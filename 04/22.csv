industrial fields. With the emergence of various CNN based solutions, the
multi-modal(RGB, depth and IR) methods based CNN showed better performance than
single modal classifiers. However, there is a need for improving the
performance and reducing the complexity. Therefore, an extreme light network
architecture(FeatherNet A/B) is proposed with a streaming module which fixes
the weakness of Global Average Pooling and uses less parameters. Our single
FeatherNet trained by depth image only, provides a higher baseline with 0.00168
ACER, 0.35M parameters and 83M FLOPS. Furthermore, a novel fusion procedure
with ``ensemble + cascade'' structure is presented to satisfy the performance
preferred use cases. Meanwhile, the MMFD dataset is collected to provide more
attacks and diversity to gain better generalization. We use the fusion method
in the Face Anti-spoofing Attack Detection Challenge@CVPR2019 and got the

cause harm (e.g. concussion). In this paper, the application of soft materials
is investigated for its potential in attenuating head's linear acceleration

materials were considered as the control factors while the noise factor was the
impact velocity. The design of experiments was based on Taguchi method. A total
of 27 experiments were conducted on a developed dummy head setup that reports
the linear acceleration of the head. ANOVA tests were performed to analyze the

miniaturization but their strong chromatic aberrations and the lack of a
varifocal achromatic element limit their utility. While exemplary broadband
achromatic metalenses are realizable via dispersion engineering, in practice,
these designs are limited to small physical apertures as large area lenses
would require phase compensating scatterers with aspect ratios infeasible for
fabrication. Many applications, however, necessitate larger areas to collect
more photons for better signal-to-noise ratio and furthermore must also operate
with unpolarized light. In this paper, we simultaneously achieve achromatic
operation at visible wavelengths and varifocal control using a
polarization-insensitive, hybrid optical-digital system with area unconstrained

focal shift control and a wide tunable focal length range of 4.8 mm (a
667-diopter change). Utilizing this conjugate pair, we realize a near

combine the metasurfaces with a post-capture deconvolution algorithm to image
full-color patterns under incoherent white light, demonstrating an achromatic

applications in various fields including augmented reality, implantable

stellar systems such as globular clusters. In addition, they are believed to
drive black hole (BH) binary mergers in these systems. A subset of
binary-single interactions are secular encounters, for which the third body
approaches the binary on a relatively wide orbit, and such that it is justified
to average the equations of motion over the binary's orbital phase. Previous
works used first-order perturbation theory to compute the effects of such
secular encounters on the binary. However, this approach can break down for
highly eccentric binaries, which are important for BH binary mergers and
gravitational wave sources. Here, we present an analytic computation using
second-order perturbation techniques, valid to the quadrupole-order
approximation. In our calculation, we take into account the instantaneous
back-reaction of the binary to the third body, and compute corrections to
previous first-order results. Using singly-averaged and direct 3-body
integrations, we demonstrate the validity of our expressions. In particular, we
show that the eccentricity change for highly eccentric binaries can reach a
plateau, associated with a large inclination change, and can even reverse sign.
These effects are not captured by previous first-order results. We provide a
simple script to conveniently evaluate our analytic expressions, including
routines for numerical integration and verification.

of a weak, rubble-pile structured body. By constructing shape models of
asteroid pairs from multiple-apparition observations and using a lightcurve
inversion technique, we mapped the gravitational and rotational accelerations
on the surfaces of these asteroids. This allows us to construct a map of local
slopes on the asteroids' surfaces. In order to test for frictional failure, we
determine the maximum rotation rate at which an area larger than half the
surface area of the secondary member (assumed to be the ejected component) has
a slope value greater than 40 degrees, the angle of friction of lunar regolith,
where loose material will begin sliding. We use this criterion to constrain the
failure stress operating on the body, just before disruption at the commonly
observed spin barrier of 2.2 h. Our current sample includes shape models of
eleven primary members of asteroid pairs, observed from the Wise Observatory in
the last decade. In the studied parameter space we find that the shape models
only reach the spin barrier when their bulk density is larger than the ~2 gr
cm-3 measured for the rubble pile structured 25143 Itokawa, suggesting that
km-sized asteroid pairs are dense compared to sub-km bodies. Assuming ejection
of secondary components that are larger than those observed (up to the maximal
size allowing separation), can also increase the spin barrier of the asteroids,
thus supporting the previously suggested scenario of continuous disruption of
the secondary. In addition, cohesion levels of hundreds of Pascals are also
required to prevent these shape models from disrupting at spin rates slower

regularization technique for nonparametric Fr\'echet regression, which refers
to a regression setting where a response residing in a metric space is paired

Specifically, we seek to approximate an unknown metric-space valued function by

same time has small total variation, appropriately defined for metric-space
valued objects. We show that the resulting estimator is representable by a
piece-wise constant function and establish the minimax convergence rate of the
proposed estimator for metric data objects that reside in Hadamard spaces. We
illustrate the numerical performance of the proposed method for both simulated

reduces to an assignment problem which can be solved by weighted bipartite
matching. Furthermore, we consider the max-min fairness of data rates with

calibrated by the results from the \emph{ab initio} non-perturbative

relaxed notion of graph isomorphism. Our method consists of three parts. First,
we learn an encoder for each anchor graph to capture its structure. Second, for
each pair of graphs, we train a cross-graph attention network which uses the
node representations of an anchor graph to reconstruct another graph. This
approach, which we call isomorphism attention, captures how well the
representations of one graph can encode another. We use the attention-augmented
encoder's predictions to define a divergence score for each pair of graphs.
Finally, we construct an embedding space for all graphs using these pair-wise
divergence scores.
  Unlike previous work, much of which relies on 1) supervision, 2) domain
specific knowledge (e.g. a reliance on Weisfeiler-Lehman kernels), and 3) known
node alignment, our unsupervised method jointly learns node representations,
graph representations, and an attention-based alignment between graphs.
  Our experimental results show that Deep Divergence Graph Kernels can learn an
unsupervised alignment between graphs, and that the learned representations
achieve competitive results when used as features on a number of challenging
graph classification tasks. Furthermore, we illustrate how the learned
attention allows insight into the the alignment of sub-structures across
graphs.

Lofted aerosols and disequilibrium chemistry are caused by vigorous vertical

parameter space of spin-synchronized gas giants. In order to understand how
tracer transport depends on planetary parameters, we develop an analytic theory
to predict vertical velocities and mixing rates ($K_\mathrm{zz}$) and compare
the results to our numerical experiments. We find that both our theory and
numerical simulations predict that, if the vertical mixing rate is described by
an eddy diffusivity, then this eddy diffusivity $K_\mathrm{zz}$ should increase
with increasing equilibrium temperature, decreasing frictional drag strength,
and increasing chemical loss timescales. We find that the transition in our
numerical simulations between circulation dominated by a superrotating jet and
that with solely day-to-night flow causes a marked change in the vertical
velocity structure and tracer distribution. The mixing ratio of passive tracers
is greatest for intermediate drag strengths that corresponds to this transition
between a superrotating jet with columnar vertical velocity structure and
day-to-night flow with upwelling on the dayside and downwelling on the
nightside. Lastly, we present analytic solutions for $K_\mathrm{zz}$ as a
function of planetary effective temperature, chemical loss timescales, and

scale external magnetic fields in accretion discs. The most plausible theories
for launching astrophysical jets rely on strong magnetic fields at the inner
parts of the host accretion disks. An internal dynamo can in principle generate
small scale magnetic fields in situ but generating a large scale field in a
disk seems a difficult task in the dynamo theories. In fact, as far as numerous
numerical experiments indicate, a dynamo-generated field in general would not
be coherent enough over the large length scales of order the disk's radius.
Instead, a large scale poloidal field dragged in from the environment, and
compressed by the accretion, provides a more promising possibility. The
difficulty in the latter picture, however, arises from the reconnection of the
radial field component across the mid-plane which annihilates the field faster
than it is dragged inward by the accretion. We review the different mechanisms
proposed to overcome these theoretical difficulties. In fact, it turns out,
that a combination of different effects, including magnetic buoyancy and
turbulent pumping, is responsible for the vertical transport of the field lines
toward the surface of the disk. The radial component of the poloidal field
vanishes at the mid-plane, which efficiently impedes reconnection, and grows
exponentially toward the surface where it can become much larger than the
vertical field component. This allows the poloidal field to be efficiently
advected to small radii until the allowed bending angle drops to of order
unity, and the field can drive a strong outflow.

a Cahn-Hilliard phase-field based approach, that includes simple models for
nucleation, irradiating particle and rate dependent radiation-enhanced
diffusion and cascade mixing to simulate {\alpha}' evolution under neutrons,
heavy ions, and electron irradiations. Different irradiating particles manifest
very different cascade mixing efficiencies. The model was calibrated using
neutron data. For cascade inducing neutron/heavy-ion dpa rates at 300 {\deg}C
between 10^-^8 and 10^-^6 dpa/s the model predicts approximately constant
number density, decreasing radius, decreasing {\alpha}' Cr composition, and
lower {\alpha}' volume fraction. The model then predicts a dramatic transition
to no {\alpha}' formation above approximately 10^-^5 dpa/s, while electron
irradiation, with weak mixing, had little effect at dpa rates up to 10^-^3
dpa/s. These model predictions are consistent with experiments. We explain the
results in terms of the flux dependence of the radiation enhanced diffusion,
cascade mixing, and their ratio, which all vary significantly in relevant flux
ranges for neutron and cascade inducing ion irradiations. These results show
that both cascade mixing and radiation enhanced diffusion must be accounted for

is a strong dependence of any spatially homogeneous base states on time, and
the resulting structure of the linearized perturbations used to determine the
onset of instability is inherently non-autonomous. We obtain general conditions
for the onset and structure of diffusion driven instabilities in
reaction-diffusion systems on domains which evolve in time, in terms of the
time-evolution of the Laplace-Beltrami spectrum for the domain and functions
which specify the domain evolution. Our results give sufficient conditions for
diffusive instabilities phrased in terms of differential inequalities which are
both versatile and straightforward to implement, despite the generality of the

the literature, such as the algebraic inequalities commonly used as a
sufficient criterion for the Turing instability on static domains, and
approximate asymptotic results valid for specific types of growth, or specific

even when the domain changes rapidly in time, or when the homogeneous state is
oscillatory, such as in the case of Turing-Hopf instabilities. Extensions to
higher-order spatial systems are also included as a way of demonstrating the

accelerates the ordering rate of stoichiometric Ni_2Cr in Ni-Cr alloys. A
series of Ni-33%Cr-x%P samples (in atomic percent) were fabricated with
phosphorus concentrations, x = <0.005-0.1 at.% and aged between 373 and
470{\deg}C for times up to 3000 h. The first-principles modeling considers fcc
Ni with dilute P as a reasonable approximation for the complex Ni-Cr-P alloy
system. Calculation results show a pronounced enhancement of vacancy transport
by vacancy-solute pair diffusion via consecutive exchange and rotation jumps of
vacancies associated with the phosphorus atom. The energy barriers of these two
migration paths are at least 0.35 eV lower than that of vacancy-atom exchange
in pure Ni solvent. The analytical diffusion model predicts enhanced solvent
diffusion by 2 orders of magnitude for 0.1 at.% P at 400-500{\deg}C. The model
prediction is in good agreement with the evolution of micro-hardness. We
characterize the micro-hardness result by a kinetic ordering model, showing a
significant decrease of the activation energy of ordering transformation. These
results help gauge the risk of industrial alloys developing long range order
which increases strength but degrades ductility and toughness. Specifically,
minor alloying additions that bind with excess vacancies and lower the vacancy
migration barrier can greatly accelerate hardening via Ni_2Cr precipitation.

time series. The best known algorithms for computing DTW run in near quadratic
time, and conditional lower bounds prohibit the existence of significantly
faster algorithms. The lower bounds do not prevent a faster algorithm for the
special case in which the DTW is small, however. For an arbitrary metric space
$\Sigma$ with distances normalized so that the smallest non-zero distance is
one, we present an algorithm which computes $\operatorname{dtw}(x, y)$ for two
strings $x$ and $y$ over $\Sigma$ in time $O(n \cdot \operatorname{dtw}(x,
y))$. We also present an approximation algorithm which computes
$\operatorname{dtw}(x, y)$ within a factor of $O(n^\epsilon)$ in time
$\tilde{O}(n^{2 - \epsilon})$ for $0 < \epsilon < 1$. The algorithm allows for
the strings $x$ and $y$ to be taken over an arbitrary well-separated tree
metric with logarithmic depth and at most exponential aspect ratio. Extending
our techniques further, we also obtain the first approximation algorithm for
edit distance to work with characters taken from an arbitrary metric space,
providing an $n^\epsilon$-approximation in time $\tilde{O}(n^{2 - \epsilon})$,
with high probability. Additionally, we present a simple reduction from
computing edit distance to computing DTW. Applying our reduction to a
conditional lower bound of Bringmann and K\""unnemann pertaining to edit
distance over $\{0, 1\}$, we obtain a conditional lower bound for computing DTW
over a three letter alphabet (with distances of zero and one). This improves on
a previous result of Abboud, Backurs, and Williams. With a similar approach, we
prove a reduction from computing edit distance to computing longest LCS length.
This means that one can recover conditional lower bounds for LCS directly from

third-order nonlinear optical coefficients of o = e + o generating THz waves
from E symmetric TO modes. The intensities of four THz waves are calculated by
solving coupled wave equations. The calculation results demonstrate that the

especially in big crowded cities, causing traffic congestion and air pollution,
and wasting drivers' time. Smart parking systems are a novel solution to enable
drivers to have real-time parking information for pre-booking. However, current
smart parking requires drivers to disclose their private information, such as
desired destinations. Moreover, the existing schemes are centralized and
vulnerable to the bottleneck of the single point of failure and data breaches.
In this paper, we propose a distributed privacy-preserving smart parking system
using blockchain. A consortium blockchain created by different parking lot
owners to ensure security, transparency, and availability is proposed to store
their parking offers on the blockchain. To preserve drivers' location privacy,
we adopt a private information retrieval (PIR) technique to enable drivers to
retrieve parking offers from blockchain nodes privately, without revealing
which parking offers are retrieved. Furthermore, a short randomizable signature
is used to enable drivers to reserve available parking slots in an anonymous
manner. Besides, we introduce an anonymous payment system that cannot link
drivers' to specific parking locations. Finally, our performance evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed scheme can preserve drivers' privacy with low

The

field generated by free charges, which are created by ionizing atoms. This
suppression is called Coulomb blockade. Here the Coulomb forces are created by
ions through ionizing atoms by a UV laser. The theory shows that the
interaction, which causes the suppression, is primarily caused by charge-dipole
interactions. Here the charge is the ion, and the dipole is an atom. In this
experiment, we use $^{85}$Rb atoms. The valence electron and the ion core are
the two poles of an electric dipole. The interaction potential energy between
the ion and the atom is proportional to $\frac{1}{R^2}$, and the frequency
shift caused by this interaction is proportional to $\frac{1}{R^4}$, where $R$
is the distance between the ion and the dipole considered. This research can be
used for quantum information storage, remote control, creating hot plasmas

selectively takes the difference between target and source attribute vectors as

encoder-decoder to adaptively select and modify encoder feature for enhanced

sublinear time for analyzing the cluster structure of the graph are receiving
growing interest. Two typical examples are local graph clustering algorithms
that find a cluster from a seed node with running time proportional to the size
of the output set, and clusterability testing algorithms that decide if a graph
can be partitioned into a few clusters in the framework of property testing.
  In this work, we develop sublinear time algorithms for analyzing the cluster
structure of graphs with noisy partial information. By using conductance based
definitions for measuring the quality of clusters and the cluster structure, we
formalize a definition of noisy clusterable graphs with bounded maximum degree.
The algorithm is given query access to the adjacency list to such a graph. We
then formalize the notion of robust clustering oracle for a noisy clusterable
graph, and give an algorithm that builds such an oracle in sublinear time,
which can be further used to support typical queries (e.g., IsOutlier($s$),
SameCluster($s,t$)) regarding the cluster structure of the graph in sublinear
time. All the answers are consistent with a partition of $G$ in which all but a
small fraction of vertices belong to some good cluster. We also give a local
reconstructor for a noisy clusterable graph that provides query access to a
reconstructed graph that is guaranteed to be clusterable in sublinear time. All
the query answers are consistent with a clusterable graph which is guaranteed
to be close to the original graph.

the worst-case time as a function of $d$, the distance of the exit from the

single robot traveling at unit speed, the search time is at least $9d-o(d)$. It
was shown recently that $k\geq2$ robots traveling at unit speed also require at
least $9d$ group search time.
  We investigate energy-time trade-offs in group search by two robots, where
the energy loss experienced by a robot traveling a distance $x$ at constant
speed $s$ is given by $s^2 x$. Specifically, we consider the problem of
minimizing the total energy used by the robots, under the constraints that the
search time is at most a multiple $c$ of the distance $d$ and the speed of the
robots is bounded by $b$. Motivation for this study is that for the case when
robots must complete the search in $9d$ time with maximum speed one, a single
robot requires at least $9d$ energy, while for two robots, all previously
proposed algorithms consume at least $28d/3$ energy.
  When the robots have bounded memory, we generalize existing algorithms to
obtain a family of optimal (and in some cases nearly optimal) algorithms
parametrized by pairs of $b,c$ values that can solve the problem for the entire
spectrum of these pairs for which the problem is solvable. We also propose a
novel search algorithm, with unbounded memory, that simultaneously achieves
search time $9d$ and consumes energy $8.42588d$. Our result shows that two
robots can search on the line in optimal time $9d$ while consuming less total
energy than a single robot within the same search time.

interfacial strains has considerable potential for the development of future
devices using spins and orbitals. For the fundamental physics, the relationship
between strain and orbital magnetic moment is still unknown, because there are
few tools to probe changes of orbital magnetic moment. In this study, we
developed an electric-field- (E)-induced X-ray magnetic circular dichroism
(EXMCD) technique to apply E to a ferroelectric BaTiO3 substrate. We reversibly
tuned the interfacial lattice constants of Ni/Cu multilayers on BaTiO3 using
this technique. As the domain structures in BaTiO3 are modulated by E, EXMCD
measurements reveal that the changes in the magnetic anisotropy of Ni/Cu films
are induced through the modulation of orbital magnetic moments in Ni with
magneto-elastic contributions. The strained Ni layer that induces the
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy without E is released at E = 8 kV/cm, and
in-plane magnetization also occurs. We observed that EXMCD measurements
clarified the origin of the reversible changes in perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy and established the relationship between macroscopic inverse
magnetostriction effects and microscopic orbital moment anisotropy.

Access Memory (DRAM), which was initially introduced by Kim et al. at the ISCA
2014 conference~\cite{rowhammer-isca2014}. RowHammer is a prime (and perhaps
the first) example of how a circuit-level failure mechanism can cause a
practical and widespread system security vulnerability. It is the phenomenon
that repeatedly accessing a row in a modern DRAM chip causes bit flips in
physically-adjacent rows at consistently predictable bit locations. RowHammer
is caused by a hardware failure mechanism called {\em DRAM disturbance errors},
which is a manifestation of circuit-level cell-to-cell interference in a scaled
memory technology.
  Researchers from Google Project Zero demonstrated in 2015 that this hardware
failure mechanism can be effectively exploited by user-level programs to gain
kernel privileges on real systems. Many other follow-up works demonstrated
other practical attacks exploiting RowHammer. In this article, we
comprehensively survey the scientific literature on RowHammer-based attacks as
well as mitigation techniques to prevent RowHammer. We also discuss what other
related vulnerabilities may be lurking in DRAM and other types of memories,
e.g., NAND flash memory or Phase Change Memory, that can potentially threaten
the foundations of secure systems, as the memory technologies scale to higher
densities. We conclude by describing and advocating a principled approach to
memory reliability and security research that can enable us to better
anticipate and prevent such vulnerabilities.

one-dimensional quantum transverse compass model with both the nearest-neighbor
interactions and transverse fields varying over space. By transforming the spin
system into a quadratic Majorana-fermion model, we derive an exact formula for
the number of the emergent EMZMs, which is found to depend on the partition
nature of the lattice sites on which the magnetic fields vanish. We also derive
explicit expressions for the wavefunctions of these EMZMs and show that they
indeed depend on fine features of the foregoing partition of site indices.
Based on the above rigorous results about the EMZMs, we provide an
interpretation for the interesting dependence of the eigenstate-degeneracy on
the transverse fields observed in prior literatures. As a special case, we
employ a plane-wave ansatz to exactly solve an open compass chain with
alternating nearest-neighbor interactions and staggered magnetic fields.
Explicit forms of the canonical Majorana modes diagonalizing the model are
given even for finite chains. We show that besides the possibly existing EMZMs,
no almost Majorana zero modes exist unless the fields on both the two
sublattices are turned off. Our results might shed light on the control of
ground-state degeneracies by solely tuning the external fields in related

the linearly increasing input channel by dense connection leads to heavy memory

phase is investigated by numerical experiments. The barotropic relation of
primordial gas and artificial stiffening of the equation of state in very dense
regions ($> 10^{15}~{\rm cm}^{-3}$) enables us to follow the fragmentation of
PopIII circumstellar disks and the merging processes of the fragments. The disk
becomes gravitationally unstable to fragmentation , followed by a rapid merger
process typically within 100 yrs, which roughly corresponds to one orbital time
of the circumstellar disk. We also find that the fragmentation of the gas disk
around a multiple system, a circumbinary disk, is rare; however, it is frequent
in the disk around an individual protostar. We also perform a simulation with
standard sink particles, where the number and total mass of sink particles are
in rough agreement with those of the stiff equation of state runs. Based on the
results of these numerical results, we model the evolution of the number of
fragments with a simple phenomenological equation. We find that the average
number of fragments is roughly proportional to $t^{0.3}$, where $t$ is the
elapsed time since the formation of the first protostar. Next, we compare this
trend with a number of published numerical studies by scaling the elapsed time
according to the scale-free nature of the system. As a result, we find most of
the results in the literature agree well with the relation. Present results
combined with the previous studies in the literature imply that the PopIII

ability of CEST MR-Fingerprinting (MRF) to discriminate different chemical
exchange parameters and to provide tools for optimal acquisition schedule
design and parameter map reconstruction. Methods: Numerical simulations were
conducted using a parallel-computing implementation of the Bloch-McConnell
equations, examining the effect of TR, TE, flip-angle, water T$_{1}$ and
T$_{2}$, saturation-pulse duration, power, and frequency on the discrimination
ability of CEST-MRF. A modified Euclidean-distance matching metric was
evaluated and compared to traditional dot-product matching. L-Arginine phantoms
of various concentrations and pH were scanned at 4.7T and the results compared
to numerical findings. Results: Simulations for dot-product matching
demonstrated that the optimal flip-angle and saturation times are 30$^{\circ}$
and 1100 ms, respectively. The optimal maximal saturation power was 3.4 $\mu$T
for concentrated solutes with a slow exchange-rate, and 5.2 $\mu$T for dilute
solutes with medium-to-fast exchange-rates. Using the Euclidean-distance
matching metric, much lower maximum saturation powers were required (1.6 and
2.4 $\mu$T, respectively), with a slightly longer saturation time (1500 ms) and
90$^{\circ}$ flip-angle. For both matching metrics, the discrimination ability
increased with the repetition time. The experimental results were in agreement
with simulations, demonstrating that more than a 50% reduction in scan-time can
be achieved by Euclidean-distance-based matching. Conclusion: Optimization of
the CEST-MRF acquisition schedule is critical for obtaining the best exchange
parameter accuracy. The use of Euclidean-distance-based matching of signal
trajectories simultaneously improved the discrimination ability and reduced the
scan time and maximal saturation power required.

is instead used as external informative constraint to the maximization of the
convex Shannon's entropy function. The problem involves the re-parameterization
of the score parameters as expected values of discrete probability
distributions where probabilities need to be estimated. This leads to a simpler
situation where parameters are searched in smaller (hyper) simplex space. We
assessed our proposal by means of empirical case studies and a simulation
study, this latter involving the most critical case of logistic regression
under data separation. The results suggested that the maximum entropy
re-formulation of the score problem solves the likelihood equation problem.
Similarly, when maximum-likelihood estimation is difficult, as for the case of
logistic regression under separation, the maximum entropy proposal achieved
results (numerically) comparable to those obtained by the Firth's
Bias-corrected approach. Overall, these first findings reveal that a maximum

networks (CNNs). They either standardize or whiten data using statistics
estimated in predefined sets of pixels. Unlike existing works that design
normalization techniques for specific tasks, we propose Switchable Whitening
(SW), which provides a general form unifying different whitening methods as
well as standardization methods. SW learns to switch among these operations in
an end-to-end manner. It has several advantages. First, SW adaptively selects
appropriate whitening or standardization statistics for different tasks (see
Fig.1), making it well suited for a wide range of tasks without manual design.
Second, by integrating benefits of different normalizers, SW shows consistent
improvements over its counterparts in various challenging benchmarks. Third, SW
serves as a useful tool for understanding the characteristics of whitening and
standardization techniques. We show that SW outperforms other alternatives on
image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), semantic segmentation (ADE20K,
Cityscapes), domain adaptation (GTA5, Cityscapes), and image style transfer
(COCO). For example, without bells and whistles, we achieve state-of-the-art
performance with 45.33% mIoU on the ADE20K dataset. Code is available at

However, since label quality is often difficult to guarantee, sometimes the use

performance degradation or poor performance gains. Moreover, it is usually not
feasible to manually increase the label quality, which results in weakly
supervised learning being somewhat difficult to rely on. In view of this
crucial issue, this paper proposes a simple and novel weakly supervised
learning framework. We guide the optimization of label quality through a small

maximizing performance gain. As validation set is a good approximation for
describing generalization risk, it can effectively avoid the unsatisfactory

this underlying consideration into a novel Bi-Level optimization and give an

Next, we exploit an affine transformation to align the local deep features of

procedures encode the interdependencies between neighbourhoods into the final

competitive with several well-known dimension reduction techniques, and

grows deeper, which allows us to build deep DACNNs without any concern about

deep learning f0 extraction methods that exploit the quasi periodic nature of

reliably extract the pitch from various modes of the acoustic signal. In this
work, we propose a hybrid f0 extraction method which seamlessly extracts the
pitch across modes of speech production with very high accuracy required for
many applications. The proposed hybrid model exploits the advantages of deep
learning and signal processing methods to minimize the pitch detection error
and adopts to various modes of acoustic signal. Specifically, we propose an
ordinal regression convolutional neural networks to map the periodicity rich
input representation to obtain the nominal pitch classes which drastically
reduces the number of classes required for pitch detection unlike other deep
learning approaches. Further, the accurate f0 is estimated from the nominal
pitch class labels by filtering and autocorrelation. We show that the proposed
method generalizes to the unseen modes of voice production and various noises
for large scale datasets. Also, the proposed hybrid model significantly reduces
the learning parameters required to train the deep model compared to other

the previous works focus mainly on the cases where the inputs are
non-superposed states, for instance, products of Fock states [Phys. Rev. Letts.
105 (2010) 090501]. A natural question that arises is how the superpositions
affect the quantum correlations. Following this trail, the comparison between
superpositions and products of Fock states is performed. It is found an
interesting phenomenon that for the superposition and the corresponding product
of Fock state (non-Gaussian states), their averaged quantum correlations are
nearly same, whereas the distributions of their quantum correlations might be
different. Therefore, superpositions may affect the distributions of the
quantum correlations. In addition, to examine how the Gaussian states affect
the quantum correlations, we compare the typical Gaussian states with the
non-Gaussian states (superpositions and products of Fock states). It is
discovered that the non-Gaussian-state input could result in the quantum
correlation that is either positive or negative, depending on the number of the
input modes and the number of the photons in each mode, whereas the
Gaussian-state input always leads to the non-negative quantum correlation.
Besides, it is demonstrated that with the increase of the disorder strength,
the mean strength of the quantum correlation increases for multi-mode-state
inputs (except for multi-mode-coherent-state inputs). These results may be
useful to control and adjust the quantum properties of scattered modes after
the quantized lights propagating through the disordered medium.

for example in phylogenetics. There they are for instance used to test whether
an observed phylogenetic tree differs significantly from a tree generated by
the Yule model of speciation. One of the most popular indices in this regard is
the Colless index, which measures the degree of balance for rooted binary
trees. While many statistical properties of the Colless index (e.g. asymptotic
results for its mean and variance under different models of speciation) have
already been discussed in different contexts, we focus on its extremal
properties. While it is relatively straightforward to characterize trees with
maximal Colless index, the analysis of the minimal value of the Colless index
and the characterization of trees that achieve it, are much more involved. In
this note, we therefore focus on the minimal value of the Colless index for any
given number of leaves. We derive both a recursive formula for this minimal
value, as well as an explicit expression, which shows a surprising connection
between the Colless index and the so-called Blancmange curve, a fractal curve
that is also known as the Takagi curve. Moreover, we characterize two classes
of trees that have minimal Colless index, consisting of the set of so-called
\emph{maximally balanced trees} and a class of trees that we call \emph{greedy
from the bottom trees}. Furthermore, we derive an upper bound for the number of
trees with minimal Colless index by relating these trees with trees with
minimal Sackin index (another well-studied index of tree balance).

to alleviate this problem by proposing a new generative network that relies on
the use of random discriminators instead of adversarial design. This design
helps us to avoid the min-max formulation and leads to an optimization problem
that is stable and could be solved efficiently. The performance of the proposed
method is evaluated using handwritten digits (MNIST) and Fashion products

(OTOC), has attracted much attention, as it sheds new light on chaotic dynamics
in quantum many-body systems. The scale invariance, which appears near the
quantum critical region in condensed matter physics, is considered to be
important for the fast decay of the OTOC. In this paper, we focus on the
one-dimensional spin-1/2 XXZ model, which exhibits quantum criticality in a
certain parameter region, and investigate the relationship between scrambling
and the scale invariance. We quantify scrambling by the averaged OTOC over the
Pauli operator basis, which is related to the operator space entanglement
entropy (OSEE). Using the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD)
method, we numerically calculate time dependence of the OSEE in the early time
region in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the averaged OTOC decays faster
in the gapless region than in the gapped region. In the gapless region, the
averaged OTOC behaves in the same manner regardless of the anisotropy
parameter. This result is consistent with the fact that the low energy
excitations of the gapless region belong to the same universality class as the
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid with the central charge c = 1. Furthermore, we
estimate c by fitting the numerical data of the OSEE with an analytical result
of the two-dimensional conformal field theory, and confirmed that c is close to
unity. Thus, our numerical results suggest that the scale invariance is crucial
for the universal behavior of the OTOC.

non-linear constraints that arise out of manipulator kinematics and its
coupling with the mobile base in a multi-affine form. We then use techniques
from Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to formulate and solve
the trajectory optimization problem. The proposed ADMM has two similar

result than traditional methods. Since CNN has a very large capacity, training
such a neural network often requires many data, but it is often expensive to
obtain labeled images in real practice, especially for object detection, where
collecting bounding box of every object in training set requires many human
efforts. This is the case in detection of retail products where there can be
many different categories. In this paper, we focus on applying CNN to detect
324-categories products in situ, while requiring no extra effort of labeling
bounding box for any image. Our approach is based on an algorithm that extracts
bounding box from in-vitro dataset and an algorithm to simulate occlusion. We

Specifically, a comprehensive framework is developed to model and characterize

substantial attention in the literature. However, insufficient work has been
done in incorporating prior structural knowledge onto the learning of
underlying graphical models from data. Learning a graph with a specific
structure is essential for interpretability and identification of the
relationships among data. Useful structured graphs include the multi-component
graph, bipartite graph, connected graph, sparse graph, and regular graph. In
general, structured graph learning is an NP-hard combinatorial problem,
therefore, designing a general tractable optimization method is extremely
challenging. In this paper, we introduce a unified graph learning framework
lying at the integration of Gaussian graphical models and spectral graph
theory. To impose a particular structure on a graph, we first show how to
formulate the combinatorial constraints as an analytical property of the graph
matrix. Then we develop an optimization framework that leverages graph learning
with specific structures via spectral constraints on graph matrices. The
proposed algorithms are provably convergent, computationally efficient, and
practically amenable for numerous graph-based tasks. Extensive numerical
experiments with both synthetic and real data sets illustrate the effectiveness
of the proposed algorithms. The code for all the simulations is made available

scattering interactions with nucleons or leptons. These collisions transfer the
dark matter kinetic energy to the star, resulting in appreciable heating that
is potentially observable by forthcoming infrared telescopes. While previous
work considered scattering only on nucleons, neutron stars contain small
abundances of other particle species, including electrons and muons. We perform
a detailed analysis of the neutron star kinetic heating constraints on
leptophilic dark matter. We also estimate the size of loop induced couplings to
quarks, arising from the exchange of photons and Z bosons. Despite having
relatively small lepton abundances, we find that an observation of an old,
cold, neutron star would provide very strong limits on dark matter interactions
with leptons, with the greatest reach arising from scattering off muons. The
projected sensitivity is orders of magnitude more powerful than current dark
matter-electron scattering bounds from terrestrial direct detection
experiments.

CAPTCHA, which is to discriminate algorithm from human by offering
recognition-alike questions. The recent development of deep learning has
significantly advanced the capability of algorithm in solving CAPTCHA
questions, forcing CAPTCHA designers to increase question complexity. Instead
of designing questions difficult for both algorithm and human, this study
attempts to employ the limitations of algorithm to design robust CAPTCHA
questions easily solvable to human. Specifically, our data analysis observes
that human and algorithm demonstrates different vulnerability to visual
distortions: adversarial perturbation is significantly annoying to algorithm
yet friendly to human. We are motivated to employ adversarially perturbed
images for robust CAPTCHA design in the context of character-based questions.
Three modules of multi-target attack, ensemble adversarial training, and image
preprocessing differentiable approximation are proposed to address the
characteristics of character-based CAPTCHA cracking. Qualitative and
quantitative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed

dynamics for both deterministic and random multi-player two-strategy
evolutionary games. For deterministic games, using Decartes' rule of signs, we
provide a formula to compute the number of equilibria in multi-player games via
the number of change of signs in the coefficients of a polynomial. For
two-player social dilemmas (namely, the Prisoner's Dilemma, Snowdrift, Stag
Hunt, and Harmony), we characterize (stable) equilibrium points and
analytically calculate the probability of having a certain number of equilibria
when the payoff entries are uniformly distributed. For multi-player random
games whose payoffs are independently distributed according to a normal
distribution, by employing techniques from random polynomial theory, we compute
the expected or average number of internal equilibria. In addition, we perform
extensive simulations by sampling and averaging over a large number of possible
payoff matrices to compare with and illustrate analytical results. Numerical
simulations also suggest several interesting behaviour of the average number of
equilibria when the number of players is sufficiently large or when the
mutation is sufficiently small. In general, we observe that introducing
mutation results in a larger average number of internal equilibria than when
mutation is absent, implying that mutation leads to larger behavioural
diversity in dynamical systems. Interestingly, this number is largest when
mutation is rare rather than when it is frequent.

theory, with confined quarks and deconfined gluons. We introduce the quarks to
the theory by embedding a probe D7-brane in the gravity side, and turn on an
appropriate $U(1)$ gauge field on the flavor brane to describe the electric
field. Studying the embedding of the D7-brane for different values of the
electric field, instanton density and quark masses, we thoroughly explore the
possible phases of the system. We find two critical points in our
considerations. We show that beside the usual critical electric field present
in deconfined theories, there exists another critical field, with smaller
value, below which no quark pairs even the ones with zero mass are produced and
thus the electric current is zero in this (insulator) phase. At the same point,
the chiral symmetry, spontaneously broken due to the gluon condensate, is
restored which shows a first order phase transition. Finally, we obtain the
full decay rate calculating the imaginary part of the DBI action of the probe
brane and find that it becomes nonzero only when the critical value of the
electric field is reached.

decisions will affect the workers' task selection strategies and the quality of

the workers' bounded cognitive rationality interacts with and affects the
decisions and performance of a multimedia crowdsourcing system. Specifically,
we consider a two-stage model, where a requester first determines the reward
and the quality requirement for each task, and the workers select the tasks to
accomplish accordingly. First, we consider the benchmark case where users are
fully rational, and derive the requester's optimal rewards and quality
requirements for the tasks. Next, we focus on the more practical bounded
rational case by modeling the workers' task selection behaviors using the
cognitive hierarchy theory. Comparing with the fully rational benchmark, we
show that the requester can increase her profit by taking advantage of the
workers' bounded cognitive rationality, especially when the workers' population
is large or the workers' average cognitive level is low. When the workers'
average cognitive level is very high, however, the equilibrium under the
practical bounded rational model converges to that under the benchmark fully
rational model. It is because workers at different levels make decisions
sequentially and high cognitive level workers can accurately predict other
users' strategies. Under both the fully and bounded rational models, we show
that if workers are heterogeneous but one type of workers (either the high or
the low quality) dominates the platform, the requester cannot make a higher
profit by setting different quality requirements for different tasks.

(NLO) and, for the first time, at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the
$\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ factorization scheme with five massless quark flavors.
This new determination of FFs is based on the QCD fit to the {\tt OPAL}
experimental data for hadron production in the electron-positron
single-inclusive annihilation (SIA). We discuss in detail the novel aspects of
the methodology used in our analysis and the validity of obtained FFs by
comparing with previous works in literature which have been carried out up to
NLO accuracy. We will also incorporate the effect of charmed meson mass
corrections into our QCD analysis and discuss the improvements upon inclusion
of these effects. The uncertainties in the extracted FFs as well as in the
corresponding observables are estimated using the ""Hessian"" approach. For a
typical application, we use our new FFs to make theoretical predictions for the
energy distributions of charmed mesons inclusively produced through the decay
of unpolarized top quarks, to be measured at the CERN LHC. As a result of this
analysis, suggestions are discussed for possible future studies on the current
topic to consider any theory improvements and other available experimental
observables.

reconnection, which occurs on an Alfv\'enic, not a resistive time scale, in
plasmas that are evolving in the near-ideal limit. The primary application has
been to three-dimensional naturally-occurring plasmas. A magnetic field
representation that applies to all magnetic fields allows features of magnetic
evolution in toroidal and natural plasmas to be compared. This comparison
illustrates why plasmoid models of magnetic field evolution are not robust
solutions to Maxwell's equations. Despite five-hundred papers on plasmoid

find a rank-$k$ matrix $L$ for which: $$cost(L) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j =
1}^{n} W_{i,j} \cdot (A_{i,j} - L_{i,j} )^2 \leq OPT + \epsilon \|A\|_F^2 ,$$
where $OPT = \min_{rank-k\ \hat{L}} cost(\hat L)$ and $\epsilon$ is a given
error parameter. Depending on the choice of $W$, this problem captures factor
analysis, low-rank plus diagonal decomposition, robust PCA, low-rank matrix
completion, low-rank plus block matrix approximation, and many problems. Many
of these problems are NP-hard, and while some algorithms with provable
guarantees are known, they either 1) run in time $n^{\Omega(k^2/\epsilon)}$ or
2) make strong assumptions, e.g., that $A$ is incoherent or that $W$ is random.
  In this work, we show that a common polynomial time heuristic, which simply
sets $A$ to $0$ where $W$ is $0$, and then finds a standard low-rank
approximation, yields bicriteria approximation guarantees for this problem. In
particular, for rank $k' > k$ depending on the $public\ coin\ partition\
number$ of $W$, the heuristic outputs rank-$k'$ $L$ with cost$(L) \leq OPT +
\epsilon \|A\|_F^2$. This partition number is in turn bounded by the
$randomized\ communication\ complexity$ of $W$, when interpreted as a
two-player communication matrix. For many important examples of masked low-rank
approximation, including all those listed above, this result yields bicriteria
approximation guarantees with $k' = k \cdot poly(\log n/\epsilon)$.
  Further, we show that different models of communication yield algorithms for
natural variants of masked low-rank approximation. For example, multi-player
number-in-hand communication complexity connects to masked tensor decomposition
and non-deterministic communication complexity to masked Boolean low-rank
factorization.

compresses the C60 molecules against the substrate, and graphene attachment to

height of graphene wrinkles, configurations with both frozen and non-frozen

stable sagged graphene when the distance between C60s is about 4 nm and height
of graphene wrinkles is about 0.8 nm. Below the distance of 4 nm between C60s,
graphene becomes locally suspended and less strained. We show that this happens
when C60s are allowed to deform under the compressive action of graphene. If we

energy and Green function is derived from the model's Hamiltonian, which is not
available for our case. Here, we have devised a new method to derive the total
energy formula purely from a path integral description of the system, without
resort to its Hamiltonian formulation. Since not all systems can be described
by a Hamiltonian, thus our method has a wider applicability. It is noteworthy
that the total energy formula that we derived here takes an identical form with
that obtained from a model's Hamiltonian.

learning-based approach to estimate the camera wearer's 3D body pose from

another person---whose body pose we can directly observe---as a signal
inherently linked to the body pose of the first-person subject. We show that
since interactions between individuals often induce a well-ordered series of
back-and-forth responses, it is possible to learn a temporal model of the
interlinked poses even though one party is largely out of view. We demonstrate
our idea on a variety of domains with dyadic interaction and show the
substantial impact on egocentric body pose estimation, which improves the state

the space-time structure of the renormalizable bottom quark Yukawa interactions

that, it is always possible, by chiral rotations, to transform between scalar
and pseudoscalar Yukawa interactions without affecting the interactions of
bottom quarks with SM gauge bosons. Since these rotations affect only the
$b$-quark mass terms in the Standard Model Lagrangian, any differences in
observables for scalar versus pseudoscalar couplings vanish when $m_b
\rightarrow 0$, and are strongly suppressed in high energy processes involving
the heavy spin-zero particle where the $b$-quarks are typically relativistic.
We show, however, that the energy dependence of, for instance, $e^+e^-
\rightarrow b\bar{b} X$ (here $X$ denotes the spin-zero particle) close to the
reaction threshold may serve to provide a distinction between the scalar versus
pseudoscalar coupling at electron-positron colliders that are being proposed,
provided that the $Xb\bar{b}$ coupling is sizeable. We also note that while
various kinematic distributions for $t \bar{t} h$ are indeed sensitive to the
space-time structure of the top Yukawa coupling, for a spin-0 particle $X$ of
an arbitrary mass, the said sensitivity is lost if $m_{X} >> m_t$.

vacuum-torsion, radiation-torsion, dust-torsion, stiff fluid torsion, and
radiation-dust-torsion multi-fluid systems. The obtained Lagrangians have, in

For the simplest CG models, however, it is possible to reconstruct $f(T)$

important for a comprehensive theory of planet formation. Most stars are born
in dense star-forming regions where the external influence of other stars,
particularly the most massive stars, will affect the survival and enrichment of
their planet-forming discs. Simulations suggest that stellar dynamics play a
central role in regulating how external feedback affects discs, but comparing
models to observations requires an estimate of the initial stellar density in
star-forming regions. Structural analyses constrain the amount of dynamical
evolution a star-forming region has experienced; regions that maintain
substructure and do not show mass segregation are likely dynamically young, and
therefore close to their birth density. In this paper, we present a structural
analysis of two clusters in the Carina Nebula, Tr14 and Tr16. We show that
neither cluster shows evidence for mass segregation or a centrally concentrated
morphology, suggesting that both regions are dynamically young. This allows us
to compare to simulations from Nicholson et al. (2019) who predict disc
survival rates in star-forming regions of different initial densities. The
surviving disc fractions in Tr14 and Tr16 are consistent with their predictions
(both are $\sim 10$%), supporting a growing body of evidence that the
star-forming environment plays an important role in the survival and enrichment
of protoplanetary discs.

relativistic gas, which assumes that all particles have the same momentum
magnitude. Although this is a very idealized situation, the resulting model
preserves the phenomenology of Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and, in some
situations, can be described as a perfect fluid, without introducing large
errors in both cosmological background and first-order perturbations. The
perfect fluid description of RRG model was already used to study the warmness
of dark matter, massive neutrinos and interaction of baryons and photons before
recombination, showing very good agreement with previous works based on the
full Einstein-Boltzmann system of equations. In order to understand these
results and construct a more general and formal framework for RRG, we develop a
theoretical description of first-order cosmological perturbations of RRG, based
on a distribution function which encodes the simplifying assumption that all
particles have the same momentum magnitude. The full set of Einstein-Boltzmann
equations for RRG distribution are derived and quantities beyond the perfect
fluid approximation are studied. Using RRG to describe warm dark matter, we
show that, for particles with $m \sim \text{keV}$, the perfect fluid
approximation is valid on scales $k < 10\, \text{h}/\text{Mpc}$, for most of
the universe evolution. We also determine initial conditions for RRG in the
early universe and study the evolution of potential in a toy model of universe
composed only by RRG.

  Van Douwen proved it is consistent for $\sigma$ and $\sigma^{-1}$ not to be

Douwen's result: while $\sigma$ and $\sigma^{-1}$ may not be isomorphic, there
is no simple topological property that distinguishes them.
  As a relatively straightforward consequence of the main theorem, we deduce
that $\mathsf{OCA}+\mathsf{MA}$ implies the set of continuous images of
$\sigma$ fails to be Borel in $\mathcal H(\omega^*)$. (Here a ``continuous

contents significantly above the equilibrium solubility of 1 at.%. These
defects can impact both the microstructure and charge carrier lifetime. Herein,
to identify the vacancy-related complexes and probe their evolution as a
function of Sn content, depth-profiled pulsed low-energy positron annihilation
lifetime spectroscopy and Doppler broadening spectroscopy were combined to
investigate GeSn epitaxial layers with Sn content in the 6.5-13.0 at.% range.
The samples were grown by chemical vapor deposition method at temperatures
between 300 and 330 {\deg}C. Regardless of the Sn content, all GeSn samples
showed the same depth-dependent increase in the positron annihilation line
broadening parameters, which confirmed the presence of open volume defects. The
measured average positron lifetimes were the highest (380-395 ps) in the region
near the surface and monotonically decrease across the analyzed thickness, but
remain above 350 ps. All GeSn layers exhibit lifetimes that are 85 to 110 ps
higher than the Ge reference layers. Surprisingly, these lifetimes were found
to decrease as Sn content increases in GeSn layers. These measurements indicate
that divacancies are the dominant defect in the as-grown GeSn layers. However,
their corresponding lifetime was found to be shorter than in epitaxial Ge thus
suggesting that the presence of Sn may alter the structure of divacancies.
Additionally, GeSn layers were found to also contain a small fraction of
vacancy clusters, which become less important as Sn content increases.

stellar population in the spiral galaxy NGC 247. In particular, we focused our
attention in its hierarchical clustering distributions and the properties of
the smallest groups. We used multiband Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data from
three fields covering more than half of NGC 247 to select the young population.
Then, through the path linkage criterion (PLC), we found compact young star
groups, and estimated their fundamental parameters, such as their stellar
densities, sizes, amount of members and luminosity function (LF) slopes. We
also performed a fractal analysis to determinate the clustering properties of
this population. We build a stellar density map and the corresponding
dendrograms corresponding to the galactic young population to detect large
structures and draw their main characteristics. We detected 339 young star
groups, for which we computed a mean radius of $\sim$ 60 pc and a maximum in
the size distribution between 30 and 70 pc. We also obtained LF slopes with a
bimodal distribution showing peaks at $\sim$ 0.1 and $\sim$ 0.2. We identified
several candidates to HII regions which follow an excellent spatial correlation
with the young groups found by the PLC. We observed that the young population
are hierarchically organized, where the smaller and denser structures are
within larger and less dense ones. We noticed that all these groups presented a
fractal subclustering, following the hierarchical distribution observed in the
corresponding stellar density map. For the large young structures observed in
this map, we obtained a fractal dimension of $\sim$ 1.6-1.8 using the
perimeter-area relation and the cumulative size distribution. These values are
consistent with a scenario of hierarchical star formation.

consider perfect $K_r$-tilings in the setting of randomly perturbed graphs; a
model introduced by Bohman, Frieze and Martin where one starts with a dense

asymptotically almost surely, the resulting graph contains a perfect

random edges required `jumps' at regular intervals, and within these intervals
our result is best-possible. This work therefore closes the gap between the
seminal work of Johansson, Kahn and Vu (which resolves the purely random case,
i.e., $\alpha =0$) and that of Hajnal and Szemer\'edi (which demonstrates that
for $\alpha \geq 1-1/r$ the initial graph already houses the desired perfect

magnetic field is oriented in the $a$-$b$ plane. Moreover, the AMR for the

domains of the extra 5th dimension. Utilizing this setup, we attempt to solve
the fermion mass hierarchy problem of the SM. The mass hierarchy can be
naturally explained by suitably distributing the fermions in different
positions along the extra dimension. Due to these different localization
points, the effective 4D gauge couplings of Kaluza-Klein (KK) mode gauge bosons
to the SM fermions become non-universal. As a result, our model is severely
constrained by the Flavor Changing Neutral Current (FCNC) measurements. We find
two interesting cases in which our model is phenomenologically viable: (1) the
KK-mode of the SM gauge bosons are extremely heavy and unlikely to be produced
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), while future FCNC measurements can reveal
the existence of these heavy modes. (2) the width of the localized SM fermions
is very narrow, leading to almost universal 4D KK-mode gauge couplings. In this
case, the FCNC constraints can be easily avoided even if a KK gauge boson mass
lies at the TeV scale. Such a light KK gauge boson can be searched at the LHC
in the near future.

anomalous velocity associated with large Berry curvature at the topological

study models on context of Creation Cold Dark Matter (CCDM). From conditions on
the first ($\dot{S}\geq0$)\footnote{Throughout the present work we will use
dots to indicate time derivatives and dashes to indicate derivatives with
respect to scale factor.} and second order ($\ddot{S}<0$) time derivatives of
total entropy in the initial expansion of Sitter through the radiation and
matter eras until the end of Sitter expansion, it is possible to estimate the
intervals of parameters. The total entropy ($S_{t}$) is calculated as sum of
the entropy at all eras ($S_{\gamma}$ and $S_{m}$) plus the entropy of the
event horizon ($S_h$). This term derives from the Holographic Principle where
it suggests that all information is contained on the observable horizon. The
main feature of this method for these models are that thermodynamic equilibrium
is reached in a final de Sitter era. Total entropy of the universe is
calculated with three terms: apparent horizon ($S_{h}$), entropy of matter
($S_{m}$) and entropy of radiation ($S_{\gamma}$). This analysis allows to
estimate intervals of parameters of CCDM models.

entire making of music, from the score to the performance, connecting
compositional structures to acoustical reality of sounds. Moreover, the precise
concept of gesture has a decisive role in understanding musical performance. In
this paper, we apply some concepts of category theory to compare gestures of
orchestral musicians, and to investigate the relationship between orchestra and
conductor, as well as between listeners and conductor/orchestra. To this aim,
we will introduce the concept of gestural similarity. The mathematical tools
used can be applied to gesture classification, and to interdisciplinary

target recognition. Single-photon LiDAR (light detection and ranging) offers
single-photon sensitivity and picosecond timing resolution, which is desirable
for high-precision three-dimensional (3D) imaging over long distances. Despite
important progress, further extending the imaging range presents enormous
challenges because only weak echo photons return and are mixed with strong
noise. Herein, we tackled these challenges by constructing a high-efficiency,
low-noise confocal single-photon LiDAR system, and developing a
long-range-tailored computational algorithm that provides high photon
efficiency and super-resolution in the transverse domain. Using this technique,
we experimentally demonstrated active single-photon 3D-imaging at a distance of
up to 45 km in an urban environment, with a low return-signal level of $\sim$1
photon per pixel. Our system is feasible for imaging at a few hundreds of
kilometers by refining the setup, and thus represents a significant milestone
towards rapid, low-power, and high-resolution LiDAR over extra-long ranges.

problems of nonlinear science is proposed in this paper. The analytical
iteration formula of this method is derived first using a general form of first
order nonlinear differential equations, followed by straightforward
discretization using Chebyshev polynomials and collocation method. The
resulting numerical algorithm is very concise and easy to use, only involving
highly sparse matrix operations of addition and multiplication, and no
inversion of the Jacobian in nonlinear problems. Apart from the simple yet
efficient iteration formula, another extraordinary feature of LVIM is that in
each local domain, all the collocation nodes participate in the calculation
simultaneously, thus each local domain can be regarded as one node in
calculation through GPU acceleration and parallel processing. For illustration,
the proposed algorithm of LVIM is applied to various nonlinear problems
including Blasius equations in fluid mechanics, buckled bar equations in solid
mechanics, the Chandrasekhar equation in astrophysics, the low-Earth-orbit
equation in orbital mechanics, etc. Using the built-in highly optimized ode45
function of MATLAB as a comparison, it is found that the LVIM is not only very
accurate, but also much faster by an order of magnitude than ode45 in all the
numerical examples, especially when the nonlinear terms are very complicated

solution $v(x,t)$ to the NSP has the property $v(x,0)=0$. This paradox shows
that the NSP is not a correct description of the fluid mechanics problem and it
proves that the NSP does not have a solution.

due to absence of user's past preferences for these items. The user
personalized non-collaborative methods based on item features can be used to
address this item cold-start problem. These methods rely on similarities
between the target item and user's previous preferred items. While computing
similarities based on item features, these methods overlook the interactions
among the features of the items and consider them independently. Modeling
interactions among features can be helpful as some features, when considered
together, provide a stronger signal on the relevance of an item when compared
to case where features are considered independently. To address this important
issue, in this work we introduce the Feature-based factorized Bilinear
Similarity Model (FBSM), which learns factorized bilinear similarity model for
TOP-n recommendation of new items, given the information about items preferred
by users in past as well as the features of these items. We carry out extensive
empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets, and we find that the proposed FBSM
approach improves upon traditional non-collaborative methods in terms of
recommendation performance. Moreover, the proposed approach also learns
insightful interactions among item features from data, which lead to deep
understanding on how these interactions contribute to personalized
recommendation.

complex interactions among vehicles. In order to get a precise detection and
tracking result, in this work we propose a novel tracking-by-detection

deal with serious occlusions. In the tracking stage, we model group behavior to
treat complex interactions with overlaps and ambiguities. The main
contributions of this paper are twofold: 1) Shape prior is exploited in the
sequential detection model to tackle occlusions in crowded scene. 2) Traffic
force is defined in the traffic scene to model group behavior, and it can
assist to handle complex interactions among vehicles. We evaluate the proposed
approach on real surveillance videos at road junctions and the performance has

individual items. An additional source of preference information is to use the
ratings that users provide on sets of items. The advantages of using
preferences on sets are two-fold. First, a rating provided on a set conveys
some preference information about each of the set's items, which allows us to
acquire a user's preferences for more items that the number of ratings that the
user provided. Second, due to privacy concerns, users may not be willing to
reveal their preferences on individual items explicitly but may be willing to
provide a single rating to a set of items, since it provides some level of
information hiding. This paper investigates two questions related to using
set-level ratings in recommender systems. First, how users' item-level ratings
relate to their set-level ratings. Second, how collaborative filtering-based
models for item-level rating prediction can take advantage of such set-level
ratings. We have collected set-level ratings from active users of Movielens on
sets of movies that they have rated in the past. Our analysis of these ratings
shows that though the majority of the users provide the average of the ratings
on a set's constituent items as the rating on the set, there exists a
significant number of users that tend to consistently either under- or
over-rate the sets. We have developed collaborative filtering-based methods to
explicitly model these user behaviors that can be used to recommend items to
users. Experiments on real data and on synthetic data that resembles the under-
or over-rating behavior in the real data, demonstrate that these models can
recover the overall characteristics of the underlying data and predict the
user's ratings on individual items.

paradigm of machine learning training methodology. As a result, we propose a
novel model training paradigm based on blockchain, named Galaxy Learning, which
aims to train a model with distributed data and to reserve the data ownership
for their owners. In this new paradigm, encrypted models are moved around
instead, and are federated once trained. Model training, as well as the
communication, is achieved with blockchain and its smart contracts. Pricing of
training data is determined by its contribution, and therefore it is not about
the exchange of data ownership. In this position paper, we describe the
motivation, paradigm, design, and challenges as well as opportunities of Galaxy

former often performs better, but is too slow for practical use. In this work,
