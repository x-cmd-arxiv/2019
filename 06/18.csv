visibilities with a chosen gridding function is necessary to transform
visibility values into uniformly sampled grid points. We propose here a
parameterised family of ""least-misfit gridding functions"" which minimise an
upper bound on the difference between the DFT and FFT dirty images for a given
gridding support width and image cropping ratio. When compared with the widely
used spheroidal function with similar parameters, these provide more than 100
times better alias suppression and RMS misfit reduction over the usable dirty
map. We discuss how appropriate parameter selection and tabulation of these
functions allow for a balance between accuracy, computational cost and storage
size. Although it is possible to reduce the errors introduced in the gridding
or degridding process to the level of machine precision, accuracy comparable to
that achieved by CASA requires only a lookup table with 300 entries and a
support width of 3, allowing for a greatly reduced computation cost for a given
performance.

anharmonic effects in crystals, but should be recognized as an important effect
separate from ""true"" anharmonicity. The original and widely used meaning of QH
theory is to put T=0 volume-dependent harmonic phonon energies omega_Q(V) into
the non-interacting phonon free energy. This paper uses that meaning, but
extends it to include the use of T=0 V-dependent single-particle electron
energies epsilon_K(V). It is demonstrated that the ""bare"" quasiparticle (QP)
energies omega_Q(V) and epsilon_K(V) correctly give the first-order term in the
V-dependence of the Helmholtz free energy F(V,T). Therefore, they give the
leading order result for thermal expansion alpha(T) and for the
temperature-dependence of the bulk modulus B(T)-B_0. However, neglected
interactions which shift and broaden omega_Q with T, also shift the free
energy. In metals, the low T electron-phonon mass enhancement of states near
the Fermi level causes a shift in free energy that is similar in size to the
electronic QH term. Before T reaches the Debye temperature, the mass
renormalization essentially disappears, and remaining electron-phonon shifts of
free energy contribute only higher-order terms to thermal expansion. Similarly,
anharmonic phonon-phonon interactions shift the free energy, but contribute to
thermal expansion only in higher order. Explicit next order formulas are given
for thermal expansion, which relate ""true"" anharmonic and similar free energy
corrections to quasiparticle self-energy shifts. The text below, except for

semantic relaxation of concurrent data structures for improving scalability and
performance. By relaxing the semantics of a data structure, a bigger design
space, that allows weaker synchronization and more useful parallelism, is
unveiled. Investigating new data structure designs, capable of trading
semantics for achieving better performance in a monotonic way, is a major
challenge in the area. We algorithmically address this challenge in this
paper.To address this challenge, we present an efficient lock-free, concurrent
data structure design framework for out-of-order semantic relaxation. Our
framework introduces a new two dimensional algorithmic design, that uses
multiple instances of an implementation of the given data structure. The first
dimension of our design is the number of data structure instances onto which
operations are spread to, in order to achieve increased parallelism through
disjoint memory accesses. The second dimension is the number of consecutive
operations of a single thread that can stay at the same data structure instance
in order to benefit from data locality. Our design can flexibly explore this
two-dimensional space to achieve the property of monotonically increasing
throughput performance via relaxing concurrent data structure semantics within
a tight deterministic relaxation bound, as we prove in the paper. We show how
our framework can instantiate lock-free out-of-order queues, stacks, counters
and dequeues. The experimental evaluation shows that our two-dimensional data
structures: i) significantly outperform the respected previous proposed ones
with respect to scalability and throughput performance and ii) monotonically
increase throughput as relaxation increases.

combines a retrieval model and a meta-learner, where the former learns to find
similar datapoints from the training data, and the latter considers retrieved
datapoints as a pseudo task for fast adaptation. Specifically, our retriever is
a context-aware encoder-decoder model with a latent variable which takes
context environment into consideration, and our meta-learner learns to utilize
retrieved datapoints in a model-agnostic meta-learning paradigm for fast
adaptation. We conduct experiments on CONCODE and CSQA datasets, where the
context refers to class environment in JAVA codes and conversational history,
respectively. We use sequence-to-action model as the base semantic parser,
which performs the state-of-the-art accuracy on both datasets. Results show
that both the context-aware retriever and the meta-learning strategy improve
accuracy, and our approach performs better than retrieve-and-edit baselines.

of the ionosphere rises in altitude. Observational studies of this type,
however, have been extremely limited. Using 13 years of ionospheric peak
altitude data from the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere
Sounding (MARSIS) instrument on Mars Express, we study how the peak altitude
responded to dust storms during six different Mars Years (MY). The peak
altitude increased $\sim$10-15 km during all six events, which include a local
dust storm (MY 33), three regional regional dust storms (MYs 27, 29, and 32),
and two global dust storms (MYs 28 and 34). The peak altitude's orbit-to-orbit
variability was exceptionally large at the apexes of the MY 29 and MY 32 dust
seasons, and dramatically increased during the MY 28 and MY 34 global dust
storms. We conclude that dust storms significantly increase upper atmospheric
variability, which suggests that they enhance dynamical processes that couple
the lower and upper atmospheres, such as upward propagating gravity waves or
atmospheric tides.

nonlinear spectroscopy schemes in the XUV energy range, yielding unprecedented
spatial and temporal resolution. However, their implementation has been
hampered by the experimental challenge of generating XUV pulse sequences with
precisely controlled timing and phase properties. In particular, direct control
and manipulation of the phase of individual pulses within a XUV pulse sequence
opens exciting possibilities for coherent control and multidimensional
spectroscopy, but has not been accomplished. Here, we overcome these
constraints in a highly time-stabilized and phase-modulated XUV-pump, XUV-probe

direct pulse manipulation, opens up extensive applications of advanced

Hamiltonian. When the Hamiltonian varies with time, the simulation complexity
should only depend on this quantity instantaneously. We develop quantum
simulation algorithms that exploit this intuition. For sparse Hamiltonian
simulation, the gate complexity scales with the $L^1$ norm
$\int_{0}^{t}\mathrm{d}\tau\left\lVert H(\tau)\right\lVert_{\max}$, whereas the
best previous results scale with $t\max_{\tau\in[0,t]}\left\lVert

improvement over previous simulation algorithms that can be substantial when
the Hamiltonian varies significantly. We introduce two new techniques: a
classical sampler of time-dependent Hamiltonians and a rescaling principle for
the Schr\""{o}dinger equation. The rescaled Dyson-series algorithm is nearly
optimal with respect to all parameters of interest, whereas the sampling-based
approach is easier to realize for near-term simulation. These algorithms could

between the two mediums helps to operate in a regime with capillary number $Ca$

surrounding oil viscosity $\mu_o$, the droplet velocity $U_d$ and surface

velocity is not influenced by the thickness of the thin lubricating film and
the dynamic meniscus. For iso-viscous cases, experimental and three-dimensional

Bayesian inference w.r.t. perturbations of the prior measure and the
log-likelihood function. This extends the well-posedness analysis of Bayesian
inverse problems. In particular, we prove a general local Lipschitz continuous
dependence of the posterior on the prior and the log-likelihood w.r.t. various
common distances of probability measures. These include the total variation,
Hellinger, and Wasserstein distance and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We
only assume the boundedness of the likelihoods and measure their perturbations
in an $L^p$-norm w.r.t. the prior. The obtained stability yields under mild
assumptions the well-posedness of Bayesian inverse problems, in particular, a
well-posedness w.r.t. the Wasserstein distance. Moreover, our results indicate
an increasing sensitivity of Bayesian inference as the posterior becomes more
concentrated, e.g., due to more or more accurate data. This confirms and
extends previous observations made in the sensitivity analysis of Bayesian

one-sided Green's function (Green's function for short). Combining the above
results, the elements of the foregoing notions are endowed with compact

We show that the elements of the fundamental solution set can be expressed in
terms of the first banded Hessenbergian fundamental solution, called principal
determinant function. We also show that the Green's function coincides with the

show that in the multi-hop HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018) dataset, the examples
often contain reasoning shortcuts through which models can directly locate the
answer by word-matching the question with a sentence in the context. We
demonstrate this issue by constructing adversarial documents that create
contradicting answers to the shortcut but do not affect the validity of the
original answer. The performance of strong baseline models drops significantly
on our adversarial evaluation, indicating that they are indeed exploiting the
shortcuts rather than performing multi-hop reasoning. After adversarial
training, the baseline's performance improves but is still limited on the
adversarial evaluation. Hence, we use a control unit that dynamically attends
to the question at different reasoning hops to guide the model's multi-hop
reasoning. We show that this 2-hop model trained on the regular data is more
robust to the adversaries than the baseline model. After adversarial training,
this 2-hop model not only achieves improvements over its counterpart trained on
regular data, but also outperforms the adversarially-trained 1-hop baseline. We
hope that these insights and initial improvements will motivate the development
of new models that combine explicit compositional reasoning with adversarial

sufficiently large cosmological perturbations re-entering the horizon when the
Universe is still radiation dominated. These originate from the spectrum of
curvature perturbations generated during inflation at small-scales. Because of
the non-linear relation between the curvature perturbation $\zeta$ and the
overdensity $\delta\rho$, the formation of the primordial black holes is
affected by intrinsic non-Gaussianity even though the curvature perturbation is
Gaussian. We investigate the impact of this non-Gaussianity on the critical
threshold $\delta_c$ which measures the excess of mass of the perturbation,
finding a relative change with respect to the value obtained using a linear
relation between $\zeta$ and $\delta\rho$, of a few percent. This shows that

effects, that inferring the correct causal relationship requires extra
covariates are included or ``adjusted for''. Without performing this adjustment
erroneous causal effects can be inferred. Given this phenomenon it is common
practice to include as many covariates as possible, however such advice comes
unstuck in the presence of M-bias. M-Bias is a problem in causal inference
where the correct estimation of treatment effects requires that certain
variables are not adjusted for i.e. are simply neglected from inclusion in the
model. This issue caused a storm of controversy in 2009 when Rubin, Pearl and
others disagreed about if it could be problematic to include additional
variables in models when inferring causal effects. This paper makes two
contributions to this issue. Firstly we provide a Bayesian solution to the
M-Bias problem. The solution replicates Pearl's solution, but consistent with
Rubin's advice we condition on all variables. Secondly the fact that we are
able to offer a solution to this problem in Bayesian terms shows that it is
indeed possible to represent causal relationships within the Bayesian paradigm,
albeit in an extended space. We make several remarks on the similarities and
differences between causal graphical models which implement the do-calculus and
probabilistic graphical models which enable Bayesian statistics. We hope this
work will stimulate more research on unifying Pearl's causal calculus using
causal graphical models with traditional Bayesian statistics and probabilistic
graphical models.

active comet. The comet is associated with the Phoenicids, an otherwise minor
meteor shower that produced significant outbursts in 1956 and 2014. The shower
points to the existence of significant mass-loss events of P/Blanpain in recent
history. P/Blanpain was recovered during an apparent large outburst in 2013
July at an appreciable heliocentric distance of 3.9 au, with brightness
increase of 9 mag, making it one of the largest comet outbursts ever observed.
Here we present an analysis of archival data taken by several telescopes. We
find that the 2013 outburst has produced $\sim10^{8}$ kg of dust, which
accounts for a modest fraction ($\sim1\%$) of the mass of P/Blanpain's nucleus
as measured in 2004. Based on analysis of long-term lightcurve and modeling of
coma morphology, we conclude that the 2013 outburst was most likely driven by
the crystallization of amorphous water ice triggered by a spin-up disruption of
the nucleus. Dust dynamical model shows that a small fraction of the dust
ejecta will reach the Earth in 2036 and 2041, but are only expected to produce
minor enhancements to the Phoenicid meteor shower. The 2013 outburst of
P/Blanpain, though remarkable for a comet at small sizes, does not necessary

In associate with flat-band induced by destructive interference and Dirac

step towards comprehending kagome physics and achieving novel quantum phases.
Here, combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, transport
measurements and first-principle calculations, we expose a planar flat-band in
paramagnetic YCr6Ge6 as a typical signature of electronic kagome lattice. We
unearth that the planar flat-band arises from the d_(z^2 ) electrons with
intra-kagome-plane hopping forbidden by destructive interference. On the other
hand, the destructive interference and flatness of the d_(x^2-y^2 ) and d_xy
bands are decomposed possibly due to additional in-plane hopping terms, but the
Dirac cone-type dispersion is reserved near chemical potential. We explicitly
unveil that orbital character plays an essential role to realize electronic
kagome lattice in bulk materials with transition metal kagome layers.
Paramagnetic YCr6Ge6 provides an opportunity to comprehend intrinsic properties
of electronic kagome lattice as well as its interplays with spin orbit coupling
and electronic correlation of Cr-3d electrons, and be free from complications
induced by strong local moment of ions in kagome planes.

energy from the largest to the smallest scales of the flow. While the dominant
idea is that the cascade occurs through the physical process of vortex
stretching, evidence for this is debated. In the framework of the
Karman-Howarth equation for the two point turbulent kinetic energy, we derive a
new result for the average flux of kinetic energy between two points in the
flow that reveals the role of vortex stretching. However, the result shows that
vortex stretching is in fact not the main contributor to the average energy
cascade; the main contributor is the self-amplification of the strain-rate
field. We emphasize the need to correctly distinguish and not conflate the
roles of vortex stretching and strain-self amplification in order to correctly
understand the physics of the cascade, and also resolve a paradox regarding the
differing role of vortex stretching on the mechanisms of the energy cascade and
energy dissipation rate. Direct numerical simulations are used to confirm the
results, as well as provide further results and insights on vortex stretching
and strain-self amplification at different scales in the flow. Interestingly,
the results imply that while vortex stretching plays a sub-leading role in the
average cascade, it may play a leading order role during large fluctuations of
the energy cascade about its average behavior.

processes, on both the micro- and macro-scales, whereby clouds are formed and
behave. However, exactly how these are linked together and how turbulence
impacts each of these processes is not yet fully understood. This is partly due
to a lack of in-situ small scale fluctuation measurements due to a limitation
in the available technology. It is in this context that the radiosondes, for
which the material characterisation is presented in this paper, are being
developed to generate a Lagrangian set of data which can be used to improve the
ever-expanding knowledge of atmospheric processes and, in particular, the
understanding of the interaction between turbulence and micro-physical
phenomenologies inside clouds (www.complete-h2020network.eu). Specifically, the
materials developed for the balloons are discussed in further detail within
this paper. Mater Bi and polylactic acid are the two common biodegradable
thermoplastics that were used initially to make the balloons. To tailor their
properties, the balloons were then coated with carnauba wax blended with either
pine resin or SiO_2 nanoparticles. The properties such as hydrophobicity,
toughness, elasticity and helium gas permeability are investigated and improved
in order to keep the density of the radiosondes as constant as possible for a
couple of hours. This will allow them to float inside and outside clouds on an
isopycnic surface, to measure various properties such as velocity, temperature,
pressure and humidity by means of solid state sensors and to transmit them to
receivers on Earth. Tests have been made under a rigorous metrological approach
comparing the 6 new materials with two reference balloon materials, latex and
mylar. It was found that Mater Bi with the two carnaubua wax coatings is the
most suited..

lowest energy bands of twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) can be made flat. The
flat nature of the bands favors the formation of collective ground states and,
in particular, TBLG has been shown to support superconductivity. When the
energy bands participating in the superconductivity are well-isolated, the
superfluid weight scales inversely with the effective mass of such bands. For
flat-band systems one would therefore conclude that even if superconducting
pairing is present most of the signatures of the superconducting state should
be absent. This conclusion is at odds with the experimental observations for
TBLG. We calculate the superfluid weight for TBLG taking into account both the
conventional contribution and the contribution arising from the quantum
geometry of the bands. We find that both contributions are larger than one
would expect treating the bands as well-isolated, that at the magic angle the
geometric contribution is larger than the conventional one, and that for small
deviations away from the magic angle the conventional contribution is larger
than the geometric one. Our results show that, despite the flatness of the
bands the superfluid weight in TBLG is finite and consistent with experimental
observations. We also show how the superfluid weight can be tuned by varying
the chemical potential and the twist angle opening the possibility to tune the
nature of the superconducting transition between the standard BCS transition
and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.

originated from confined regions of their magnetospheres. A potential presence
of magnetospherically originated emission outside this region, the so-called
off-pulse emission, would challenge the existing theories. Detection of
significant off-pulse emission has been reported so far from only two pulsars,
B0525+21 and B2045-16, at 325 and 610 MHz. However, the nature of this newly
uncovered off-pulse emission remains unclear. To probe its origin we conducted
very high resolution radio observations of B0525+21 and B2045-16 with the
European VLBI Network (EVN) at 1.39 GHz. Whereas the pulsed emission is
detected at a level consistent with previous observations, we report absence of
any off-pulse emission above $42$ and $96\ \mathrm{\mu Jy\ beam^{-1}}$ (three
times the rms noise levels) for B0525+21 and B2045-16, respectively. Our
stringent upper limits imply the off-pulse emission to be less than $0.4$ and
$0.3\%$ of the period-averaged pulsed flux density, i.e., much fainter than the
previously suggested values of $1$-$10\%$. Since the EVN data are most
sensitive to extremely compact angular scales, our results suggest a
non-magnetospheric origin for the previously reported off-pulse emission.
Presence of extended emission that is resolved out on these milliarcsecond
scales still remains plausible. In this case, we constrain the emission to
arise from structures with sizes of $\sim (0.61$-$19) \times 10^3\ \mathrm{au}$
for B0525+21 and $\sim (0.48$-$8.3) \times 10^3\ \mathrm{au}$ for B2045-16.
These constraints might indicate that the two pulsars are accompanied by
compact bow-shock pulsar wind nebulae. Future observations probing intermediate
angular scales ($\sim 0.1$-$5\ \mathrm{arcsec}$) will help in clarifying the
actual origin of the off-pulse emission.

detection and node representation learning, which capture the global and local

are usually independently studied while they are actually highly correlated. We
propose a probabilistic generative model called vGraph to learn community
membership and node representation collaboratively. Specifically, we assume
that each node can be represented as a mixture of communities, and each
community is defined as a multinomial distribution over nodes. Both the mixing
coefficients and the community distribution are parameterized by the
low-dimensional representations of the nodes and communities. We designed an
effective variational inference algorithm which regularizes the community
membership of neighboring nodes to be similar in the latent space. Experimental
results on multiple real-world graphs show that vGraph is very effective in
both community detection and node representation learning, outperforming many
competitive baselines in both tasks. We show that the framework of vGraph is
quite flexible and can be easily extended to detect hierarchical communities.

complex data structures into a simpler, more uniform format. We show that this
leads to improved performance over similar methods that do not use execution

feasible from static code alone. As an illustration of this, we apply the new
model to challenging dynamic tasks (branch prediction and prefetching) from the

demonstrate transfer learning with high performance on an indirectly related

attentional control deficits which align with many symptoms outlined on

probe the 3D geometry of core collapse supernovae (CCSNe). The number of
high-quality multi-epoch spectropolarimetric data sets for CCSNe remains quite
low, however, due to the challenging nature of such observations. In this
Thesis we present and analyse the data of two Type IIb SNe (SN 2008aq - two
epochs, SN 2011hs - seven epochs) and one Type Ic-bl (SN 2014ad - seven
epochs). The latter is the most complete spectropolarimetric data set for a
Type Ic-bl to date. We also provide a preliminary re-analysis of the
spectropolarimetric data of SN 1993J. The new datasets demonstrate that the
spectropolarimetry of stripped envelope supernovae is complex and varied, and
although early studies of type IIb SNe showed similar behaviour to type IIP, it
is now clear that this early trend is broken by a growing sample of SNe.
Additionally, we identified potential signatures of a jet in SN 2014ad.
Furthermore, a toy model to simulate spectropolarimetry from simple geometries
(similar to Reilly et al. 2016) was created. A systematic approach to parameter
space exploration was developped; this showed that unfortunately these models
suffer extreme degeneracies and may not lead to accurate interpretations.
Finally, spectropolarimetry can also be used to probe asymmetries caused by
fast rotation in the potential progenitors of stripped envelope CCSNe. Although
numerous Wolf-Rayet stars of type WN and WC have been observed with
spectropolarimetry, no single WO stars have been studied to date. In our data
of two Galactic WO stars, we found no line effect and could not sufficiently
constrain the rotational velocity to exclude a collapsar scenario. Therefore,
the absence of a line effect may not necessarily equate to a low rotational
velocity.

non-Abelian parafermion zero modes in domain walls on interfaces between two
dimensional Abelian topological phases of matter, we investigate the properties
of gapped interfaces of hierarchical fractional quantum Hall states, in the
lowest Landau level, characterized by the Hall conductance $\sigma_{xy}(m,p) =
\frac{p}{2mp+1} \frac{e^{2}}{h}$, for integer numbers $(m,p)$ with $m,p \geq

of fractional quantum Hall states with $\sigma_{xy} =
\frac{1}{3}\frac{e^{2}}{h}, \frac{2}{5}\frac{e^{2}}{h},
\frac{3}{7}\frac{e^{2}}{h}, ...\, $, which has been observed in many two
dimensional electron gases. Exploring the mechanism by which the $(m,p+1)$
hierarchical state is generated from the condensation of quasiparticles of the
``parent"" state $(m,p)$, we uncover a remarkably rich sequence of parafermions
in hierarchical interfaces whose quantum dimension $d_{m,p}$ depends both upon
the total quantum dimension $\mathcal{D}_{m,p} = \sqrt{2mp+1}$ of the bulk
Abelian phase, as well as on the parity of the ``hierarchy level"" $p$, which we
associate with the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ stability of Majorana zero modes in one
dimensional topological superconductors. We show that these parafermions reside
on domain walls separating segments of the interface where the low energy modes
are gapped by two distinct mechanisms: (1) a charge neutral backscattering
process or (2) an interaction that breaks $U(1)$ charge conservation symmetry
and stabilizes a condensate whose charge depends on $p$. Remarkably, this
charge condensate corresponds to a clustering of quasiparticles of fractional
charge $\frac{p}{2mp+1}\,e$, allowing us to draw a correspondence between these
fractionalized condensates and Read-Rezayi non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall

the dynamical evolution of merging binary black holes (BBHs) in dense stellar
clusters. Recent studies indicate that dense clusters are likely to
significantly contribute to the rate of merging BBHs observable through
gravitational waves (GWs), and that many of these mergers will appear with
notable eccentricities measurable in the LISA and LIGO sensitivity bands. This
is highly interesting, as eccentricity can be used to distinguish between
different astrophysical merger channels. However, all of these recent studies
are based on various Monte Carlo (MC) techniques that only include strong
interactions for the dynamical evolution of BBHs, whereas any binary generally
undergoes orders-of-magnitude more weak interactions than strong. It is well
known that weak interactions primarily lead to a change in the binary's
eccentricity, which for BBHs implies that weak interactions can change their GW
inspiral time and thereby their merger probability. With this motivation, we
perform MC simulations of BBHs evolving in dense clusters under the influence
of both weak and strong interactions. We find that including weak interactions
leads to a notable increase in the number of BBHs that merge inside their
cluster, which correspondingly leads to a higher number of eccentric LISA
sources. These preliminary results illustrate the importance of including weak
interactions for accurately modeling how BBHs merge in clusters, and how to
link their emitted GW signals to their astrophysical environment.

dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood. For its late spectral type (M7.0V), the star
shows relatively little activity and is a prime target for near-infrared radial
velocity surveys such as CARMENES.
  Aims. As part of the CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs, we
obtained more than 200 radial-velocity measurements of Teegarden's Star and
analysed them for planetary signals.
  Methods. We find periodic variability in the radial velocities of Teegarden's
Star. We also studied photometric measurements to rule out stellar brightness
variations mimicking planetary signals.
  Results. We find evidence for two planet candidates, each with $1.1M_\oplus$
minimum mass, orbiting at periods of 4.91 and 11.4 d, respectively. No evidence
for planetary transits could be found in archival and follow-up photometry.
Small photometric variability is suggestive of slow rotation and old age.
  Conclusions. The two planets are among the lowest-mass planets discovered so
far, and they are the first Earth-mass planets around an ultra-cool dwarf for
which the masses have been determined using radial velocities.

imaging. The four Ly$\alpha$ halos presented here are diverse in morphology and
size, they each display spatial asymmetry, and none are centred on the position
of the quasar. Spectra of the diffuse halos demonstrate that none are
dramatically offset in velocity from the systemic redshift of the quasars
($\Delta$ v $< 200$ kms$^{-1}$), however each halo shows a broad Ly$\alpha$
line, with a velocity width of order $\sim1000$ kms$^{-1}$. Total Ly$\alpha$

luminosities than previous literature results at this redshift, but find no
correlation between the quasar properties and the Ly$\alpha$ halo, suggesting
that the detected emission is most closely related to the physical properties

hydrodynamic (HD) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of astrophysical
flows. The standard CR two-fluid model is described in terms of three
conservation laws (expressing conservation of mass, momentum and total energy)
and one additional equation (for the CR pressure) that cannot be cast in a
satisfactory conservative form. The presence of non-conservative terms with
spatial derivatives in the model equations prevents a unique weak solution
behind a shock. We investigate a number of methods for the numerical solution
of the two-fluid equations and find that, in the presence of shock waves, the
results generally depend on the numerical details (spatial reconstruction, time
stepping, the CFL number, and the adopted discretization). All methods converge
to a unique result if the energy partition between the thermal and non-thermal
fluids at the shock is prescribed using a subgrid prescription. This highlights
the non-uniqueness problem of the two-fluid equations at shocks. From our
numerical investigations, we report a robust method for which the solutions are
insensitive to the numerical details even in absence of a subgrid prescription,
although we recommend a subgrid closure at shocks using results from kinetic
theory. The subgrid closure is crucial for a reliable post-shock solution and
also its impact on large scale flows because the shock microphysics that
determines CR acceleration is not accurately captured in a fluid approximation.
Critical test problems, limitations of fluid modeling, and future directions
are discussed.

geometric understanding of the bootstrap equations for unitary theories leads
to cyclic polytopes for which the faces can all be written down and, in
principle, the intersection between the unitarity polytope and the crossing
plane can be systematically explored. We find that in higher dimensions, the
natural structure that emerges, due to the inclusion of spin, is the weighted
Minkowski sum of cyclic polytopes. While it can be explicitly shown that for
physical theories, the weighted Minkowski sum of cyclic polytopes is not a
cyclic polytope, it also turns out that in the large conformal dimension limit
it is indeed a cyclic polytope. We write down several analytic formulae in this
limit and show that remarkably, in many cases, this works out to be very good
approximation even for $O(1)$ conformal dimensions. Furthermore, we initiate a

by $\sim$91 days, were detected in the $BVI$ bands. The shapes and amplitudes
of the outbursts reveal the nature of KSP-OT-201611a to be an SU UMa- or U
Gem-type dwarf nova. Color variations of periodic humps in the super/long

during the outbursts due most likely to the difference of time when the cooling
wave is formed in the accretion disk. The outburst peak magnitudes and the
orbital period of the dwarf nova indicate that it is at a large Galactocentric

visual navigation through learning an agent that is guided by conceiving the
next observations it expects to see. This is achieved by learning a variational
Bayesian model, called NeoNav, which generates the next expected observations
(NEO) conditioned on the current observations of the agent and the target view.
Our generative model is learned through optimizing a variational objective
encompassing two key designs. First, the latent distribution is conditioned on
current observations and the target view, leading to a model-based,
target-driven navigation. Second, the latent space is modeled with a Mixture of
Gaussians conditioned on the current observation and the next best action. Our
use of mixture-of-posteriors prior effectively alleviates the issue of
over-regularized latent space, thus significantly boosting the model
generalization for new targets and in novel scenes. Moreover, the NEO
generation models the forward dynamics of agent-environment interaction, which
improves the quality of approximate inference and hence benefits data
efficiency. We have conducted extensive evaluations on both real-world and
synthetic benchmarks, and show that our model consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art models in terms of success rate, data efficiency, and
generalization.

the level of model predictions for neutrino fluences at these energies from
several types of long-duration astrophysical transients (e.g., binary neutron

adolescence is the crucial developmental epoch of continued brain growth and
change. A large number of researchers dedicate to uncovering the mechanisms
about brain maturity during adolescence. Motivated by both achievement in graph
signal processing and recent evidence that some brain areas act as hubs
connecting functionally specialized systems, we proposed an approach to detect
these regions from spectral analysis perspective. In particular, as human brain
undergoes substantial development throughout adolescence, we addressed the
challenge by evaluating the functional network difference among age groups from
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) observations. Methods: We treated
these observations as graph signals defined on the parcellated functional brain
regions and applied graph Laplacian learning based Fourier Transform (GLFT) to
transform the original graph signals into frequency domain. Eigen-analysis was
conducted afterwards to study the behavior of the corresponding brain regions,
which enables the characterization of brain maturation. Result: We first
evaluated our method on the synthetic data and further applied the method to
resting and task state fMRI imaging data from Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental

and 3 values of $M_\pi \sim 135, 225$ and 315 MeV. High-statistics estimates
are used to perform a simultaneous extrapolation in the lattice spacing,
lattice volume and light-quark masses. The $Q^2$ dependence over the range
0.05-1.4 ${\rm GeV}^2$ is investigated using both the $z$-expansion and the
dipole form. Final $z$-expansion estimates for the isovector r.m.s. radius are
$r_E = 0.769(27)(30)$ fm $r_M = 0.671(48)(76)$ fm and $\mu^{p-n} =
3.939(86)(138)$ Bohr magneton. The first error is the combined uncertainty from
the leading-order analysis, and the second is an estimate of the additional
uncertainty due to using the leading order chiral-continuum-finite-volume fits.
The dipole estimates, $r_E = 0.765(11)(8)$ fm, $r_M = 0.704(21)(29)$ fm and
$\mu^{p-n} = 3.975(84)(125)$, are consistent with those from the $z$-expansion
but with smaller errors. Our analysis highlights three points. First, all data
from the eleven ensembles and existing lattice data on, or close to, physical
mass ensembles from other collaborations collapses more clearly onto a single
curve when plotted versus $Q^2/M_N^2$ as compared to $Q^2$ with the scale set
by quantities other than $M_N$. The difference between these two analyses is
indicative of discretization errors, some of which presumably cancel when the
data are plotted versus $Q^2/M_N^2$. Second, the size of the remaining
deviation of this common curve from the Kelly curve is small and can be
accounted for by statistical and possible systematic uncertainties. Third, to
improve lattice estimates, high statistics data for $Q^2 < 0.1$ ${\rm GeV}^2$
are needed.

the merging of convective Si-burning and C-burning shells in a 20 $M_\odot$

$^{51}$V and $^{52}$Cr, out to the edge of the carbon/oxygen (CO) core. The
adopted supernova model ejects the outer 2 $M_\odot$ of the CO core, which

  This paper proposes SafeP4, a domain-specific language for programmable data

semantics and a static type system that statically guarantees header
validity---a common source of safety bugs according to our analysis of
real-world P4 programs. Statically ensuring header validity is challenging
because the set of valid headers can be modified at runtime, making it a
dynamic program property. Our type system achieves static safety by using a
form of path-sensitive reasoning that tracks dynamic information from
conditional statements, routing tables, and the control plane. Our evaluation
shows that SafeP4's type system can effectively eliminate common failures in
many real-world programs.

runs counter to the scaling arguments commonly used to derive the entrainment
rate, which rely on either the self-similarity of \citet{scorer1957} or the
turbulent entrainment hypothesis of \citet{morton1956}. The assumption of
turbulence-driven entrainment was investigated by \citet{lecoanet2018}, who
found that the entrainment efficiency $e$ varies by less than $20\%$ between
laminar (Re = 630) and turbulent (Re = 6300) thermals. This motivated us to
utilize Turner's argument of buoyancy-controlled entrainment in addition to the
thermal's vertical momentum equation to build a model for thermal dynamics
which does not invoke turbulence or self-similarity. We derive simple
expressions for the thermals' kinematic properties and their fractional
entrainment rate $\epsilon$ and find close quantitative agreement with the
values in direct numerical simulations. In particular, our expression for
entrainment rate is consistent with the parameterization $\epsilon \sim B/w^2$,
for Archimedean buoyancy $B$ and vertical velocity $w$. We also directly
validate the role of buoyancy-driven entrainment by running simulations where
gravity is turned off midway through a thermal's rise. The entrainment
efficiency $e$ is observed to drop to less than 1/3 of its original value in
both the laminar and turbulent cases when $g=0$, affirming the central role of

representation of Sp(V). It is natural to ask how the tensor power
representation $\mu^{\otimes t}$ decomposes. If V is a real vector space, then
Howe-Kashiwara-Vergne (HKV) duality asserts that there is a one-one
correspondence between the irreducible subrepresentations of Sp(V) and the
irreps of an orthogonal group O(t). It is well-known that this duality fails
over finite fields. Addressing this situation, Gurevich and Howe have recently
assigned a notion of rank to each Sp(V) representation. They show that a
variant of HKV duality continues to hold over finite fields, if one restricts
attention to subrepresentations of maximal rank. The nature of the
rank-deficient components was left open. Here, we show that all rank-deficient
Sp(V)-subrepresentations arise from embeddings of lower-order tensor products
of $\mu$ and $\bar\mu$ into $\mu^{\otimes t}$. The embeddings live on spaces
that have been studied in quantum information theory as tensor powers of
self-orthogonal Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) quantum codes. We then find that
the irreducible Sp(V) subrepresentations of $\mu^{\otimes t}$ are labelled by
the irreps of orthogonal groups O(r) acting on certain r-dimensional spaces for
r <= t. The results hold in odd charachteristic and the ""stable range"" t <= 1/2

Anisotropic KPZ class: one has $\det [D^2 v_{\mathtt w}(\rho)]<0$ and the
height fluctuations grow at most logarithmically in time. Moreover, we prove
that $D v_{\mathtt w}(\rho)$ is discontinuous at each of the (finitely many)
smooth (or ""gaseous"") slopes $\rho$; at these slopes, fluctuations do not
diverge as time grows. For a special case of spatially $2-$periodic weights,
analogous results have been recently proven in Chhita-Toninelli (2018) via an
explicit computation of $v_{\mathtt w}(\rho)$. In the general case, such a
computation is out of reach; instead, our proof goes through a relation between
the speed of growth and the limit shape of domino tilings of the Aztec diamond.

speaker variation is achieved by applying adversarial training and FHVAE based
disentangled speech representation learning. A comparison of the two approaches

Experimental results on ZeroSpeech 2017 show that both approaches are effective

marginal improvement in across-speaker condition. Results on ZeroSpeech 2019
show that in the ABX discriminability task, our approaches significantly
outperform the official baseline, and are competitive to or even outperform the

group of agents performing the actions or having some interaction. Human
activity recognition has gained popularity due to its demands in many practical
applications such as entertainment, healthcare, simulations and surveillance
systems. Vision based activity recognition is gaining advantage as it does not
require any human intervention or physical contact with humans. Moreover, there
are set of cameras that are networked with the intention to track and recognize
the activities of the agent. Traditional applications that were required to
track or recognize human activities made use of wearable devices. However, such
applications require physical contact of the person. To overcome such
challenges, vision based activity recognition system can be used, which uses a
camera to record the video and a processor that performs the task of
recognition. The work is implemented in two stages. In the first stage, an
approach for the Implementation of Activity recognition is proposed using
background subtraction of images, followed by 3D- Convolutional Neural
Networks. The impact of using Background subtraction prior to 3D-Convolutional
Neural Networks has been reported. In the second stage, the work is further
extended and implemented on Raspberry Pi, that can be used to record a stream
of video, followed by recognizing the activity that was involved in the video.
Thus, a proof-of-concept for activity recognition using small, IoT based

challenging research topic for many applications such as smart photo editing,
movie making, virtual try-on, and fashion display. In this paper, we present a
novel deep generative model to transfer an image of a person from a given pose
to a new pose while keeping fashion item consistent. In order to formulate the
framework, we employ one generator and two discriminators for image synthesis.
The generator includes an image encoder, a pose encoder and a decoder. The two
encoders provide good representation of visual and geometrical context which
will be utilized by the decoder in order to generate a photorealistic image.
Unlike existing pose-guided image generation models, we exploit two
discriminators to guide the synthesis process where one discriminator
differentiates between generated image and real images (training samples), and
another discriminator verifies the consistency of appearance between a target
pose and a generated image. We perform end-to-end training of the network to
learn the parameters through back-propagation given ground-truth images. The
proposed generative model is capable of synthesizing a photorealistic image of
a person given a target pose. We have demonstrated our results by conducting
rigorous experiments on two data sets, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

likely to be found in indoor deployment scenarios where the TRPs are typically
equipped with only 2 transmit antenna ports, whereas benefits are less likely
to be observed in macro-cell deployments where TRPs typically have a larger

the relationship between multiple executions simultaneously in continuous time.
Examples include probabilistic fairness and sensitivity to modeling errors
(i.e., parameters changes) for real-valued signals. These requirements can only
be specified by hyperproperties. In this work, we focus on verifying
probabilistic hyperproperties for CPS. To cover a wide range of modeling
formalisms, we first propose a general model of probabilistic uncertain systems
(PUSs) that unify commonly studied CPS models such as continuous-time Markov
chains (CTMCs) and probabilistically parametrized Hybrid I/O Automata. To
formally specify hyperproperties, we propose a new temporal logic, hyper
probabilistic signal temporal logic (HyperPSTL) that serves as a hyper and
probabilistic version of the conventional signal temporal logic (STL).
Considering complexity of real-world systems that can be captured as PUSs, we
adopt a statistical model checking (SMC) approach for their verification. We
develop a new SMC technique based on the direct computation of the significance
levels of statistical assertions for HyperPSTL specifications, which requires
no a priori knowledge on the indifference margin. Then, we introduce SMC
algorithms for HyperPSTL specifications on the joint probabilistic distribution
of multiple paths, as well as specifications with nested probabilistic
operators quantifying different paths, which cannot be handled by existing SMC
algorithms. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our SMC algorithms on CPS
benchmarks with varying levels of complexity, including the Toyota Powertrain

such subjective evaluation task, namely that of estimating experienced emotions
of distressed individuals who are conversing with a human listener in an online
coaching platform. We explore strategies to aggregate the evaluators choices,
and show that a simple voting consensus is as effective as an optimum
aggregation method for the task considered. Intrigued by how an objective
assessment would compare to the subjective evaluation of evaluators, we also
designed a machine learning algorithm to perform the same task. Interestingly,
we observed a machine learning algorithm that is not explicitly modeled to
characterize evaluators' subjectivity is as reliable as the human evaluation in
terms of assessing the most dominant experienced emotions.

quasi-dimension term $D$ measures the quality of side information. In the
presence of vacuous side information, $D= m+n$. However, if the side
information is predictive of the underlying factorization of the matrix, then
in an ideal case, $D \in O(k + \ell)$ where $k$ is the number of distinct row

corresponding free energies, and combine the VISM with the string method to
obtain the minimum energy paths and transition states between the various
metastable ('dry' and 'wet') hydration states. The resulting dry-wet transition
rates are then used in a spatially-dependent multi-state continuous-time Markov
chain Brownian dynamics simulations, and the related Fokker-Planck equation
calculations, of the ligand stochastic motion, providing the mean first-passage
times for binding and unbinding. We find the hydration transitions to
significantly slow down the binding process, in semi-quantitative agreement
with existing explicit-water simulations, but significantly accelerate the
unbinding process. Moreover, our methods allow the characterization of
non-equilibrium hydration states of pocket and ligand during the ligand
movement, for which we find substantial memory and hysteresis effects for

are tightly clustered compared to standard outfits. Furthermore, outfits
produced by similar queries are close to one another, and outfits produced by
very different queries are far apart. Qualitative evaluation shows that our
method responds well to queries. A user study suggests that people understand

with a single vector. In this paper, we propose a Structured Distributional
Model (SDM) that combines word embeddings with formal semantics and is based on
the assumption that sentences represent events and situations. The semantic
representation of a sentence is a formal structure derived from Discourse
Representation Theory and containing distributional vectors. This structure is
dynamically and incrementally built by integrating knowledge about events and
their typical participants, as they are activated by lexical items. Event
knowledge is modeled as a graph extracted from parsed corpora and encoding
roles and relationships between participants that are represented as
distributional vectors. SDM is grounded on extensive psycholinguistic research
showing that generalized knowledge about events stored in semantic memory plays
a key role in sentence comprehension. We evaluate SDM on two recently
introduced compositionality datasets, and our results show that combining a
simple compositional model with event knowledge constantly improves
performances, even with different types of word embeddings.

designated a two-part"" source and target contexts"" to capture the targeting and
receptive fields of each RNA transcript, while encapsulating the heterogenous
cross-talk interactions between lncRNAs and miRNAs. From experimental results,
our method exhibits superior performance in AUPR rates compared to state-of-art

analyze three physical quantities for the two-walker case: The probability

visual servoing scheme is used to reduce the angular distance between the
center of the video frame of a robot camera and a target object. Additionally,
the beamforming strategy presented combines two information sources: the

signals provided by a microphone array. These sources of information were
integrated by making use of a weighted delay-and-sum beamforming method.

experiments with the reverb challenge are also reported. The results presented
here show that the combination of features can lead to WER improvements between
7% and 18% with speech recorded in real reverberant environments. Also, the
combination at DNN-output level is much more effective than at the
system-output level. However, cascading both schemes can still lead to smaller

this work, we approach the question of fundamental iteration complexity by
providing lower bounds to complement the linear (i.e. geometric) upper bounds
observed in the literature on a wide class of problems. We cast saddle-point
and min-max problems as 2-player games. We leverage tools from single-objective
convex optimisation to propose new linear lower bounds for convex-concave
games. Notably, we give a linear lower bound for $n$-player differentiable
games, by using the spectral properties of the update operator. We then propose
a new definition of the condition number arising from our lower bound analysis.
Unlike past definitions, our condition number captures the fact that linear
rates are possible in games, even in the absence of strong convexity or strong
concavity in the variables.

smaller nano-particles, functionalised polymers, and toxins. Equilibrium
multivalent binding is a continuous yet super-selective transition with respect
to the number of ligands and receptors involved in the interaction. Increasing
the ligand or receptor density on the two particles leads to sharp growth in
the number of bound particles at equilibrium.
  Here we present a theory and Monte Carlo simulations to show that applying
mechanical force to multivalent particles causes their adsorption/desorption

solvent around the particles, a magnetic field, chemical gradients, or
triggered uncoiling of inert oligomers/polymers tethered to the particles to
provide a steric repulsion to the surface. This physical principle is a step

to the current $I_S$ flowing in the superconducting contour may develop only in
geometrically asymmetric interferometers making their behavior qualitatively
different from that of symmetric devices. The current $I_N$ in the normal
contour -- along with $I_S$ -- is found to be sensitive to phase-coherent
effects thereby also acquiring a $2\pi$-periodic dependence on the Josephson
phase. In asymmetric structures this current develops an odd-in-phase
contribution originating from electron-hole asymmetry. We demonstrate that both

tuning the applied voltage, temperature and system topology, thus rendering
Andreev interferometers particularly important for future applications in

almost as natural as human speech. However, the bar of developing high-quality
TTS systems remains high since a sizable set of studio-quality <text, audio>
pairs is usually required. Compared to commercial data used to develop
state-of-the-art systems, publicly available data are usually worse in terms of
both quality and size. Audio generated by TTS systems trained on publicly
available data tends to not only sound less natural, but also exhibits more
background noise. In this work, we aim to lower TTS systems' reliance on
high-quality data by providing them the textual knowledge extracted by deep
pre-trained language models during training. In particular, we investigate the
use of BERT to assist the training of Tacotron-2, a state of the art TTS
consisting of an encoder and an attention-based decoder. BERT representations
learned from large amounts of unlabeled text data are shown to contain very
rich semantic and syntactic information about the input text, and have
potential to be leveraged by a TTS system to compensate the lack of
high-quality data. We incorporate BERT as a parallel branch to the Tacotron-2
encoder with its own attention head. For an input text, it is simultaneously
passed into BERT and the Tacotron-2 encoder. The representations extracted by
the two branches are concatenated and then fed to the decoder. As a preliminary
study, although we have not found incorporating BERT into Tacotron-2 generates
more natural or cleaner speech at a human-perceivable level, we observe
improvements in other aspects such as the model is being significantly better
at knowing when to stop decoding such that there is much less babbling at the
end of the synthesized audio and faster convergence during training.

fit the optical lightcurves, Fe II 5169\AA\ velocity, and photospheric
velocity, to the observational data. Recent research has suggested that the
progenitors of Type IIP SNe have a zero age main sequence (ZAMS) mass not
exceeding $\sim18$ M$_{\odot}$. Our fits give a progenitor ZAMS mass $\leq18$
M$_{\odot}$ for seven of the supernovae. Where previous progenitor mass
estimates exist, from various sources such as hydrodynamical modelling,
multi-wavelength observations, or semi-analytic calculations, our modelling
generally tends towards the lower mass values. This result is in contrast to
results from previous hydrodynamical modelling, but is consistent with those
obtained using general-relativistic radiation-hydrodynamical codes. We do find
that one event, SN 2015ba, has a progenitor whose mass is closer to 24
M$_{\odot}$ , although we are unable to fit it well. We also derive the amount
of $^{56}$Ni required to reproduce the tail of the lightcurve, and find values
generally larger than previous estimates. Overall, we find that it is difficult
to characterize the explosion by a single parameter, and that a range of
parameters is needed.

solely on the agent-specific reward is sub-optimal because it usually does not

shaping to construct a proxy reward by combining the individual rewards.
However, this requires manual tuning for each environment. We introduce
Multiagent Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (MERL), a split-level training

The gradient-based policies are periodically added to the evolutionary
population as a way of information transfer between the two optimization

the agent-specific rewards toward optimizing the global objective. Results
demonstrate that MERL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such

for anchor user sampling meets the challenges of non-i.i.d. user pair data
caused by network structures and the correlation among anchor or non-anchor
user pairs. To solve the challenges, DALAUP uses a couple of neural networks
with shared-parameter to obtain the vector representations of user pairs, and
ensembles three query strategies to select the most informative user pairs for
labeling and model training. Experiments on real-world social network data
demonstrate that DALAUP outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

photometry of the highly reddened, very nearby type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2014J

$B$-band maximum. SN 2014J is similar to other normal SNe Ia near the maximum
light, but it shows flux excess in the $B$ band in the early nebular phase.
This excess flux emission can be due to light scattering by some structures of
circumstellar materials located at a few 10$^{17}$ cm, consistent with a single
degenerate progenitor system or a double degenerate progenitor system with mass
outflows in the final evolution or magnetically driven winds around the binary
system. At t$\sim$+300 to $\sim$+500 days past the $B$-band maximum, the light
curve of SN 2014J shows a faster decline relative to the $^{56}$Ni decay. Such
a feature can be attributed to the significant weakening of the emission
features around [Fe III] $\lambda$4700 and [Fe II] $\lambda$5200 rather than
the positron escape as previously suggested. Analysis of the $HST$ images taken
at t$>$600 days confirms that the luminosity of SN 2014J maintains a flat
evolution at the very late phase. Fitting the late-time pseudo-bolometric light
curve with radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni, $^{57}$Ni and $^{55}$Fe isotopes, we
obtain the mass ratio $^{57}$Ni/$^{56}$Ni as $0.035 \pm 0.011$, which is
consistent with the corresponding value predicted from the 2D and 3D
delayed-detonation models. Combined with early-time analysis, we propose that
delayed-detonation through single degenerate scenario is most likely favored
for SN 2014J.

  (Oakland'20)",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hybrid testing combines fuzz testing and concolic execution. It leverages
fuzz testing to test easy-to-reach code regions and uses concolic execution to
explore code blocks guarded by complex branch conditions. However, its code
coverage-centric design is inefficient in vulnerability detection. First, it
blindly selects seeds for concolic execution and aims to explore new code
continuously. However, as statistics show, a large portion of the explored code
is often bug-free. Therefore, giving equal attention to every part of the code
during hybrid testing is a non-optimal strategy. It slows down the detection of
real vulnerabilities by over 43%. Second, classic hybrid testing quickly moves
on after reaching a chunk of code, rather than examining the hidden defects
inside. It may frequently miss subtle vulnerabilities despite that it has
already explored the vulnerable code paths. We propose SAVIOR, a new hybrid
testing framework pioneering a bug-driven principle. Unlike the existing hybrid
testing tools, SAVIOR prioritizes the concolic execution of the seeds that are
likely to uncover more vulnerabilities. Moreover, SAVIOR verifies all
vulnerable program locations along the executing program path. By modeling
faulty situations using SMT constraints, SAVIOR reasons the feasibility of
vulnerabilities and generates concrete test cases as proofs. Our evaluation
shows that the bug-driven approach outperforms mainstream automated testing
techniques, including state-of-the-art hybrid testing systems driven by code
coverage. On average, SAVIOR detects vulnerabilities 43.4% faster than DRILLER
and 44.3% faster than QSYM, leading to the discovery of 88 and 76 more
uniquebugs,respectively.Accordingtotheevaluationon11 well fuzzed benchmark

fundamental challenge to neural networks for unsupervised learning or
improvement beyond the label. In this paper, we show that the recent
unsupervised learning methods such as Noise2Noise, Stein's unbiased risk

but each of them are associated with its own limitations. Based on these

In particular, by employing combinatorial convolutional frame representation of
encoder-decoder CNN and synergistically combining it with the batch
normalization, we provide a close form formulation for the unbiased estimator
of the prediction error that can be minimized for neural network training

dwarf that we have discovered in the HSC-SSP. We have identified a
statistically significant (32.3$\sigma$) overdensity of stars having
characteristics of a metal-poor, old stellar population. The distance to this
stellar system is $D_{\odot}=209^{+20}_{-18}$ kpc with a $V$-band absolute
magnitude of $M_V=-4.53^{+0.23}_{-0.21}$ mag. Bo\""otes IV has a half-light
radius of $r_h=462^{+98}_{-84}$ pc and an ellipticity of
$0.64^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$, which clearly suggests that this is a dwarf satellite
galaxy. We also found another overdensity that appears to be a faint globular
cluster with $M_V=-0.20^{+0.59}_{-0.83}$ mag and $r_h=5.9^{+1.5}_{-1.3}$ pc
located at $D_{\odot}=46^{+4}_{-4}$ kpc. Adopting the recent prediction for the
total population of satellites in a MW-sized halo by Newton et al. (2018),
which combined the characteristics of the observed satellites by SDSS and DES
with the subhalos obtained in $\Lambda$CDM models, we estimate that there
should be about two MW satellites at $M_V\le0$ in the $\sim676$ deg$^2$ covered
by HSC-SSP, whereas that area includes six satellites. Thus, the observed
number of satellites is larger than the theoretical prediction. On the face of
it, we have a problem of too many satellites, instead of the well-known missing
satellites problem whereby the $\Lambda$CDM theory overpredicts the number of
satellites in a MW-sized halo. This may imply that the models need more
refinements for the assignment of subhalos to satellites such as considering
those found by the current deeper survey. [abridged]

$^{13}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\mathrm{n})^{16}\mathrm{O}$ during core He burning.
Neutron capture can last up to $\sim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{s}$ ($\sim 3\times

$10^{8}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Depending on the rotation speed and the mass loss
rate, a strong \textsl{s} can occur with production of elements up to Bi for
progenitors with initial metallicities of $[Z]\lesssim -1.5$. This result
suggests that rapidly-rotating massive metal-poor stars are likely the first

variational formulation of the modeling equation for which the differential
operator is applied to the test function so that low regularity for the exact

finite element method indeed yields a symmetric system involving both the
original equation for the primal variable and its dual for the dual variable

reinforcement learning (RL). We hypothesize that one critical element of
solving such problems is the notion of compositionality. With the ability to
learn concepts and sub-skills that can be composed to solve longer tasks, i.e.
hierarchical RL, we can acquire temporally-extended behaviors. However,
acquiring effective yet general abstractions for hierarchical RL is remarkably
challenging. In this paper, we propose to use language as the abstraction, as
it provides unique compositional structure, enabling fast learning and
combinatorial generalization, while retaining tremendous flexibility, making it
suitable for a variety of problems. Our approach learns an
instruction-following low-level policy and a high-level policy that can reuse
abstractions across tasks, in essence, permitting agents to reason using
structured language. To study compositional task learning, we introduce an
open-source object interaction environment built using the MuJoCo physics
engine and the CLEVR engine. We find that, using our approach, agents can learn
to solve to diverse, temporally-extended tasks such as object sorting and
multi-object rearrangement, including from raw pixel observations. Our analysis
reveals that the compositional nature of language is critical for learning
diverse sub-skills and systematically generalizing to new sub-skills in
comparison to non-compositional abstractions that use the same supervision.

shape reconstruction neural network (SRNN) and a spatial constraint network
(SCN). SRNN aims to maintain a realistic shape of the resulting segmentation.
It can be pre-trained by a set of label images, and then be embedded into a
unified loss function as a regularization term. Hence, no manually designed

2D slices. It is formulated and trained with the segmentation network via the
multi-task learning strategy. We evaluated the proposed method using 45
patients and compared with two state-of-the-art regularization schemes, i.e.,

differential equations (pPDEs) in, e.g. the optimization context, makes it
imperative to design vastly more efficient numerical solvers without
sacrificing any accuracy. The reduced basis method (RBM) presents itself as
such an option. With a mathematically rigorous error estimator, RBM seeks a
surrogate solution in a carefully-built subspace of the parameter-induced high
fidelity solution manifold. It can improve efficiency by several orders of
magnitudes leveraging an offline-online decomposition procedure. However, this
decomposition, usually through the empirical interpolation method (EIM) when
the PDE is nonlinear or its parameter dependence nonaffine, is either
challenging to implement, or severely degrading to the online efficiency.
  In this paper, we augment and extend the EIM approach in the context of
solving pPDEs in two different ways, resulting in the Reduced Over-Collocation
methods (ROC). These are stable and capable of avoiding the efficiency
degradation inherent to a direct application of EIM. There are two ingredients
of these methods. First is a strategy to collocate at about twice as many
locations as the number of bases for the surrogate space. The second is an
efficient approach for the strategic selection of the parameter values to build
the reduced solution space for which we study two choices, a recent empirical
L1 approach and a new indicator based on the reduced residual. Together, these
two ingredients render the schemes, L1-ROC and R2-ROC, online efficient and
immune from the efficiency degradation of EIM for nonlinear and nonaffine
problems offline and online. Numerical tests on three different families of
nonlinear problems demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy of these new
algorithms and their superior stability performance.

better characterisation of functional brain architectures than either modality

EEG and fMRI data from the same neuronal dynamics. We introduce the use of
Bayesian fusion to provide informative (empirical) neuronal priors - derived
from dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of EEG data - for subsequent DCM of fMRI
data. To illustrate this procedure, we generated synthetic EEG and fMRI
timeseries for a mismatch negativity (or auditory oddball) paradigm, using
biologically plausible model parameters (i.e., posterior expectations from a
DCM of empirical, open access, EEG data). Using model inversion, we found that
Bayesian fusion provided a substantial improvement in marginal likelihood or
model evidence, indicating a more efficient estimation of model parameters, in
relation to inverting fMRI data alone. We quantified the benefits of multimodal
fusion with the information gain pertaining to neuronal and haemodynamic
parameters - as measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence between their prior
and posterior densities. Remarkably, this analysis suggested that EEG data can
improve estimates of haemodynamic parameters; thereby furnishing
proof-of-principle that Bayesian fusion of EEG and fMRI is necessary to resolve
conditional dependencies between neuronal and haemodynamic estimators. These
results suggest that Bayesian fusion may offer a useful approach that exploits
the complementary temporal (EEG) and spatial (fMRI) precision of different data
modalities. We envisage the procedure could be applied to any multimodal
dataset that can be explained by a DCM with a common neuronal parameterisation.

Computer algorithms that can automatically track and quantify myocardial motion

two novel components: 1) utilizing a deep neural net to parameterize the

the neural net in a sequential multi-scale fashion to account for large
variations within the velocity field. Experiments demonstrate that NMSR yields
significantly better registration accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, such

strategic information revelation --- often described as a signaling scheme ---
in order to yield the most desirable equilibrium outcome. Recently, there has
been a large body of algorithmic study of designing optimal public signaling
schemes, a.k.a., public persuasion, which however is rifle with computational
intractability results. In this paper, we design efficient and tight algorithms
for public persuasion, and focus on a fundamental multi-agent persuasion model
with no inter-agent externalities and binary actions introduced by Arieli and
Babichenko. En route, we develop new algorithmic techniques which may be of
independent interests.
  First, we prove that optimal public persuasion is fixed parameter tractable.
Our main result here relies on an interesting connection to a basic question in
combinatorial geometry: how many cells can $n$ hyperplanes divide $R^d$ into?
We use this connection to show a new characterization of public persuasion,
which then enables efficient algorithm design. Second, we relax agent
incentives and show that optimal public persuasion admits a bi-criteria PTAS
for monotone submodular objectives and this approximation is tight. To prove
this result, we establish an intriguing ""noise stability"" property of
submodular functions which strictly generalizes the key result of Cheraghchi et
al., originally motivated by applications of learning submodular functions and
differential privacy. Finally, motivated by automated persuasion implemented as
software, we consider relaxing the equilibrium concept of the model to coarse
correlated equilibrium. Here we use a sophisticated primal-dual analysis to
establish the polynomial-time equivalence between optimal public persuasion and
the combinatorial problem of directly maximizing the sender's objective minus
any linear function.

employing ionic liquid gating, a selective control of volatile and non-volatile
superconductivity is achieved in pristine insulating Pr_2CuO_{4\pm\delta} film,
based on two distinct mechanisms: 1) with positive electric fields, the film
can be reversibly switched between non-superconducting and superconducting
states, attributed to the carrier doping effect. 2) The film becomes more
resistive by applying negative bias voltage up to -4 V, but strikingly, a
non-volatile superconductivity is achieved once the gate voltage is removed.
Such a persistent superconducting state represents a novel phenomenon in copper
oxides, resulting from the doping healing of oxygen vacancies in copper-oxygen

initiated by Corteel--Martinez--Savage--Weselcouch and Mansour--Shattuck in the
classical (non-consecutive) case, and later by Auli--Elizalde in the
consecutive case, where the entries of a pattern are required to occur in
adjacent positions. In this paper we continue this investigation by considering
{\em consecutive patterns of relations}, in analogy to the work of
Martinez--Savage in the classical case. Specifically, given two binary
relations $R_{1},R_2\in\{\leq,\geq,<,>,=,\neq\}$, we study inversion sequences
$e$ with no subindex $i$ such that $e_{i}R_{1}e_{i+1}R_{2}e_{i+2}$.
  By enumerating such inversion sequences according to their length, we obtain
well-known quantities such as Catalan numbers, Fibonacci numbers and central
polynomial numbers, relating inversion sequences to other combinatorial
structures. We also classify consecutive patterns of relations into Wilf
equivalence classes, according to the number of inversion sequences avoiding
them, and into more restrictive classes that consider the positions of the
occurrences of the patterns.
  As a byproduct of our techniques, we obtain a simple bijective proof of a
result of Baxter--Shattuck and Kasraoui about Wilf-equivalence of vincular
patterns, and we prove a conjecture of Martinez and Savage, as well as related
enumeration formulas for inversion sequences satisfying certain unimodality
conditions.

Posteriorly, we determine the bound-state solutions of the system: the Dirac
spinor and the relativistic energy spectrum. We verified that this spinor is
written in terms of the generalized Laguerre polynomials and this spectrum
depends on the effective quantum number $N_r$, angular velocity $\Omega$ and
parameter $s$ associated to the noninertial and spin effects, magnetic flux
$\Phi$, cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$, zero-point energy $E_0$, and on the

Due to the increasing penetration of rooftop PV, electric vehicles and demand
response applications, forecasting the load of individual and a small group of
households is becoming increasingly important. Forecasting the load accurately,
however, is considerable more difficult when only a few households are
included. A way to mitigate this challenge is to provide a set of scenarios
instead of one point forecast, so an operator or utility can consider a range
of behaviors. This paper proposes a novel scenario forecasting approach for
residential load using flow-based conditional generative models. Compared to
existing scenario forecasting methods, our approach can generate scenarios that
are not only able to infer possible future realizations of residential load
from the observed historical data but also realistic enough to cover a wide
range of behaviors. Particularly, the flow-based models utilize a flow of
reversible transformations to maximize the value of conditional density
function of future load given the past observations. In order to better capture
the complex temporal dependency of the forecasted future load on the condition,
we extend the structure design for the reversible transformations in flow-based
conditional generative models by strengthening the coupling between the output
and the conditional input in the transformations. The simulation results show
the flow-based designs outperform existing methods in scenario forecasting for

elastically mounted cylinder with very low values of mass and damping. We use
two methods to investigate this canonical problem: first we calculate the
instantaneous phase between the cylinder motion and the fluid forcing; second
we decompose the total hydrodynamic force into drag and lift components that
act along and normal to, respectively, the instantaneous effective angle of
attack. We focus on the phase dynamics in the large-amplitude-response range,
consisting of the initial, upper and lower branches of response. The
instantaneous phase between the transverse force and displacement shows
repeated phase slips separating periods of constant, or continuous-drifting,
phase in the second half of the upper branch. The phase between the lift
component and displacement shows strong phase locking throughout the
large-amplitude range - the average phase varies linearly with the primary
frequency - however the modulation of this phase is largest in the second half
of the upper branch. These observations suggest that the
large-amplitude-response dynamics is driven by two distinct limit cycles - one
that is stable over a very small range of reduced velocity at the beginning of
the upper branch, and another that consists of the lower branch. The chaotic
oscillation between them - the majority of the upper branch - occurs when
neither limit cycle is stable. The transition between the upper and lower
branches is marked by intermittent switching with epochs of time where
different states exist at a constant reduced velocity. These different states
are clearly apparent in the phase between the lift and displacement,
illustrating the utility of the force decomposition employed.

evident from the lack of far-infrared (FIR) emission, in sources within the
Herschel-SPIRE sample with X-ray luminosities exceeding a ``critical value'' of
L~10^37 W. Such a scenario would be consistent with the suppression of star
formation by the AGN, required by current theoretical models. Since absorption
of the 21-cm transition of neutral hydrogen (HI), which traces the star-forming
reservoir, also exhibits a critical value in the ultra-violet band (above
ionising photon rates of Q ~ 3 x 10^56 s^-1), we test the SPIRE sample for the
incidence of the detection of 250 micron emission with Q. The highest value at
which FIR emission is detected above the SPIRE confusion limit is Q = 8.9 x
10^57 s^-1, which is ~30 times that for the HI, with no critical value
apparent. Since complete ionisation of the neutral atomic gas is expected at Q
> 3 x 10^56 s-1., this may suggest that much of the FIR must arise from heating
of the dust by the AGN. However, integrating the ionising photon rate of each
star over the initial mass function, we cannot rule out that the high observed
ionising photon rates are due to a population of hot, massive stars.

is a challenging task, which requires careful balance between the amount of
depicted data and perceptual precision. Horizon graphs are a well-known
technique for compactly representing time series data. They provide fine
details while simultaneously giving an overview of the data where extrema are
emphasized. Horizon graphs compress the vertical resolution of the individual
line graphs, but they do not affect the horizontal resolution. We present two
variations of a new visualization technique called collapsed horizon graphs
which extend the idea of horizon graphs to two dimensions. Our main
contribution is a quantitative evaluation that experimentally compares four
visualization techniques with high visual information resolution (compact
boxplots, horizon graphs, collapsed horizon graphs, and braided collapsed
horizon graphs). The experiment investigates the performance of these
techniques across tasks addressing both individual graphs as well as groups of
adjacent graphs. Compact boxplots consistently provide good results for all
tasks, horizon graphs excel, for instance, in maximum tasks but underperform in
trend detection. Collapsed horizon graphs shine in certain tasks in which an
increased horizontal resolution is beneficial. Moreover, our results indicate
that the visual complexity of the techniques highly affects users' confidence

(NMR) spectroscopy with a superconducting flux qubit (FQ). Such NMR with the FQ
is attractive because of the possibility to detect the relatively small number
of nuclear spins in a local region ($\sim\mu$m) with low temperatures ($\sim$
mK) and low magnetic fields ($\sim$ mT), in which other types of quantum
sensing schemes cannot easily access. A sample containing nuclear spins is
directly attached on the FQ, and the FQ is used as a magnetometer to detect
magnetic fields from the nuclear spins. Especially, we consider two types of
approaches to NMR with the FQ. One of them is to use spatially inhomogeneous
excitations of the nuclear spins, which are induced by a spatially asymmetric
driving with radio frequency~(RF) pulses. Such an inhomogeneity causes a change
in the DC magnetic flux penetrating a loop of the FQ, which can be detected by
a standard Ramsey measurement on the FQ. The other approach is to use a
dynamical decoupling on the FQ to measure AC magnetic fields induced by Larmor
precession of the nuclear spins. In this case, neither a spin excitation nor a
spin polarization is required since the signal comes from fluctuating magnetic
fields of the nuclear spins. We calculate the minimum detectable density
(number) of the nuclear spins for the FQ with experimentally feasible
parameters. We show that the minimum detectable density (number) of the nuclear
spins with these approaches is around $10^{21}$ /cm$^3$ ($10^8$) with an
accumulation time of a second.

unweighted simple graphs with help of the sequences of matrices $ NM^{\{l\}} $.
The $ i^{th} $ element of structural descriptor sequence encodes the complete

that jets can be launched in the aftermath of stellar core collapse, likely by

bursts have only been observed accompanying Type Ibc supernovae, indicating a
stellar progenitor that lost its Hydrogen envelope before collapse. According
to recent hypothesis it is possible that jets are launched in core-collapse
events even when the progenitors still retain their Hydrogen envelopes,
however, such jets are not able to burrow through the star and will be stalled
into the interior of the progenitor star before escaping. These jets are called
chocked jets. High-energy neutrinos produced by such choked jets could escape
the stellar envelope and could be observed. Here we examine how multi-messenger
searches for high-energy neutrinos and core-collapse supernovae can detect or
limit the fraction of stellar collapses that produce jets. We find that a high
fraction of jet production is already limited by previous observational
campaigns. We explore possibilities with future observations using LSST,

stabilize an eigenstate of a Quantum Non-Demolition (QND) measurement operator.
In open-loop, the system converges to a random eigenstate of the measurement
operator. The role of the feedback is to prepare a prescribed QND eigenstate
with unit probability. To achieve this we introduce the use of Brownian motion
to drive the unitary control actions; the feedback loop just adapts the
amplitude of this Brownian noise input as a function of the system state.
Essentially, it ""shakes"" the system away from undesired eigenstates by applying
strong noise there, while relying on the open-loop dynamics to progressively
reach the target. We prove exponential convergence towards the target
eigenstate using standard stochastic Lyapunov methods. The feedback scheme and
its stability analysis suggest the use of an approximate filter which only
tracks the populations of the eigenstates of the measurement operator. Such
reduced filters should play an increasing role towards advanced quantum
technologies.

confirm that the magnitude and the covariance structure of gradient noise are
critical for regularization, it remains unclear whether or not the class of
noise distributions is important. In this work we provide negative results by
showing that noises in classes different from the SGD noise can also
effectively regularize gradient descent. Our finding is based on a novel
observation on the structure of the SGD noise: it is the multiplication of the
gradient matrix and a sampling noise that arises from the mini-batch sampling
procedure. Moreover, the sampling noises unify two kinds of gradient
regularizing noises that belong to the Gaussian class: the one using (scaled)
Fisher as covariance and the one using the gradient covariance of SGD as
covariance. Finally, thanks to the flexibility of choosing noise class, an
algorithm is proposed to perform noisy gradient descent that generalizes well,
the variant of which even benefits large batch SGD training without hurting
generalization.

  Transcribed and Untranscribed Speech with Backpropagation","14 pages, 10 figures",,,,"eess.AS cs.CL cs.LG cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  By representing speaker characteristic as a single fixed-length vector
extracted solely from speech, we can train a neural multi-speaker speech
synthesis model by conditioning the model on those vectors. This model can also
be adapted to unseen speakers regardless of whether the transcript of
adaptation data is available or not. However, this setup restricts the speaker
component to just a single bias vector, which in turn limits the performance of
adaptation process. In this study, we propose a novel speech synthesis model,
which can be adapted to unseen speakers by fine-tuning part of or all of the
network using either transcribed or untranscribed speech. Our methodology
essentially consists of two steps: first, we split the conventional acoustic
model into a speaker-independent (SI) linguistic encoder and a speaker-adaptive
(SA) acoustic decoder; second, we train an auxiliary acoustic encoder that can
be used as a substitute for the linguistic encoder whenever linguistic features
are unobtainable. The results of objective and subjective evaluations show that
adaptation using either transcribed or untranscribed speech with our
methodology achieved a reasonable level of performance with an extremely
limited amount of data and greatly improved performance with more data.
Surprisingly, adaptation with untranscribed speech surpassed the transcribed
counterpart in the subjective test, which reveals the limitations of the
conventional acoustic model and hints at potential directions for improvements.

  Manifolds: a non-asymptotic high concentration expansion in the small-sample
  regime",,,,,"math.DG math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The asymptotic concentration of the Fr{\'e}chet mean of IID random variables
on a Rieman-nian manifold was established with a central limit theorem by
Bhattacharya \& Patrangenaru (BP-CLT) [6]. This asymptotic result shows that
the Fr{\'e}chet mean behaves almost as the usual Euclidean case for
sufficiently concentrated distributions. However, the asymptotic covariance
matrix of the empirical mean is modified by the expected Hessian of the squared
distance. This Hessian matrix was explicitly computed in [5] for constant
curvature spaces in order to relate it to the sectional curvature. Although
explicit, the formula remains quite difficult to interpret, and the intuitive
effect of the curvature on the asymptotic convergence remains unclear.
Moreover, we are most often interested in the mean of a finite sample of small
size in practice. In this work, we aim at understanding the effect of the
manifold curvature in this small sample regime. Last but not least, one would
like computable and interpretable approximations that can be extended from the
empirical Fr{\'e}chet mean in Rie-mannian manifolds to the empirical
exponential barycenters in affine connection manifolds. For distributions that
are highly concentrated around their mean, and for any finite number of
samples, we establish explicit Taylor expansions on the first and second moment
of the empirical mean thanks to a new Taylor expansion of the Riemannian
log-map in affine connection spaces. This shows that the empirical mean has a
bias in 1/n proportional to the gradient of the curvature tensor contracted
twice with the covariance matrix, and a modulation of the convergence rate of
the covariance matrix proportional to the covariance-curvature tensor. We show
that our non-asymptotic high concentration expansion is consistent with the
asymptotic expansion of the BP-CLT. Experiments on constant curvature spaces
demonstrate that both expansions are very accurate in their domain of validity.
Moreover, the modulation of the convergence rate of the empirical mean's
covariance matrix is explicitly encoded using a scalar multiplicative factor
that gives an intuitive vision of the impact of the curvature: the variance of
the empirical mean decreases faster than in the Euclidean case in negatively
curved space forms, with an infinite speed for an infinite negative curvature.
This suggests potential links with the stickiness of the Fr{\'e}chet mean
described in stratified spaces. On the contrary, the variance of the empirical
mean decreases more slowly than in the Euclidean case in positive curvature
space forms, with divergence when we approach the limits of the Karcher \&
Kendall concentration conditions with a uniform distribution on the equator of
the sphere, for which the Fr{\'e}chet mean is not a single point any more.

color image. There are multiple methods to do the same. Old school methods used
machine learning algorithms and optimization techniques to suggest possible
colors to use. With advances in the field of deep learning, colorization
results have improved consistently with improvements in deep learning
architectures. The latest development in the field of deep learning is the
emergence of generative adversarial networks (GANs) which is used to generate
information and not just predict or classify. As part of this report, 2
architectures of recent papers are reproduced along with a novel architecture
being suggested for general colorization. Following this, we propose the use of
colorization by generating makeup suggestions automatically on a face. To do
this, a dataset consisting of 1000 images has been created. When an image of a
person without makeup is sent to the model, the model first converts the image
to grayscale and then passes it through the suggested GAN model. The output is
a generated makeup suggestion. To develop this model, we need to tweak the
general colorization model to deal only with faces of people.

still a challenge to generate coherent and diverse responses given previous
utterances. It's practical that a conversation takes place under a background,
meanwhile, the query and response are usually most related and they are
consistent in topic but also different in content. However, little work focuses
on such hierarchical relationship among utterances. To address this problem, we
propose a Conversational Semantic Relationship RNN (CSRR) model to construct
the dependency explicitly. The model contains latent variables in three
hierarchies. The discourse-level one captures the global background, the
pair-level one stands for the common topic information between query and
response, and the utterance-level ones try to represent differences in content.
Experimental results show that our model significantly improves the quality of
responses in terms of fluency, coherence and diversity compared to baseline
methods.

temperatures which require liquid helium for cooling. A promising approach to
overcome this obstacle for quantum technologies is based on deep level defects
in semiconductors, with the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond being the
most prominent example. Unfortunately, diamond in sufficient quality is scarce,
which motivated efforts to find similar defects in silicon carbide (SiC). So
far, many reports focus on investigations of point defects in irradiated 3C-SiC
and as grown material. However, the investigated defects are more or less a
product of coincidence for both. While in irradiated material the intentional
generation of specific defects is rather challenging, in as purchased material
the defects are actually more an unintentional by product of growth and process
conditions. This work proposes a new route: the incorporation and control of
deep level defects in 3C-SiC by epitaxial sublimation growth. The observed
defects in the near infrared show bright luminescence in the 175 K/200 K regime
and remain excitable up to 300 K. This could enable working temperatures above
the cryogenic limit. The joint origin of all detected defects is assigned to
the carbon vacancy.

process on a simplified rough energy landscape: energy minima where the system

are governed by the transition rates among these. In this work we consider the
case of purely activated dynamics, where the transition rates only depend on
the depth of the departing trap. The random connectivity and the disorder in
the trap depths make it impossible to solve the model analytically, so we base
our analysis on the spectrum of eigenvalues $\lambda$ of the master operator.
We compute the local density of states $\rho(\lambda|\tau)$ for traps with a
fixed lifetime $\tau$ by means of the cavity method. This exhibits a power law
behaviour $\rho(\lambda|\tau)\sim\tau|\lambda|^T$ in the regime of small
relaxation rates $|\lambda|$, which we rationalize using a simple analytical
approximation. In the time domain, we find that the probabilities of return to
a starting node have a power law-tail that is determined by the distribution of

performed by attempting to solve a non-convex optimization problem involving

the inversion problem.
  We show that for the realizable case, single layer inversion can be performed

  For generative models of arbitrary depth, we show that exact recovery is
possible in polynomial time with high probability, if the layers are expanding
and the weights are randomly selected. Very recent work analyzed the same
problem for gradient descent inversion. Their analysis requires significantly
higher expansion (logarithmic in the latent dimension) while our proposed

Nguyen-Breitkopf method. Besides, by tuning the concentration of the
constituents, it is possible to obtain samples those exhibit two important
structural characteristics; Fragility and Polymeric phase formation. The
present study essentially addresses these issues and endeavors to figure out
the corroboration among them. The relaxation behavior, when scrutinized in the
light of Diffusion Controlled Relaxation model, ascertains the fragility
threshold which is also identified as the margin between the two types of
polymeric phases. Simultaneously, it fathoms into the equivalent circuitry, its
elements and their behavioral changes with above mentioned features. The power

super-linearity remain significantly below and above the Jonscher's carrier

glimpse of the inflaton deceleration from fast-roll at the start of inflation.
If this were true, the spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations should be
distorted in a corresponding way, with a suppression of large angular scale
B-mode polarization that might be within reach for future probes like LiteBIRD.
We investigate this scenario by a semi-analytic method based on a truncation of
the B-mode polarization spectrum, which in our opinion has the virtue of
highlighting the underlying Physics. We present some mild evidence that, with
sufficient knowledge of the reionization process, the suppression of
large-scale B-modes might be within reach.

domain to a poorly-labeled target domain. A majority of existing works transfer
the knowledge at either feature level or sample level. Recent researches reveal
that both of the paradigms are essentially important, and optimizing one of
them can reinforce the other. Inspired by this, we propose a novel approach to
jointly exploit feature adaptation with distribution matching and sample
adaptation with landmark selection. During the knowledge transfer, we also take
the local consistency between samples into consideration, so that the manifold
structures of samples can be preserved. At last, we deploy label propagation to
predict the categories of new instances. Notably, our approach is suitable for
both homogeneous and heterogeneous domain adaptation by learning
domain-specific projections. Extensive experiments on five open benchmarks,
which consist of both standard and large-scale datasets, verify that our
approach can significantly outperform not only conventional approaches but also
end-to-end deep models. The experiments also demonstrate that we can leverage
handcrafted features to promote the accuracy on deep features by heterogeneous
adaptation.

type of functional groups as well as the length on the GNR Raman spectrum. We
show that the low-energy region, especially in presence of bulky functional
groups is populated by several modes, and a single radial breathing-like mode
cannot be identified. In the Raman optical region, we find that, except for the
fully-brominated case, all GNRs functionalized at the edges with different side
groups show a characteristic dispersion of the D peak (8-22 cm-1/eV). This has
been attributed to the internal degrees of freedom of these functional groups,
which act as dispersion-activating defects. The G peak shows small to
negligible dispersion in most of the cases, with larger values only in presence
of poor control of the edges functionalization, exceeding the values reported
for highly defected graphene. In conclusion, we have shown that the
characteristic dispersion of the G and D peaks offer further insight on the GNR
structure and functionalization, by making Raman spectroscopy an important tool

based on 1680 articles published between 1999 and 2019, which can serve as a
roadmap for research and practice in this area. Mobility modeling research has
accelerated the advancement of several fields of studies such as urban
planning, epidemic modeling, traffic engineering and contributed to the
development of location-based services. However, while the application of
mobility models in different domains has increased, the credibility of the
research results has decreased. We highlight two significant shortfalls
commonly observed in our reviewed studies: (1) data-agnostic model selection
resulting in a poor tradeoff between accuracy vs. complexity, and (2) failure
to identify the source of empirical gains, due to adoption of inaccurate
validation methodologies. We also observe troubling trends with respect to
application of Markov model variants for modeling mobility, despite the
questionable association of Markov processes and human-mobility dynamics. To
this end, we propose a data-driven mobility-modeling framework that quantifies
the characteristics of a dataset based on four mobility meta-attributes, in
order to select the most appropriate prediction algorithm. Experimental
evaluations on three real-world mobility datasets based on a rigorous
validation methodology demonstrate our frameworks ability to correctly analyze
the model accuracy vs. complexity tradeoff. We offer these results to the
community along with the tools and the literature meta-data in order to improve
the reliability and credibility of human mobility modeling research.

attempt at enforcing privacy needs to add minimal computational overhead to
avoid degrading control performance. In this paper, we propose several
transformation-based methods for enforcing data privacy. We also quantify the
amount of provided privacy and discuss how much privacy is lost when the
adversary has access to side knowledge. We address three different scenarios:
a) the cloud has no knowledge about the system being controlled; b) the cloud
knows what sensors and actuators the system employs but not the system
dynamics; c) the cloud knows the system dynamics, its sensors, and actuators.
In all of these three scenarios, the proposed methods allow for the control
over the cloud without compromising private information (which information is
considered private depends on the considered scenario).

comparably to either measuring the flow everywhere (while limiting actuators to

represents a T cell clone. The number of different naive T cell clones in an
organism reflects the number of different T cell receptors (TCRs) arising from
recombination of the V(D)J gene segments during T cell development in the
thymus. TCR diversity and more specifically, the clone abundance distribution
is an important factor in immune function. Specific recombination patterns
occur more frequently than others while subsequent interactions between TCRs
and self-antigens are known to trigger proliferation and sustain naive T cell
survival. These processes are TCR-dependent, leading to clone-dependent thymic
export and naive T cell proliferation rates. Using a mean-field approximation
to the solution of a regulated birth-death-immigration model and a modification
arising from sampling, we systematically quantify how TCR-dependent
heterogeneities in immigration and proliferation rates affect the shape of
clone abundance distributions (the number of different clones that are
represented by a specific number of cells, or ""clone counts""). By comparing
predicted clone counts derived from our heterogeneous birth-death-immigration
model with experimentally sampled clone abundances, we show that although
heterogeneity in immigration rates causes very little change to predicted
clone-counts, significant heterogeneity in proliferation rates is necessary to
generate the observed abundances with reasonable physiological parameter
values. Our analysis provides constraints among physiological parameters that
are necessary to yield predictions that qualitatively match the data.
Assumptions of the model and potentially other important mechanistic factors
are discussed.

that end we define and focus on a class of consistent vdW-DF versions that
adhere to the Lindhard screening logic of the full method formulation. The
consistent-exchange vdW-DF-cx version and its spin extension represent the
first examples of this class; In general, consistent vdW-DFs reflect a
concerted expansion of a formal recast of the adiabatic-connection formula, an
exponential summation of contributions to the local-field response, and the
Dyson equation. We argue that the screening emphasis is essential because the
exchange-correlation energy reflects an effective electrodynamics set by a
long-range interaction. Two consequences are that 1) there are, in principle,
no wiggle room in how one balances exchange and correlation, for example, in
vdW-DF-cx, and that 2) consistent vdW-DFs have a formal structure that allows
them to incorporate vertex-correction effects, at least in the case of levels
that experience recoil-less interactions (for example, near the Fermi surface).
We explore the extent to which the strictly nonempirical vdW-DF-cx formulation
can serve as a systematic extension of the constraint-based semilocal
functionals. For validation, we provide a complete survey of vdW-DF-cx
performance for broad molecular processes and comparing to the
quantum-chemistry calculations that are summarized in that paper. We also

domain of early-type galaxies in the WISE IR color-color diagram. We analyze
the stellar populations out to two effective radius, using the best-fitting
model to the measured absorption line-strength indices in the Lick/IDS system.
We find that stellar populations of the passive spirals span a wide range, even
in their centers, and hardly show any common trend amongst themselves either.
We compare the passive spirals with S0s selected in the same mass range. S0s
cover a wide range in age, metallicity, and [a/Fe], and stellar populations of
the passive spirals are encompassed in the spread of the S0 properties.
However, the distribution of passive spirals are skewed toward higher values of
metallicity, lower [a/Fe], and younger ages at all radii. These results show
that passive spirals are possibly related to S0s in their stellar populations.
We infer that the diversity in the stellar populations of S0s may result from
different evolutionary pathways of S0 formation, and passive spirals may be one
of the possible channels.

typically very costly, especially when dealing with response properties of
materials to e.g. electric fields, which require a good description of the
perturbed electronic density. In this work, we use Gaussian process regression
(GPR) to predict the static polarizability and dielectric susceptibility of
molecules and molecular crystals. We combine this framework with ab initio
molecular dynamics to predict their anharmonic vibrational Raman spectra. We
stress the importance of data representation, symmetry, and locality, by
comparing the performance of different flavors of GPR. In particular, we show
the advantages of using a recently developed symmetry-adapted version of GPR.
As an examplary application, we choose Paracetamol as an isolated molecule and
in different crystal forms. We obtain accurate vibrational Raman spectra in all
cases with less than 1000 training points, and obtain improvements when using a
GPR trained on the molecular monomer as a baseline for the crystal GPR models.
Finally, we show that our methodology is transferable across polymorphic forms:
we can train the model on data for one structure, and still be able to
accurately predict the spectrum for a second polymorph. This procedure provides
an independent route to access electronic structure properties when performing
force-evaluations on empirical force-fields or machine-learned potential energy
surfaces.

hierarchical organization of ties expressed in terms of dendrograms, with a

reverberant microphone signals commonly relies on power-spectral-density (PSD)
estimates of early source images, where early refers to reflections contained
within the same STFT frame. State-of-the-art approaches to multi-source early
PSD estimation, given an estimate of the associated relative early transfer
functions (RETFs), conventionally minimize the approximation error defined with
respect to the early correlation matrix, requiring non-negative inequality
constraints on the PSDs. Instead, we here propose to factorize the early
correlation matrix and minimize the approximation error defined with respect to
the early-correlation-matrix square root. The proposed minimization problem --
constituting a generalization of the so-called orthogonal Procrustes problem --
seeks a unitary matrix and the square roots of the early PSDs up to an
arbitrary complex argument, making non-negative inequality constraints
redundant. A solution is obtained iteratively, requiring one singular value
decomposition (SVD) per iteration. The estimated unitary matrix and early PSD
square roots further allow to recursively update the RETF estimate, which is
not inherently possible in the conventional approach. An estimate of the said
early-correlation-matrix square root itself is obtained by means of the
generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD), where we further propose to
restore non-stationarities by desmoothing the generalized eigenvalues in order
to compensate for inevitable recursive averaging. Simulation results indicate
fast convergence of the proposed multi-source early PSD estimation approach in
only one iteration if initialized appropriately, and better performance as
compared to the conventional approach.

problem of Extended Depth-of-Field (EDoF) in thick blood film microscopy for
rapid automated malaria diagnosis. High magnification oil-objectives (100x)
with large numerical aperture are usually preferred to resolve the fine
structural details that help separate true parasites from distractors. However,
such objectives have a very limited depth-of-field requiring the acquisition of
a series of images at different focal planes per field of view (FOV). Current
EDoF techniques based on multi-scale decompositions are time consuming and
therefore not suited for high-throughput analysis of specimens. To overcome
this challenge, we developed a new deep learning method based on Convolutional
Neural Networks (EDoF-CNN) that is able to rapidly perform the extended
depth-of-field while also enhancing the spatial resolution of the resulting
fused image. We evaluated our approach using simulated low-resolution z-stacks
from Giemsa-stained thick blood smears from patients presenting with Plasmodium
falciparum malaria. The EDoF-CNN allows speed-up of our digital-pathology
acquisition platform and significantly improves the quality of the EDoF
compared to the traditional multi-scaled approaches when applied to lower
resolution stacks corresponding to acquisitions with fewer focal planes, large
camera pixel binning or lower magnification objectives (larger FOV). We use the
parasite detection accuracy of a deep learning model on the EDoFs as a

human life with over 200 million cases globally leading to half-million deaths
annually. Of these, 90% of cases and of the mortality occurs in sub-Saharan
Africa, mostly among children. Although malaria prediction systems are central
to the 2016-2030 malaria Global Technical Strategy, currently these are
inadequate at capturing and estimating the burden of disease in highly endemic
countries. We developed and validated a computational system that exploits the
predictive power of current Machine Learning approaches on 22-years of
prospective data from the high-transmission holoendemic malaria
urban-densely-populated sub-Saharan West-Africa metropolis of Ibadan. Our
dataset of >9x104 screened study participants attending our clinical and
community services from 1996 to 2017 contains monthly prevalence, temporal,
environmental and host features. Our Locality-specific Elastic-Net based
Malaria Prediction System (LEMPS) achieves good generalization performance,
both in magnitude and direction of the prediction, when tasked to predict
monthly prevalence on previously unseen validation data (MAE<=6x10-2,
MSE<=7x10-3) within a range of (+0.1 to -0.05) error-tolerance which is
relevant and usable for aiding decision-support in a holoendemic setting. LEMPS
is well-suited for malaria prediction, where there are multiple features which
are correlated with one another, and trading-off between
regularization-strength L1-norm and L2-norm allows the system to retain
stability. Data-driven systems are critical for regionally-adaptable
surveillance, management of control strategies and resource allocation across
stretched healthcare systems.

alone can provide a fairly good measurement for $H_0$, but for other
cosmological parameters the GW data alone can only provide rather weak

index with similar properties to the SPI, but with improved methodology. In
comparison to the SPI, our MBSI-1 index allows for the use of different
zero-augmented distributions, it works with more flexible time-scales, can be
applied to shorter records of data and also takes into account temporal
dependencies in known seasonal behaviours. Our approach is implemented in an R

as revealed by a non-vanishing $Z_2$ invariant and an effective model from

by the irreducible representations of the magnetic space groups $C_{3i}^1$ and

frames. Within ISCLP, we estimate both filters jointly by means of a single
Kalman filter. We further propose a spectral Wiener gain post-processor, which
is shown to relate to the Kalman filter's posterior state estimate. The
presented ISCLP Kalman filter is benchmarked against two state-of-the-art
approaches, namely first a pair of alternating Kalman filters respectively
performing dereverberation and noise reduction, and second an MCLP+GSC Kalman

  The numerical tools we use for finding the invariant circles and calculating

outermost heliosphere. Turbulence, magnetic reconnection, and their link may be
responsible for magnetic energy conversion in these regions. The governing
mechanisms of such anisotropic and compressible magnetic turbulence in the
inner heliosheath (IHS) and in the local interstellar medium (LISM) still lack
a thorough description. The present literature mainly concerns large scales
which are not representative of the inertial-cascade dynamics of turbulence.
Moreover, lack of broadband spectral analysis makes the IHS dynamics critically
understudied. Our recent study shows that 48 s magnetic-field data from the
Voyager mission are appropriate for a spectral analysis over a frequency range
of six decades, from 5 x 10-8 Hz to 10-2 Hz. Here, focusing on the Voyager 2
observation interval from 2013.824 to 2016.0, we describe the structure of
turbulence in a sector zone of the IHS. A spectral break around 7 x 10-7 Hz
(magnetic structures with size l~1.3 Astronomical Units) separates the
energy-injection regime from the inertial-cascade regime of turbulence. A
second scale is observed around 6 x 10-5 Hz (l~ 0.017 AU) and corresponds to a
peak of compressibility and intermittency of fluctuations.

we propose a multi-graph decoding and rescoring strategy using bilingual and

proposed decoding scheme gives the freedom to design and employ alternative
search spaces for each (monolingual or bilingual) recognition task and enables
the effective use of monolingual resources of the high-resourced mixed language

Dutch text resources to improve the Dutch language model (LM) and compare the
performance of single- and multi-graph CS ASR systems on Dutch segments using
larger Dutch LMs. The ASR results show that the proposed approach outperforms
baseline single-graph CS ASR systems, providing better performance on the
monolingual Dutch segments without any accuracy loss on monolingual Frisian and

in biomedical research like randomized controlled trials (RCT). The standard
two-sample t-test relies on null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) via
p-values, which has several drawbacks. Bayesian alternatives were recently
introduced using the Bayes factor, which has its own limitations. This paper
introduces an alternative to current Bayesian two-sample t-tests by
interpreting the underlying model as a two-component Gaussian mixture in which
the effect size is the quantity of interest, which is most relevant in clinical
research. Unlike p-values or the Bayes factor, the proposed method focusses on
estimation under uncertainty instead of explicit hypothesis testing. Therefore,
via a Gibbs sampler the posterior of the effect size is produced, which is used
subsequently for either estimation under uncertainty or explicit hypothesis
testing based on the region of practical equivalence (ROPE). An illustrative
example, theoretical results and a simulation study show the usefulness of the
proposed method, and the test is made available in the R package bayest.

probabilities (FAPs) are the two main alternatives to proper distributions,
i.e. countably additive probabilities. Both of them can be seen as limits of
proper distribution sequences w.r.t. to some specific convergence modes.
Therefore, some authors attempt to link these two notions by this means, partly
using heuristic arguments. The aim of the paper is to compare these two kinds
of limits. We show that improper distributions and FAPs represent two distinct
characteristics of a sequence of proper distributions and therefore,
surprisingly, cannot be connected by the mean of proper distribution sequences.
More specifically, for a sequence of proper distribution which converge to both
an improper distribution and a set of FAPs, we show that another sequence of
proper distributions can be constructed having the same FAP limits and
converging to any given improper distribution. This result can be mainly
explained by the fact that improper distributions describe the behavior of the
sequence inside the domain after rescaling, whereas FAP limits describe how the
mass concentrates on the boundary of the domain. We illustrate our results with
several examples and we show the difficulty to define properly a uniform FAP
distribution on the natural numbers as an equivalent of the improper flat
prior. MSC 2010 subject classifications: Primary 62F15; secondary 62E17,60B10.

preliminary voting results of various countries rely on insecure communication
channels like telephone, fax or non-secure e-mail. Furthermore, regulations
typically do not mandate the use of secure channels for the transmission of

temporary nature, may have a severe impact on real-world decisions during the 3

this discrepancy can, e.g., benefit from stock market manipulation or call into
question the legitimacy of the elections. This work investigates the
cyber-risks in paper voting in a systematic manner by reviewing procedures in
several countries (Estonia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United

This has recently been verified also from space observations, at decameter

unclear whether the directivity is caused by the emission mechanism, by reduced
radio wave formation toward certain directions, or by absorption/blocking of
radio waves along the line of sight. We present here observations of three type
IV burst events that occurred on 23, 25, and 29 July 2004, and originated from

that in the last two events the type IV bursts experienced partial cut-offs in
their emission, that coincided with the appearance of shock-related type II
bursts. The type II bursts were formed at the flanks and leading fronts of
propagating coronal mass ejections (CMEs). These events support the suggestion
of absorption toward directions where the type II shock regions are located.

existing services. Several research works have been done in order to study
mobility behavior of users that mainly use users' significant locations.
However, these existing analysis are extremely intrusive because they require
the knowledge of the frequently visited places of users, which thus makes it
fairly easy to identify them. Consequently, in this paper, we present a
privacy-aware methodology to analyze mobility behavior of users. We firstly
propose a new metric based on the well-known Shannon entropy, called
spatio-temporal entropy, to quantify the mobility level of a user during a time
window. Then, we compute a sequence of spatio-temporal entropy from the
location history of the user that expresses user's movements as rhythms. We
secondly present how to study the effects of several groups of additional
variables on the evolution of the spatio-temporal entropy of a user, such as
spatio-temporal, demographic and mean of transportation variables. For this, we
use Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). The results firstly show that the
spatio-temporal entropy and GAMs are an ideal combination to understand
mobility behavior of an individual user or a group of users. We also evaluate
the prediction accuracy of a global GAM compared to individual GAMs and
individual AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. These last
results highlighted that the global GAM gives more accurate predictions of
spatio-temporal entropy by checking the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). In addition,
this research work opens various threads, such as the prediction of demographic
data of users or the creation of personalized mobility prediction models by
using movement rhythm characteristics of a user.

need for the prevalent density regression paradigm. Typical counting models
predict crowd density for an image as opposed to detecting every person. These
regression methods, in general, fail to localize persons accurate enough for
most applications other than counting. Hence, we adopt an architecture that
locates every person in the crowd, sizes the spotted heads with bounding box
and then counts them. Compared to normal object or face detectors, there exist
certain unique challenges in designing such a detection system. Some of them
are direct consequences of the huge diversity in dense crowds along with the
need to predict boxes contiguously. We solve these issues and develop our
LSC-CNN model, which can reliably detect heads of people across sparse to dense
crowds. LSC-CNN employs a multi-column architecture with top-down feedback
processing to better resolve persons and produce refined predictions at
multiple resolutions. Interestingly, the proposed training regime requires only
point head annotation, but can estimate approximate size information of heads.
We show that LSC-CNN not only has superior localization than existing density
regressors, but outperforms in counting as well. The code for our approach is

  Scatterings for the Direct Detection of Low-Mass Dark Matter","PhD Thesis (2019), 250 pages",,,,"hep-ph astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  If DM-matter scatterings are assumed to occur in a detector's target
material, collisions will naturally take place inside the bulk of planets and
stars as well. For large cross sections, these scatterings might occur in the
Earth or Sun even prior to the detection. In this thesis, we study the impact
of these pre-detection scatterings on direct searches of light DM with the use
of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. By simulating the trajectories and scatterings
of many individual DM particles in the Earth or Sun, we determine the local
distortions of the statistical properties of DM at any detector caused by
elastic DM-nucleus collisions. Scatterings inside the Earth distort the
underground DM density and velocity distribution. Any detector moves
periodically through these inhomogeneities due to the Earth's rotation, and the
expected event rate will vary throughout a sidereal day. Using MC simulations,
we can determine the exact amplitude and phase of this diurnal modulation for
any experiment. For even higher scattering probabilities, collisions in the
overburden above the typically underground detectors start to attenuate the
incoming DM flux. The critical cross section above which an experiment loses
sensitivity to DM itself is determined for a variety of DM-nucleus and
DM-electron scattering experiments and different interaction types.
Furthermore, we develop the idea that sub-GeV DM particles can enter the Sun,
gain kinetic energy by colliding on hot nuclei and get reflected with great
speeds. By deriving an analytic expressions for the particle flux from solar
reflection via a single scattering, we demonstrate the prospects of future
experiments to probe reflected DM and extend their sensitivity to lower masses
than accessible by halo DM alone. Finally, we present first results for MC
simulations of solar reflections taking into account the effect of multiple
scatterings.

scale (macroscale) can be produced by using a lattice substructure at
micrometer length scale (microscale). Such a system is called a metamaterial at
the macroscale as the mechanical characteristics deviate from the
characteristics at the microscale. As a remedy, metamaterial is modeled by
using additional parameters; we intend to determine them. A homogenization
approach based on the asymptotic analysis establishes a connection between
these different characteristics at micro- and macroscales. A linear elastic
first order theory at the microscale is related to a linear elastic second
order theory at the macroscale. Relation for parameters at the macroscale is
derived by using the equivalence of energy at macro- and microscales within a
so-called Representative Volume Element (RVE). Determination of parameters are
succeeded by solving a boundary value problem with the Finite Element Method
(FEM). The proposed approach guarantees that the additional parameters vanish
if the material is purely homogeneous, in other words, it is fully compatible
with conventional homogenization schemes based on spatial averaging techniques.
Moreover, the proposed approach is reliable as it ensures that such resolved
additional parameters are not sensitive to choices of RVE consisting in the
repetition of smaller RVEs but depend upon the intrinsic size of the structure.

varying planetary rotation rate and imposed equator-to-pole temperature

planetary vorticity gradients induced by the spherical curvature of the planet.
A regular baroclinic wave regime is also obtained at intermediate values of

regular waves exhibit some strong similarities to baroclinic storms observed on

to the multiple zonal jets observed on gas giant planets. Jets form on a scale
comparable to the most energetic eddies and the Rhines scale poleward of the

related with the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})_k/U(1)$ Euclidian black-hole coset model.
While various types of conformal boundary conditions (discrete and continuous
branes) have been formally identified for the the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})_k/U(1)$
coset CFT, we are only able in this work to identify conformal boundary
conditions (CBC) leading to a discrete boundary spectrum. The conformal
boundary conditions (CBC) we find are of two types. The first is free boundary
Potts spins, for which we confirm an old conjecture for the generating
functions of conformal levels, and show them to be related to characters in a
non-linear deformation of the $W_\infty$ algebra. The second type of CBC -
which corresponds to restricting the values of the Potts spins to a subset of
size $Q_1$, or its complement of size $Q-Q_1$, at alternating sites along the
boundary - is new, and turns out to be conformal in the antiferromagnetic case
only. Using algebraic and numerical techniques, we show that the corresponding
spectrum generating functions produce all the characters of discrete
representations for the coset CFT. The normalizability bounds of the associated
discrete states in the coset CFT are found to have a simple interpretation in
terms of boundary phase transitions in the lattice model. For $\sqrt{Q} = 2

computed tomography (CT) scanning are used to study the 3D structure of an
object through 2D observations. These observations are related to the original
3D object through orthogonal integral projections. For common 3D reconstruction
algorithms, computational efficiency requires the modeling of the 3D structures
to take place in Fourier space by applying the Fourier slice theorem. At
present, it is unclear how to differentiate through the projection operator,
and hence current learning algorithms can not rely on gradient based methods to
optimize 3D structure models. In this paper we show how back-propagation
through the projection operator in Fourier space can be achieved. We
demonstrate the validity of the approach with experiments on 3D reconstruction
of proteins. We further extend our approach to learning probabilistic models of
3D objects. This allows us to predict regions of low sampling rates or estimate
noise. A higher sample efficiency can be reached by utilizing the learned
uncertainties of the 3D structure as an unsupervised estimate of the model fit.
Finally, we demonstrate how the reconstruction algorithm can be extended with
an amortized inference scheme on unknown attributes such as object pose.
Through empirical studies we show that joint inference of the 3D structure and
the object pose becomes more difficult when the ground truth object contains
more symmetries. Due to the presence of for instance (approximate) rotational
symmetries, the pose estimation can easily get stuck in local optima,
inhibiting a fine-grained high-quality estimate of the 3D structure.

electronically-driven instabilities (i.e. a pure JT effect) such as KCrF3,
KCuF3 or LaVO3 and proceed to relax the structures, finding quantitatively the
JTD in excellent agreement with experiment; (ii) compounds such as LaMnO3 or
LaTiO3 that do not show electronically driven JTD despite orbital degeneracies,
because their strongly hybridized B, d-X, p states supply but too weak JT
forces to overcome the needed atomic distortions; (iii) although LaVO3 exhibits
similar B, d-X, p hybridizations as LaTiO3, the former compound exhibits a
robust electronic instability while LaTiO3 has zero stabilization energy, the

However, the success and competitiveness of future SAV services depend on their
operational models, which are linked intrinsically to the service configuration

result in a different demand. Using a comprehensive framework of SAV simulation
in a multi-modal dynamic demand system with integrated SAV user taste
variation, this study evaluates the performance of various SAV fleets and
vehicle capacities serving travelers across the Rouen Normandie metropolitan

performance of SAV is strongly correlated with the fleet size and the strategy
of individual or shared rides. Further analysis indicates that for the pricing

standard 4-seats car with shared ride remains the best option among all

order database images by decreasing similarity to the query. Recent deep models
for image retrieval have outperformed traditional methods by leveraging
ranking-tailored loss functions, but important theoretical and practical
problems remain. First, rather than directly optimizing the global ranking,
they minimize an upper-bound on the essential loss, which does not necessarily
result in an optimal mean average precision (mAP). Second, these methods
require significant engineering efforts to work well, e.g. special pre-training
and hard-negative mining. In this paper we propose instead to directly optimize
the global mAP by leveraging recent advances in listwise loss formulations.
Using a histogram binning approximation, the AP can be differentiated and thus
employed to end-to-end learning. Compared to existing losses, the proposed
method considers thousands of images simultaneously at each iteration and
eliminates the need for ad hoc tricks. It also establishes a new state of the

architectures within a comparably short search time. In this work, which is
motivated by the quest to further improve the learning speed of architecture
search, we evaluate the learning progress of the controller which generates the

generated by it at different controller training epochs, where architectures
are evaluated after having re-trained them from scratch. As a surprising
result, we find that the learning curves are completely flat, i.e., there is no
observable progress of the controller in terms of the performance of its
generated architectures. This observation is consistent across the CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 datasets and two different search spaces. We conclude that the high
quality of the models generated by ENAS is a result of the search space design

certain plausible requirements are fulfilled, P becomes an orthomodular poset

possible to consider sets of empirically found numerical events as members of
an algebra of S-probabilities. Then we discuss the problem to decide whether a
given small set Pn of S-probabilities can be embedded into a Boolean subalgebra
of an algebra P of S-probabilities, in which case we will call Pn Boolean
embeddable. If Pn is not Boolean embeddable, then the physical system at hand

quantum logic which can be represented by sets, we derive criteria for the
subset Pn of P to be Boolean embeddable which can be checked by very simple
procedures, for arbitrary S-probabilities we provide sets of Bell-like
inequalities which characterize the Boolean embeddability of Pn. Finally we
will show how these Bell-like inequalities fit into a general framework of Bell

complicated, however, with downscale transfers across almost all wavenumbers,
dominated by horizontally divergent modes, for \Omega* \lesssim 1/4. At higher

language understanding approach, we investigate the use of a transfer learning
strategy based on the principles of curriculum learning. This approach allows
us to exploit out-of-domain data that can help to prepare a fully neural
architecture. Experiments are carried out on the French MEDIA and PORTMEDIA
corpora and show that this end-to-end SLU approach reaches the best results
ever published on this task. We compare our approach to a classical pipeline
approach that uses ASR, POS tagging, lemmatizer, chunker... and other NLP tools
that aim to enrich ASR outputs that feed an SLU text to concepts system. Last,
we explore the promising capacity of our end-to-end SLU approach to address the
problem of domain portability.

asymmetric shares. The fairness concept we focus on is the weighted natural
generalization of maxmin share: WMMS fairness and OWMMS fairness. We first
highlight the fact that commonly used algorithms that work well for the
allocation of goods to asymmetric agents, and even for chores to symmetric
agents do not provide good approximations for allocation of chores to
asymmetric agents under WMMS. As a consequence, we present a novel
polynomial-time constant-approximation algorithm, via linear program, for
OWMMS. For two special cases: the binary valuation case and the 2-agent case,
we provide exact or better constant-approximation algorithms.

quantum oscillators that are not just in limit-cycle states, but rather display
a more complex bistable dynamics. Our oscillator model is purely dissipative,
with a two-photon gain balanced by single- and three-photon loss processes.
When the gain rate is low, loss processes dominate and the oscillator has a
very low photon occupation number. In contrast, for large gain rates, the
oscillator is driven into a limit-cycle state where photon numbers can become
large. The bistability emerges between these limiting cases with a region of
coexistence of limit-cycle and low-occupation states. Although an individual
oscillator has no preferred phase, when two of them are coupled together a
relative phase preference is generated which can indicate synchronization of
the dynamics. We find that the form and strength of the relative phase
preference varies widely depending on the dynamical states of the oscillators.
In the limit-cycle regime, the phase distribution is $\pi$-periodic with peaks
at $0$ and $\pi$, whilst in the low-occupation regime $\pi$-periodic phase
distributions can be produced with peaks at $\pi/2$ and $3\pi/2$. Tuning the
coupled system between these two regimes reveals a region where the relative
phase distribution has $\pi/2$-periodicity.

Palatini approach by considering the metric and connection as independent
variables. Assuming the connection to be torsionless, there can be infinitely
many metric-affine versions $L_{\rm P}$ of the original Lagrangian which differ
from each other by terms proportional to the non-metricity tensor. After
integrating out the connection, each $L_{\rm P}$ defines a metric theory, which
can either belong to the original Horndeski family, or it can be of a more
general DHOST type, or it shows the Ostrogradsky ghost. We analyse in detail
the subclass of the theory for which the equations are linear in the connection
and find that its metric-affine version is ghost-free. We present a detailed
classifications of homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies in these theories.
Taking into consideration other pieces of the Horndeski Lagrangian which are
non-linear in the connection leads to more complex metric-affine theories which
generically show the ghost. In some special cases the ghost can be removed by
carefully adjusting the non-metricity contribution, but it is unclear if this
is always possible. Therefore, the metric-affine generalisations of the
Horndeski theory can be ghost-free, but not all of them are ghost-free, neither
are they the only metric-affine theories for a gravity-coupled scalar field
which can be ghost-free.

neuronal model driven by symmetric $\alpha$-stable L\'evy noise. The considered
system is bistable: a stable fixed point (resting state) and a stable limit
cycle (oscillating state), and there is an unstable limit cycle (borderline
state) between them. Small disturbances may cause a transition between the two
stable states, thus a deterministic quantity, namely the maximal likely
trajectory, is used to analyze the transition phenomena in non-Gaussian
stochastic environment. According to the numerical experiment, we find that
smaller jumps of the L\'evy motion and smaller noise intensity can promote such
transition from the sustained oscillating state to the resting state. It also
can be seen that larger jumps of the L\'evy motion and higher noise intensity
are conducive for the transition from the borderline state to the sustained
oscillating state. As a comparison, Brownian motion is also taken into account.
The results show that whether it is the oscillating state or the borderline
state, the system disturbed by Brownian motion will be transferred to the
resting state under the selected noise intensity.

obliquities that are significantly tilted with respect to their orbital planes.
These large obliquities are a natural outcome of ``secular spin-orbit
resonance'', a configuration in which the planetary spin precession frequency
matches the frequency of orbit nodal regression, or a Fourier component
thereof. While exoplanet spin obliquities have not yet been measured directly,
they may be detectable indirectly through their signatures in various
observations, such as photometric measurements across the full phase of a
planet's orbit. In this work, we employ a thermal radiative model to explore
how large polar tilts affect full-phase light curves, and we discuss the range
of unique signatures that are expected to result. We show that the well-studied
short-period planets HD 149026 b, WASP-12 b, and CoRoT-2 b all exhibit phase
curve features that may arise from being in high-obliquity states. We also
constrain the parameters and assess the detectability of hypothetical
perturbing planets that could maintain the planets in these states. Among the
three planets considered, CoRoT-2 b has the tightest constraints on its
proposed obliquity ($45.8^{\circ} \pm 1.4^{\circ}$) and axial orientation. For
HD 149026 b, we find no significant evidence for a non-zero obliquity, and the
phase curve of WASP-12 b is too complicated by strong tidal distortions for a
conclusive assessment.

variety of visual analytics techniques have been developed to empower analysts
working with this form of data. These techniques generally display aggregate
statistics computed over sets of event sequences that share common patterns.
Such techniques are often hindered, however, by the high-dimensionality of many
real-world event sequence datasets because the large number of distinct event
types within such data prevents effective aggregation. A common coping strategy
for this challenge is to group event types together as a pre-process, prior to
visualization, so that each group can be represented within an analysis as a
single event type. However, computing these event groupings as a pre-process
also places significant constraints on the analysis. This paper presents a
dynamic hierarchical aggregation technique that leverages a predefined
hierarchy of dimensions to computationally quantify the informativeness of
alternative levels of grouping within the hierarchy at runtime. This allows
users to dynamically explore the hierarchy to select the most appropriate level
of grouping to use at any individual step within an analysis. Key contributions
include an algorithm for interactively determining the most informative set of
event groupings from within a large-scale hierarchy of event types, and a
scatter-plus-focus visualization that supports interactive hierarchical
exploration. While these contributions are generalizable to other types of
problems, we apply them to high-dimensional event sequence analysis using
large-scale event type hierarchies from the medical domain. We describe their
use within a medical cohort analysis tool called Cadence, demonstrate an
example in which the proposed technique supports better views of event sequence

flow of air, but conversely rotates when turned off and subjected to a strong
external flow, is a familiar example of reciprocal connection between physical
cause and effect. We explore here in a well controlled low Reynolds number
system whether such an exchange of the cause and effect also holds in the low
Reynolds number regime. As a case study we investigate the motion of two
microspheres which interact hydrodynamically through their surrounding fluid.
Each sphere is constrained in a fixed optical trap potential, allowing local

of superheavy nuclei (SHN). Its understanding will help to optimize entrance
channels for SHN studies. Quasifission also provides a probe to understand the
influence of shell effects in the formation of the fragments.
  Purpose: Investigate the role of shell effects in quasifission and their
interplay with the orientation of the deformed target in the entrance channel.
  Methods: $^{48}$Ca$+^{249}$Bk collisions are studied with the time-dependent
Hartree-Fock approach for a range of angular momenta and orientations.
  Results: Unlike similar reactions with a $^{238}$U target, no significant
shell effects which could be attributed to $^{208}$Pb ""doubly-magic"" nucleus
are found. However, the octupole deformed shell gap at $N=56$ seems to strongly
influence quasifission in the most central collisions.
  Conclusions: Shell effects similar to those observed in fission affect the
formation of quasifission fragments. Mass-angle correlations could be used to
experimentally isolate the fragments influenced by $N=56$ octupole shell gaps.

ability of many visual analytics systems to enable rapid, ad-hoc specification

user creates a cohort based on a specified set of dimensions, differences
across many other unseen dimensions may also be introduced. These unintended
side effects may result in the cohort no longer being representative of the
larger population intended to be studied, which can negatively affect the

generalizes the traditional definitions that only apply to a pair of nodes. The
monotonicity and convexity properties are preserved by the extended
definitions. The extended definitions provide new insights into graph Laplacian
definiteness and power network stability. It is proved that the Laplacian
matrix of a signed graph is positive semi-definite with only one zero
eigenvalue if and only if the effective conductances between some specific
pairs of node sets are positive. Also the number of Laplacian negative
eigenvalues is upper bounded by the number of negative weighted edges. In
addition, new conditions for the small-disturbance angle stability,
hyperbolicity and type of power system equilibria are established, which
intuitively interpret angle instability as the electrical antagonism between
certain two sets of nodes in the defined active power flow graph. Moreover, a
novel optimal power flow (OPF) model with effective conductance constraints is
formulated, which significantly enhances power system transient stability. By
the properties of extended effective conductance, the proposed OPF model admits
a convex relaxation representation that achieves global optimality.

is based on the novel insight that clustering models can be rewritten as neural

principal stress. This so called Lam\'e configuration has been widely used as
theoretical and experimental paradigms for wrinkling instabilities. In this
work, we explore the consequences of changing the geometry of this model

membrane. Using the Kolosoff-Inglis solution, we analyse the stress field
around the hole and identify three possible regions: taut, unidirectionally
tensioned and slack regions. According to these definitions, we classify in a
phase diagram the different stress states of the sheet as function of the hole
eccentricity and of the applied tensions. Finally, we quantify how the tension
lines vary with the geometry of the hole and discuss possible outcomes on the
emerging buckled patterns.

since it traces the history of galaxy formation and evolution. Such diffuse
radiation from near-UV to far-infrared wavelengths can interact with
$\gamma$-rays from distant sources such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and
is responsible for the high-energy absorption observed in their spectra.
However, probing the EBL from $\gamma$-ray spectra of AGNs is not trivial due
to internal processes that can mimic its effect. Such processes are usually
taken into account in terms of curvature of the intrinsic spectrum. Hence, an
improper choice of parametrization for the latter can seriously affect EBL
reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a statistical approach that avoids a
priori assumptions on the intrinsic spectral curvature and that, for each
source, selects the best-fit model on a solid statistical basis. By combining
the ${\it Fermi}$-LAT observations of 490 blazars, we determine the
$\gamma$-ray-inferred level of EBL for various state-of-the-art EBL models. We
discuss the EBL level obtained from the spectra of both BL Lacs and flat
spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) in order to investigate the impact of internal
absorption in different classes of objects. We further scrutinize constraints
on the EBL evolution from $\gamma$-ray observations by reconstructing the EBL
level in four redshift ranges, up to $z\sim2.5$. The approach implemented in
this paper, carefully addressing the question of the modeling of the intrinsic
emission at the source, can serve as a solid stepping stone for studies of
hundreds of high-quality spectra acquired by next-generation $\gamma$-ray

from one-neutron knockout reactions. Typically the parallel-momentum
distribution of the remaining core is measured after a high-energy collision of
the exotic projectile with a light target.
  Purpose: We study how the structure of halo nuclei affects knockout
observables considering an eikonal model of reaction.
  Method: To evaluate the sensitivity of both the diffractive and stripping
parallel-momentum distributions to the structure of halo nuclei, we consider
several descriptions of the projectile within a halo effective field theory. We
consider the case of 11Be, the archetypical one-neutron halo nucleus, impinging
on 12C at 68 MeV/nucleon, which are usual experimental conditions for such
measurements. The low-energy constants of the description of 11Be are fitted to
experimental data as well as to predictions of an ab initio nuclear-structure
model.
  Results: One-neutron knockout reaction is confirmed to be purely peripheral,
the parallel-momentum distribution of the remaining core is only sensitive to
the asymptotics of the ground-state wavefunction and not to its norm. The
presence of an excited state in the projectile spectrum reduces the amplitude
of the breakup cross section; the corresponding probability flux is transferred
to the inelastic-scattering channel. Although the presence of a resonance in
the core-neutron continuum significantly affects the energy distribution, it
has no impact on the parallel-momentum distribution.
  Conclusions: One-neutron knockout cross section can be used to infer
information about the tail of the ground-state wavefunction, viz. its
asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC). The independence of the
parallel-momentum distribution on the continuum description makes the
extraction of the ANC from this observable very reliable.

estimating the underlying manifold from which data is assumed to be sampled.
Since the unbounded tangent spaces natively represent a poor manifold estimate,
the problem reduces to one of estimating regions in the tangent space where it
acts as a relatively faithful linear approximator to the surface of the
manifold. Local PCA methods, such as the Mixtures of Probabilistic Principal
Component Analyzers method of Tipping and Bishop produce a subset of the

points in the training data used by the TBL to elements of the estimated
tangent bundle. We formulate three methods that use the data assigned to each

tangent space is a faithful estimate of the manifold and offer thoughts on how
this perspective is theoretically grounded in the manifold assumption. We seek

fair rate. RCP estimates the fair rate using two forms of feedback: rate
mismatch and queue size. An outstanding design question for RCP is whether the
queue size feedback is useful or not. To address this, we analyze stability and
the bifurcation properties of RCP in both the cases i.e., with and without
queue size feedback. The model considers flows with two different round-trip
times, operating over a single bottleneck link. By using an exogenous
bifurcation parameter, we show that the system loses stability via a Hopf
bifurcation and hence we can expect a limit cycle branching from the fixed
point. We highlight that the presence of queue feedback can readily destabilize
the system. Using Poincar{\`e} normal forms and the center manifold theorem, we
show that the Hopf bifurcation is super-critical in the case of RCP without
queue feedback. Whereas, in the presence of queue feedback, we show that the
system can undergoes a sub-critical Hopf bifurcation for some parameter values.
A sub-critical Hopf bifurcation can result in either large amplitude limit
cycles or unstable limit cycles, and hence should be avoided in engineering
applications. Thus, the presence of queue feedback would create adverse effects
on the stability of the emerging limit cycles. In essence, the analytical
results of RCP with two delays favor the design choice that uses feedback based
only on rate mismatch. The theoretical analysis is validated with numerical
computations and some packet level simulations as well.

the one which contains all singular integral operators with flip and piecewise
quasicontinous $\mathcal{L}(H)$-valued generating functions on the unit circle.
The result is a generalization of an older result where the same problem, but
without the flip operator was considered. The stability criterion is obtained
via $C^*$-algebra methods and says that a sequence of finite sections is stable
if and only if certain operators associated with that sequence (via
$^*$-homomorphisms) are invertible.

approaches to simulate stress-induced martensitic transformation in shape
memory alloys (SMA). One model is a crystal plasticity based model and the
other describes the evolution of the microstructure with a Boltzmann-type
statistical approach. Both models consider a self-consistent scheme to perform
the scale transition from the local thermomechanical behavior to the global
one. The way the two modeling approaches describe the local behavior is
analyzed. Similarities and differences are pointed out. Numerical simulations
of the thermo-mechanical behavior of an isotropic titanium-niobium SMA are
performed. These alloys have known a growing interest of scientific community
given their high potential for application in the biomedical field.
Stress-strain curves obtained from the two simulations are compared with
experimental results. Evolutions of volume fractions of martensite variants
predicted by the two approaches are compared for <100>, <110> and <111> tensile
directions. Due to the absence of comparative studies between multiscale models
dedicated for SMA, this paper fills a gap in the state of the art in this field
and provides a significant step toward the definition of an efficient numerical
tool for the analysis of SMA behavior under multiaxial loadings.

scales, finally annihilating when reaching the core size. The energy spectrum
varies as $k^{-3}$, similar to the spectrum known for 2D classical-fluid
enstrophy cascades. The dynamics of the cascade can also be studied, and for
the case of a sharply peaked initial vortex-pair distribution, it takes about
four eddy turnover times for the system to evolve to the decaying $k^{-3}$
cascade, in agreement with recent computer simulations. These insights into the
nature of the cascade also allow a better understanding of the phase-ordering
process of temperature-quenched 2D superfluids, where the decay of the

networks is proposed using machine learning. Hyperledger fabric, which is a
blockchain platform developed as part of the Hyperledger project, though looks
very apt for IoT applications, has comparatively low tolerance for malicious
activities in an untrustworthy environment. To that end, we propose AI-enabled
blockchain (AIBC) with a 2-step consensus protocol that uses an outlier
detection algorithm for consensus in an IoT network implemented on hyperledger
fabric platform. The outlier-aware consensus protocol exploits a supervised
machine learning algorithm which detects anomaly activities via a learned
detector in the first step. Then, the data goes through the inherent Practical
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus protocol in the hyperledger fabric
for ledger update. We measure and report the performance of our framework with
respect to the various delay components. Results reveal that our implemented
AIBC network (2-step consensus protocol) improves hyperledger fabric
performance in terms of fault tolerance by marginally compromising the delay
performance.

valid only over a narrow optical bandwidth. In order to analyze the range of
validity of the ME and its applicability to future wide-band systems, we
present numerical simulations, showing the interplay between NLI generation and
PMD over long dispersion-uncompensated optical links, using coherent
polarization division multiplexing (PDM) quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)
formats. Using a Monte-Carlo analysis of different PMD realizations based on
the coupled nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equations, we show that PMD has a
negligible effect on NLI generation, independently from the total system

safely used to estimate NLI generation well beyond its bandwidth of validity

and engineering costs that impact movement across landscapes. Cost surfaces are
a crucial aspect of route optimization and least cost path (LCP) calculations
and are used in a wide range of disciplines including computer science,
landscape ecology, and energy infrastructure modeling. Linear features present
a key weakness to traditional routing calculations along costs surfaces because
they cannot identify whether moving from a cell to its adjacent neighbors
constitutes crossing a linear barrier (increased cost) or following a corridor
(reduced cost). Following and avoiding linear features can drastically change
predicted routes. In this paper, we introduce an approach to address this
""adjacency"" issue using a search kernel that identifies these critical barriers
and corridors. We have built this approach into a new Java-based open-source
software package called CostMAP (cost surface multi-layer aggregation program),
which calculates cost surfaces and cost networks using the search kernel.
CostMAP not only includes the new adjacency capability, it is also a versatile
multi-platform package that allows users to input multiple GIS data layers and
to set weights and rules for developing a weighted-cost network. We compare
CostMAP performance with traditional cost surface approaches and show
significant performance gains, both following corridors and avoiding barriers,
using examples in a movement ecology framework and pipeline routing for carbon
capture, and storage (CCS). We also demonstrate that the new software can
straightforwardly calculate cost surfaces on a national scale.

hypoxia development on Oregon shelf during April-August of 2002, 2006, and
2008. We found that shelf hypoxia existed during summer months of all three
years. It was characterized by variable severity, horizontal and vertical
extent, duration and timing, and it was more pronounced in 2002 and 2006. By
the means of numerical sensitivity analysis we found out that: inadequate
initial DO and NO3 conditions in late-spring 2002 prevented or delayed hypoxia
development; offshore and especially northern DO and NO3 boundary conditions
are important to simulating hypoxia on the Oregon shelf, this was especially
critical for early bottom hypoxia on the shelf north of 45N in 2006; hypoxia
occurred earlier in the north in 2006 and in the south (Heceta Bank) in 2002,
perhaps, due to different northern boundary conditions for these years; the DO
and NO3 conditions at western open boundary located some 400 km offshore are
unimportant for DO dynamics in spring-summer. Although DO production due to
biological processes is large, physical processes, mostly horizontal advection
and diffusion, are responsible for net DO reduction in spring-summer and
hypoxia onset in summer on the Oregon shelf. The physical mechanism most
responsible for Oregon shelf hypoxia is the coastal upwelling. Diffusive fluxes
of NO3 and DO are negligible at northern and southern boundaries of the Oregon
shelf and appreciable at the western boundary. In 2006, about two thirds of
total April-August DO loss happened in April-May as a result of strong and
long-lasting upwelling event.

compensation in the upper ocean. A series of simulations model the role of
mixing in scenarios initialized with geostrophically-adjusted compensated and

influence of mixing on these gradients using idealized conditions with zero
surface heat and momentum flux. Prompted by theoretical considerations and
observed consequences of mixing, a new non-linear horizontal diffusion scheme
is introduced as an alternative to the standard Laplacian diffusion. Results
suggest that when horizontal mixing is parameterized using constant
diffusivities, horizontal density compensation is substantially unchanged as
the gradients erode. Simulations using the new scheme, which parameterizes
mixing with horizontal diffusivities scaled by squared buoyancy gradient,
suggest that horizontal mixing can produce compensated gradients during this
decay, but only at scales of 10 km and less. Reducing vertical mixing to small
background values has a similar effect, increasing the degree of compensation
at submesoscales. Reproducing observed compensated thermohaline variability in
the mixed layer at scales greater than 10 km requires external forcing. These
results show important influences of mixing on density compensation within the
ageostrophic submesoscale regime. In the transition from a horizontally
compensated mixed layer to a partially compensated thermocline, advection must
play an important role; mixing alone is insufficient.

according to the powertrain type and its component efficiencies.
Simultaneously, the burden on the driver is reduced by optimizing the vehicle
velocity, whilst minimizing any journey time penalty.In this work, the
development of dependable Automated Driving Functions is exemplified by the
Traffic Light Assistant, an adaptive strategy that utilizes predictions of
preceding traffic, upcoming road curvature, inclination, speed limits, and

runs over straight lines and re-orientations. This erratic motion may be
influenced by external factors, like chemicals, nutrients, the extra-cellular

the signal eventually adapting its dynamics. We propose a kinetic transport
equation implementing a velocity-jump process in which the transition
probability takes into account a double bias, which acts, respectively, on the
choice of the direction of motion and of the speed. The double bias depends on
two different non-local sensing cues coming from the external environment. We
analyze how the size of the cell and the way of sensing the environment with
respect to the variation of the external fields affect the cell population
dynamics by recovering an appropriate macroscopic limit and directly
integrating the kinetic transport equation. A comparison between the solutions
of the transport equation and of the proper macroscopic limit is also

It speeds up the process from the initial idea to an actual device and saves
resources by reducing the number of built prototypes. This is also a
significant practical motivator behind scientific research in contemporary
high-temperature superconductor (HTS) AC loss modelling. However, in the
scientific literature in this field, consistent practices about modelling
terminology have not been established. Then, it is up to the reader to decide,
what is the true intent and meaning of the authors. Consequently, the
interpretation of such literature might be very much reader-dependent.
Moreover, an inseparable part of the whole modelling process is the development
of modelling approaches and numerical methods and comparing the predictions
obtained via modelling to experimentally achieved results: It is commonplace to
discuss the accuracy of modelling results or the validation of a model. In this
paper, we discuss the terminology related to theories, models and experiments
in the context of HTS AC loss modelling. We discuss the recursive nature of
theories and models in this context, discuss the compatibility of discrete
formulations of physics utilized in our field with the corresponding continuum
descriptions, as well as with intuition, and interpret the perceived meaning of
validation of a self-consistent model, shedding light on the relationships
between theories, models and measurements. We present our view on understanding
these relations in the familiar context of AC losses in HTS. As a result, we
end this paper with four conjectures describing our views.

mesoscopic phase-field computational methods in order to investigate
phase-transformation in polycrystalline Aluminum microstructure. In fact,
microstructural computational modeling of engineering materials could help to
optimize their mechanical properties for industrial applications (e.g.
directional solidification for turbine blades). As a result, a multiscale
modeling approach is developed to find a relation between manufacturing
variables (e.g. temperature) and microstructural properties of crystalline
materials (e.g. grain size), which could be used to develop an advanced
manufacturing process for sensitive applications. The results show that
atomistic modeling of grain growth could be used as a first-principle approach
in order to study phase transformation's kinetics, which could capture
morphology of polycrystalline materials more accurately. On the other hand,
phase-field mesoscopic approach needs less computational efforts, but still it
relies on semi-empirical data to capture accurate phase transformation regimes,
which makes this approach suitable for rapid examining of new manufacturing
conditions as well as its effects on microstructural properties of
polycrystalline materials.

benefits of this technological advancement to the borough of computational

the case. Though some significant progress has been made, chiefly by Kuprov and
collaborators, one cannot help but observe that there is still much to be done.
In our view, the difficulties are not to be entirely ascribed to technology,
but, rather, may mostly stem from the inadequacy of the conventional
theoretical tools commonly used. We introduce in this paper a set of
theoretical tools which can be employed in the description and efficient
simulation of multispin magnetic resonance spectra. The so-called
Holstein-Primakoff transformation lies at the heart of these, and provides a
very close connection to discrete mathematics (from graph theory to number
theory). The aim of this paper is to provide a reasonably comprehensive and
easy-to-understand introduction to the Holstein-Primakoff (HP) transformation
(and related bosons) to researchers and students working in the field of
magnetic resonance. We also focus on how through the use of the HP
transformation, we can reformulate many challenging computing problems
encountered in multispin systems as enumerative combinatoric problems. This,
one could say, is the HP transformation's primary forte. As a matter of
illustration, our main concern here will be on the use of the HP bosons to
characterize and eigendecompose a class of multispin Hamiltonians often
employed in high-resolution magnetic resonance.
