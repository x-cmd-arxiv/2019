when their goals, or rewards in the environment change. While such flexibility
is a hallmark of intelligent behaviour, these multi-task scenarios remain an
important challenge for machine learning algorithms and neurobiological models
alike. We investigated two approaches that could enable this flexibility:
factorized representations, which abstract away general aspects of a task from
those prone to change, and nonparametric, memory-based approaches, which can
provide a principled way of using similarity to past experiences to guide
current behaviour. In particular, we combine the successor representation (SR)
that factors the value of actions into expected outcomes and corresponding
rewards with evaluating task similarity through clustering the space of reward
functions. The proposed algorithm inverts a generative model over tasks, and
dynamically samples from a flexible number of distinct SR maps while
accumulating evidence about the current task context through amortized
inference. It improves SR's transfer capabilities and outperforms competing
algorithms and baselines in settings with both known and unsignalled rewards
changes. Further, as a neurobiological model of spatial coding in the
hippocampus, it explains important signatures of this representation, such as
the ""flickering"" behaviour of hippocampal maps, and trajectory-dependent place
cells (so-called splitter cells) and their dynamics. We thus provide a novel
algorithmic approach for multi-task learning, as well as a common normative
framework that links together these different characteristics of the brain's
spatial representation.

transferred into the interior of a thick film, we present a force-based theory
for dynamical gradients in thick films with one vapor interface that includes
collective elasticity effects. Quantitative applications to the foundational
hard sphere fluid and polymer melts of diverse fragilities are presented. We
predict a roughly exponential spatial variation of total activation barrier
which is non-perturbatively modified to ~10 particle diameters into film. This
leads to prediction of a reduced alpha relaxation time gradient of a double
exponential form characterized by a nearly constant spatial decay length, in
qualitative accord with simulations. These spatially heterogeneous changes of
the temperature variation of the alpha time result in a large and long-range
gradient of the local glass transition temperature. An average interfacial
layer thickness relevant to ensemble-averaged dielectric and other experiments
is also computed. It is predicted to be rather large at the bulk glass
transition temperature, decreasing roughly linearly with heating. Spatially
inhomogeneous power law decoupling of the alpha relaxation time from its bulk
value is predicted, with an effective exponent that decays to zero with
distance from the free surface in a nearly exponential manner, trends which are
in qualitative accord with recent simulations. This behavior and the double
exponential alpha time gradient are related and can be viewed as consequences
of an effective quasi-universal factorization of the total barrier in films
into the product of its bulk temperature dependent value times a function
solely of location in the film.

tasks for teleoperated field robotics in order to allow operators to use the
full range of human motions without being limited by the dynamics of the
robotic manipulator. A new variable impedance actuator (VIA) was designed,
capable of reproducing motions through teleoperation from precise positioning
tasks to highly dynamic tasks. The design requirements based on previous human
user studies were a stiffness changing time of 50 ms, a peak output velocity of
20 rad/s and variable damping allowing to suppress undesired oscillations. This
is a unique combination of features that was not met by other VIAs. The new
design has three motors in parallel configuration: two responsible for changing
the VIA's neutral position and effective stiffness through a sliding pivot
point lever mechanism, and the third acting as variable damper. A prototype was
built and its performance measured with an effective stiffness changing time of
50 to 120 ms for small to large stiffness steps, nominal output velocity of 16
rad/s and a variable damper with a damping torque from 0 to 3 Nm. Its effective
stiffness range is 0.2 to 313 Nm/rad. This concludes that the new actuator is
particularly suitable for highly dynamic tasks. At the same time, the new
actuator is also very versatile, making it especially interesting for
teleoperation and human-robot collaboration.

methods to compress them is one of the primary goals of machine learning. Given
a dataset lying in a high-dimensional space (in principle hundreds to several
thousands of dimensions), it is often useful to project it onto a
lower-dimensional manifold, without loss of information. Identifying the
minimal dimension of such manifold is a challenging problem known in the
literature as intrinsic dimension estimation (IDE). Traditionally, most IDE
algorithms are either based on multiscale principal component analysis (PCA) or
on the notion of correlation dimension (and more in general on
k-nearest-neighbors distances). These methods are affected, in different ways,
by a severe curse of dimensionality. In particular, none of the existing
algorithms can provide accurate ID estimates in the extreme locally
undersampled regime, i.e. in the limit where the number of samples in any local
patch of the manifold is less than (or of the same order of) the ID of the
dataset. Here we introduce a new ID estimator that leverages on simple
properties of the tangent space of a manifold to overcome these shortcomings.
The method is based on the full correlation integral, going beyond the limit of
small radius used for the estimation of the correlation dimension. Our
estimator alleviates the extreme undersampling problem, intractable with other
methods. Based on this insight, we explore a multiscale generalization of the
algorithm. We show that it is capable of (i) identifying multiple
dimensionalities in a dataset, and (ii) providing accurate estimates of the ID
of extremely curved manifolds. In particular, we test the method on manifolds
generated from global transformations of high-contrast images, relevant for
invariant object recognition and considered a challenge for state-of-the-art ID
estimators.

Furthermore, we propose that weight tensors in networks with proper order and

The proposed set of algorithms includes the Schur complement solver and the

to solve the gradient flow (GF) equations taking into account the fermion
determinant exactly, with high performance. We can find both real and complex
saddle points and describe the structure of the Lefschetz thimbles
decomposition for large enough lattices to extrapolate the results to the
thermodynamic limit. The algorithms are described for a general lattice fermion
model, with emphasis on two types of lattice discretizations for relativistic
fermions (staggered and Wilson), as well as on interacting tight-binding models
for condensed matter systems. We apply these algorithms to the Hubbard model on
a hexagonal lattice, dealing with lattice volumes as large as 12x12 with 256
steps in Euclidean time, in order to capture the properties of the thimbles
decomposition as the thermodynamic, low-temperature, and continuum limits are
approached. The complexity of the thimbles decomposition appears to be
dependent on the form of the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation. In
particular, the evidence is provided for the existence of an optimal regime for
the hexagonal lattice Hubbard model, with a reduced number of thimbles being
important in the overall sum. We have performed quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
simulations using GF to deform the integration contour into the complex plane
and demonstrated the agreement with exact diagonalization on small volumes (8
sites in space) if optimal setup for HS transformation is used. The residual

limits of parameters on general grounds, we focus on CFTs on specific
geometries conformally equivalent to a pair of $d \ge 4$
AdS${}_d$-Schwarzschild black holes of radius $R$. Such cases allow
perturbative analyses of non-uniform funnels associated with Gregory-Laflamme
zero-modes. For $d=4$ we construct a phase diagram for pure funnels and
droplets by constructing the desired bulk solutions numerically. The fat
non-uniform funnel is a particular interesting phase that dominates at small
$R$ (due to having lowest free energy) despite being sub-dominant in the
perturbative regime. The uniform funnel dominates at large $R$, and droplets
and thin funnels dominate at certain intermediate values. The thin funnel phase
provides a mystery as it dominates over our other phases all that way to a
critical $R_{\mathrm{turn}}$ beyond which it fails to exist. The free energy of
the system thus appears to be discontinuous at $R_{\mathrm{turn}}$, but such
discontinuities are forbidden by the 2nd law. A new more-dominant phase is thus
required near $R_{\mathrm{turn}}$ but the nature of this phase remains unclear.

orthogonal matrix parameters, we present $\textit{polar expansion},$ a general
approach to Monte Carlo simulation from probability distributions on the
Stiefel manifold. To bypass many of the well-established challenges of
simulating from the distribution of a random orthogonal matrix
$\boldsymbol{Q},$ we construct a distribution for an unconstrained random
matrix $\boldsymbol{X}$ such that $\boldsymbol{Q}_X,$ the orthogonal component
of the polar decomposition of $\boldsymbol{X},$ is equal in distribution to
$\boldsymbol{Q}.$ The distribution of $\boldsymbol{X}$ is amenable to Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation using standard methods, and an
approximation to the distribution of $\boldsymbol{Q}$ can be recovered from a
Markov chain on the unconstrained space. When combined with modern MCMC
software, polar expansion allows for routine and flexible posterior inference
in models with orthogonal matrix parameters. We find that polar expansion with
adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is an order of magnitude more efficient than
competing MCMC approaches in a benchmark protein interaction network
application. We also propose a new approach to Bayesian functional principal
components analysis which we illustrate in a meteorological time series
application.

delays which increase with increasing wavelength. It is thought that this is
due to thermal reprocessing of the X-ray emission by the accretion disk. In
this scenario, the variable X-ray flux from the corona illuminates the
accretion disk where it is partially reflected, and partially absorbed and
thermalized in the disk producing a UV/optical reverberation signal. This will
lead to a time lag increasing with wavelength. However, although the shape of
the observed time-lags as a function of wavelength is consistent with the model
predictions, their amplitude suggested a disk which is significantly hotter
than expected. In this work, we estimate the response functions and the
corresponding time lags assuming a standard Novikov-Thorne accretion disk
illuminated by a point-like X-ray source. We take into account all relativistic
effects in the light propagation from the X-ray source to the disk then to the
observer. We also compute the disk reflection, accounting for its ionization
profile. Our results show that thermal reverberation effects are stronger in
sources with large X-ray source height and low accretion rate. We also found
that the time lags increase with height and accretion rate. We apply our model
to NGC 5548 and we show that the observed lags in this source can be explained
by the model, for a source height of $\sim 60 ~\rm r_g$ and an accretion rate
of a few percent of the Eddington limit for a maximally-spinning black hole.

in quantum mechanics, on the basis of their short-time exponential growth found
in some particular set-ups. However, it has been seen that this behavior is not
universal. Therefore, we query other quantum chaos manifestations arising from
the OTOCs and we thus study their long-time behavior in systems of completely
different nature: quantum maps, which are the simplest chaotic one-body system
and spin chains, which are many-body systems without a classical limit. It is
shown that studying the long-time regime of the OTOCs it is possible to detect
and gauge the transition between integrability and chaos, and we benchmark the
transition with other indicators of quantum chaos based on the spectra and the
eigenstates of the systems considered. For systems with classical analogue, we
show that the proposed OTOC indicators have a very high accuracy that allow to
detect subtle features along the integrability-to-chaos transition.

second author, coherent states are defined as eigenvectors of a Toeplitz
annihilation operator. These coherent states are studied in the case when the
algebra is the generically non-commutative Manin plane. In usual quantization
schemes one starts with a classical phase space, then quantizes it in order to
produce annihilation operators and then their eigenvectors and eigenvalues. But
we do this in the opposite order, namely the set of the eigenvalues of the
previously defined annihilation operator is identified as a generalization of a
classical mechanical phase space. We introduce the resolution of the identity,
upper and lower symbols as well as a coherent state quantization, which in turn
quantizes the Toeplitz quantization. We thereby have a curious composition of
quantization schemes. We proceed by identifying a generalized Segal-Bargmann
space SB of square-integrable, anti-holomorphic functions as the image of a
coherent state transform. Then SB has a reproducing kernel function which
allows us to define a secondary Toeplitz quantization, whose symbols are
functions. Finally, this is compared with the coherent states of the Toeplitz
quantization of a closely related non-commutative space known as the
paragrassmann algebra.

protoplanetary disks, and has been thought to significantly affect planet
formation at all stages. If dry particles break up more easily than icy ones,
then the snowline causes a traffic jam, because small grains drift inward at
lower speeds than larger pebbles. Aims. We aim to evaluate the effect of high
dust concentrations around the snowline onto the gas dynamics. Methods. Using
numerical simulations, we model the global radial evolution of an axisymmetric
protoplanetary disk. Our model includes particle growth, evaporation and
recondensation of water, and the back-reaction of dust onto the gas, taking
into account the vertical distribution of dust particles. Results. We find that
the dust back-reaction can stop and even reverse the net flux of gas outside
the snowline, decreasing the gas accretion rate onto the star to under $50\%$
of its initial value. At the same time the dust accumulates at the snowline,
reaching dust-to-gas ratios of $\epsilon \gtrsim 0.8$, and delivers large
amounts of water vapor towards the inner disk, as the icy particles cross the
snowline. However, the accumulation of dust at the snowline and the decrease in
the gas accretion rate only take place if the global dust-to-gas ratio is high
($\varepsilon_0 \gtrsim 0.03$), if the viscous turbulence is low ($\alpha_\nu
\lesssim 10^{-3} $), if the disk is large enough ($r_c \gtrsim 100\,
\textrm{au}$), and only during the early phases of the disk evolution ($t
\lesssim 1\, \textrm{Myr}$). Otherwise the dust back-reaction fails to perturb
the gas motion.

recent development of on-demand single-electron sources. Versatile devices can
be designed using several single-electron sources, possibly of different types,
coupled to the same quantum circuit. However, if combined \textit{non-locally}
to avoid cross-talk, the resulting architecture becomes very sensitive to
electronic decoherence. To circumvent this problem, we here analyse
two-particle sources that operate with several single-electron (or hole)
emitters attached in series to the same electronic waveguide. We demonstrate
how such a device can emit exactly two electrons without exciting unwanted
electron-hole pairs if the driving is adiabatic. Going beyond the adiabatic
regime, perfect two-electron emission can be achieved by driving two quantum
dot levels across the Fermi level of the external reservoir. If a
single-electron source is combined with a source of holes, the emitted
particles can annihilate each other in a process which is governed by the
overlap of their wave functions. Importantly, the degree of annihilation can be
controlled by tuning the emission times, and the overlap can be determined by
measuring the shot noise after a beam splitter. In contrast to a Hong-Ou-Mandel
experiment, the wave functions overlap close to the emitters and not after
propagating to the beam splitter, making the shot noise reduction less
susceptible to electronic decoherence.

matter mass and mean dark matter density within the optical extent of galaxies,
for large samples of objects. Here we consider theoretical predictions for the
latter quantity, $\bar{\rho}_{dm}$, measured within the isophotal radius
$R_{23.5}$, for isolated halos with universal density profiles. Through a
combination of empirical scaling relations, we show that $\bar{\rho}_{dm}$ is
expected to depend weakly on halo mass and strongly on redshift. When galaxy
halos fall into larger groups or clusters they become tidally stripped,
reducing their total dark matter mass, but this process is expected to preserve
central density until an object is close to disruption. We confirm this with
collisonless simulations of cluster formation, finding that subhalos have
values of $\bar{\rho}_{dm}$ close to the analytic predictions. This suggests
that $\bar{\rho}_{dm}$ may be a useful indicator of infall redshift onto the
cluster. We test this hypothesis with data from the SHIVir survey, which covers
a reasonable fraction of the Virgo cluster. We find that galaxies with high
$\bar{\rho}_{dm}$ do indeed trace the densest regions of the cluster, with a
few notable exceptions. Samples selected by environment have higher densities
at a significance of 3.5-4$\sigma$, while samples selected by density are more
clustered at 3-3.5$\sigma$ significance. We conclude that halo density can be a
powerful tracer of the assembly history of clusters and their member galaxies.

spin-triplet pairs, it is possible to sustain long-ranged spin-polarized
supercurrents flowing through strongly polarized ferromagnets. Obtaining such a
conversion via spin-orbit interactions, rather than magnetic inhomogeneities,
has recently been explored in the literature. A challenging aspect with regard
to experimental detection has been that in order for Rashba spin-orbit
interactions, present e.g. at interfaces due to inversion symmetry breaking, to
generate such long-ranged supercurrents, an out-of-plane component of the
magnetization is required. This limits the choice of materials and can induce
vortices in the superconducting region complicating the interpretation of
measurements. Therefore, it would be desirable to identify a way in which
Rashba spin-orbit interactions can induce long-ranged supercurrents for purely
in-plane rotations of the magnetization. Here, we show that this is possible in
a lateral Josephson junction where two superconducting electrodes are placed in
contact with a ferromagnetic film via two thin, heavy normal metals. The
magnitude of the supercurrent in such a setup becomes tunable by the in-plane
magnetization angle when using only a single magnetic layer. These results
could provide a new and simpler way to generate controllable spin-polarized
supercurrents than previous experiments which utilized complicated magnetically
textured Josephson junctions.

theory. In this language, the familiar suppression of instanton effects by
light fermions can be understood as the decoupling of the 3-form. Even if all
fermions remain massive, such decoupling may occur on the basis of an
explicitly unbroken but anomalous global symmetry in the fermionic sector. This
should be forbidden by quantum gravity, which leads us to conjecture a related,
cutoff-dependent lower bound on the induced axion potential. Finally, we note
that the gravitational counterpart of the above are K3 instantons. These are
small fluctuations of Euclidean spacetime with K3 topology, which induce
fermionic operators analogous to the 't Hooft vertex in gauge theories.
Although Planck-suppressed, they may be phenomenologically relevant if
accompanied by other higher-dimension fermion operators or if the K3 carries
appropriate gauge fluxes.

constrain cosmological models directly from galaxy cluster dynamical

line-of-sight velocity measurements to directly constrain cosmological

tension with the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) TT fiducial value,

of the galaxy cluster Abell 523 at $z=0.104$. The peculiar morphology of the
cluster radio halo and its outlier position in the radio power P(1.4 GHz) -
X-ray luminosity plane make it an ideal candidate for the study of radio-X-ray
correlations and for the search of inverse Compton (IC) emission. We
constructed thermodynamic maps derived from the XMM observations to describe in
detail the physical and dynamical state of the ICM. We performed a
point-to-point comparison in terms of surface brightness between the X-ray and
radio emissions, to quantify their morphological discrepancies. Making use of
NuSTAR's hard X-ray focusing capability, we looked for IC emission both
globally and locally, after modeling the purely thermal component with a
multi-temperature description. The thermodynamic maps suggest the presence of a
secondary merging process that could be responsible for the peculiar radio halo
morphology. This hypothesis is supported by the comparison between the X-ray
and radio surface brightnesses, which shows a broad intrinsic scatter and a
series of outliers. The global NuSTAR spectrum can be explained by purely
thermal gas emission, and there is no convincing evidence that an IC component
is needed. The $3\sigma$ upper limit on the IC flux in the 20-80 keV band is in
the range $\left[2.2 - 4.0\right] \times 10^{-13} \, \mathrm{erg} \,
\mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, implying a lower limit on the magnetic
field strength in the range $B > [0.23 - 0.31] \, \mu G$. Locally, we looked
for IC emission in the central region of the cluster radio halo finding a
$3\sigma$ upper limit on the 20-80 keV non-thermal flux of $3.17 \times

$g$-functions in 2d QFT; an overlap between an integrable boundary state and a
state corresponding to the single-trace operator. We then determine the
boundary state at finite coupling using the symmetry, the crossing equation and
the boundary Yang-Baxter equation. With the resulting boundary state, we derive
the ground-state $g$-function based on TBA and conjecture its generalization to
other states. This is the first fully nonperturbative proposal for the

Should even a small population of PBHs with masses $\gtrsim

intergalactic medium and provide insight into novel processes at work in the

${\textit{(i)}}$ the modification to the primordial power spectrum (and thus
also the halo mass function) induced by Poisson noise, ${\textit{(ii)}}$ a
uniform heating and ionization of the intergalactic medium via X-rays produced
during accretion, and ${\textit{(iii)}}$ a local modification to the
temperature and density of the ambient medium surrounding isolated PBHs. Using
a four-parameter astrophysical model, we show that experiments like SKA and

high redshift. At times and in regions where feedback heating is ineffective,
hot gas in the galaxy halo is expected to form a cooling flow, where the gas
advects inward on a cooling timescale. Cooling flow solutions can thus be used
as a benchmark for observations and simulations to constrain the timing and
extent of feedback heating. Using analytic calculations and idealized 3D
hydrodynamic simulations, we show that for a given halo mass and cooling
function, steady-state cooling flows form a single-parameter family of
solutions, while initially hydrostatic gaseous halos converge on one of these
solutions within a cooling time. The solution is thus fully determined once
either the mass inflow rate $\dot{M}$ or the total halo gas mass are known. In
the Milky Way (MW) halo, a cooling flow with $\dot{M}$ equal to the star
formation rate predicts a ratio of the cooling time to the free-fall time of
~10, similar to some feedback-regulated models. This solution also correctly
predicts observed OVII and OVIII absorption columns, and the gas density
profile implied by OVII and OVIII emission. These results suggest ongoing
heating by feedback may be negligible in the inner MW halo. Extending similar
solutions out to the cooling radius however underpredicts observed OVI columns
around the MW and around other low-redshift star-forming galaxies. This can be
reconciled with the successes of the cooling flow model with either a mechanism
which preferentially heats the OVI-bearing outer halo, or alternatively if OVI
traces cool photoionized gas beyond the accretion shock. We also demonstrate
that the entropy profiles of some of the most relaxed clusters are reasonably
well described by a cooling flow solution.

(SM) and various SUSY extensions: CMSSM/mSUGRA, high-scale SUSY and
radiatively-driven natural SUSY (RNS). Rather general arguments from string
theory suggest a (possibly mild) statistical draw towards vacua with large soft
SUSY breaking terms. These vacua must be tempered by an anthropic veto of
non-standard vacua or vacua with too large a value of the weak scale m(weak).
We argue that the SM, the CMSSM and the various high-scale SUSY models are all
expected to be relatively rare occurances within the string theory landscape of
vacua. In contrast, models with TeV-scale soft terms but with m(weak)~100 GeV
and consequent light higgsinos (SUSY with radiatively-driven naturalness)
should be much more common on the landscape. These latter models have a
statistical preference for m_h~ 125 GeV and strongly interacting sparticles
beyond current LHC reach. Thus, while conventional naturalness favors
sparticles close to the weak scale, stringy naturalness favors sparticles so
heavy that electroweak symmetry is barely broken and one is living dangerously
close to vacua with charge-or-color breaking minima, no electroweak breaking or
pocket universe weak scale values too far from our measured value. Expectations
for how landscape SUSY would manifest itself at collider and dark matter search
experiments are then modified compared to usual notions.

the construction of coarse spaces for certain problems, especially for

removes the watermark with minimum requirements; it just relies on public
unlabeled data and a black-box access to the classification label. It does not
need classification confidences or access to the model's sensitive information
such as the training data set, the trigger set or the model parameters. The
white-box attack, proposes an efficient watermark removal when the parameters
of the marked model are available; our white-box attack does not require access
to the labeled data or the trigger set and improves the runtime of the
black-box attack up to seventeen times. We as well prove the security
inadequacy of the backdoor-based watermarking in keeping the watermark
undetectable by proposing an attack that detects whether a model contains a
watermark. Our attacks show that a recipient of a marked model can remove a
backdoor-based watermark with significantly less effort than training a new
model and some other techniques are needed to protect against re-distribution
by a motivated attacker.

systems. When designing constellations, both the locations and probability of
occurrence of the points can be optimized. These approaches are referred to as
geometric and probabilistic shaping, respectively. Usually, the geometry of the
constellation is fixed, e.g., quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is used. In
such cases, the achievable information rate can still be improved by
probabilistic shaping. In this work, we show how autoencoders can be leveraged
to perform probabilistic shaping of constellations. We devise an
information-theoretical description of autoencoders, which allows learning of
capacity-achieving symbol distributions and constellations. Recently, machine
learning techniques to perform geometric shaping were proposed. However,
probabilistic shaping is more challenging as it requires the optimization of
discrete distributions. Furthermore, the proposed method enables joint
probabilistic and geometric shaping of constellations over any channel model.
Simulation results show that the learned constellations achieve information
rates very close to capacity on an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel
and outperform existing approaches on both AWGN and fading channels.

reconstruction and tracking often fail in these cases, and other approaches
(e.g., light field video) typically rely on constrained viewing conditions,
which limit interactivity. We circumvent these difficulties by presenting a
learning-based approach to representing dynamic objects inspired by the
integral projection model used in tomographic imaging. The approach is
supervised directly from 2D images in a multi-view capture setting and does not
require explicit reconstruction or tracking of the object. Our method has two
primary components: an encoder-decoder network that transforms input images
into a 3D volume representation, and a differentiable ray-marching operation
that enables end-to-end training. By virtue of its 3D representation, our
construction extrapolates better to novel viewpoints compared to screen-space
rendering techniques. The encoder-decoder architecture learns a latent
representation of a dynamic scene that enables us to produce novel content
sequences not seen during training. To overcome memory limitations of
voxel-based representations, we learn a dynamic irregular grid structure
implemented with a warp field during ray-marching. This structure greatly
improves the apparent resolution and reduces grid-like artifacts and jagged
motion. Finally, we demonstrate how to incorporate surface-based
representations into our volumetric-learning framework for applications where
the highest resolution is required, using facial performance capture as a case

  This result is obtained following a sequence of steps: when layer $2$ is

angle $-\theta$ of the linear momentum .Due to the discreet lattice, in layer
$1$, the Fourier transform conserves the linear momentum $modulo$ the hexagonal

translated into comparing two protein expression probability density functions

develop a novel multiple testing method, called TEAM (Testing on the
Aggregation tree Method), to identify those bins that harbor differential pdfs
while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) under the desired level. TEAM
embeds the testing procedure into an aggregation tree to test from fine- to
coarse-resolution. The procedure achieves the statistical goal of pinpointing
differential pdfs to the smallest possible regions. TEAM is computationally
efficient, capable of analyzing large flow cytometry data sets in much shorter
time compared with competing methods. We applied TEAM and competing methods on
a flow cytometry data set to identify T cells responsive to the cytomeglovirus

monofunctional, bifunctional, and polyfunctional T cells while the competing
methods either did not finish in a reasonable time frame or provided less

correction should be applied to SFR calibrations when used in edge-on galaxies,
due to attenuation by dust. The updated SFR values also show newly discovered

previously-measured relationship between radio scale height and radio diameter
originates from star formation within the disk. We also identify a region of
star formation located at extreme distance from the disk of NGC 4157, possibly

that this hypothesis is indeed satisfied in incompressible MHD turbulence.
After an initial transient period, the ratio of parallel to perpendicular

downlink channel with two different correlation patterns and at high long-term

channel, part of the equivalent noise in the channel goes away, and
implementing two conventional equalizers leads to a better performance compared
to the channel matched filter equalizer (CMFE). These results are verified for
uniform linear and uniform planar arrays. In the latter, due to more
correlation, the performance drop with a spatially correlated channel is
larger, but the performance gain against channel matched filter precoder or
equalizer is also bigger. In highly correlated cases, the performance can be a
significant multiple of that of the channel matched filter precoder or

candidate as a possible polar from its multi-year Catalina Real-Time Transient
Survey (CRTS) optical light curve. Photometric monitoring of 22 eclipses in
2015 and 2017 was performed with the 2.1-m Otto Struve Telescope at McDonald
Observatory. We derive an unambiguous high-precision ephemeris. Strong evidence
that CRTS J0350+3232 is a polar comes from optical spectroscopy obtained over a
complete orbital cycle using the Apache Point Observatory 3.5-m telescope. High
velocity Balmer and He II $\lambda$4686{\AA} emission line equivalent width
ratios, structures, and variations are typical of polars and are modulated at
the same period, 2.37-hrs (142.3-min), as the eclipse to within uncertainties.
The spectral energy distribution and luminosity is found to be comparable to
that of AM Herculis. Pre-eclipse dips in the light curve show evidence for
stream accretion. We derive the following tentative binary and stellar
parameters assuming a helium composition white dwarf and a companion mass of
0.2 M$_{\odot}$: inclination i = 74.68$^{o}$ ${\pm}$ 0.03$^{o}$, semi-major
axis a = 0.942 ${\pm}$ 0.024 R$_{\odot}$, and masses and radii of the white

for any uninformative states or entanglement used in corresponding discrete

these predictive methods, however, require real time location data for

concerns. Meanwhile, web search queries of anonymous users have been collected
by web companies. Although such data raise less privacy concerns, they have
been under-utilized for various applications. In this study, we investigate
whether web search data observed prior to the disaster can be used to predict
the evacuation decisions. More specifically, we utilize a ""session-based query

prior to evacuation. Our proposed approach is empirically tested using web
search data collected from users affected by a major flood in Japan. Results
are validated using location data collected from mobile phones of the same set

of the most commonly used first order methods almost surely (under random
initializations) and with step-size being small enough, avoid strict saddle
points, as long as the objective function $f$ is $C^2$ and has Lipschitz
gradient. The key observation was that first order methods can be studied from
a dynamical systems perspective, in which instantiations of Center-Stable
manifold theorem allow for a global analysis. The results of the aforementioned
papers were limited to the case where the step-size $\alpha$ is constant, i.e.,
does not depend on time (and bounded from the inverse of the Lipschitz constant
of the gradient of $f$). It remains an open question whether or not the results
still hold when the step-size is time dependent and vanishes with time.
  In this paper, we resolve this question on the affirmative for gradient
descent, mirror descent, manifold descent and proximal point. The main
technical challenge is that the induced (from each first order method)
dynamical system is time non-homogeneous and the stable manifold theorem is not
applicable in its classic form. By exploiting the dynamical systems structure
of the aforementioned first order methods, we are able to prove a stable
manifold theorem that is applicable to time non-homogeneous dynamical systems
and generalize the results in \cite{LPP} for vanishing step-sizes.

degrade the classifier's accuracy when used for training. We propose a
Generative Adversarial Net with three components: generator, discriminator, and

detectability constrains that can be expected in realistic attacks and to
identify the regions of the underlying data distribution that can be more

detection of thoracic diseases and abnormalities. However, it is a challenging
problem with high inter-rater variability and inherent ambiguity due to
inconclusive evidence in the data, limited data quality or subjective
definitions of disease appearance. Current deep learning solutions for chest
radiograph abnormality classification are typically limited to providing
probabilistic predictions, relying on the capacity of learning models to adapt
to the high degree of label noise and become robust to the enumerated causal
factors. In practice, however, this leads to overconfident systems with poor
generalization on unseen data. To account for this, we propose an automatic
system that learns not only the probabilistic estimate on the presence of an
abnormality, but also an explicit uncertainty measure which captures the
confidence of the system in the predicted output. We argue that explicitly
learning the classification uncertainty as an orthogonal measure to the
predicted output, is essential to account for the inherent variability
characteristic of this data. Experiments were conducted on two datasets of
chest radiographs of over 85,000 patients. Sample rejection based on the
predicted uncertainty can significantly improve the ROC-AUC, e.g., by 8% to
0.91 with an expected rejection rate of under 25%. Eliminating training samples
using uncertainty-driven bootstrapping, enables a significant increase in
robustness and accuracy. In addition, we present a multi-reader study showing
that the predictive uncertainty is indicative of reader errors.

Gaussian mode. Here, we generalize that result for an arbitrary incoherent

leads to a vast and rich spectrum of self-focusing phenomena, which is absent
in the single-beam case. Specifically, we find that interactions between
different modes may increase or decrease the required critical power relative
to the sum of individual powers. In particular, high-orbital angular momentum
modes can be focused with less power in the presence of low-orbital angular
momentum beams than when propagating alone. The decrease in required critical
power can be made arbitrarily large by choosing the appropriate combinations of
modes. Besides, in the presence of interactions, an equilibrium configuration
of stationary spot-size for all modes in a superposition may not even exist, a
fundamental difference to the single-beam case in which a critical power for
self-focusing always exists.

expectation. Moreover, decoding stimuli or decisions via metastable states can
be carried out trial-by-trial. Focusing on metastability will allow us to shift
our perspective on neural coding from traditional concepts based on
trial-averaging to models based on dynamic ensemble representations. Recent

construction of new devices. In this work, we investigate this possibility in
the realm of quantum graphs. The study allows the identification of two
distinct periodic quantum effects which are related to quantum complexity, one
being the identification of transport inefficiency, and the other the presence
of peaks of full transmission inside regions of suppression of transport in
some elementary arrangements of graphs. Motivated by the power of quantum
graphs, we elaborate on the construction of simple devices, based on microwave
and optical fibers networks, and also on quantum dots, nanowires and nanorings.
The elementary devices can be used to construct composed structures with
important quantum properties, which may be used to manipulate the quantum
transport.

liquid-gas phase transition are investigated in thermal symmetric and
asymmetric nuclear matter with the covariant density functional (CDF) theory.
Although uncertainty remains in predicting the critical parameters such as the
critical temperature and pressure from various CDF functionals, several
correlations are explored numerically and verified to be approximately linear
between them. These correlations become worse when nuclear matter is more
isospin asymmetric, resulting mainly from the effects induced by symmetry
energy. By looking over the isospin dependence of the critical temperature, the
role of the symmetry energy in LG transition properties of asymmetric matter is
realized. The change of critical temperature with isospin asymmetry is found to
be correlated well with and as a consequence could be constrained by the
density slope of symmetry energy at saturation density. Then, the structure of
phase diagram of thermal nuclear matter is analyzed carefully. It is revealed
that the contribution from symmetry energy dominates the size of liquid-gas
phase coexistence area. Moreover, the specific pattern of the phase diagram
could be determined by the critical temperature at non-zero isospin asymmetry,
illustrated from the correlations of the temperature with pressures at several
characteristic points, paving the possible way to further explore the structure
of liquid-gas phase diagram of thermal nuclear matter.

the state and action from which the agent queries the model, which remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we propose to generate such states by using
the trajectory obtained from Hill Climbing (HC) the current estimate of the
value function. This has the effect of propagating value from high-value
regions and of preemptively updating value estimates of the regions that the
agent is likely to visit next. We derive a noisy projected natural gradient
algorithm for hill climbing, and highlight a connection to Langevin dynamics.
We provide an empirical demonstration on four classical domains that our
algorithm, HC-Dyna, can obtain significant sample efficiency improvements. We
study the properties of different sampling distributions for search-control,

paper, we introduced several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models that
take unstructured gene expression inputs to classify tumor and non-tumor
samples into their designated cancer types or as normal. Based on different
designs of gene embeddings and convolution schemes, we implemented three CNN
models: 1D-CNN, 2D-Vanilla-CNN, and 2D-Hybrid-CNN. The models were trained and
tested on combined 10,340 samples of 33 cancer types and 731 matched normal
tissues of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our models achieved excellent
prediction accuracies (93.9-95.0%) among 34 classes (33 cancers and normal).
Furthermore, we interpreted one of the models, known as 1D-CNN model, with a
guided saliency technique and identified a total of 2,090 cancer markers (108
per class). The concordance of differential expression of these markers between
the cancer type they represent and others is confirmed. In breast cancer, for
instance, our model identified well-known markers, such as GATA3 and ESR1.
Finally, we extended the 1D-CNN model for prediction of breast cancer subtypes

Characterizing uncertainty in the Lie Algebra of the special Euclidean group
results in better uncertainty estimates. However, existing approaches assume
that individual poses are independent. Since factors in a pose graph induce
correlation, this independence assumption is usually not reflected in reality.
In addition, prior work has focused primarily on the pose composition
operation. This paper develops a framework for modeling the uncertainty of
jointly distributed poses and describes how to perform the equivalent of the
SSC pose operations while characterizing uncertainty in the Lie Algebra.
Evaluation on simulated and open-source datasets shows that the proposed

  confounder adjustments","20 pages, 5 figure",,,,"stat.AP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the integrative analyses of omics data, it is often of interest to extract
data representation from one data type that best reflect its relations with
another data type. This task is traditionally fulfilled by linear methods such
as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and partial least squares (PLS).
However, information contained in one data type pertaining to the other data
type may be complex and in nonlinear form. Deep learning provides a convenient
alternative to extract low-dimensional nonlinear data embedding. In addition,
the deep learning setup can naturally incorporate the effects of clinical
confounding factors into the integrative analysis. Here we report a deep
learning setup, named Autoencoder-based Integrative Multi-omics data Embedding
(AIME), to extract data representation for omics data integrative analysis. The
method can adjust for confounder variables, achieve informative data embedding,
rank features in terms of their contributions, and find pairs of features from
the two data types that are related to each other through the data embedding.
In simulation studies, the method was highly effective in the extraction of
major contributing features between data types. Using a real microRNA-gene
expression dataset, and a real DNA methylation-gene expression dataset, we show
that AIME excluded the influence of confounders including batch effects, and
extracted biologically plausible novel information. The R package based on
Keras and the TensorFlow backend is available at

less light and have fewer optical components, resulting in pixelation artifacts

supervised methods known as super resolution have achieved considerable success
in restoring low resolution images by generating the missing high frequency
details. In this work, we propose a novel attention mechanism that, for the
first time, combines 1st- and 2nd-order statistics for pooling operation, in
the spatial and channel-wise dimensions. We compare the efficacy of our method
to 11 other existing single image super resolution techniques that compensate
for the reduction in image quality caused by the necessity of endomicroscope
miniaturization. All evaluations are carried out on three publicly available
datasets. Experimental results show that our method can produce competitive
results against state-of-the-art in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and IFC metrics.
Additionally, our proposed method contains small number of parameters, which

reinforcement learning in general. From small, tabular settings such as
gridworlds to large, continuous and sparse reward settings such as robotic
object manipulation tasks, exploration through adding an uncertainty bonus to
the reward function has been shown to be effective when the uncertainty is able
to accurately drive exploration towards promising states. However reward
bonuses can still be inefficient since they are non-stationary, which means
that we must wait for function approximators to catch up and converge again
when uncertainties change. We propose the idea of directed exploration, that is
learning a goal-conditioned policy where goals are simply other states, and
using that to directly try to reach states with large uncertainty. The
goal-conditioned policy is independent of uncertainty and is thus stationary.
We show in our experiments how directed exploration is more efficient at
exploration and more robust to how the uncertainty is computed than adding

taken into account when probing spatially extended molecules on a decoupling
layer. To this end, oligothiophene-based molecules were deposited on a
monolayer of molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) on a Au(111) surface. By probing
the delocalized molecular orbital along the thiophene-backbone, we found an
apparent intramolecular shift of the positive ion resonance, which can be
ascribed to a perturbation potential caused by the tip. Using a simple model
for the electrostatic landscape, we show that such a perturbation is caused by
the inhomogeneity of the applied bias potential in the junction and may be
further modified by an electric dipole of a functionalized tip. The two effects
can be disentangled in tunneling spectra by probing the apparent energy shift
of vibronic resonances along the molecular backbone. We suggest that extended

a display backplane. We determine the protocols required to achieve continuous
liquid coverage of the entire pixel area for the case where equally-spaced
fluid droplets are sequentially printed along a straight line within a
stadium-shaped pixel, and explore how these protocols depend on the wetting

redistribution via capillary spreading according to a Cox-Voinov law. We show
that the model is able to predict quantitatively the evolution of the liquid

determine efficient printing strategies that account for uncertainties arising
from imperfect substrate preparation or printhead dysfunction.

dissipation theorem and Hedin's equations, respectively. Various different
xc-kernels, which are all rooted in the homogeneous electron gas, are
introduced but hereafter we focus on the specific class of renormalized
adiabatic kernels, in particular the rALDA and rAPBE. The kernels drastically
improve the description of short-range correlations as compared to the random
phase approximation (RPA), resulting in significantly better correlation
energies. This effect greatly reduces the reliance on error cancellations,
which is essential in RPA, and systematically improves covalent bond energies
while preserving the good performance of the RPA for dispersive interactions.
For quasiparticle energies, the xc-kernels account for vertex corrections that
are missing in the GW self-energy. In this context, we show that the
short-range correlations mainly correct the absolute band positions while the
band gap is less affected in agreement with the known good performance of GW
for the latter. The renormalized xc-kernels offer a rigorous extension of the
RPA and GW methods with clear improvements in terms of accuracy at little extra
computational cost.

localize electromagnetic waves in unique ways. The inverse design of these
devices is a non-convex optimization problem in a high dimensional space,
making global optimization a major challenge. We present a new type of
population-based global optimization algorithm for metasurfaces that is enabled
by the training of a generative neural network. The loss function used for
backpropagation depends on the generated pattern layouts, their efficiencies,
and efficiency gradients, which are calculated by the adjoint variables method
using forward and adjoint electromagnetic simulations. We observe that the
distribution of devices generated by the network continuously shifts towards
high performance design space regions over the course of optimization. Upon
training completion, the best generated devices have efficiencies comparable to
or exceeding the best devices designed using standard topology optimization.
Our proposed global optimization algorithm can generally apply to other
gradient-based optimization problems in optics, mechanics and electronics.

mathematical expression that best fits a numerical dataset. It is a global
optimization problem. The most popular approach to SR is by genetic programming
(SRGP). It is a common paradigm to compare an algorithm's performance to that
of random search, but the data comparing SRGP to random search is lacking. We
describe a novel algorithm for SR, namely SR by uniform random global search
(SRURGS), also known as pure random search. We conduct experiments comparing
SRURGS with SRGP using 100 randomly generated equations. Our results suggest
that a SRGP is faster than SRURGS in producing equations with good R^2 for
simple problems. However, our experiments suggest that SRURGS is more robust
than SRGP, able to produce good output in more challenging problems. As SRURGS
is arguably the simplest global search algorithm, we believe it should serve as
a control algorithm against which other symbolic regression algorithms are
compared. SRURGS has only one tuning parameter, and is conceptually very
simple, making it a useful tool in solving SR problems. The method produces
random equations, which is useful for the generation of symbolic regression
benchmark problems. We have released well documented and open-source python
code, currently under formal peer-review, so that interested researchers can
deploy the tool in practice.

encrypting sensitive user data. The recently revealed strikes of ransomware
attacks have already resulted in significant economic losses and societal harm
across different sectors, ranging from local governments to health care.
  Most modern ransomware use Bitcoin for payments. However, although Bitcoin
transactions are permanently recorded and publicly available, current
approaches for detecting ransomware depend only on a couple of heuristics
and/or tedious information gathering steps (e.g., running ransomware to collect
ransomware related Bitcoin addresses). To our knowledge, none of the previous
approaches have employed advanced data analytics techniques to automatically
detect ransomware related transactions and malicious Bitcoin addresses.
  By capitalizing on the recent advances in topological data analysis, we
propose an efficient and tractable data analytics framework to automatically
detect new malicious addresses in a ransomware family, given only a limited
records of previous transactions. Furthermore, our proposed techniques exhibit
high utility to detect the emergence of new ransomware families, that is,
ransomware with no previous records of transactions. Using the existing known
ransomware data sets, we show that our proposed methodology provides
significant improvements in precision and recall for ransomware transaction
detection, compared to existing heuristic based approaches, and can be utilized
to automate ransomware detection.

believed that a supernova fallback disk is required to spin down the neutron
star to the current spin period within a few $10^3$ yr. The mass of the
fallback disk around newborn neutron stars can provide useful information on
the supernova processes and the possible detection limit with optical/infrared
observations. However, it is controversial how massive the disk is in the case
of 1E 161348$-$5055. In this work we simulate the spin evolution of a magnetar
that is driven by the interaction between the disk and the star's magnetic
field. Compared with previous studies, we take into account various critical

infinite-horizon average-reward continuous-time Markov decision process (CTMDP)

resource control is the curse-of-dimensionality problem, where the state space
of the MDP model and the computation complexity increase exponentially with the

semi-distributed auction-based implementation, where the IoT devices submit

learning system. For example, learning many auxiliary value functions, in
addition to optimizing the environmental reward, appears to improve both
exploration and representation learning. The question we tackle in this paper
is how to sculpt the stream of experience---how to adapt the learning system's
behavior---to optimize the learning of a collection of value functions. A
simple answer is to compute an intrinsic reward based on the statistics of each
auxiliary learner, and use reinforcement learning to maximize that intrinsic
reward. Unfortunately, implementing this simple idea has proven difficult, and
thus has been the focus of decades of study. It remains unclear which of the
many possible measures of learning would work well in a parallel learning
setting where environmental reward is extremely sparse or absent. In this
paper, we investigate and compare different intrinsic reward mechanisms in a
new bandit-like parallel-learning testbed. We discuss the interaction between
reward and prediction learners and highlight the importance of introspective
prediction learners: those that increase their rate of learning when progress
is possible, and decrease when it is not. We provide a comprehensive empirical
comparison of 14 different rewards, including well-known ideas from
reinforcement learning and active learning. Our results highlight a simple but
seemingly powerful principle: intrinsic rewards based on the amount of learning
can generate useful behavior, if each individual learner is introspective.

Despite the popularity of HLAMs, the fundamental identifiability issue remains

Motivated by this fact, a differentiable mesh renderer with analytical
gradients is proposed. The main obstacle of rasterization based rendering being
differentiable is the discrete sampling operation. To make the rasterization
differentiable, the pixel intensity is defined as a double integral over the
pixel area and the integral is approximated by anti-aliasing with an average
filter. Then the analytical gradients with respect to the vertices coordinates
can be derived from the continuous definition of pixel intensity. To
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed differentiable
renderer, experiments of 3D pose estimation by only multi-viewpoint silhouettes
were conducted. The experimental results show that 3D pose estimation without
3D and 2D joints supervision is capable of producing competitive results both
qualitatively and quantitatively. The experimental results also show that the

semantic segmentation of indoor scenes. Unlike existing methods that require
recording a video using a color camera and/or a depth camera, our method only
needs a small number of (e.g., 3-5) color images from uncalibrated sparse views
as input, which greatly simplifies data acquisition and extends applicable
scenarios. Since different views have limited overlaps, our method allows a
single image as input to discern the depth and semantic information of the
scene. The key issue is how to recover relatively accurate depth from single
images and reconstruct a 3D scene by fusing very few depth maps. To address
this problem, we first design an iterative deep architecture, IterNet, that
estimates depth and semantic segmentation alternately, so that they benefit
each other. To deal with the little overlap and non-rigid transformation
between views, we further propose a joint global and local registration method
to reconstruct a 3D scene with semantic information from sparse views. We also
make available a new indoor synthetic dataset simultaneously providing
photorealistic high-resolution RGB images, accurate depth maps and pixel-level
semantic labels for thousands of complex layouts, useful for training and
evaluation. Experimental results on public datasets and our dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves more accurate depth estimation, smaller semantic
segmentation errors and better 3D reconstruction results, compared with
state-of-the-art methods.

and fractional boundary charges in graphene nanoribbons is presented. Graphene
nanoribbons and polyacetylene have chiral symmetry and share numerous similar
properties, e.g., the bulk-edge correspondence between the Zak phase and the
existence of edge states, along with the presence of chiral boundary states,
which are important for charge fractionalization. In polyacetylene, a fermion
mass potential in the Dirac equation produces an excitation gap, and a twist in
this scalar potential produces a zero-energy chiral soliton. Similarly, in a
gapful armchair graphene nanoribbon, a distortion in the chiral gauge field can
produce soliton states. In polyacetylene, a soliton is bound to a domain wall
connecting two different dimerized phases. In graphene nanoribbons, a
domain-wall soliton connects two topological zigzag edges with different
chiralities. However, such a soliton does not display spin-charge separation.
The existence of a soliton in finite-length polyacetylene can induce formation
of fractional charges on the opposite ends. In contrast, for gapful graphene
nanoribbons, the antiferromagnetic coupling between the opposite zigzag edges
induces integer boundary charges. The presence of disorder in graphene
nanoribbons partly mitigates antiferromagnetic coupling effect. Hence, the
average edge charge of gap states with energies within a small interval is e/2,
with significant charge fluctuations. However, midgap states exhibit a
well-defined charge fractionalization between the opposite zigzag edges in the
weak-disorder regime. Numerous occupied soliton states in a disorder-free and
doped zigzag graphene nanoribbon form a solitonic phase.

of the effects of albedo and disc on the zero velocity curves, existence of
equilibrium points and on their linear stability in a generalized restricted
three body problem that consists of motion of an infinitesimal mass under the
uniform gravity field of radiating-oblate primary, oblate secondary and a disc,
which is rotating about the common center of the mass of the system. A
significant effect of albedo and disc are observed on the zero velocity curves,
positions of equilibrium points and on the stability region. Linear stability
analysis of collinear equilibrium points is performed with respect to mass
ratio $\mu$ and albedo parameter of secondary, separately and it is found that
these are unstable in both the cases. On the other hand, non-collinear
equilibrium point is stable in a certain range of mass ratio. After analyzing
individual as well as combined effect of radiation pressure force of the
primary, albedo of secondary, oblateness of both the massive bodies and the
disc, it is found that these perturbations play a significant on the motion of
infinitesimal mass in the vicinity of equilibrium points. These results may be
help to analyze more generalized problem of few bodies under the influence of
different kind of perturbations such as P-R drag, solar wind drag etc. Present
study is limited to the regular symmetric disc which will extend later.

being used to automate the discovery of physics principles and governing

law from data is challenging without simultaneously proposing an accompanying
discrepancy model to account for the inevitable mismatch between theory and
measurements. By revisiting the classic problem of modeling falling objects of
different size and mass, we highlight a number of nuanced issues that must be
addressed by modern data-driven methods for automated physics discovery.
Specifically, we show that measurement noise and complex secondary physical
mechanisms, like unsteady fluid drag forces, can obscure the underlying law of
gravitation, leading to an erroneous model. We use the sparse identification of
nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method to identify governing equations for
real-world measurement data and simulated trajectories. Incorporating into
SINDy the assumption that each falling object is governed by a similar physical
law is shown to improve the robustness of the learned models, but discrepancies
between the predictions and observations persist due to subtleties in drag
dynamics. This work highlights the fact that the naive application of ML/AI
will generally be insufficient to infer universal physical laws without further

From Gaussian decomposition of the H$\beta$ profile we calculated the black

fraction of contribution of the non-stellar continuum to the total flux of
0.64. We determined black hole masses in the range of log(M$_{BH}$/M$_{\odot}$)

of SKA-low (SKA1-low) can constrain the properties of the unseen galaxies
driving the astrophysics of the EoR and CD. We consider three observing
strategies: (i) deep (1000h on a single field); (ii) medium-deep (100hr on 10
independent fields); and (iii) shallow (10hr on 100 independent fields). Using
the 21-cm power spectrum as a summary statistic, and conservatively only using
the 21-cm signal above the foreground wedge, we predict that all three
observing strategies should recover astrophysical parameters to a fractional
precision of $\sim 0.1$ -- 10 per cent. The reionisation history is recovered
to an uncertainty of $\Delta z \lesssim 0.1$ (1$\sigma$) for the bulk of its
duration. The medium-deep strategy, balancing thermal noise against cosmic
variance, results in the tightest constraints, slightly outperforming the deep
strategy. The shallow observational strategy performs the worst, with up to a
$\sim 10$ -- 60 per cent increase in the recovered uncertainty. We note,
however, that non-Gaussian summary statistics, tomography, as well as unbiased
foreground removal would likely favour the deep strategy.

However, AGNs in our low $M_*$ subsample are found in more massive halos than
non-active galaxies. By excluding AGNs in galaxy groups from the clustering

and energy demanding for modern computer systems. In this paper, we propose
Virtual Pooling (ViP), a model-level approach to improve speed and energy

a provable error bound. We show the efficacy of ViP through experiments on four
CNN models, three representative datasets, both desktop and mobile platforms,
and two visual learning tasks, i.e., image classification and object detection.
For example, ViP delivers 2.1x speedup with less than 1.5% accuracy degradation
in ImageNet classification on VGG-16, and 1.8x speedup with 0.025 mAP
degradation in PASCAL VOC object detection with Faster-RCNN. ViP also reduces
mobile GPU and CPU energy consumption by up to 55% and 70%, respectively. As a
complementary method to existing acceleration approaches, ViP achieves 1.9x
speedup on ThiNet leading to a combined speedup of 5.23x on VGG-16.
Furthermore, ViP provides a knob for machine learning practitioners to generate
a set of CNN models with varying trade-offs between system speed/energy
consumption and accuracy to better accommodate the requirements of their tasks.

based on a multi-phase SPH method. A set of physics-motivated modeling
equations are developed to achieve the targets of domain decomposition,
communication volume optimization and high-quality unstructured mesh generation
simultaneously. A unified density field is defined as the target function for
both partitioning the geometry and distributing the mesh-vertexes. A
multi-phase Smoothing Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method is employed to solve
the governing equations. All the optimization targets are achieved implicitly
and consistently by the particle relaxation procedure without constructing
triangulation/tetrahedralization explicitly. The target of communication
reduction is achieved by introducing a surface tension model between distinct
partitioning sub-domains, which are characterized by colored SPH particles. The
resulting partitioning diagram features physically localized sub-domains and
optimized interface communication. The target of optimizing the mesh quality is
achieved by introducing a tailored equation-of-state (EOS) and a smooth
isotropic kernel function. The mesh quality near the interface of neighboring
sub-domains is improved by gradually removing the surface-tension force once a
steady state is achieved. The proposed method is developed basing on a new
parallel environment for multi-resolution SPH to exploit both coarse- and
fine-grained parallelism. A set of benchmarks are conducted to verify that all
the optimization targets are achieved consistently within the current
framework.

shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples which are manipulated
instances targeting to mislead DNNs to make incorrect predictions. Currently,
most such adversarial examples try to guarantee ""subtle perturbation"" by
limiting the $L_p$ norm of the perturbation. In this paper, we aim to explore
the impact of semantic manipulation on DNNs predictions by manipulating the
semantic attributes of images and generate ""unrestricted adversarial examples"".
  In particular, we propose an algorithm \emph{SemanticAdv} which leverages
disentangled semantic factors to generate adversarial perturbation by altering
controlled semantic attributes to fool the learner towards various
""adversarial"" targets. We conduct extensive experiments to show that the
semantic based adversarial examples can not only fool different learning tasks
such as face verification and landmark detection, but also achieve high
targeted attack success rate against \emph{real-world black-box} services such
as Azure face verification service based on transferability.
  To further demonstrate the applicability of \emph{SemanticAdv} beyond face
recognition domain, we also generate semantic perturbations on street-view
images. Such adversarial examples with controlled semantic manipulation can
shed light on further understanding about vulnerabilities of DNNs as well as
potential defensive approaches.

instability scale as $\sigma \propto B^{3/4}\eta^{1/4}$ with the field strength
$B$ and magnetic diffusivity $\eta$ and can be large compared to the rate of
resistive decay of the background field. The instability deviates the magnetic
field from the force-free configuration. The unstable eigenmodes include a fine
spatial structure which evolves into current sheets at the nonlinear stage of
the instability. The instability catalyses the resistive release of magnetic
energy. The energy is released in a sequence of spikes, every spike emits
several percent of the total energy. A numerically defined scaling for the
energy released in a single spike permits an extrapolation to astrophysically
relevant values of the Hall number. The instability can be relevant to magnetic
energy release in a neutron star crust and, possibly, in stellar coronae.

First, using the mountain pass theorem, a nonnegative solution is obtained when
$f$ satisfies exponential growth conditions and $\lambda$ is large enough, and
we prove that the solution converges to zero in $W_V^{s,N/s}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ as
$\lambda\rightarrow\infty$. Then, using the Ekeland variational principle, a
nonnegative nontrivial solution is obtained when $\lambda$ is small enough, and
we show that the solution converges to zero in $W_V^{s,N/s}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ as
$\lambda\rightarrow0$. Furthermore, using the genus theory, infinitely many
solutions are obtained when $M$ is a special function and $\lambda$ is small
enough. We note that our paper covers a novel feature of Kirchhoff problems,
that is, the Kirchhoff function $M(0)=0$.

two-pronged. In the first, we solve the central SJ eigenvalue problem
explicitly in the small mass regime, upto order (mL)^4. This allows us to
formally construct the SJ Wightman function up to this order. Using a
combination of analytic and numerical methods, we obtain expressions for the SJ
Wightman function both in the center and the corner of the diamond, to leading
order. We find that in the center, it is more like the massless Minkowski
Wightman function than the massive one, while in the corner it corresponds to
that of the massive mirror. In the second part, in order to explore larger
masses, we perform numerical simulations using a causal set approximated by a
flat 2D causal diamond. We find that in the center of the diamond the causal
set SJ Wightman function resembles the massless Minkowski Wightman function for
small masses, as in the continuum, but beyond a critical value it resembles the
massive Minkowski Wightman function as expected. Our calculations suggest that
unlike the massive Minkowski vacuum, the SJ vacuum has a well-defined massless
limit, which mimics the behavior of the Pauli Jordan function underlying the SJ
construction. In the corner of the diamond, moreover, it agrees with the mirror

delayed recognition show a stronger and longer technical impact than instant
recognition papers. We provide indication that in the more recent years papers

be increased considerably by a number of processes, including photoevaporative
and particle drift. MHD disc models also suggest the existence of a dead-zone
at $R\lesssim 10$ AU, where the regions close to the midplane remain laminar.
In this context, we use two-fluid hydrodynamical simulations to study the
interaction between a low-mass planet ($\sim 1.7 \;{\rm M_\oplus}$) on a fixed
orbit and an inviscid pebble-rich disc with solid-to-gas ratio $\epsilon\ge
0.5$. For pebbles with Stokes numbers St=0.1, 0.5, multiple dusty vortices are
formed through the Rossby Wave Instability at the planet separatrix. Effects
due to gas drag then lead to a strong enhancement in the solid-to-gas ratio,
which can increase by a factor of $\sim 10^3$ for marginally coupled particles
with St=0.5. As in streaming instabilities, pebble clumps reorganize into
filaments that may plausibly collapse to form planetesimals. When the planet is
allowed to migrate in a MMSN disc, the vortex instability is delayed due to
migration but sets in once inward migration stops due a strong positive pebble
torque. Again, particle filaments evolving in a gap are formed in the disc
while the planet undergoes an episode of outward migration. Our results suggest
that vortex instabilities triggered by low-mass planets could play an important
role in forming planetesimals in pebble-rich, inviscid discs, and may
significantly modify the migration of low-mass planets. They also imply that
planetary dust gaps may not necessarily contain planets if these migrated away.

to a force probe via polymer linkers, and the total extension -- of molecule

experiment at constant force, the total extension jumps between two values that
correspond to the folded and unfolded states of the molecule. For several
biomolecular systems the committor, which is the probability to fold starting
from a given extension, has been used to extract the molecular activation
barrier (a technique known as ""committor inversion""). In this work, we study
the influence of the force probe, which is much larger than the molecule being
measured, on the activation barrier obtained by committor inversion. We use a
two-dimensional framework in which the diffusion coefficient of the molecule
and of the pulling device can differ. We systematically study the free energy
profile along the total extension obtained from the committor, by numerically
solving the Onsager equation and using Brownian dynamics simulations. We
analyze the dependence of the extracted barrier on the linker stiffness,
molecular barrier height, and diffusion anisotropy, and thus, establish the
range of validity of committor inversion. Along the way, we showcase the
committor of 2-dimensional diffusive models and illustrate how it is affected

generating this bimodal directional wave field is resonant propagation as
suggested by Phillips resonance theory of wind wave generation. For a more
mature wave field, wave components shorter than the peak wavelength also show
bimodal directional distributions symmetric to the dominant wave direction. The
latter bimodal directionality is produced by Hasselmann nonlinear wave-wave
interaction mechanism. The implications of these directional observations on
remote sensing (directional characteristics of ocean surface roughness) and
air-sea interaction studies (directional properties of mass, momentum and
energy transfers) are significant.

Galactic bulge, the central two degrees have been relatively unexplored due to
the heavy and variable interstellar extinction, extreme stellar crowding, and
the presence of complex foreground disk stellar populations. In this paper we
discuss the metallicity distribution function, vertical and radial gradients
and chemical abundances of $\alpha$-elements in the inner two degrees of the
Milky Way, as obtained by recent IR spectroscopic surveys. We use a compilation
of recent measurements of metallicities and $\alpha$-element abundances derived
from medium-high resolution spectroscopy. We compare these metallicities with
low-resolution studies.
  Defining ""metal-rich"" as stars with $ \rm [Fe/H]>0$, and ""metal-poor"" as
stars with $\rm [Fe/H]<0$, we find compelling evidence for a higher fraction
($\sim 80\%$) of metal-rich stars in the Galactic Center (GC) compared to the
values (50-60\%) measured in the low latitude fields within the innermost 600
pc. The high fraction of metal-rich stars in the GC region implies a very high
mean metallicity of +0.2 dex, while in the inner 600 pc of the bulge the mean
metallicity is rather homogenous around the solar value. A vertical metallicity
gradient of -0.27 dex/kpc in the inner 600 pc is only measured if the GC is
included, otherwise the distribution is about flat and consistent with no
vertical gradient. In addition to its high stellar density, the Galactic
center/nuclear star cluster is also extreme in hosting high stellar abundances,
compared to the surrounding inner bulge stellar populations; this has
implications for formation scenarios and strengthens the case for the NSC being
a distinct stellar system.

of the amplification of local approximation errors. We address this by
proposing an algorithm that adaptively switches between TD and MC in each

learned confidence intervals that detect biases of TD estimates. We demonstrate
in a variety of policy evaluation tasks that this simple adaptive algorithm

fusion in a sensor network in which multi-Bernoulli (MB) filters are locally
running in every sensor node for multi-target tracking. The generalized
Covariance Intersection (GCI) fusion rule is employed to fuse multiple MB
random finite set densities. The fused density comprises a set of fusion
hypotheses that grow exponentially with the number of Bernoulli components.
Thus, GCI fusion with MB filters can become computationally intractable in
practical applications that involve tracking of even a moderate number of
objects. In order to accelerate the multi-sensor fusion procedure, we derive a
theoretically sound approximation to the fused density. The number of fusion
hypotheses in the resulting density is significantly smaller than the original
fused density. It also has a parallelizable structure that allows multiple
clusters of Bernoulli components to be fused independently. By carefully
clustering Bernoulli components into isolated clusters using the GCI divergence
as the distance metric, we propose an alternative to build exactly the
approximated density without exhaustively computing all the fusion hypotheses.
The combination of the proposed approximation technique and the fast clustering
algorithm can enable a novel and fast GCIMB fusion implementation. Our analysis
shows that the proposed fusion method can dramatically reduce the computational
and memory requirements with small bounded L1-error. The Gaussian mixture
implementation of the proposed method is also presented. In various numerical
experiments, including a challenging scenario with up to forty objects, the
efficacy of the proposed fusion method is demonstrated.

remains an unnatural topic for many software engineering researchers. Poor
research ethics may lead to mistrust of research results, lost funding and
retraction of publications. A core principle for research ethics is
confidentiality, and anonymization is a standard approach to guarantee it. Many
guidelines for qualitative software engineering research, and for qualitative
research in general, exist, but these do not penetrate how and why to anonymize
interview data. Aims: In this paper we aim to identify ethical guidelines for
software engineering interview studies involving industrial practitioners.
Method: By learning from previous experiences and listening to the authority of
existing guidelines in the more mature field of medicine as well as in software
engineering, a comprehensive set of checklists for interview studies was
distilled. Results: The elements of an interview study were identified and
ethical considerations and recommendations for each step were produced, in
particular with respect to anonymization. Important ethical principles are:
consent, beneficence, confidentiality, scientific value, researcher skill,
justice, respect for law, and ethical reviews. Conclusions: The most important
contribution of this study is the set of checklists for ethical interview
studies. Future work is needed to refine these guidelines with respect to legal
aspects and ethical boards.

range is of great interest to ocean remote sensing and studies of ocean surface
processes including the surface roughness, air-sea energy and momentum
exchanges, wave breaking, and whitecap coverage. For more than six decades, the
cmDm wave components are generally considered to be in the equilibrium range,
and its spectral function has a constant slope: -5 or -4 in the 1D frequency
spectrum, and -3 or -2.5 in the 1D wavenumber spectrum. Some variations of the
equilibrium spectrum models include varying the frequency spectral slope from 4
to 5 at some multiple of the spectral peak frequency, or incorporating a
threshold velocity in the reference wind speed. Extensive efforts are then
devoted to quantifying the spectral coefficient of the equilibrium spectrum
function. The observed wind wave spectral slopes in the ocean environment,
however, are rarely constant. The variable spectral slope is indicative of the
nonequilibrium nature of surface wind waves in the field. As a result the wave
properties in field observations are significantly different from those
inferred from assuming a constant spectral slope. From signal-to-noise
consideration the surface slope measurements are much more sensitive than the
elevation data for the study of cmDm waves. Recently, several large datasets of
low-pass-filtered mean square slope (LPMSS) have been reported in support of
the Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSSR) tropical cyclone
wind sensing effort. Combining the LPMSS observations with a spectrum model
that accommodates a variable spectral slope, this paper seeks to quantify the
connection between the variable spectral slope and the spectral properties of
cmDm waves.

of gravitational waves from the merger of ten stellar mass binary black holes
and a neutron star binary. This paper reports on the all-sky search for
gravitational waves from intermediate mass black hole binaries in the first and
second observing runs of the Advanced LIGO and Virgo network. The search uses
three independent algorithms: two based on matched filtering of the data with
waveform templates of gravitational wave signals from compact binaries, and a
third, model-independent algorithm that employs no signal model for the
incoming signal. No intermediate mass black hole binary event was detected in
this search. Consequently, we place upper limits on the merger rate density for
a family of intermediate mass black hole binaries. In particular, we choose
sources with total masses $M=m_1+m_2\in[120,800]$M$_\odot$ and mass ratios $q =
m_2/m_1 \in[0.1,1.0]$. For the first time, this calculation is done using
numerical relativity waveforms (which include higher modes) as models of the
real emitted signal. We place a most stringent upper limit of
$0.20$~Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ (in co-moving units at the 90% confidence level) for
equal-mass binaries with individual masses $m_{1,2}=100$M$_\odot$ and
dimensionless spins $\chi_{1,2}= 0.8$ aligned with the orbital angular momentum
of the binary. This improves by a factor of $\sim 5$ that reported after
Advanced LIGO's first observing run.

better constrained due to Juno's high-precision measurements. The recently
published gravity and magnetic field measurements have led to new information
regarding the planet and its internal flows, and future magnetic measurements
will allow taking another step in resolving this puzzle. In this study, we
propose a new method to better constrain Jupiter's internal flow field using
the Juno gravity measurements combined with the expected measurements of
magnetic secular variation. Based on a combination of hydrodynamical and
magnetic field considerations we show that an optimized vertical profile of the
zonal flows that fits both measurements can be obtained. Incorporating the
magnetic field effects on the flow better constraints the flow decay profile.
This will allow getting closer to answering the long-lived question regarding
the depth and nature of the flows on Jupiter.

switches in code-mixed utterances. This task can be achieved by using a CS
automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can handle such language
switches. In our previous work, we have investigated the code-switching
detection performance of the Frisian-Dutch CS ASR system by using the time
alignment of the most likely hypothesis and found that this technique suffers
from over-switching due to numerous very short spurious language switches. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for CS detection aiming to remedy this
shortcoming by using the language posteriors which are the sum of the
frame-level posteriors of phones belonging to the same language. The CS
ASR-generated language posteriors contain more complete language-specific
information on frame level compared to the time alignment of the ASR output.
Hence, it is expected to yield more accurate and robust CS detection. The CS
detection experiments demonstrate that the proposed language posterior-based
approach provides higher detection accuracy than the baseline system in terms
of equal error rate. Moreover, a detailed CS detection error analysis reveals
that using language posteriors reduces the false alarms and results in more
robust CS detection.

first-generation fermion masses via suppressed $Z_2$ breaking effects. From a
di-jet +MET analysis at the LHC, we find rather loose bounds on the effective

of German physicists and historians derived from common origins. The concept of
fact became part of the German language remarkably late. It gained momentum
only toward the end of the eighteenth century. I show that the concept of fact
emerged as part of a historical knowledge tradition, which comprised both human
and natural empirical study. Around 1800, parts of this tradition, including
the concept of fact, were integrated into the epistemological basis of several
emerging disciplines, including physics and historiography. During this process
of discipline formation, the concept of fact remained fluid. I reveal this
fluidity by unearthing different interpretations and roles of facts in
different German contexts around 1800. I demonstrate how a fact-based
epistemology emerged at the University of G\""ottingen in the late eighteenth
century, by focusing on universal historian August Ludwig Schl\""ozer and the
experimentalist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. In a time of scientific and
political revolutions, they regarded facts as eternal knowledge, contrasting
them with short-lived theories and speculations. Remarkably, Schl\""ozer and
Lichtenberg construed facts as the basis of Wissenschaft, but not as
Wissenschaft itself. Only after 1800, empirically minded German physicists and
historians granted facts self-contained value. As physics and historiography
became institutionalized at German universities, the concept of fact acquired
different interpretations in different disciplinary settings. These related to
fact-oriented research practices, such as precision measurement in physics and
source criticism in historiography.

Constant solar metallicity models are not able to simultaneously reproduce the

energy due to $^{22}$Ne sedimentation piles up more objects in brighter bins of
the faint end of the luminosity function. The contribution of a single burst

centered around $M_{\rm bol}=15.75$. Among the metallicity models studied, the
one following a Twarog's profile is disposable. Our best fit model was obtained
when a dispersion in metallicities around the solar metallicity value is
considered along with a $^{22}$Ne sedimentation model, a thick disk
contribution and an age of the thin disk of $8.8\pm0.2$ Gyr. Our population
synthesis model is able to reproduce the local white dwarf luminosity function
with a high degree of precision when a dispersion in metallicities around the

scientific fields to benefit from the routine creation of detailed 3D models.
However, for a large number of applications, only a single camera is available,
due to cost or space constraints in the survey platforms. Monocular
structure-from-motion raises the issue of properly estimating the scale of the
3D models, in order to later use those models for metrology. The scale can be
determined from the presence of visible objects of known dimensions, or from
information on the magnitude of the camera motion provided by other sensors,
such as GPS.
  This paper addresses the problem of accurately scaling 3D models created from
monocular cameras in GPS-denied environments, such as in underwater
applications. Motivated by the common availability of underwater laser scalers,
we present two novel approaches. A fully-calibrated method enables the use of
arbitrary laser setups, while a partially-calibrated method reduces the need
for calibration by only assuming parallelism on the laser beams, with no
constraints on the camera. The proposed methods have several advantages with
respect to the existing methods. The need for laser alignment with the optical
axis of the camera is removed, together with the extremely error-prone manual
identification of image points on the 3D model.
  The performance of the methods and their applicability was evaluated on both
data generated from a realistic 3D model and data collected during an
oceanographic cruise in 2017. Three separate laser configurations have been
tested, encompassing nearly all possible laser setups, to evaluate the effects
of terrain roughness, noise, camera perspective angle and camera-scene
distance. In the real scenario, the computation of 6 independent model scale
estimates using our fully-calibrated approach, produced values with standard

locomotion expenditures of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). These models are
used to formulate a novel nonlinear optimal control problem (OCP) for arbitrary
networks of autonomous agents. This is the first work to consider mobility as a
decision variable in UAV networks with multiple access channels. Where
possible, we compare our results with known analytic solutions for particular
single-hop network configurations. The OCP is then applied to a multiple-node
UAV network for which previous results cannot be readily extended. Numerical

upwards of 70% when compared to more naive communication policies.

$h\rightarrow \infty$, depending on how the weights of the last layer scale
with $h$. In the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) limit, the dynamics becomes linear
in the weights and is described by a frozen kernel $\Theta$. By contrast, in
the Mean-Field limit, the dynamics can be expressed in terms of the
distribution of the parameters associated with a neuron, that follows a partial
differential equation. In this work we consider deep networks where the weights
in the last layer scale as $\alpha h^{-1/2}$ at initialization. By varying
$\alpha$ and $h$, we probe the crossover between the two limits. We observe the
previously identified regimes of lazy training and feature training. In the
lazy-training regime, the dynamics is almost linear and the NTK barely changes
after initialization. The feature-training regime includes the mean-field
formulation as a limiting case and is characterized by a kernel that evolves in
time, and learns some features. We perform numerical experiments on MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST and CIFAR10 and consider various architectures. We find
that (i) The two regimes are separated by an $\alpha^*$ that scales as
$h^{-1/2}$. (ii) Network architecture and data structure play an important role
in determining which regime is better: in our tests, fully-connected networks
perform generally better in the lazy-training regime, unlike convolutional
networks. (iii) In both regimes, the fluctuations $\delta F$ induced on the
learned function by initial conditions decay as $\delta F\sim 1/\sqrt{h}$,
leading to a performance that increases with $h$. The same improvement can also
be obtained at an intermediate width by ensemble-averaging several networks.
(iv) In the feature-training regime we identify a time scale
$t_1\sim\sqrt{h}\alpha$, such that for $t\ll t_1$ the dynamics is linear.

significant modulating optical depth of the iron K-edge is detected for Vela

with poor statistical significance. The observed iron K-edge exhibits a maximum
optical depth, when the X-ray continuum dims, and there is no significant pulse

optical depth with pulse phase can be explained as being due to the accreting
matter captured by the magnetic field lines of the pulsar, which co-rotates

data: the Gaussian graphical interaction model (GGIM). The development of this
model comes from considering stationary Gaussian processes on graphs, and
leveraging the equations between the resulting steady-state covariance matrix
and the Laplacian matrix representing the interaction graph. Through the
presentation of conceptually straightforward theory, we develop the new model
and provide interpretations of the edges in the graphical model in terms of
statistical measures. We show that when restricted to undirected graphs, the
Laplacian matrix representing a GGIM is equivalent to the standard inverse
covariance matrix that encodes conditional dependence relationships.
Furthermore, our approach leads to a natural definition of directed conditional
independence of two elements in a stationary Gaussian process. We demonstrate
that the problem of learning sparse GGIMs for a given observation set can be
framed as a LASSO problem. By comparison with the problem of inverse covariance
estimation, we prove a bound on the difference between the covariance matrix
corresponding to a sparse GGIM and the covariance matrix corresponding to the
$l_1$-norm penalized maximum log-likelihood estimate. Finally, we consider the
problem of learning GGIMs associated with sparse directed conditional
dependence relationships. In all, the new model presents a novel perspective on
directed relationships between variables and significantly expands on the state
of the art in Gaussian graphical modeling.

number of core developers. The loss of such core developers might be
detrimental for projects and even threaten their entire continuation. However,
it is possible that new core developers assume the project maintenance and
allow the project to survive. Aims: The objective of this paper is to provide
empirical evidence on: 1) the frequency of project abandonment and survival, 2)
the differences between abandoned and surviving projects, and 3) the motivation
and difficulties faced when assuming an abandoned project. Method: We adopt a
mixed-methods approach to investigate project abandonment and survival. We
carefully select 1,932 popular GitHub projects and recover the abandoned and
surviving projects, and conduct a survey with developers that have been
instrumental in the survival of the projects. Results: We found that 315
projects (16%) were abandoned and 128 of these projects (41%) survived because
of new core developers who assumed the project development. The survey
indicates that (i) in most cases the new maintainers were aware of the project
abandonment risks when they started to contribute; (ii) their own usage of the
systems is the main motivation to contribute to such projects; (iii) human and
social factors played a key role when making these contributions; and (iv) lack
of time and the difficulty to obtain push access to the repositories are the
main barriers faced by them. Conclusions: Project abandonment is a reality even
in large open source projects and our work enables a better understanding of
such risks, as well as highlights ways in avoiding them.

Overlapping Basic Service Set (OBSS). However, many unknowns exist about the
performance gains that can be achieved through SR. In this paper, we provide a
brief introduction to the SR operation described in the IEEE 802.11ax (draft
D4.0). Then, a simulation-based implementation is provided in order to explore
the performance gains of the SR operation. Our results show the potential of
using SR in different scenarios covering multiple network densities and traffic
loads. In particular, we observe significant improvements on the channel
utilization when applying SR with respect to the default configuration, thus
allowing to increase the throughput and reduce the delay. Interestingly, the
highest improvements provided by the SR operation are observed in the most
pessimistic situations in terms of network density and traffic load.

orbits of inspiralling binary systems. But in recent papers, Loutrel et al.
have argued that at late times in such inspirals, one measure of eccentricity
actually increases, and that this could have observable consequences. We show
that this variable, the magnitude of the Runge-Lenz vector ($e_{\rm RL}$), is
not an appropriate measure of orbital eccentricity, when the eccentricity is
smaller than the leading non-Keplerian perturbation of the orbit. Following
Loutrel et al., we use Newtonian equations of motion plus the leading
gravitational radiation-reaction terms, the osculating-orbits approach for
characterizing binary orbits, and a two-timescale analysis for separating
secular from periodic variations of the orbit elements. We find that $e_{\rm
RL}$ does grow at late times, but that the actual orbital variables $r$ and
$dr/dt$ show no such growth in oscillations. This is in complete agreement with
Loutrel et al. We reconcile this apparent contradiction by pointing out that it
is essential to take into account the direction of the Runge-Lenz vector, not
just its magnitude. At late times in an inspiral, that direction, which defines
the pericenter angle, advances at the same rate as the orbital phase. The
correct picture is then of a physically circular orbit whose osculating
counterpart is indeed eccentric but that resides permanently at the orbit's
latus rectum at $-90^{\rm o}$, therefore exhibiting no oscillations. Including
first post-Newtonian effects in the equations of motion, we show that $e_{\rm
RL}$ grows even more dramatically. But the phase of the Runge-Lenz vector again
rotates with the orbit at late times, but now the osculating orbit resides at
""perpetual apocenter"", so again the physical orbit circularizes.

undesired decohering effects, which are present in realistic quantum dynamics.
To deal with this issue, a powerful strategy is to employ transitionless
quantum driving (TQD), where additional fields are added to speed up the
evolution of the quantum system, achieving a desired state in a short time in
comparison with the natural decoherence time scales. In this paper, we provide
an experimental investigation of the performance of a generalized approach for
TQD to implement shortcuts to adiabaticity in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).
As a first discussion, we consider a single nuclear spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system
in a time-dependent rotating magnetic field. While the adiabatic dynamics is
violated at a resonance situation, the TQD Hamiltonian is shown to be robust
against resonance, allowing us to mimic the adiabatic behavior in a fast
evolution even under the resonant configurations of the original (adiabatic)
Hamiltonian. Moreover, we show that the generalized TQD theory requires less
energy resources, with the strength of the magnetic field less than that
required by standard TQD. As a second discussion, we analyze the experimental
implementation of shortcuts to single-qubit adiabatic gates. By adopting
generalized TQD, we can provide feasible time-independent driving Hamiltonians,
which are optimized in terms of the number of pulses used to implement the
quantum dynamics. The robustness of adiabatic and generalized TQD evolutions
against typical decoherence processes in NMR is also analyzed.

study the distributions of their temperature, iron (Fe) abundance and

simultaneously, and in a comprehensive way, on the chemical and thermodynamic
properties of the freshly collided intracluster medium (ICM). The Fe
distribution of these clusters along the merging axis is found to be in good
agreement with the azimuthally-averaged Fe abundance profile in typical
non-cool-core clusters out to $r_{500}$. In addition to showing a moderate
central abundance peak, though less pronounced than in relaxed systems, the Fe
abundance flattens at large radii towards $\sim$0.2-0.3 $Z_\odot$. Although
this shallow metal distribution is in line with the idea that disturbed,
non-cool-core clusters originate from the merging of relaxed, cool-core
clusters, we find that in some cases, remnants of metal-rich and low entropy
cool cores can persist after major mergers. While we obtain a mild
anti-correlation between the Fe abundance and the pseudo-entropy in the (lower
entropy, $K$ = 200-500 keV cm$^2$) inner regions, no clear correlation is found
at (higher entropy, $K$ = 500-2300 keV cm$^2$) outer radii. The apparent
spatial abundance uniformity that we find at large radii is difficult to
explain through an efficient mixing of freshly injected metals, particularly in
systems for which the time since the merger is short. Instead, our results
provide important additional evidence in favour of the early enrichment
scenario - in which the bulk of the metals are released outside galaxies at $z$
> 2-3 - and extend it from cool-core and (moderate) non-cool-core clusters to a
few of the most disturbed merging clusters as well. These results constitute a
first step towards a deeper understanding of the chemical history of merging

Inclusion of viscous anharmonic damping in the model allows us, for the first

anharmonicity-smeared van Hove singularity. Upon increasing the coupling
strength between the host and the guest dynamics, and by decreasing the energy

lower frequencies. Moreover, we find a robust linear correlation between the BP

the future state of the system is fully determined by only its present state,
not by its previous history. There have been several measures of
non-Markovianity to quantify the degrees of non-Markovian effect in a process
of an open quantum system based on information backflow from the environment to
the system. However, the condition for the witness of the system information
backflow does not coincide with the classical definition of a Markovian
process. Recently, a new measure with a condition that coincides with the
classical definition in the relevant limit has been proposed. Here, we focus on
the new definition (measure) for quantum non-Markovian processes, and
characterize the Markovian condition as a quantum process that has no
information backflow through the reduced environment state (IBTRES) and no
system-environment correlation effect (SECE). The action of IBTRES produces
non-Markovian effects by flowing the information of quantum operations
performed by an experimenter at earlier times back to the system through the
environment, while the SECE can produce non-Markovian effect without carrying
any earlier quantum operation information. We give the necessary and sufficient
conditions for no IBTRES and no SECE, respectively, and show that a process is
Markovian if and only if it has no IBTRES and no SECE. The quantitative
measures and algorithms for calculating non-Markovianity, IBTRES and soly-SECE
are explicitly presented.

  Abstract syntax trees (ASTs) capture these structural properties and play an

past decade, learning based ego-motion estimation methods have seen an
increasing attention because of its desirable properties of robustness to image
noise and camera calibration independence. In this work, we propose a
data-driven approach of fully trainable visual ego-motion estimation for a
monocular camera. We use an end-to-end learning approach in allowing the model
to map directly from input image pairs to an estimate of ego-motion
(parameterized as 6-DoF transformation matrices). We introduce a novel
two-module Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks called
PoseConvGRU, with an explicit sequence pose estimation loss to achieve this.
The feature-encoding module encodes the short-term motion feature in an image
pair, while the memory-propagating module captures the long-term motion feature
in the consecutive image pairs. The visual memory is implemented with
convolutional gated recurrent units, which allows propagating information over
time. At each time step, two consecutive RGB images are stacked together to
form a 6 channels tensor for module-1 to learn how to extract motion
information and estimate poses. The sequence of output maps is then passed
through a stacked ConvGRU module to generate the relative transformation pose
of each image pair. We also augment the training data by randomly skipping
frames to simulate the velocity variation which results in a better performance
in turning and high-velocity situations. We evaluate the performance of our
proposed approach on the KITTI Visual Odometry benchmark. The experiments show
a competitive performance of the proposed method to the geometric method and
encourage further exploration of learning based methods for the purpose of
estimating camera ego-motion even though geometrical methods demonstrate
promising results.

pattern of resonances with one sharper resonance whose quantum numbers, mass

unconventional computing devices, we describe the development of liquid marbles
with neuromorphic properties through the use of copper coatings and 1.0 mg/ml
carbon nanotube-containing fluid cores. Experimentation was performed through
sandwiching the marbles between two cup-style electrodes and stimulating them
with repeated DC pulses at 3.0 V. Our results demonstrate that `entrainment' of
a carbon nanotube filled-copper liquid marble via periodic pulses can cause
their electrical resistance to rapidly switch between high to low resistance
profiles, upon inverting the polarity of stimulation: the reduction in
resistance between high and low profiles was approximately 88\% after two
rounds of entrainment. This effect was found to be reversible through reversion
to the original stimulus polarity and was strengthened by repeated
experimentation, as evidenced by a mean reduction in time to switching onset of
43\%. These effects were not replicated in nanotube solutions not bound inside
liquid marbles. Our electrical characterisation also reveals that
nanotube-filled liquid marbles exhibit pinched loop hysteresis IV profiles
consistent with the description of memristors. We conclude by discussing the
applications of this technology to the development of unconventional computing
devices and the study of emergent characteristics in biological neural tissue.

universal computing applications will require a dynamic control of the CMP on
demand and within nanoseconds. In this work, we perform fast manipulations of
the different CMP modes with independent but coherent pulses to the cavity and
magnon system. We change the state of the CMP from the energy exchanging beat
mode to its normal modes and further demonstrate two fundamental examples of
coherent manipulation: First, a dynamic control over the appearance of
magnon-Rabi oscillations, i.e., energy exchange, and second, a complete energy
extraction by applying an anti-phase drive to the magnon. Our results show a
promising approach to control different building blocks for a quantum internet
and pave the way for further magnon-based quantum computing research.

defined as the reward loss with respect to a player that always plays the most

context of communication networks and financial investment applications. We
develop a strategy that selects arms to be played in a consecutive manner,
dubbed Adaptive Sequencing Rules (ASR) algorithm. The sequencing rules for
selecting arms under the ASR algorithm are adaptively updated and controlled by
the current sample reward means. By designing judiciously the adaptive
sequencing rules, we show that the ASR algorithm achieves a logarithmic regret
order with time, and a finite-sample bound on the regret is established.
Although existing methods have shown a logarithmic regret order with time in
this RMAB setting, the theoretical analysis shows a significant improvement in
the regret scaling with respect to the system parameters under ASR. Extensive

freedom, which is work-conjugate to the stress gradient. This tensor was called
micro-displacements just for dimensional reasons. Consequently, this theory
requires a constitutive relation between stress gradient and
micro-displacements, in addition to the conventional stress-strain relation.
The formulation of such a constitutive relation and identification of the
parameters therein is difficult without an interpretation of the
micro-displacement tensor. The present contribution presents an homogenization
concept from a Cauchy continuum at the micro-scale towards a stress-gradient
continuum at the macro-scale. Conventional static boundary conditions at the
volume element are interpreted as a Taylor series whose next term involves the
stress gradient. A generalized Hill-Mandel lemma shows that the
micro-displacements can be identified with the deviatoric part of the first
moment of the microscopic strain field. Kinematic and periodic boundary
conditions are provided as alternative to the static ones. The homogenization
approach is used to compute the stress-gradient properties of an elastic porous
material. The predicted negative size effect under uni-axial loading is
compared with respective experimental results for foams and direct numerical
simulations from literature.

GCM for HAT-P-7b to evaluate our kinetic cloud formation model consistently
with the local equilibrium gas-phase composition. The day/night temperature
difference on HAT-P-7b (~ 2500K) causes clouds to form on the nightside
(dominated by H2/He) while the dayside (dominated by H/He) retains cloud-free
equatorial regions. The cloud particles vary in composition and size throughout
the vertical extension of the cloud, but also globally.
TiO2[s]/Al2O3[s]/CaTiO3[s]-particles of cm-sized radii occur in the higher
dayside-latitudes, resulting in a dayside dominated by gas-phase opacity. The
opacity on the nightside, however, is dominated by 0.01 ... 0.1 mum particles
made of a material mix dominated by silicates. The gas pressure at which the
atmosphere becomes optically thick is ~1d-4 bar in cloudy regions, and ~0.1 bar
in cloud-free regions. HAT-P-7b features strong morning/evening terminator
asymmetries, providing an example of patchy clouds and
azimuthally-inhomogeneous chemistry. The large temperature differences result
in an increasing geometrical extension from the night- to the dayside. The
chemcial equilibrium H2O abundance at the terminator changes by < 1 dex with
altitude and < 0.3 dex (a factor of 2) across the terminator for a given
pressure, indicating that H2O abundances derived from transmission spectra can
be representative of the well-mixed metallicity at P > 10 bar. We suggest the
atmospheric C/O as an important tool to trace the presence and location of
clouds in exoplanet atmospheres. Phase curve variability of HAT-P-7b is
unlikely to be caused by dayside clouds.

However, it has been recently argued that endowing configuration space with the
Jacobi metric is inappropriate to consistently describe the
stability/instability properties of Newtonian dynamics because of the
non-affine parametrization of the arc length with physical time. To the
contrary, in the present paper, it is shown that there is no such inconsistency
and that the observed instabilities in the case of integrable systems using the
Jacobi metric are artefacts.

dropping out small entries (truncation) of input matrices. Another approach,
the sparse approximate multiplication algorithm [M. Challacombe and N. Bock,
arXiv preprint 1011.3534, 2010] performs truncation of sub-matrix products. We
consider these two methods and their combination, i.e. truncation of both input

Tasks programming model and library [E. H. Rubensson and E. Rudberg, Parallel

absolute error in the Frobenius norm behaves as $O\left(n^{1/2} \right), n

0,\,\, \forall p < 2$ for all three methods, where $n$ is the matrix size and
$\tau$ is the truncation threshold. We compare the methods on a model problem

also applied to matrices coming from large chemical systems with $\sim 10^6$
atoms. We show that the combination of the two methods achieves better weak

undergoing deformation on passing an electrical pulse through it. The lowering
of flow stress during electrical pulsing has been attributed to a combination
of three mechanisms: softening due to Joule-heating of the material, de-pinning
of dislocations from paramagnetic obstacles, and the electron-wind force acting
on dislocations. However, there is no consensus in literature regarding the
relative magnitudes of the reductions in flow stress resulting from each of
these mechanisms. In this paper, we extend a dislocation density based crystal
plasticity model to incorporate the mechanisms of electroplasticity and perform
simulations where a single electrical pulse is applied during compressive
deformation of a polycrystalline FCC material with random texture. We analyze
the reductions in flow stress to understand the relative importance of the

for controllable synthesis of selected instrument sounds by sampling from the

using original labeled data. These classifiers achieve high accuracy when
tested on our synthesized sounds, which verifies the model performance of
controllable realistic timbre and pitch synthesis. Our model also enables

in living cells. It polymerizes a protein in a step-by-step manner as directed
by the corresponding nucleotide sequence on the template messenger RNA (mRNA)
and this process is referred to as `translation' of the genetic message encoded
in the sequence of mRNA transcript. In each successful chemo-mechanical cycle
during the (protein) elongation stage, the ribosome elongates the protein by a
single subunit, called amino acid, and steps forward on the template mRNA by
three nucleotides called a codon. Therefore, a ribosome is also regarded as a
molecular motor for which the mRNA serves as the track, its step size is that
of a codon and two molecules of GTP and one molecule of ATP hydrolyzed in that
cycle serve as its fuel. What adds further complexity is the existence of
competing pathways leading to distinct cycles, branched pathways in each cycle
and futile consumption of fuel that leads neither to elongation of the nascent
protein nor forward stepping of the ribosome on its track. We investigate a
model formulated in terms of the network of discrete chemo-mechanical states of
a ribosome during the elongation stage of translation. The model is analyzed
using a combination of stochastic thermodynamic and kinetic analysis based on a

the various possible modes of operation of a ribosome in terms of its average
velocity and mean rate of GTP hydrolysis. We also compute entropy production as

long-range Coulomb force and the short-range strong force, is believed to be
present in astrophysical scenarios, such as neutron stars and core-collapse
supernovae. Its structure can have a high impact e.g. on neutrino transport or
the tidal deformability of neutron stars.
  Purpose: We study several possible pasta configurations, all of them minimal
surface configurations, which are expected to appear in the mid-density regime
of nuclear pasta, i.e. around 40% of the nuclear saturation density. In
particular we are interested in the energy spectrum for different pasta
configurations considered.
  Method: Employing the density functional theory (DFT) approach, we calculate
the binding energy of the different configurations for three values of the
proton content XP = 1/10, 1/3 and 1/2, by optimizing their periodic length. We
study finite temperature effects and the impact of electron screening.
  Results: Nuclear pasta lowers the energy significantly compared to uniform
matter, especially for $X_P \geq 1/3$. However, the different configurations
have very similar binding energies. For large proton content, $X_P \geq 1/3$,
the pasta configurations are very stable, for lower proton content temperatures
of a few MeV are enough for the transition to uniform matter. Electron
screening has a small influence on the binding energy of nuclear pasta, but
increases its periodic length.
  Conclusion: Nuclear pasta in the mid-density regime lowers the energy of the
matter for all proton fractions under study. It can survive even large
temperatures of several MeV. Since various configurations have very similar
energy, it is to expected that many configurations can coexist simultaneously
already at small temperatures.

computationally efficient methods to account for skull aberrations. Here, we
derive a general method for the angular spectrum approach (ASA) in a
heterogeneous medium, based on a numerical marching scheme to approximate the
full implicit solution. We then demonstrate its functionality with simulations
for (human) skull-related aberration correction and trans-skull passive
acoustic mapping. Our simulations show that the general solution provides
accurate trans-skull focusing as compared to the uncorrected case for
clinically relevant frequencies, apertures, and targets, with the effects of
skull attenuation and amplitude shading included. In the case of source
localization, our method leads to an average of 75 % error reduction and 40 to
60 % increase in peak intensity, evaluated over the range of frequencies as
compared to the homogeneous medium ASA. Overall, total computation times for
both focusing and point source localization of the order milliseconds can be
attained with this approach. Collectively our findings indicate that the
proposed phase correction method based on the ASA could provide a
computationally efficient and accurate method for trans-skull transmit focusing
and imaging of point scatterers, potentially opening new possibilities for
treatment and diagnosis of brain diseases.

either rank the candidates or identify a small set of winners according to
voters' preferences. In practice, voters do not provide a full ranking;
instead, each voter provides their favorite K candidates, potentially in ranked
order. The election organizer must choose K and an aggregation rule.
  We provide a theoretical framework to make these choices. Each K-Approval or
K-partial ranking mechanism (with a corresponding positional scoring rule)
induces a learning rate for the speed at which the election correctly recovers
the asymptotic outcome. Given the voter choice distribution, the election
planner can thus identify the rate optimal mechanism. Earlier work in this area
provides coarse order-of-magnitude guaranties which are not sufficient to make
such choices. Our framework further resolves questions of when randomizing
between multiple mechanisms may improve learning, for arbitrary voter noise
models.
  Finally, we use data from 5 large participatory budgeting elections that we
organized across several US cities, along with other ranking data, to
demonstrate the utility of our methods. In particular, we find that

of such a transition - known as spontaneous scalarization - associated with the
spontaneous symmetry breaking of a scalar field near a compact object. Using a
strong-field-agnostic effective-field-theory approach, we show that all
theories that exhibit spontaneous scalarization can also manifest dynamical
scalarization, a phase transition associated with symmetry breaking in a binary
system. We derive an effective point-particle action that provides a simple
parametrization describing both phenomena, which establishes a foundation for

results are obtained for the wave functions of single-electron energy
eigenstates and the matrix elements for optical transitions between them. As
expected from spherical symmetry, quantized levels in TI nanoparticles can be
labeled by quantum numbers $j$ and $m=-j, -j+1, \dots, j$ for total angular
momentum and its projection on an arbitrary axis. The fact that TIs are
narrow-gap materials, where the charge-carrier dynamics is described by a type
of two-flavor Dirac model, requires $j$ to assume half-integer values and also
causes a doubling of energy-level degeneracy where two different classes of
states are distinguished by being parity eigenstates with eigenvalues
$(-1)^{j\mp 1/2}$. The existence of energy eigenstates having the same $j$ but
opposite parity enables optical transitions where $j$ is conserved, in addition
to those adhering to the familiar selection rule where $j$ changes by $\pm 1$.
All optical transitions satisfy the usual selection rule $\Delta m = 0, \pm 1$.
We treat intra- and inter-band optical transitions on the same footing and
establish ways for observing unusual quantum-size effects in TI nanoparticles,
including oscillatory dependences of the band gap and of transition amplitudes

multi-band models for charge carriers in semiconductors and Dirac fermions from

  Perturbation Theory","35 pages",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The search for quantum gravity fingerprints in currently available
cosmological data that have their origin from the Planck era is of growing
interest due to major recent progress both in the theoretical modelling as well
as the observational precision. Unsurprisingly, the theoretical predictions are
very sensitive to the quantum effects that occur close to the classical big
bang singularity. It is therefore of substantial interest to describe these
effects as precisely as possible. This is the first in a series of papers that
aim at improving on the treatment of quantum effects that arise due to
backreactions between matter and geometry. The technique we employ is space
adiabatic perturbation theory (SAPT) in the form developed in seminal papers by
Panati, Spohn and Teufel. SAPT is a generalisation of the more familiar Born
Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA) that applies well in systems that allow a split
of the degrees of freedom into two sets that propagate on rather different time
scales such as the homogeneous and inhomogeneous field modes in cosmology. We
will show that this leads to presently neglected correction terms in the
quantum Friedman equations.
  In the present paper we adapt and generalise SAPT to the hybrid approach to
quantum cosmology developed by Mena Marugan et al. that allows for a systematic
quantum separation of the (in)homogeneous modes. Since SAPT was developed for
quantum mechanics rather than quantum field theory, several challenges have to
be met.

SDSS, WISE, and Pan-STARRS images to likely represent distant clusters at
redshifts $z \gtrsim 0.7$. We obtain photometric redshift and richness
estimates for all of the cluster candidates from a red-sequence analysis of
$r$-, $i$-, and $z$-band imaging data. In addition, long-slit observations
allow us to measure the redshifts of a subset of the clusters
spectroscopically. The optical richness is often lower than expected from the
inferred SZ mass when compared to scaling relations previously calibrated at
low redshifts. This likely indicates the impact of Eddington bias and
projection effects or noise-induced detections, especially at low
SZ-significance. Thus, optical follow-up not only provides redshift
measurements, but also an important independent verification method. We find
that 18 (7) of the candidates at redshifts $z > 0.5$ ($z > 0.8$) are at least
half as rich as expected from scaling relations, thereby clearly confirming
these candidates as massive clusters. While the complex selection function of
our sample due to our preselection hampers its use for cosmological studies, we
do provide a validation of massive high-redshift clusters particularly suitable

strategies, and we consider succinct representation of such strategies. The
decision-tree data structure from machine learning retains the flavor of
decisions of strategies and allows entropy-based minimization to obtain
succinct trees. However, in contrast to traditional machine-learning problems
where small errors are allowed, for winning strategies in graph games and MDPs
no error is allowed, and the decision tree must represent the entire strategy.
In this work we propose decision trees with linear classifiers for
representation of strategies in graph games and MDPs. We have implemented
strategy representation using this data structure and we present experimental
results for problems on graph games and MDPs, which show that this new data

Mapper construction. Persistence employs a sequence of objects built on data
called a filtration. A Mapper produces insightful summaries of data, and has
found widespread applications in diverse areas.
  We define a new filtration called the cover filtration built from a single
cover based on a generalized Steinhaus distance, which is a generalization of
Jaccard distance. We prove a stability result: the cover filtrations of two
covers are $\alpha/m$ interleaved, where $\alpha$ is a bound on bottleneck
distance between covers and $m$ is the size of smallest set in either cover. We
also show our construction is equivalent to the Cech filtration under certain
settings, and the Vietoris-Rips filtration completely determines the cover
filtration in all cases. We then develop a theory for stable paths within this
filtration. Unlike standard results on stability in topological persistence,
our definition of path stability aligns exactly with the above result on
stability of cover filtration.
  We demonstrate how our framework can be employed in a variety of applications
where a metric is not obvious but a cover is readily available. First we
present a new model for recommendation systems using cover filtration. For an
explicit example, stable paths identified on a movies data set represent
sequences of movies constituting gentle transitions from one genre to another.
As a second application in explainable machine learning, we apply the Mapper
for model induction, providing explanations in the form of paths between
subpopulations. Stable paths in the Mapper from a supervised machine learning

algorithm does not require the solution of an optimization problem during
run-time, it can be deployed even on resource-constrained systems. We

equivariant against transformations in a more general fashion by capturing
complex patterns of visual structures beyond the conventional linear
equivariance under a transformation group. The presented approach can be

synchronization stability that quantifies how well the power-grid system
recovers its synchrony against perturbation depends on various factors. As an
intrinsic factor that we can design and control, the transmission capacity of
the power grid affects the synchronization stability. Therefore, the transition
pattern of the synchronization stability with the different levels of
transmission capacity against external perturbation provides the stereoscopic
perspective to understand the synchronization behavior of power grids. In this
study, we extensively investigate the factors affecting the synchronization
stability transition by using the concept of basin stability as a function of
the transmission capacity. For a systematic approach, we introduce the
integrated basin instability, which literally adds up the instability values as
the transmission capacity increases. We first take simple 5-node motifs as a
case study of building blocks of power grids, and a more realistic IEEE 24-bus
model to highlight the complexity of decisive factors. We find that both
structural properties such as gate keepers in network topology and dynamical
properties such as large power input/output at nodes cause synchronization
instability. The results suggest that evenly distributed power generation and
avoidance of bottlenecks can improve the overall synchronization stability of
power-grid systems.

set of differential equations and prove that this description is asymptotically
exact in the limit of large inputs. Using this framework, we calculate the
final generalisation error of student networks that have more parameters than
their teachers. We find that the final generalisation error of the student
increases with network size when training only the first layer, but stays
constant or even decreases with size when training both layers. We show that
these different behaviours have their root in the different solutions SGD finds
for different activation functions. Our results indicate that achieving good
generalisation in neural networks goes beyond the properties of SGD alone and
depends on the interplay of at least the algorithm, the model architecture, and
the data set.

includes $N^2_F$ additional colorless but flavored fields $\Phi_{i}^{j}$, with

weakly coupled, in all different vacua with the unbroken or spontaneously
broken flavor symmetry $U(N_F)\rightarrow U(n_1)\times U(n_2)$.
  Further, the mass spectra of this direct $\Phi$-theory and its Seiberg's dual
variant, the $d\Phi$-theory, are calculated at $3N_c/2<N_F<2N_c$ and various
values of $\mu_{\Phi}/\Lambda_Q\gg 1$ (in strong coupling regimes), using the
dynamical scenario introduced by the author in his previous article \cite{ch3}.
This scenario assumes that quarks can be in two different standard phases only:
either this is the HQ (heavy quark) phase where they are confined, or they are
higgsed. Within the used dynamical scenario, it is shown that mass spectra of
the direct $\Phi$ and dual $d\Phi$ - theories are parametrically different.
  Besides it is shown in the direct $\Phi$-theory that a qualitatively new
phenomenon takes place: under appropriate conditions, the seemingly heavy and
dynamically irrelevant fields $\Phi$ 'return back' and there appear two
additional generations of light $\Phi$-particles with small masses $\mu^{\rm
pole}(\Phi)\ll\Lambda_Q$.

${\cal N}=1$ by the large mass parameter of the adjoint scalar superfield $X,

theories are described, in particular, the conditions under which they are

light absorption and scattering in the water medium. A hazed image formation
model is widely used to restore the image quality. It depends on two optical
parameters: the background light and the transmission map. Underwater images
can also be enhanced by color and contrast correction from the perspective of
image processing. In this paper, we propose an effective underwater image
enhancement method for underwater images in composition of underwater image
restoration and color correction. Firstly, a manually annotated background
lights (MABLs) database is developed. With reference to the relationship
between MABLs and the histogram distributions of various underwater images,
robust statistical models of BLs estimation are provided. Next, the TM of R
channel is roughly estimated based on the new underwater dark channel prior via
the statistic of clear and high resolution underwater images, then a scene
depth map based on the underwater light attenuation prior and an adjusted
reversed saturation map are applied to compensate and modify the coarse TM of R
channel. Next, TMs of G-B channels are estimated based on the difference of
attenuation ratios between R channel and G-B channels. Finally, to improve the
color and contrast of the restored image with a natural appearance, a variation
of white balance is introduced as post-processing. In order to guide the
priority of underwater image enhancement, sufficient evaluations are conducted
to discuss the impacts of the key parameters including BL and TM, and the
importance of the color correction. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art
methods demonstrate that our proposed underwater image enhancement method can
achieve higher accuracy of estimated BLs, less computation time, more superior
performance, and more valuable information retention.

also observe a trade-off between an eco-dictatorship (reduced model with a
single governance actor that always taxes unsustainable resource use) and the
polycentric governance network of multiple actors. In the latter setup,
sustainability is enhanced for low but hindered for high tax rates compared to
the eco-dictatorship case. These results highlight mechanisms generating
emergent critical transitions in contagion dynamics on multilayer adaptive
network and show how these can be understood and approximated analytically,

system, characterized by different volume fractions or confining pressures. We
use experiments on granular systems and numerical simulations of emulsions to
show that systems having the same probability distribution for avalanche size
and duration can have different interevent time distributions. Remarkably, for
large packing ratios, these interevent time distributions look similar to those
for earthquakes and are indirect evidence of large space-time correlations in
the system. Our results therefore indicate that interevent time statistics are
more informative to characterize the dynamics of avalanches.

decompose the composite into these factors. We compare the performance of
Resonator Networks against optimization-based methods, including Alternating
Least Squares and several gradient-based algorithms, showing that Resonator
Networks are superior in several important ways. This advantage is achieved by
leveraging a combination of nonlinear dynamics and ""searching in

weighted superposition of all possible solutions. While the alternative methods
also search in superposition, the dynamics of Resonator Networks allow them to
strike a more effective balance between exploring the solution space and
exploiting local information to drive the network toward probable solutions.
Resonator Networks are not guaranteed to converge, but within a particular
regime they almost always do. In exchange for relaxing this guarantee of global
convergence, Resonator Networks are dramatically more effective at finding
factorizations than all alternative approaches considered.

topological properties of Kitaev chains and ladders under the perturbing effect
of a current flux injected into the system using an external normal lead and
derived from it via a superconducting electrode. After discussing the
topological phase diagram of the isolated systems, using a scattering technique
within the Bogoliubov de Gennes formulation, we analyze the differential
conductance properties of these topological devices as a function of all
relevant model parameters. The relevant problem of implementing local
spectroscopic measurements to characterize topological systems is also
addressed by studying the system electrical response as a function of the
position and the distance of the normal electrode (tip). The results show how
the signatures of topological order affect the electrical response of the
analyzed systems, a subset of which being robust also against the effects of a
moderate amount of disorder. The analysis of the internal modes of the
nanodevices demonstrates that topological protection can be lost when quantum
states of an initially isolated topological system are hybridized with those of
the external reservoirs. The conclusions of this work could be useful in
understanding the topological phases of nanowire-based mesoscopic devices.

liquidtronic magnetoresistance is that it naturally operates at higher

patient characteristics to derive likelihood of diseases or predict clinical
outcomes. When selecting a predictive tool, for implementation at clinical
practice or for recommendation in clinical guidelines, clinicians are
challenged with an overwhelming and ever growing number of tools, most of which
have never been implemented or assessed for comparative effectiveness.
Objective: To develop a comprehensive framework to Grade and Assess Predictive
tools (GRASP), and provide clinicians with a standardised, evidence based
system to support their search for and selection of effective tools. Methods: A
focused review of literature was conducted to extract criteria along which
tools should be evaluated. An initial framework was designed and applied to
assess and grade five tools: LACE Index, Centor Score, Wells Criteria, Modified
Early Warning Score, and Ottawa knee rule. After peer review, by expert
clinicians and healthcare researchers, the framework was revised and the
grading of the tools was updated. Results: GRASP framework grades predictive
tools based on published evidence across three dimensions: 1) Phase of
evaluation; 2) Level of evidence; and 3) Direction of evidence. The final grade
of a tool is based on the highest phase of evaluation, supported by the highest
level of positive evidence, or mixed evidence that supports positive
conclusion. Discussion and Conclusion: the GRASP framework builds on well
established models and widely accepted concepts to provide standardised
assessment and evidence based grading of predictive tools. Unlike other
methods, GRASP is based on the critical appraisal of published evidence
reporting the predictive tools predictive performance before implementation,
potential effect and usability during implementation, and their post
implementation impact.

cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Although security of a PoW cryptocurrency is
always the top priority, it is threatened by mining attacks like selfish
mining. Researchers have proposed many mining attack models with one attacker,
and optimized the attacker's strategy. During these mining attacks, an attacker
pursues a higher relative revenue (RR) by wasting a large amount of
computational power of the honest miners at the cost of a small amount of
computational power of himself. In this paper, we propose a mining attack model
with two phases: the original system and the multi-attacker system. It is the
first model to provide both theoretical and quantitative analysis of mining
attacks with two attackers. We explain how the original system turns into the
multi-attacker system by introducing two attackers: the internal attacker and
the external attacker. If both attackers take the attacking strategy selfish
mining, the RR of the internal attacker in multi-attacker system will drop by
up to 31.9% compared with his RR in original system. The external attacker will
overestimate his RR by up to 44.6% in multiattacker system. Unexpected
competitions, auctions between attackers and overestimation of attackers'
influence factor are three main causes of both attackers' dropping RR. We
propose a mining strategy named Partial Initiative Release (PIR) which is a
semi-honest mining strategy in multi-attacker system. In some specific
situations, PIR allows the attacker to get more block reward by launching an
attack in multi-attacker system.
