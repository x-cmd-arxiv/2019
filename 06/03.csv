limited training environments are susceptible to a large amount of overfitting
across many domains. A key challenge for RL generalization is to quantitatively
explain the effects of changing parameters on testing performance. Such
parameters include architecture, regularization, and RL-dependent variables
such as discount factor and action stochasticity. We provide empirical results
that show complex and interdependent relationships between hyperparameters and
generalization. We further show that several empirical metrics such as gradient
cosine similarity and trajectory-dependent metrics serve to provide intuition
towards these results.

order to obtain the correct strong-field behavior of the effective potential

anisotropy $\langle {\hat \Sigma}_{xy} \rangle = 0$ for MS packings generated

stress state of MS packings, we develop packing-generation protocols to first
unjam the MS packings, remove the frictional contacts, and then rejam them.
Using these protocols, we are able to obtain rejammed packings with nearly
identical particle positions and stress anisotropy distributions compared to
the original jammed packings. However, we find that when we directly compare
the original jammed packings and rejammed ones, there are finite stress
anisotropy deviations $\Delta {\hat \Sigma}_{xy}$. The deviations are smaller
than the stress anisotropy fluctuations obtained by enumerating the force
solutions within the null space of the contact networks generated via the DEM

be residual differences in the normal and tangential forces at each contact,

aspects of the structure of archimedean vector lattices; we investigate two
such aspects in this article. We refer to archimedean vector lattices equipped
with a truncation as \emph{truncs}. In the first part of the article we review
the basic definitions, state the (pointed) Yosida Representation Theorem for
truncs, and then prove a representation theorem which subsumes and extends the
(pointfree) Madden Representation Theorem. The proof has the virtue of being
much shorter than the one in the literature, but the real novelty of the
theorem lies in the fact that the topological data dual to a given trunc $G$ is
a (localic) compactification, i.e., a dense pointed frame surjection $q \colon
M \to L$ out of a compact regular pointed frame $M$. The representation is an
amalgam of the Yosida and Madden representations; the compact frame $M$ is
sufficient to describe the behavior of the bounded part $G^*$ of $G$ in the
sense that $\widetilde{G}^*$ separates the points of the compact Hausdorff
pointed space $X$ dual to $M$, while the frame $L$ is just sufficient to
capture the behavior of the unbounded part of $G$ in $\mathcal{R}_0 L$. The
truncation operation lends itself to identifying those elements of a trunc
which behave like characteristic functions, and in the second part of the
article we characterize in several ways those truncs composed of linear
combinations of such elements. Along the way, we show that the category of such
truncs is equivalent to the category of pointed Boolean spaces, and to the
category of generalized Boolean algebras. The short third part contains a
characterization of the kernels of truncation homomorphisms in terms of
pointwise closure. In it we correct an error in the literature.

vortex analogy for the electromagnetic field and William Thomson's (Lord
Kelvin) theory that atoms were vortex rings in an all-pervading ether. By the
time of Maxwell's death in 1879, the basic laws of vortices in a perfect fluid
in three-dimensional Euclidean space had been established, as had their
importance to physics. Early vortex studies were embedded in a web of issues
spanning the fields we now know as ""mathematics"" and ""physics"" - fields which
had not yet become institutionally distinct disciplines but overlapped. This
paper investigates the conceptual issues with ideas of force, matter, and
space, that underlay mechanics and led to vortex models being an attractive
proposition for British physicists, and how these issues played out in the
mathematics of vortices, paying particular attention to problems around
continuity. It concludes that while they made valuable contributions to
hydrodynamics and the nascent field of topology, the British ultimately failed
in their more physical objectives.

allows for the infusion of prior information. To evaluate the utility of the

dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising for optical modulation, detection, and
light emission since their material properties can be tuned on-demand via
electrostatic doping. The optical properties of TMDs have been shown to change
drastically with doping in the wavelength range near the excitonic resonances.
However, little is known about the effect of doping on the optical properties
of TMDs away from these resonances, where the material is transparent and
therefore could be leveraged in photonic circuits. Here, we probe the
electro-optic response of monolayer TMDs at near infrared (NIR) wavelengths
(i.e. deep in the transparency regime), by integrating them on silicon nitride
(SiN) photonic structures to induce strong light$-$matter interaction with the
monolayer. We dope the monolayer to carrier densities of ($7.2 \pm 0.8$)
$\times$ $10^{13} \textrm{cm}^{-2}$, by electrically gating the TMD using an
ionic liquid. We show strong electro-refractive response in monolayer tungsten
disulphide (WS$_2$) at NIR wavelengths by measuring a large change in the real
part of refractive index $\Delta$n = $0.53$, with only a minimal change in the
imaginary part $\Delta$k = $0.004$. The doping induced phase change
($\Delta$n), compared to the induced absorption ($\Delta$k) measured for WS$_2$
($\Delta$n/$\Delta$k $\sim 125$), a key metric for photonics, is an order of
magnitude higher than the $\Delta$n/$\Delta$k for bulk materials like silicon
($\Delta$n/$\Delta$k $\sim 10$), making it ideal for various photonic
applications. We further utilize this strong tunable effect to demonstrate an
electrostatically gated SiN-WS$_2$ phase modulator using a WS$_2$-HfO$_2$

modulation efficiency (V$_\pi$L) of 0.8 V $\cdot$ cm with a RC limited

Jupiters around A stars from the HATNet survey which have also been observed by
the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). HAT-P-69b has a mass of 3.58

as an opportunity to explore the occurrence rate of hot Jupiters as a function
of stellar mass. We define a sample of 47,126 main-sequence stars brighter than

3 candidates, and 10 false positives. We find a net hot Jupiter occurrence rate

Kepler for FGK stars. When divided into stellar mass bins, we find the
occurrence rate to be 0.71+/-0.31% for G stars, 0.43+/-0.15% for F stars, and
0.26+/-0.11% for A stars. Thus, at this point, we cannot discern any

recently, Gutzwiller-projected wave functions, typically constructed from

with neural networks, specifically with the so-called restricted Boltzmann

the ground state of generic spin models. In particular, we apply our neural
augmented fermionic construction to the description of both magnetically
ordered and disordered phases of increasing complexity, including cases where
the ground state displays a non-trivial sign structure. Even though the RBM
state is by far more effective for N\'eel states endowed with a particularly
simple sign structure, it provides a significant improvement over the original
fermionic state in highly frustrated regimes where a complex sign structure is
anticipated, thus marking the path to an understanding of strongly-correlated

interactions among numbers, it is still questionable whether such a proof can
be written down in full without computers' help. In this paper, we present a
computer-free proof that a sum-dominant set must have at least $7$ elements. We
also answer the question raised by the author of the current paper et al about
the smallest sum-dominant set of primes, in terms of its largest element. Using
computers, we find that the smallest sum-dominant set of primes has $73$ as its
maximum, smaller than the value found before.

models, scanning different universality classes, including transverse field
Ising, Potts and XXZ chains. We show that the R\'enyi entropies obtained via
the BW ansatz properly describe the scaling properties predicted by conformal

corrections to the conformal field theory scaling associated to the energy

discretized BW density matrix and the exact one asymptotically goes to zero

predict properties of the eigenvectors of the reduced density matrices, and is
thus potentially applicable to other entanglement-related quantities such as

during vapor-liquid transitions in a single component Lennard-Jones system.
Results from two different overall densities are presented; one in the
neighborhood of the vapor branch of the coexistence curve and the other being
close to the critical density. The nonequilibrium morphologies, growth
mechanisms and growth laws in the two cases are vastly different. In the low
density case growth occurs via diffusive coalescence of droplets in a
disconnected morphology. On the other hand, the elongated structure in the
higher density case grows via advective transport of particles inside the
tube-like liquid domains. The objective in this work has been to identify how
the decay of the order-parameter autocorrelation, an important quantity to
understand aging dynamics, differs in the two cases. In the case of the
disconnected morphology, we observe a very robust power-law decay, as a
function of the ratio of the characteristic lengths at the observation time and
at the age of the system, whereas the results for the percolating structure
appear rather complex. To quantify the decay in the latter case, unlike
standard method followed in a previous study, here we have performed a
finite-size scaling analysis. Outcome of this analysis shows the presence of a
strong preasymptotic correction, while revealing that in this case also, albeit
in the asymptotic limit, the decay follows a power-law. Even though the
corresponding exponents in the two cases differ drastically, this study,
combined with a few recent ones, suggests that power-law behavior of this
correlation function is rather universal in coarsening dynamics.

the gravitational wave energy density for deflagrations in strong transitions
is suppressed compared to that predicted in earlier work. This is largely

even if either (I) there is a only a single (private) independent random bit in
each polylog $n$-neighborhood of the graph, (II) the (private) bits of
randomness of different nodes are only polylog $n$-wise independent, or (III)
there are only polylog $n$ bits of global shared randomness (and no private
randomness). - Second, we study how much we can improve the error probability
of randomized algorithms. For all locally checkable problems for which polylog
$n$-time randomized algorithms exist, we show that there are such algorithms
that succeed with probability $1-n^{-2^{\varepsilon(\log\log n)^2}}$ and more
generally $T$-round algorithms, for $T\geq$ polylog $n$, that succeed with

randomized algorithms with success probability $1-2^{-2^{\log^\varepsilon n}}$

randomness and improving the success probability, can be seen as partial
derandomization of existing randomized algorithms. In all the above cases, we
also show that any significant improvement of our results would lead to a major

autonomous driving. Trajectory forecasting in the urban area is particularly
hard due to complex interactions with cars and pedestrians, and traffic lights
(TLs). Unlike the former that has been widely studied, the impact of TLs on the
trajectory prediction has been rarely discussed. In this work, we first
identify the less studied, perhaps overlooked impact of TLs. Second, we present
a novel resolution that is mindful of the impact, inspired by the fact that
human drives differently depending on signal phase (green, yellow, red) and
timing (elapsed time). Central to the proposed approach is Human Policy Models
which model how drivers react to various states of TLs by mapping a sequence of
states of vehicles and TLs to a subsequent action (acceleration) of the
vehicle. We then combine the Human Policy Models with a known transition
function (system dynamics) to conduct a sequential prediction; thus our
approach is viewed as Behavior Cloning. One novelty of our approach is the use
of vehicle-to-infrastructure communications to obtain the future states of TLs.
We demonstrate the impact of TL and the proposed approach using an ablation
study for longitudinal trajectory forecasting tasks on real-world driving data
recorded near a signalized intersection. Finally, we propose probabilistic
(generative) Human Policy Models which provide probabilistic contexts and
capture competing policies, e.g., pass or stop in the yellow-light dilemma
zone.

color string between the outgoing $q\bar{q}$ pair from $Z$ boson decays. The
associated yield distributions in both analyses are in better agreement with
the prediction from the PYTHIA v6.1 event generator than from HERWIG v7.1.5.

processing algorithms and quantum communications protocols. Although entangled
quantum states are often described in radix-2, higher-radix qudits can become
entangled as well. In this work, we both introduce partial entanglement, a
concept that does not exist for radix-2 quantum systems, and differentiate
between partial and maximal entanglement within non-binary quantum information
processing systems. We also develop and present higher-radix maximal
entanglement generator circuits that are analogous to the well-known Bell state
generator for binary quantum systems. Because higher-dimensioned qudits can be
subjected to entangling processes that result in either partially or maximally
entangled states, we demonstrate how higher-radix qudit circuits can be
composed to generate these varying degrees of partial quantum entanglement.
Theoretical results are provided for the general case where the radix is
greater than two, and specific results based on a pair of radix-4 qudits are
described.

extrusion has a strong potential to fasten the process through simultaneous
operation of the filament production and the deposition. This paper develops a
control algorithm for screw extrusion-based 3D printing of thermoplastic
materials through an observer-based output feedback design. We consider the
thermodynamic model describing the time evolution of the temperature profile of
an extruded polymer by means of a partial differential equation (PDE) defined
on the time-varying domain. The time evolution of the spatial domain is
governed by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that reflects the dynamics
of the position of the phase change interface between polymer granules and
molten polymer deposited as a molten filament. Steady-state profile of the
distributed temperature along the extruder is obtained when the desired
setpoint for the interface position is prescribed. To enhance the feasibility
of our previous design, we develop a PDE observer to estimate the temperature
profile via measured values of surface temperature and the interface position.
An output feedback control law considering a cooling mechanism at the boundary
inlet as an actuator is proposed. In extruders the control of raw material
temperature is commonly achieved using preconditioners as part of the inlet
feeding mechanism. For some given screw speeds that correspond to slow and fast
operating modes, numerical simulations are conducted to prove the performance
of the proposed controller. The convergence of the interface position to the
desired setpoint is achieved under physically reasonable temperature profiles.

interstellar medium (ISM) results in the strongest persistent gamma-ray line
signal in the sky. For 50 years, this 511 keV emission has puzzled observers
and theoreticians. A key issue for understanding $e^+$-astrophysics is found in
cosmic-ray propagation, especially at low kinetic energies (< 10 MeV). We want
to shed light on how $e^+$s propagate and the resulting morphology of the
emission. We approach this ""positron puzzle"" by inferring kinematic information
of the 511 keV line in the inner radian of the Galaxy. This constrains
propagation scenarios and source populations. By dissecting the 511 keV
emission as measured with INTEGRAL/SPI, we derive spectra for individual
regions in the sky. The centroid energies are converted into Doppler-shifts,
representing the line-of-sight velocity along different longitudes. This
results in a longitude-velocity diagram of $e^+$-annihilation. We also
determine Doppler-broadenings to study annihilation conditions as they vary
across the Galaxy. We find line-of-sight velocities in the 511 keV line that
are consistent with zero, as well as with galactic rotation from CO
measurements, and measurements of radioactive Al-26. The velocity gradient in
the inner 60 deg is determined to be $4\pm6$ km/s/deg. The 511 keV line width
is constant as a function of longitude at $2.43\pm0.14$ keV. The positronium
fraction is found to be 1.0 along the galactic plane. The weak signals in the
disk leave open the question whether $e^+$-annihilation is associated with the
high velocities seen in Al-26 or rather with ordinarily rotating components of
the Galaxy's ISM. We confirm previous results that $e^+$s are slowed down to
the 10 eV energy scale before annihilation, and constrain bulk
Doppler-broadening contributions to <1.25 keV. Consequently, the true
annihilation conditions remain unclear.

forward-shock model when the outflow was viewed off-axis, decelerated in a
uniform medium and parametrized through a power-law velocity distribution.
Motivated by the upper limits on the very-high-energy emission, and the
stratified medium in the close vicinity of a binary neutron star merger
proposed to explain the gamma-ray flux in the short GRB 150101B, we extend the

the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) and synchrotron forward-shock model when the

Controlling the probability that one or more intervals for selected parameters
do not cover---the ``simultaneous over the selected'' (SoS) error rate---is
crucial in many scientific problems. Intervals that control the SoS error rate
can be constructed in ways that take advantage of knowledge of the selection
rule. We construct SoS-controlling confidence intervals for parameters deemed
the most ``important'' $k$ of $m$ shift parameters because they are estimated
(by independent estimators) to be the largest. The new intervals improve
substantially over \v{S}id\'{a}k intervals when $k$ is small compared to $m$,
and approach the standard Bonferroni-corrected intervals when $k \approx m$.
Standard, unadjusted confidence intervals for location parameters have the
correct coverage probability for $k=1$, $m=2$ if, when the true parameters are

with significant practical applications such as numerical weather prediction.
Particle filters allow asymptotically consistent inference but require
infeasibly large ensemble sizes for accurate estimates in complex spatial
models. Localisation approaches, which perform local state updates by
exploiting low dependence between variables at distant points, have been
suggested as a potential resolution to this issue. Naively applying the
resampling step of the particle filter locally however produces implausible
spatially discontinuous states. The ensemble transform particle filter replaces
resampling with an optimal-transport map and can be localised by computing maps
for every spatial mesh node. The resulting local ensemble transport particle
filter is however computationally intensive for dense meshes. We propose a new
optimal-transport based local particle filter which computes a fixed number of
maps independent of the mesh resolution and interpolates these maps across
space, reducing the computation required and allowing it to be ensured
particles remain spatially smooth. We numerically illustrate that, at a reduced
computational cost, we are able to achieve the same accuracy as the local
ensemble transport particle filter, and retain its improved robustness to
non-Gaussianity and ability to quantify uncertainty when compared to local
ensemble Kalman filters.

demonstrated that the magnetization originated from Fe$^{2+}$ cations, whereas
Fe$^{3+}$ and Ti$^{4+}$ did not contribute. Films with the highest magnetic
moment (0.8 {\mu}B per Fe) had the highest measured Fe$^{2+}$:Fe${^3+}$ ratio
of 0.1 corresponding to the largest concentration of oxygen vacancies ({\delta}
= 0.19). Post-growth annealing treatments under oxidizing and reducing
conditions demonstrated quenching and partial recovery of magnetism
respectively, and a change in Fe valence states. The study elucidates the
microscopic origin of magnetism in highly Fe-substituted
SrTi$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$O$_{3-{\delta}}$ perovskite oxides and demonstrates that the
magnetic moment, which correlates with the relative content of Fe$^{2+}$ and
Fe$^{3+}$, can be controlled via the oxygen content, either during growth or by
post-growth annealing.

daily activities and help clinicians deliver more objective, personalized
treatments. While recent work has convincingly demonstrated that seizure risk
assessment is possible, these early approaches relied largely on complex, often
invasive setups including intracranial electrocorticography, implanted devices
and multi-channel EEG, which limits translation of these methods to broad
clinical application. To facilitate broader adaptation of seizure forecasting
in clinical practice, non-invasive, easily applicable techniques that reliably
assess seizure risk, in combination with clinical information, are crucial.
Wristbands that continuously record physiological parameters, including
electrodermal activity, body temperature, blood volume pressure and actigraphy,
may afford monitoring of autonomous nervous system function and movement
relevant for such a task, hence minimizing potential complications associated
with invasive monitoring, and avoiding stigma associated with bulky external
monitoring devices on the head. Here, we use deep learning to analyze
long-term, multi-modal wristband sensor data from 50 patients with epilepsy
(total duration $>$1400 hours) to assess its capability to distinguish preictal
from interictal states. Prediction performance is assessed using area under the
receiver operating charateristic (AUC) and improvement over chance (IoC) based
on F1 scores. Using one- and two-dimensional convolutional neural networks, we
identified better-than-chance predictability in out-of-sample test data in 60\%
of the patients in leave-one-out and 43\% of patients in pseudo-prospective

into several application domains. A common need in using machine learning
models is collecting the data required to train these models. In some cases,
labeling a massive dataset can be a crippling bottleneck, so there is need to
develop models that work when training labels for large amounts of data are not
easily obtained. A possible solution is weak supervision, which uses noisy
labels that are easily obtained from multiple sources. The challenge is how
best to combine these noisy labels and train a model to perform well given a
task. In this paper, we propose stochastic generalized adversarial label
learning (Stoch-GALL), a framework for training machine learning models that
perform well when noisy and possibly correlated labels are provided. Our
framework allows users to provide different weak labels and multiple
constraints on these labels. Our model then attempts to learn parameters for
the data by solving a non-zero sum game optimization. The game is between an
adversary that chooses labels for the data and a model that minimizes the error
made by the adversarial labels. We test our method on three datasets by
training convolutional neural network models that learn to classify image
objects with limited access to training labels. Our approach is able to learn
even in settings where the weak supervision confounds state-of-the-art weakly

complicated one (in the Heisenberg picture), which characterizes quantum chaos
in many-body systems. More specifically, a simple operator evolves into a
linear superposition of many operators, most of which are many-body operators
supported on a region of size much larger than $1$. In general, an operator
does not have a definite size but is characterized by a probability
distribution of size. The operator size is related to out-of-time-order
correlation functions, but these are generically difficult to obtain from
experimental observables. In this paper we show that the operator size
distribution can be measured in quantum quench experiments. In a quantum spin
system, we propose to prepare an ensemble of initial states which are direct
product states of random pure states of each spin qudit, and measure a simple
physical observable (such as a particular component of spin) at later time $t$.
The initial state dependence of the expectation value measures a particular
component of the operator size distribution. Furthermore, many other features
of the operator size distribution can be measured by analyzing the same data,
such as the support of the operator in space.

absent in the standard edge-triangle model. The present work seeks to classify
the limiting behavior of this generalized edge-triangle exponential random

come from a special class, known as Tur\'an graphons. For $\gamma > 1$, there
are large regions of the parameter space where the limit is not a Tur\'an

Furthermore, for $\gamma$ large enough, the exact edge density of the limiting

the construction of these interventions. In an MRT, each individual is
repeatedly randomized among multiple intervention options, often hundreds or
even thousands of times, over the course of the trial. This work is motivated
by multiple MRTs that have been conducted, or are currently in the field, in
which the primary outcome is a longitudinal binary outcome. The primary aim of
such MRTs is to examine whether a particular time-varying intervention has an
effect on the longitudinal binary outcome, often marginally over all but a
small subset of the individual's data. We propose the definition of causal
excursion effect that can be used in such primary aim analysis for MRTs with
binary outcomes. Under rather restrictive assumptions one can, based on
existing literature, derive a semiparametric, locally efficient estimator of
the causal effect. We, starting from this estimator, develop an estimator that
can be used as the basis of a primary aim analysis under more plausible
assumptions. Simulation studies are conducted to compare the estimators. We
illustrate the developed methods using data from the MRT, BariFit. In BariFit,

familiar, yet equally important correlation-propagation relations (CPR) relate
the correlations of stochastic forces on different detectors to the retarded
and advanced parts of the radiation propagated in the field. Here, we analyze a
system of $N$ uniformly-accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detectors whose internal
degrees of freedom (idf) are minimally coupled to a real, massless, scalar
field in 4D Minkowski space, extending prior work in 2D with derivative
coupling. Using the influence functional formalism, we derive the stochastic
equations describing the nonequilibrium dynamics of the idfs. We show after the
detector-field dynamics has reached equilibration the existence of the FDR and
the CPR for the detectors, which combine to form a {\it generalized}
fluctuation-dissipation matrix relation We show explicitly the energy flows
between the constituents of the system of detectors and between the system and
the quantum field environment. This power balance anchors the generalized FDR.
We anticipate this matrix relation to provide a useful guardrail in expounding
some basic issues in relativistic quantum information, such as ensuring the
self-consistency of the energy balance and tracking the quantum information
transfer in the detector-field system.

design an algorithm that achieves $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3}d^{1/3}_{m^\star})$ regret
with no prior knowledge of the optimal dimension $d_{m^\star}$. The algorithm
also achieves regret $\tilde{O}(T^{3/4} + \sqrt{Td_{m^\star}})$, which is
optimal for $d_{m^{\star}}\geq{}\sqrt{T}$. This is the first model selection
result for contextual bandits with non-vacuous regret for all values of

this type for any online learning setting with partial information. The core of
the algorithm is a new estimator for the gap in the best loss achievable by two
linear policy classes, which we show admits a convergence rate faster than the
rate required to learn the parameters for either class.

instance is associated with a set of candidate labels, among which only one is
correct. Most existing methods deal with such problem by either treating each
candidate label equally or identifying the ground-truth label iteratively. In
this paper, we propose a novel PLL approach called HERA, which simultaneously
incorporates the HeterogEneous Loss and the SpaRse and Low-rAnk procedure to
estimate the labeling confidence for each instance while training the model.
Specifically, the heterogeneous loss integrates the strengths of both the
pairwise ranking loss and the pointwise reconstruction loss to provide
informative label ranking and reconstruction information for label
identification, while the embedded sparse and low-rank scheme constrains the
sparsity of ground-truth label matrix and the low rank of noise label matrix to
explore the global label relevance among the whole training data for improving
the learning model. Extensive experiments on both artificial and real-world
data sets demonstrate that our method can achieve superior or comparable
performance against the state-of-the-art methods.

superlubricity-based ESMGs, two are particularly noticeable. First, they can be
driven by much lower external loads than conventional ESMGs; second, they can
be massively fabricated by using micro-machining processes. The quantitative

theoretically and empirically show that with just more unlabeled data, we can
learn a model with better adversarially robust generalization. The key insight
of our results is based on a risk decomposition theorem, in which the expected
robust risk is separated into two parts: the stability part which measures the
prediction stability in the presence of perturbations, and the accuracy part
which evaluates the standard classification accuracy. As the stability part
does not depend on any label information, we can optimize this part using
unlabeled data. We further prove that for a specific Gaussian mixture problem,
adversarially robust generalization can be almost as easy as the standard
generalization in supervised learning if a sufficiently large amount of
unlabeled data is provided. Inspired by the theoretical findings, we further
show that a practical adversarial training algorithm that leverages unlabeled

model the association between a treatment and a binary outcome as a function of

correspond to log odds ratios, while subject-matter scientists are often

approximate relative risks, this approximation is appropriate only when the
outcome of interest is rare for all levels of the covariates. Poisson
regressions do measure multiplicative treatment effects including relative

direct modeling of the relative risk. The model uses a log odds-product

secure the system against cyber attacks in order to enable mission critical and
real-time applications. To this end, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have
been widely used to detect anomalies caused by a cyber attacker in IoT systems.
However, due to the large-scale nature of the IoT, an IDS must operate in a
distributed manner with minimum dependence on a central controller. Moreover,
in many scenarios such as health and financial applications, the datasets are
private and IoTDs may not intend to share such data. To this end, in this
paper, a distributed generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed to
provide a fully distributed IDS for the IoT so as to detect anomalous behavior
without reliance on any centralized controller. In this architecture, every
IoTD can monitor its own data as well as neighbor IoTDs to detect internal and
external attacks. In addition, the proposed distributed IDS does not require
sharing the datasets between the IoTDs, thus, it can be implemented in IoTs
that preserve the privacy of user data such as health monitoring systems or
financial applications. It is shown analytically that the proposed distributed
GAN has higher accuracy of detecting intrusion compared to a standalone IDS
that has access to only a single IoTD dataset. Simulation results show that,
the proposed distributed GAN-based IDS has up to 20% higher accuracy, 25%
higher precision, and 60% lower false positive rate compared to a standalone

expected return of an arm (or portfolio) with the risk associated with that
return. In this paper, we consider the problem of selecting the arm that
optimizes a linear combination of the expected reward and the associated
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) in a fixed budget best-arm identification
framework. We allow the reward distributions to be unbounded or even
heavy-tailed. For this problem, our goal is to devise algorithms that are
entirely distribution oblivious, i.e., the algorithm is not aware of any
information on the reward distributions, including bounds on the moments/tails,
or the suboptimality gaps across arms.
  In this paper, we provide a class of such algorithms with provable upper
bounds on the probability of incorrect identification. In the process, we
develop a novel estimator for the CVaR of unbounded (including heavy-tailed)
random variables and prove a concentration inequality for the same, which could
be of independent interest. We also compare the error bounds for our

approach based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that represents the problem

vectors generated via synchronized chaotic oscillators. In particular, we
consider the setup where information about data sets, queries, is sent through
public (unsecured) communication channels to a remote station. To hide private
features (specific entries) within the data set, we corrupt the response to
queries by adding random vectors. We send the distorted query (the sum of the
requested query and the random vector) through the public channel. The
distribution of the additive random vector is designed to minimize the mutual
information (our privacy metric) between private entries of the data set and
the distorted query. We cast the synthesis of this distribution as a convex
program in the probabilities of the additive random vector. Once we have the
optimal distribution, we propose an algorithm to generate pseudo-random
realizations from this distribution using trajectories of a chaotic oscillator.
At the other end of the channel, we have a second chaotic oscillator, which we
use to generate realizations from the same distribution. Note that if we obtain
the same realizations on both sides of the channel, we can simply subtract the
realization from the distorted query to recover the requested query. To
generate equal realizations, we need the two chaotic oscillators to be
synchronized, i.e., we need them to generate exactly the same trajectories on
both sides of the channel synchronously in time. We force the two chaotic
oscillators into exponential synchronization using a driving signal.
Simulations are presented to illustrate our results.

tasks with limited labeled data, by leveraging abundant unlabeled data and the
mutual benefit among the multiple styles. A style transfer agent in our system
not only learns from unlabeled data by using techniques like denoising
auto-encoder and back-translation, but also learns to cooperate with other
style transfer agents in a self-organization manner. We conduct our experiments

which reconciles the two different high-order acceleration approaches, one by

the UAF unifies the high-order acceleration instances [29, 3, 33, 15, 16, 25,
19, 6, 14] of the two approaches by only two problem-related parameters and two
additional parameters for framework design. Furthermore, the UAF (and its
analysis) is the first approach to make high-order methods applicable for
high-order smoothness conditions with respect to non-Euclidean norms. If the
function is further uniformly convex, we propose a general restart scheme for
the UAF. The iteration complexities of instances of both the UAF and the
restarted UAF match existing lower bounds in most important cases [2, 16]. For
practical implementation, we introduce a new and effective heuristic that
significantly simplifies the binary search procedure required by the framework.
We use experiments to verify the effectiveness of the heuristic and demonstrate
clear and consistent advantages of high-order acceleration methods over
first-order ones, in terms of run-time complexity. Finally, the UAF is proposed
directly in the general composite convex setting, thus show that the existing

engineering to architecture engineering. However, successful networks today are
constructed using a small and manually defined set of building blocks. Even in
methods of neural architecture search (NAS) the network connectivity patterns
are largely constrained. In this work we propose a method for discovering
neural wirings. We relax the typical notion of layers and instead enable
channels to form connections independent of each other. This allows for a much
larger space of possible networks. The wiring of our network is not fixed
during training -- as we learn the network parameters we also learn the
structure itself. Our experiments demonstrate that our learned connectivity
outperforms hand engineered and randomly wired networks. By learning the
connectivity of MobileNetV1we boost the ImageNet accuracy by 10% at ~41M FLOPs.
Moreover, we show that our method generalizes to recurrent and continuous time
networks. Our work may also be regarded as unifying core aspects of the neural
architecture search problem with sparse neural network learning. As NAS becomes
more fine grained, finding a good architecture is akin to finding a sparse
subnetwork of the complete graph. Accordingly, DNW provides an effective
mechanism for discovering sparse subnetworks of predefined architectures in a
single training run. Though we only ever use a small percentage of the weights

challenging due to the orthonormality constraints on $\textbf{Q}$. To cope with
this problem, we propose a very simple decomposition for orthogonal matrices
which we abbreviate as PLR decomposition. It produces a one-to-one
correspondence between $\textbf{Q}$ and a $\left(d\times d\right)$ unit lower
triangular matrix $\textbf{L}$ whose $d\left(d-1\right)/2$ entries below the

regardless of the objective function under consideration, we can use any
classical unconstrained optimization method to find the minimum (or maximum) of
the objective function with respect to $\textbf{L}$. For illustrative purposes,
we apply the PLR decomposition in common principle components analysis (CPCA)
for the maximum likelihood estimation of the common orthogonal matrix when a
multivariate leptokurtic-normal distribution is assumed in each group. Compared
to the commonly used normal distribution, the leptokurtic-normal has an
additional parameter governing the excess kurtosis; this makes the estimation
of $\textbf{Q}$ in CPCA more robust against mild outliers. The usefulness of
the PLR decomposition in leptokurtic-normal CPCA is illustrated by two

such as revenue, effectiveness, or a quantitative result. In many such tasks,
the point prediction is not enough: the uncertainty (i.e. risk or confidence)
of that prediction must also be estimated. Standard NNs, which are most often
used in such tasks, do not provide uncertainty information. Existing approaches
address this issue by combining Bayesian models with NNs, but these models are
hard to implement, more expensive to train, and usually do not predict as
accurately as standard NNs. In this paper, a new framework (RIO) is developed
that makes it possible to estimate uncertainty in any pretrained standard NN.
The behavior of the NN is captured by modeling its prediction residuals with a
Gaussian Process, whose kernel includes both the NN's input and its output. The
framework is evaluated in twelve real-world datasets, where it is found to (1)
provide reliable estimates of uncertainty, (2) reduce the error of the point
predictions, and (3) scale well to large datasets. Given that RIO can be
applied to any standard NN without modifications to model architecture or

vision applications drives edge detection from category-agnostic to
category-aware semantic level. However, finer delineation of instance-level
boundaries still remains unexcavated. In this work, we address a new
finer-grained task, termed panoptic edge detection (PED), which aims at
predicting semantic-level boundaries for stuff categories and instance-level
boundaries for instance categories, in order to provide more comprehensive and
unified scene understanding from the perspective of edges.We then propose a
versatile framework, Panoptic Edge Network (PEN), which aggregates different
tasks of object detection, semantic and instance edge detection into a single
holistic network with multiple branches. Based on the same feature
representation, the semantic edge branch produces semantic-level boundaries for
all categories and the object detection branch generates instance proposals.
Conditioned on the prior information from these two branches, the instance edge
branch aims at instantiating edge predictions for instance categories. Besides,
we also devise a Panoptic Dual F-measure (F2) metric for the new PED task to
uniformly measure edge prediction quality for both stuff and instances. By
joint end-to-end training, the proposed PEN framework outperforms all
competitive baselines on Cityscapes and ADE20K datasets.

high parallelization and strong performance on a variety of NLP tasks, e.g.
machine translation. Due to the lack of recurrence structure such as recurrent
neural networks (RNN), SAN is ascribed to be weak at learning positional
information of words for sequence modeling. However, neither this speculation
has been empirically confirmed, nor explanations for their strong performances
on machine translation tasks when ""lacking positional information"" have been
explored. To this end, we propose a novel word reordering detection task to
quantify how well the word order information learned by SAN and RNN.
Specifically, we randomly move one word to another position, and examine
whether a trained model can detect both the original and inserted positions.
Experimental results reveal that: 1) SAN trained on word reordering detection
indeed has difficulty learning the positional information even with the
position embedding; and 2) SAN trained on machine translation learns better
positional information than its RNN counterpart, in which position embedding
plays a critical role. Although recurrence structure make the model more
universally-effective on learning word order, learning objectives matter more
in the downstream tasks such as machine translation.

ratio deviates from unity in the nuclei near $\beta$-stability line and in
neutron-rich nuclei. Thus, more neutron-rich objects with $N>Z$ could become
the building blocks of cluster structures in such nuclei. The $^{14}$C nucleus
is strongly bound and can be regarded as such a candidate. In addition, the
path to the lowest shell-model configuration at short relative distances is
closed for the $^{14}$C+$^{14}$C structure contrary to the case of the
$^{12}$C+$^{12}$C structure; this allows to keep appreciable separation
distance between the $^{14}$C clusters. The recent development of
antisymmetrized quasi-cluster model (AQCM) allows us to utilize $jj$-coupling

results for the $^{14}$C+$^{14}$C structure in $^{28}$Mg are compared with the
ones of cranked relativistic mean field (CRMF) calculations. Although
theoretical frameworks of these two models are quite different, they give
similar results for the nucleonic densities and rotational properties of the

characterizing the swimmer orientation dynamics (of O($D^{-1}_r$)) and those
that characterize migration across the channel (of O($H^{2}D_r/U^{2}_b$)),
allows for use of the method of multiple scales to derive a drift-diffusion
equation for the swimmer concentration profile; here, $U_b$ is the swimming
speed, $H$ is the channel half-width, and $D_r$ is the swimmer rotary
diffusivity. The steady state concentration profile is a function of the
P\'eclet number, $Pe = U_{f}/(D_r H)$ ($U_f$ being the channel centerline
velocity), and the swimmer aspect ratio $\kappa$. Swimmers with $ \kappa \gg 1$
(with $ \kappa \sim$ O(1)), in the regime $1 \ll \textit{Pe} \ll \kappa^3$
($Pe\sim$ O(1)), migrate towards the channel walls, corresponding to a
high-shear trapping behavior. For $Pe \gg \kappa^3 $ ($Pe \gg $ 1 for $\kappa

a low-shear trapping behavior. Interestingly, within the low-shear trapping
regime, swimmers with $\kappa < 2$ asymptote to a $Pe$-independent
concentration profile for large $Pe$, while those with $\kappa \geq 2$ exhibit
a `centerline-collapse' for $Pe \to \infty$. The prediction of
low-shear-trapping, validated by Langevin simulations, is the first explanation
of recent experimental observations [Barry $\textit{et al}$. (2015)]. We
organize the high-shear and low-shear trapping regimes on a $Pe-\kappa$ plane,

magnetar, the strong magnetic field deforms the star, making it axisymmetric
with respect to the magnetic axis (the body symmetry axis). In magnetars, the
rotation axis is tilted to the magnetic axis, and we have an oblique rotator.
General relativistic treatment of the obliquely rotating magnetar gives rise to
frame-dragging velocities both in the azimuthal and polar direction. Solving
the Einstein equation up to first-order perturbation in rotation and
second-order perturbation in the magnetic field, we calculate the geodesic of a
particle near the star's surface. The polar frame-dragging velocity makes the
particle orbit non-planar, and the particle moves both along the azimuthal and
polar direction for a fixed radial distance. The extent of particle deviation
from planar orbit depends on the magnetic field strength and the misalignment
angle. We find that the continuous gravitational wave emitted from such
obliquely rotating axisymmetric star is non zero, and for small misalignment
angle, the gravitational wave amplitude depends more on the azimuthal
frame-dragging velocity. In contrast, for a large misalignment angle, the polar
frame-dragging velocity dominates. The energy loss from such a misaligned
rotator depends more significantly on the polar frame-dragging velocity and
therefore, can significantly affect the magnetosphere around a magnetar.

believed to be fine-tuned to a high degree. Such fine-tuning is suggested by
the unusually strong temperature dependence of the triple-alpha reaction rate
at stellar temperatures. This sensitivity is due to the resonant character of
the triple-alpha process, which proceeds through the so-called ""Hoyle state"" of
$^{12}$C with spin-parity $0^+$. The question of fine-tuning can be studied
within the {\it ab initio} framework of nuclear lattice effective field theory,
which makes it possible to relate {\it ad hoc} changes in the energy of the
Hoyle state to changes in the fundamental parameters of the nuclear
Hamiltonian, which are the light quark mass $m_q$ and the electromagnetic
fine-structure constant. Here, we update the effective field theory calculation
of the sensitivity of the triple-alpha process to small changes in the
fundamental parameters. In particular, we consider recent high-precision
lattice QCD calculations of the nucleon axial coupling $g_A$, as well as new
and more comprehensive results from stellar simulations of the production of
carbon and oxygen. While the updated stellar simulations allow for much larger
{\it ad hoc} shifts in the Hoyle state energy than previously thought, recent

lengths now disfavor the scenario of no fine-tuning in the light quark mass

equilibrium media throughout the physical, chemical, and biological sciences.
However, many real world systems, particularly biological ones, are
intrinsically out-of-equilibrium due to the energy-dissipating active processes
underlying their mechanical and dynamical features. The diffusion process
followed by a passive tracer in prototypical active media such as suspensions
of active colloids or swimming microorganisms indeed differs significantly from
Brownian motion, manifest in a greatly enhanced diffusion coefficient,
non-Gaussian tails of the displacement statistics, and crossover phenomena from
non-Gaussian to Gaussian scaling. While such characteristic features have been
extensively observed in experiments, there is so far no comprehensive theory
explaining how they emerge from the microscopic active dynamics. Here we
present a theoretical framework of the enhanced tracer diffusion in an active
medium from its microscopic dynamics by coarse-graining the hydrodynamic
interactions between the tracer and the active particles as a stochastic
process. The tracer is shown to follow a non-Markovian coloured Poisson process
that accounts quantitatively for all empirical observations. The theory
predicts in particular a long-lived L\'evy flight regime of the tracer motion
with a non-monotonic crossover between two different power-law exponents. The
duration of this regime can be tuned by the swimmer density, thus suggesting
that the optimal foraging strategy of swimming microorganisms might crucially
depend on the density in order to exploit the L\'evy flights of nutrients. Our
framework provides the first validation of the celebrated L\'evy flight model

In this paper, we present a novel model compression approach based on

student FCNs are trained at lower image resolutions than that of teacher FCN.
We explored three different approaches to train student FCNs: knowledge
transfer (KT), knowledge distillation (KD) and their combination. Experimental
evaluation on LFW and IJB-C datasets demonstrate comparable improvements in
accuracies with these approaches. Training low-resolution student FCNs from
higher resolution teacher offer fourfold advantage of accelerated training,
accelerated inference, reduced memory requirements and improved accuracies. We
evaluated all models on IJB-C dataset and achieved state-of-the-art results on
this benchmark. The teacher network and some student networks even achieved
Top-1 performance on IJB-C dataset. The proposed approach is simple and
hardware friendly, thus enables the deployment of high performing face

long-term delay-power tradeoff in vehicular communications. At each decision
epoch, the road side unit observes the global network state, allocates channels
and schedules data packets for all vehicle user equipment-pairs (VUE-pairs).
The decision-making procedure is modelled as a discrete-time Markov decision
process (MDP). The technical challenges in solving an optimal control policy
originate from highly spatial mobility of vehicles and temporal variations in
data traffic. To simplify the decision-making process, we first decompose the
MDP into a series of per-VUE-pair MDPs. We then propose an online long
short-term memory based deep reinforcement learning algorithm to break the
curse of high dimensionality in state space faced by each per-VUE-pair MDP.
With the proposed algorithm, the optimal channel allocation and packet
scheduling decision at each epoch can be made in a decentralized way in
accordance with the partial observations of the global network state at the
VUE-pairs. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analysis and show the
effectiveness of the proposed online learning algorithm.

pitchfork bifurcation point serves as the critical point. The dynamical

with a period of $\sim$ 1.5 s and a pulsed fraction of $\sim$ 5%. We use Monte
Carlo simulations to demonstrate that the individual detections are unlikely to
originate in false Poisson noise detections given their very close frequencies;
their strong similarity to other pulsations detected from ULXs also argues they
are real. The presence of a large bubble nebula surrounding NGC 1313 X-2
implies an age of order 1 Myr for the accreting phase of the ULX, which implies
that the neutron star's magnetic field has not been suppressed over time by
accreted material, nor has the neutron star collapsed into a black hole,
despite an average energy output into the nebula two orders of magnitude above

over the lifetime of the ULX, favouring physical models including strong winds

efficiently calculated without any intermediate step or model, and a
variational learning method can then be employed to optimize the classifier

improved by incorporating a margin maximizing loss function. We illustrate the

experiments to detect light flashes (e.g. fluorescence or Cherenkov light) from
extensive air showers (EASs) initiated by statistically rare very high energy
cosmic particles when travelling through the atmosphere. Their high
amplification factor (gain) allows the detection of very low photon fluxes down
to single photons. At the same time this sensitivity causes the gain and
signal-to-noise ratio to decrease with collected charge over the lifetime of
the PMT (referred to as ""ageing""). To avoid fast ageing, many experiments limit
the PMT operation to reasonably low night sky background (NSB) conditions.
However, in order to collect more event statistics at the highest energies, it
is desirable to extend the measurement cycle into (part of) nights with higher
NSB levels. In case the signal-to-noise ratio remains large enough in the
subsequent reconstruction of the EAS events, lowering the PMT gain in such
conditions can be an option to avoid faster ageing. In this paper, performance
studies under high NSB with Photonis XP3062 PMTs, as used in the fluorescence
detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory, are presented. The results suggest
that lowering the PMT gain by a factor of 10 while increasing the NSB level by
a similar factor does not significantly affect the PMT performance and ageing
behaviour so that detection and offline reconstruction of EASs are still
possible. Adjusting the PMT gain according to a changing NSB level throughout a
night has been shown to be possible and it follows a predictable behaviour.
This allows to extend the measurement cycles of experiments, based on PMTs of
type Photonis XP3062 or comparable and exposed to the NSB, to enhance the
sensitivity especially at the highest energies where events are very rare.

first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that significant DMI can be

which the difference between X and Y on the opposites sides of Mn breaks the
inversion symmetry. In particular, the DMI amplitudes of MnSeTe and MnSTe are
comparable to those of state-of-the-art ferromagnet/heavy metal (FM/HM)
heterostructures. In addition, by performing Monte Carlo simulations, we find
that at low temperatures the ground states of the MnSeTe and MnSTe monolayers
can transform from ferromagnetic states with worm-like magnetic domains into
the skyrmion states by applying external magnetic field. At increasing
temperature, the skyrmion states starts fluctuating above 50 K before an
evolution to a completely disordered structure at higher temperature. The
present results pave the way for new device concepts utilizing chiral magnetic

naively updating a model with new data(sets) results in a degradation of
already learned tasks, which is referred to as ""catastrophic forgetting."" We
develop a generative replay procedure for generating training audio spectrogram

incrementally refining a classifier with generative replay a generator that is
4% of the size of all previous training data matches the performance of
refining the classifier keeping 20% of all previous training data. We thus
conclude that we can extend a trained sound classifier to learn new classes

solving the respective Bethe ansatz equations for large system sizes allowing
us to uncover the low-lying critical exponents. We present evidences that
critical exponents appear to be built in terms of composites of anomalous
dimensions of two Coulomb gases with distinct radii and the exponents
associated to $Z(2)$ degrees of freedom. This view is supported by the fact
that the $S=1$ XXZ integrable chain spectrum is present in some of the sectors
of our superspin chain at a particular value of the deformation parameter. We
find that the fine structure of finite-size effects is very rich for a typical
anisotropic spin chain. In fact, we argue on the existence of a family of
states with the same conformal dimension whose lattice degeneracies are
apparently lifted by logarithmic corrections. On the other hand we also report
on states of the spectrum whose finite-size corrections seem to be governed by
a power law behaviour. We finally observe that under toroidal boundary

realistic information about the effects of energy production and consumption to
assess grid stability.
  Recently, research in scenario planning benefits from utilizing generative
adversarial networks (GANs) as generative models for operational scenario
planning.
  In these scenarios, operators examine temporal as well as spatial influences
of different energy sources on the grid.
  The analysis of how renewable energy resources affect the grid enables the
operators to evaluate the stability and to identify potential weak points such
as a limiting transformer.
  However, due to their novelty, there are limited studies on how well GANs
model the underlying power distribution.
  This analysis is essential because, e.g., especially extreme situations with
low or high power generation are required to evaluate grid stability.
  We conduct a comparative study of the Wasserstein distance,
binary-cross-entropy loss, and a Gaussian copula as the baseline applied on two
wind and two solar datasets with limited data compared to previous studies.
  Both GANs achieve good results considering the limited amount of data, but
the Wasserstein GAN is superior in modeling temporal and spatial relations, and
the power distribution.
  Besides evaluating the generated power distribution over all farms, it is
essential to assess terrain specific distributions for wind scenarios.
  These terrain specific power distributions affect the grid by their
differences in their generating power magnitude.
  Therefore, in a second study, we show that even when simultaneously learning
distributions from wind parks with terrain specific patterns, GANs are capable
of modeling these individualities also when faced with limited data.

couplings to other particles can be candidates for fuzzy dark matter (FDM) if
the axion decay constant $f_a\sim 10^{17}GeV$. If a compact star is immersed in
such a low mass axionic potential it develops a long range field outside the
star. This axionic field is radiated away when the star is in a binary orbit.
The orbital period of a compact binary decays mainly due to the gravitational
wave radiation, which was confirmed first in the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar.
The orbital period can also decay by radiation of other light particles like
axions and axion like particles(ALPs). For axionic radiation to take place, the
orbital frequency of the periodic motion of the binary system should be greater
than the mass of the scalar particle which can be radiated. This implies that,
for most of the observed binaries, particles with mass $m_a< 10^{-19}eV$ can be
radiated, which includes FDM particles. In this paper, we consider four compact
binary systems: PSR J0348+0432, PSR J0737-3039, PSR J1738+0333, and PSR
B1913+16 (Hulse Taylor Binary) and show that the observations of the decay in

TRAPPIST-1. Thanks to transit-timing variations, the masses and therefore the
bulk densities of the planets have been constrained, suggesting that all
TRAPPIST-1 planets are consistent with water mass fractions on the order of
10%. These water fractions, as well as the similar planet masses within the
system, constitute strong constraints on the origins of the TRAPPIST-1 system.
In a previous work, we outlined a pebble-driven formation scenario. In this
paper we investigate this formation scenario in more detail. We used a
Lagrangian smooth-particle method to model the growth and drift of pebbles and
the conversion of pebbles to planetesimals through the streaming instability.
We used the N-body code \texttt{MERCURY} to follow the composition of
planetesimals as they grow into protoplanets by merging and accreting pebbles.
This code is adapted to account for pebble accretion, type-I migration, and gas
drag. In this way, we modelled the entire planet formation process (pertaining
to planet masses and compositions, not dynamical configuration). We find that
planetesimals form in a single, early phase of streaming instability. The
initially narrow annulus of planetesimals outside the snowline quickly broadens
due to scattering. Our simulation results confirm that this formation pathway
indeed leads to similarly-sized planets and is highly efficient in turning
pebbles into planets ($\sim$50% solids-to-planets conversion efficiency). [...]
The water content of planets resulting from our simulations is on the order of
10%, and our results predict a `V-shaped' trend in the planet water fraction
with orbital distance: from relatively high (innermost planets) to relatively
low (intermediate planets) to relatively high (outermost planets).

Cesa-Bianchi et al. [2019] in the case of variable, but bounded delays. Here,
$K$ is the number of actions and $D$ is the total delay over $T$ rounds. We
then introduce a new algorithm that lifts the requirement of bounded delays by
using a wrapper that skips rounds with excessively large delays. The new
algorithm maintains the same regret bound, but similar to its predecessor
requires prior knowledge of $D$ and $T$. For this algorithm we then construct a
novel doubling scheme that forgoes the prior knowledge requirement under the
assumption that the delays are available at action time (rather than at loss
observation time). This assumption is satisfied in a broad range of
applications, including interaction with servers and service providers. The
resulting oracle regret bound is of order $\min_\beta (|S_\beta|+\beta \ln K +
(KT + D_\beta)/\beta)$, where $|S_\beta|$ is the number of observations with
delay exceeding $\beta$, and $D_\beta$ is the total delay of observations with
delay below $\beta$. The bound relaxes to $O (\sqrt{(KT + D)\ln K} )$, but we
also provide examples where $D_\beta \ll D$ and the oracle bound has a
polynomially better dependence on the problem parameters.

generative semantic hashing approach, \textit{Ranking based Semantic Hashing}
(RBSH) that consists of both a variational and a ranking based component.
Similarly to variational autoencoders, the variational component is trained to
reconstruct the original document conditioned on its generated hash code, and
as in prior work, it only considers documents individually. The ranking
component solves this limitation by incorporating inter-document similarity
into the hash code generation, modelling document ranking through a hinge loss.
To circumvent the need for labelled data to compute the hinge loss, we use a
weak labeller and thus keep the approach fully unsupervised.
  Extensive experimental evaluation on four publicly available datasets against
traditional baselines and recent state-of-the-art methods for semantic hashing
shows that RBSH significantly outperforms all other methods across all
evaluated hash code lengths. In fact, RBSH hash codes are able to perform
similarly to state-of-the-art hash codes while using 2-4x fewer bits.

with high quality and naturalness, while its generalization to out-of-domain
texts is still a challenging task, with regard to the design of attention-based
sequence-to-sequence acoustic modeling. Various errors occur in those inputs
with unseen context, including attention collapse, skipping, repeating, etc.,
which limits the broader applications. In this paper, we propose a novel
stepwise monotonic attention method in sequence-to-sequence acoustic modeling
to improve the robustness on out-of-domain inputs. The method utilizes the
strict monotonic property in TTS with constraints on monotonic hard attention
that the alignments between inputs and outputs sequence must be not only
monotonic but allowing no skipping on inputs. Soft attention could be used to
evade mismatch between training and inference. The experimental results show
that the proposed method could achieve significant improvements in robustness
on out-of-domain scenarios for phoneme-based models, without any regression on
the in-domain naturalness test.

failures or flaky test failures affects developers' perceptions about what is
test flakiness. Prior research on test flakiness has been limited to test
smells and tools to detect test flakiness. In this paper, we have conducted a
multiple case study with four different industries in Scandinavia to understand
practitioners' perceptions about test flakiness and how this varies between
industries. We observed that there are little differences in how the
practitioners perceive test flakiness. We identified 23 factors that are
perceived to affect test flakiness. These perceived factors are categorized as
1) Software test quality, 2) Software Quality, 3) Actual Flaky test and 4)
Company-specific factors. We have studied the nature of effects such as whether
factors increase, decrease or affect the ability to detect test flakiness. We
validated our findings with different participants of the 4 companies to avoid

While properly using auxiliary supervision can improve model accuracy to some

synergy loss, which considers pairwise knowledge matching among all supervision

DKS on image classification datasets using state-of-the-art CNN architectures,

an electric field with realistic field strengths which then can be propagated

oscillations of the population rate. Oscillatory input can frequency-entrain

<2.5. For all objects, the star formation rate (SFR) and dust mass were derived

molecular-to-atomic gas mass ratio (MH2/MHI), gas-to-dust mass ratio and SFE

overall moderate enhancements (~2x) in both molecular gas fraction (MH2/M*),

major-merger pairs compared to non-interacting comparison samples, whereas no
enhancement was found for the SFE nor for the total gas mass fraction
(MHI+MH2)/M*. When divided into S+S and S+E, low mass and high mass, and with

difference in MH2/M*, and strong differences in MH2/MHI between subsamples. For
MH2/MHI, the difference between S+S and S+E subsamples is 0.69+-0.16 dex and
between pairs with and without interaction signs is 0.53+-0.18 dex. Together,
our results suggest (1) star formation enhancement in close major-merger pairs
occurs mainly in S+S pairs after the first close encounter (indicated by
interaction signs) because the HI gas is compressed into star-forming molecular
gas by the tidal torque; (2) this effect is much weakened in the S+E pairs.

observations (~30 GHz) provide detections of a range of molecular transitions
that trace different physics, such as CO isotopologues, sulphur-bearing

differences between different groups of species. For example, the CO
isotopologues and sulphur-bearing species show a rotational profile and are
tracing the larger-scale circumbinary disc structure, while CN, DCN, and
carbon-chain molecules peak at the southern edge of the disc at blue-shifted
velocities. In addition, the cold gas tracer DCO+ is seen beyond the extent of
the circumbinary disc. The detected molecular transitions can be grouped into
three main components: cold regions far from the system, the circumbinary disc,
and a UV-irradiated region likely associated with the surface layers of the
disc that are reached by the UV radiation from the sources. The different
components are consistent with the temperature structure derived from the ratio
of two H2CO transitions, that is, warm temperatures are seen towards the
outflow direction, lukewarm temperatures are associated with the UV-radiated
region, and cold temperatures are related with the circumbinary disc structure.
The chemistry towards IRS 67 shares similarities with both Class 0 and Class II
sources, possibly due to the high gas column density and the strong UV
radiation arising from the binary system. IRS 67 is, therefore, highlighting
the intermediate chemistry between deeply embedded sources and T-Tauri discs.

They can be described by means of semigroup dynamics interrupted by jumps,
separated by independently distributed time intervals, following suitable
waiting time distributions. In this framework, one can further introduce
modified processes, in which the first few events follow different
distributions. A crucial role, marking an important difference with respect to
the classical case, is played by operator ordering. Indeed, for the same choice
of basic quantum transformations, different quantum dynamics arise. In
particular, for the case of modified processes, it is natural to consider the
time inverted operator ordering, in which the last few events are distributed

learning (CL) is less difficult for this class of models thanks to a simple key
feature: instead of recalling the input-output relations of all previously seen
data, task-conditioned hypernetworks only require rehearsing task-specific
weight realizations, which can be maintained in memory using a simple
regularizer. Besides achieving state-of-the-art performance on standard CL
benchmarks, additional experiments on long task sequences reveal that
task-conditioned hypernetworks display a very large capacity to retain previous
memories. Notably, such long memory lifetimes are achieved in a compressive
regime, when the number of trainable hypernetwork weights is comparable or
smaller than target network size. We provide insight into the structure of
low-dimensional task embedding spaces (the input space of the hypernetwork) and

detecting content-adaptive steganography. At the same time, recent works have
shown that, by adopting an approach similar to that used to build adversarial
examples, a steganographer can adopt an adversarial embedding strategy to
effectively counter a target CNN steganalyzer. In turn, the good performance of
the steganalyzer can be restored by retraining the CNN with adversarial stego
images. A problem with this model is that, arguably, at training time the
steganalizer is not aware of the exact parameters used by the steganograher for
adversarial embedding and, vice versa, the steganographer does not know how the
images that will be used to train the steganalyzer are generated. In order to
exit this apparent deadlock, we introduce a game theoretic framework wherein
the problem of setting the parameters of the steganalyzer and the
steganographer is solved in a strategic way. More specifically, a non-zero sum
game is first formulated to model the problem, and then instantiated by
considering a specific adversarial embedding scheme setting its operating
parameters in a game-theoretic fashion. Our analysis shows that the equilibrium
solution of the non zero-sum game can be conveniently found by solving an
associated zero-sum game, thus reducing greatly the complexity of the problem.
Then we run several experiments to derive the optimum strategies for the
steganographer and the staganalyst in a game-theoretic sense, and to evaluate
the performance of the game at the equilibrium, characterizing the loss with
respect to the conventional non-adversarial case. Eventually, by leveraging on
the analysis of the equilibrium point of the game, we introduce a new strategy
to improve the reliability of the steganalysis, which shows the benefits of
addressing the security issue in a game-theoretic perspective.

may not generalize to unseen data. To study how robustness generalizes, recent
works assume that the inputs have bounded $\ell_2$-norm in order to bound the
adversarial risk for $\ell_\infty$ attacks with no explicit dimension
dependence. In this work we focus on $\ell_\infty$ attacks on $\ell_\infty$
bounded inputs and prove margin-based bounds. Specifically, we use a
compression based approach that relies on efficiently compressing the set of
tunable parameters without distorting the adversarial risk. To achieve this, we
apply the concept of effective sparsity and effective joint sparsity on the
weight matrices of neural networks. This leads to bounds with no explicit
dependence on the input dimension, neither on the number of classes. Our
results show that neural networks with approximately sparse weight matrices not

calculate correlation functions for three lattice spacing values and an array

Using the HISQ formalism for all quarks means that the lattice current coupling
to the $W$ can be renormalized non-perturbatively, giving a result free from
perturbative matching errors for the first time. Our results are in agreement
with, and more accurate than, previous determinations of these form factors.
From the form factors we also determine the ratio of branching fractions that

D_s \tau \nu_{\tau})/\mathcal{B}(B_s\to D_s \ell \nu_{l})$, where $\ell$ is an
electron or a muon. We find $R(D_s) = 0.2987(46)$, which is also more accurate

two subsystems such that the gas flow is independent of the liquid flow, and
the liquid flow is described by a conservation law parametrized by the mass
fraction of gas. When solving these equations numerically, we propose to
stagger the gas and liquid variables with respect to each other. The advantage
of this is that in finite volume methods one can use numerical flux functions
designed for 2x2 systems of hyperbolic conservation laws to solve both the gas
flow and the liquid flow, rather than a much more complicated numerical flux
for the whole 4x4 system. We test this using the Roe numerical flux for both

  Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing Systems","The paper has been accepted for publication by IEEE Transactions on
  Wireless Communications (April 2020)",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, edge service caching refers to
pre-storing the necessary programs for executing computation tasks at MEC
servers. At resource-constrained edge servers, service caching placement is in
general a complicated problem that highly correlates to the offloading
decisions of computation tasks. In this paper, we consider a single edge server
that assists a mobile user (MU) in executing a sequence of computation tasks.
In particular, the MU can run its customized programs at the edge server, while
the server can selectively cache the previously generated programs for future
service reuse. To minimize the computation delay and energy consumption of the
MU, we formulate a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) that jointly
optimizes the service caching placement, computation offloading, and system
resource allocation. We first derive the closed-form expressions of the optimal
resource allocation, and subsequently transform the MINLP into an equivalent
pure 0-1 integer linear programming (ILP). To further reduce the complexity in
solving the ILP, we exploit the underlying structures in optimal solutions, and
devise a reduced-complexity alternating minimization technique to update the
caching placement and offloading decision alternately. Simulations show that
the proposed techniques achieve substantial resource savings compared to other
representative benchmark methods.

representation out of which an audible waveform is generated. The latest and

avoided as intermediate acoustic representations are discarded. Another
important dimension of study apart from naturalness is their adaptability to
generate voice from new speakers that were unseen during training. In this
paper we first propose the use of problem-agnostic speech embeddings in a
multi-speaker acoustic model for TTS based on SampleRNN. This way we feed the
acoustic model with speaker acoustically dependent representations that enrich
the waveform generation more than discrete embeddings unrelated to these
factors. Our first results suggest that the proposed embeddings lead to better
quality voices than those obtained with discrete embeddings. Furthermore, as we
can use any speech segment as an encoded representation during inference, the
model is capable to generalize to new speaker identities without retraining the

embedding extractor, we dramatically reduce the spectral distortion to close
the gap towards the target identities.

of the partial derivatives of the continuous WT, which results in
phase-magnitude relationships similar to the short-time Fourier transform
(STFT) setting and valid for the generalized family of Cauchy wavelets. We show
that the existence of such relations is equivalent to analyticity of the WT up
to a multiplicative weight and a scaling of the mother wavelet. The
implementation of the new phaseless reconstruction method is considered in
detail and compared to previous methods. It is shown that the proposed method
provides significant performance gains and a great flexibility regarding
accuracy versus complexity. Additionally, we discuss the relation between

significant levels of discriminative biases such as gender, racial or ethnic

method that preserves non-discriminative gender-related information, while
removing stereotypical discriminative gender biases from pre-trained word
embeddings. Specifically, we consider four types of information:
\emph{feminine}, \emph{masculine}, \emph{gender-neutral} and
\emph{stereotypical}, which represent the relationship between gender vs. bias,
and propose a debiasing method that (a) preserves the gender-related

gender-neutral words, and (c) removes the biases from stereotypical words.
Experimental results on several previously proposed benchmark datasets show
that our proposed method can debias pre-trained word embeddings better than

sources initially selected as promising high-redshift radio galaxy (HzRG)
candidates. We have determined redshifts for a total of 13 radio galaxies with
redshifts ranging from $0.52\le z \le 5.72$. Our sample probes radio
luminosities that are almost an order of magnitude fainter than previous large
samples at the highest redshifts. We use near-infrared photometry for a
subsample of these galaxies to calculate stellar masses using simple stellar
population models, and find stellar masses to be in the range $10^{10.8} -
10^{11.7} M_\odot$. We then compare our faint radio galaxies with brighter
radio galaxies at $z\ge2$ from the literature. We find that fainter radio
galaxies have lower Ly$\alpha$ luminosities and narrower full width at half
maxima compared to the bright ones, implying photoionisation by weaker AGN. We
also rule out the presence of strong shocks in faint HzRGs. The stellar masses
determined for faint HzRGs are lower than what has been observed for brighter
ones. We find that faint HzRG population in the redshift range $2-4$ forms a
bridge between star-forming and narrow-line AGN, whereas the ones at $z>4$ are
dominated by star-formation, and may be building up their stellar mass through
cold accretion of gas. Finally, we show that the overall redshift evolution of
radio sizes at $z>2$ is fully compatible with increased inverse Compton
scattering losses at high redshifts.

prime significance to predict their collective outcomes. Leveraging a
large-scale dataset from a knowledge-sharing website, this paper presents an
exploratory investigation of the way to depict structural diversity in directed
networks and how it can be utilized to predict one's online social reputation.
To capture the structural diversity of an individual, we first consider the
number of weakly and strongly connected components in one's contact
neighborhood and further take the coexposure network of social neighbors into
consideration. We show empirical evidence that the structural diversity of an
individual is able to provide valuable insights to predict personal online
social reputation, and the inclusion of a coexposure network provides an
additional ingredient to achieve that goal. After synthetically controlling
several possible confounding factors through matching experiments, structural
diversity still plays a nonnegligible role in the prediction of personal online
social reputation. Our work constitutes one of the first attempts to
empirically study structural diversity in directed networks and has practical

The method is valid in two and three space dimensions, delivers an inf-sup

Because the EP can amplify the perturbation induced by the qubit and the

contribution is three-fold. First, this work proposes a two-layer architecture
to solve the large-scale load balancing problem in a self-organized manner. The
proposed architecture can alleviate the global traffic variations by
dynamically grouping small cells into self-organized clusters according to
their historical loads, and further adapt to local traffic variations through
intra-cluster load balancing afterwards. Second, for the intra-cluster load
balancing, this paper proposes an off-policy DRL-based MLB algorithm to
autonomously learn the optimal MLB policy under an asynchronous parallel
learning framework, without any prior knowledge assumed over the underlying UDN
environments. Moreover, the algorithm enables joint exploration with multiple
behavior policies, such that the traditional MLB methods can be used to guide
the learning process thereby improving the learning efficiency and stability.
Third, this work proposes an offline-evaluation based safeguard mechanism to
ensure that the online system can always operate with the optimal and
well-trained MLB policy, which not only stabilizes the online performance but
also enables the exploration beyond current policies to make full use of
machine learning in a safe way. Empirical results verify that the proposed
framework outperforms the existing MLB methods in general UDN environments
featured with irregular network topologies, coupled interferences, and random
user movements, in terms of the load balancing performance.

transmitted, and the distance to the critical point. Here we employ stochastic
simulations of a driven 2D Ising system and study the instantaneous mutual
information and the information transmission rate between a driven input spin
and an output spin. The instantaneous mutual information varies
non-monotonically with the temperature, but increases monotonically with the
correlation time of the input signal. In contrast, the information transmission
rate exhibits a maximum as a function of the input correlation time. Moreover,
there exists an optimal temperature that maximizes this maximum information
transmission rate. It arises from a tradeoff between the necessity to respond
fast to changes in the input so that more information per unit amount of time
can be transmitted, and the need to respond to reliably. The optimal
temperature lies above the critical point, but moves towards it as the distance
between the input and output spin is increased.

beamforming technique. We assume that the BS is serving a multi-antenna aided
user equipment (UE) operating in a mmWave channel, which in the meantime
actively detects multiple targets. Note that part of the targets also play the
role of scatterers for the communication signal. Given this framework, we
propose a novel scheme for joint target search and communication channel
estimation relying on the omni-directional pilot signals generated by the HAD
structure. Given a fully-digital communication precoder and a desired radar
transmit beampattern, we propose to design the analog and digital precoders
under non-convex constant-modulus (CM) and power constraints, such that the BS
can formulate narrow beams towards all the targets, while pre-equalizing the
impact of the communication channel. Furthermore, we design an HAD receiver
that can simultaneously process signals from the UE and echo waves from the
targets. By tracking the angular variation of the targets, we show that it is
possible to recover the target echoes and mitigate the potential interference
imposed on the UE signals by invoking the successive interference cancellation
(SIC) technique, even when the radar and communication signals share the
equivalent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The feasibility and the efficiency of
the proposed approaches in realizing DFRC are verified via numerical

turbulence in preheating we have started in Refs. [1, 2] but considering
several classes of inflationary two-fields models. We exhibit the main elements
of the wave turbulence phase imprinted in the power spectra of relevant
quantities in the time and space domains. As a general feature, the power
spectra resemble in their structure to those obtained using the single
nonminimally coupled scalar field of the previous work. As a consequence, we
obtained an estimate of the temperature corresponding to the thermalized phase
from the power spectrum of the total energy density. Another feature allowed by
the simulations was the determination of the effective equation of state after
taking into account the backreaction of the produced particles.

effectively separate the information, we propose to use a combination of

possibility of using semi-supervised learning for an effective disentangling
even using few labels. We leverage the linearization property of the latent

Assimilation (state estimation), proposed in [Y Maday, AT Patera, JD Penn, M
Yano, Int J Numer Meth Eng, 102(5), 933-965]. The PBDW algorithm is a state
estimation method involving reduced models. It aims at approximating an unknown
function $u^{\rm true}$ living in a high-dimensional Hilbert space from $M$
measurement observations given in the form $y_m = \ell_m(u^{\rm true}),\,
m=1,\dots,M$, where $\ell_m$ are linear functionals. The method approximates
$u^{\rm true}$ with $\hat{u} = \hat{z} + \hat{\eta}$. The \emph{background}
$\hat{z}$ belongs to an $N$-dimensional linear space $\mathcal{Z}_N$ built from
reduced modelling of a parameterized mathematical model, and the \emph{update}
$\hat{\eta}$ belongs to the space $\mathcal{U}_M$ spanned by the Riesz
representers of $(\ell_1,\dots, \ell_M)$. When the measurements are noisy {---
i.e., $y_m = \ell_m(u^{\rm true})+\epsilon_m$ with $\epsilon_m$ being a noise
term --- } the classical PBDW formulation is not robust in the sense that, if
$N$ increases, the reconstruction accuracy degrades. In this paper, we propose
to address this issue with an extension of the classical formulation, {which
consists in} searching for the background $\hat{z}$ either on the whole
$\mathcal{Z}_N$ in the noise-free case, or on a well-chosen subset
$\mathcal{K}_N \subset \mathcal{Z}_N$ in presence of noise. The restriction to
$\mathcal{K}_N$ makes the reconstruction be nonlinear and is the key to make
the algorithm significantly more robust against noise. We {further} present an
\emph{a priori} error and stability analysis, and we illustrate the efficiency
of the approach on several numerical examples.

reaches an absolute magnitude of Mg=-15.46+-0.15 mag and a bolometric
luminosity of 5.5x10^41 erg/s. Its light curve has the double-peak shape
typical of Luminous Red Novae (LRNe), with a narrow first peak bright in the
blue bands, while the second peak is longer lasting and more luminous in the
red and near-infrared (NIR) bands. During the first peak, the spectrum shows a
blue continuum with narrow emission lines of H and Fe II. During the second
peak, the spectrum becomes cooler, resembling that of a K-type star, and the
emission lines are replaced by a forest of narrow lines in absorption. About 5
months later, while the optical light curves are characterized by a fast linear
decline, the NIR ones show a moderate rebrightening, observed until the
transient disappeared in solar conjunction. At these late epochs, the spectrum
becomes reminiscent of that of M-type stars, with prominent molecular
absorption bands. The late-time properties suggest the formation of some dust
in the expanding common envelope or an IR echo from foreground pre-existing
dust. We propose that the object is a common-envelope transient, possibly the
outcome of a merging event in a massive binary, similar to NGC4490-2011OT1.

attenuated, resembling a plateau. The progenitors of three of them
(NGC4490-2011OT1, M101-2015OT1, and SNhunt248), likely relatively massive blue
to yellow stars, were also observed in a pre-eruptive stage when their
luminosity was slowly increasing. Early spectra obtained during the first peak
show a blue continuum with superposed prominent narrow Balmer lines, with P
Cygni profiles. Lines of Fe II are also clearly observed, mostly in emission.
During the second peak, the spectral continuum becomes much redder, Halpha is
barely detected, and a forest of narrow metal lines is observed in absorption.
Very late-time spectra (~6 months after blue peak) show an extremely red
spectral continuum, peaking in the infrared (IR) domain. Halpha is detected in
pure emission at such late phases, along with broad absorption bands due to
molecular overtones (such as TiO, VO). We discuss a few alternative scenarios
for LRNe. Although major instabilities of single massive stars cannot be
definitely ruled out, we favour a common envelope ejection in a close binary
system, with possibly a final coalescence of the two stars. The similarity
between LRNe and the outburst observed a few months before the explosion of the

static code analysis is challenging. The different languages used in developing
today's systems often have different lexical, syntactical, and semantic rules
that make thorough analysis difficult. Also, they offer different
modularization and dependency mechanisms, both within and between components.
Finally, they promote and--or require varieties of frameworks offering
different sets of services, which introduce hidden dependencies, invisible with
current static code analysis approaches. In this paper, we identify five
important challenges that static code analysis must overcome with multilanguage
systems and we propose requirements to handle them. Then, we present solutions
of these requirements to handle JEE applications, which combine server-side
Java source code with a number of client-side Web dialects (e.g., JSP, JSF)
while relying on frameworks (e.g., Web and EJB containers) that create hidden
dependencies. Finally, we evaluate our implementations of the solutions by
developing a set of tools to analyze JEE applications to build a dependency
call graph and by applying these tools on two sample JEE applications. Our
evaluation shows that our tools can solve the identified challenges and improve
the recall in the identification of multilanguage dependencies compared to
standard JEE static code analysis and, thus, indirectly that the proposed
requirements are useful to build multilanguage static code analysis.

wider exposure range than generally possible in individual studies, evaluation
of population subgroups and disease subtypes with more statistical power, and
more precise estimation of biomarker-disease associations. However, biomarker
measurements often require calibration to a reference assay prior to pooling
due to assay and laboratory variability across studies. We propose several
methods for calibrating and combining biomarker data from nested case-control
studies when reference assay data are obtained from a subset of controls in
each contributing study. Specifically, we describe a two-stage method and two
aggregated methods, named the internalized and full calibration methods, to
evaluate the main effect of the biomarker exposure on disease risk and whether
that association is modified by a potential covariate. The internalized method
uses the reference laboratory measurement in the analysis when available and
otherwise uses the calibrated measurement. The full calibration method uses
calibrated biomarker measurements for all subjects, even those with reference
laboratory measurements. Our results demonstrate that the full calibration
method is the preferred aggregated approach to minimize bias in point estimates
regardless of the inclusion of an interaction term in the model. We also
observe that the two-stage and full calibration methods provide similar effect
and variance estimates, but that the variance estimates for these two methods
are slightly larger than those from the internalized approach. As an
illustrative example, we apply the methods in a pooling project of nested
case-control studies to evaluate (i) the association between circulating
vitamin D levels and risk of stroke, and (ii) how BMI modifies the association
between circulating vitamin D levels and cardiovascular disease.

detector built to date for the measurement of direct interactions of weakly
interacting massive particles with normal matter. The data acquisition system
(DAQ) is constructed from commercial, open source, and custom components to
digitize signals from the detector and store them for later analysis. The
system achieves an extremely low signal threshold below a tenth of a
photoelectron using a parallelized readout with the global trigger deferred to
a later, software stage. The event identification is based on MongoDB database
queries and has over 97% efficiency at recognizing interactions at the analysis
energy threshold. A readout bandwidth over 300 MB/s is reached in calibration
modes and is further expandable via parallelization. This DAQ system was
successfully used during three years of operation of XENON1T.

They offer the possibility to determine class belongings for unseen examples
using just a handful of examples for each class. Such models are trained on a
wide range of classes and their respective examples, learning a decision metric
in the process. Types of few-shot models include matching networks and
prototypical networks. We show a new way of training prototypical few-shot
models for just a single class. These models have the ability to predict the
likelihood of an unseen query belonging to a group of examples without any
given counterexamples. The difficulty here lies in the fact that no relative
distance to other classes can be calculated via softmax. We solve this problem
by introducing a ""null class"" centered around zero, and enforcing centering
with batch normalization. Trained on the commonly used Omniglot data set, we
obtain a classification accuracy of .98 on the matched test set, and of .8 on
unmatched MNIST data. On the more complex MiniImageNet data set, test accuracy
is .8. In addition, we propose a novel Gaussian layer for distance calculation
in a prototypical network, which takes the support examples' distribution
rather than just their centroid into account. This extension shows promising
results when a higher number of support examples is available.

fail in describing anions, due to large self-interaction errors. The problem
may be circumvented by using localized basis sets of reduced size, leaving no
variational flexibility for the extra electron to delocalize. Alternatively, a
recent approach exploiting DFT evaluations of total energies on electronic
densities optimized at the Hartree-Fock (HF) level has been reported, showing
that the self-interaction-free HF densities are able to lead to an improved
description of the additional electron, returning affinities in close agreement
with the experiments. Nonetheless, such an approach can fail when the HF
densities are too inaccurate. Here, an alternative approach is presented, in
which an embedding environment is used to stabilize the anion in a bound
configuration. Similarly to the HF case, when computing total energies at the
DFT level on these corrected densities, electron affinities in very good
agreement with experiments can be recovered. The effect of the environment can
be evaluated and removed by an extrapolation of the results to the limit of
vanishing embedding. Moreover, the approach can be easily applied to DFT
calculations with delocalized basis sets, e.g. plane-waves, for which
alternative approaches are either not viable or more computationally demanding.
The proposed extrapolation strategy can be thus applied also to extended
systems, as often studied in condensed-matter physics and materials science,
and we illustrate how the embedding environment can be exploited to determine
the energy of an adsorbing anion - here a chloride ion on a metal surface -
whose charge configuration would be incorrectly predicted by standard density
functionals.

heterostructure, made of single layer molybdenum disulphide and thin boron
nitride films, electrons and holes created in boron nitride can be transferred
to the dichalcogenide where they form electron-hole pairs yielding
luminescence. This cathodoluminescence can be mapped with a spatial resolution
far exceeding what can be achieved in a typical photoluminescence experiment,
and is highly valuable to understand the optoelectronic properties at the
nanometer scale. We find that in heterostructures prepared following the
mainstream dry transfer technique, cathodoluminescence is locally extinguished,
and we show that this extinction is associated with the formation of defects,
that are detected in Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence. We establish
that to avoid defect formation induced by low-energy electron beams and to
ensure efficient transfer of electrons and holes at the interface between the
layers, flat and uniform interlayer interfaces are needed, that are free of
trapped species, airborne ones or contaminants associated with sample
preparation. We show that heterostructure fabrication using a pick-up technique

times the nuclear saturation density) is both intriguing and unclear and could
have important observable effects in the present gravitational wave era of
neutron stars. As the matter density increases in compact stars, the sound
velocity is expected to approach the conformal limit ($c_s/c=1/\sqrt{3}$) at
high densities and should also fulfill the causality limit ($c_s/c<1$).
However, its detailed behavior remains a hot topic of debate. It was suggested
that the sound velocity of dense matter could be an important indicator for a
deconfinement phase transition, where a particular shape might be expected for
its density dependence. In this work, we explore the general properties of the
sound velocity and the adiabatic index of dense matter in hybrid stars, as well
as in neutron stars and quark stars. Various conditions are employed for
hadron-quark phase transition with varying interface tension. We find that the
expected behavior of the sound velocity can also be achieved by the
nonperturbative properties of the quark phase, in addition to a deconfinement
phase transition. And it leads to a more compact star with a similar mass. We
then propose a new class of quark star equation of states, which could be
tested by future high-precision radius measurements of pulsar-like objects.

power, amounts of labeled data and human expertise. Thus, ML models constitute
intellectual property (IP) and business value for their owners. Embedding
digital watermarks during model training allows a model owner to later identify
their models in case of theft or misuse. However, model functionality can also
be stolen via model extraction, where an adversary trains a surrogate model
using results returned from a prediction API of the original model. Recent work
has shown that model extraction is a realistic threat. Existing watermarking
schemes are ineffective against IP theft via model extraction since it is the
adversary who trains the surrogate model. In this paper, we introduce DAWN
(Dynamic Adversarial Watermarking of Neural Networks), the first approach to
use watermarking to deter model extraction IP theft. Unlike prior watermarking
schemes, DAWN does not impose changes to the training process but it operates
at the prediction API of the protected model, by dynamically changing the
responses for a small subset of queries (e.g., <0.5%) from API clients. This
set is a watermark that will be embedded in case a client uses its queries to
train a surrogate model. We show that DAWN is resilient against two
state-of-the-art model extraction attacks, effectively watermarking all
extracted surrogate models, allowing model owners to reliably demonstrate
ownership (with confidence $>1- 2^{-64}$), incurring negligible loss of
prediction accuracy (0.03-0.5%).

minute forces and, potentially, the foundations of quantum physics by making
use of interference between spatially separated matter waves. Furthering this
development requires ever-increasing stability of the interferometer, typically
achieved by improving its physical isolation from the environment. Here we
introduce as an alternative strategy the concept of dynamical decoupling
applied to spatial degrees of freedom of massive objects. We show that the
superposed matter waves can be driven along paths in space that render their
superposition resilient to many important sources of noise. As a concrete
implementation, we present the case of matter-wave interferometers in a
magnetic field gradient based on either levitated or free-falling nanodiamonds
hosting a color center. We present an in-depth analysis of potential sources of
decoherence in such a setup and of the ability of our protocol to suppress
them. These effects include gravitational forces, interactions of the net
magnetic and dipole moments of the diamond with magnetic and electric fields,
surface dangling bonds, rotational degrees of freedom, Casimir-Polder forces,
and diamagnetic forces. Contrary to previous analyses, diamagnetic forces are
not negligible in this type of interferometers and, if not acted upon lead to
small separation distances that scale with the inverse of the magnetic field
gradient. We show that our motional dynamical decoupling strategy renders the
system immune to such limitations while continuing to protect its coherence
from environmental influences, achieving a linear-in-time growth of the
separation distance independent of the magnetic field gradient. Hence, motional
dynamical decoupling may become an essential tool in driving the sensitivity of
matter-wave interferometry to the next level.

cannot take into account an innate hierarchy among target classes (e.g., cats
and dogs in animal image classification) or additional information that can be
easily derived from the data (e.g.,numbers larger than five in the recognition
of handwritten digits), thereby resulting in scalability issues when the number
of target classes is large. Combining two related but slightly different ideas
of hierarchical classification and logical learning by auxiliary inputs, we
propose a new learning framework called hierarchical auxiliary learning, which
not only address the scalability issues with a large number of classes but also
could further reduce the classification/recognition errors with a reasonable
number of classes. In the hierarchical auxiliary learning, target classes are
semantically or non-semantically grouped into superclasses, which turns the
original problem of mapping between an image and its target class into a new
problem of mapping between a pair of an image and its superclass and the target
class. To take the advantage of superclasses, we introduce an auxiliary block
into a neural network, which generates auxiliary scores used as additional
information for final classification/recognition; in this paper, we add the
auxiliary block between the last residual block and the fully-connected output
layer of the ResNet. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
hierarchical auxiliary learning can reduce classification errors up to 0.56,
1.6 and 3.56 percent with MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively.

combines deep learning with reasoning for solving complex tasks, typically in

stochastic-gradient-based neural network optimization. We illustrate the power
of DRNets on de-mixing overlapping hand-written Sudokus (Multi-MNIST-Sudoku)

inferring crystal structures of materials from X-ray diffraction data under
thermodynamic rules (Crystal-Structure-Phase-Mapping). At a high level, DRNets
encode a structured latent space of the input data, which is constrained to
adhere to prior knowledge by a reasoning module. The structured latent encoding
is used by a generative decoder to generate the targeted output. Finally, an
overall objective combines responses from the generative decoder (thinking
fast) and the reasoning module (thinking slow), which is optimized using
constraint-aware stochastic gradient descent. We show how to encode different
tasks as DRNets and demonstrate DRNets' effectiveness with detailed
experiments: DRNets significantly outperform the state of the art and experts'
capabilities on Crystal-Structure-Phase-Mapping, recovering more precise and
physically meaningful crystal structures. On Multi-MNIST-Sudoku, DRNets
perfectly recovered the mixed Sudokus' digits, with 100% digit accuracy,
outperforming the supervised state-of-the-art MNIST de-mixing models. Finally,

which two processes shape opinion dynamics at interwoven time-scales: (i)
agents adapt their opinions subject to influence from social network neighbours
who hold opinions within a tolerance interval $\delta$ and (ii) agents rewire
network connections with an aim to maximize their own influence on overall
system opinion. We study this system in both an endogenous setting in which all
agents are subject to influence and also attempt to maximize influence, and in
a setting of exogenous control, in which external agents not subject to
influence adaptively attempt to maximize their influence. In both settings we
find three regimes of stationary opinion configurations: (i) for low $\delta$ a
regime of two evenly balanced radicalized opinion clusters at the extremes of
the opinion space, (ii) for intermediate $\delta$ a 'winner-takes-most' regime
of two unevenly sized radicalized opinion clusters, and (iii) for large
$\delta$ a regime in which very low spread compromise consensus states can be
reached. Comparing to adaptive processes of random and deliberately
spread-reducing rewiring, we demonstrate that in regime (iii) competitive
influence maximization can achieve near-minimal opinion spread within
near-optimal times. Further, we also show that competitive influence maximizing
rewiring can reduce the impact of small influential minorities on consensus

In this work, we propose a progressive learning approach for image-pivoted

progress to learn the sentence-level translation by utilizing the learned word

standard usage of the term ""shadow"" describes the appearance of a black hole
illuminated from all directions, including from behind the observer. A backlit
black hole casts a somewhat larger shadow. Neither shadow heuristic is
particularly relevant to understanding the appearance of emission originating
near the black hole, where the emission profile and gravitational redshift play
the dominant roles in determining the observed size of the central dark area. A
photon ring results from light rays that orbit near the black hole before
escaping to infinity, where they arrive near a ring-shaped ""critical curve"" on
the image plane. Although the brightness can become arbitrarily large near this
critical curve in the case of optically thin emitting matter, we show that the
enhancement is only logarithmic, and hence is of no relevance to present
observations. For optically thin emission from a geometrically thin or thick
disk, photons that make only a fraction of an orbit will generically give rise
to a much wider ""lensing ring,"" which is a demagnified image of the back of the
disk, superimposed on top of the direct emission. The lensing ring is centered
at a radius ~5% larger than the photon ring and its width is ~0.5-1M. It can be
relatively brighter by a factor of 2-3 and thus could provide a significant
feature in high resolution images. Nevertheless, the characteristic features of

establish their origin. However, the velocity and molecular composition of
primary minerals, hydrated silicates, and organic materials can be determined
by in situ dust detector instruments. Such instruments could sample the cloud
of micrometer-scale particles shed by asteroids to provide direct links to
known meteorite groups without returning the samples to terrestrial
laboratories. We extend models of the measured lunar dust cloud from LADEE to
show that the abundance of detectable impact-generated microsamples around
asteroids is a function of the parent body radius, heliocentric distance, flyby
distance, and speed. We use monte carlo modeling to show that several tens to
hundreds of particles, if randomly ejected and detected during a flyby, would
be a sufficient number to classify the parent body as an ordinary chondrite,
basaltic achondrite, or other class of meteorite. Encountering and measuring
microsamples shed from near-earth and main-belt asteroids, coupled with
complementary imaging and multispectral measurements, could accomplish a
thorough characterization of small, airless bodies.

which is typically a diffusion process if it is a continuous distribution. For
an arbitrary diffusion it can a difficult task to evaluate the semi-group and
its derivatives. In this paper, for polynomial test functions, instead of
calculating the semi-group of a diffusion, via a duality argument, we instead

in the generation of the secondary flow in a turbulent square duct. The
coherent structures are defined as connected regions of flow where the product
of the instantaneous fluctuations of two velocity components is higher than a
threshold based on the long-time turbulence statistics, in the spirit of the
three-dimensional quadrant analysis proposed by Lozano-Dur\'an et al. (J. Fluid
Mech., vol. 694, 2012, pp. 100-130). We consider both the direct contribution
of the structures to the mean in-plane velocity components and their
geometrical properties. The instantaneous phenomena taking place in the
turbulent duct are compared with turbulent channel flow at Reynolds numbers of
$Re_\tau=180$ and $360$, based on friction velocity at the center-plane and
channel half height. In the core region of the duct, the fractional
contribution of intense events to the wall-normal component of the mean
velocity is in very good agreement with that in the channel, despite the
presence of the secondary flow in the former. Additionally, the shapes of the
three-dimensional objects do not differ significantly in both flows. On the
other hand, in the corner region of the duct, the proximity of the walls
affects both the geometrical properties of the coherent structures and the
contribution to the mean component of the vertical velocity, which is less
relevant than that of the complementary portion of the flow not included in
such objects. Our results show however that strong Reynolds shear-stress
events, despite the differences observed between channel and duct, do not
contribute directly to the secondary motion, and thus other phenomena need to
be considered instead.

spacecraft cannot handle transmitting individual images for such a huge stellar
sample at the right cadence, so the development of an appropriate strategy to
perform on-board data reduction is mandatory. We employ aperture photometry to
produce stellar light curves in flight. Our aim is thus to find the mask model
that optimizes the scientific performance of the reduced data. We considered
three distinct aperture models: binary mask, weighted Gaussian mask, and
weighted gradient mask giving lowest noise-to-signal ratio, computed through a
novel direct method. An innovative criterion was adopted for choosing between
different mask models. We designated as optimal the model providing the best
compromise between sensitivity to detect true and false planet transits. We
determined the optimal model based on simulated noise-to-signal ratio and
frequency of threshold crossing events. Our results show that, although the
binary mask statistically presents a few percent higher noise-to-signal ratio
compared to weighted masks, both strategies have very similar efficiency in
detecting legitimate planet transits. When it comes to avoiding spurious
signals from contaminant stars however the binary mask statistically collects
considerably less contaminant flux than weighted masks, thereby allowing the
former to deliver up to $\sim$30\% less false transit signatures at
$7.1\sigma$. Our proposed approach for choosing apertures has been proven to be
decisive for the determination of a mask model capable to provide near maximum

Measurements of the protein dynamical transition using terahertz time-domain

bleached state. The result is surprising given that there is little change in
the protein surface, and thus the solvent dynamics held responsible for the
transition should not change. A spectral analysis of the measurements guided by
quasiharmonic calculations of the protein absorbance reveals that indeed the
solvent dynamical turn-on temperature is independent of the thermal stability
and photostate however the protein dynamical turn-on temperature shifts to
higher temperatures. This is the first demonstration of switching the protein
dynamical turn-on temperature with protein functional state. The observed shift
in protein dynamical turn-on temperature relative to the solvent indicates an
increase in the required mobile waters necessary for the protein picosecond

reveal that the photobleached state is more thermally stable and structural
analysis of related RFPs shows that there is an increase in internal water
channels as well as a more uniform atomic root mean squared displacement. These
observations are consistent with previous suggestions that water channels form
with extended light excitation providing O2 access to the chromophore and
subsequent fluorescence loss. We report that these same channels increase
internal coupling enhancing thermal stability and collectivity of the

  Posts on Twitter","8 pages, submitted in ASONAM Multidisciplinary Track, 2019",,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In October 2017, there happened the uprising of an unprecedented online
movement on social media by women across the world who started publicly sharing
their untold stories of being sexually harassed along with the hashtag #MeToo
(or some variants of it). Those stories did not only strike the silence that
had long hid the perpetrators, but also allowed women to discharge some of
their bottled-up grievances, and revealed many important information
surrounding sexual harassment. In this paper, we present our analysis of about
one million such tweets collected between October 15 and October 31, 2017 that
reveals some interesting patterns and attributes of the people, place,
emotions, actions, and reactions related to the tweeted stories. Based on our
analysis, we also advance the discussion on the potential role of online social
media in breaking the silence of women by factoring in the strengths and
limitations of these platforms.

radio astronomical observations at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.
The rotational spectrum of CH$_3$$^{34}$SH, which is complicated by the
large-amplitude internal rotation of the CH$_3$ group versus the $^{34}$SH
frame, was investigated in the 49$-$510 GHz and 1.1$-$1.5 THz frequency ranges
in natural isotopic abundance. The analysis of the spectrum was performed up to
the second excited torsional state, and the obtained data were modeled with the
RAM36 program. A fit within experimental accuracy was obtained with a RAM
Hamiltonian model that uses 72 parameters. Predictions based on this fit are
used to search for CH$_3$$^{34}$SH with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) toward the hot molecular core Sgr B2(N2),
but blends with emission lines of other species prevent its firm identification

Greek island bearing the same name. These are mysterious objects attached to
non-real Weyl groups. In algebraic topology, a $p$-compact group $\mathbf{X}$
is a space which is a homotopy-theoretic $p$-local analogue of a compact Lie
group. A connected $p$-compact group $\mathbf{X}$ is determined by its root
datum which in turn determines its Weyl group $W_\mathbf{X}$. In this article
we give strong numerical evidence for a connection between these two objects by
considering the case when $\mathbf{X}$ is the exotic $2$-compact group DI$(4)$
constructed by Dwyer--Wilkerson and $W_\mathbf{X}$ is the complex reflection
group $G_{24} \cong$ GL$_3(2) \times C_2$. Inspired by results in
Deligne--Lusztig theory for classical groups, if $q$ is an odd prime power we
propose a set Irr$(\mathbf{X}(q))$ of `ordinary irreducible characters'
associated to the space $\mathbf{X}(q)$ of homotopy fixed points under the
unstable Adams operation $\psi^q$. Notably Irr$(\mathbf{X}(q))$ includes the
set of unipotent characters associated to $G_{24}$ constructed by Brou\'{e},
Malle and Michel from the Hecke algebra of $G_{24}$ using the theory of
spetses. By regarding $\mathbf{X}(q)$ as the classifying space of a
Benson--Solomon fusion system Sol$(q)$ we formulate and prove an analogue of
Robinson's ordinary weight conjecture that the number of characters of defect
$d$ in Irr$(\mathbf{X}(q))$ can be counted locally.

at four optical wavelength bands and found large fluctuations that are
significantly brighter than those expected for ordinary galaxies. Good
cross-correlations with flat spectra are found down to 0.2 arcsec, indicating
the existence of a spatial structure even at the 0.2 arcsec scale. The detected
auto and cross-correlations provide a lower limit of 24 nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$
for the absolute sky brightness at 700-900 nm, which is consistent with
previous observations. We searched for candidate objects to explain the
detected large fluctuation using the catalog of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field
(UDF), and found that the surface number density of faint compact objects
(FCOs) rapidly increases toward the faint end. Radial profiles of FCOs are
indistinguishable from the PSF, and the effective radius based on de
Vaucouleur's law is estimated to be smaller than 0.02 arcsec. The SEDs of FCOs
follow a power law at optical wavelengths, but show greater emission and
structure at $\lambda$ > 1 $\mu$m. Assuming that the FCOs are the cause of the
excess brightness and fluctuations, the faint magnitude limit is 34.9 mag for
the F775W band, and the surface number density reaches $2.6 \times 10^3$
(arcsec)$^{-2}$. Recent gamma-ray observations require that the redshift of
FCOs must be less than 0.1, if FCOs are the origin of the excess optical and
infrared background. Assuming that FCOs consist of missing baryons, the mass
and luminosity of a single FCO range from $10^{2}$ to 1$0^{3}$ solar units, and
mass-to-luminosity ratio is significantly lower than 1.0 solar unit. The
maximum effective radius of an FCO is 4.7 pc. These results and the good
correlation between near-infrared and X-ray background indicate that FCOs could
be powered by the gravitational energy associated with black holes.

surplus at drawdown (may not be deficit in this case), which generalizes the
known results on the classical expected discounted penalty function in Gerber

$q$-scale functions and the L\'{e}vy measure associated with the L\'{e}vy

with natural language is addressed. Unlike previous video captioning work
mainly exploiting the cues of video contents to make a language description, we
propose a reconstruction network (RecNet) in a novel
encoder-decoder-reconstructor architecture, which leverages both forward (video
to sentence) and backward (sentence to video) flows for video captioning.
Specifically, the encoder-decoder component makes use of the forward flow to
produce a sentence description based on the encoded video semantic features.
Two types of reconstructors are subsequently proposed to employ the backward
flow and reproduce the video features from local and global perspectives,
respectively, capitalizing on the hidden state sequence generated by the
decoder. Moreover, in order to make a comprehensive reconstruction of the video
features, we propose to fuse the two types of reconstructors together. The
generation loss yielded by the encoder-decoder component and the reconstruction
loss introduced by the reconstructor are jointly cast into training the
proposed RecNet in an end-to-end fashion. Furthermore, the RecNet is fine-tuned
by CIDEr optimization via reinforcement learning, which significantly boosts
the captioning performance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed reconstructor can boost the performance of video
captioning consistently.

specific, ASV technology is used to perform a similarity search between the
voices of recruited attackers (6) and potential target speakers (7,365) from
VoxCeleb corpora to find the closest targets for each of the attackers. In
addition, we consider 'median', 'furthest', and 'common' targets to serve as a
reference points. Our goal is to gain insights how well similarity rankings
transfer from the attacker's ASV system to the attacked ASV system, whether the
attackers are able to improve their attacks by mimicking, and how the
properties of the voices of attackers change due to mimicking. We address these
questions through ASV experiments, listening tests, and prosodic and formant
analyses. For the ASV experiments, we use i-vector technology in the attacker
side, and x-vectors in the attacked side. For the listening tests, we recruit
listeners through crowdsourcing. The results of the ASV experiments indicate
that the speaker similarity scores transfer well from one ASV system to
another. Both the ASV experiments and the listening tests reveal that the
mimicry attempts do not, in general, help in bringing attacker's scores closer
to the target's. A detailed analysis shows that mimicking does not improve
attacks, when the natural voices of attackers and targets are similar to each
other. The analysis of prosody and formants suggests that the attackers were
able to considerably change their speaking rates when mimicking, but the
changes in F0 and formants were modest. Overall, the results suggest that
untrained impersonators do not pose a high threat towards ASV systems, but the
use of ASV systems to attack other ASV systems is a potential threat.

clearly identifiable outliers (e.g. an impulsive component), it can be
efficiently mitigated in real time by intermittently nonlinear filters
developed in our earlier work, achieving improvements in the signal quality
otherwise unattainable. However, apparent amplitude outliers in the
interference can disappear and reappear due to various filtering effects,
including fading and multipass, as the signal propagates through media and/or
the signal processing chain. In addition, the outlier structure of the
interference can be obscured by strong non-outlier interfering signals, such as
thermal noise and/or adjacent channel interference, or by the signal of
interest itself. In this paper, we first outline the overall approach to using
intermittently nonlinear filters for in-band, real-time mitigation of such
interference with hidden outlier components in practical complex interference
scenarios. We then introduce Complementary Intermittently Nonlinear Filters
(CINFs) and focus on the particular task of mitigating the outlier noise
obscured by the signal of interest itself. We describe practical
implementations of such nonlinear filtering arrangements for mitigation of
hidden outlier interference, in the process of analog-to-digital conversion,
for wide ranges of interference powers and the rates of outlier generating
events. To emphasize the effectiveness and versatility of this approach, in our
examples we use particularly challenging waveforms that severely obscure
low-amplitude outlier noise, such as broadband chirp signals (e.g. used in
radar, sonar, and spread-spectrum communications) and ``bursty,"" high crest

test the theory we performed experiments using two different suction cups, made
from soft polyvinylchloride (PVC), in contact with sandblasted
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) plates. We found that the measured time to
detatch (lifetime) of suction cups were in good agreement with theory, except
for surfaces with the root-mean-square (rms) roughness below $\approx 1 \ {\rm

blockage of critical constrictions. Suction cup volume, stiffness and elastic
modulus have a huge influence on the air leakage and hence the failure time of
the cups. Based on our research we propose an improved biomimetic design of
suction cups, that could show improved failure times in varying degree of

Galerkin (DG) methods for the simulation of natural convection problems.
Assuming small temperature fluctuations, the Boussinesq approximation is valid
and the flow can simply be modeled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations coupled with a transport equation for the temperature and a buoyancy
source term in the momentum equation. Our numerical scheme is developed
starting from the work presented in [TD14], in which the spatial domain is
discretized using a face-based staggered unstructured mesh. For the computation
of the advection and diffusion terms, two different algorithms are presented:
i) a purely Eulerian explicit upwind-type scheme and ii) a semi-Lagrangian
approach. The first methodology leads to a conservative scheme whose major
drawback is the time step restriction imposed by the CFL stability condition.
On the contrary, computational efficiency can be notably improved relying on a
semi-Lagrangian approach. This method leads to an unconditionally stable scheme
if the diffusive terms are discretized implicitly. Once the advection and
diffusion contributions have been computed, the pressure Poisson equation is
solved and the velocity is updated. As a second model for the computation of
buoyancy-driven flows, we also consider the full compressible Navier-Stokes
equations. The staggered semi-implicit DG method first proposed in [TD17] for
all Mach number flows is properly extended to account for the gravity source
terms arising in the momentum and energy conservation laws. The validity and
the robustness of our novel class of staggered semi-implicit DG schemes is
assessed at the aid of several classical benchmark problems, showing in all
cases a good agreement with available numerical reference data. Finally, a
detailed comparison between the incompressible and the compressible solver is
presented.

We use the framework of generalised linear models (GLMs) to illustrate that
predictive and causal queries require distinct processes for their application
and subsequent interpretation of results. In particular, we identify five
primary ways in which GLMs for prediction differ from GLMs for causal
inference: (1) The covariates that should be considered for inclusion in (and
possibly exclusion from) the model; (2) How a suitable set of covariates to
include in the model is determined; (3) Which covariates are ultimately
selected, and what functional form (i.e. parameterisation) they take; (4) How
the model is evaluated; and (5) How the model is interpreted. We outline some
of the potential consequences of failing to acknowledge and respect these
differences, and additionally consider the implications for machine learning
(ML) methods. We then conclude with three recommendations which we hope will
help ensure that both prediction and causal modelling are used appropriately
and to greatest effect in health research.

subject of intense investigation over the last thirty years, but without a
clear agreement about its origin. Owing to a recent observation in Raman
spectroscopy, of a precursor in the charge channel, on top of the well known
fact of a precursor in the superconducting channel, we present here a novel
idea: the PG is formed through a Higgs mechanism, where two kinds of preformed
pairs, in the particle-particle and particle-hole channels, become entangled
through a freezing of their global phase. Remarkably, this entanglement is
equivalent to fractionalizing a Cooper pair density wave (PDW) into its
elementary parts; the particle-hole pair, giving rise to both density
modulations and current modulations, and the particle-particle counterpart,
leading to the formation of Cooper pairs. From this perspective, the
""fractionalized PDW"" becomes the central object around the formation of the
pseudo-gap. The ""locking"" of phases between the charge and superconducting
modes gives a unique explanation for the unusual global phase coherence of
short-range charge modulations, observed below $T_{c}$ on phase sensitive
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). A simple microscopic model enables us to
estimate the mean-field values of the precursor gaps in each channel and the PG
energy scale, and to compare them to the values observed in Raman scattering
spectroscopy. We also discuss the possibility of a multiplicity of orders in
the PG phase and give an overview of the phase diagram.

the size of the ambiguity set, which is often lack of business meaning, through
the chance parameters constraining the objective function. We first show that,
for general $\phi$-divergences, a DRO problem is asymptotically equivalent to a
class of mean-deviation problems. These mean-deviation problems are not subject
to uncertain distributions, and the ambiguity radius in the original DRO
problem now plays the role of controlling the risk preference of the
decision-maker. We then demonstrate that a DRO problem can be cast as a
chance-constrained optimization (CCO) problem when a boundedness constraint is
added to the decision variables. Without the boundedness constraint, the CCO
problem is shown to perform uniformly better than the DRO problem, irrespective
of the radius of the ambiguity set, the choice of the divergence measure, or
the tail heaviness of the center distribution. Thanks to our high-order
expansion result, a notable feature of our analysis is that it applies to
divergence measures that accommodate well heavy tail distributions such as the
student $t$-distribution and the lognormal distribution, besides the
widely-used Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which requires the distribution
of the objective function to be exponentially bounded. Using the portfolio

statistical methods for analysing high-dimensional data and complex non-linear

the use of static graphical structures for extracting the most significant
dependence interrelationships between the variables of interest. Recently,
Bayesian nonparametric techniques have become popular for modelling complex
phenomena in a flexible and efficient manner, but only few attempts have been
made in econometrics. In this paper, we provide an innovative Bayesian
nonparametric (BNP) time-varying graphical framework for making inference in
high-dimensional time series. We include a Bayesian nonparametric dependent
prior specification on the matrix of coefficients and the covariance matrix by
mean of a Time-Series DPP as in Nieto-Barajas et al. (2012). Following Billio
et al. (2019), our hierarchical prior overcomes over-parametrization and
over-fitting issues by clustering the vector autoregressive (VAR) coefficients
into groups and by shrinking the coefficients of each group toward a common
location. Our BNP timevarying VAR model is based on a spike-and-slab
construction coupled with dependent Dirichlet Process prior (DPP) and allows
to: (i) infer time-varying Granger causality networks from time series; (ii)
flexibly model and cluster non-zero time-varying coefficients; (iii)
accommodate for potential non-linearities. In order to assess the performance
of the model, we study the merits of our approach by considering a well-known
macroeconomic dataset. Moreover, we check the robustness of the method by
comparing two alternative specifications, with Dirac and diffuse spike prior

embedded sensing devices, offer the opportunity of fine grained online
spatio-temporal collection, communication and analysis of physical parameters.
Various applications have been proposed and validated so far for environmental
monitoring, security and industrial control systems. One particular application
domain has been shown suitable for the requirements of precision agriculture
where such systems can improve yields, increase efficiency and reduce input
usage. We present a data analysis and processing approach for distributed
monitoring of crops and soil where hierarchical aggregation and modelling
primitives contribute to the robustness of the network by alleviating
communication bottlenecks and reducing the energy required for redundant data
transmissions. The focus is on leveraging the fog computing paradigm to exploit
local node computing resources and generate events towards upper decision
systems. Key metrics are reported which highlight the improvements achieved. A
case study is carried out on real field data for crop and soil monitoring with
outlook on operational and implementation constraints.

mixtures that exhibit faceted and dendritic microstructures were performed. The
strength of compositional convection was correlated with the solidifying
microstructure morphology, with the help of separate Rayleigh numbers in the
mushy and bulk-fluid zones. While the dendritic solidification experienced a
monotonic decrease in the bulk fluid temperature, solidification of the faceted
case revealed an unconventional, anomalous temperature rise in the bulk liquid,
at the initiation of the eutectic phase. Based on the bulk-liquid temperature
profile, three distinct regimes of heat transfer were observed in the liquid
over the course of solidification, namely - convection-dominated, transition,
and conduction-dominated. The observations were analyzed and verified with the
help of different initial compositions, as well as other mixtures that form
faceted morphology upon freezing. The observed temperature rise was further
ascertained by performing an energy balance in an indicative control volume
ahead of the solid-liquid interface. The plausible mechanism behind the gain in
temperature of the liquid during freezing was further generalized with the help
of a simplified one-dimensional numerical model, and was extended to metals
which are low Prandtl number mixtures. The study sheds new insights into the
role of microstrostructural morphology in governing the transport phenomena in
the bulk liquid.

properties of the Proportionally fair, TCP fair, and the Delay-based dual
algorithms in the presence of two distinct time delays. In particular, our
focus is on the interplay between different notions of fairness, stability, and
bifurcation theoretic properties. Different notions of fairness give rise to
different non-linear models for the class of Dual algorithms. One can devise
conditions for local stability, for each of these models, but such conditions
do not offer clear design recommendations on which fairness criteria is
desirable. With a bifurcation-theoretic analysis, we have to take non-linear
terms into consideration, which helps to learn additional dynamical properties
of the various systems. In the case of TCP fair and Delay dual algorithms, with
two delays, we present evidence that they can undergo a sub-critical Hopf
bifurcation, which has not been previously revealed through analysis of the
single delay variants of these algorithms. A sub-critical Hopf bifurcation can
result in either large amplitude limit cycles or unstable limit cycles, and
hence should be avoided in engineering applications. In the case of the
Proportionally fair algorithm, we provide strong evidence to suggest that all
one should expect is the occurrence of a super-critical Hopf bifurcation, which
leads to stable limit cycles with small amplitude. Thus, from a design
perspective, our analysis favors the use of Proportional fairness in the class
of dual congestion control algorithms. To best of our knowledge, this is the
first study that presents evidence to suggest that fluid models representing
Internet congestion control algorithms may undergo a sub-critical Hopf
bifurcation.

of age, period, and cohort, but disaggregation of the three dimensions is
difficult because cohort = period - age. We argue that this technical
difficulty reflects a disconnection between how cohort effect is conceptualized
and how it is modeled in the traditional age-period-cohort framework. We
propose a new method, called the age-period-cohort-interaction (APC-I) model,
that is qualitatively different from previous methods in that it represents
Ryder's (1965) theoretical account about the conditions under which cohort
differentiation may arise. This APC-I model does not require problematic
statistical assumptions and the interpretation is straightforward. It
quantifies inter-cohort deviations from the age and period main effects and
also permits hypothesis testing about intra-cohort life-course dynamics. We
demonstrate how this new model can be used to examine age, period, and cohort
patterns in women's labor force participation.

software engineering. It has many dimensions which differ from users' point of
view that depend on their requirements. Therefore, those dimensions lead to
difficulty in measuring and defining the software quality properly. Software
quality measurement is the main core of the software quality. Thus, it is
necessary to study and develop the software measurements to meet the better
quality. The use of libraries increases software quality more than that of
using generic programming because these libraries are prepared and tested in
advance. In addition, these libraries reduce the effort that is spent in
designing, testing, and maintenance processes. In this research, we presented a
new model to calculate the saved effort that results from using libraries
instead of generic programming in the coding, testing, and productivity
processes. The proposed model consists of three metrics that are Library
Investment Ratio, Library Investment Level, and Program Simplicity. An
empirical analyzes has been applied into ten projects to compare the results of
the model with Reuse Percent. The results show that the model has better
indication of the improvement of software quality and productivity rather than
Reuse Percent.

  Inspections",,,,,"cs.SI math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite the wide range of possible scenarios in the aftermath of a disruptive
event, each community can make choices to improve its resilience, or its
ability to bounce back. A resilient community is one that has prepared for, and
can thus absorb, recover from, and adapt to the disruptive event. One important
aspect of the recovery phase is assessing the extent of the damage in the built
environment through post-event building inspections. In this paper, we develop
and demonstrate a resilience-based methodology intended to support rapid
post-event decision-making about inspection priorities with limited
information. The method uses the basic characteristics of the building stock in
a community (floor area, number of stories, type of construction and
configuration) to assign structure-specific fragility functions to each
building. For an event with a given seismic intensity, the probability of each
building reaching a particular damage state is determined, and is used to
predict the actual building states and priorities for inspection. Losses are
computed based on building usage category, estimated inspection costs, the
consequences of erroneous decisions, and the potential for unnecessary
restrictions in access. The aim is to provide a means for a community to make
rapid cost-based decisions related to inspection of their building inventory.
We pose the decision problem as an integer optimization problem that attempts
to minimize the expected loss to the community. The advantages of this approach
are that it: (i) is simple, (ii) requires minimal inventory data, (iii) is
easily scalable, and (iv) does not require significant computing power. Use of
this approach before the hazard event can also provide a community with the
means to plan and allocate resources in advance of an event to achieve the
desirable resiliency goals of the community.
