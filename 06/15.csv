We address these questions with synthetic features introduced in a prior

path-integral molecular dynamics simulations, which allow us to consider
quantization of vibrational modes and study the effect of anharmonicity on
physical variables. Finite-temperature properties are analyzed in the range
from 12 to 2000~K. Our results for graphene bilayers are compared with those
found for graphene monolayers and graphite. Nuclear quantum effects turn out to
be appreciable in the layer area and interlayer distance at finite
temperatures. Differences in the behavior of in-plane and real areas of the
graphene sheets are discussed. The interlayer spacing has a zero-point
expansion of $1.5 \times 10^{-2}$ \AA\ with respect to the classical minimum.
The compressibility of graphene bilayers in the out-of-plane direction is found
to be similar to that of graphite at low temperature, and increases faster as
temperature is raised. The low-temperature compressibility increases by a 6\%
due to zero-point motion. Especial emphasis is laid upon atomic vibrations in
the out-of-plane direction. Quantum effects are present in these vibrational
modes, but classical thermal motion becomes dominant over quantum
delocalization for large system size. The significance of anharmonicities in
this atomic motion is estimated by comparing with a harmonic approximation for
the vibrational modes in graphene bilayers.

revealing a quasi-Keplerian central increase in projected rotation speed rising
from 280 km s$^{-1}$ at the disk's outer edge to $>400$ km s$^{-1}$ near the

twirling to turn coherent noise into incoherent Pauli channels. In this
Article, we show that some of the coherence of the noise channel can actually
be used to improve its logical fidelity by simply sandwiching the noise with a
chosen pair of Pauli gates, which we call Pauli conjugation. Using the optimal
Pauli conjugation, we can achieve a higher logical fidelity than using twirling
and doing nothing. We devise a way to search for the optimal Pauli conjugation
scheme and apply it to Steane code, 9-qubit Shor code and distance-3 surface
code under global coherent $Z$ noise. The optimal conjugation schemes show
improvement in logical fidelity over twirling while the weights of the
conjugation gates we need to apply are lower than the average weight of the
twirling gates. In our example noise and codes, the concatenated threshold
obtained using conjugation is consistently higher than the twirling threshold
and can be up to 1.5 times higher than the original threshold where no
mitigation is applied. Our simulations show that Pauli conjugation can be
robust against gate errors. With the help of logical twirling, the undesirable
coherence in the noise channel can be removed and the advantages of conjugation
over twirling can persist as we go to multiple rounds of quantum error
correction.

identification rates (i.e., Rank-1 Identification Rate, or Rank-1 IR) and
ROC-based measures such as equal error rate (EER). We studied these phenomena
with synthetic data as well as real data from a face recognition study. It is
well known that the Rank-1 IR declines with increasing gallery size. We have

regression approach with many desirable properties, including minimax
rate-optimality in estimating functions that belong to common reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). The approach, however, is computationally
intensive for large data sets, due to the need to operate on a dense $n \times
n$ kernel matrix, where $n$ is the sample size. Recently, various approximation
schemes for solving KRR have been considered, and some analyzed. Some
approaches such as Nystr\""{o}m approximation and sketching have been shown to
preserve the rate optimality of KRR. In this paper, we consider the simplest
approximation, namely, spectrally truncating the kernel matrix to its largest
$r < n$ eigenvalues. We derive an exact expression for the maximum risk of this
truncated KRR, over the unit ball of the RKHS. This result can be used to study
the exact trade-off between the level of spectral truncation and the
regularization parameter. We show that, as long as the RKHS is
infinite-dimensional, there is a threshold on $r$, above which, the
spectrally-truncated KRR surprisingly outperforms the full KRR in terms of the
minimax risk, where the minimum is taken over the regularization parameter.
This strengthens the existing results on approximation schemes, by showing that
not only one does not lose in terms of the rates, truncation can in fact
improve the performance, for all finite samples (above the threshold).
Moreover, we show that the implicit regularization achieved by spectral
truncation is not a substitute for Hilbert norm regularization. Both are needed
to achieve the best performance.

train SVMs on a D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer and study its performance in
comparison to SVMs trained on conventional computers. The method is applied to
both synthetic data and real data obtained from biology experiments. We find
that the quantum annealer produces an ensemble of different solutions that
often generalizes better to unseen data than the single global minimum of an
SVM trained on a conventional computer, especially in cases where only limited
training data is available. For cases with more training data than currently
fits on the quantum annealer, we show that a combination of classifiers for
subsets of the data almost always produces stronger joint classifiers than the
conventional SVM for the same parameters.

devices for graphene and has attracted a considerable amount of attention owing
to its structural similarity and semiconducting property. However, modifying
its wide-band gap is a challenge. Hydrogenation is a potential method of
altering the electrical properties, although is seldom experimentally measured.
Here, the complex permittivity of h-BN after various hydrogen treatments have
been investigated. For untreated h-BN, a frequency independent dielectric
constant was measured ($\sim4.2 \pm0.2$) and an immeasurably low dielectric
loss, demonstrating the ideal dielectric nature of h-BN across the $10^3$ to
$10^{10}$ Hz range. However, after atomic H-plasma treatment in a microwave
chemical vapour deposition (CVD) reactor, the complex permittivity amplifies
dramatically, introducing dielectric dispersion through Debye-type dielectric
relaxations ($\varepsilon_{\textrm{s}}\approx20\pm2$,
$\varepsilon_{\infty}\approx4.2\pm0.2$) and a percolating long range
conductivity ($\sim0.32$ mS/m). Annealing in molecular hydrogen at similar CVD
temperatures showed minimal effect. Raman spectroscopy also detected minimal
change in all samples, implying the increase is not due to other phases. This
leads to the experimental conclusion that hydrogenation, through atomic
H-plasma treatment, results in a moderate increase in room temperature
electrical conductivity, an associated finite dielectric loss factor. The
potential as a tunable wide-band gap semiconductor is highlighted however for
insulating dielectric substrate applications, microwave CVD may destroy these
desirable properties.

Multi-carrier Agile Radar (WMAR), which transmits/receives wideband waveforms
simultaneously with every antenna. To mitigate the demanding hardware

multi-Carrier AgilE phaSed Array Radar (CAESAR). CAESAR uses narrowband
monotone waveforms, thus facilitating ease of implementation of the system,

received signals of the proposed schemes, and develop an algorithm for
recovering the targets, based on concepts from compressed sensing to estimate
the range-Doppler parameters of the targets. We then derive conditions which
guarantee their accurate reconstruction. Our numerical study demonstrates that
both multi-carrier schemes improve performance compared to FAR while
maintaining its practical benefits. We also demonstrate that the performance of

challenging problem at the forefront of astrophysical cosmology. Although these
$z \geq 6$ galaxies are likely responsible for the last major phase change of
our Universe, the epoch of reionization (EoR), detailed studies are possible
only for relatively rare, bright objects. Characterizing the fainter galaxies
which are more representative of the population as a whole is currently done
mainly through their non-ionizing UV luminosity function (LF). Observing the
faint end of the UV LFs is nevertheless challenging, and current estimates can
differ by orders of magnitude.
  Here we propose a methodology to combine disparate high-$z$ UV LF data sets
in a Bayesian framework: Bayesian Data Averaging (BDA). Using a flexible,
physically-motivated galaxy model, we compute the relative evidence of various
$z=6$ UV LFs within the magnitude range $-20 \leq M_{\rm UV} \leq -15$ which is
common to the data sets. Our model, based primarily on power-law scalings of
the halo mass function, naturally penalizes systematically jagged data points
as well as mis-estimated errors. We then use the relative evidence to weigh the
posteriors obtained from disparate LF observations during the EoR, $6 \leq z
\leq 10$. The resulting LFs suggest that the star formation rate density (SFRD)
integrated down to a UV magnitude of -17 represent $60.9^{+11.3}_{-9.6}\%$ /
$28.2^{+9.3}_{-10.1}\%$ / $5.7^{+4.5}_{-4.7}\%$ of the total SFRD at redshifts

bear the imprint of planet-disk interactions, with non-Keplerian fine structure
in the molecular line channel maps. Such kinks or wiggles are affected by the
optical depth structure and synthesis imaging limitations, but their detail
could in principle be connected to the perturber by comparison with
hydrodynamical simulations. These predictions appear to have been observed in
HD163296 and HD97048, where the most conspicuous wiggles are interpreted in
terms of embedded planets. The velocity centroid maps may allow for more robust
indirect detections of embedded planets. The non-Keplerian velocity along the
planetary wakes undergoes an abrupt sign reversal across the protoplanet. After
subtraction of the disk rotation curve, the location of the perturber should be

functionals can be seen as limits of renormalized self-attractive energies as
well as limits of repulsive interactions between a set and its complement. We
also show that the functionals $H^\sigma$ and $J^\sigma$\,, up to a suitable
additive renormalization diverging when $\sigma\to 0$, belong to a continuous
one-parameter family of functionals, which for $\sigma=0$ gives back a new
object we refer to as {\it $0$-fractional perimeter}. All the convergence
results with respect to the parameter $\sigma$ and to the renormalization

the young Herbig star HD 100546, host to a prominent disk with a deep, wide gap
in the dust. The high-resolution 1.3 mm continuum observation reveals fine
radial and azimuthal substructures in the form of a complex maze of ridges and
trenches sculpting a dust ring. The $^{12}$CO(2-1) channel maps are modulated
by wiggles or kinks that deviate from Keplerian kinematics particularly over
the continuum ring, where deviations span 90$^\circ$ in azimuth, covering 5 km
s$^{-1}$. The most pronounced wiggle resembles the imprint of an embedded
massive planet of at least 5 M$_{\rm Jup}$ predicted from previous
hydrodynamical simulations (Perez, Casassus, & Benitez-Llambay 2018). Such
planet is expected to open a deep gap in both gas and dust density fields
within a few orbital timescales, yet the kinematic wiggles lie near ridges in
the continuum. The lesser strength of the wiggles in the $^{13}$CO and
C$^{18}$O isotopologues show that the kinematic signature weakens at lower disk
heights, and suggests qualitatively that it is due to vertical flows in the
disk surface. Within the gap, the velocity field transitions from Keplerian to
strongly non-Keplerian via a twist in position angle, suggesting the presence
of another perturber and/or an inner warp. We also present VLT/SPHERE sparse
aperture masking data which recovers scattered light emission from the gap's
edges but shows no evidence for signal within the gap, discarding a stellar
binary origin for its opening.

typical approach to pruning starts by training a model and then removing
redundant parameters while minimizing the impact on what is learned.
Alternatively, a recent approach shows that pruning can be done at
initialization prior to training, based on a saliency criterion called
connection sensitivity. However, it remains unclear exactly why pruning an
untrained, randomly initialized neural network is effective. In this work, by
noting connection sensitivity as a form of gradient, we formally characterize
initialization conditions to ensure reliable connection sensitivity
measurements, which in turn yields effective pruning results. Moreover, we
analyze the signal propagation properties of the resulting pruned networks and
introduce a simple, data-free method to improve their trainability. Our
modifications to the existing pruning at initialization method lead to improved
results on all tested network models for image classification tasks.
Furthermore, we empirically study the effect of supervision for pruning and
demonstrate that our signal propagation perspective, combined with unsupervised
pruning, can be useful in various scenarios where pruning is applied to
non-standard arbitrarily-designed architectures.

algorithm, Difference Maximization $Q$-learning (DMQ), combined with linear
function approximation, returns a near-optimal policy using a polynomial number
of trajectories. Our algorithm introduces a new notion, the Distribution Shift

predicts poorly on another distribution $\mathcal{D}_2$, where $\mathcal{D}_1$
and $\mathcal{D}_2$ are distributions over states induced by two different
exploration policies. For the linear function class, this oracle is equivalent
to solving a top eigenvalue problem. We believe our algorithmic insights,

audition, and touch. In this work, we investigate the cross-modal connection
between vision and touch. The main challenge in this cross-domain modeling task
lies in the significant scale discrepancy between the two: while our eyes
perceive an entire visual scene at once, humans can only feel a small region of
an object at any given moment. To connect vision and touch, we introduce new
tasks of synthesizing plausible tactile signals from visual inputs as well as
imagining how we interact with objects given tactile data as input. To
accomplish our goals, we first equip robots with both visual and tactile
sensors and collect a large-scale dataset of corresponding vision and tactile
image sequences. To close the scale gap, we present a new conditional
adversarial model that incorporates the scale and location information of the
touch. Human perceptual studies demonstrate that our model can produce
realistic visual images from tactile data and vice versa. Finally, we present
both qualitative and quantitative experimental results regarding different
system designs, as well as visualizing the learned representations of our
model.

vertices are chosen to be colored blue (the remainder being white) and then a
time step consists of every currently blue vertex forcing all of its neighbors
to become blue; this process stops when every vertex of the graph is blue, and
the process is called full forcing. The full throttling number of $G$ is then
defined to be the minimum sum of the cardinality of $B$ and the number of time
steps needed to complete the forcing process. On trees, the full throttling
number is equivalent to the throttling numbers of several other graph
processes, such as positive-semidefinite zero forcing, the game of cops and
robbers, and the distance domination number (alternately, the $k$-radius) of a
graph. For all of these, it is known that maximum possible throttling number
for a tree on $n$ vertices is somewhere between $1.4502\sqrt{n}$ and
$\frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}\sqrt{n}$, with the former exhibited by a family of
spiders. After introducing some new ideas and methods for working with
throttling on trees, this paper determines the exact full throttling number of
all balanced spiders (trees with equal-length paths extending from a center
vertex), and proves that their full throttling numbers are bounded above by
that of paths of the same order $n$, which are known to have full throttling
number $\lceil\sqrt{2n}-\frac{1}{2}\rceil$.

the effects of thermal dissociation and ionization included. Our best-fit model

a blackbody spectrum and instead exhibit emission due to H- shortward of 1.1

fluctuation in the data rather than a VO emission band as had been tentatively

calculated using the pre-calculated converged wave function of a rotating BEC
containing a smaller number of vortices as the initial state rather than using
an analytic wave function with one vortex as the initial state. These
pre-calculated initial states exhibit rapid convergence for fast-rotating
condensates to states containing multiple vortices with an appropriate phase
structure. This is illustrated here by calculating vortex lattices with up to
61 vortices in 2D and 3D. Outputs of the programs include calculated physical
quantities, as well as the wave function and different density profiles (full
density, integrated densities in lower dimensions, and density cross-sections).
The provided real-time propagation programs can be used to study the dynamics
of a rotating BEC using the imaginary-time stationary wave function as the

construct a three-dimensional spatio-kinematical model of the molecular gas in
IRAS 16342-3814. By reproducing the intensity distribution and
position-velocity diagram of the CO emission from the ALMA observations we
derived the morphology and velocity field of the gas. We used CO(1-0) data to
support the physical interpretation of the model. A spatio-kinematical model
that includes a high-velocity collimated outflow embedded within material
expanding at relatively lower velocity reproduces the images and
position-velocity diagrams from the observations. The high-velocity collimated
outflow exhibits deceleration across its length, while the velocity of the
surrounding component increases with distance. The morphology of the emitting
region; the velocity field and the mass of the gas as function of velocity are
in excellent agreement with the properties predicted for a molecular outflow
driven by a jet. The timescale of the molecular outflow is estimated to be
~70-100 years. An oscillating pattern was found associated to the high-velocity
collimated outflow. The oscillation period of the pattern is T~60-90 years and
its opening angle is ~2 degrees. The CO (3-2) emission in IRAS 16342-3814 is
interpreted in terms of a jet-driven molecular outflow expanding along an
elongated region. The position-velocity diagram and the mass spectrum reveal a
feature due to entrained material that is associated to the driving jet. It is
likely that the jet in those objects has already disappeared since it is
expected to last only for a couple of hundred years.

important processes to determine the architecture of planetary systems. A
sufficiently massive planet forms a density gap and migrates together with the
gap. By carrying out two-dimensional and two-fluid (gas and dust grains)
hydrodynamic simulations, we investigated the effects of the dust feedback on
the migration of the gap-opening planet, which was not considered in previous
studies. We found that the gas surface density at the outer edge of the gap
becomes smaller due to the dust feedback, and thus the torque exerted from the
outer disk decreases. This mechanism becomes effective as the gap becomes wider
and deeper. In particular, when the mass of the planet is Jupiter-size and
turbulent viscosity is $\alpha = 3\times 10^{-4}$, the planet can migrate
outward due to the reduction of the torque exerted from the outer disk. Even
for a smaller planet, the migration becomes significantly slow down. This
termination of the inward migration triggered by the dust feedback may explain
why ring and gap structures can be frequently observed within the
protoplanetary disks.

to infer the final mass of the halo to which each dark matter particle will
later belong. We then quantify the difference in the predictive accuracy
between machine learning models using a metric based on the Kullback-Leibler

contrast in the particles' local environment. The addition of tidal shear
information does not yield an improved halo collapse model over one based on
density information alone; the difference in their predictive performance is
consistent with the statistical uncertainty of the density-only based model.
This implies that our machine learning setup does not identify any significant
role for the tidal shear in determining halo masses. This result is confirmed
as we verify the ability of the initial conditions-to-halo mass mapping learnt

(SAGUARO), a comprehensive effort dedicated to the discovery and
characterization of optical counterparts to gravitational wave (GW) events.
SAGUARO utilizes ground-based facilities ranging from 1.5m to 10m in diameter,
located primarily in the Northern Hemisphere. We provide an overview of
SAGUARO's telescopic resources, pipeline for transient detection, and database
for candidate visualization. We describe SAGUARO's discovery component, which
utilizes the $5$~deg$^2$ field-of-view optical imager on the Mt. Lemmon 1.5m
telescope, reaching limits of $\approx 21.3$~AB mag while rapidly tiling large
areas. We also describe the follow-up component of SAGUARO, used for rapid
vetting and monitoring of optical candidates. With the onset of Advanced
LIGO/Virgo's third observing run, we present results from the first three
SAGUARO searches following the GW events S190408an, S190425z and S190426c,
which serve as a valuable proof-of-concept of SAGUARO. We triggered and
searched 15, 60 and 60 deg$^{2}$ respectively, 17.6, 1.4 and 41.8 hrs after the
initial GW alerts. We covered 7.8, 3.0 and 5.1\% of the total probability
within the GW event localizations, reaching 3$\sigma$ limits of 19.8, 21.3 and
20.8 AB mag, respectively. Although no viable counterparts associated with
these events were found, we recovered 6 known transients and ruled out 5
potential candidates. We also present Large Binocular Telescope spectroscopy of
PS19eq/SN2019ebq, a promising kilonova candidate that was later determined to
be a supernova. With the ability to tile large areas and conduct detailed
follow-up, SAGUARO represents a significant addition to GW counterpart
searches.

intergalactic plasma in clusters of galaxies, are largely unknown. While for
laboratory plasmas these characteristics are derived from the gas density and
temperature, such recipes can be fundamentally different for the intergalactic
plasma due to a low rate of particle collisions and a weak magnetic field. In
numerical simulations, one often cuts through these unknowns by modeling these
plasmas as hydrodynamic fluids, even though local, non-hydrodynamic features
observed in clusters contradict this assumption. Using deep Chandra
observations of the Coma Cluster, we probe gas fluctuations in intergalactic
medium down to spatial scales where the transport processes should prominently
manifest themselves - at least if hydrodynamic models with pure Coulomb
collision rates were indeed adequate. We find that they do not, implying that
the effective isotropic viscosity is orders of magnitude smaller than naively
expected. This indicates an enhanced collision rate in the plasma due to
particle scattering off microfluctuations caused by plasma instabilities, or
that the transport processes are anisotropic with respect to local magnetic
field. For that reason, numerical models with high Reynolds number appear more
consistent with observations. Our results also demonstrate that observations of
turbulence in clusters are becoming a branch of astrophysics that can sharpen
theoretical views on such plasmas.

suggested that a Proximate Damped Ly$\alpha$ system (PDLA) causes this peculiar

report the results of MUSE observations that reveal a new giant ($\approx$ 100
physical kpc) Lyman $\alpha$ nebula. The detailed analysis of the Ly$\alpha$
velocity, velocity dispersion, and surface brightness profiles suggests that
the J0952+0114 Ly$\alpha$ nebula shares similar properties of other QSO nebulae
previously detected with MUSE, implying that the PDLA in J0952+0144 is covering
only a small fraction of the QSO emission solid angle. We also detected bright
and spectrally narrow CIV$\lambda$1550 and HeII$\lambda$1640 extended emission
around J0952+0114 with velocity centroids similar to the peak of the extended

unresolved, and relatively broad HeII$\lambda$1640 emission in the central
region at exactly the same PDLA redshift hints at the possibility that the PDLA
originates in a clumpy outflow with a bulk velocity of about 500 km/s. The
smaller velocity dispersion of the large scale Ly$\alpha$ emission suggests
that the high-speed outflow is confined to the central region. Lastly, the
derived spatially resolved HeII/Ly$\alpha$ and CIV/Ly$\alpha$ maps show a
positive gradient with the distance to the QSO hinting at a non-homogeneous

standard picture of scalar ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) models. We explore
this idea along two directions. First, we investigate numerically oscillon
lifetimes and their dependence on the shape of the potential. We find that
scalar potentials that occur in well motivated axion-like models can lead to
oscillons that live up to $10^8$ cycles or more. Second, we discuss the
observational constraints on the ULDM models once the presence of oscillons is
taken into account. For a wide range of axion masses, oscillons decay around or
after matter-radiation equality and can thus act as early seeds for structure
formation. We also discuss the possibility that oscillons survive up to today.
In this case they can most easily play the role of dark matter.

these models are too narrow (by a factor of $\sim2$) in the region 0.06 - 0.32

simultaneous measurements of the bulk viscosity and the first Normal stress

  Here we propose a learning framework for predicting choice that is accurate,

that to account for how humans choose, predictive models must capture certain

edges yields a \emph{supracentrality matrix} $\mathbb{C}(\omega)$, where
$\omega$ controls the extent to which centrality trajectories change over time.
We can flexibly tune the weight and topology of the interlayer coupling to
cater to different scientific applications. The entries of the dominant
eigenvector of $\mathbb{C}(\omega)$ represent \emph{joint centralities}, which
simultaneously quantify the importance of every node in every time layer.
Inspired by probability theory, we also compute \emph{marginal} and
\emph{conditional centralities}. We illustrate how to adjust the coupling

for integral field instruments to yield a sampling of the sky image that is
both irregular and wavelength-dependent. Most subsequent analysis procedures
require a regular, wavelength independent sampling (for example a fixed
rectangular grid), and thus an initial step of fundamental importance is to
resample the data onto a new grid. The best possible resampling would produce a
well-sampled image, with a resolution equal to that imposed by the intrinsic
spatial resolution of the instrument, telescope, and atmosphere, and with no
statistical correlations between neighboring pixels. A standard method in the
field to produce a regular set of samples from an irregular set of samples is
Shepard's method, but Shepard's method typically yields images with a degraded
resolution and large statistical correlations between pixels. Here we introduce
a new method, which improves on Shepard's method in both these respects. We
apply this method to data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point
Observatory survey, part of Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV, demonstrating a
full-width half maximum close to that of the intrinsic resolution (and ~ 16%
better than Shepard's method) and low statistical correlations between pixels.
These results nearly achieve the ideal resampling. This method can have broader
applications to other integral field data sets and to other astronomical data
sets (such as dithered images) with irregular sampling.

cease to form the decomposition of unity and could be superefficient providing
the fidelity higher than any POVM-measurement protocol. However, one can
perform the complement of the Lorentz protocol to POVM-protocol by an
additional measurement operator. If the initial mixed state is close to the

spatial structure functions in a way that bypasses the need for Taylor's
Hypothesis. The spatial statistics agree with the classical counterparts, such
as the total kinetic energy spectrum, at least for spatial extents up to the
Taylor microscale. The requirements for applying the method is access to the
instantaneous velocity magnitude, in addition to the desired flow quantity, and
a high temporal resolution in comparison to the relevant time scales of the
flow. We map, without distortion and bias, notoriously difficult developing
turbulent high intensity flows using three main aspects that distinguish these
measurements from previous work in the field; 1) The measurements are conducted
using laser Doppler anemometry and are therefore not contaminated by
directional ambiguity (in contrast to, e.g., frequently employed hot-wire
anemometers); 2) The measurement data are extracted using a correctly and
transparently functioning processor and is analysed using methods derived from
first principles to provide unbiased estimates of the velocity statistics; 3)
The method is first confirmed to produce the correct statistics using computer
simulations and later applied to measurements in some of the most difficult
regions of a round turbulent jet -- the non-equilibrium developing region and
the outermost parts of the developed jet. The measurements in the developing
region reveal interesting features of an incomplete Richardson-Kolmogorov

fashion. Iso-contour maps of axial vorticity revealed a dominant primary vortex
and a weaker secondary one for $20^{\circ} \leq \beta \leq 40^{\circ}$. For
angles outside of this range, the helical symmetry was impaired due to the
emergence of additional flow effects. A model describing the flow has been
utilized, showing strong concurrence with the measurements, even though the
model is decoupled from external flow processes that could perturb the helical
symmetry. The pitch, vortex core size, circulation and the advection velocity
of the vortex all vary linearly with the device angle $\beta$. This is
important for flow control, since one thereby can determine the axial velocity
induced by the helical vortex as well as the swirl redistributing the axial
velocity component for a given device angle $\beta$. This also simplifies
theoretical studies, \eg to understand and predict the stability of the vortex

The ensemble average of the complex geometric phases for the pure stochastic

We show that the decoherence process described by the decaying amplitude can be
a geometric quantity independent of the system's dynamics. It is a remarkable
fact that the geometric phase of a quantum system can serve as an ideal
realisation of quantum gates due to its robustness against dynamical errors,
however, in this paper we show that, for some open quantum systems, a desirable
geometric phase may be accompanied by an unwanted robust geometric decoherence
factor. Two exactly solvable models are studied to demonstrate that, while the
decoherence is a purely dynamical effect for a dephasing two-level model, the

  in Correlated Noise",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a Neyman-Pearson (NP) distributed binary detection problem in a
bandwidth constrained wireless sensor network, where the fusion center (FC) is
responsible for fusing signals received from sensors and making a final
decision about the presence or absence of a signal source in correlated
Gaussian noises. Given this signal model, our goals are (i) to investigate
whether or not randomized transmission can improve detection performance, under
communication rate constraint, and (ii) to explore how the correlation among
observation noises would impact performance. To achieve these goals, we propose
two novel schemes that combine the concepts of censoring and randomized
transmission (which we name CRT-I and CRT-II schemes) and compare them with the
pure censoring scheme. In CRT (pure censoring) schemes, we map randomly
(deterministically) a sensor's observation to a ternary transmit symbol $u_k
\in \{-1,0,1\}$ where ``$0$'' corresponds to no transmission (sensor censors).
Assuming sensors transmit $u_k$'s over orthogonal fading channels, we formulate
and address two system-level constrained optimization problems: in the first
problem we minimize the probability of miss detection at the FC, subject to
constraints on the probabilities of transmission and false alarm at the FC; in
the second (dual) problem we minimize the probability of transmission, subject
to constraints on the probabilities of miss detection and false alarm at the
FC. Based on the expressions of the objective functions and the constraints in
each problem, we propose different optimization techniques to address these two
problems. Through analysis and simulations, we explore and provide the
conditions (in terms of communication channel signal-to-noise ratio, degree of
correlation among sensor observation noises, and maximum allowed false alarm
probability) under which CRT schemes outperform pure censoring scheme.

superconducting state, allowing phase coherence and supercurrent. It is
accessible experimentally through the penetration depth. Coexistence of
$d$-wave superconductivity with other phases in underdoped cuprates, such as
antiferromagnetism (AF) or charge-density waves (CDW), may drastically alter
$\rho_s$. To shed light on this physics, the zero-temperature value of
$\rho_s=\rho_{zz}$ along the $c$-axis was computed for different values of
Hubbard interaction $U$ and different sets of tight-binding parameters
describing the high-temperature superconductors YBCO and NCCO. We used Cellular
Dynamical Mean-Field Theory for the one-band Hubbard model with exact
diagonalization as impurity solver and state-of-the-art bath parametrization.
We conclude that Mott physics plays a dominant role in determining the
superfluid stiffness on the hole-doped side of the phase diagram. On the
electron-doped side, antiferromagnetism wins over superconductivity near
half-filling. But upon approaching optimal electron-doping, homogeneous
coexistence between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism causes the
superfluid stiffness to drop sharply. Hence, on the electron-doped side, it is
competition between antiferromagnetism and $d$-wave superconductivity that
plays a dominant role in determining the value of $\rho_{zz}$ near
half-filling. At large overdoping, $\rho_{zz}$ behaves in a more BCS-like
manner in both the electron- and hole-doped cases. We comment on some
qualitative implications of these results for the superconducting transition
temperature.

single-writer/multi-reader shared registers that can be read atomically.
Delporte-Gallet et al. proposed two fault-tolerant algorithms for snapshot
objects in asynchronous crash-prone message-passing systems. Their first
algorithm is \emph{non-blocking}; it allows snapshot operations to terminate
once all write operations have ceased. It uses $O(n)$ messages of $O(n \nu)$
bits, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $\nu$ is the number of bits it takes
to represent the object. Their second algorithm allows snapshot operations to
always terminate independently of write operations. It incurs $O(n^2)$
messages.
  The fault model of Delporte-Gallet et al. considers node crashes. We aim at
the design of even more robust snapshot objects via the lenses of
self-stabilization---a very strong notion of fault-tolerance. In addition to
Delporte-Gallet et al.'s fault model, our self-stabilizing algorithm can
recover after the occurrence of transient faults; these faults represent
arbitrary violations of the assumptions according to which the system was
designed to operate.
  We propose self-stabilizing variations of Delporte-Gallet et al.'s
non-blocking algorithm and always-terminating algorithm. Our algorithms have
similar communication costs to the ones by Delporte-Gallet et al. and $O(1)$
recovery time from transient faults. The main differences are that our proposal
considers repeated gossiping of $O(\nu)$ bit messages and deals with bounded
space. We also consider an input parameter, $\delta$, for which we claim an
ability to balance the costs of snapshot operations. We validate our
correctness proof, evaluate the performance of Delporte-Gallet et al.'s
algorithms and our proposed variations and investigate the properties of
$\delta$ via PlanetLab experiments, where significant latency and communication
costs reduction are observed.

stages. The aim of the present study was to assess whether/how early

aim was to investigate the relationship between alexithymic traits and

event-related potentials (ERP) in participants performing a fine discrimination
task of facial expressions while implementing an animal discrimination task as
control condition. In half of the experiment, participants could freely use
their facial mimicry whereas in the other half, they had their facial mimicry
blocked by a gel. Our results revealed that, on average, both P1 and N170 ERP
components were not sensitive to mimicry manipulation. However, when taking
into account alexithymic traits, a scenario corroborating sensorimotor
simulation models emerged, with two dissociable temporal windows affected by
mimicry manipulation as a function of alexithymia levels. Specifically, as a
function of mimicry manipulation, individuals with lower alexithymic traits
showed modulations of the P1 amplitude, while individuals with higher
alexithymic traits showed modulations of the later N170). Furthermore,
connectivity analysis at the scalp level suggested increased connectivity
between sensorimotor and extrastriate visual regions in individuals with lower

Overall, we interpreted these ERPs modulations as compensative visual
processing under conditions of interference on the sensorimotor processing.

data points that strongly activate a certain class but lack semantic meaning -

multicellular communities. In biofilms of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, we
recently discovered that some, but not all, cells participate in the
propagation of an electrical signal, and the ones that do are organized in a
way that is statistically consistent with percolation theory. However, two key
assumptions of percolation theory are violated in this system. First, we find
here that the probability for a cell to signal is not independent from other
cells but instead is correlated with its nearby neighbors. We develop a
mechanistic model, in which correlated signaling emerges from cell division,
phenotypic inheritance, and cell displacement, that reproduces the experimental
results. Second, we observed previously that the fraction of signaling cells is
not constant but instead varies from biofilm to biofilm. We use our model to
understand why percolation theory remains a valid description of the system
despite these two violations of its assumptions. We find that the first
violation does not significantly affect the spatial statistics, which we
rationalize using a renormalization argument. We find that the second violation
widens the range of signaling fractions around the percolation threshold at
which one observes the characteristic power-law statistics of cluster sizes,
consistent with our previous experimental results. We validate our model using
a mutant biofilm whose signaling probability decays along the propagation
direction. Our results identify key statistical features of a correlated
percolating system and demonstrate their functional utility for a multicellular
community.

daunting sizes and complexity of Jacobians encountered in general
three-dimensional flows. Jacobian-free iterative approaches such as Arnoldi
methods have greatly alleviated the required computational burden. However,
operations such as orthonormalization and shift-and-invert transformation of
matrices with appropriate shift guesses can stll introduce computational and
parameter-dependent costs that inhibit their routine application to general
three-dimensional flowfields. The present work addresses these limitations by
proposing and implementing a robust, generalizable approach to extract the
principal global modes, suited for curvilinear coordinates as well as the
effects of compressibility. Accurate linearized perturbation snapshots are
obtained using high-order schemes by leveraging the same non-linear
Navier-Stokes code as used to obtain the basic state by appropriately
constraining the equations using a body-force. It is shown that with random
impulse forcing, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) of the subspace formed by
these products yields the desired physically meaningful modes when
appropriately scaled. The leading eigenmodes are thus obtained without spurious
modes or the need for an iterative procedure. Further, since orthonormalization
is not required, large subspaces can be processed to capture converged low
frequency or stationary modes. The validity and versatility of the method are
demonstrated with numerous examples encompassing essential elements expected in
realistic flows, such as compressibility effects and complicated domains
requiring general curvilinear meshes. Favorable comparisons with Arnoldi-based
method, complemented with substantial savings in computational resources show
the potential of the current approach for relatively complex flows.

However, this
reliability comes at a cost: it can be challenging to write new prototypes in
(or migrate old code to) dependently-typed programming languages. Gradual
typing makes static type disciplines more flexible, so an appropriate notion of
gradual dependent types could fruitfully lower this cost. However, dependent
types raise unique challenges for gradual typing. Dependent typechecking
involves the execution of program code, but gradually-typed code can signal
runtime type errors or diverge. These runtime errors threaten the soundness
guarantees that make dependent types so attractive, while divergence spoils the
type-driven programming experience.
  This paper presents GDTL, a gradual dependently-typed language that
emphasizes pragmatic dependently-typed programming. GDTL fully embeds both an
untyped and dependently-typed language, and allows for smooth transitions
between the two. In addition to gradual types we introduce gradual terms ,
which allow the user to be imprecise in type indices and to omit proof terms;
runtime checks ensure type safety . To account for nontermination and failure,
we distinguish between compile-time normalization and run-time execution:
compile-time normalization is approximate but total, while runtime execution is
exact , but may fail or diverge. We prove that GDTL has decidable typechecking
and satisfies all the expected properties of gradual languages. In particular,
GDTL satisfies the static and dynamic gradual guarantees: reducing type
precision preserves typedness, and altering type precision does not change
program behavior outside of dynamic type failures. To prove these properties,
we were led to establish a novel normalization gradual guarantee that captures
the monotonicity of approximate normalization with respect to imprecision.

assumption in this area of research so far that a target download rate is
always attainable at every peer as long as coding operation is performed at all
the nodes in the network. An interesting study is made that a maximum download
rate can be attained by performing the coding operation at relatively small
portion of the network. The problem of finding the minimal set of node to
perform the coding operation and links to carry the coded data is called as a
network code minimization problem (NCMP). It is proved to be NP hard problem.
It can be solved using genetic algorithm (GA) because GA can be used to solve
the diverse NP hard problem. A new NCMP model is proposed which considers both
minimize the resources needed to perform coding operation and dynamic change in
network topology due to disconnection. Based on this new NCMP model, an
effective and novel GA is proposed by implementing problem specific GA
operators into the evolutionary process. There is an attempt to implement the
different compositions and several options of GA elements which worked well in
many other problems and pick the one that works best for this resource
minimization problem. Our simulation results prove that the proposed system
outperforms the random selection and coding at all possible node mechanisms in
terms of both download time and system throughput.

RECAL is made up of feature extraction layers which are convolutional, followed
by unsupervised classifier layers which is fully connected. A multinomial
logistic regression function (softmax) stacked on top of classifier layers. We
train this network using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer. However,
the successful implementation of our model is revolved around the design of

entails lower entropy given that the class distribution is not heavily skewed.
This is a trade-off between the situations of ""skewed distribution"" and

class entropy which are the two components of our loss function. In this
approach, size of the mini-batch should be kept high. Experimental results

enjoys enhanced ""$\frac{1}{2}$-Virasoro"" symmetry. General boundary correlators
are expected to be captured by the restriction of chiral correlators in a
suitable $\mathcal WA_{n}$ Virasoro extension. At next-to-leading order in weak
coupling expansion they have been conjectured to match the subleading terms in
the large central charge expansion of the dual $\mathcal WA_{n}$ correlators.
We explicitly test this conjecture on the boundary four point functions of the
Toda scalar fields dual to $\mathcal WA_{n}$ generators with next-to-minimal
spin 3 and 4. Our analysis is valid in the generic rank case and extends
previous results for specific rank-2 Toda theories. On the AdS side, the
extension is straightforward and requires the computation of a finite set of
tree Witten diagrams. This is due to simple rank dependence and selection rules
of cubic and quartic couplings. On the boundary, the CFT calculation is made
feasible by exploiting crossing symmetry and specific meromorphic properties of

deuteron and the nuclear forces binding it, a conjecture which was proven to be
on the right track after the discovery of the $X(3872)$. However, this analogy
with nuclear physics has not been seriously exploited beyond a few calculations
in the two- and three-body sectors, leaving a great number of possible
theoretical consequences unexplored. Here we show that nuclear and heavy hadron
effective field theories are formally identical: using a suitable notation,
there is no formal difference between these two effective field theories. For
this, instead of using the standard heavy superfield notation, we have written
the heavy hadron interactions directly in terms of the light quark degrees of
freedom. We give a few examples of how to exploit this analogy, e.g. the
calculation of the two-pion exchange diagrams. Yet the most relevant
application of the present idea is the conjecture of exotic nuclear landscapes,
i.e. the possibility of few heavy hadron bound states with characteristics
similar to those of the standard nuclei.

based on boundary sensitive network we propose a new temporal convolution
network called Multipath Temporal ConvNet (MTN), which consists of two parts
i.e. Multipath DenseNet and SE-ConvNet. In this work, one novel high
performance ring parallel architecture based on Message Passing Interface (MPI)

large memory occupation and a large number of videos. Remarkably, the total

traditional Parameter Server architecture, our parallel architecture has higher
efficiency on temporal action detection task with multiple GPUs, which is
suitable for dealing with the tasks of temporal action proposal generation,
especially for large datasets of millions of videos. We conduct experiments on
ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS14, where our method outperforms other state-of-art
temporal action detection methods with high recall and high temporal precision.

evaluate can be solved effectively by recursively fitting a surrogate function
to function samples and minimizing an acquisition function to generate new

vector where the surrogate is minimum (exploitation of the surrogate) and
looking for regions of the feasible space that have not yet been visited and
that may potentially contain better values of the objective function
(exploration of the feasible space). This paper proposes a new global
optimization algorithm that uses a combination of inverse distance weighting
(IDW) and radial basis functions (RBF) to construct the acquisition function.
Rather arbitrary constraints that are simple to evaluate can be easily taken
into account. Compared to Bayesian optimization, the proposed algorithm, that
we call GLIS (GLobal minimum using Inverse distance weighting and Surrogate
radial basis functions), is competitive and computationally lighter, as we show
in a set of benchmark global optimization and hyperparameter tuning problems.

lensing observable $\Delta \Sigma$ with the projected cluster-galaxy
cross-correlation function $w_{p,cg}$ and galaxy auto-correlation function
$w_{p,gg}$ can break the degeneracy between $\sigma_8$ and $\sigma_{\ln Mc}$ to

$w_{p,cg}$, and $w_{p,gg}$ with respect to $\sigma_8$, $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_{\ln
Mc}$ and halo occupation distribution (HOD) parameters describing the galaxy
population. We also compute covariance matrices motivated by the properties of
the Dark Energy Suvery (DES) cluster and weak lensing survey and the BOSS CMASS
galaxy redshift survey. For our fiducial scenario combining $\Delta \Sigma$,
$w_{p,cg}$, and $w_{p,gg}$ measured over $0.3-30.0 \; h^{-1} \; \mathrm{Mpc}$,
for clusters at $z=0.35-0.55$ above a mass threshold $M_c\approx 2\times

$\sigma_8$ while marginalizing over $\sigma_{\ln Mc}$ and all HOD parameters.
Reducing the mass threshold to $1\times 10^{14} \; h^{-1} \;
\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and adding a $z=0.15-0.35$ redshift bin sharpens this
constraint to $0.8\%$. The small scale $(r_p < 3.0 \; h^{-1} \; \mathrm{Mpc})$

techniques and also highlights its limitations. The consequences of choice of
different materials for 3-D printing are evaluated in this report.
Design/methodology/Approach- The parts were designed in CAD software and made
into Stereo lithography files, which were fed into the 3-D printing software.
They were printed with the selection of ABS material. Low torque servos were
employed in the beginning of the assembly and were controlled with the Arduino
Uno micro controller. Findings- The versatility of legged robots require
materials with high strength to weight ratio, where 3003 aluminium alloy sheets
proved to be a better choice than conventional ABS. The ABS legs buckled under
load and proved to be an inferior material choice for fabrication. The
aluminium sheet fabricated legs not only imparted structural stability to the
robot but also allowed in selection of more powerful servos for added
strength.The bot could now achieve significant level of stability. Research
Limitations/Implications- The power supply used for powering the bot was of
SMPS type of power supply which made it less mobile. Due to the huge demand of
current by the high torque servos used later, the power supply became a huge
limitation which can be overcome by applying Lithium ion batteries. Practical
Implications- The bot can be used for SLAM and autonomous navigation in areas
where it is almost impossible for humans to access into. Originality/Value-
This paper shows a concrete study on efficacy of quick CAD designing and rapid
fabrication.

optimization approach. The aim is to combine the benefits of both
parametrizations: the explicit geometric representation provides specific
controls on certain design regions while the implicit density representation
provides the ultimate design freedom elsewhere. This approach is particularly
suited for structural assemblies, where the optimization of the structural
topology is coupled with the optimization of the shape of the interface between
the sub-components in a unified formulation. The interface between the
assemblies is defined by a segmented profile made of linear geometric entities.
The geometric coordinates of the nodes connecting the profile segments are used
as shape variables in the problem, together with density variables as in
conventional topology optimization. The variable profile is used to locally
impose specific geometric constraints or to project particular material
properties. Examples of the properties considered herein are a local volume
constraint, a local maximum length scale control, a variable Young's modulus
for the distributed solid material, and spatially variable minimum and maximum
length scale. The resulting optimization approach is general and various
geometric entities can be used. The potential for complex design manipulations
is demonstrated through several numerical examples.

Various possible hypothetical structures: L21-I, L21-II, XA-I, and XA-II were

coordination pattern at low velocities with a constant relative lag time of
glide during the cycle and switch to a maximum propulsion force strategy at

account thermal and zero-point energy fluctuations. While these effects can
easily be estimated within a harmonic approximation, corrections arising from
the anharmonic nature of the interatomic potential are often crucial and
require computationally costly path integral simulations. Consequently,
different approximate frameworks for computing affordable estimates of the
anharmonic free energies have been developed over the years. Understanding
which of the approximations involved are justified for a given system is
complicated by the lack of comparative benchmarks. To facilitate this choice we
assess the accuracy and efficiency of some of the commonly used approximate
methods -- the vibrational self-consistent field and self-consistent phonons --
by comparing the anharmonic correction to the Helmholtz free energy against
reference path integral calculations. These benchmarks are performed for a
diverse set of systems, ranging from simple quasi-harmonic solids to flexible
molecular crystals with freely-rotating units. Our results suggest that for
simple solids such as allotropes of carbon these methods yield results that are
in excellent agreement with the reference calculations, at a considerably lower
computational cost. For more complex molecular systems such as polymorphs of
ice and paracetamol the methods do not consistently provide a reliable
approximation of the anharmonic correction. Despite substantial cancellation of
errors when comparing the stability of different phases, we do not observe a
systematic improvement over the harmonic approximation even for relative
free-energies. Our results suggest that efforts towards obtaining
computationally-feasible anharmonic free-energies for flexible molecular solids
should therefore be directed towards reducing the expense of path integral
methods

two-step frameworks are difficult to manipulate and usually lead to suboptimal
performance, mainly because the graph embedding is not goal-directed, i.e.,
designed for the specific clustering task. In this paper, we propose a
goal-directed deep learning approach, Deep Attentional Embedded Graph
Clustering (DAEGC for short). Our method focuses on attributed graphs to
sufficiently explore the two sides of information in graphs. By employing an
attention network to capture the importance of the neighboring nodes to a
target node, our DAEGC algorithm encodes the topological structure and node
content in a graph to a compact representation, on which an inner product
decoder is trained to reconstruct the graph structure. Furthermore, soft labels
from the graph embedding itself are generated to supervise a self-training
graph clustering process, which iteratively refines the clustering results. The
self-training process is jointly learned and optimized with the graph embedding
in a unified framework, to mutually benefit both components. Experimental
results compared with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the superiority
of our method.

we construct a specific form of weak solutions by employing the spin net-work

satisfy the quantum simplicity constraint via the vanishing expectation values,
and the quantum Gaussian constraints can be imposed strongly. Remarkably, those
specific ${SO(D+1)}$ coherent intertwiners used to construct our solutions have
natural interpretations of the $D$-dimensional polytopes, commonly viewed as
basic units of the discrete spatial geometry. Therefore, while the strong
imposition of the quantum simplicity constraints leads to an over-constrained
solution space, our weak solution space for the constraints may contain the
correct semiclassical degrees of freedom for intrinsic geometry of the spatial
hypersurfaces. Moreover, some concrete relations are established between our
construction and other existing approaches in solving the simplicity
constraints in all dimensional loop quantum gravity, providing valuable
insights into this unresolved important issue.

the influence of the static and dynamic types of atomic disorder on the
temperature changes in the spectral characteristics in question. To vary the
degree of static disorder in the model system, we have used a parameter
${\delta}$, which characterizes the QD dispersion in size over the ensemble.
Also, we have calculated the temperature shifts of the maxima and changes in
the half-width for the exciton peaks in single nanocrystals (${\delta}$ = 0),
as well as for the integrated OA bands in the QD ensembles with different
values of ${\delta}$ = 0.6 - 17%. The simulation results and the OA spectra
data measured for InP/ZnS nanocrystals of 2.1 nm (${\delta}$ = 11.1%) and 2.3
nm (${\delta}$ = 17.3%) are in good mutual agreement in the temperature range
of 6.5 K - RT. It has been shown that the contribution of static disorder to
the observed inhomogeneous broadening of the OA bands for the QDs at room
temperature exceeds 90%. The computational experiments performed indicate that
the temperature shift of the maximum for the integrated OA band coincides with
that for the exciton peak in a single nanocrystal. In this case, a reliable
estimate of the parameters of the fundamental exciton-phonon interaction can be
made. Simultaneously, the values of the specified parameters, calculated from
the temperature broadening of the OA spectra, can be significantly different
from the true ones due to the effects of static atomic disorder in real QD

discontinuity. The main results of the paper are local solvability and
stability of the considered inverse problems. Our approach is based on a
constructive algorithm for solving the inverse problems. The key role in our
method is played by the Riesz-basis property of a special vector-functional
system in a Hilbert space. In addition, we obtain a new uniqueness theorem for
recovering the potential on a part of the interval, by using a fractional part

where a quantity $\mathcal{D}$, the difference of bond strength~(DBS), is
introduced to judge whether a QPT is of first order or not. This method is
firstly applied to an exactly solvable spin-$1/2$ \textit{XXZ} Heisenberg chain
and a quantum Ising chain with longitudinal field where distinct jumps of
$\mathcal{D}$ appear at the first-order transition points for both cases. We
then use it to study the topological QPT of a cross-coupled~($J_{\times}$) spin
ladder where the Haldane--rung-singlet transition switches from being
continuous to exhibiting a first-order character at $J_{\times, I} \simeq$
0.30(2). Finally, we study a recently proposed one-dimensional analogy of
deconfined quantum critical point connecting two ordered phases in a spin-$1/2$

smooth when crossing the transition point. Moreover, we affirm that such

incorporating project selection mechanism into the threshold public goods game,
we have investigated the coupling effect of mutation and imitation in updating
one's preferred project scale on the evolution of cooperation. Compared with
the situation where there is no project selection mechanism, the existence of
project selection may suppress or promote cooperation depending upon different
updating rules. There exists a critical ratio of the imitators in the
population, below which cooperation is suppressed while above which cooperation
is promoted. With the coevolving of individual strategies and preferred project
scales, a higher level of cooperation corresponds to a larger average value of
the preferred project scales. A theoretical analysis indicates that, as most of
the individuals are mutants, the coevolving process is governed by the mutation
process, which leads to a smaller average value of the preferred project scales
and a lower level of cooperation. As most of the individuals are imitators, the
coevolving process is governed by the coupling of the mutation and imitation
processes, which leads to a larger average value of the preferred project

Towards this, the Yao's Millionaires' problem, i.e., to determine the richer

present a new solution to the Yao's Millionaires' problem namely, Privacy
Preserving Comparison (PPC). We show that PPC achieves this comparison in
constant time as well as in one execution. PPC uses semi-honest third parties
for the comparison who do not learn any information about the values. Further,
we show that PPC is collusion-resistance. To demonstrate the significance of
PPC, we present a secure, approximate single-minded combinatorial auction,
which we call TPACAS, i.e., Truthful, Privacy-preserving Approximate
Combinatorial Auction for Single-minded bidders. We show that TPACAS, unlike
previous works, preserves the following privacies relevant to an auction: agent
privacy, the identities of the losing bidders must not be revealed to any other
agent except the auctioneer (AU), bid privacy, the bid values must be hidden
from the other agents as well as the AU and bid-topology privacy, the items for
which the agents are bidding must be hidden from the other agents as well as
the AU. We demonstrate the practicality of TPACAS through simulations. Lastly,
we also look at TPACAS' implementation over a publicly distributed ledger, such
as the Ethereum blockchain.

one obtains a prime link. In a similar spirit, summing two prime alternating

understand whether it can be decomposed into two prime tangles each of which is

such a decomposition exists either it is visible in an alternating link diagram
or the link is of a particular form, which we call a pseudo-Montesinos link.

phases, including collecting training data for entity matching, debugging the
resulting clusters, confirming transformations applied on these clusters for
data standardization, and finally, reducing each cluster to a single, canonical
representation (or ""golden record""). The traditional wisdom is to sequentially
apply the human feedback, obtained by asking specific questions, within some
budget in each phase. However, these questions are highly correlated; the
answer to one can influence the outcome of any of the phases of the pipeline.
Hence, interleaving them has the potential to offer significant benefits.
  In this paper, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that interleaves
different types of questions to optimize human involvement. We propose benefit
models to measure the quality improvement from asking a question, and cost
models to measure the human time it takes to answer a question. We develop a
question scheduling framework that judiciously selects questions to maximize
the accuracy of the final golden records. Experimental results on three
real-world datasets show that our holistic method significantly improves the
quality of golden records from 70% to 90%, compared with the state-of-the-art

harnesses recent progresses in automated reasoning for higher-order logics and
aims at formalizing natural-language argumentative discourse using flexible
combinations of expressive non-classical logics. In doing so, it allows us to
render explicit the tacit conceptualizations implicit in argumentative
discursive practices. Our approach operates on networks of structured arguments
and is iterative and two-layered. At one layer we search for logically correct
formalizations for each of the individual arguments. At the next layer we
select among those correct formalizations the ones which honor the argument's
dialectic role, i.e. attacking or supporting other arguments as intended. We
operate at these two layers in parallel and continuously rate sentences'
formalizations by using, primarily, inferential adequacy criteria. An
interpretive, logical theory will thus gradually evolve. This theory is
composed of meaning postulates serving as explications for concepts playing a
role in the analyzed arguments. Such a recursive, iterative approach to
interpretation does justice to the inherent circularity of understanding: the
whole is understood compositionally on the basis of its parts, while each part
is understood only in the context of the whole (hermeneutic circle). We
summarily discuss previous work on exemplary applications of human-in-the-loop
computational hermeneutics in metaphysical discourse. We also discuss some of
the main challenges involved in fully-automating our approach. By sketching
some design ideas and reviewing relevant technologies, we argue for the

a stream of asynchronous ""events"" instead of intensity frames. They offer
significant advantages with respect to conventional cameras: high temporal
resolution, high dynamic range, and no motion blur. While the stream of events
encodes in principle the complete visual signal, the reconstruction of an
intensity image from a stream of events is an ill-posed problem in practice.
Existing reconstruction approaches are based on hand-crafted priors and strong
assumptions about the imaging process as well as the statistics of natural
images. In this work we propose to learn to reconstruct intensity images from
event streams directly from data instead of relying on any hand-crafted priors.
We propose a novel recurrent network to reconstruct videos from a stream of
events, and train it on a large amount of simulated event data. During training
we propose to use a perceptual loss to encourage reconstructions to follow
natural image statistics. We further extend our approach to synthesize color
images from color event streams. Our network surpasses state-of-the-art
reconstruction methods by a large margin in terms of image quality (> 20%),
while comfortably running in real-time. We show that the network is able to
synthesize high framerate videos (> 5,000 frames per second) of high-speed
phenomena (e.g. a bullet hitting an object) and is able to provide high dynamic
range reconstructions in challenging lighting conditions. We also demonstrate
the effectiveness of our reconstructions as an intermediate representation for
event data. We show that off-the-shelf computer vision algorithms can be
applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as object classification and
visual-inertial odometry and that this strategy consistently outperforms
algorithms that were specifically designed for event data.

demonstrated here. The large optical path entry and exit ports make it ideal

technologies such as Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) have been a point of
interest for researchers in recent years. In this paper, we explore the
application of a classical control methodology known as Exact Output Regulation
(EOR) for improving the control performance of a LIDAR-enhanced wind turbine.
The EOR controller is designed to achieve the rejection of known input
disturbances, while also ensuring the system output tracks a desired reference
signal. The controller is comprised of a state feedback controller together
with a feedforward gain. The LIDAR wind preview information is used to obtain a
low-order exosystem for modeling wind dynamics. This wind exosystem is used to
obtain the feedforward gain matrix that enables the EOR controller to
effectively reject the input disturbance and achieve the desired reference
tracking. Extensive simulations of the EOR controller with a broad range of
wind speeds in both partial load and full load operating regions are performed
on the full nonlinear aero-elastic model of the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL) 5 MW reference wind turbine. For performance comparisons, we
also implement a baseline torque controller and a commonly used feedforward
control method known as Disturbance Accommodation Control (DAC). The results
show that, in comparison with a baseline and DAC controller, the EOR controller
can provide substantially improved reduction of fatigue loads and smoother
power output, without compromising energy production levels.

promises of ridesharing for alleviating congestion in cities may be undermined
by a number of challenges, including the growing number of proposed services
and the subsequent increasing number of vehicles, as a natural consequence of
competition. In this work, we present optimization-based approaches to model
cooperation and competition between multiple ridesharing companies, in a
real-time on-demand setting. A recent trend relies on solving the integrated
combination of Dial-A-Ride Problems (DARP), which compute the cost of assigning
incoming requests to vehicle routes, plus Linear Assignment Problems (LAP),
which assign vehicles to requests. While the DARPs, are solved at the level of
the vehicles of each company, we introduce cooperative and competitive
approaches to solve the LAP. The cooperative model, which could make use of
Mobility as a Service platforms, is shown to solve the LAP to optimality
following closely results from the literature, and limiting the amount of
information the companies are required to share. We investigate how a realistic
model of competition deviates from this optimality and provide worst case
bounds. We evaluate these models with respect to a centralized model on
one-week instances of the New York City taxi dataset. Model variants coping
with noise in the travel time estimations, bias in the assignment costs, and
preferences in the competitive case are also presented and validated. The
computational results suggest that cooperation among ridesharing companies can
be conducted in such a way to limit the degradation of the level of service
with respect to a centralized model. Finally, we argue that the competition can
lower the quality of the ridesharing service, especially in the case customer
preferences are accommodated.
