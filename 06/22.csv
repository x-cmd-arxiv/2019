face several challenging problems: (1) the hardness of modeling the long-term
user interests from sparse implicit feedback; (2) the difficulty of capturing
the short-term user interests given several items the user just accessed. To
cope with these challenges, we propose a hierarchical gating network (HGN),
integrated with the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) to capture both the
long-term and short-term user interests. Our HGN consists of a feature gating
module, an instance gating module, and an item-item product module. In
particular, our feature gating and instance gating modules select what item
features can be passed to the downstream layers from the feature and instance
levels, respectively. Our item-item product module explicitly captures the item
relations between the items that users accessed in the past and those items
users will access in the future. We extensively evaluate our model with several
state-of-the-art methods and different validation metrics on five real-world

how to use these instances to detect discrimination by constructing a
""flipset"": the set of individuals whose classifier output changes
post-translation, which corresponds to the set of people who may be harmed

given subgroup differently, FlipTest produces a ""transparency report"": a
ranking of features that are most associated with the model's behavior on the

logspace Turing machines, which provide a unifying framework for efficient
query evaluation in areas like information extraction and graph databases,
among others. We investigate the complexity of three fundamental algorithmic
problems for these classes: enumeration, counting and uniform generation of
solutions, and show that they have several desirable properties in this
respect.
  Both complexity classes are defined in terms of non-deterministic logspace
transducers (NL transducers). For the first class, we consider the case of
unambiguous NL transducers, and we prove constant delay enumeration, and both
counting and uniform generation of solutions in polynomial time. For the second
class, we consider unrestricted NL transducers, and we obtain polynomial delay
enumeration, approximate counting in polynomial time, and polynomial-time
randomized algorithms for uniform generation. More specifically, we show that
each problem in this second class admits a fully polynomial-time randomized
approximation scheme (FPRAS) and a polynomial-time Las Vegas algorithm for
uniform generation. Interestingly, the key idea to prove these results is to
show that the fundamental problem $\text{#NFA}$ admits an FPRAS, where
$\text{#NFA}$ is the problem of counting the number of strings of length $n$
(given in unary) accepted by a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA). While
this problem is known to be $\text{#P}$-complete and, more precisely,
$\text{SpanL}$-complete, it was open whether this problem admits an FPRAS. In
this work, we solve this open problem, and obtain as a welcome corollary that
every function in $\text{SpanL}$ admits an FPRAS.

system thermalizes to the canonical ensemble, or the grand canonical ensemble,
etc., depending on the conserved quantities. The conserved quantities are
represented by operators usually assumed to commute with each other. This
assumption was removed within quantum-information-theoretic (QI-theoretic)
thermodynamics recently. The small system's long-time state was dubbed ``the
non-Abelian thermal state (NATS).'' We propose an experimental protocol for
observing a system thermalize to the NATS. We illustrate with a chain of spins,
a subset of which form the system of interest. The conserved quantities
manifest as spin components. Heisenberg interactions push the conserved
quantities between the system and the effective bath, the rest of the chain. We
predict long-time expectation values, extending the NATS theory from abstract
idealization to finite systems that thermalize with finite couplings for finite
times. Numerical simulations support the analytics: The system thermalizes to
the NATS, rather than to the canonical prediction. Our proposal can be
implemented with ultracold atoms, nitrogen-vacancy centers, trapped ions,
quantum dots, and perhaps nuclear magnetic resonance. This work introduces
noncommuting conserved quantities from QI-theoretic thermodynamics into quantum
many-body physics: atomic, molecular, and optical physics and condensed matter.

MeV in the ""hidden sector"", which mixes at tree level with the standard Higgs
$h_W$ and hence acquires small couplings to quarks and leptons which can be
calculated in the FSM apart from the mixing parameter $\rho_{Uh}$. The exchange
of this mixed state $U$ will contribute to $g - 2$ and to the Lamb shift. By
adjusting $\rho_{Uh}$ alone, it is found that the FSM can satisfy all present
experimental bounds on the $g - 2$ and Lamb shift anomalies for $\mu$ and $e$,
and for the latter for both hydrogen and deuterium.
  The FSM predicts also a $1^-$ boson in the ""hidden sector"" with a mass of 17
MeV, that is, right on top of the Atomki anomaly $X$. This mixes with the
photon at 1-loop level and couples thereby like a dark photon to quarks and
leptons. It is however a compound state and is thought likely to possess
additional compound couplings to hadrons. By adjusting the mixing parameter and
the $X$'s compound coupling to nucleons, the FSM can reproduce the production
rate of the $X$ in beryllium decay as well as satisfy all the bounds on $X$
listed so far in the literature.
  The above two results are consistent in that the $U$, being $0^+$, does not
contribute to the Atomki anomaly if parity and angular momentum are conserved,
while $X$, though contributing to $g - 2$ and Lamb shift, has smaller couplings
than $U$ and can, at first instance, be neglected there.
  Despite the tentative nature of the 3 anomalies in experiment and of the FSM
as theory, the accommodation of the former in the latter has strengthened the
credibility of both. If this FSM interpretation were correct, it would change
the whole aspect of the anomalies from just curiosities to windows into a vast
hitherto hidden sector comprising at least in part the dark matter which makes
up the bulk of our universe.

contribution that is at most cubic in components of the $Q$-tensor and their
derivatives, the alternative offered here is quartic in these variables. One
clear advantage of our approach over the cubic theory is that the associated
minimization problem is well-posed for a significantly wider choice of elastic
constants. In particular, quartic energy can be used to model
nematic-to-isotropic phase transitions for highly disparate elastic constants.

problems, recently, some empirical studies of DNNs reported a universal
phenomenon of Frequency Principle (F-Principle): a DNN tends to learn a target
function from low to high frequencies during the training. The F-Principle has
been very useful in providing both qualitative and quantitative understandings
of DNNs. In this paper, we rigorously investigate the F-Principle for the
training dynamics of a general DNN at three stages: initial stage, intermediate
stage, and final stage. For each stage, a theorem is provided in terms of
proper quantities characterizing the F-Principle. Our results are general in
the sense that they work for multilayer networks with general activation
functions, population densities of data, and a large class of loss functions.
Our work lays a theoretical foundation of the F-Principle for a better
understanding of the training process of DNNs.

transport which is governed by the amount of coherence that configuration space
states possess with respect to the Hamiltonian eigenbasis. To make this
observation precise, we study the localization transition via quantum coherence
measures arising from the resource theory of coherence. We show that the escape
probability, which is known to show distinct behavior in the ergodic and
localized phases, arises naturally as the average of a coherence measure.
Moreover, using the theory of majorization, we argue that broad families of

localization. We provide supporting numerical evidence for Anderson and
Many-Body Localization (MBL).
  For infinitesimal perturbations of the Hamiltonian, the differential
coherence defines an associated Riemannian metric. We show that the latter is
exactly given by the dynamical conductivity, a quantity of experimental

formulated as a pairwise bipartite ranking problem: ideally, the larger the
probability that two observations in the feature space belong to the same class
(or share the same label), the higher the similarity measure between them. From
this perspective, the ROC curve is an appropriate performance criterion and it
is the goal of this article to extend recursive tree-based ROC optimization
techniques in order to propose efficient similarity learning algorithms. The
validity of such iterative partitioning procedures in the pairwise setting is
established by means of results pertaining to the theory of U-processes and
from a practical angle, it is discussed at length how to implement them by

is modeled as a maximum of $k$ unknown affine functions for a fixed $k \geq 1$.
This generalizes linear regression and (real) phase retrieval, and is closely
related to convex regression. Working within a non-asymptotic framework, we
study this problem in the high-dimensional setting assuming that $k$ is a fixed
constant, and focus on estimation of the unknown coefficients of the affine
functions underlying the model. We analyze a natural alternating minimization
(AM) algorithm for the non-convex least squares objective when the design is
random. We show that the AM algorithm, when initialized suitably, converges
with high probability and at a geometric rate to a small ball around the
optimal coefficients. In order to initialize the algorithm, we propose and
analyze a combination of a spectral method and a random search scheme in a
low-dimensional space, which may be of independent interest. The final rate
that we obtain is near-parametric and minimax optimal (up to a poly-logarithmic
factor) as a function of the dimension, sample size, and noise variance. In
that sense, our approach should be viewed as a direct and implementable method
of enforcing regularization to alleviate the curse of dimensionality in
problems of the convex regression type. As a by-product of our analysis, we
also obtain guarantees on a classical algorithm for the phase retrieval problem
under considerably weaker assumptions on the design distribution than was

of exchangeability, which postulates that the distribution of the observations

methods of testing the two hypotheses concentrating on the online mode of
testing, when the observations arrive sequentially. All known online methods
for testing these hypotheses are based on conformal martingales, which are

aspects and states two kinds of results. Validity results limit the probability
of a false alarm or the frequency of false alarms for various procedures based
on conformal martingales, including conformal versions of the CUSUM and
Shiryaev-Roberts procedures. Efficiency results establish connections between
randomness, exchangeability, and conformal martingales.

Information Retrieval with Coded Side Information (PIR-CSI)} problem. In this
problem, there are $K$ messages replicated across $N$ servers, and there is a
user who wishes to download one message from the servers without revealing any
information to any server about the identity of the requested message. The user
has a side information which is a linear combination of a subset of $M$
messages in the database. The parameter $M$ is known to all servers in advance,
whereas the indices and the coefficients of the messages in the user's side
information are unknown to any server \emph{a priori}.
  We focus on a class of PIR-CSI schemes, referred to as \emph{server-symmetric
schemes}, in which the queries/answers to/from different servers are symmetric
in structure. We define the \emph{rate} of a PIR-CSI scheme as its minimum
download rate among all problem instances, and define the
\emph{server-symmetric capacity} of the PIR-CSI problem as the supremum of
rates over all server-symmetric PIR-CSI schemes. Our main results are as
follows: (i) when the side information is not a function of the user's
requested message, the capacity is given by
${(1+{1}/{N}+\dots+{1}/{N^{\left\lceil \frac{K}{M+1}\right\rceil -1}})^{-1}}$
for any ${1\leq M\leq K-1}$; and (ii) when the side information is a function
of the user's requested message, the capacity is equal to $1$ for $M=2$ and
$M=K$, and it is equal to ${N}/{(N+1)}$ for any ${3 \leq M \leq K-1}$. The
converse proofs rely on new information-theoretic arguments, and the
achievability schemes are inspired by our recently proposed scheme for
single-server PIR-CSI as well as the Sun-Jafar scheme for multi-server PIR.

Recent numerical modeling efforts have demonstrated the increasing complexity
of the initial mass distribution of planetesimals. To better constrain this
distribution, we conduct SI simulations including the self-gravity with
hitherto the highest resolution. To subsequently identify all of the self-bound
clumps, we develop a new clump-finding tool, PLanetesimal ANalyzer
(\texttt{PLAN}). We then apply a maximum likelihood estimator to fit a suite of
parameterized models with different levels of complexity to the simulated mass
distribution. To determine which models are best-fitting and statistically
robust, we apply three model selection criteria with different complexity
penalties. We find that the initial mass distribution of clumps is not
universal regarding both the functional forms and parameter values. Our model
selection criteria prefer models different from those previously considered in
the literature. Fits to multi-segment power law models break to a steeper
distribution above masses close to 100 km collapsed planetesimals, similar to
observed Kuiper Belt size distributions. We find evidence for a turnover in the
low mass end of the planetesimal mass distribution in our high resolution run.
Such a turnover is expected for gravitational collapse, but had not previously
been reported.

low-metallicity environment. The early part of the observed light curves shows
the presence of excess emission above what is predicted in model calculations,
suggesting there is interaction between the ejecta and circumstellar material.

bilayer graphene (MATBG) has ignited considerable interest in understanding the
nature of electronic interactions in this chemically pristine material system.
The phenomenological similarity of the MATBG transport properties as a function
of doping with those of the high-Tc cuprates and other unconventional
superconductors suggests the possibility that MATBG may be a highly interacting
system. However, there have not been any direct experimental evidence for
strong many-body correlations in MATBG. Here we provide such evidence from
using high-resolution spectroscopic measurements, as a function of carrier
density, with a scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We find MATBG to display
unusual spectroscopic characteristics that can be attributed to
electron-electron interactions over a wide range of doping, including when
superconductivity emerges in this system. We show that our measurements cannot
be explained with a mean-field approach for modeling electron-electron
interaction in MATBG. The breakdown of a mean-field approach for understanding
the properties of other correlated superconductors, such as cuprates, has long
inspired the study of highly correlated Hubbard model. We show that a
phenomenological extended Hubbard model cluster calculation, motivated by the
nearly localized nature of the relevant electronic states of MATBG produces
spectroscopic features similar to those we observe experimentally. Our findings
demonstrate the critical role of many-body correlations in understanding the
properties of MATBG.

gas that will form future generations of stars. However, due to our inability
to track the time evolution of individual molecular clouds, quantifying the
exact role of feedback on their star formation history is an observationally
challenging task. In the present study, we take advantage of the unique
properties of the G316.75-00.00 high-mass star-forming ridge to determine how
feedback from O-stars impacts the dynamical stability of filaments. G316.75 is
a 13.6pc long ridge containing 18,900Msun of H2 gas which is half IR dark, half
IR bright. The IR bright half has already formed 4 O-type stars over the past
2Myr, while the IR dark half is still quiescent. Therefore, by assuming the gas
properties of the dark part represents an earlier evolutionary stage of the
bright part, we can quantify how feedback impacts these properties by
contrasting them. We use archive Herschel and molecular line data, tracing both
dense (NH3 and N2H+) and more diffuse (13CO) gas, to measure the ratio of
kinetic to gravitational energy per-unit-length, virial-ratio-per-line, across
the ridge for a range of gas volume densities. We show that despite the
presence of 4 embedded O-stars, feedback cannot unbind the ridge's mass except
for some small gas pockets near the O-stars. In fact, the virial-ratio-per-line
is almost indistinguishable for both parts of the ridge. These results are at
odds with most simulations where O-star-forming clouds are dispersed by
feedback within a few cloud free-fall time. We conclude that the discrepancy
between such simulations and our observations originates from different cloud
morphologies and average densities when the first O-star forms. These results
have important implications regarding, for instance, how feedback is
implemented within cosmological and galactic-scale simulations.

naturally are the Rindler vacuum (R) and the Minkowski vacuum (M). We disuss
several aspects of the Rindler vacuum, concentrating on the propagator and
Schwinger (heat) kernel defined using R, both in the Lorentzian and Euclidean
sectors. We start by exploring an intriguing result due to Candelas and Raine ,
viz., that $G_{R}$, the Feynman propagator corresponding to R, can be expressed
as a curious integral transform of $G_{M}$, the Feynman propagator in M. We
show that, this relation actually follows from the well known result that,
$G_{M}$ can be written as a periodic sum of $G_{R}$, in the Rindler time
$\tau$, with the period $2\pi i$. We further show that, the integral transform
result holds for a wide class of pairs of bi-scalars $(F_{M},F_{R})$, provided
$F_{M}$ can be represented as a periodic sum of $F_{R}$ with period $2\pi i$.
We provide an explicit procedure to retrieve $F_{R}$ from its periodic sum
$F_{M}$, for a wide class of functions. An example of particular interest is
the pair of Schwinger kernels $(K_{M},K_{R})$, corresponding to the Minkowski
and the Rindler vacua. We obtain explicit expression for $K_{R}$ and clarify
several conceptual and technical issues related to these biscalars both in the
Euclidean and Lorentzian sector. In particular we address the issue of
retrieving the information contained in all the four wedges of the Rindler
frame in the Lorentzian sector, starting from the Euclidean Rindler (polar)
coordinates. This is possible but require four different types of analytic
continuations, based on one unifying principle. Our procedure allows
generalisation of these results to any (bifurcate Killing) horizon in curved

SurfCon that leverages two important types of information in the privacy-aware

enables us to detect synonyms that look similar while the global context module
plays a complementary role to discover synonyms that are semantically similar

unseen in training and are thus out-of-vocabulary (OOV). While grapheme or
wordpiece E2E models might have a difficult time spelling OOV words, phonemes
are more acoustically salient and past work has shown that E2E phoneme models
can better predict such words. In this work, we propose an E2E model containing
both English wordpieces and phonemes in the modeling space, and perform
contextual biasing of foreign words at the phoneme level by mapping
pronunciations of foreign words into similar English phonemes. In experimental
evaluations, we find that the proposed approach performs 16% better than a
grapheme-only biasing model, and 8% better than a wordpiece-only biasing model
on a foreign place name recognition task, with only slight degradation on
regular English tasks.

the complexity of the power system due to their intermittent characteristics
and lower inertial response, such as photovoltaic (PV) systems and wind
turbines. This restructuring of the power system has a considerable effect on
the transient response of the system resulting in inter-area oscillations, less
synchronized coupling and power swings. Furthermore, the concept of being
distributed itself and generating electricity from multiple locations in the
power system makes the transient impact of DERs even worse by raising issues
such as reverse power flows. This paper studies some impacts of the changing
nature of power system which are limiting the large scale integration of DERs.
In addition, a solution to increase the inertial response of the system is
addressed by adding virtual inertia to the inverter based DERs in the power
system. The proposed control results in increasing the stability margin and
tracking the rated frequency of the system. The injected synchronized active
power to the system will prevent the protection relays from tripping by
improving the rate of change of frequency. The proposed system operation is
implemented on a sample power grid comprising of generation, transmission and
distribution and results are verified experimentally through the Opal-RT

approaches to estimate causal effects when the number of potential confounders
is prohibitively large. This growth in interest has led to a number of
potential estimators one could use in this setting. Each of these estimators
has different operating characteristics, and it is unlikely that one estimator
will outperform all others across all possible scenarios. Coupling this with
the fact that an analyst can never know which approach is best for their
particular data, we propose a synthetic estimator that averages over a set of
candidate estimators. Averaging is widely used in statistics for problems such
as prediction, where there are many possible models, and averaging can improve
performance and increase robustness to using incorrect models. We show that
these ideas carry over into the estimation of causal effects in
high-dimensional scenarios. We show theoretically that averaging provides
robustness against choosing a bad model, and show empirically via simulation
that the averaging estimator performs quite well, and in most cases nearly as
well as the best among all possible candidate estimators. Finally, we
illustrate these ideas in an environmental wide association study and see that
averaging provides the largest benefit in the more difficult scenarios that
have large numbers of confounders.

selling multiple items to multiple buyers. We consider the case where the
seller has costs to produce the items, and these costs are private information
to the seller. How can the seller design a mechanism to maximize her profit?
Two well-studied problems, revenue maximization in multi-item auctions and
signaling in ad auctions, are special cases of our problem. We show that there
exists a simple mechanism whose profit is at least $\frac{1}{44}$ of the
optimal profit for multiple buyers with matroid-rank valuation functions. When
there is a single buyer, the approximation factor is $11$ for general
constraint-additive valuations and $6$ for additive valuations. Our result
holds even when the seller's costs are correlated across items.
  We introduce a new class of mechanisms called permit-selling mechanisms. For
single buyer case these mechanisms are quite simple: there are two stages. For
each item $j$, we create a separate permit that allows the buyer to purchase
the item in the second stage. In the first stage, we sell the permits without
revealing any information about the costs. In the second stage, the seller
reveals all the costs, and the buyer can buy item $j$ by paying the item price
if the buyer has purchased the permit for item $j$ in the first stage. We show
that either selling the permits separately or as a grand bundle suffices to
achieve the constant factor approximation to the optimal profit (6 for
additive, and 11 for constrained additive). For multiple buyers, we sell the
permits sequentially and obtain the constant factor approximation. Our proof is
enabled by constructing a benchmark for the optimal profit by combining a novel
dual solution with the existing ex-ante relaxation technique.

implications in star formation, progenitor models, evolution channels and
cosmology measurements. The crucial component of any rate calculation is the
detectability and space-time volume sensitivity of a survey to a particular
transient type as a function of many intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. Fully
sampling that multi-dimensional parameter space is challenging. Instead, we
present a scheme to assess the detectability of transients using supervised
machine learning. The data product is a classifier that determines the
detection likelihood of sources resulting from an image subtraction pipeline
associated with time domain survey telescopes, taking into consideration the
intrinsic properties of the transients and the observing conditions. We apply
our method to assess the space-time volume sensitivity of type Ia supernovae
(SNe~Ia) in the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) and obtain the
result,$\langle VT\rangle_{\mathrm{Ia}}=2.93\pm 0.21\times
10^{-2}\mathrm{Gpc^{3}yr}$. With rate estimates in the literature, this volume
sensitivity gives a count of $680-1160$ SNe~Ia detectable by iPTF which is
consistent with the archival data. With a view toward wider applicability of
this technique we do a preliminary computation for long-duration type IIp
supernovae (SNe~IIp) and find $\langle
VT\rangle_{\mathrm{IIp}}=7.80\pm0.76\times10^{-4}\mathrm{Gpc^{3}yr}$. This
classifier can be used for computationally fast space-time volume sensitivity
calculation of any generic transient type using their lightcurve properties.
Hence, it can be used as a tool to facilitate calculation of transient rates in
a range of time-domain surveys, given suitable training sets.

gradient and value-based methods. We show through extensive experiments and
analysis that, when trained with policy gradient, recurrent neural networks
often fail to learn a state representation that leads to an optimal policy in
settings where the same action should be taken at different states. To explain
this failure, we highlight the problem of state aliasing, which entails
conflating two or more distinct states in the representation space. We
demonstrate that state aliasing occurs when several states share the same
optimal action and the agent is trained via policy gradient. We characterize
this phenomenon through experiments on a simple maze setting and a more complex
text-based game, and make recommendations for training RNNs with reinforcement

methods for generating functions of dissipative processes, including
discrete-state stochastic processes, dissipative dynamical systems, and
decohering quantum densities. The stationary trajectories of these integrals
describe a conserved current by Liouville's theorem, despite the fact that
there is no conserved phase space current in the underlying stochastic process.
We develop the information geometry of generating functions for discrete-state
classical stochastic processes in the Doi-Peliti 2FFI form, showing that the
conserved current is a Fisher information between the underlying distribution
of the process and the tilting weight of the generating function. To give an
interpretation to the time invertibility implied by current conservation, we
use generating functions to represent importance sampling protocols, and show
that the conserved Fisher information is the differential of a sample volume
under deformations of the nominal distribution and the likelihood ratio. We
derive a new pair of dual Riemannian connections respecting the symplectic
structure of transport along stationary rays that gives rise to Liouville's
theorem, and show that dual flatness in the affine coordinates of the
coherent-state basis captures the special role played by coherent states in
many 2FFI theories. The covariant convective derivative under time translation
correctly represents the geometric invariants of generating functions under
canonical transformations of the 2FFI field variables of integration.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent studies show that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial
examples which can be generated via certain types of transformations. Being
robust to a desired family of adversarial attacks is then equivalent to being
invariant to a family of transformations. Learning invariant representations
then naturally emerges as an important goal to achieve which we explore in this
paper within specific application contexts. Specifically, we propose a
cyclically-trained adversarial network to learn a mapping from image space to
latent representation space and back such that the latent representation is
invariant to a specified factor of variation (e.g., identity). The learned
mapping assures that the synthesized image is not only realistic, but has the
same values for unspecified factors (e.g., pose and illumination) as the
original image and a desired value of the specified factor. Unlike disentangled
representation learning, which requires two latent spaces, one for specified
and another for unspecified factors, invariant representation learning needs
only one such space. We encourage invariance to a specified factor by applying
adversarial training using a variational autoencoder in the image space as
opposed to the latent space. We strengthen this invariance by introducing a
cyclic training process (forward and backward cycle). We also propose a new
method to evaluate conditional generative networks. It compares how well
different factors of variation can be predicted from the synthesized, as
opposed to real, images. In quantitative terms, our approach attains
state-of-the-art performance in experiments spanning three datasets with
factors such as identity, pose, illumination or style. Our method produces
sharp, high-quality synthetic images with little visible artefacts compared to
previous approaches.

privacy concerns. In this work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving data
Generative model based on the PATE framework (G-PATE), aiming to train a
scalable differentially private data generator that preserves high generated
data utility. Our approach leverages generative adversarial nets to generate
data, combined with private aggregation among different discriminators to
ensure strong privacy guarantees. Compared to existing approaches, G-PATE
significantly improves the use of privacy budgets. In particular, we train a
student data generator with an ensemble of teacher discriminators and propose a
novel private gradient aggregation mechanism to ensure differential privacy on
all information that flows from teacher discriminators to the student
generator. In addition, with random projection and gradient discretization, the
proposed gradient aggregation mechanism is able to effectively deal with
high-dimensional gradient vectors. Theoretically, we prove that G-PATE ensures
differential privacy for the data generator. Empirically, we demonstrate the
superiority of G-PATE over prior work through extensive experiments. We show
that G-PATE is the first work being able to generate high-dimensional image

wide variety of decision-making scenarios. By observing the outcome of a
sufficient number of repeated trials, one would gradually learn the value and
usefulness of a particular policy or strategy. However, in a given environment,
the outcomes resulting from different trials are subject to chance influence
and variations. In learning about the usefulness of a given policy, significant
costs are involved in systematically undertaking the sequential trials;
therefore, in most learning episodes, one would wish to keep the cost within
bounds by adopting learning stopping rules. In this paper, we examine the
deployment of different stopping strategies in given learning environments
which vary from highly stringent for mission critical operations to highly
tolerant for non-mission critical operations, and emphasis is placed on the
former with particular application to aviation safety. In policy evaluation,
two sequential phases of learning are identified, and we describe the outcomes
variations using a probabilistic model, with closedform expressions obtained
for the key measures of performance. Decision rules that map the trial
observations to policy choices are also formulated. In addition, simulation
experiments are performed, which corroborate the validity of the theoretical

contained in the S66 data set. Our systems do not only represent equilibrium
structures, but also dimers with various relative orientations and
conformations at both shorter and longer distances. To train our D3-GP model,
we engineered two different vectorial representations of (supra-)molecular

terms: (a) a distance-resolved interaction energy histogram and (b) eigenvalues
of the interaction matrix ordered according to their decreasing absolute value.
We harness the prediction variance obtained from GP regression to select
optimal training sets in an automated fashion. The larger the variance, the
more information the corresponding data point may add to the training set. For
a given set of molecular systems, variance-based sampling can approximately
determine the smallest subset being subjected to reference calculations such
that all dispersion corrections for the remaining systems fall below a
predefined accuracy threshold. Our refined learning algorithm selects multiple
(instead of single) systems which can be subjected to reference calculations
simultaneously. We refer to the underlying selection strategy as batch-wise
variance-based sampling (BVS). BVS-guided active learning is an essential
component of our D3-GP workflow, which is implemented in a black-box fashion.
This approach leads overall to a self-improving model (D3-GP) that predicts
system-focused and GP-refined D3-type dispersion corrections for any given

paper, we address this issue by developing a multitaper spectral estimation
methodology that can be directly applied to multivariate spiking observations
in order to extract the evolutionary spectral density of the latent
non-stationary processes that drive spiking activity, based on point process
theory. We establish theoretical bounds on the bias-variance trade-off of the
proposed estimator. Finally, we compare the performance of our proposed
technique with existing methods using simulation studies and application to

for the gravitational memory effect. Nevertheless in curved spacetime, this
observable is plagued with various issues that need to be clarified before one
can extract the essential part that is related to the gravitational radiation.
In this paper we consider the Anti deSitter space as an example and analyze
this observable carefully. We show that by employing the Fermi Normal
Coordinates around the geodesic of one of the particles, one can elegantly
separate out the curvature contribution of the background spacetime to the
geodesic deviation from the contribution of the gravitational wave. The
gravitational wave memory obtained this way depends linearly and locally on the
retarded metric perturbation caused by the gravitational wave, and, remarkably,
it takes on exactly the same formula (1) as in the flat case. To determine the
memory, in addition to the standard tail contribution to the gravitational
radiation, one need to take into account of the contribution from the reflected
gravitational wave off the AdS boundary. For general curved spacetime, our
analysis suggests that the use of a certain coordinate system adapted to the
local geodesic (e.g. the Fermi normal coordinates system in the AdS case) would
allow one to dissect the geodesic deviation of test particles and extract the
relevant contribution to define the memory due to gravitational radiation.

policy challenge, and evaluating the efficacy of such policy efforts is crucial
for policy learning and adaptation. Deforestation in high-income nations can
contribute substantially to global forest loss, despite the presence of strong
institutions and high policy capacity. In Queensland, Australia, over 5 million
hectares of native forest has been lost since 1988. Successive regulatory
policies have aimed to reduce deforestation in Queensland, though debate exists
over their effect given the influence of other drivers of forest loss. Using a
hierarchical Bayesian statistical framework, we combine satellite imagery of
forest loss with macroeconomic, land tenure, biophysical and climatic variables
to collectively model deforestation for 50 local government areas (LGAs) across
Queensland. We apply the spatially explicit bent-cable regression model to
detect trend change that may signal a regulatory policy effect. We find that
annual % growth in GDP was the only clear driver of LGA-specific deforestation
after adjusting for other covariate effects. Our model shows strong evidence of
spatial contagion in deforestation across Queensland, and this effect is
influenced by the dominant land tenure type within each LGA. We find our model
exhibits a ""bend"" mostly between 2000 and 2007, consistent with expectations,
but the signal is not particularly strong due extreme variation in
deforestation trends between and within LGAs. Our results demonstrate that the
bent-cable model is a promising technique for detecting system changes in
response to policy interventions, but future work should be conducted at a
national scale to provide more data points, and incorporate more LGA-specific
data to improve model goodness-of-fit.

proposed Si to design a thin-film transistor (TFT) channel. Because the
suppression of unstable oxygen vacancies in InOx is crucial to maintaining the
semiconducting behavior, Si was selected as a strong oxygen binder that is
reasonably available for large production. In this review, we focus on the
overall properties observed in Si-incorporated amorphous InOx TFTs in terms of
bond-dissociation energy, Gibbs free energy, Si-concentration dependence of TFT
properties, carrier transport mechanism, and bias stress instability. In
comparing low and high doping densities, we found that the activation energy
and density of states decreased at a high Si concentration in InOx TFTs,
implying that the trap density was reduced. As a result, stable operation under
bias stresses could be realized. Furthermore, the inverse Meyer-Neldel rule was
observed in the highly Si-doped InOx TFT, indicating reasonable ohmic contact.
Based on our fundamental knowledge of the Si-doped InOx film, we developed a
high-mobility bilayer TFT with a homogeneous stacked channel that was different
from a TFT with an etch stop layer structure. The TFT showed remarkably stable
operation. With simple element components based on InOx, it is possible to
systematically discuss vacancy engineering in terms of conduction properties.

usually driven out of equilibrium by an external time-dependent parameter which
follows a particular {\it protocol}. One needs to perform several iterations of
the same experiment in order to find statistically relevant results. Since the
systems are microscopic, fluctuations dominate. Studying the convergence of
relevant thermodynamics quantities with number of realizations is also
important as it gives a rough estimate of number of iterations one needs to
perform. In each iteration the protocol follows a predetermined {\it
identical/fixed} form. However, the protocol itself may be prone to
fluctuations. In this work we are interested in looking at a simple
non-equilibrium system namely a Brownian particle trapped in a harmonic
potential. The center of the trap is then dragged according to a protocol. We
however lift the condition of fixed protocol. In our case the protocol in each
realization is different. We consider one of the parameters of the protocol as
a random variable, chosen from some known distribution. We study the systems
analytically as well as numerically. We specifically study the convergence of
the average work and free energy difference with number of realizations.
Interestingly, in several cases, randomness in the protocol does not seem to
affect the convergence when compared to fixed protocol results. We study
symmetry functions. A Brownian particle in a double well potential is also
studied numerically. We believe that our results can be experimentally
verified.

respect to the universal statistical behaviors of natural language. Statistical
mechanical analyses have revealed that natural language text is characterized
by scaling properties, which quantify the global structure in the vocabulary
population and the long memory of a text. We study whether five scaling
properties (given by Zipf's law, Heaps' law, Ebeling's method, Taylor's law,
and long-range correlation analysis) can serve for evaluation of computational
models. Specifically, we test $n$-gram language models, a probabilistic
context-free grammar (PCFG), language models based on Simon/Pitman-Yor
processes, neural language models, and generative adversarial networks (GANs)
for text generation. Our analysis reveals that language models based on
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with a gating mechanism (i.e., long short-term
memory, LSTM; a gated recurrent unit, GRU; and quasi-recurrent neural networks,
QRNNs) are the only computational models that can reproduce the long memory

proposed model-based evaluation methods, we find that the exponent of Taylor's

was to build a practical NLP based AI pipeline for document understanding which
will help us better understand the computation patterns and requirements of
modern computing systems. While building such a prototype, an early use case
came to us thanks to the 2017 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on
Microarchitecture (MICRO-50) Program Co-chairs, Drs. Hillery Hunter and Jaime
Moreno. They asked us if we can perform some data-driven analysis of the past
50 years of MICRO papers and show some interesting historical perspectives on
MICRO's 50 years of publication. We learned two important lessons from that
experience: (1) building an AI solution to truly understand unstructured data
is hard in spite of the many claimed successes in natural language
understanding; and (2) providing a data-driven perspective on computer
architecture research is a very interesting and fun project. Recently we
decided to conduct a more thorough study based on all past papers of
International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) from 1973 to 2018,
which resulted this article. We recognize that we have just scratched the
surface of natural language understanding of unstructured data, and there are
many more aspects that we can improve. But even with our current study, we felt
there were enough interesting findings that may be worthwhile to share with the
community. Hence we decided to write this article to summarize our findings so
far based only on ISCA publications. Our hope is to generate further interests
from the community in this topic, and we welcome collaboration from the

research and of the challenges of NLP-based AI solutions.

calibration has been developed based on kernel mean embedding to estimate the

machine learning models with simulation models by a series of kernel mean
embeddings to address these difficulties. The proposed framework enables us to

braid PM-monoids. The PM-monoids is obtained in the context of the
compactification of projective linear group defined by Mutsumi Saito. The
structure of PM-monoids is described in terms of matched pairs. We can define
braid PM-monoid using a presentation for the PM-monoid. As main results, we
show that braid PM-monoids are described by geometric braids and we find a
solution to the word problem for the braid PM-monoids.

implements and learns general purpose set-equivariant functions. Such a
function f maps a set of entities x = {x1, . . . , xn} from one domain to a set
of same cardinality y = f (x) = {y1, . . . , yn} in another domain regardless
of the ordering of the entities. The architecture is based on a gated recurrent
network which is iteratively applied to all entities individually and at the
same time syncs with the progression of the whole population. In reminiscence
to this pattern, which can be frequently observed in nature, we call our
approach SWARM mapping. Set-equivariant and generally permutation invariant
functions are important building blocks for many state of the art machine
learning approaches. Even in applications where the permutation invariance is
not of primary interest, as to be seen in the recent success of attention based
transformer models (Vaswani et. al. 2017). Accordingly, we demonstrate the
power and usefulness of SWARM mappings in different applications. We compare
the performance of our approach with another recently proposed set-equivariant
function, the Set Transformer (Lee et.al. 2018) and we demonstrate that models
solely based on SWARM layers gives state of the art results.

recently referred to as the ''Higgs mode'' as it is a condensed-matter analogue
of a Higgs boson in particle physics. Higgs mode is a scalar excitation of the
order parameter, distinct from charge or spin fluctuations, and thus does not
couple to electromagnetic fields linearly. This is why the Higgs mode in
superconductors has evaded experimental observations over a half century after
the initial theoretical prediction, except for a charge-density-wave coexisting

techniques, however, it has become possible to study the Higgs mode through the
nonlinear light-Higgs coupling. In this review, we overview recent progresses

firstly locates the relevance parts quickly from the whole document and then
matches these parts with the query carefully to obtain the final label.
Firstly, we select relevant sentences from the long documents by a coarse and
efficient matching model. Secondly, we generate a relevance score by a more
sophisticated matching model based on the sentence selected. The whole model is
trained jointly with reinforcement learning in a pairwise manner by maximizing
the expected score gaps between positive and negative examples. Experimental

Electron Multiplier (GEM) foil provides a possibility of continuous readout for
TPC, which can suppress IBF efficiently while keeping stable gain. A prototype
chamber including two layers of GEM foils and anode wires has been built to
combine both advantages from GEM and anode wire. Using Garfield++ and the
finite element analysis (FEA) method, simulations of the transmission processes
of electrons and ions are performed and results on absorption ratio of ions,
gain and IBF ratio are obtained. The optimized parameters from simulation are
then applied to the prototype chamber to test the IBF and other performances.
Both GEM foils are run at low voltage (255V), while most of the gain is
provided by the anode wire. The measurement shows that the IBF ratio can be
suppressed to ~0.58% with double-layer GEM foils (staggered) at an effective

jacobian of moderately large rank $4g+2$, where $g$ is the genus; by
Silverman's specialization theorem, this yields hyperelliptic curves over

observe the largest lower order term that does not average to zero is on
average negative, a bias first noted by S.J. Miller in the elliptic curve case.
We prove this bias for a number of families of hyperelliptic curves.

For Toeplitz operators $T$ with piecewise continuous symbols, we suggest a
further spectral classification determined by propagation properties of the

It turns out that the spectrum is naturally partitioned into three disjoint
subsets: thick, thin and mixed spectra. On the thick spectrum, the propagation
properties are modeled by the continuous part of the symbol, whereas on the
thin spectrum, the model operator is determined by the jumps of the symbol. On
the mixed spectrum, these two types of the asymptotic evolution of $\exp(-iTt)
f$ coexist. This classification is justified in the framework of scattering
theory. We prove the existence of wave operators that relate the model
operators with the Toeplitz operator $T$. The ranges of these wave operators

and superconductivity of FeTe thin films. We found that the films with the
highest Tc showed non-saturating superfluid density and a strong magnetic
hysteresis distinct from that in a homogeneous superconductor. Such hysteresis
can be well explained by a two-level critical state model and suggested the
importance of granularity to superconductivity in this compound.

ingredients for the experimental program at the next generation of lepton
accelerators. In the context of the Hadronic Physics program at the Jefferson
Laboratory (JLab), positron beams are complementary, even essential, tools for
a precise understanding of the electromagnetic structure of the nucleon, in
both the elastic and the deep-inelastic regimes. For instance, elastic
scattering of (un)polarized electrons and positrons off the nucleon allows for
a model independent determination of the electromagnetic form factors of the
nucleon. Also, the deeply virtual Compton scattering of (un)polarized electrons
and positrons allows us to separate unambiguously the different contributions
to the cross section of the lepto-production of photons, enabling an accurate
determination of the nucleon Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), and
providing an access to its Gravitational Form Factors. Furthermore, positron
beams offer the possibility of alternative tests of the Standard Model through
the search of a dark photon or the precise measurement of electroweak
couplings. This letter proposes to develop an experimental positron program at
JLab to perform unique high impact measurements with respect to the two-photon
exchange problem, the determination of the proton and the neutron GPDs, and the
search for the $A^{\prime}$ dark photon.

missing links in single-layer (simplex) networks. The proposed link prediction
methods compute a similarity measure between unconnected node pairs based on
the observed structure of the network. However, extension of notion of
similarity to multiplex networks is a two-fold challenge. The layers of
real-world multiplex networks do not have the same organization yet are not of
totally different organizations. So, it should be determined that how similar
are the layers of a multiplex network. On the other hand, it is needed to be
known that how similar layers can contribute in link prediction task on a
target layer with missing links. Eigenvectors are known to well reflect the
structural features of networks. Therefore, two layers of a multiplex network
are similar w.r.t. structural features if they share similar eigenvectors.
Experiments show that layers of real-world multiplex networks are similar
w.r.t. structural features and the value of similarity is far beyond their
randomized counterparts. Furthermore, it is shown that missing links are highly
predictable if their addition or removal do not significantly change the
network structural features. Otherwise, if the change is significant a similar
copy of structural features may come to help. Based on this concept, Layer
Reconstruction Method (LRM) finds the best reconstruction of the observed
structure of the target layer with structural features of other similar layers.
Experiments on real multiplex networks from different disciplines show that
this method benefits from information redundancy in the networks and helps the
performance of link prediction to stay robust even under high fraction of
missing links.

where this scaling can be cast in terms of the universal equilibrium critical
exponents and can thus be understood within the Kibble-Zurek framework. When
the electron hopping decays more slowly in space than pairing, it dominates the
equilibrium scaling. Surprisingly, in this regime the dynamical critical
behaviour arises only from paring and, thus, exhibits anomalous dynamical
universality unrelated to equilibrium scaling. The discrepancy from the
expected Kibble-Zurek scenario can be traced back to the presence of multiple
universal terms in the equilibrium scaling functions of long-range interacting
systems close to a second order critical point.

this paper presents an enhanced regularized K-nearest neighbor based twin

Weight is given to each sample by considering the distance from its nearest
neighbors. This further reduces the effect of noise and outliers on the output
model. (2) An extra stabilizer term was added to each objective function. As a
result, the learning rules of the proposed method are stable. (3) To reduce the

is one of the poorly understood aspects of the shock acceleration theory. Here
we adopt a phenomenological approach to study the particle escape and its
impact on the gamma-ray spectrum resulting from hadronic collisions both inside
and outside of a middle-aged SNR. Under the assumption that in the spatial
region immediately outside of the remnant the diffusion coefficient is
suppressed with respect to the average Galactic one, we show that a significant
fraction of particles are still located inside the SNR long time after their
nominal release from the acceleration region. This fact results into a
gamma-ray spectrum that resembles a broken power law, similar to those observed
in several middle-aged SNRs. Above the break, the spectral steepening is
determined by the diffusion coefficient outside of the SNR and by the time
dependence of maximum energy. Consequently, the comparison between the model
prediction and actual data will contribute to determining these two quantities,
the former being particularly relevant within the predictions of the gamma-ray
emission from the halo of escaping particles around SNRs which could be
detected with future Cherenkov telescope facilities. We also calculate the
spectrum of run-away particles injected into the Galaxy by an individual
remnant. Assuming that the acceleration stops before the SNR enters the
snowplow phase, we show that the released spectrum can be a featureless power
law only if the accelerated spectrum has a slope alpha > 4.

spend it wisely, in order to return as better a point as possible. In this
paper, we propose a Bayesian optimization approach in this evaluation-limited
scenario. Our approach is based on constraining searching directions so as to
dedicate the model capability to the most promising area. It could be viewed as
a combination of local and global searching policies, which aims at reducing
inefficient exploration in the local searching areas, thus making a searching
policy more efficient. Experimental studies are conducted on both synthetic and
real-world applications. The results demonstrate the superior performance of
our newly proposed approach in searching for the optimum within a prescribed
evaluation budget.

of carbon star envelopes covering a wide range of mass loss rates to
investigate the potential role that these molecules could play in the formation
of dust in the surroundings of the central AGB star. Methods: We surveyed a
sample of 25 carbon-rich AGB stars in the $\lambda$ 2 mm band, using the IRAM
30 m telescope. We performed excitation and radiative transfer calculations
based on the LVG method to model the observed lines of the molecules and to
derive their fractional abundances in the observed CSEs. Results: We detected
CS in all 25 CSEs, SiO in 24 of them, and SiS in 17 sources. We found that CS
and SiS have similar abundances in carbon star envelopes, while SiO is present
with a lower abundance. We also found a strong correlation in which the denser
the envelope, the less abundant are CS and SiO. The trend is however only
tentatively seen for SiS in the range of high mass loss rates. Furthermore, we
found a relation in which the integrated flux of the MgS dust feature at 30 um
increases as the fractional abundance of CS decreases. Conclusions: The decline
in the fractional abundance of CS with increasing density could be due to
gas-phase chemistry in the inner envelope or to adsorption onto dust grains.
The latter possibility is favored by a correlation between the CS fractional
abundance and the 30 um feature, which suggests that CS is efficiently
incorporated onto MgS dust around C-rich AGB stars. In the case of SiO, the
observed abundance depletion with increasing density is most likely caused by
an efficient incorporation onto dust grains. We conclude that CS, SiO (very
likely), and SiS (tentatively) are good candidates to act as gas-phase
precursors of dust in C-rich AGB envelopes.

spatial reconstruction, with total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta time
discretization. The main idea of the hybrid HWENO scheme is that we first use a
shock-detection technique to identify the troubled cell, then, if the cell is
identified as a troubled cell, we would modify the first order moment in the
troubled cell and employ HWENO reconstruction in spatial discretization;
otherwise, we directly use high order linear reconstruction. Unlike other HWENO
schemes, we borrow the thought of limiter for discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
method to control the spurious oscillations, after this procedure, the scheme
would avoid the oscillations by using HWENO reconstruction nearby
discontinuities and have higher efficiency for using linear approximation
straightforwardly in the smooth regions. In addition, the hybrid HWENO scheme
still keeps the compactness. A collection of benchmark numerical tests for one
and two dimensional cases are performed to demonstrate the numerical accuracy,
high resolution and robustness of the proposed scheme.

include the widely used Boolean networks and their generalizations. The
potential interventions can be represented by a set of nodes and edges that can
be manipulated to produce a desired effect on the system. We use a class of
regulatory rules called nested canalizing functions that frequently appear in
published models and were inspired by the concept of canalization in
evolutionary biology. In this paper, we provide a polynomial normal form based
on the canalizing properties of regulatory functions. Using this polynomial
normal form, we give a set of formulas for counting the maximum number of
transitions that will change in the state space upon an edge deletion in the
wiring diagram. These formulas rely on the canalizing structure of the target
function since the number of changed transitions depends on the canalizing
layer that includes the input to be deleted. We also present computations on
random networks to compare the exact number of changes with the upper bounds
provided by our formulas. Finally, we provide statistics on the sharpness of
these upper bounds in random networks.

  atop Public Blockchain",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ride-sharing is a service that enables drivers to share their trips with
other riders, contributing to appealing benefits of shared travel costs.
However, the majority of existing platforms rely on a central third party,
which make them subject to a single point of failure and privacy disclosure
issues. Moreover, they are vulnerable to DDoS and Sybil attacks due to
malicious users involvement. Besides, high fees should be paid to the service
provider. In this paper, we propose a decentralized ride-sharing service based
on public Blockchain, named B-Ride. Both riders and drivers can find rides
match while preserving their trip data, including pick-up/drop-off location,
and departure/arrival date. However, under the anonymity of the public
blockchain, a malicious user may submit multiple ride requests or offers, while
not committing to any of them, to discover better offer or to make the system
unreliable. B-Ride solves this problem by introducing a time-locked deposit
protocol for a ride-sharing by leveraging smart contract and zero-knowledge set
membership proof. In a nutshell, both a driver and a rider have to show their
commitment by sending a deposit to the blockchain. Later, a driver has to prove
to the blockchain on the agreed departure time that he has arrived at the
pick-up location. To preserve rider/driver location privacy by hiding the exact
pick-up location, the proof is done using zero-knowledge set membership
protocol. Moreover, to ensure a fair payment, a pay-as-you-drive methodology is
introduced based on the elapsed distance of the driver and the rider. Also, we
introduce a reputation-based trust model to rate drivers based on their past
trips to allow riders to select them based on their history on the system.
Finally, we implement B-Ride in a test net of Ethereum. The experiment results
show the applicability of our protocol atop the existing real-world blockchain.

coupling, there is a critical connectivity above which the system is guaranteed
to converge to the in-phase synchronous state, for almost all initial
conditions. But the precise value of this critical connectivity remains
unknown. In 2018, Ling, Xu, and Bandeira proved that if each oscillator is
coupled to at least 79.29 percent of all the others, global synchrony is
ensured. In 2019, Lu and Steinerberger improved this bound to 78.89 percent.
Here, by focusing on circulant networks, we find clues that the critical
connectivity may be exactly 75 percent. Our methods yield a slight improvement
on the best known lower bound on the critical connectivity, from $68.18\%$ to
$68.28\%$. We also consider the opposite end of the connectivity spectrum,
where the networks are sparse rather than dense. In this regime, we ask how few
edges one needs to add to a ring of $n$ oscillators to turn it into a globally
synchronizing network. We prove a partial result: all the twisted states in a
ring of size $n=2^m$ can be destabilized by adding just $\mathcal{O}(n \log_2
n)$ edges. To finish the proof, one also needs to rule out all other candidate
attractors. We have done this for $n=8$ with computational algebraic geometry,
but the problem remains open for larger $n$. Thus, even for systems as simple
as Kuramoto oscillators, much remains to be learned about dense networks that
do not globally synchronize and sparse ones that do.

of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, septicemia, and meningitis.
Reconstituted powdered infant formulae (PIF) is the most common vehicle of
infection. Plate count methods do not provide direct information on the
physiological status of cells. Flow cytometry (FC) has been used to gain
insights into the physiological states of C. sakazakii after heat treatments,
and to compare FC results with plate counts. The percentage of compromised
cells increased as the percentage of live cells increased after the 100 C
treatment. However, the number of compromised cells after 60 or 65 C treatments
decreased as the percentage of live cells increased, showing that both mild
temperatures would not be completely effective eliminating all bacteria but
compromising their membranes, and showing that mild heat treatments are not
enough to guarantee the safety of PIF. FC was capable to detect C. sakazakii
compromised cells that cannot be detected with classical plate count methods,
thus it could be used to decreasing the risk of pathogenic viable but
non-culturable cells to be in the ingested food. Linear regression analysis
showed good correlations between plate count results vs FC results.

  Mechanics: theory and experiment. This is the accepted version with
  additional figures and clarifications based on referees' reports",,"10.1088/1742-5468/ab811f",,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A particle entering a scattering and absorbing medium executes a random walk
through a sequence of scattering events. The particle ultimately achieves
first-passage, leaving the medium or it is absorbed. The Kubelka-Munk model
describes a flux of particles moving perpendicular to the surface of a
plane-parallel medium. The particle path alternates between the positive
direction into the medium and the negative direction back towards the surface.
Backscattering events from the positive to the negative direction occur at
local maxima or peaks, while backscattering from the negative to the positive
direction occur at local minima or valleys. The probability of a particle
avoiding absorption as it follows its path decreases exponentially with the
path-length \(\lambda\). The reflectance of a semi-infinite slab is therefore
the Laplace transform of the distribution of path-length that ends with a
first-passage out of the medium. In the case of a constant scattering rate the
random walk is a Poisson process. We verify our results with two iterative
calculations, one using the properties of iterated convolution with a symmetric
kernel and the other via direct calculation with an exponential step-length
distribution.
  We present a novel demonstration, based on fluctuation theory of sums of
random variables, that the first-passage probability as a function of the
number of peaks in the alternating path is a step-length distribution-free
combinatoric expression. Counting paths with backscattering on the real
half-line results in the same Catalan number coefficients as Dyck paths on the
whole numbers. Including a separate forward-scattering Poisson process results
in an expression related to counting Motzkin paths. We therefore connect walks
on the real line to discrete path combinatorics.

Psuedo-inverse correlation in the connectivity. This is associated with the
emergence of spontaneous activity that intermittently exhibits neural patterns
corresponding to embedded memories. Stablization of memories is achieved by a
distinct bifurcation from the spontaneous activity under the application of
each input.

  Estimating Interpersonal Eye Gaze from Conventional Video",,,,,"cs.CV cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Despite a revolution in the pervasiveness of video cameras in our daily
lives, one of the most meaningful forms of nonverbal affective communication,
interpersonal eye gaze, i.e. eye gaze relative to a conversation partner, is
not available from common video. We introduce the Interpersonal-Calibrating
Eye-gaze Encoder (ICE), which automatically extracts interpersonal gaze from
video recordings without specialized hardware and without prior knowledge of
participant locations. Leveraging the intuition that individuals spend a large
portion of a conversation looking at each other enables the ICE dynamic
clustering algorithm to extract interpersonal gaze. We validate ICE in both
video chat using an objective metric with an infrared gaze tracker (F1=0.846,
N=8), as well as in face-to-face communication with expert-rated evaluations of
eye contact (r= 0.37, N=170). We then use ICE to analyze behavior in two
different, yet important affective communication domains: interrogation-based
deception detection, and communication skill assessment in speed dating. We
find that honest witnesses break interpersonal gaze contact and look down more
often than deceptive witnesses when answering questions (p=0.004, d=0.79). In
predicting expert communication skill ratings in speed dating videos, we
demonstrate that interpersonal gaze alone has more predictive power than facial
expressions.

  Rayleigh-Benard convection","22 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dynamics of inertial particles in Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection, where
both particles and fluid exhibit thermal expansion, is studied using direct
numerical simulations (DNS). We consider the effect of particles with a thermal
expansion coefficient larger than that of the fluid, causing particles to
become lighter than the fluid near the hot bottom plate and heavier than the
fluid near the cold top plate. Because of the opposite directions of the net
Archimedes' force on particles and fluid, particles deposited at the plate now
experience a relative force towards the bulk. The characteristic time for this
motion towards the bulk to happen, quantified as the time particles spend
inside the thermal boundary layers (BLs) at the plates, is shown to depend on
the thermal response time, $\tau_T$, and the thermal expansion coefficient of
particles relative to that of the fluid, $K = \alpha_p / \alpha_f$. In
particular, the residence time is constant for small thermal response times,
$\tau_T \lesssim 1$, and increasing with $\tau_T$ for larger thermal response
times, $\tau_T \gtrsim 1$. Also, the thermal BL residence time is increasing
with decreasing $K$. A one-dimensional (1D) model is developed, where particles
experience thermal inertia and their motion is purely dependent on the buoyancy
force. Although the values do not match one-to-one, this highly simplified 1D
model does predict a regime of a constant thermal BL residence time for smaller
thermal response times and a regime of increasing residence time with $\tau_T$
for larger response times, thus explaining the trends in the DNS data well.

physical quantities such as proper times and Doppler shifts can be obtained

there are numerous experimental results that agree with the predictions of STR.
It is explained why they are accurate despite the inconsistencies. The Lorentz
transformation (LT), unless subject to the postulates of STR, may be a useful
method to approach physics problems. As an example to show the usefulness of
LT, the problem of the generalized Sagnac effect is solved by utilizing it.

inference in situations in which the likelihood function is either

rejection algorithm have improved the computational efficiency of the procedure
and broadened its applicability. The ABC-Population Monte Carlo (ABC-PMC)
approach of Beaumont et al. (2009) has become a popular choice for approximate
sampling from the posterior. ABC-PMC is a sequential sampler with an
iteratively decreasing value of the tolerance, which specifies how close the
simulated data need to be to the real data for acceptance. We propose a method
for adaptively selecting a sequence of tolerances that improves the
computational efficiency of the algorithm over other common techniques. In
addition we define a stopping rule as a by-product of the adaptation procedure,
which assists in automating termination of sampling. The proposed automatic
ABC-PMC algorithm can be easily implemented and we present several examples
demonstrating its benefits in terms of computational efficiency.

ride-hailing, are transforming urban mobility but have been shown to reinforce
socioeconomic inequities. Spatiotemporal demand prediction models for these new
mobility regimes must therefore consider fairness as a first-class design
requirement. We present FairST, a fairness-aware model for predicting demand
for new mobility systems. Our approach utilizes 1D, 2D and 3D convolutions to
integrate various urban features and learn the spatial-temporal dynamics of a
mobility system, but we include fairness metrics as a form of regularization to
make the predictions more equitable across demographic groups. We propose two
novel spatiotemporal fairness metrics, a region-based fairness gap (RFG) and an
individual-based fairness gap (IFG). Both quantify equity in a spatiotemporal
context, but vary by whether demographics are labeled at the region level (RFG)
or whether population distribution information is available (IFG). Experimental
results on real bike share and ride share datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model: FairST not only reduces the fairness gap
by more than 80%, but can surprisingly achieve better accuracy than
state-of-the-art yet fairness-oblivious methods including LSTMs, ConvLSTMs, and
3D CNN.
