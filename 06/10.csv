nonlinear dynamical systems as it provides coordinate transformations to
globally linearize the dynamics. While recent deep learning approaches have
been useful in extracting the Koopman operator from a data-driven perspective,
several challenges remain. In this work, we formalize the problem of learning
the continuous-time Koopman operator with deep neural networks in a
measure-theoretic framework. Our approach induces two types of models:
differential and recurrent form, the choice of which depends on the
availability of the governing equations and data. We then enforce a structural
parameterization that renders the realization of the Koopman operator provably
stable. A new autoencoder architecture is constructed, such that only the
residual of the dynamic mode decomposition is learned. Finally, we employ
mean-field variational inference (MFVI) on the aforementioned framework in a
hierarchical Bayesian setting to quantify uncertainties in the characterization
and prediction of the dynamics of observables. The framework is evaluated on a
simple polynomial system, the Duffing oscillator, and an unstable cylinder wake
flow with noisy measurements.

systematical uncertainties, we first extract the $M1$ form factor $\hat{V}(0)$
of the process $J/\psi\to\gamma\eta_{c}$ and get the result
$\hat{V}(0)=1.933(41)$ in the continuum limit, which gives the partial width
$\Gamma(J/\psi\to\gamma\eta_{c})=2.47(11)$ keV. These results are in agreement
with that of previous lattice studies. As for the pseudoscalar glueball
$G_{0^{-+}}$, its mass is derived to be $2.395(14)$ GeV, and the form factor
$\hat{V}(0)$ of the process $J/\psi\to\gamma G_{0^{-+}}$ is determined to be
$\hat{V}(0)=0.0246(43)$ after continuum extrapolation. Finally, the production
rate of the pseudoscalar glueball is predicted to be $2.31(90)\times10^{-4}$,
which is much smaller than that of conventional light $q\bar{q}$ $\eta$ states.
After the subtraction of the phase space factor, the couplings of $J/\psi
X\gamma$ are similar where $X$ stands for $\eta$ states and the pseudoscalar
glueball. Possibly, the $U_{A}(1)$ anomaly plays an important role for the
large couplings of gluons to the flavor singlet $\eta$ states in $J/\psi$

uses smoothing/regularization to trade training (TE) and generalization error
(GE). Driving TE to zero by increasing fitting degrees of freedom (dof) is
expected to increase GE. However modern big-data approaches, including deep
nets, seem to over-parametrize and send TE to zero (data interpolation) without
impacting GE. Overparametrization has the benefit that global minima of the
empirical loss function proliferate and become easier to find. These phenomena
have drawn theoretical attention. Regression and classification algorithms have
been shown that interpolate data but also generalize optimally. An interesting
related phenomenon has been noted: the existence of non-monotonic risk curves,
with a peak in GE with increasing dof. It was suggested that this peak
separates a classical regime from a modern regime where over-parametrization
improves performance. Similar over-fitting peaks were reported previously
(statistical physics approach to learning) and attributed to increased fitting
model flexibility. We introduce a generative and fitting model pair
(""Misparametrized Sparse Regression"" or MiSpaR) and show that the overfitting
peak can be dissociated from the point at which the fitting function gains
enough dof's to match the data generative model and thus provides good
generalization. This complicates the interpretation of overfitting peaks as
separating a ""classical"" from a ""modern"" regime. Data interpolation itself
cannot guarantee good generalization: we need to study the interpolation with
different penalty terms. We present analytical formulae for GE curves for
MiSpaR with $l_2$ and $l_1$ penalties, in the interpolating limit
$\lambda\rightarrow 0$.These risk curves exhibit important differences and help
elucidate the underlying phenomena.

Indeed, in this case, the first eigenfunction is constant, and looking at the
level sets of $u$ amounts to looking at the nodal sets $\{u-a=0\}$, where $a$
is a real constant. In the first part of the paper, we prove that the Extended
Courant property is false for the subequilateral triangle and for regular

prove that there exists a Neumann eigenfunction $u_k$ of the $N$-gon, with

$(N+1)$ connected components. In the second part, we prove that there exists a

arbitrarily close to the flat metric (resp. round metric), and an eigenfunction
$u$ of the associated Laplace-Beltrami operator, such that the set $\{u \not =

Courant property is false for these closed surfaces. These results are strongly
motivated by a recent paper by Buhovsky, Logunov and Sodin. As for the positive
direction, in Appendix~B, we prove that the Extended Courant property is true
for the isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

the presence of AQECCs in systems satisfying ETH. In this paper, we explore the

discuss a generalization that all chaotic theories contain error correcting

When combined with the existing AdS/CFT error correction story, this shows that
black holes are enormously robust against erasure errors.

probabilities arose thermodynamically. A chief concern is the detection of
primordial `quantum nonequilibrium', since this is observably distinct from
textbook quantum physics. Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 are adaptations of references
[1,2,3], and [4] respectively.
  Chapter 2 proposes (information) entropy conservation as a minimal
requirement for a theory to feature classical-style thermodynamic relaxation.
The resulting structure is dubbed `the iRelax framework'. Both classical
mechanics and de Broglie-Bohm quantum theory are shown to be special cases.
Indications for a possible extension or unification of de Broglie-Bohm theory
are briefly highlighted.
  Chapter 3 examines ways in which quantum relaxation may be prevented. The
method of the drift-field is introduced. A systematic treatment of nodes is
given. A category of quantum states is found for which relaxation is
significantly impeded, and may not complete at all.
  Chapters 4 and 5 consider the possibility that primordial quantum
nonequilibrium may be conserved in the statistics of a species of relic
cosmological particle. Necessary factors for this to be the case are discussed
and illustrative scenarios are given both in terms of nonequilibrium particles
created by inflaton decay, as well as relic vacuum modes for species that
decoupled close to the Planck temperature. The search for so-called
`smoking-gun' spectral lines created by dark matter decay or annihilation is
argued to be a particularly promising setting for the detection of quantum
nonequilibrium. Unintuitive spectral effects relating to the contextuality of
quantum measurements are described. If such a suspected source of quantum
nonequilibrium were found, its subjection to a specifically quantum mechanical
test would confirm or deny the presence of the quantum nonequilibrium
conclusively.

which detects bodies of the Solar System in astronomical images and measures
their astrometry and photometry. The ssos pipeline is versatile, allowing for
application to all kinds of observatory imaging products. The sole principle
requirement is that the images observe overlapping areas of the sky within a
reasonable time range. Both known and unknown Solar System objects are

dark energy and dark matter. Being coupled to ordinary matter, these fields
modify the masses and/or charges of the elementary particles, thereby violating
the Weak Equivalence Principle. Thus, values of fundamental constants such as
the proton-to-electron mass ratio, mu, and/or the fine structure constant,
alpha, measured in different environment conditions can be used as probes for
this coupling. Here we perform differential measurements of F = mu*alpha^2 to
test a non-standard coupling in the Magellanic Clouds - dwarf galaxies where
the overall mass budget is dominated by dark matter. The analysis is based on
[CI] and CO lines observed with the Herschel Space Observatory. Since these
lines have different sensitivities to changes in mu and alpha, the combined
alpha and mu variations can be evaluated through the radial velocity offsets,
Delta V, between the CO and [CI] lines. Averaging over nine positions in the
Magellanic Clouds, we obtain <Delta V> = -0.02+/-0.07 km/s, leading to |Delta
F/F| < 2*10^-7 (1sigma), where Delta F/F = (F_obs-F_lab)/F_lab}. However, for
one position observed with five times higher spectral resolution we find Delta
V = -0.05+/-0.02 km/s, resulting in Delta F/F = (-1.7+/-0.7)*10^-7. Whether
this offset is due to changes in the fundamental constants, due to chemical
segregation in the emitting gas or merely due to Doppler noise requires further
investigations.

centre of the low-mass galaxy cluster, IIZw108 ($\sigma \sim575$ km/s). JO206
is characterised by a long tail ($\geq$90 kpc) of ionised gas stripped away by
ram-pressure. We find a similarly long HI tail in the same direction as the
ionised gas tail and measure a total HI mass of $3.2 \times 10^{9}$
M$_{\odot}$. This is about half the expected HI mass given the stellar mass and
surface density of JO206. A total of $1.8 \times 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$ (60%) of
the detected HI is in the gas stripped tail. An analysis of the star formation
rate shows that the galaxy is forming more stars compared to galaxies with the
same stellar and HI mass. On average we find a HI gas depletion time of
$\sim$0.5 Gyr which is about four times shorter than that of ""normal"" spiral
galaxies. We performed a spatially resolved analysis of the relation between
star formation rate density and gas density in the disc and tail of the galaxy
at the resolution of our HI data. The star formation efficiency of the disc is
about 10 times higher than that of the tail at fixed HI surface densities. Both
the inner and outer parts of JO206 show an enhanced star formation compared to
regions of similar HI surface density in field galaxies. The enhanced star
formation is due to ram-pressure stripping during the galaxy's first infall
into the cluster.

these studies have predominately focused on brain functional connectivity (i.e.
Fisher z-score), which requires manual processing steps for feature extraction
from fMRI images. Deep learning approaches (i.e., Convolutional Neural
Networks) have achieved remarkable success on learning directly from image
data, yet have not been applied on fetal fMRI for understanding fetal
neurodevelopment. Here, we bridge this gap by applying a novel application of
deep 3D CNN to fetal blood oxygen-level dependence (BOLD) resting-state fMRI
data. Specifically, we test a supervised CNN framework as a data-driven
approach to isolate variation in fMRI signals that relate to younger v.s. older
fetal age groups. Based on the learned CNN, we further perform sensitivity
analysis to identify brain regions in which changes in BOLD signal are strongly
associated with fetal brain age. The findings demonstrate that deep CNNs are a
promising approach for identifying spontaneous functional patterns in fetal
brain activity that discriminate age groups. Further, we discovered that
regions that most strongly differentiate groups are largely bilateral, share
similar distribution in older and younger age groups, and are areas of
heightened metabolic activity in early human development.

several features of the electronic structure, such as strong and dynamic
correlation, and localized vs. delocalized bonding. We here present a
fully-quantum embedded version of i-FCIQMC , which we apply to calculate the
bond dissociation energy of an ionic bond (LiH) and a covalent bond (HF)
physisorbed to a benzene molecule. The embedding is performed using a
recently-developed Huzinaga projection operator approach, which affords good
synergy with i-FCIQMC by minimizing the number of orbitals in the calculation.
We find that, without embedding, i-FCIQMC struggles to converge these
calculations due to their substantial system sizes and a lack of error
cancellation between reactants and products. With embedding, the i-FCIQMC
calculation converges straightforwardly to CCSD(T) benchmarks. Our results
suggest that embedded i-FCIQMC will be able treat system sizes well beyond our

distance provides a more desirable optimisation space. We thus provide a stable
solution to the EMMs that is both robust to initialisations and reaches a
superior optimum by adaptively optimising along a manifold of an approximate
Wasserstein distance. To this end, we first provide a unifying account of
computable and identifiable EMMs, which serves as a basis to rigorously address
the underpinning optimisation problem. Due to a probability constraint, solving
this problem is extremely cumbersome and unstable, especially under the
Wasserstein distance. To relieve this issue, we introduce an efficient
optimisation method on a statistical manifold defined under an approximate
Wasserstein distance, which allows for explicit metrics and computable
operations, thus significantly stabilising and improving the EMM estimation. We
further propose an adaptive method to accelerate the convergence. Experimental
results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed EMM solver.

necessary to impose a radiation condition that allows for capillary waves
upstream, but disallows those corresponding to gravity. However, this radiation
condition is not known a priori and consequently, the computation of accurate
numerical solutions to the steady-state problem remains problematic. Although
the physical model might be modified (e.g. with viscosity), recovery of the
original problem is not always possible.
  In this work, we discuss the above radiation problem, and show how, in the
low-speed limit, the steady gravity-capillary waves can be resolved using a
Sommerfeld-type boundary condition applied to an asymptotically reduced set of
water-wave equations. These results allow us to validate the specialized
classes of low-speed waves theoretically predicted by Trinh & Chapman (2013)

The issues of numerically solving the full set of gravity-capillary equations

bridge deck is a major source of errors in delamination detection through
thermography. This type of external noise poses a significant challenge for
conventional quantitative methods such as global thresholding and k-means
clustering. An iterative top-down approach is proposed for delamination
segmentation based on grayscale morphological reconstruction. A weight-decay
function was used to regularize the reconstruction for regional maxima
extraction. The mean and coefficient of variation of temperature gradient
estimated from delamination boundaries were used for discrimination. The
proposed approach was tested on a lab experiment and an in-service bridge deck.
The result showed the ability of the framework to handle the non-uniform
background situation which often occurred in practice and thus eliminates the
need for inferencing the background required by existing methods. The gradient
statistics of the delamination boundary in the thermal image were indicated as
the valid criterion refine the segmentation under the proposed framework. Thus,
improved performance was achieved compared to conventional methods. The
parameter selection and the limitation of this approach were also discussed.

theory superpositions of states with different masses are unphysical. While MSR
features even in textbooks, its validity, physical content and consequences
remain debated. Its original derivation is known to be inconsistent, while a
consistent approach does not yield a superselection rule. Yet, superpositions
of masses do not seem to be present in Newtonian physics. Here we offer a
resolution of the MSR puzzle. Crucial for the result is the understanding of
two issues: how the notion of a mass parameter arises from the fundamentally
dynamical relativistic notion of mass-energy, and what is the correct Newtonian
limit of relativistic dynamics of composite particles. The result explains the
physical content of the MSR without invoking any non-standard physics and
clarifies the relation between MSR and a formalism describing relativistic
composite particles, developed for studying relativistic effects in table top
experiments.

models, but pruning has also been motivated by the desire to prevent
overfitting. This motivation is particularly relevant given the perhaps
surprising observation that a wide variety of pruning approaches increase test
accuracy despite sometimes massive reductions in parameter counts. To better
understand this phenomenon, we analyze the behavior of pruning over the course
of training, finding that pruning's benefit to generalization increases with
pruning's instability (defined as the drop in test accuracy immediately
following pruning). We demonstrate that this ""generalization-stability
tradeoff"" is present across a wide variety of pruning settings and propose a
mechanism for its cause: pruning regularizes similarly to noise injection.
Supporting this, we find less pruning stability leads to more model flatness
and the benefits of pruning do not depend on permanent parameter removal. These
results explain the compatibility of pruning-based generalization improvements
and the high generalization recently observed in overparameterized networks.

  simulation","Submitted for review in Journal of Computational Physics",,,,"physics.comp-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new deep-learning-based reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework is proposed
for application in subsurface flow simulation. The reduced-order model is based
on an existing embed-to-control (E2C) framework and includes an auto-encoder,
which projects the system to a low-dimensional subspace, and a linear
transition model, which approximates the evolution of the system states in low
dimension. In addition to the loss function for data mismatch considered in the
original E2C framework, we introduce a physics-based loss function that
penalizes predictions that are inconsistent with the governing flow equations.
The loss function is also modified to emphasize accuracy in key well quantities
of interest (e.g., fluid production rates). The E2C ROM is shown to be very
analogous to an existing ROM, POD-TPWL, which has been extensively developed
for subsurface flow simulation. The new ROM is applied to oil-water flow in a
heterogeneous reservoir, with flow driven by nine wells operating under
time-varying control specifications. A total of 300 high-fidelity training
simulations are performed in the offline stage, and the network training
requires 10-12~minutes on a Tesla V100 GPU node. Online (runtime) computations
achieve speedups of $\mathcal{O}$(1000) relative to full-order simulations.
Extensive test case results, with well controls varied over large ranges, are
presented. Accurate ROM predictions are achieved for global saturation and
pressure fields at particular times, and for injection and production well
responses as a function of time. Error is shown to increase when 100 or 200
(rather than 300) training runs are used to construct the E2C ROM.

weights in already-trained text classification models and analyzing the
resulting differences in their predictions. While we observe some ways in which
higher attention weights correlate with greater impact on model predictions, we
also find many ways in which this does not hold, i.e., where gradient-based
rankings of attention weights better predict their effects than their
magnitudes. We conclude that while attention noisily predicts input components'
overall importance to a model, it is by no means a fail-safe indicator.

inverse maps appearing in image restoration tasks. However, their
generalization risk (i.e., test mean-squared-error) and its link to network
design and train sample size remains mysterious. Leveraging the Stein's
Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE), this paper analyzes the generalization risk
with its bias and variance components for recurrent unrolled networks. We
particularly investigate the degrees-of-freedom (DOF) component of SURE, trace
of the end-to-end network Jacobian, to quantify the prediction variance. We
prove that DOF is well-approximated by the weighted \textit{path sparsity} of
the network under incoherence conditions on the trained weights. Empirically,
we examine the SURE components as a function of train sample size for both
recurrent and non-recurrent (with many more parameters) unrolled networks. Our
key observations indicate that: 1) DOF increases with train sample size and
converges to the generalization risk for both recurrent and non-recurrent
schemes; 2) recurrent network converges significantly faster (with less train
samples) compared with non-recurrent scheme, hence recurrence serves as a
regularization for low sample size regimes.

design an algorithm to map from the resulting graphical structure to the space
of the pre-trained embeddings. Finally, we evaluate our approach on a range of
rare and unseen word tasks across various domains and show that our model can

In
the classical setting, where the number of observations is much larger than the
number of parameters, properties of the maximum likelihood estimator in
logistic regression are well understood. Recently, Sur and Candes have studied
logistic regression in the high-dimensional regime, where the number of
observations and parameters are comparable, and show, among other things, that
the maximum likelihood estimator is biased. In the high-dimensional regime the
underlying parameter vector is often structured (sparse, block-sparse,
finite-alphabet, etc.) and so in this paper we study regularized logistic
regression (RLR), where a convex regularizer that encourages the desired
structure is added to the negative of the log-likelihood function. An advantage
of RLR is that it allows parameter recovery even for instances where the
(unconstrained) maximum likelihood estimate does not exist. We provide a
precise analysis of the performance of RLR via the solution of a system of six
nonlinear equations, through which any performance metric of interest (mean,
mean-squared error, probability of support recovery, etc.) can be explicitly
computed. Our results generalize those of Sur and Candes and we provide a
detailed study for the cases of $\ell_2^2$-RLR and sparse
($\ell_1$-regularized) logistic regression. In both cases, we obtain explicit
expressions for various performance metrics and can find the values of the
regularizer parameter that optimizes the desired performance. The theory is
validated by extensive numerical simulations across a range of parameter values
and problem instances.

Many educators have created databases consisting of multiple data sets for use

database is made available.
  We describe the use of open data in introductory courses. Countries and
cities continue to share data through open data portals. Hence, educators can
find regional data that engages their students more effectively. We present
excerpts from case studies that show the application of statistical methods to
data on: crime, housing, rainfall, tourist travel, and others. Data wrangling

observations at various levels of abstraction. One of the most basic prediction
tasks is view prediction: how would a given scene look from an alternative
viewpoint? Humans excel at this task. Our ability to imagine and fill in
missing information is tightly coupled with perception: we feel as if we see
the world in 3 dimensions, while in fact, information from only the front
surface of the world hits our retinas. This paper explores the role of view
prediction in the development of 3D visual recognition. We propose neural 3D
mapping networks, which take as input 2.5D (color and depth) video streams
captured by a moving camera, and lift them to stable 3D feature maps of the
scene, by disentangling the scene content from the motion of the camera. The
model also projects its 3D feature maps to novel viewpoints, to predict and
match against target views. We propose contrastive prediction losses to replace
the standard color regression loss, and show that this leads to better
performance on complex photorealistic data. We show that the proposed model
learns visual representations useful for (1) semi-supervised learning of 3D
object detectors, and (2) unsupervised learning of 3D moving object detectors,
by estimating the motion of the inferred 3D feature maps in videos of dynamic
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that empirically
shows view prediction to be a scalable self-supervised task beneficial to 3D

on the fly. The key of such algorithms is an unbiased estimation of gradients,
which is often (trivially) achieved by uniformly sampling from the entire
parameter space. This unfortunately introduces high-variance in gradient
estimation, and leads to a worse regret of model estimation, especially when
the dimension of parameter space is large.
  In this paper, we aim at reducing the variance of gradient estimation in OL2R
algorithms. We project the selected updating direction into a space spanned by
the feature vectors from examined documents under the current query (termed the
""document space"" for short), after interleaved test. Our key insight is that
the result of interleaved test solely is governed by a user's relevance
evaluation over the examined documents. Hence, the true gradient introduced by
this test result should lie in the constructed document space, and components
orthogonal to the document space in the proposed gradient can be safely removed
for variance reduction. We prove that the projected gradient is an unbiased
estimation of the true gradient, and show that this lower-variance gradient
estimation results in significant regret reduction. Our proposed method is
compatible with all existing OL2R algorithms which rank documents using a
linear model. Extensive experimental comparisons with several state-of-the-art
OL2R algorithms have confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed method in
reducing the variance of gradient estimation and improving overall performance.

effectively locate and recognize handwritten answers. In BAGS, all the answers

introducing the general approach, it is shown how to ensure that collision

reduce throughput of other important messages, we then show how to reformulate

ensuring safety is maintained and actuator limits are respected. We validate

we demonstrate how multi-spatial fields which can have any marginal
distributions and exhibit complex dependence structures can be constructed. To
this end we develop a model where a latent process of these physical phenomena
is modelled as Multiple Gaussian Process (MGP), and the dependence structure
between these phenomena is captured through a Copula process. This model has
the advantage of allowing one to choose any marginal distributions for the
physical phenomenon. Second, we develop an efficient and robust linear
estimation algorithm to predict the mean behaviour of the physical phenomena
using rank correlation instead of the conventional linear Pearson correlation.
Our approach has the advantage of avoiding the need to derive intractable
predictive posterior distribution and also has a tractable solution for the

uses the conventional linear Pearson correlation metric in terms of the
prediction mean-squared-errors (MSE). This provides the motivation for using
our models for multimodal data fusion.

particle physics. Several experimental ``anomalies'' could be explained by
introducing ~eV mass scaled light sterile neutrinos. Many experiments are
actively hunting for such light sterile neutrinos through neutrino oscillation.
For long baseline experiments, matter effect needs to be treated carefully for
precise neutrino oscillation probability calculation. However, it is usually
time-consuming or analytical complexity. In this manuscript we adopt the
Jacobi-like method to diagonalize the Hermitian Hamiltonian matrix and derive
analytically simplified neutrino oscillation probabilities for 3 (active) + 1
(sterile)-neutrino mixing for a constant matter density. These approximations
can reach quite high numerical accuracy while keeping its analytical simplicity
and fast computing speed. It would be useful for the current and future long
baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.

Furthermore, we demonstrate the bistable nonvolatile memory states that can be
switched in-situ without the inconvenient heat-assisted procedure, and robustly
preserved even at zero magnetic field, due to the modified interlayer coupling

head word. Specifically, we propose Anchor-Region Networks (ARNs), a
sequence-to-nuggets architecture for nested mention detection. ARNs first
identify anchor words (i.e., possible head words) of all mentions, and then
recognize the mention boundaries for each anchor word by exploiting regular
phrase structures. Furthermore, we also design Bag Loss, an objective function
which can train ARNs in an end-to-end manner without using any anchor word

In this paper, we provide the first rigorous study on diagnosing elements of
adversarial training, which reveals two intriguing properties.
  First, we study the role of normalization. Batch normalization (BN) is a
crucial element for achieving state-of-the-art performance on many vision
tasks, but we show it may prevent networks from obtaining strong robustness in
adversarial training. One unexpected observation is that, for models trained
with BN, simply removing clean images from training data largely boosts
adversarial robustness, i.e., 18.3%. We relate this phenomenon to the
hypothesis that clean images and adversarial images are drawn from two
different domains. This two-domain hypothesis may explain the issue of BN when
training with a mixture of clean and adversarial images, as estimating
normalization statistics of this mixture distribution is challenging. Guided by
this two-domain hypothesis, we show disentangling the mixture distribution for
normalization, i.e., applying separate BNs to clean and adversarial images for
statistics estimation, achieves much stronger robustness. Additionally, we find
that enforcing BNs to behave consistently at training and testing can further
enhance robustness.
  Second, we study the role of network capacity. We find our so-called ""deep""
networks are still shallow for the task of adversarial learning. Unlike
traditional classification tasks where accuracy is only marginally improved by
adding more layers to ""deep"" networks (e.g., ResNet-152), adversarial training
exhibits a much stronger demand on deeper networks to achieve higher
adversarial robustness. This robustness improvement can be observed
substantially and consistently even by pushing the network capacity to an
unprecedented scale, i.e., ResNet-638.

types of dark energies. First, we consider the phantom class ($\omega<-1$)
which would be responsible for a super-accelerated cosmic expansion, and then
we apply the procedure to an ordinary $\Lambda>0$ vacuum ($\omega=-1$). This is
done by analytically solving the Wheeler-DeWitt equation with ordering term
(WdW) in the cosmology of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker. In this paper, we find
exact solutions in the scale factor $a$ and the ordering parameter $q$. For
$q=1$ it is shown that the universe has a high probability of evolving from a
big bang singularity. On the other hand, for $q = 0$ the solution indicates
that an initial singularity is unlikely. Instead, the universe has maximal
probability of starting with a finite well-defined size which we compute
explicitly at primordial times. We also study the time evolution of the scale
factor by means of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and show that an ultimate big
rip singularity emerges explicitly from our solutions. The phantom scenario
thus predicts a dramatic end in which the universe would reach an infinite
scale factor in a finite cosmological time as pointed by Caldwell et al. in a
classical setup. Finally, we solve the WdW equation with ordinary constant dark
energy and show that in this case the universe does not rip apart in a finite
era.

a_i,a_j\in A\}.$$ The set $A$ is said to be sum-dominant if $|A+A|>|A-A|$. We
prove the following results.
  1) The union of two arithmetic progressions (with the same common difference)
is not sum-dominant. This result partially proves a conjecture proposed by the
author in a previous paper; that is, the union of any two arbitrary arithmetic
progressions is not sum-dominant.
  2) Hegarty proved that a sum-dominant set must have at least $8$ elements
with computers' help. The author of the current paper provided a
human-verifiable proof that a sum-dominant set must have at least $7$ elements.
A natural question is about the largest cardinality of sum-dominant subsets of
an arithmetic progression. Fix $n\ge 16$. Let $N$ be the cardinality of the
largest sum-dominant subset(s) of $\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$ that contain(s) $0$ and
$n-1$. Then $n-7\le N\le n-4$; that is, from an arithmetic progression of
length $n\ge 16$, we need to discard at least $4$ and at most $7$ elements (in
a clever way) to have the largest sum-dominant set(s).
  3) Let $R\in \mathbb{N}$ have the property that for all $r\ge R$,
$\{1,2,\ldots,r\}$ can be partitioned into $3$ sum-dominant subsets, while
$\{1,2,\ldots,R-1\}$ cannot. Then $24\le R\le 145$. This result answers a
question by the author et al. in another paper on whether we can find a
stricter upper bound for $R$.

The observations benefit from the specifically compact, ordered and polar

mid-infrared photon with the vibrons of phospholipid tails in the myelin. The
underlying physics is revealed to be the collectively coherent superposition of
the photon and vibrons, the polariton induced significant enhancement of myelin
permittivity, and the resonance of the polariton with the sheath cell. The
captured cell-VPs in myelin sheaths may provide a promising way for

anisotropic yield stress system: electrorheological (ER) fluids that show
structure formation in the direction of electric field. We subject the ER
fluids to superposition of orthogonal stress fields that leads to different
yield stress values. We obtain a yielding state diagram by plotting normalized
rotational shear stress against normalized radial shear stress corresponding to

the Hill yielding criterion, which is a general yielding criterion for

universality of its application to anisotropic systems including conventional
anisotropic soft materials having yield stress.

that mixed-morphology (MM) SNRs evolve in very dense environments, and that
their centre-filled X-ray morphology is due to interactions between the SNRs
and their surroundings. We aim to determine whether MMSNR VRO 42.05.01 is
embedded in, and interacting with, a dense molecular environment. We used the
IRAM telescope in Pico Veleta, Spain, to search for interaction between the SNR
and neighbouring molecular clouds. We observed a region of $26'\times14'$
towards the west of VRO 42.05.01 and a region of $8'\times4'$ towards the north
of the remnant in the $^{12}$CO $J=1-0$, $^{13}$CO $J=1-0$, and $^{12}$CO
$J=2-1$ transitions with the EMIR receiver. We made maps of the properties of
the observed molecular clouds (peak temperatures, central velocities, velocity
dispersions), column density along the line of sight, and ratio of the
$^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ to $^{12}$CO $J=1-0$ transitions. We analyse archival
optical, infrared, and radio spectroscopic data for other hints on the nature
of the medium. We do not find conclusive physical proof that the SNR is
interacting with the few, clumpy molecular clouds that surround it in the
region of our observations, although there is some suggestion of such
interaction (in a region outside our map) from infrared emission. There is a
velocity gradient in one of the molecular clouds that is consistent with a
stellar wind blown by a $12-14$ $M_{\odot}$ progenitor star. We reassess the
literature distance to VRO 42.05.01, and propose that it has a local standard
of rest velocity of $-6$ km s$^{-1}$, and that it is located $1.0\pm0.4$ kpc
away (the earlier distance value was $4.5\pm1.5$ kpc). We find that a dust

configuration of vortex sheets ensuring that the corresponding circulation
density is real-valued and also vanishes at all sheet endpoints such that the

determined by evaluating a certain integral formula. As an illustration of this

generalizes the well-known solution involving single rotating vortex sheet.
With the geometry of the configuration specified analytically, the
corresponding circulation densities are obtained in terms of a integral
expression which in some cases lends itself to an explicit evaluation. It is
argued that as the number of sheets in the equilibrium configuration increases

the most natural plug-in approach to model-based planning: we build the maximum

then find an optimal policy in this empirical MDP. We ask arguably the most
basic and unresolved question in model based planning: is the naive ""plug-in""
approach, non-asymptotically, minimax optimal in the quality of the policy it
finds, given a fixed sample size? Here, the non-asymptotic regime refers to
when the sample size is sublinear in the model size.
  With access to a generative model, we resolve this question in the strongest
possible sense: our main result shows that \emph{any} high accuracy solution in
the plug-in model constructed with $N$ samples, provides an $\epsilon$-optimal
policy in the true underlying MDP (where $\epsilon$ is the minimax accuracy
with $N$ samples at every state, action pair). In comparison, all prior
(non-asymptotically) minimax optimal results use model free approaches, such as
the Variance Reduced Q-value iteration algorithm (Sidford et al 2018), while
the best known model-based results (e.g. Azar et al 2013) require larger sample
sizes in their dependence on the planning horizon or the state space. Notably,
we show that the model-based approach allows the use of \emph{any} efficient
planning algorithm in the empirical MDP, which simplifies algorithm design as

Heterostructure engineering of these materials offers unique opportunity to
decouple metal-insulator transition (MIT) from the magnetic transition.
However, the evolution of underlying electronic properties across these
decoupled transitions remains largely unexplored. In order to address this, we
have measured Hall effect on a series of epitaxial NdNiO$_3$ films, spanning a
variety of electronic and magnetic phases. We find that the MIT results in only
partially gapped Fermi surface, whereas full insulating phase forms below the
magnetic transition. In addition, we also find a systematic reduction of the
Hall coefficient ($R_H$) in the metallic phase of these films with epitaxial
strain and also a surprising transition to negative value at large compressive
strain. Partially gapped weakly insulating, paramagnetic phase is reminiscence
of pseudogap behavior of high $T_c$ cuprates. The precursor metallic phase,
which undergoes transition to insulating phase is a non-Fermi liquid with the
temperature exponent ($n$) of resistivity of 1, whereas the exponent increases
to 4/3 in the non-insulating samples. Such nickelate phase diagram with
sign-reversal of $R_H$, pseudo-gap phase and non Fermi liquid behavior are
intriguingly similar to high $T_c$ cuprates, giving important guideline to

user identification and channel estimation scheme. We analyze the packet delay
and throughput of the proposed scheme. We also optimize the transmission
control scheme to maximize the system throughput. Second, a random access
scheme, i.e., the coded slotted ALOHA (CSA) scheme, is designed for erasure
channels to improve the system throughput. By deriving the extrinsic
information transfer (EXIT) functions and optimizing their convergence
behavior, we design the code probability distributions for CSA schemes with
repetition codes and maximum distance separable (MDS) codes to maximize the
expected traffic load, under packet erasure and slot erasure channels. We
derive the asymptotic throughput of CSA schemes over the erasure channels for
an infinite frame length, which is verified to well approximate the throughput
for a practical frame length. Third, an efficient data decoding algorithm for
the CSA scheme is proposed to further improve the system efficiency. We present
a low-complexity physical-layer network coding (PNC) method to obtain linear
combinations of collided packets and design an enhanced message-level
successive interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm to exploit the linear
combinations of collided packets. We propose an analytical framework and derive
the system throughput for the proposed scheme. The CSA scheme is further
optimized to maximize the system throughput and energy efficiency.

unimportant layers according to the priority and erase them after the training.
In addition, we retrain the networks to avoid critical drops in accuracy after

there are many more parameters than the number of training data points, and as
a result, the training loss may have infinitely many global minima (parameter
vectors that perfectly interpolate the training data). Therefore, it is
important to understand which interpolating solutions we converge to, how they
depend on the initialization point and the learning algorithm, and whether they
lead to different generalization performances. In this paper, we study these
questions for the family of stochastic mirror descent (SMD) algorithms, of
which the popular stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a special case. Our
contributions are both theoretical and experimental. On the theory side, we
show that in the overparameterized nonlinear setting, if the initialization is
close enough to the manifold of global minima (something that comes for free in
the highly overparameterized case), SMD with sufficiently small step size
converges to a global minimum that is approximately the closest one in Bregman
divergence. On the experimental side, our extensive experiments on standard
datasets and models, using various initializations, various mirror descents,
and various Bregman divergences, consistently confirms that this phenomenon
happens in deep learning. Our experiments further indicate that there is a
clear difference in the generalization performance of the solutions obtained by
different SMD algorithms. Experimenting on a standard image dataset and network
architecture with SMD with different kinds of implicit regularization, $\ell_1$
to encourage sparsity, $\ell_2$ yielding SGD, and $\ell_{10}$ to discourage
large components in the parameter vector, consistently and definitively shows
that $\ell_{10}$-SMD has better generalization performance than SGD, which in
turn has better generalization performance than $\ell_1$-SMD.

seen as those outward expressions. In the experiment, a driving simulator with

Translating application program interfaces (APIs) used in one language to

aspect of program translation. Existing approaches facilitate the translation
by automatically identifying the API mappings across programming languages.
However, all these approaches still require large amount of manual effort in
preparing parallel program corpora, ranging from pairs of APIs, to manually
identified code in different languages that are considered as functionally
equivalent. To minimize the manual effort in identifying parallel program
corpora and API mappings, this paper aims at an automated approach to map APIs

adaption combined with code embedding, which can better align two vector
spaces: taking as input large sets of programs, our approach first generates
numeric vector representations of the programs, especially the APIs used in
each language, and it adapts generative adversarial networks (GAN) to align the
vectors from the spaces of two languages. For a better alignment, we initialize
the GAN with parameters derived from optional API mapping seeds that can be
identified accurately with a simple automatic signature-based matching
heuristic. Then the cross-language API mappings can be identified via
nearest-neighbors queries in the aligned vector spaces.

are constructs in types and processes that specify sequencing in protocols.
Here we study minimal session types, session types without sequencing. This is
arguably the simplest form of session types. By relying on a core process
calculus with sessions and higher-order concurrency (abstraction passing), we
prove that every process typable with usual (non minimal) session types can be
compiled down into a process typed with minimal session types. This means that
having sequencing constructs in both processes and session types is redundant;
only sequentiality in processes is indispensable, as it can precisely codify
sequentiality in types. Our developments draw inspiration from work by Parrow

We designed an experimental setup to characterize the NIRDAPD dark count rate,

illuminated using a 1050 nm light-emitting diode (LED) as well as 980 nm, 1310

saturation at 1.2x10$^8$ photons per second, a photon detection efficiency of
14.8% at 1050 nm, and pulse detection at 1 GHz. We characterized this NIRDAPD

without direct access to these 3D shapes. This is achieved through multiple
discriminators that encode the distribution of 2D projections of the 3D shapes

alternate between training the generator and training the view prediction

learning other high-dimensional distributions from lower dimensional training

classifiers, which allow partial observations. In particular, we introduce the
notion of a discrimination pattern, which refers to an individual receiving
different classifications depending on whether some sensitive attributes were
observed. Then a model is considered fair if it has no such pattern. We propose
an algorithm to discover and mine for discrimination patterns in a naive Bayes
classifier, and show how to learn maximum likelihood parameters subject to
these fairness constraints. Our approach iteratively discovers and eliminates
discrimination patterns until a fair model is learned. An empirical evaluation
on three real-world datasets demonstrates that we can remove exponentially many
discrimination patterns by only adding a small fraction of them as constraints.

set to deal with low-data problem has been employed for few-shot learning in
recent literature. Yet, these methods do not explicitly exploit the manifold
structures of semantic clusters, which is inefficient for transductive
inference. In this paper, we propose a novel Progressive Cluster Purification
(PCP) method for transductive few-shot learning. The PCP can progressively
purify the cluster by exploring the semantic interdependency in the individual
cluster space. Specifically, the PCP consists of two-level operations:
inter-class classification and intra-class transduction. The inter-class
classification partitions all the test samples into several clusters by
comparing the test samples with the prototypes. The intra-class transduction
effectively explores trustworthy test samples for each cluster by modeling data
relations within a cluster as well as among different clusters. Then, it
refines the prototypes to better represent the real distribution of semantic
clusters. The refined prototypes are used to remeasure all the test instances
and purify each cluster. Furthermore, the inter-class classification and the
intra-class transduction are extremely flexible to be repeated several times to
progressively purify the clusters. Experimental results are provided on two
datasets: miniImageNet dataset and tieredImageNet dataset. The comparison
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show that our
approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both datasets.

decision trees, random forests (RFs) and gradient boosted decision trees

finding the exact minimal adversarial perturbation or a guaranteed lower bound
of it. Existing approaches find the minimal adversarial perturbation by a mixed
integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which takes exponential time so is
impractical for large ensembles. Although this verification problem is
NP-complete in general, we give a more precise complexity characterization. We
show that there is a simple linear time algorithm for verifying a single tree,
and for tree ensembles, the verification problem can be cast as a max-clique
problem on a multi-partite graph with bounded boxicity. For low dimensional
problems when boxicity can be viewed as constant, this reformulation leads to a
polynomial time algorithm. For general problems, by exploiting the boxicity of
the graph, we develop an efficient multi-level verification algorithm that can
give tight lower bounds on the robustness of decision tree ensembles, while
allowing iterative improvement and any-time termination. OnRF/GBDT models
trained on 10 datasets, our algorithm is hundreds of times faster than the
previous approach that requires solving MILPs, and is able to give tight
robustness verification bounds on large GBDTs with hundreds of deep trees.

binary models play an important role. The objective of this paper is to give
motivations for the models and to clarify the role of the binary models for the
various types of ordinal models. It is investigated which binary models are
included in an ordinal model but also how the models can be constructed from a
sequence of binary models. In all the models one finds a Guttman space
structure, which has previously been investigated in particular for the partial
credit model. The consideration of the binary models adds to the interpretation
of model parameters, which is helpful, in particular, in the case of the
partial credit model, for which interpretation is less straightforward than for
the other models. A specific topic that is addressed is the ordering of
thresholds in the partial credit model because for some researchers reversed
ordering is an anomaly, others disagree. It is argued that the ordering of
thresholds is not a constitutive element of the partial credit model.

Using semi-artificial choice data, the proposed approach is shown to very

central in a wide range of applications, such as approximation, de-noising,
compression, shape correspondence and comparison. In this context, our paper
addresses the main aspects of signal approximation, such as the definition,
computation, and comparison of basis functions on arbitrary 3D shapes. Focusing
on the class of basis functions induced by the Laplace-Beltrami operator and
its spectrum, we introduce the diffusion and Laplacian spectral basis
functions, which are then compared with the harmonic and Laplacian
eigenfunctions. As main properties of these basis functions, which are commonly
used for numerical geometry processing and shape analysis, we discuss the
partition of the unity and non-negativity; the intrinsic definition and
invariance with respect to shape transformations (e.g., translation, rotation,
uniform scaling); the locality, smoothness, and orthogonality; the numerical
stability with respect to the domain discretisation; the computational cost and
storage overhead. Finally, we consider geometric metrics, such as the area,
conformal, and kernel-based norms, for the comparison and characterisation of
the main properties of the Laplacian basis functions.

systems typically model images and videos separately, thus failing to exploit
the correlation and the synergy provided by these two media. While a few prior
research efforts have explored the benefits of leveraging still-image datasets
for video analysis, or vice-versa, most of these attempts have been limited to
pretraining a model on one type of visual modality and then adapting it via
finetuning on the other modality. In contrast, in this paper we introduce a
framework that enables joint training of a unified model on mixed collections
of image and video examples spanning different tasks. The key ingredient in our
architecture design is a new network block, which we name UniDual. It consists
of a shared 2D spatial convolution followed by two parallel point-wise
convolutional layers, one devoted to images and the other one used for videos.
For video input, the point-wise filtering implements a temporal convolution.
For image input, it performs a pixel-wise nonlinear transformation. Repeated
stacking of such blocks gives rise to a network where images and videos undergo
partially distinct execution pathways, unified by spatial convolutions
(capturing commonalities in visual appearance) but separated by point-wise
operations (modeling patterns specific to each modality). Extensive experiments
on Kinetics and ImageNet demonstrate that our UniDual model jointly trained on
these datasets yields substantial accuracy gains for both tasks, compared to 1)
training separate models, 2) traditional multi-task learning and 3) the
conventional framework of pretraining-followed-by-finetuning. On Kinetics, the
UniDual architecture applied to a state-of-the-art video backbone model
(R(2+1)D-152) yields an additional video@1 accuracy gain of 1.5%.

correlations. To this aim, it is defined an interaction potential between pair
of vertices, as the probability that they do not belong to the same block of
the random partition. This interaction potential can be seen as an affinity
measure for ``densely connected nodes'' and capture well-separated regions in
network models presenting non-homogeneous landscapes. In this spirit, we
compute this potential and its scaling limits on a complete graph and on a

deep networks. In contrast, people learn complex new concepts even from very
few examples, suggesting that the sample complexity of learning can often be
reduced. Many approaches to few-shot learning build on transferring a
representation from well-sampled classes, or using meta learning to favor
architectures that can learn with few samples. Unfortunately, such approaches
often struggle when learning in an online way or with non-stationary data
streams. Here we describe a new approach to learn with fewer samples, by using
additional information that is provided per sample. Specifically, we show how
the sample complexity can be reduced by providing semantic information about
the relevance of features per sample, like information about the presence of
objects in a scene or confidence of detecting attributes in an image. We
provide an improved generalization error bound for this case. We cast the
problem of using per-sample feature relevance by using a new ellipsoid-margin
loss, and develop an online algorithm that minimizes this loss effectively.
Empirical evaluation on two machine vision benchmarks for scene classification
and fine-grain bird classification demonstrate the benefits of this approach
for few-shot learning.

classical computers at certain tasks. In digital random quantum circuit
approaches for supremacy, the output distribution produced is described by the
Porter-Thomas (PT) distribution. In this regime, the system uniformly explores
its entire Hilbert space, which makes simulating such quantum dynamics with
classical computational resources impossible for large systems. However, the
latter has no direct application so far in solving a specific problem. In this
work, we show that the same sampling complexity can be achieved from driven
analog quantum processors, with less stringent requirements for coherence and
control. More importantly, we discuss how to apply this approach to solve
problems in quantum simulations of phases of matter and machine learning.
Specifically, we consider a simple quantum spin chain with nearest-neighbor
interactions driven by a global magnetic field. We show how quantum supremacy
is achieved as a consequence of the thermalization due to the interplay between
the disorder and the driven many-body dynamics. We analyze how the achieved PT
distribution can be used as an accessible reference distribution to probe the
many-body localization (MBL) phase transition. In the second part of our work,
we show how our setup can be used for generative modeling machine learning
tasks. We propose a novel variational hybrid quantum-classical approach,
exploiting the system's inherent tunable MBL dynamics, to train the device to
learn distributions of complex classical data. The performance of our training
protocol depends solely on the phase that the quantum system is in, which makes
fine-tuning of local parameters not necessary. The protocol is implementable in
a range of driven quantum many-body systems, compatible with noisy

one for the thin disk stars. Comparisons of our observed results with models of
disk formation suggest that radial migration could have influenced the chemical
evolution of the thin disk. The formation of the thick disk could be affected
by more than one processes: the accretion model could play an indispensable
role, while other formation mechanisms, such as the radial migration or heating
scenario model could also have a contribution.

field, the field should show evidence of magnetic helicity of opposite signs at
large and small length scales. Measuring this faces two challenges: (i) in
weak-field regions, horizontal field measurements are unreliable because of the
pi ambiguity, and (ii) one needs a truly global approach to computing helicity
spectra in the case where one expects a sign reversal across the equator at all
wavenumbers. Here we develop such a method using spin-2 spherical harmonics to
decompose the linear polarization in terms of the parity-even and parity-odd E
and B polarizations, respectively. Using simple one- and two-dimensional
models, we show that the product of the spectral decompositions of E and B,
taken at spherical harmonic degrees that are shifted by one, can act as a proxy
of the global magnetic helicity with a sign that represents that in the
northern hemisphere. We then apply this method to the analysis of solar
synoptic vector magnetograms, from which we extract a pseudo-polarization
corresponding to a ""pi-ambiguated"" magnetic field, i.e., a magnetic field
vector that has no arrow. We find a negative sign of the global EB helicity
proxy at spherical harmonic degrees of around 6. This could indicate a positive
magnetic helicity at large length scales, but the spectrum fails to capture
clear evidence of the well-known negative magnetic helicity at smaller scales.
This method might also be applicable to stellar and Galactic polarization data.

The numerical study of FRMs through a full geometrical resolution of the two

subject resort to homogenization theory, and exploit strong regularity
assumptions on the fibers distribution. Both approaches fall short in
intermediate regimes where lack of regularity does not justify a homogenized
approach, and when the fiber geometry or their numerosity render the fully

distributed Lagrange multiplier approach, where the effect of the fibers is
superimposed on a background isotropic material through an independent
description of the fibers. The two phases are coupled through a constraint
condition, opening the way for intricate fiber-bulk couplings as well as
allowing complex geometries with no alignment requirements between the
discretisation of the background elastic matrix and the fibers. We analyze both
a full order coupling, where the elastic matrix is coupled with fibers that
have a finite thickness, as well as a reduced order model, where the position
of their centerline uniquely determines the fibers. Well posedness, existence,
and uniquess of solutions are shown both for the continuous models, and for the
finite element discretizations. We validate our approach against the models

theory (CFT) at finite temperature by field theoretic and holographic methods.
First, by the replica method with the twist operators, we construct the general
formula of the RE and EE up to the first order of a deformation parameter. By
using our general formula, we show that the EE of multiple intervals for a
holographic CFT is just a summation of the single interval case even with the
small deformation. This is a non-trivial consequence from the field theory
perspective, though it may be expected by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in
holography. However, the deformed RE of the two intervals is a summation of the
single interval case only if the separations between the intervals are big
enough. It can be understood by the tension of the cosmic branes dual to the
RE. We also study the holographic EE for single and two intervals with an
arbitrary cut-off radius (dual to the $T\overline{T}$ deformation) at any
temperature. We confirm our holographic results agree with the field theory
results with a small deformation and high temperature limit, as expected. For
two intervals, there are two configurations for EE: disconnected ($s$-channel)
and connected ($t$-channel) ones. We investigate the phase transition between
them as we change parameters: as the deformation or temperature increases the
phase transition is suppressed and the disconnected phase is more favored.

$\Lambda_{c\bar{c}}(4403)$, which are formed as pseudoscalar meson baryon
molecules, mainly decay to the $\eta_c \Lambda$ channel. For the two vector
meson baryon molecule states, our results show that the total decay width with
$J^P=\frac12^-$ is by one order of magnitude larger than that with
$J^P=\frac32^-$. The decay patterns and relative decay ratios are very
different for $\Lambda_{c\bar{c}}(4370)$ being a $D_s^{* -} \Lambda_c^+$ or
$\bar{D}^{*} \Xi_c$ molecule state. The main decay channels of
$\Lambda_{c\bar{c}}(4550)$ are $\bar{D}^{(*)} \Xi^{(*,\prime)}_c$ because of
the pseudoscalar meson exchange mechanism. In addition, $\bar{D}^{*} \Xi_c$ is
the dominant decay channel of $\Lambda_{c\bar{c}}(4490)$ which is assumed as a

properties of the polar semiconductor, such as GaN are dominated by interface
phonons, thus the optical properties of the vertical heterostructure depend
strongly on the interface exciton-phonon coupling. The origin and activation of
different Raman modes in the heterostructure due to coupling between
interfacial phonons and optically generated carriers in a monolayer MoS2-GaN
(0001) heterostructure was observed. This coupling strongly influences the
non-equilibrium absorption properties of MoS2 and the emission properties of
both semiconductors. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were
performed to study the band alignment of the interface, which revealed a type-I
heterostructure. The optical excitation with interband transition in MoS2 at
K-point strongly modulates the C excitonic band in MoS2. The overlap of
absorption and emission bands of GaN with the absorption bands of MoS2 induces
the energy and charge transfer across the interface with an optical excitation
at {\Gamma}-point. A strong modulation of the excitonic absorption states is
observed in MoS2 on GaN substrate with transient optical pump-probe
spectroscopy. The interaction of carriers with phonons and defect states leads
to the enhanced and blue shifted emission in MoS2 on GaN substrate. Our results
demonstrate the relevance of interface coupling between phonons and carriers

performance. Specifically, we perform one-to-one data augmentation to learn the
more effective features. The data and the augmented data are simultaneously
input into the autoencoder to obtain latent features and the augmented latent
features whose similarity are constrained by an augmentation loss. Then, making
use of the maximum mean discrepancy distance (MMD), we combine the latent
features and augmented latent features to make their distribution close to the
PEDCC distribution (uniform distribution between classes, Dirac distribution
within the class) to further learn clustering-oriented features. At the same
time, the MSE of the original input image and reconstructed image is used as
reconstruction constraint, and the Sobel smooth loss to build generalization
constraint to improve the generalization ability. Finally, extensive
experiments on three common datasets MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, COIL20 are
conducted. The experimental results show that the algorithm has achieved the

the two beamlets will be decoupled when $\delta\omega_0$ is larger than certain
thresholds, which are derived for stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), stimulated
Brillouin scattering (SBS), and two plasmon decay (TPD), respectively. In this

and can be controlled at a low level provided the laser intensity for

instabilities with two or more beamlets ($N\sim20$) have been carried out and
the above theory model is validated. Simulations confirm that the development
of parametric instabilities with multiple beamlets can be controlled at a low
level, provided the threshold conditions for $\delta\omega_0$ is satisfied,

bar forming in a Milky Way-like galaxy. The galaxy is initially composed of an
axisymmetric, exponential stellar disk embedded in a spherical dark matter
halo. The parameters of the model are chosen so that the galaxy is mildly
unstable to bar formation and the evolution is followed for 10 Gyr. A strong
bar forms slowly over the first few Gyr and buckles after 4.5 Gyr from the
start of the simulation becoming much weaker and developing a pronounced
boxy/peanut shape. We measure the properties of the bar at the time of buckling
in terms of the mean acceleration, velocity and distortion in the vertical
direction. The maps of these quantities in face-on projections reveal
characteristic quadrupole patterns which wind up over a short time-scale. We
also detect a secondary buckling event lasting much longer and occurring only
in the outer part of the bar. We then study the orbital structure of the bar in
periods before and after the first buckling. We find that most of the buckling
orbits originate from x1 orbits supporting the bar. During buckling the ratio
of the vertical to horizontal frequency of the stellar orbits decreases
dramatically and after buckling the orbits obey a very tight relation between
the vertical and circular frequency: $3 \nu = 4 \Omega$. We propose that
buckling is initiated by the vertical resonance of the x1 orbits creating the
initial distortion of the bar that later evolves as kinematic bending waves.

$h^{p,q}$ (that is, with $pq(n{-}p)(n{-}q)=0$) for the intersection cohomology

that the central fiber is reduced, projective, and has only rational
singularities. This can be shown to be equivalent to the invariance of the
dimension of the cohomology of structure sheaf (which is known in the
algebraizable case), since we can prove the Hodge symmetry for all the Hodge

  For the proof of the main theorem, we calculate the graded pieces of the
induced $V$-filtration for the first non-zero member of the Hodge filtration on
the intersection complex Hodge module of the total space, which coincides with
the direct image of the dualizing sheaf of a desingularization (related to
Koll\'ar's conjecture on the direct images of dualizing sheaves of smooth
varieties). This calculation implies also that the order of nilpotence of the
local monodromy is smaller than the general singularity case by 2 in the
situation of the main theorem assuming further smoothness of general fibers. We
can prove a partial converse of the main theorem under some hypothesis.

unpredictability of environmental conditions, and yet mainstream models of
metabolic regulation are typically based on strict optimality principles that
do not account for uncertainty. This paper introduces a dynamic metabolic
modelling framework that is a synthesis of recent ideas on resource allocation
and the powerful optimal control formulation of Ramkrishna and colleagues. In
particular, their work is extended based on the hypothesis that cellular
resources are allocated among elementary flux modes according to the principle
of maximum entropy. These concepts both generalise and unify prior approaches
to dynamic metabolic modelling by establishing a smooth interpolation between
dynamic flux balance analysis and dynamic metabolic models without regulation.
The resulting theory is successful in describing `bet-hedging' strategies
employed by cell populations dealing with uncertainty in a fluctuating
environment, including heterogenous resource investment, accumulation of
reserves in growth-limiting conditions, and the observed behaviour of yeast
growing in batch and continuous cultures. The maximum entropy principle is also
shown to yield an optimal control law consistent with partitioning resources
between elementary flux mode families, which has important practical
implications for model reduction, selection, and simulation.

candidates of three of the most nearby and best studied open clusters in the
sky.
  Results: We cross-correlated the Gaia catalogue with large-scale public

design a realistic experimental setup with real GPS data and sensible spoofing

by the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian, which cannot be achieved by the
conventional approach with three-level atoms coupled to the cavity field at

cancel Stark shifts emerging in the leading order. Once this is accomplished,
the dynamics of the cavity features a degenerate stationary state manifold of
pure states. We derive the analytic form of these states and show that they
include Schr\""odinger cat states with a tunable mean photon number. We also
confirm these states can be useful in phase estimation protocols with their
quantum Fisher information exceeding the standard limit. To account for
realistic imperfections, we consider single-photon losses from the cavity,
finite lifetime of atom levels, and higher order corrections in the far-detuned
limit, which result in metastability of formerly stationary cavity states and
long-time dynamics with a unique mixed stationary state. Despite being mixed,
this stationary state can still feature quantum Fisher information above the
standard limit. Our work delivers a comprehensive overview of the two-photon

the moduli subspace of flat connections $M(P)$ on a principal $G$-bundle $P$
over a closed Riemannian manifold $X$ of dimension $d\geq 2$ is bounded by a
constant times the $L^p$ norm of the curvature, $\|F_A\|_{L^p(X)}$, when $G$ is
a compact Lie group, $F_A$ is $L^p$-small, and $p>d/2$. While we prove that
this estimate holds when the Yang-Mills energy function on the space of Sobolev
connections is Morse-Bott along the moduli subspace $M(P)$ of flat connections,
it does not hold when the Yang-Mills energy function fails to be Morse-Bott,
such as at the product connection in the moduli space of flat $\mathrm{SU}(2)$
connections over a real two-dimensional torus. However, we prove that a useful

$\|F_A\|_{L^p(X)}$ by a suitable power $\|F_A\|_{L^p(X)}^\lambda$, where the

$M(P)$. The proof of our refinement involves gradient flow and Morse theory for
the Yang-Mills energy function on the quotient space of Sobolev connections and
a Lojasiewicz distance inequality for the Yang-Mills energy function. A special
case of our estimate, when $X$ has dimension four and the connection $A$ is

increasingly popular research topic. For preserving the agents' privacy, agents
jointly compute a plan that achieves mutual goals by keeping certain
information private to the individual agents. Unfortunately, this can severely
restrict the accuracy of the heuristic functions used while searching for
solutions. It has been recently shown that, for centralized planning, the
performance of goal oriented search can be improved by combining goal oriented
search and width-based search. The combination of these techniques has been
called best-first width search. In this paper, we investigate the usage of
best-first width search in the context of (decentralised) multi-agent
privacy-preserving planning, addressing the challenges related to the agents'
privacy and performance. In particular, we show that best-first width search is
a very effective approach over several benchmark domains, even when the search
is driven by heuristics that roughly estimate the distance from goal states,
computed without using the private information of other agents. An experimental
study analyses the effectiveness of our techniques and compares them with the
state-of-the-art.

of entry to developing flexible platform-independent general-purpose code that

In this article and the accompanying tutorials, we present a simple exposition
of numerical methods to solve ordinary differential equations using Python and
TensorFlow. The tutorials consist of a series of Python notebooks that, over
the course of five sessions, will lead novice programmers from writing programs
to integrate simple one-dimensional ordinary differential equations using

layers emerge due to the growth of 3D sheared tearing instability. Diffusion
regions on adjacent reconnection layers form an inflow-outflow coupling that
enhances the local reconnection. Further coupling of the existing energy modes
breeds new energy modes near the current sheet edge. As reconnection layers
span and interact with each other across the whole current sheet, global
magnetic energy consumption accelerates. The significant contribution of 3D

to be independent on magnetic diffusivity. On the other hand, the global guide

following the probability $R_{L,k}(p)$ that a lattice composed of $L \times L$

$k$. The results, obtained for $k$ ranging from 2 to 80, showed that the

plotted as a function of the $k$-mer size. The dependence of $p_c(k)$ was
determined, being $p_c(k)=A+B/(C+\sqrt{k})$, where $A = p_c(k \rightarrow

$k$-mers, $B =-0.47(0.21)$ and $C = 5.79(2.18)$. This behavior is completely
different to that observed for square lattices, where the percolation threshold
decreases with $k$. In addition, the effect of the anisotropy on the properties

finite systems the anisotropy of the deposited layer favors the percolation
along the parallel direction to the nematic axis, in the thermodynamic limit,
the value of the percolation threshold is the same in both parallel and

scintillation (electroluminescence) signal amplification are being proposed for
rare event detection such as directional dark matter, double electron capture
and double beta decay detection. The discrimination of the rare event through
the topological signature of primary ionisation trails is a major asset for
this type of TPC when compared to single liquid or double-phase TPCs, limited
mainly by the high electron diffusion in pure xenon. Helium admixtures with
xenon can be an attractive solution to reduce the electron diffusion
significantly, improving the discrimination efficiency of these optical TPCs.
We have measured the electroluminescence (EL) yield of Xe-He mixtures, in the
range of 0 to 30% He and demonstrated the small impact on the EL yield of the
addition of helium to pure xenon. For a typical reduced electric field of 2.5
kV/cm/bar in the scintillation region, the EL yield is lowered by ~ 2%, 3%, 6%
and 10% for 10%, 15%, 20% and 30% of helium concentration, respectively. This
decrease is less than what has been obtained from the most recent simulation
framework in the literature. The impact of the addition of helium on EL
statistical fluctuations is negligible, within the experimental uncertainties.
The present results are an important benchmark for the simulation tools to be
applied to future optical TPCs based on Xe-He mixtures.

empirically demonstrate the robustness in performance of a CNN on account of
redundancy across its depth, (ii) a method to identify the systemic redundancy

trajectories of ODE systems that optimize the infinite-time average of a

arise when bounding such averages using so-called auxiliary functions. In this
paper we demonstrate that this idea is viable and allows for the computation of
extremal unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) for polynomial ODE systems. First, we
prove that polynomial optimization is guaranteed to produce auxiliary functions
that yield near-sharp bounds on time averages, which is required in order to
localize the extremal orbit accurately. Second, we show that points inside the
relevant sublevel sets can be computed efficiently through direct nonlinear
optimization. Such points provide good initial conditions for UPO computations.
As a proof of concept, we then combine these methods with a single-shooting
Newton-Raphson algorithm to study extremal UPOs for a nine-dimensional model of
sinusoidally forced shear flow. We discover three previously unknown families

results in various applications. While the potential of RL is now
well-established, many critical aspects still need to be tackled, including
safety and stability issues. These issues, while partially neglected by the RL
community, are central to the control community which has been widely
investigating them. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is one of the most
successful control techniques because, among others, of its ability to provide
such guarantees even for uncertain constrained systems. Since MPC is an
optimization-based technique, optimality has also often been claimed.
Unfortunately, the performance of MPC is highly dependent on the accuracy of
the model used for predictions. In this paper, we propose to combine RL and MPC
in order to exploit the advantages of both and, therefore, obtain a controller
which is optimal and safe. We illustrate the results with a numerical example
in simulations.

learning (DRL) algorithm based on maximum entropy reinforcement learning. By
combining off-policy updates with an actor-critic formulation, SAC achieves
state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous-action benchmark tasks,
outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. The off-policy method
employed by SAC samples data uniformly from past experience when performing
parameter updates. We propose Emphasizing Recent Experience (ERE), a simple but
powerful off-policy sampling technique, which emphasizes recently observed data
while not forgetting the past. The ERE algorithm samples more aggressively from
recent experience, and also orders the updates to ensure that updates from old
data do not overwrite updates from new data. We compare vanilla SAC and
SAC+ERE, and show that ERE is more sample efficient than vanilla SAC for
continuous-action Mujoco tasks. We also consider combining SAC with Priority
Experience Replay (PER), a scheme originally proposed for deep Q-learning which
prioritizes the data based on temporal-difference (TD) error. We show that
SAC+PER can marginally improve the sample efficiency performance of SAC, but
much less so than SAC+ERE. Finally, we propose an algorithm which integrates
ERE and PER and show that this hybrid algorithm can give the best results for
some of the Mujoco tasks.

by means of PIV and shadowgraphy in the configuration of a planar prefilming
airblast atomizer. The ambient pressure is varied from 1 to 8 bar. Other
investigated parameters are the gas velocity and the film loading. From
single-phase PIV measurements, it is found that the gas velocity in the
vicinity of the prefilmer partly matches the analytical profile from the
near-wake theory. The characteristics of the liquid accumulation are extracted
from the shadowgraphy images of the liquid phase directly downstream of the
prefilmer. Two different characteristic lengths, as well as the ligament
velocity and a breakup frequency are determined. In addition, the droplets
generated directly downstream of the liquid accumulation are captured. Hence,
the spray Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) and the mean droplet velocity are given
for each operating point. The novelty of this study is that a scaling law of
these quantities with regard to ambient pressure is derived. A correlation is
observed between the characteristic length of the accumulation and the SMD,
thus reinforcing the idea that the liquid accumulation determines the primary
spray characteristics. In this paper, a threshold to distinguish the zones
between primary and secondary breakup is proposed based on an objective
criterion. It is also shown that taking non-spherical droplets into account
significantly modifies the shape of the dropsize distribution, thus stressing
the need to use shadowgraphy when investigating primary breakup. Additionally,
the ambient pressure and the velocity are varied accordingly to keep the
aerodynamic stress $\rho_g U_g^2$ constant. This leads to almost identical
liquid accumulation and spray characteristics.

radiomic framework (mpRadiomic) on 24 patients with brain tumors (8 grade II
and 16 grade IV). The mpRadiomic framework classified grade IV tumors from
grade II tumors with a sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 100%,
respectively, with an AUC of 0.95. For treatment response, the mpRadiomic

a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian model that can account for the zig-zag and

these EPs can coalesce into higher order EPs or anisotropic EPs. These
interface modes hence exhibit and exemplify many complex phenomena related to

on the group in question, this problem includes two types of tractable variants
in undirected graphs: one is the parity-constrained shortest path/cycle
problem, and the other is computing a shortest noncontractible cycle in
surface-embedded graphs.
  For the shortest non-zero path problem with respect to finite abelian groups,
Kobayashi and Toyooka (2017) proposed a randomized, pseudopolynomial-time
algorithm via permanent computation. For a slightly more general class of
groups, Yamaguchi (2016) showed a reduction of the problem to the weighted
linear matroid parity problem. In particular, some cases are solved in strongly
polynomial time via the reduction with the aid of a deterministic,
polynomial-time algorithm for the weighted linear matroid parity problem
developed by Iwata and Kobayashi (2021), which generalizes a well-known fact
that the parity-constrained shortest path problem is solved via weighted
matching.
  In this paper, as the first general solution independent of the group, we
present a rather simple, deterministic, and strongly polynomial-time algorithm
for the shortest non-zero path problem. The algorithm is based on Dijkstra's
algorithm for the unconstrained shortest path problem and Edmonds' blossom
shrinking technique in matching algorithms; this approach is inspired by
Derigs' faster algorithm (1985) for the parity-constrained shortest path
problem via a reduction to weighted matching. Furthermore, we improve our
algorithm so that it does not require explicit blossom shrinking, and make the
computational time match Derigs' one. In the speeding-up step, a dual linear
programming formulation of the equivalent problem based on potential
maximization for the unconstrained shortest path problem plays a key role.

the generalization error of any ensemble based on the margins of the training
data, from which it was concluded that larger margins should lead to lower
generalization error, everything else being equal (sometimes referred to as the
``large margins theory''). Tighter bounds have been derived and have reinforced
the large margins theory hypothesis. For instance, Wang et al. (2011) suggest
that specific margin instances, such as the equilibrium margin, can better
summarize the margins distribution. These results have led many researchers to
consider direct optimization of the margins to improve ensemble generalization
error with mixed results. We show that the large margins theory is not
sufficient for explaining the performance of voting classifiers. We do this by
illustrating how it is possible to improve upon the margin distribution of an
ensemble solution, while keeping the complexity fixed, yet not improve the test

a model must be able to temporarily suppress certain expectations and then
recover those expectations later, essentially pushing and popping these
expectations on a stack. Our results provide evidence that models can
successfully suppress and recover expectations in many cases, but do not fully
recover their previous grammatical state.

fundamental operation that has been studied for long time in terms of the
resource implicitly and explicitly. Yet, it is a long standing open problem to
identify the resource and to clarify the necessary and sufficient amount of
resource for implementing a general unitary operation under conservation laws.
In this paper, we provide a solution to this open problem. We derive an
asymptotically exact equality that clarifies the necessary and sufficient
amount of quantum coherence as a resource to implement arbitrary unitary
operation within a desired error. In this equality, the required coherence cost
is asymptotically expressed with the implementation error and the degree of
violation of conservation law in the desired unitary operation. We also discuss
the underlying physics in several physical situations from the viewpoint of
coherence cost based on the equality. This work does not only provide a
solution to a long-standing problem on the unitary control, but also clarifies
the key question of the resource theory of the quantum channels in the region
of resource theory of asymmetry, for the case of unitary channels.

quantification of the uptake of PET tracers in combined PET/MR scanners.
However, current techniques for MRAC usually require multiple acquisitions or
complex post-processing to discriminate the different tissues. Inspired by the
ancient Greeks, who believed that matter was made of the combination of four
elements (earth, water, air and fire), we formulated a multi-component Magnetic
Resonance (MR) Fingerprinting framework, where every voxel was considered a
weighted combination of four base elements: bone, water, air and fat. We named
our approach Aristotelian MR based attenuation correction (ARISTOMRAC). We used
a 3D radial acquisition scheme at 1.5T, acquiring a transient-state spoiled
acquisition with variable flip angles and echo times (TE), with the shortest
TEs being ultra-short echo times (UTE). We simulated a multi-tissue MR signal
model using the Bloch equations and used dictionary matching to extract tissue
fraction maps for bone water and fat, while air fractions were obtained by
thresholding the UTE parts of our acquisitions at higher spatial resolution.
Compared to previous methods for MR-based Attenuation Correction (MRAC), our
approach used a full multi-component signal model, including multiple tissues
per voxel. For this reason, rather than reconstructing high resolutions images,
MR data can be acquired more efficiently, directly at the resolution needed for
PET attenuation maps. The ARISTOMRAC method allows to accurately estimate the
air, water, bone and fat fractions (Concordance Correlation Coefficient =
0.81/0.91/0.98 for bone, water and fat respectively). Attenuation maps could be
obtained in the head and neck with a single 1-minute acquisition.

Lanczos algorithm. The major advantage of this method is that its scaling does
not depend on the number of frequency points. We have tested the applicability

as the Beveridge curve and provides new insights for explaining the curve's
counter-clockwise cyclicality. At the micro level, our model provides
occupation-specific estimates of changes in short and long-term unemployment
corresponding to a given automation shock. We find that the network structure
plays an important role in determining unemployment levels, with occupations in
particular areas of the network having very few job transition opportunities.
Such insights could be fruitfully applied to help design more efficient and
effective policies aimed at helping workers adapt to the changing nature of the
labor market.

hand, it is a common strategy to ensemble different models in order to increase
the final accuracy. Even though averaging different model predictions is a
common choice, an exhaustive analysis of different ensemble techniques has not

operators for the output of the different models of the ensemble. Finally, the
work carried out in this paper is highly oriented towards real-time
implementations. In this context, as the number of applications for audio

different network depths and efficient solutions for aggregating ensemble

the demand-aware inter-slice resource management issue in network slicing by
regarding the varying demands and the allocated bandwidth as the environment
state and the action, respectively. However, allocating bandwidth in a finer
resolution usually implies larger action space, and unfortunately DQL fails to
quickly converge in this case. In this paper, we introduce discrete normalized
advantage functions (DNAF) into DQL, by separating the $\mathcal{Q}$-value
function as a state-value function term and an advantage term and exploiting a
deterministic policy gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to avoid the unnecessary
calculation of $\mathcal{Q}$-value for every state-action pair. Furthermore, as
DPGD only works in continuous action space, we embed a k-nearest neighbor
algorithm into DQL to quickly find a valid action in the discrete space nearest

DQL through extensive simulations.

open the question of their practical implementation in hardware platforms which

reversible circuits are elements of Euclidean spaces, making their physical

circuit model for quantum computing is mapped into that of reversible computing
in a mathematically robust fashion using Nash embedding so that every quantum

Survey Data Release 5, Steinhardt & Elvis discovered a sub-Eddington boundary
and a redshift-dependent drop-off at higher black hole mass, possible clues to
the growth history of massive black holes. Our contribution to this special
issue of Universe amounts to an application of a model for black hole accretion
and jet formation to these observations. For illustrative purposes we include
about 100,000 data points from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7
where the sub-Eddington boundary is also visible, and propose a theoretical
picture that explains these features. By appealing to thin disk theory and both
the lower accretion efficiency and the time evolution of jetted quasars
compared to non-jetted quasars in our 'gap paradigm', we explain two features
of the sub-Eddington boundary. First, we show that a drop-off on the quasar
mass-luminosity plane for larger black hole mass occurs at all redshifts. But
the fraction of jetted quasars is directly related to the merger function in
this paradigm, which means the jetted quasar fraction drops with decrease in
redshift, which allows us to explain a second feature of the sub-Eddington
boundary, namely a redshift dependence of the slope of the quasar
mass-luminosity boundary at high black hole mass stemming from a change in
radiative efficiency with time. We are able to reproduce the mass dependence
of, as well as the oscillating behavior in, the slope of the sub-Eddington
boundary as a function of time. The basic physical idea involves retrograde
accretion occurring only for a subset of the more massive black holes which
implies that most spinning black holes in our model are prograde accretors. In
short, this paper amounts to a qualitative overview of how a sub-Eddington
boundary naturally emerges in the gap paradigm.

proposed a novel HT detection method using information entropy based
clustering, named HTDet. The key insight of HTDet is that the Trojan usually be
inserted in the regions with low controllability and low observability in order
to maintain high concealment, which will result in that Trojan logics appear
extremely low transitions during the simulation. This means that the logical
regions with the low transitions will provide us with much more abundant and
more important information for HT detection. Therefore, HTDet applies
information theory technology and a typical density-based clustering algorithm
called Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to
detect all suspicious Trojan logics in circuit under detection (CUD). DBSCAN is
an unsupervised learning algorithm, which can improve the applicability of
HTDet. Besides, we develop a heuristic test patterns generation method using
mutual information to increase the transitions of suspicious Trojan logics.
Experimental evaluation with benchmarks demenstrates the effectiveness of
HTDet.

these models view the representation problem of the test samples as a
deterministic problem, ignoring the uncertainty of the representation. The
uncertainty is caused by two factors, random noise in the samples and the
intrinsic randomness of the sample set, which means that if we capture a group

conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel method based upon Collaborative
Representation that is a special instance of SR and has closed-form solution.
It performs Sparse Representation Fusion based on the Diverse Subset of

set and enhances the robustness of classification results. The proposed method
is suitable for multiple types of data and has no requirement on the pattern

a great amount of resource consumption, especially when the problem size is
large. To overcome these limitations, this paper suggests a method for reducing
the search space of the EAs applied to CluSTP by decomposing the original
problem into two sub-problems, the solution to one of which is found by an EAs
and that to the other is found by another method. The goal of the first
sub-problem is to determine a spanning tree which connects among the clusters,
while the goal of the second sub-problem is to determine the best spanning tree
for each cluster. In addition, this paper proposes a new EAs, which can be
applied to solve the first sub-problem and suggests using the Dijkstra's
algorithm to solve the second sub-problem. The proposed approach is
comprehensively experimented and compared with existing methods. Experimental
results prove that our method is more efficient and more importantly, it can
obtain results which are close to the optimal results.
