as humans naturally exhibit complex behaviors that can change drastically from
one environment to the next. In order to alleviate this issue, we propose to
encode the lower level aspects of human motion separately from the higher level
geometrical aspects, which we believe will generalize better over environments.
In contrast to our prior work~\cite{kratzer2018}, we encode the short-term
behavior by using a state-of-the-art recurrent neural network structure instead
of a Gaussian process. In order to perform longer-term behavior predictions
that account for variation in tasks and environments, we propose to make use of
gradient-based trajectory optimization. Preliminary experiments on real motion

main challenges in shared autonomy systems is to define the arbitration
function, which decides when to let the autonomous agent take over. In this
work, we propose a model and training method to learn the arbitration function.
Our model is based on a recurrent neural network that takes as input the state,
intent prediction scores and user command to produce an arbitration between
user and robot commands. This work extends our previous work on differentiable
policies for shared autonomy. Differentiability of the policy is desirable to
further train the shared autonomy system end-to-end. In this work we propose
training of the arbitration function by using data from user performing the
task with shared control. We present initial results by teleoperating a gripper

to address these difficulties by using unadjusted Langevin algorithms to

how varying synapse weights, input noise and processor temperature affects the

representation of solutions in a previous paper by the author (see [Zhadf]).
For this kind of problems, solutions are obtained via the Limiting Absorption
Principle and we all them LAP solutions. Based on the Floquet-Bloch transform
and analytic Fredholm theory, an LAP solution could be written explicitly as an
integral of quasi-periodic solutions on a contour, which depends on the
periodic structure. Compared to previous numerical methods for this kind of
problems, we do not need to adopt the LAP for approximation, thus a standard
error estimation is easily carried out. Based on this method, we also develop a
numerical solver for the halfguide problems. This method is also based on the
result from [Zhadf], which shows that any LAP solution of a halfguide problem
could be extended into a fullguide problem with a non-vanishing source term(not
uniquely!). So first we approximate the source term from the boundary data by a
regularization method, and then the LAP solution could be obtained from the
corresbonding fullguide problem. At the end of this paper, we also show some
numerical results to present the efficiency of our numerical methods.

attention to iteratively refine lexical representations with information drawn

propagated through a deep network of hidden layers. We argue that the need to
represent and propagate lexical features in each layer limits the model's
capacity for learning and representing other information relevant to the task.
To alleviate this bottleneck, we introduce gated shortcut connections between
the embedding layer and each subsequent layer within the encoder and decoder.
This enables the model to access relevant lexical content dynamically, without
expending limited resources on storing it within intermediate states. We show
that the proposed modification yields consistent improvements over a baseline
transformer on standard WMT translation tasks in 5 translation directions (0.9
BLEU on average) and reduces the amount of lexical information passed along the
hidden layers. We furthermore evaluate different ways to integrate lexical
connections into the transformer architecture and present ablation experiments

Hall effect in Pt. By studying samples with different NiO thicknesses, the NiO

Interestingly, below 30 K, the inverse spin Hall signals are associated with
the GGG substrate. The field dependence of the signal follows a Brillouin
function for a S=7/2 spin ($\mathrm{Gd^{3+}}$) at low temperature. Sharp
changes in the SSE signal at low fields are due to switching of the YIG

observations are important in understanding the generation and transport
properties of spin currents through magnetic insulators and the role of a

fidelity up to hundreds of atoms. We show that in waveguide QED, the problem of
photon counting can be reduced to atom counting, by entangling the photonic
state with an atomic array in the collective number basis. This is possible as
the incoming photons couple to collective atomic states and can be achieved by
engineering a second decay channel of an excited atom to a metastable state.
Our scheme is robust to disorder and finite Purcell factors, and its fidelity
increases with atom number. Analyzing the state of the re-emitted photons, we
further show that if the initial atomic state is a symmetric Dicke state,
dissipation engineering can be used to implement a nondestructive photon-number

to be run in 2011, when a randomized algorithm $O^\star(3^k)$ time algorithm
based on Cut\&Count was introduced.
  In this work, we show the contrary and give a $O^\star(2.7^k)$ time
randomized algorithm. Our algorithm combines all mentioned techniques with
substantial new ideas: First, we show that, given a feedback vertex set of size
$k$ of bounded average degree, a tree decomposition of width $(1-\Omega(1))k$
can be found in polynomial time. Second, we give a randomized branching
strategy inspired by the one from~[Becker et al. (J. Artif. Intell. Res'00)] to
reduce to the aforementioned bounded average degree setting. Third, we obtain
significant run time improvements by employing fast matrix multiplication.

derivative with a fixed algebraic rate of convergence. Nevertheless, we exhibit
a new finite difference operator and prove it has spectral accuracy. Its rate
of convergence is not fixed and improves with the function's regularity. For
example, the rate of convergence is exponential for analytic functions. Our new
framework is conceptually nonstandard, making no use of polynomial
interpolation, nor any other expansion basis, such as typically considered in
approximation theory. Our new method arises solely from the numerical
manipulation of singular integrals, through an accurate quadrature for Cauchy
Principal Value convolutions. The kernel is a distribution which gives rise to
multi-resolution grid coefficients. The respective distributional finite
difference scheme is spatially structured having stencils of different support
widths. These multi-resolution stencils test/estimate function variations in a
nonlocal fashion, giving rise to a highly accurate distributional finite
difference operator. Computational illustrations are presented, where the
accuracy and roundoff error structure are compared with the respective Fourier

main-sequence F-type stars can be characterised by two distinct rotational
regimes. Early-type F-stars are usually rapid rotators with periods typically
below 10 days, whereas later-type F-stars have longer rotation periods.
Specifically, and since the two rotational regimes are tightly connected to the
effective temperatures of the stars, we investigate in detail the
characteristics of the partial ionisation zones in the outer convective
envelopes of these stars, which in turn, depend on the internal temperature
profiles. Our study shows that the two rotational regimes might be
distinguished by the relative locations of the partial ionisation region of
heavy elements and the base of the convective zone. Since in all these stars is
expected a dynamo-driven magnetic field where the shear layer between
convective and radiative zones (tachocline) plays an important role, this
result suggests that the magnetic field may be related to the combined
properties of convection and ionisation.

these phenomena stay unclear. We propose a model that introduces the dynamics
of radicalization, as a reinforcing mechanism driving the evolution to extreme

social interaction dynamics, we consider agents characterized by heterogeneous
activities and homophily. We show that the transition between a global
consensus and emerging radicalized states is mostly governed by social
influence and by the controversialness of the topic discussed. Compared with
empirical data of polarized debates on Twitter, the model qualitatively
reproduces the observed relation between users' engagement and opinions, as
well as opinion segregation in the interaction network. Our findings shed light
on the mechanisms that may lie at the core of the emergence of echo chambers

cosmological timescales generally predict a different gravitational wave
luminosity distance than General Relativity. While this holds for a uniform
variation, we show that if locally screened at the source and at the observer
as required to pass stringent astrophysical tests of gravity, the General
Relativistic distance is restored. In the absence of such a screening, the same
effect must modify electromagnetic luminosity distances inferred from
supernovae Type Ia, to the extent that the effects can cancel in the
comparison. Hence, either the modifications considered employ screening, which
leaves no signature in Standard Sirens of a cosmological modification of
gravity, or screening does not operate, in which case there can be a signal
that is however well below the forseeable sensitivity of the probe when
astrophysical bounds are employed. We recover these results both in the Jordan
and Einstein frames, paying acute attention to pecularities of each frame such
as the notion of redshift or geodesic motions. We emphasise that despite these
limitations, Standard Sirens provide valuable independent tests of gravity that
differ fundamentally from other probes, a circumstance that is generally
important for the wider scope of gravitational modifications and related
scenarios. Finally, we use our results to show that the gravitational wave
propagation is not affected by dark sector interactions, which restores a dark
degeneracy between conformal and disformal couplings that enables
observationally viable cosmic self-acceleration to emenate from those.

procedure. The Robins use a unique method to determine the migratory direction.
In the procedure utilized, the important issue is the effect of the geomagnetic
field on the magnetic momentum of created radical pairs (triplet-singlet
states) dancing with a special frequency. To duplicate the same operational
procedure, the quantum sensor consisting of two coincident tripartite systems
is designed. Each system is separately excited with the entangled photons
(signal and idler) produced through nonlinearity. In a traditional tripartite
system, the microwave cavity mode can be non-classically correlated with the
optical cavity mode. In this study, however, there are two microwave cavities
modes separately affected by the entangled photons, and these modes can be
entangled. The entangled microwave photons play the same role that the
triplet-singlet state of the electrons have in the Robins operating system. It
is the key point that the quantum sensor is deigned to work with, in such a way
that the entangled microwave photons can be strongly affected by the applied
external magnetic field. In fact, it is the criterion employed by the quantum
sensor to sense the magnetic field intensity and the direction. To analyze the
system, the canonical conjugate method is introduced to determine the quantum
sensor Hamiltonian, and then the dynamics equations of motions are analytically
derived using Heisenberg-Langevin equations.

decision making. These systems interact at real time with their environment and
are generally heavily power constrained. Thus, there is a strong need for a
real time agent running on a low power platform. The agent examined is the
Cognitively Enhanced Complex Event Processing (CECEP) architecture. This is an
autonomous decision support tool that reasons like humans and enables enhanced
agent-based decision-making. It has applications in a large variety of domains
including autonomous systems, operations research, intelligence analysis, and
data mining. One of the key components of CECEP is the mining of knowledge from
a repository described as a Cognitive Domain Ontology (CDO). One problem that
is often tasked to CDOs is asset allocation. Given the number of possible
solutions in this allocation problem, determining the optimal solution via CDO
can be very time consuming. In this work we show that a grid of isolated
spiking neurons is capable of generating solutions to this problem very
quickly, although some degree of approximation is required to achieve the
speedup. However, the approximate spiking approach presented in this work was
able to complete all allocation simulations with greater than 99.9% accuracy.
To show the feasibility of low power implementation, this algorithm was
executed using the Intel Loihi manycore neuromorphic processor. Given the vast
increase in speed (greater than 1000 times in larger allocation problems), as
well as the reduction in computational requirements, the presented algorithm is
ideal for moving asset allocation to low power, portable, embedded hardware.

known to be stabilised in chiral ferromagnets with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya

most striking feature is that the emergent topological phase consists of three
SkX interpenetrated sublattices. On the other hand, the pure HTAF, being
described by an SO(3) order parameter, can host Z2 vortices. This rises the
fundamental question on whether both non trivial structures are related. In
this paper we unravel a hidden connection between both topological entities by
studying the HTAF with anisotropic DMI. To this end, we combine an effective
field theory description, the Luttinger-Tisza approximation and Monte Carlo
simulations. We show that even a slight anisotropy in the DMI proves to be the

of our Universe measured from the cosmic microwave background by the Planck

interpretations of that as evidence of new physics. Within conventional
cosmology a likely source of this discrepancy is identified here as a matter
density fluctuation around the cosmic average of the 40 Mpc environment in
which the calibration of Supernovae Type Ia separations with Cepheids and
nearby absolute distance anchors is performed. Inhomogeneities on this scale
easily reach 40% and more. In that context, the discrepant expansion rates
serve as evidence of residing in an underdense region of $\delta_{\rm
env}\approx-0.5\pm0.1$. The probability for finding this local expansion rate
given the Planck data lies at the 95% confidence level. Likewise, a
hypothetical equivalent local data set with mean expansion rate equal to that
of Planck, while statistically favoured, would not gain strong preference over
the actual data in the respective Bayes factor. These results therefore suggest
borderline consistency between the local and Planck measurements of the Hubble
constant. Generally accounting for the environmental uncertainty, the local
measurement may be reinterpreted as a constraint on the cosmological Hubble
constant of $H_0=74.7^{+5.8}_{-4.2}$ km/s/Mpc. The current simplified analysis
may be augmented with the employment of the full available data sets, an impact
study for the immediate $\lesssim10$ Mpc environment of the distance anchors,
more prone to inhomogeneities, as well as expansion rates measured by quasar
lensing, gravitational waves, currently limited to the same 40 Mpc region, and
local galaxy distributions.

emphasis on the peculiar nebular phase and subsequent decay to quiescence. From
the decay timescale of the Balmer emission associated with the nebula we
measure an outflow mass M_wind~4x10^{-6} Msun. Remarkably, this is ~100 times
larger than the accreted mass and ~10% of the total mass stored in the disc.
The wind efficiency must therefore be significantly larger than previous
estimates for black hole transients, suggesting that radiation pressure (in
addition to other mechanisms such as Compton-heating) plays a key role in V404
Cyg. In addition, we compare the evolution of the 2015 and 1989 outbursts and
find clear similarities (namely a large luminosity drop ~10 d after the X-ray
trigger, followed by a brief nebular phase) but also remarkable differences in
decay timescales and long-term evolution of the Halpha profile. In particular,
we see evidence for a rapid disc contraction in 2015, consistent with a burst
of mass transfer. This could be driven by the response of the companion to hard
X-ray illumination, most notably during the last gigantic (super-Eddington)
flare on 25 June 2015. We argue that irradiation and consequential disc wind
are key factors to understand the different outburst histories in 1989 and
2015. In the latter case, radiation pressure may be responsible for the abrupt
end of the outburst through depleting inner parts of the disc, thus quenching
accretion and X-ray irradiation. We also present a refined orbital period and
updated ephemeris.

affected by the gravity of the Sun in Newtonian and Milgromian dynamics (MOND).
The Solar gravity is ${\approx 50\%}$ stronger in MOND beyond a distance of
${\approx 7000}$ astronomical units, the MOND radius of the Sun. A spacecraft
travelling at $0.01 \, c$ reaches this distance after 11.1 years. We show that
the extra gravity in MOND causes an anomalous deceleration that reduces its
radial velocity by ${\approx 3}$ cm/s and the two-way light travel time from
the inner Solar System by ${\approx 0.1}$ seconds after 20 years. A distinctive
signature of MOND is that the gravity from the Sun is not directly towards it.
This is due to the non-linear nature of MOND and the external gravitational
field from the rest of the Galaxy, which we self-consistently include in our
calculations. As a result, the sky position of the spacecraft would deviate by
up to 0.2 mas over 20 years. This deviation is always in the plane containing
the spacecraft trajectory and the direction towards the Galactic Centre. By
launching spacecraft in different directions, it is possible to test the
characteristic pattern of angular deviations expected in MOND. This would
minimize the chance that any detected anomalies are caused by other processes
like drag from the interstellar medium. Such confounding factors could also be
mitigated using an onboard accelerometer to measure non-gravitational forces.
We briefly discuss how the gravity theories could be conclusively distinguished
using a Cavendish-style active gravitational experiment beyond the Sun's MOND
radius.

of the longest-lasting conundrums in frustrated quantum magnetism. Over a wide

dimer-product to the plaquette-based ground state, neither analytical nor any
available numerical methods have come close to reproducing the physics of the
excited states and thermal response. We solve this problem in the dimer-product

the use of thermal pure quantum (TPQ) states to augment dramatically the size
of clusters amenable to exact diagonalization. The second is the use of
tensor-network methods, in the form of infinite projected entangled pair states
(iPEPS), for the calculation of finite-temperature quantities. We demonstrate
convergence as a function of system size in TPQ calculations and of bond
dimension in our iPEPS results, with complete mutual agreement even extremely
close to the QPT. Our methods reveal a remarkably sharp and low-lying feature
in the magnetic specific heat around the QPT, whose origin appears to lie in a
proliferation of excitations composed of two-triplon bound states. The
surprisingly low energy scale and apparently extended spatial nature of these
states explain the failure of less refined numerical approaches to capture
their physics. Both of our methods will have broad and immediate application in
addressing the thermodynamic response of a wide range of highly frustrated

the nuclear transition. This de-excitation can be observed either by searching
for the direct effects of the decaying isomer, or through the re-scattering or

evolves by $\lesssim0.1$ dex at fixed M$_*$ and SFR from $z\sim0-2.2$. We
employ photoionization models to constrain the ionization parameter and
ionizing spectrum in the high-redshift sample. Stellar models with super-solar

offset of the strong-line ratios of this sample from local excitation sequences

O/Fe at high redshift caused by rapid formation timescales. Given the extreme

cosmological simulation of a Milky Way-mass galaxy (from the FIRE project) with
a binary population synthesis model for low and intermediate mass stars. Our

satellite galaxies and streams. With the simulation, we show how different
galactic components contribute differently to the gravitational wave signal,
due to their typical age and distance distributions. We find that the dominant
LISA sources will be He-He systems and He-CO systems with important
contributions from the thick disk and bulge but also a few systems in the
stellar halo. The resulting sky map of the sources is different from previous
models, with important consequences for the searches for electromagnetic

magnetars born in rare core-collapse explosions, motivated by the star forming
dwarf host galaxy of the repeating FRB 121102, which is remarkably similar to
the hosts of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and long gamma-ray bursts (LGRB).
However, long-lived magnetars may also be created in binary neutron star (BNS)
mergers, in the small subset of cases with a sufficiently low total mass for
the remnant to avoid collapse to a black hole, or in the accretion-induced
collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf. A BNS FRB channel will be characterized by
distinct host galaxy and spatial offset distributions than the SLSNe/LGRB
channel; we anticipate a similar host population, although possibly different
offset distribution for AIC events. We show that both the BNS and AIC channels
are consistent with the recently reported FRB 180924, localized by ASKAP to a
massive quiescent host galaxy with an offset of about 1.4 effective radii.
Using models calibrated to FRB 121102, we make predictions for the dispersion
measure, rotation measure, and persistent radio emission from magnetar FRB
sources born in BNS mergers or AIC, and show these are consistent with upper
limits from FRB 180924 for reasonable parameters. Depending on the rate of AIC,
and the fraction of BNS mergers leaving long-lived stable magnetars, the birth
rate of repeating FRB sources associated with older stellar populations could
be comparable to that of the core-collapse channel. We also discuss potential
differences in the repetition properties of these channels, as a result of
differences in the characteristic masses and magnetic fields of the magnetars.

scheme for classical simulation of Boson Sampling under uniform
distinguishability and loss, based on the idea of sampling from distributions
where at most k photons are indistinguishable. We show that asymptotically this
scheme can provide a polynomial improvement in the runtime compared to
classically simulating idealised Boson Sampling. More significantly, we show
that in the regime considered experimentally relevant, our approach gives an
substantial improvement in runtime over other classical simulation approaches.

here a scenario based on the role of time in the low-energy regime of

Appropriate inclusion of time is our proposal to overcome well-known
geometrical obstructions to such a program, that stopped further research of
this kind. In particular, our approach is based on the realization of an exotic
$time-loop$, that could be seen as oscillating particle-hole pairs. Although
this is a theoretical paper, we moved the first steps toward testing the
realization of these scenarios, by envisaging $Gedankenexperiments$ on the
interplay between an external electromagnetic field (to excite the pair
particle-hole and realize the time-loops), and a suitable distribution of
dislocations described as torsion (responsible for the measurable holonomy in
the time-loop, hence a current). Our general analysis here establishes that we
need to move to a nonlinear response regime. We then conclude by pointing to
recent results from the interaction laser-graphene that could be used to look
for manifestations of the torsion-induced holonomy of the time-loop, e.g., as
specific patterns of suppression/generation of higher harmonics.

vectors and complex networks requires often their representation in a
geometrical space by embedding. Recent developments in machine learning and
network geometry have pointed out the hyperbolic space as a useful framework
for the representation of this data derived by real complex physical systems.
In the hyperbolic space, the radial coordinate of the nodes characterizes their
hierarchy, whereas the angular distance between them represents their
similarity. Several studies have highlighted the relationship between the
angular coordinates of the nodes embedded in the hyperbolic space and the
community metadata available. However, such analyses have been often limited to
a visual or qualitative assessment. Here, we introduce the angular separation
index (ASI), to quantitatively evaluate the separation of node network
communities or data clusters over the angular coordinates of a geometrical
space. ASI is particularly useful in the hyperbolic space - where it is
extensively tested along this study - but can be used in general for any
assessment of angular separation regardless of the adopted geometry. ASI is
proposed together with an exact test statistic based on a uniformly random null
model to assess the statistical significance of the separation. We show that
ASI allows to discover two significant phenomena in network geometry. The first
is that the increase of temperature in 2D hyperbolic network generative models,
not only reduces the network clustering but also induces a 'dimensionality
jump' of the network to dimensions higher than two. The second is that ASI can
be successfully applied to detect the intrinsic dimensionality of network
structures that grow in a hidden geometrical space.

sensitivity to variations of the training algorithm, and behavior as the amount

does not by itself inhibit formation of dense 3D crystals; all $\theta_0$ allow
formation of crystals with $\phi_{max}(\theta_0) > 0.97\phi_{cp}$. Trimers are
always able to arrange into periodic structures composed of close-packed
bilayers or trilayers of triangular-lattice planes, separated by ``gap layers''
that accomodate the incommensurability. All systems have $\phi_J$ significantly
below the monomeric value, indicating that trimers' quenched bond-length and
bond-angle constraints always act to promote jamming. $\phi_J$ varies strongly
with $\theta_0$; straight ($\theta_0 = 0$) trimers minimize $\phi_J$ while
closed ($\theta_0 = 120^\circ$) trimers maximize it. Marginally jammed states
of trimers with lower $\phi_J(\theta_0)$ exhibit quantifiably greater disorder,

undoing some of the smoothing incurred by nonlinear structure formation. In
this paper we present an analytical model for reconstruction based on the
Zeldovich approximation, which for the first time includes a complete set of
counterterms and bias terms up to quadratic order and can fit real and
redshift-space data pre- and post-reconstruction data in both Fourier and
configuration space over a wide range of scales. We compare our model to n-body
data at $z = 0$ from the {\tt DarkSky} simulation \cite{skillman14}, finding
sub-percent agreement in both real space and in the redshift-space power
spectrum monopole out to $k = 0.4\ h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and out to $k = 0.2\ h$
Mpc$^{-1}$ in the quadrupole, with comparable agreement in configuration space.
We compare our model with several popular existing alternatives, updating
existing theoretical results for exponential damping in wiggle/no-wiggle splits
of the BAO signal and discuss the usually-ignored effect of higher bias
contributions on the reconstructed signal. In the appendices, we re-derive the
former within our formalism, present exploratory results on higher-order
corrections due to nonlinearities inherent to reconstruction, and present
numerical techniques with which to calculate the redshift-space power spectrum
of biased tracers within the Zeldovich approximation.

construction of quantum networks and for quantum information processing. For
solid-state quantum emitters used as qubits, it can be achieved by photon
interference. When the emitter is subject to spectral diffusion, this process
can become highly inefficient, impeding the achievement of scalable quantum
technologies. We study two-photon interference in the context of a
Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM)-type experiment for two separate quantum emitters, with
different detunings with respect to a specific target frequency. We evaluate
the second order coherences that characterize photon indistinguishability
between the two emitters. We find that the two-photon interference operation
that is inefficient in the absence of a control protocol, when the two
detunings are different and spectral overlap is lessened, can be highly
improved by a periodic sequence of $\pi$ pulses at a set target frequency.
Photon indistinguishability in solid state and other quantum emitters subject
to spectral diffusion can thus be enhanced by the proposed pulse sequence and
similar external control protocols despite the fluctuations in the environment.

navigation, and biochemical detection. Their performance is quantified using
the quality factor $Q$, which gives the ratio of the energy stored to the
energy dissipated per cycle. Metallic glasses are a promising materials class
for micro- and nano-scale resonators since they are amorphous and can be
fabricated precisely into complex shapes on these lengthscales. To understand
the intrinsic dissipation mechanisms that ultimately limit large $Q$-values in
metallic glasses, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to model metallic
glass resonators subjected to bending vibrations. We calculate the vibrational
density of states, redistribution of energy from the fundamental mode of
vibration, and $Q$ versus the kinetic energy per atom $K$ of the excitation. In
the linear and nonlinear response regimes where there are no atomic
rearrangements, we find that $Q \rightarrow \infty$ (since we do not consider
coupling to the environment). We identify a characteristic $K_r$ above which
atomic rearrangements occur, and there is significant energy leakage from the
fundamental mode to higher frequencies, causing finite $Q$. Thus, $K_r$ is a
critical parameter determining resonator performance. We show that $K_r$
decreases as a power-law, $K_r\sim N^{-k},$ with increasing system size $N$,
where $k \approx 1.3$. We estimate the critical strain $\langle \gamma_r
\rangle \sim 10^{-8}$ for micron-sized resonators below which atomic
rearrangements do not occur, and thus large $Q$-values can be obtained when
they are operated below $\gamma_r$. We find that $K_r$ for amorphous resonators
is comparable to that for resonators with crystalline order.

doubled the number of known members at greater or equal to M9 and has uncovered
the faintest known member in M_K, which should have a mass of ~3-10 M_Jup for

indexes which are largely insensitive to regional or asymmetric modifications.
Accurate assessment of pathology-driven anatomical remodeling is a crucial step
for the diagnosis and treatment of many conditions. Deep learning approaches
have recently achieved wide success in the analysis of medical images, but they
lack interpretability in the feature extraction and decision processes. In this
work, we propose a new interpretable deep learning model for shape analysis. In
particular, we exploit deep generative networks to model a population of
anatomical segmentations through a hierarchy of conditional latent variables.
At the highest level of this hierarchy, a two-dimensional latent space is
simultaneously optimised to discriminate distinct clinical conditions, enabling
the direct visualisation of the classification space. Moreover, the anatomical
variability encoded by this discriminative latent space can be visualised in
the segmentation space thanks to the generative properties of the model, making
the classification task transparent. This approach yielded high accuracy in the
categorisation of healthy and remodelled left ventricles when tested on unseen
segmentations from our own multi-centre dataset as well as in an external
validation set, and on hippocampi from healthy controls and patients with
Alzheimer's disease when tested on ADNI data. More importantly, it enabled the
visualisation in three-dimensions of both global and regional anatomical
features which better discriminate between the conditions under exam. The
proposed approach scales effectively to large populations, facilitating
high-throughput analysis of normal anatomy and pathology in large-scale studies
of volumetric imaging.

distributed data and asynchronous events. Currently, constructing these use
cases is difficult and time-consuming; developers are forced to operationally
program low-level details like asynchronous database querying and reactive
event handling. This approach is in stark contrast to modern methods for
browser-based interactive visualization, which feature high-level declarative
specifications. In response, we present DIEL, a declarative framework that
supports asynchronous events over distributed data. Like many declarative
visualization languages, DIEL developers need only specify what data they want,
rather than procedural steps for how to assemble it; uniquely, DIEL models
asynchronous events (e.g., user interactions or server responses) as streams of
data that are captured in event logs. To specify the state of a user interface
at any time, developers author declarative queries over the data and event
logs; DIEL compiles and optimizes a corresponding dataflow graph, and
synthesizes necessary low-level distributed systems details. We demonstrate
DIEL's performance and expressivity through ex-ample interactive visualizations

nearing the maximum number of surface sites allowable, a sudden brightening of

This radiation brightening occurs only under short pulse excitation;
steady-state excitation is characterized by conventional concentration
quenching for any number of chromophores per particle. The observed suppression
of fluorescence quenching is consistent with efficient, collective relaxation
at room temperature. Interestingly, radiation brightening disappears when the
emitters' spatial and/or dynamic heterogeneity is increased, suggesting that
the template structural properties may play a role and opening a way towards
novel, virus-enabled imaging vectors that have qualitatively different optical

invertible. Most previous research using unsupervised deep neural networks for
registration have used a local smoothness constraint (typically, a spatial
variation loss) to address the smoothness issue. These networks usually produce
non-invertible transformations with ``folding'' in multiple voxel locations,
indicated by a negative determinant of the Jacobian matrix of the
transformation. While using a loss function that specifically penalizes the
folding is a straightforward solution, this usually requires carefully tuning
the regularization strength, especially when there are also other losses. In
this paper we address this problem from a different angle, by investigating
possible training mechanisms that will help the network avoid negative
Jacobians and produce smoother deformations. We contribute two independent
ideas in this direction. Both ideas greatly reduce the number of folding
locations in the predicted deformation, without making changes to the
hyperparameters or the architecture used in the existing baseline registration
network.

classification tasks of plant leaves. This network based classifier is analyzed
in two directions. In the forward direction, the proposed network can be used
in two ways: a classifier and an automatic feature extractor. As a classifier,
it takes the simple centroid contour distance curve as the single feature and
achieves comparable performance with state-of-art methods that usually require
multiple extracted features. As a feature extractor, it produces nearly linear
separable features, hence can be used together with other classifiers such as
support vector machines to provide better performance. The proposed network
adopts simple 1d input and is generally applicable for other tasks such as
classifying one dimensional time series in an end-to-end fashion without
changes. Experiments on some benchmark datasets show this architecture can
provide classification accuracies that are comparable or higher than some
existing methods. In the backward direction, methods like gradient-weighted
class activation mapping and maximum activation map of neurons in the
classification layer with respect to inputs are performed to help investigate
and further validate that hidden signatures helping trigger the trained
classifier's specific decisions can be human interpretable. Code for the paper

distributions of the two groups for scale and shape differences (including
several scale-independent measures of variability, such as Hoover index), which

(GIMCO), which is a new tomographic estimator for the gravitational lensing
potential, based on a combination of intensity mapping (IM) and galaxy number
counts. The estimator can be written schematically as
IM$(z_f)\times$galaxy$(z_b)$ $-$ galaxy$(z_f)\times$IM$(z_b)$ for a pair of
distinct redshifts $(z_f,z_b)$; this combination allows to greatly reduce the
contamination by density-density correlations, thus isolating the lensing
signal. As an estimator constructed only from cross-correlations, it is
additionally less susceptible to systematic effects. We show that the new
estimator strongly suppresses cosmic variance and consequently improves the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the detection of lensing, especially on linear
scales and intermediate redshifts. %This makes it particularly valuable for
future studies of dark energy and modified gravity. For cosmic variance
dominated surveys, the SNR of our estimator is a factor 30 larger than the SNR
obtained from the correlation of galaxy number counts only. Shot noise and
interferometer noise reduce the SNR. For the specific example of the Dark
Energy Survey (DES) cross-correlated with the Hydrogen Intensity mapping and
Real time Analysis eXperiment (HIRAX), the SNR is around 4, whereas for Euclid
cross-correlated with HIRAX it reaches 52. This corresponds to an improvement
of a factor 4-5 compared to the SNR from DES alone. For Euclid cross-correlated
with HIRAX the improvement with respect to Euclid alone strongly depends on the
redshift. We find that the improvement is particularly important for redshifts
below 1.6, where it reaches a factor of 5. This makes our estimator especially
valuable to test dark energy and modified gravity, that are expected to leave
an impact at low and intermediate redshifts.

that many of the observed properties of proximity networks emerge naturally and
simultaneously in a simple latent space network model, called
dynamic-$\mathbb{S}^{1}$. The dynamic-$\mathbb{S}^{1}$ does not model node
mobility directly, but captures the connectivity in each snapshot---each

traditional complex networks, which is isomorphic to hyperbolic geometric

analysis, allowing us to prove the contact, inter-contact and weight

thermodynamic limit with exponents lying within the ranges observed in real

one applies a finite element method to discretize in space. This is a

  We use domain decomposition to construct a family of primal hybrid finite

evaluates the layer potentials with singular, weakly or nearly singular, or

differential equations. The idea is to form a local complex polynomial or
partial wave expansion centered at a point away from the boundary to avoid the
singularity in the integrand, and then extrapolate the expansion at points near
or even exactly on the boundary. In this paper, in addition to the local
complex Taylor polynomial expansion, we derive new representations of the
Laplace layer potentials using both the local complex polynomial and plane wave
expansions. Unlike in the QBX, the local complex polynomial expansion in the
new quadrature by two expansions (QB2X) method only collects the far-field
contributions and its number of expansion terms can be analyzed using tools
from the classical fast multipole method. The plane wave type expansion in the
QB2X method better captures the layer potential features near the boundary. It
is derived by applying the Fourier extension technique to the density and
boundary geometry functions and then analytically utilizing the Residue Theorem
for complex contour integrals. The internal connections of the layer potential

tertiary companions, but each exhibits two eclipses along with at least one
spectroscopically varying component (KIC 6449358, KIC 6131659, and KIC

estimate temperatures of both members of these SEBs. We explore evolutionary
histories in H-R diagram space and estimate ages for this subset of our sample.
Finally, we consider the implications for the formation pathways of close
binary systems via interactions with tertiary companions. Our methodology
combined with the era of big data and observation overlap opens up the

increased on modern high performance computing resources but acceleration of
the analysis of the output trajectories has lagged behind so that analyzing
simulations is becoming a bottleneck. To close this gap, we studied the
performance of parallel trajectory analysis with MPI and the Python MDAnalysis
library on three different XSEDE supercomputers where trajectories were read
from a Lustre parallel file system. Strong scaling performance was impeded by
stragglers, MPI processes that were slower than the typical process. Stragglers
were less prevalent for compute-bound workloads, thus pointing to file reading
as a bottleneck for scaling. However, a more complicated picture emerged in
which both the computation and the data ingestion exhibited close to ideal
strong scaling behavior whereas stragglers were primarily caused by either
large MPI communication costs or long times to open the single shared
trajectory file. We improved overall strong scaling performance by either
subfiling (splitting the trajectory into separate files) or MPI-IO with
Parallel HDF5 trajectory files. The parallel HDF5 approach resulted in near
ideal strong scaling on up to 384 cores (16 nodes), thus reducing trajectory
analysis times by two orders of magnitude compared to the serial approach.

we study the maximum safe radius problem, which computes the minimum distance
from the optical flow sequence obtained from a given input to that of an
adversarial example in the neighbourhood of the input. We demonstrate that,
under the assumption of Lipschitz continuity, the problem can be approximated
using finite optimisation via discretising the optical flow space, and the
approximation has provable guarantees. We then show that the finite
optimisation problem can be solved by utilising a two-player turn-based game in
a cooperative setting, where the first player selects the optical flows and the
second player determines the dimensions to be manipulated in the chosen flow.
We employ an anytime approach to solve the game, in the sense of approximating
the value of the game by monotonically improving its upper and lower bounds. We
exploit a gradient-based search algorithm to compute the upper bounds, and the
admissible A* algorithm to update the lower bounds. Finally, we evaluate our

the photon wind, imparts a drag force $v B(v, T, \rho)$ on the dislocation. In
early studies the drag coefficient $B$ was computed and experimentally
determined only for dislocation velocities $v$ much less than transverse sound
speed, $c_t$. In this paper we derive analytic expressions for the velocity
dependence of $B$ up to $c_t$ in terms of the third-order continuum elastic
constants of an isotropic crystal, in the continuum Debye approximation, valid
for dislocation velocities approaching the sound speed. In so doing we point
out that the most general form of the third order elastic potential for such a
crystal and the dislocation-phonon interaction requires two additional elastic
constants involving asymmetric local rotational strains, which have been
neglected previously. We compute the velocity dependence of the transverse
phonon wind contribution to $B$ in the range 1%-90% $c_t$ for Al, Cu, Fe, and
Nb in the isotropic Debye approximation. The drag coefficient for transverse
phonons scattering from screw dislocations is finite as $v \rightarrow c_t$,
whereas $B$ is divergent for transverse phonons scattering from edge
dislocations in the same limit. This divergence indicates the breakdown of the
Debye approximation and sensitivity of the drag coefficient at very high
velocities to the microscopic crystalline lattice cutoff. We compare our
results to experimental results wherever possible and identify ways to validate
and further improve the theory of dislocation drag at high velocities with
realistic phonon dispersion relations, inclusion of lattice cutoff effects, MD
simulation data, and more accurate experimental measurements.

tradeoff that is captured by the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework. This
framework has been studied and applied, typically when at each time period
feedback is received only on the action that was selected at that period.
However, in many practical settings additional data may become available
between decision epochs. We introduce a generalized MAB formulation, which
considers a broad class of distributions that are informative about mean
rewards, and allows observations from these distributions to arrive according
to an arbitrary and a priori unknown arrival process. When it is known how to
map auxiliary data to reward estimates, by obtaining matching lower and upper
bounds we characterize a spectrum of minimax complexities for this class of
problems as a function of the information arrival process, which captures how
salient characteristics of this process impact achievable performance. In terms
of achieving optimal performance, we establish that upper confidence bound and
posterior sampling policies possess natural robustness with respect to the
information arrival process without any adjustments, which uncovers a novel
property of these popular policies and further lends credence to their appeal.
When the mappings connecting auxiliary data and rewards are a priori unknown,
we characterize necessary and sufficient conditions under which auxiliary
information allows performance improvement. We devise a new policy that is
based on two different upper confidence bounds (one that accounts for auxiliary
observation and one that does not) and establish the near-optimality of this
policy. We use data from a large media site to analyze the value that may be
captured in practice by leveraging auxiliary data for designing content

addresses these challenges by introducing SetGAN, an adversarial architecture

part manufacturing system based on intrinsic geometrical properties of the
parts, estimated from three-dimensional sensor data. An intrinsic method has
the computational advantage of avoiding the difficult part registration
problem, necessary in previous SPC approaches of three-dimensional geometrical
data, but inadequate if noncontact sensors are used. The approach estimates the
spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator of the scanned parts and uses a
multivariate nonparametric control chart for online process control. Our
proposal brings SPC closer to computer vision and computer graphics methods
aimed to detect large differences in shape (but not in size). However, the SPC
problem differs in that small changes in either shape or size of the parts need
to be detected, keeping a controllable false alarm rate and without completely
filtering noise. An online or ""Phase II"" method and a scheme for starting up in
the absence of prior data (""Phase I"") are presented. Comparison with earlier
approaches that require registration shows the LB spectrum method to be more
sensitive to rapidly detect small changes in shape and size, including the
practical case when the sequence of part datasets is in the form of large,
unequal size meshes. A post-alarm diagnostic method to investigate the location
of defects on the surface of a part is also presented. While we focus in this
article on surface (triangulation) data, the methods can also be applied to
point cloud and voxel metrology data.

nonconvex approach with rank constraint. We explicitly derive the statistical
rates of both estimators in terms of the Kullback-Leiber divergence and the
$\ell_2$ error and also establish a minimax lower bound to assess the tightness
of these rates. For computing the nonconvex estimator, we develop a novel DC

of these stars from different surveys has allowed us to make meaningful

like surface chemical composition, temperature and gravity of isolated white
dwarfs can be inferred from spectroscopy, and the total mass and radius can be
derived as well when they are in binaries, the internal structure of these
compact stars can be unveiled only by means of asteroseismology, an approach
based on the comparison between the observed pulsation periods of variable
stars and the periods predicted by appropriate theoretical models. The
asteroseismological techniques allow us to infer details of the internal
chemical stratification, the total mass, and even the stellar rotation profile.

arising in many contexts and applications that has been the subject of dozens
of papers in the literature. In this problem we are given a general weighted
graph where each edge is labeled positive or negative. The goal is to obtain a
partitioning (clustering) of the vertices that minimizes disagreements - weight
of negative edges trapped inside a cluster plus positive edges between
different clusters. Most of the papers on this topic mainly focus on minimizing
total disagreement, a global objective for this problem. In this paper, we
study a cluster-wise objective function that asks to minimize the maximum
number of disagreements of each cluster, which we call min-max correlation
clustering. The min-max objective is a natural objective that respects the
quality of every cluster. In this paper, we provide the first nontrivial
approximation algorithm for this problem achieving an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log
n\cdot\max\{\log(|E^-|),\log(k)\}})$ approximation for general weighted graphs,
where $|E^-|$ denotes the number of negative edges and $k$ is the number of
clusters in the optimum solution. To do so, we also obtain a corresponding
result for multicut where we wish to find a multicut solution while trying to
minimize the total weight of cut edges on every component. The results are then
further improved to obtain (i) $\mathcal{O}(r^2)$-approximation for min-max
correlation clustering and min-max multicut for graphs that exclude $K_{r,r}$

too obvious to arouse users' interest. That's why the recommender systems
research community has advocated some ""beyond accuracy"" evaluation metrics such
as novelty, diversity, coverage, and serendipity with the hope of promoting
information discovery and sustain users' interest over a long period of time.
While bringing in new perspectives, most of these evaluation metrics have not
considered individual users' difference: an open-minded user may favor highly
novel or diversified recommendations whereas a conservative user's appetite for
novelty or diversity may not be that large. In this paper, we developed a model
to approximate an individual's curiosity distribution over different levels of
stimuli guided by the well-known Wundt curve in Psychology. We measured an
item's surprise level to assess the stimulation level and whether it is in the
range of the user's appetite for stimulus. We then proposed a recommendation
system framework that considers both user preference and appetite for stimulus
where the curiosity is maximally aroused. Our framework differs from a typical
recommender system in that it leverages human's curiosity to promote intrinsic
interest with the system. A series of evaluation experiments have been
conducted to show that our framework is able to rank higher the items with not
only high ratings but also high response likelihood. The recommendation list
generated by our algorithm has higher potential of inspiring user curiosity
compared to traditional approaches. The personalization factor for assessing
the stimulus (surprise) strength further helps the recommender achieve smaller

intervals of large size. Away from periodic boundary conditions, our numerical
results show that the ground state has a generic crystal-like structure that
can be modulated by variations of the boundary conditions. The results
presented here could be relevant for experimental implementations of nonlinear

However, to link the Lynx central galaxies to brightest cluster galaxies
similar to those of low redshift clusters, the Lynx galaxies would have to grow
by at least a factor five, possibly through major merging. The mass-to-light
ratios and the Balmer absorption lines of the Lynx galaxies are consistent with
passive evolution of the stellar populations from z=1.27 to the present and
support ages of 1--3 Gyr. The galaxies in the outskirts of the clusters contain
younger stellar populations than found in the cluster cores. However, when
evolved passively to z~0 both populations are consistent with the observed
populations in the Coma cluster galaxies. The bulge-dominated emission line

classification scheme for the shape of such bow shocks, which we here apply to
three very different observational datasets: mid-infrared arcs around hot OB
stars; far-infrared arcs around luminous cool stars; and H alpha emission-line
arcs around proplyds and other young stars in the Orion Nebula. For OB stars,
the average shape is consistent with simple thin-shell models for the
interaction of a spherical wind with a parallel stream, but the diversity of
observed shapes is many times larger than such models predict. We propose that
this may be caused by time-dependent oscillations in the bow shocks, due to
either instabilities or wind variability. Cool star bow shocks have markedly
more closed wings than hot star bow shocks, which may be due to the dust
emission arising in the shocked stellar wind instead of the shocked
interstellar medium. The Orion Nebula arcs, on the other hand, have both
significantly more open wings and significantly flatter apexes than the hot
star bow shocks. We test several possible explanations for this difference
(divergent ambient stream, low Mach number, observational biases, and influence
of collimated jets), but the evidence for each is inconclusive.

issues related to home automation and developed approaches to address them.
Such approaches often face design and evaluation challenges which arise from
their restricted perspective of home automation that is bounded by the IoT apps
they analyze. The challenges of past work can be overcome by relying on a
deeper understanding of realistic home automation usage. More specifically, the
availability of natural home automation scenarios, i.e., sequences of home
automation events that may realistically occur in an end-user's home, could
help security researchers design better security/safety systems. This paper
presents Helion, a framework for building a natural perspective of home
automation. Helion identifies the regularities in user-driven home automation,
i.e., from user-driven routines that are increasingly being created by users
through intuitive platform UIs. Our intuition for designing Helion is that
smart home event sequences created by users exhibit an inherent set of semantic
patterns, or naturalness that can be modeled and used to generate valid and
useful scenarios. To evaluate our approach, we first empirically demonstrate
that this naturalness hypothesis holds, with a corpus of 30,518 home automation
events, constructed from 273 routines collected from 40 users. We then
demonstrate that the scenarios generated by Helion are reasonable and valid
from an end-user perspective, through an evaluation with 16 external
evaluators. We further show the usefulness of Helion's scenarios by generating
17 home security/safety policies with significantly less effort than existing
approaches. We conclude by discussing key takeaways and future research
challenges enabled by Helion's natural perspective of home automation.

versus applied magnetic field is carried out from 100 K to 320 K in magnetic
fields up to 4 kOe to determine changes in the magnetic entropy ($-\Delta S_M$)
and the relative cooling power (RCP). Due to the co-existence of SPM and FM
phases, there are two peaks in the temperature dependence of$-\Delta S_M$ in
different applied magnetic fields from 1.3 kOe to 4 kOe. The peaks are at 220 K
and 270 K which are close $T_B$ and $T_C$ of the film. The highest RCP occurs
at 270 K (which is in $T_B$ $\mathrm{<}$ $T$ $\mathrm{<}$ $T_C$) in H = 4 kOe
with the value of 0.19 (J/kg K). The $-\Delta S_M$ vs T data are fit to the
exponent power law, $-\Delta S_M=a H^n$ where it shows good fits for the whole

proposes a novel bottom-up interactive fusion structure to model the

progressively aggregates modality-specific features from the encoders but also
computes complementary features for them. To instantiate this structure, the
paper proposes a residual fusion block (RFB) to formulate the interdependences

conducted measurements in magnetic fields up to 30~T, observing distinctly
different behaviors between semimetallic ($x < 0.07$) and topological insulator

eventually saturating at high fields ($>$20~T). Ellipticity spectra for the

showed no detectable ellipticity. To explain these observations, we developed a

can also write its update rules in a closed form, and its computational cost is
lower than that of ALS. ACBMF is proposed to compensate a disadvantage of CBMF
in terms of relatively high memory cost. We experimentally illustrate that the
proposed methods outperform the two existing algorithms in terms of convergence
speed per iteration, and it can work under the condition where observed entries

the design of a collaborative label partitioning scheme across multiple nodes

close agreement with the experimental observations, thus supporting the

$0.20^{+0.13}_{-0.10}$. This mass fraction weakly varies with mass and mass
surface density of clouds, and shows no clear dependence on the virial

weakly dependent upon Galactocentric radius. Although the scatter in our

measuring the mass content, scale radius and shape of a flattened dwarf

dwarf spheroidal galaxies and their host halos are spherical. We use an Evans
model (1993) to construct an isothermal mock galaxy whose properties somewhat
resemble those of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. This mock galaxy
contains flattened luminous and dark matter components, resulting in a
logarithmic profile for the global potential. We have tested how well our
Schwarzschild method could constrain the characteristic parameters of the
system for different sample sizes, and also if the functional form of the
potential was unknown. When assuming the true functional form of the potential,
the Schwarzschild modelling technique is able to provide an accurate and
precise measurement of the characteristic mass parameter of the system and
reproduces well the light distribution and the stellar kinematics of our mock
galaxy. When assuming a different functional form for the potential, such as a
flattened NFW profile, we also constrain the mass and scale radius to their
expected values. However in both cases, we find that the flattening parameter
remains largely unconstrained. This is likely because the information content
of the velocity dispersion on the geometric shape of the potential is too
small, since $\sigma$ is constant across our mock dSph. Our results using
Schwarzschild's method indicate that the mass enclosed can be derived reliably,
even if the flattening parameter is unknown, and already for samples containing
2000 line-of-sight radial velocities, such as those currently available.
Further applications of the method to more general distribution functions of
flattened systems are needed to establish how well the flattening of dSph dark
halos can be determined.

a two-level system with only longitudinal field (detuning) control, while the
transverse field is kept constant. The suggested method is a modification of
the Roland-Cerf protocol, during which the parameter quantifying local
adiabaticity is held constant. Here, we show that with a simple ``on-off""
modulation of this local adiabaticity parameter, a perfect adiabatic passage
can be obtained for every duration larger than the lower bound $\pi/\Omega$,
where $\Omega$ is the constant transverse field. For a fixed maximum amplitude
of the local adiabaticity parameter, the timings of the ``on-off""
pulse-sequence which achieves perfect fidelity in minimum time are obtained
using optimal control theory. The corresponding detuning control is continuous
and monotonic, a significant advantage compared to the detuning variation at
the quantum speed limit which includes non-monotonic jumps. The proposed
methodology can be applied in several important core tasks in quantum
computing, for example to the design of a high fidelity controlled-phase gate,
which can be mapped to the adiabatic quantum control of such a qubit.
Additionally, it is expected to find applications across all Physics
disciplines which exploit the adiabatic control of such a two-level system.

stable schemes for gradient systems. The Camassa-Holm equation is first
reformulated into an equivalent system by utilizing the multiple scalar
auxiliary variables approach, which inherits a modified energy. Then, the
system is discretized in space aided by the standard Fourier pseudo-spectral
method and a semi-discrete system is obtained, which is proven to preserve a
semi-discrete modified energy. Subsequently, the linearized Crank-Nicolson
method is applied for the resulting semi-discrete system to arrive at a fully
discrete scheme. The main feature of the new scheme is to form a linear system
with a constant coefficient matrix at each time step and produce numerical
solutions along which the modified energy is precisely conserved, as is the
case with the analytical solution. Several numerical results are addressed to
confirm accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme.

rapidity distributions of charged particles and transverse mass spectra of
multi-particle production have been built. The comparison of multiple
histograms with the expectations of the Quark-Gluon String Model (QGSM) gives
us, at first sight, the conclusion that it might be the carbon-nucleus
collision with the matter of atmosphere at the c.m.s. equivalent energy
$\sqrt{s} \ge $ 5 TeV. Nevertheless, the data indicate the features that cannot
be associated with nucleus-nucleus collision: one particle with transverse mass
16 GeV was detected and a small nucleon population has been seen in the region
of projectile fragmentation that does not correspond to the carbon nucleus
collision. Both facts make us convinced that there might be a baryonic DM decay
(Piskounova O., 2018). Baryonic DM particles are to be formed at the huge
gravitation pressure in giant massive objects like Black Holes. Relativistic
jets are spreading the baryonic DM in space. The important difference between
this form of matter and the ordinary nucleus lies in the results of collision:
baryonic DM is the object, where protons and antiprotons are strongly
connected, so the energy is divided between nucleon components due to the
structure function of Regge type, like for quarks in the proton. The lightest
debris of baryonic DM particle interacts with the greatest maximal rapidity and
gives the small number of nucleons in the forwarding part of spectra. Baryonic
DM can also split into the pair of similar DM with lower mass giving an unusual
couple of hadrons with mass like 14 GeV and heavier.

data distribution and learning objective changes through time, or where all the
training data and objective criteria are never available at once. The evolution
of the learning process is modeled by a sequence of learning experiences where
the goal is to be able to learn new skills all along the sequence without
forgetting what has been previously learned. Continual learning also aims at
the same time at optimizing the memory, the computation power and the speed
during the learning process.
  An important challenge for machine learning is not necessarily finding
solutions that work in the real world but rather finding stable algorithms that
can learn in real world. Hence, the ideal approach would be tackling the real
world in a embodied platform: an autonomous agent. Continual learning would
then be effective in an autonomous agent or robot, which would learn
autonomously through time about the external world, and incrementally develop a
set of complex skills and knowledge.
  Robotic agents have to learn to adapt and interact with their environment
using a continuous stream of observations. Some recent approaches aim at
tackling continual learning for robotics, but most recent papers on continual
learning only experiment approaches in simulation or with static datasets.
Unfortunately, the evaluation of those algorithms does not provide insights on
whether their solutions may help continual learning in the context of robotics.
This paper aims at reviewing the existing state of the art of continual
learning, summarizing existing benchmarks and metrics, and proposing a
framework for presenting and evaluating both robotics and non robotics
approaches in a way that makes transfer between both fields easier.

having a solution for the correlated many-body wavefunctions, this provides a
natural framework to many-body wavefunction theories such as the configuration
interaction and the coupled cluster method in the formal theoretical framework
of DFT. Employing simple one-dimensional two-electron systems -- namely, the
one-dimensional helium atom, hydrogen molecule and heteronuclear diatomic
molecule -- we investigate properties of many-body wavefunctions and exact
exchange-correlation potentials of effectively-interacting Kohn-Sham systems.
As a result, we find that the asymptotic behavior of the exact
exchange-correlation potential can be controlled by optimizing that of the
effective interaction. Furthermore, the typical features of the exact
non-interacting Kohn-Sham system, namely a spiky feature and a step feature in
the exchange-correlation potential for the molecular dissociation limit can be
suppressed by a proper choice of the effective interaction. These findings open

translation, most sequence-to-sequence models made use of attention mechanisms
[2, 3, 4]. While they produce soft-alignment matrices that could be interpreted
as alignment between target and source languages, we lack metrics to quantify
their quality, being unclear which approach produces the best alignments. This
paper presents an empirical evaluation of 3 main sequence-to-sequence models
(CNN, RNN and Transformer-based) for word discovery from unsegmented phoneme
sequences. This task consists in aligning word sequences in a source language
with phoneme sequences in a target language, inferring from it word
segmentation on the target side [5]. Evaluating word segmentation quality can
be seen as an extrinsic evaluation of the soft-alignment matrices produced
during training. Our experiments in a low-resource scenario on Mboshi and
English languages (both aligned to French) show that RNNs surprisingly
outperform CNNs and Transformer for this task. Our results are confirmed by an
intrinsic evaluation of alignment quality through the use of Average Normalized
Entropy (ANE). Lastly, we improve our best word discovery model by using an
alignment entropy confidence measure that accumulates ANE over all the
occurrences of a given alignment pair in the collection.

this paper systematically analyzes the distribution of p-values of primary

the classical 5% threshold for statistical significance. Second, a density
discontinuity test reveals an upward jump at the 5% threshold for phase III
results by small industry sponsors. Third, we document a larger fraction of
significant results in phase III compared to phase II. Linking trials across
phases, we find that early favorable results increase the likelihood of
continuing into the next phase. Once we take into account this selective
continuation, we can explain almost completely the excess of significant
results in phase III for trials conducted by large industry sponsors. For small
industry sponsors, instead, part of the excess remains unexplained.

organizations be more prepared to prevent, mitigate or investigate future

sharing of knowledge about CPS incidents across different organizations. To
support sharing, we represent incident knowledge (incident patterns) capturing
incident characteristics that can manifest again, such as incident activities

abstract representation of specific incident instances and, thus, are general
enough to be applicable to various systems - different than the one in which
the incident occurred. They can also avoid disclosing potentially sensitive
information about an organization's assets and resources. We provide an
automated technique to extract an incident pattern from a specific incident

cyber-physical systems, we also provide an automated technique to instantiate
incident patterns to specific systems. We demonstrate the feasibility of our
approach in the application domain of smart buildings. We evaluate correctness,

helpful both to predict and to examine their frequency spectra, as well as to
make the link with their internal properties. In this short paper, we introduce
a general quantization expression for oscillation modes accounting for the
possible existence of a local sharp variation in the equilibrium structure, a
so-called glitch. This representation is based on a direct adaptation of the
progressive-wave picture of mixed modes proposed by Takata (2016b). In this
formulation, a glitch turns out to be characterized by three parameters: its
acoustic depth, the phase lags introduced after the wave reflection at the
considered point, and a coupling factor. Such an expression has two main
advantages. First, it can be easily applicable to a lot of different structural
configurations. Second, it does not assume that the glitch is a small
perturbation. Actually, we check that the obtained expression tends to the
formulations previously derived when the glitch is weak. These research notes
represent a preliminary step towards a more generalized description of
multi-cavity oscillation modes, that was briefly addressed in the poster

used for inexact graph matching. Since its exact computation is NP-hard,
heuristics are used in practice. A popular approach is to obtain upper bounds
for GED via transformations to the linear sum assignment problem with
error-correction (LSAPE). Typically, local structures and distances between
them are employed for carrying out this transformation, but recently also
machine learning techniques have been used. In this paper, we formally define a
unifying framework LSAPE-GED for transformations from GED to LSAPE. We also
introduce rings, a new kind of local structures designed for graphs where most
information resides in the topology rather than in the node labels.
Furthermore, we propose two new ring based heuristics RING and RING-ML, which
instantiate LSAPE-GED using the traditional and the machine learning based
approach for transforming GED to LSAPE, respectively. Extensive experiments
show that using rings for upper bounding GED significantly improves the state
of the art on datasets where most information resides in the graphs'
topologies. This closes the gap between fast but rather inaccurate LSAPE based
heuristics and more accurate but significantly slower GED algorithms based on
local search.

star formation rate and metallicity. The presence of detected X-ray sources
within the galaxies is found to correlate with the ratio of the star formation
rate estimated from the near-ultraviolet flux to that estimated from the
infrared. This implies reduced obscuration due to dust in the galaxies with
X-ray sources. These results support the idea that X-ray binaries may be an
important part of the process of reionziation.

character of pinning of the charge density wave (CDW) by these defects. A
number of fundamental differences from pinning by ordinary local pinning
centers - impurities and point defects - have been found. We conclude that
quenching defects are extended (non-local) objects (presumably, dislocations)
that can diffuse from the crystal during low-temperature termocycling due to
their strong interaction with the CDW, which is intrinsic for the Peierls
conductors. The presence of these defects leads to a previously unknown
non-local type of CDW pinning that acts on $T_P$ and the threshold field for
the onset of the CDW sliding, $E_T$, differently in comparison with the local

a Dirichlet wall placed in the asymptotically flat space. The phase structures
and transitions of these two types of BI black holes, namely BI-AdS black holes
and BI black holes in a cavity, are investigated in a grand canonical ensemble,
where the temperature and the potential are fixed. For BI-AdS black holes, the
globally stable phases can be the thermal AdS space. For small values of the
potential, there is a Hawking-Page-like first order phase transition between
the BI-AdS black holes and the thermal-AdS space. However, the phase transition
becomes zeroth order when the values of the potential are large enough. For BI
black holes in a cavity, the globally stable phases can be a naked singularity
or an extremal black hole with the horizon merging with the wall, which both
are on the boundaries of the physical parameter region. The thermal flat space
is never globally preferred. Besides a first order phase transition, there is a
second order phase transition between the globally stable phases. Thus, it
shows that the phase structures and transitions of BI black holes with these
two different boundary conditions have several dissimilarities.

and mechanisms of multistability in microbial communities. Here we introduce
and study a resource-explicit model in which microbes compete for two types of
essential nutrients. We adapt game-theoretical methods of the stable matching
problem to identify all possible species compositions of a microbial community.
We then classify them by their resilience against three types of perturbations:
fluctuations in nutrient supply, invasions by new species, and small changes of
abundances of existing ones. We observe multistability and explore an intricate
network of regime shifts between stable states in our model. Our results
suggest that multistability requires microbial species to have different
stoichiometries of essential nutrients. We also find that balanced nutrient
supply promote multistability and species diversity yet make individual
community states less stable.

been studied based on the cold-fluid hydrodynamic description. As a result, the
necessary conditions under resonant amplification of the beam's natural
oscillations are identified. Present results demonstrate that the beam density
increases when the amplitude of radial and axial velocities increase. This
process decreases the radius of the beam over the course of time. The technical
application of the process applies in real accelerators such as a gyrotrons,
FELs, and cyclotrons, where transverse size is limited by the size of the
vacuum chamber. Thus redistribution of energy between the external field and
the kinetic energy of the beam can effectively accelerate the beam by using an
external magnetic field. These fields with both axial and radial directions use
further this beam as an effective light source by identifying the resonance
frequency to improve stability, focus particles, and wave propagation.

predicting results, is inherently difficult to understand and can suffer from
misinterpretation. Entropic Dynamics is an epistemic approach to quantum
mechanics based on logical inference. It incorporates the probabilities that
naturally arise in situations where there is missing information. The
development of Entropic Dynamics involves describing a particle in terms of a
probability density, and then following the time evolution of the probability
density based on diffusion-like motion and maximization of entropy. Here we
will apply Entropic Dynamics to several of the paradigmatic examples used in
the instruction of quantum mechanics. These examples include wave packet
expansion, interference, the double slit experiment, the harmonic oscillator,
and entanglement. In the section on the double slit experiment, some
interesting insight is gained concerning the occurrence of minima in the
absence of a mechanism for destructive interference, since probabilities only
add. Also, the section on the harmonic oscillator provides interesting insight
into rotation and angular momentum as it pertains to the flow of probability.
The last topic consists of some remarks concerning the state of education
research as it pertains to quantum mechanics and the ways in which Entropic
Dynamics might address them.

consisting of a finite number of particles, is characterized by an exponential
spreading of wave packets in the many-body Hilbert space. This happens when the
inter-particle interaction is strong enough, thus resulting in a chaotic
structure of the many-body eigenstates considered in an unperturbed basis. The
semi-analytical approach used here, allows one to estimate the rate of the
exponential growth as well as the relaxation time, after which the
equilibration (thermalization) emerges. The key ingredient parameter in the
description of this process is the width $\Gamma$ of the Local Density of
States (LDoS) defined by the initially excited state, the number of particles
and the interaction strength. In this paper we show that apart from the meaning
of $\Gamma$ as the decay rate of survival probability, the width of the LDoS is
directly related to the diagonal entropy and the latter can be linked to the
thermodynamic entropy of a system equilibrium state emerging after the complete
relaxation. The analytical expression relating the two entropies is derived
phenomenologically and numerically confirmed in a model of bosons with random
two-body interaction, as well as in a deterministic model which becomes
completely integrable in the continuous limit.

we propose to modify the traditional system by including an optical element
called coded aperture which modulates the diffracted field to acquire coded
diffraction patterns (CDP). For the proposed coded system, in contrast with the
traditional, we derive exact reconstruction guarantees for the crystalline
structure from CDP (up to a global shift phase). Additionally, exploiting the
fact that the crystalline structure can be sparsely represented in the Fourier
domain, we develop an algorithm to estimate the crystal structure from CDP. We
show that this method requires 50% fewer measurements to estimate the crystal
structure in comparison with its competitive alternatives. Specifically, the
proposed method is able to reduce the exposition time of the crystal, implying
that under the proposed setup, its structural integrity is less affected in

Cauchy stress and the couple stress are symmetric conjugated with the symmetric

measures are asymmetric conjugated with the asymmetric relative strain
measures. This modified micromorphic model considers a continuum material point
as a granular volume element whose deformation behavior is influenced by the
translation and the rotation of particles. And this study proposes that the
microscopic actual motion is decomposed into a macroscopic motion and a
fluctuation between the macro-micro motion. Based on this decomposition, the
micromorphic constitutive relationships are derived for granular materials. In
the constitutive relationships, the macroscopic constitutive relationships are
first-order because of the introduce of the independent rotation of particle
instead of the second-order micro-deformation gradient. Furthermore, the
complex constitutive moduli in the micromorphic model are obtained in the
expressions of the microstructural information such as the contact stiffness
