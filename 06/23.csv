geo-information systems with a new conception based on network proximity.
Geo-information systems have attracted great attention and demonstrated big
progress in recent times, especially for mobile services. We can point out many
objective reasons for this. On the one hand, users require services, mainly at
their location, and on the other hand, location determination has become easy,
especially due to the proliferation of smartphones. But at the same time, the
actual geo-calculation are not needed by most of these services. For the
majority of geo-services, geo-coordinates are used only for searching and
organizing data. And the meaning of the service is to search for information
tied to the current location of the requesting party. In other words, in most
cases, service refers to data near the current location. So, our idea is to
build services directly on assessing to proximity and completely bypass
geo-calculations. It also opens the way for completely new services that were
impossible or difficult to implement with geo-computations.

However, finding solutions
of Maxwell's equations is an extremely difficult task. Therefore, various
simplifying approaches are often used in optics. One such simplifying approach
is to use the approximation of geometric optics. The approximation of geometric
optics is constructed with the assumption that the wavelengths are small
(short-wavelength approximation). The basis of geometric optics is the eikonal
equation. The eikonal equation can be obtained from the wave equation
(Helmholtz equation). Thus, the eikonal equation relates the wave and geometric
optics. In fact, the eikonal equation is a quasi-classical approximation (the
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method) of wave optics. This paper shows the
application of geometric methods of electrodynamics to the calculation of
optical devices, such as Maxwell and Luneburg lenses. The eikonal equation,
which was transformed to the ODE system by the method of characteristics, is
considered. The resulting system is written for the case of Maxwell and
Luneburg lenses.

formulate nonparametric density estimation on a network as a nonparametric
regression problem by binning. Nonparametric regression using local polynomial
kernel-weighted least squares have been studied rigorously, and its asymptotic
properties make it superior to kernel estimators such as the Nadaraya-Watson
estimator. When applied to a network, the best estimator near a vertex depends
on the amount of smoothness at the vertex. Often, there are no compelling
reasons to assume that a density will be continuous or discontinuous at a
vertex, hence a data driven approach is proposed. To estimate the density in a
neighborhood of a vertex, we propose a two-step procedure. The first step of
this pretest estimator fits a separate local polynomial regression on each edge
using data only on that edge, and then tests for equality of the estimates at
the vertex. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, then the second step
re-estimates the regression function in a small neighborhood of the vertex,
subject to a joint equality constraint. Since the derivative of the density may
be discontinuous at the vertex, we propose a piecewise polynomial local
regression estimate to model the change in slope. We study in detail the
special case of local piecewise linear regression and derive the leading bias
and variance terms using weighted least squares theory. We show that the
proposed approach will remove the bias near a vertex that has been noted for
existing methods, which typically do not allow for discontinuity at vertices.
For a fixed network, the proposed method scales sub-linearly with sample size
and it can be extended to regression and varying coefficient models on a
network. We demonstrate the workings of the proposed model by simulation
studies and apply it to a dendrite network data set.

proposed as a middle-ground between model-based and model-free reinforcement
learning strategies, allowing for fast value computation and rapid adaptation

suggest that features of neural responses are consistent with the SR framework.
However, it is not clear how such representations might be learned and computed

propose an algorithm that computes a provably feasible path from an initial
operating point to a desired operating point. Given an initial feasible point,
the algorithm solves a sequence of convex quadratically constrained
optimization problems over conservative convex inner approximations of the OPF
feasible space. In each iteration, we obtain a new, improved operating point

In addition to computing a feasible path to a known desired operating point,
this algorithm can also be used to improve the operating point locally.
Extensive numerical studies on a variety of test cases demonstrate the
algorithm and the ability to arrive at a high-quality solution in few

been argued that these externalities create incentives to under-invest in
security, this presumption is challenged by the possibility of strategic
adversaries that attack the least protected agents. In this paper we study a
new model of security games in which agents share tokens of sensitive
information in a network of contacts. The agents have the opportunity to invest
in security to protect against an attack that can be either strategically or
randomly targeted. We show that, in the presence of random attack,
under-investments always prevail at the Nash equilibrium in comparison with the
social optimum. Instead, when the attack is strategic, either under-investments
or over-investments are possible, depending on the network topology and on the
characteristics of the process of the spreading of information. Actually,
agents invest more in security than socially optimal when dependencies among
agents are low (which can happen because the information network is sparsely
connected or because the probability that information tokens are shared is
small). These over-investments pass on to under-investments when information
sharing is more likely (and therefore, when the risk brought by the attack is

reconfigurable intelligent surfaces can effectively control the wavefront,

vigorous research due to the important role of the phenomenon in climate
dynamics and its worldwide socioeconomic impacts. Over the past decades,
numerous models for ENSO prediction have been developed, among which
statistical models approximating ENSO evolution by linear dynamics have
received significant attention owing to their simplicity and comparable
forecast skill to first-principles models at short lead times. Yet, due to
highly nonlinear and chaotic dynamics (particularly during ENSO initiation),
such models have limited skill for longer-term forecasts beyond half a year. To
resolve this limitation, here we employ a new nonparametric statistical
approach based on analog forecasting, called kernel analog forecasting (KAF),
which avoids assumptions on the underlying dynamics through the use of for
nonlinear kernel methods for machine learning and dimension reduction of
high-dimensional datasets. Through a rigorous connection with Koopman operator
theory for dynamical systems, KAF yields statistically optimal predictions of
future ENSO states as conditional expectations, given noisy and potentially
incomplete data at forecast initialization. Here, using industrial-era
Indo-Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) as training data, the method is
shown to successfully predict the Nino 3.4 index in a 1998-2017 verification
period out to a 10-month lead, which corresponds to an increase of 3-7 months
over a benchmark linear inverse model (LIM), while significantly improving upon
the ENSO predictability ""spring barrier"". An analysis of a 1300-yr control
integration of a comprehensive climate model (CCSM4) further demonstrates that
the enhanced predictability afforded by KAF holds over potentially much longer
leads, extending to 24 months versus 18 months in the benchmark LIM.

machine-type communications with non-orthogonal signatures using the
approximate message passing algorithm. This paper compares two network
architectures, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and cooperative
MIMO, in terms of their effectiveness in overcoming inter-cell interference. In
the massive MIMO architecture, each base station (BS) detects only the users
from its own cell while treating inter-cell interference as noise. In the
cooperative MIMO architecture, each BS detects the users from neighboring cells
as well; the detection results are then forwarded in the form of log-likelihood
ratio (LLR) to a central unit where final decisions are made. This paper
analytically characterizes the probabilities of false alarm and missed
detection for both architectures. Numerical results validate the analytic
characterization and show that as the number of antennas increases, a massive
MIMO system effectively drives the detection error to zero, while as the
cooperation size increases, the cooperative MIMO architecture mainly improves
the cell-edge user performance. Moreover, this paper studies the effect of LLR
quantization to account for the finite-capacity fronthaul. Numerical
simulations of a practical scenario suggest that in that specific case
cooperating three BSs in a cooperative MIMO system achieves about the same
cell-edge detection reliability as a non-cooperative massive MIMO system with
four times the number of antennas per BS.

best visible 7"" above the white light limb, very close to the inner limb,
defined as the inflection point of the rising part of the center-to-limb
intensity variation. They are correlated with, but are not identical to
spicules in emission, seen in the 1600 A band. Similar results were obtained
from AIA and SOT images. Tall spicules in 304 A are not associated with any
absorption in the higher temperature bands. Performing azimuthal averaging of
the intensity over 15 degree sectors near the N, S, E and W limbs, we measured
the height of the limb and of the peak intensity in all AIA bands. We found
that the inner limb height in the transition region AIA bands increases with
wavelength, consistent with a bound-free origin of the absorption from neutral
H and He. From that we computed the column density and the density of neutral
hydrogen as a function of height. We estimated a height of (2300 $\pm$ 500)km

MAVs are assumed to be unaware of the terrain and locations of the landmarks.
They hold a priori information about landmarks, whose interpretation is prone
to errors. Errors are of two types, recognition or advice. Recognition errors
follow from misinterpretation of sensed data or a priori information, or
confusion of objects, e.g., due to faulty sensors. Advice errors are
consequences of outdated or wrong information about landmarks, e.g., due to
weather conditions. Our path planning algorithm is cooperative. MAVs
communicate and exchange information wirelessly, to minimize the number of

effectively address the problems of data sparsity and cold start. Recently, a
variety of methods have been developed for this problem, which generally try to
learn effective representations of users and items and then match items to
users according to their representations. Though these methods have been shown
quite effective, they lack good explanations, which are critical to recommender
systems. In this paper, we take a different route and propose generating
recommendations by finding meaningful paths from users to items. Specifically,
we formulate the problem as a sequential decision process, where the target
user is defined as the initial state, and the edges on the graphs are defined
as actions. We shape the rewards according to existing state-of-the-art methods
and then train a policy function with policy gradient methods. Experimental
results on three real-world datasets show that our proposed method not only
provides effective recommendations but also offers good explanations.

invariant to reorderings of its elements -- implies the existence of a simple
conditional independence structure that may be leveraged in the design of
statistical models and inference procedures. In this work, we study a
relaxation of exchangeability in which this invariance need not hold precisely.
We introduce the notion of local exchangeability -- where swapping data
associated with nearby covariates causes a bounded change in the distribution.
We prove that locally exchangeable processes correspond to independent
observations from an underlying measure-valued stochastic process. Using this
main probabilistic result, we show that the local empirical measure of a finite
collection of observations provides an approximation of the underlying
measure-valued process and Bayesian posterior predictive distributions. The

commercial companies, and academia continues to push research for autonomous
vehicle navigation, particularly in varying environmental conditions and
beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) applications. This article addresses trajectory
generation for UAVs operating in extreme environments where the wind
disturbances may exceed the vehicle's closed-loop stability bounds. To do this,
a controller is developed that has two modes of operation: (1) normal mode, and
(2) drift mode. In the normal mode the vehicle's thrust and sensor limitations
are not exceeded by environmental conditions, whereas in the drift mode they
are. In the drift mode, a drift frame that moves with the prevailing wind is
established in which the vehicle maintains control authority to generate and
track trajectories. The vehicle maintains control authority by relaxing the
inertial frame trajectory tracking requirement and re-planning the trajectory
in the drift frame. Guarantees are established to ensure tracking of the
trajectory, collision avoidance, and respecting the vehicle thrust and sensor
limitations. Simulation results demonstrate the algorithm properties through
two scenarios. First, the performance of two quadrotors is compared where one
utilizes the drift mode and the other does not. Second, multiple vehicles
navigate through two narrow openings between protected and windy environments
to demonstrate on-board updates to navigation parameters based on environmental
conditions.

peak optical intensity constraints. Then, lower and upper bounds on the secrecy

find that a self-similar field emerges if the `specific cavitation energy' is

available classical solutions, while at high expansion velocities shock waves
can appear. Investigation of the constitutive sensitivities of the expansion
field is conducted and compared with available results for the spherical field

It is shown that shock waves appear at significantly lower expansion

compressibility is found to have a negligible effect. This insensitivity can be
taken advantage of in the future for design of light weight protective layers

of the transition has a better cosmological fit than a conventional CPL model

transition in the growth of matter perturbations and structure formation. This
is manifest in the linear matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, the logarithmic growth

The differences in these last three quantities is at a percent-level using the

standard non-adaptive feature extraction techniques with information loss which
can adversely affect robustness. Stochastic neural networks, on the other hand,
are a class of models capable of incorporating rich regularization mechanisms
into the learning process. We consider a deep convolutional neural network that
first decomposes speech into frequency sub-bands via an adaptive parametric
convolutional block where filters are specified by cosine modulations of
compactly supported windows. The network then employs standard non-parametric
1D convolutions to extract relevant spectro-temporal patterns while gradually
compressing the structured high dimensional representation generated by the
parametric block. We rely on a probabilistic parametrization of the proposed
neural architecture and learn the model using stochastic variational inference.
This requires evaluation of an analytically intractable integral defining the
Kullback-Leibler divergence term responsible for regularization, for which we
propose an effective approximation based on the Gauss-Hermite quadrature. Our
empirical results demonstrate a superior performance of the proposed approach
over comparable waveform-based baselines and indicate that it could lead to
robustness. Moreover, the approach outperforms a recently proposed deep
convolutional neural network for learning of robust acoustic models with
standard FBANK features.

TaSe3 mesowires (MWs) using a one-step approach. For the MW of ~300 nm thick, a
distinct CDW transition occurs at 65 K in the resistivity measurement, which
has not been reported before and is further evidenced by the Raman

prepared bulk single crystal TaSe3. Although no anomaly appears in the

with this model is that its latent dimension that has a large impact on the

lower-order model class could be totally nested into a higher-order class, and
the corresponding likelihood is nondecreasing. Hence, criterion built on the
likelihood is not appropriate for model selection. This paper addresses the
issue and proposes a criterion for linear dynamical system based on the
principle of minimum description length. The latent structure, which is omitted
in previous work, is explicitly considered in this newly proposed criterion.
Our work extends the principle of minimum description length and demonstrates
its effectiveness in the tasks of model training. The experiments on both

switching of the dominant mechanism from anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling to
coherent electron-phonon coupling, as manifested by a phase change of $\pi$ in
the electron temperature modulation. Our approach thus opens up possibilities
for coherently manipulating the interactions and properties of quasi-2D and
other quantum materials using light.

constraining the properties of their progenitor systems. Theoretical studies
predicted that the UV spectra, which probe the outermost layers of a SN, should
be sensitive to the metal content of the progenitor. Using the largest SN Ia UV
(lambda<2900 A) spectroscopic sample obtained from Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory, we investigate the dependence of UV spectra on metallicity. For
the first time, our results reveal a correlation (~2 sigma) between SN Ia UV
flux and host-galaxy metallicities, with SNe in more metal-rich galaxies (which
are likely to have higher progenitor metallicities) having lower UV flux level.
We find that this metallicity effect is only significant at short wavelengths
(lambda<2700 A), which agrees well with the theoretical predictions. We produce
UV spectral templates for SNe Ia at peak brightness. With our sample, we could
disentangle the effect of light-curve shape and metallicity on the UV spectra.
We also examine the correlation between the UV spectra and SN luminosities as
parameterised by Hubble residuals. However, we do not see a significant trend
with Hubble residuals. This is probably due to the large uncertainties in SN
distances, as the majority of our sample members are extremely nearby (redshift
z<0.01). Future work with SNe discovered in the Hubble flow will be necessary
to constrain a potential metallicity bias on SN Ia cosmology.

enables us to leverage the Variational Dropout so that the approximation of the

posterior-guided sampling method is then presented to sample architecture
candidates and directly make evaluations. As a Bayesian approach, our
posterior-guided NAS (PGNAS) avoids tuning a number of hyper-parameters and
enables a very effective architecture sampling in posterior probability space.
Interestingly, it also leads to a deeper insight into the weight sharing used
in the one-shot NAS and naturally alleviates the mismatch between the sampled
architecture and weights caused by the weight sharing. We validate our PGNAS
method on the fundamental image classification task. Results on Cifar-10,

neutron star to a quark star) in the wake of a core-collapse Supernova
explosion of a massive star, we develop a unified model for long duration
Gamma-ray Bursts (LGRBs) and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The time delay (years to
decades) between the SN and the QN and, the fragmented nature (i.e. millions of
chunks) of the relativistic QN ejecta are key to yielding a robust LGRB engine.
In our model, a LGRB light-curve exhibits the interaction of the fragmented QN
ejecta with a turbulent (i.e. filamentary and magnetically saturated) SN ejecta
which is shaped by its interaction with an underlying pulsar wind nebula (PWN).
The afterglow is due to the interaction of the QN chunks, exiting the SN
ejecta, with the surrounding medium. Our model can fit BAT/XRT prompt and
afterglow light-curves, simultaneously with their spectra, thus yielding the
observed properties of LGRBs (e.g. the Band function and the X-ray flares). We
find that the Yonetoku law and the Amati law are not fundamental but
phenomenological. FRBs result from coherent synchrotron emission when the QN
chunks interact with non-turbulent weakly magnetized PWN-SN ejecta, where
conditions are prone to the Weibel instability. Magnetic field amplification
induced by the Weibel instability sets the bunching length for electrons and
pairs to radiate coherently. The resulting emission frequency, luminosity,
duration and dispersion measure in our model are consistent with FRB data. We
find a natural unification of high-energy burst phenomena from FRBs to LGRBs
including X-ray Flashes and X-ray rich GRBs as well as Super-Luminous SNe. We
find a possible connection between Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays and FRBs and
propose that a QN following a binary neutron star merger can yield a short GRB

simulated by solving relativistic hydrodynamic equation with source term which
accounts for the energy and momentum deposited by hard jet shower to soft

waveforms from acoustic features by predicting amplitude and phase spectra
hierarchically. Different from existing neural vocoders such as WaveNet,
SampleRNN and WaveRNN which directly generate waveform samples using single
neural networks, the HiNet vocoder is composed of an amplitude spectrum
predictor (ASP) and a phase spectrum predictor (PSP). The ASP is a simple DNN
model which predicts log amplitude spectra (LAS) from acoustic features. The
predicted LAS are sent into the PSP for phase recovery. Considering the issue
of phase warping and the difficulty of phase modeling, the PSP is constructed
by concatenating a neural source-filter (NSF) waveform generator with a phase
extractor. We also introduce generative adversarial networks (GANs) into both
ASP and PSP. Finally, the outputs of ASP and PSP are combined to reconstruct
speech waveforms by short-time Fourier synthesis. Since there are no
autoregressive structures in both predictors, the HiNet vocoder can generate
speech waveforms with high efficiency. Objective and subjective experimental
results show that our proposed HiNet vocoder achieves better naturalness of
reconstructed speech than the conventional STRAIGHT vocoder, a 16-bit WaveNet
vocoder using open source implementation and an NSF vocoder with similar
complexity to the PSP and obtains similar performance with a 16-bit WaveRNN
vocoder. We also find that the performance of HiNet is insensitive to the
complexity of the neural waveform generator in PSP to some extend. After
simplifying its model structure, the time consumed for generating 1s waveforms
of 16kHz speech using a GPU can be further reduced from 0.34s to 0.19s without
significant quality degradation.

the duties, delegating responsibilities and optimizing the flow of information.
Only for the smallest companies the lack of the hierarchy, that is, a flat one,
is possible. Yet, if they grow, the introduction of a hierarchy is inevitable.
Most often, its existence results in different nature of the tasks and duties
of its members located at various organizational levels or in distant parts of
it. On the other hand, employees often send dozens of emails each day, and by
doing so, and also by being engaged in other activities, they naturally form an
informal social network where nodes are individuals and edges are the actions
linking them. At first, such a social network seems distinct from the
organizational one. However, the analysis of this network may lead to
reproducing the organizational hierarchy of companies. This is due to the fact
that that people holding a similar position in the hierarchy possibly share
also a similar way of behaving and communicating attributed to their role. The
key concept of this work is to evaluate how well social network measures when
combined with other features gained from the feature engineering align with the
classification of the members of organizational social network. As a technique
for answering this research question, machine learning apparatus was employed.
Here, for the classification task, Decision Trees, Random Forest, {Neural
Networks and Support Vector Machines} have been evaluated, as well as a
collective classification algorithm, which is also proposed in this paper. The
results demonstrate that the social network built using the metadata on
communication highly exposes the organizational structure.

in the continuum limit within the framework of Ott-Antonsen reduction method,
determining the states with a constant mean field and their stability
boundaries in terms of the characteristics of the rotators' frequency
distribution. The system is established to display three macroscopic regimes,
namely the homogeneous stationary state, the oscillatory state and the
heterogeneous stationary state, whereby the transitions between the
characteristic domains involve a complex bifurcation structure, organized
around three codimension-two bifurcation points: a Bogdanov-Takens point, a
cusp point and a fold-homoclinic point. Apart from the monostable domains, our
study also reveals two domains admitting bistable behavior, manifested as
coexistence between the two stationary solutions, or between a stationary and a
periodic solution. It is shown that the collective mode may emerge via two
generic scenarios, guided by a SNIPER or the Hopf bifurcation, such that the
transition from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous stationary state under
increasing diversity may follow the classical paradigm, but may also be
hysteretic. We demonstrate that the basic bifurcation structure holds
qualitatively in presence of small noise or small coupling delay, with the
boundaries of the characteristic domains shifted compared to the noiseless and

clearly a task of considerable size, one that is beyond the scope of this
paper. Instead a case study-based research approach -- primarily focusing on
the UK -- has been adopted to evaluate the evidence of the teaching of
cybersecurity within general computer science to university-level students.
Thus, in the context of widespread international computer science/engineering
curriculum reform, what does this need to embed cybersecurity knowledge and
skills mean more generally for institutions and educators, and how can we teach
this subject more effectively? Through this UK case study, and by contrasting
with related initiatives in the US, we demonstrate the positive effect that
national accreditation requirements can have, and offer some recommendations
both for future research and curriculum developments.

cosmological studies. Given the redshift $z$, it relates luminosity distance
$D^L$ with angular diameter distance $D^A$ through $(1+z)^2D^A/D^L\equiv1$.
Many efforts have been devoted to test the CDDR with various observational
approaches. However, to the best of our knowledge, those methods are always
affected by cosmic opacity which could make the CDDR violated due to the
non-conservation of photon number. Such mechanism is more related with
astropartical physics. In this work, to directly study the nature of
space-time, i.e., to disentangle it from astropartical physics, we propose a
new strategy to test the CDDR with strong lensing providing $D^A$ and
gravitational wave providing $D^L$. It is known that the propagation of
gravitational wave is unaffected by cosmic opacity. We demonstrate distances
from optical lensing observation are also opacity-free. These two kinds of
distance measurements make it possible to test any metric theories of gravity
where photons travel along null geodesics. Our results show the constraints on
deviations of the CDDR will be very competitive to current techniques.

three-dimensional numerical studies of the population inversion in the Rabi

interference and spatial conflicts with one another. Neglecting the occurrence

technique, which uses a two-level coordination strategy to minimize and
explicitly manage the occurrence of conflicts and interference. The first level
guides the agents to single out exclusive target nodes on a topological map.
This target selection relies on a shared idleness representation and a
coordination mechanism preventing topological conflicts. The second level hosts
coordination strategies based on a metric representation of space and is
supported by a 3D SLAM system. Here, each robot path planner negotiates spatial
conflicts by applying a multi-robot traversability function. Continuous
interactions between these two levels ensure coordination and conflicts
resolution. Both simulations and real-world experiments are presented to
validate the performances of the proposed patrolling strategy in 3D
environments. Results show this is a promising solution for managing spatial
conflicts and preventing deadlocks.

model in quantum optics. It is considered to be the simplest and most
fundamental system describing quantum light-matter interaction. The objective
of the paper is to give an analytical formula of the heat kernel of the
Hamiltonian explicitly by infinite series of iterated integrals. The derivation
of the formula is based on the direct evaluation of the Trotter-Kato product
formula without the use of Feynman-Kac path integrals. More precisely, the
infinite sum in the expression of the heat kernel arises from the reduction of
the Trotter-Kato product formula into sums over the orbits of the action of the
infinite symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_\infty$ on the group
$\mathbb{Z}_2^{\infty}$, and the iterated integrals are then considered as the
orbital integral for each orbit. Here, the groups $ \mathbb{Z}_2^{\infty} $ and
$\mathfrak{S}_\infty$ are the inductive limit of the families
$\{\mathbb{Z}_2^n\}_{n\geq0}$ and $\{\mathfrak{S}_n\}_{n\geq0}$, respectively.
In order to complete the reduction, an extensive study of harmonic (Fourier)
analysis on the inductive family of abelian groups $\mathbb{Z}_2^n\, (n \geq0)$
together with a graph theoretical investigation is crucial. To the best
knowledge of the authors, this is the first explicit computation for obtaining
a closed formula of the heat kernel for a non-trivial realistic interacting
quantum system. The heat kernel of this model is further given by a two-by-two
matrix valued function and is expressed as a direct sum of two respective heat
kernels representing the parity ($\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry) decomposition of the
Hamiltonian by parity.

3$. Improving a result of Stiebitz, Abbott and Zhou proved in 1995 that for all
$k\geq 4$, such graph contains $\Omega(n^{1/(k-1)})$ distinct $(k-1)$-critical
subgraphs. Since then no progress had been made until very recently, Hare
resolved the case $k=4$ by showing that any $4$-critical graph on $n$ vertices
contains at least $(8n-29)/3$ odd cycles.
  In this paper, we mainly focus on 4-critical graphs and develop some novel
tools for counting cycles of specified parity. Our main result shows that any
$4$-critical graph on $n$ vertices contains $\Omega(n^2)$ odd cycles, which is
tight up to a constant factor by infinite many graphs. As a crucial step, we
prove the same bound for 3-connected non-bipartite graphs, which may be of
independent interest. Using the tools, we also give a very short proof for the
case $k=4$. Moreover, we improve the longstanding lower bound of Abbott and
Zhou to $\Omega(n^{1/(k-2)})$ for the general case $k\geq 5$. We will also
discuss some related problems on $k$-critical graphs in the final section.

optimization technique to train the feedforward neural networks, while the
resulting training process is used to build a better stock price prediction
model. Furthermore, the study also presents a comparative performance
evaluation of three different stock price forecasting models; namely, the
particle swarm optimization trained feedforward neural network model, the
genetic algorithm trained feedforward neural network model and the well-known
ARIMA model. The system developed in support of this study utilizes sixteen
stock indices as time series datasets for training and testing purpose. Three
statistical evaluation measures are used to compare the results of the
implemented models, namely the root mean squared error, the mean absolute
percentage error and the mean absolution deviation. The computational results
obtained reveal that the symbiotic organisms search trained feedforward neural
network model exhibits outstanding predictive performance compared to the other
models. However, the performance study shows that the three metaheuristics

for solving problems of high dimensional nonlinear time series data, which are

of the complete graph onto an orientable surface where each face is a cycle of
a fixed length $k$, for infinitely many values of $k$. In particular, under
certain conditions, we show that there exists at least $(n-2)[(p-2)!]^2/(e^2
kn)$ non-isomorphic face $2$-colourable biembeddings of $K_{2nk+1}$ in which
all faces are cycles of length $k=4p+3$. These conditions are: $n\equiv 1\mod
4$, $k\equiv 3\mod 4$ and either $n$ is prime or $n\gg k$ and $n\equiv 0\mod 3$
implies $p\equiv 1\mod 3$. To achieve this result we begin by verifying the
existence of $(n-2)[(p-2)!/e]^2$ non-equivalent Heffter arrays, $H(n;k)$, which
satisfy the conditions: (1) for each row and each column the sequential partial
sums determined by the natural ordering must be distinct modulo $2nk+1$; (2)
the composition of the natural orderings of the rows and columns is equivalent
to a single cycle permutation on the entries in the array. The existence of
Heffter arrays $H(n;k)$ that satisfy condition (1) was established earlier in
\cite{BCDY} and in this current paper we vary this construction and show that
there are at least $(n-2)[(p-2)!/e]^2$ such non-equivalent $H(n;k)$ that
satisfy condition (1) and then show that each of these Heffter arrays also
satisfy condition (2) under certain conditions.

The advanced Gamow IMSRG is capable of describing the resonance and nonresonant
continuum properties of weakly bound and unbound nuclear many-body systems. As
test grounds, carbon and oxygen isotopes have been calculated with chiral two-
and three-nucleon forces from the effective field theory. Resonant states
observed in the neutron-dripline 24O are well reproduced. The halo structure of
the known heaviest Borromean nucleus 22C is clearly seen by calculating the
density distribution in which the continuum s channel plays a crucial role.
Furthermore, we predict low-lying resonant excited states in 22C. The Gamow
IMSRG provides tractable ab initio calculations of weakly bound and unbound
open quantum systems.

  of differential equations",,,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inverse problem is ubiquitous in science and engineering, and Bayesian
methodologies are often used to infer the underlying parameters. For high
dimensional temporal-spatial models, classical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods are often slow to converge, and it is necessary to apply
Metropolis-within-Gibbs (MwG) sampling on parameter blocks. However, the
computation cost of each MwG iteration is typically $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the
model dimension. This can be too expensive in practice. This paper introduces a
new reduced computation method to bring down the computation cost to $O(n)$,
for the inverse initial value problem of a stochastic differential equation
(SDE) with local interactions. The key observation is that each MwG proposal is
only different from the original iterate at one parameter block, and this
difference will only propagate within a local domain in the SDE computations.
Therefore we can approximate the global SDE computation with a surrogate
updated only within the local domain for reduced computation cost. Both
theoretically and numerically, we show that the approximation errors can be
controlled by the local domain size. We discuss how to implement the local
computation scheme using Euler--Maruyama and 4th order Runge--Kutta methods. We
numerically demonstrate the performance of the proposed method with the Lorenz
96 model and a linear stochastic flow model.

treatment of diseases. Medical image reconstruction is one of the most
fundamental and important components of medical imaging, whose major objective
is to acquire high-quality medical images for clinical usage at minimal cost
and risk to the patients. Mathematical models in medical image reconstruction
or, more generally, image restoration in computer vision, have been playing a
prominent role. Earlier mathematical models are mostly designed by human
knowledge or hypothesis on the image to be reconstructed, and we shall call
these models handcrafted models. Later, handcrafted plus data-driven modeling
started to emerge which still mostly relies on human designs, while part of the
model is learned from the observed data. More recently, as more data and
computation resources are made available, deep learning based models (or deep
models) pushed data-driven modeling to the extreme where the models are mostly
based on learning with minimal human designs. Both handcrafted and data-driven
modeling have their own advantages and disadvantages. One of the major research
trends in medical imaging is to combine handcrafted modeling with deep modeling
so that we can enjoy benefits from both approaches. The major part of this
article is to provide a conceptual review of some recent works on deep modeling
from the unrolling dynamics viewpoint. This viewpoint stimulates new designs of
neural network architectures with inspiration from optimization algorithms and
numerical differential equations. Given the popularity of deep modeling, there
are still vast remaining challenges in the field, as well as opportunities
which we shall discuss at the end of this article.

element methods (CSFEMs)$-$are introduced for three-dimensional compressible
and incompressible nonlinear elasticity. A Hu-Washizu-type functional is
extremized in order to obtain a mixed formulation for nonlinear elasticity. The
independent fields of the mixed formulations are the displacement, the
displacement gradient, and the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress. A pressure-like
field is also introduced in the case of incompressible elasticity. We define
the displacement in $H^1$, the displacement gradient in $H(curl)$, the stress
in $H(div)$, and the pressure-like field in $L^2$. In this setting, for
improving the stability of the proposed finite element methods without
compromising their consistency, we consider some stabilizing terms in the
Hu-Washizu-type functional that vanish at its critical points. Using a
conforming interpolation, the solution and the test spaces are approximated
with some piecewise polynomial subspaces of them. In three dimensions, this
requires using the N\'ed\'elec edge elements for the displacement gradient and
the N\'ed\'elec face elements for the stress. This approach results in mixed
finite element methods that satisfy the Hadamard jump condition and the
continuity of traction on all internal faces of the mesh. This, in particular,
makes CSFEMs quite efficient for modeling heterogeneous solids. We assess the
performance of CSFEMs by solving several numerical examples, and demonstrate
their good performance for bending problems, for bodies with complex
geometries, and in the near-incompressible and the incompressible regimes.
Using CSFEMs, one can capture very large strains and accurately approximate
stresses and the pressure field. Moreover, in our numerical examples, we do not
observe any numerical artifacts such as checkerboarding of pressure, hourglass
instability, or locking.

important area of study in recent years due to its potential application in
reduction of pesticides usage. Minute amounts of long chain polymers added to
water has been known to arrest the droplet rebound effect on superhydrophobic
surfaces. Previous studies have attributed different reasons like extensional
viscosity, dominance of elastic stresses or slowing down of contact line in
retraction phase due to stretching of polymer chains. The present study
attempts to unravel the existence of critical criteria of polymer concentration
and impact velocity on the inhibition of droplet rebound. The impact velocity
will indirectly influence the shear rate during the retraction phase, and the
polymer concentration dictates the relaxation timescale of the elastic fluids.
Finally we show that the Weissenberg number (at onset of retraction), which
quantifies both the elastic effects of polymer chains and the hydrodynamics, is
the critical parameter in determining the regime of onset of rebound
suppression, and that there exists a critical value which determines the onset
of bounce arrest. The previous three causes, which are manifestations of
elastic effects in non-Newtonian fluids, can be related with the proposed
Weissenberg number criterion.
