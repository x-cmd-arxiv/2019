novel landmark retrieval/recognition system, robust to a noisy and diverse

neural networks with metric learning, trained by cosine-softmax based losses.
Deep metric learning methods are usually sensitive to noise, and it could
hinder to learn a reliable metric. To address this issue, we develop an
automated data cleaning system. Besides, we devise a discriminative re-ranking
method to address the diversity of the dataset for landmark retrieval. Using
our methods, we achieved 1st place in the Google Landmark Retrieval 2019

to be an effective technique to reduce the power consumption and hardware
complexity of wireless transceivers. However, in systems with low-resolution
ADCs, obtaining channel state information (CSI) is difficult due to significant
distortions in the received signals. The primary motivation of this paper is to
show that learning techniques can mitigate the impact of CSI unavailability. We
study the blind detection problem in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with low-resolution ADCs using learning approaches. Two methods, which
employ a sequence of pilot symbol vectors as the initial training data, are
proposed. The first method exploits the use of a cyclic redundancy check (CRC)
to obtain more training data, which helps improve the detection accuracy. The
second method is based on the perspective that the to-be-decoded data can
itself assist the learning process, so no further training information is
required except the pilot sequence. For the case of 1-bit ADCs, we provide a
performance analysis of the vector error rate for the proposed methods. Based
on the analytical results, a criterion for designing transmitted signals is
also presented. Simulation results show that the proposed methods outperform
existing techniques and are also more robust.

peristaltic-like locomotion in a segmented origami robot. Specifically, we
demonstrate the use of multi-stability embedded in origami skeleton to
eliminate the need for multiple actuators or digital controllers to coordinate
the complex robotic movements in peristaltic crawling. The crawling robot in
this study consists of two serially connected bistable origami segments, each
featuring a generalized Kresling design and a foldable anchoring mechanism.
Mechanics analysis and experimental testing of this dual-segment module reveal
a deterministic deformation sequence or actuation cycle, which is then used to
generate the different phases in a peristaltic-like locomotion gait. Instead of
individually controlling the segment deformation like in earthworm and other
crawling robots, we only control the total length of this robot. Therefore,
this approach can significantly reduce the total number of actuators needed for
locomotion and simplify the control requirements. Moreover, the richness in
Kresling origami design offers us substantial freedom to tailor the locomotion
performance. Results of this study will contribute to a paradigm shift in how
we can use the mechanics of multi-stability for robotic actuation and control.

  Communication","30 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, the problem of maximizing the wireless users' sum-rate for
uplink rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) communications is studied. In the
considered model, each user transmits a superposition of two messages to a base
station (BS) with separate transmit power and the BS uses a successive decoding
technique to decode the received messages. To maximize each user's transmission
rate, the users must adjust their transmit power and the BS must determine the
decoding order of the messages transmitted from the users to the BS. This
problem is formulated as a sum-rate maximization problem with proportional rate
constraints by adjusting the users' transmit power and the BS's decoding order.
However, since the decoding order variable in the optimization problem is
discrete, the original maximization problem with transmit power and decoding
order variables can be transformed into a problem with only the rate splitting
variable. Then, the optimal rate splitting of each user is determined. Given
the optimal rate splitting of each user and a decoding order, the optimal
transmit power of each user is calculated. Next, the optimal decoding order is
determined by an exhaustive search method. To further reduce the complexity of
the optimization algorithm used for sum-rate maximization in RSMA, a user
pairing based algorithm is introduced, which enables two users to use RSMA in
each pair and also enables the users in different pairs to be allocated with
orthogonal frequency. For comparisons, the optimal sum-rate maximizing
solutions with proportional rate constraints are obtained in closed form for
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), frequency division multiple access
(FDMA), and time division multiple access (TDMA). Simulation results show that
RSMA can achieve up to 10.0\%, 22.2\%, and 83.7\% gains in terms of sum-rate
compared to NOMA, FDMA, and TDMA.

various methods of implementing the hadron-to-quark phase transition,

soft (Gibbs construction) interfaces, and smooth crossover transitions. We find
that within the models we apply, hadronic matter has to be stiff for a
first-order phase transition and soft for a crossover transition. In both
scenarios and for the equations of state we employed, quarks appear at the
center of pre-merger neutron stars in the mass range $\approx 1.0-1.6\,{\rm

recently discovered neutron star masses $\geq 2\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$. We also

with quark cores from normal hadronic stars is very difficult from the
knowledge of masses and radii alone, unless drastic sharp transitions induce
distinctive disconnected hybrid branches in the mass-radius relation.

temperature for self-interacting massive scalar quantum field theories on
Minkowski spacetime proposed by Fredenhagen and Lindner with results obtained
in ordinary thermal field theory, by means of real time and Matsubara
formalisms. In the construction of this state, even if the adiabatic limit is
considered, the interaction Lagrangian is multiplied by a smooth time cut-off.
In this way the interaction starts adiabatically and the correlation functions
are free from divergences. The corresponding interaction Hamiltonian is a local
interacting field smeared over the interval of time where the chosen cut-off is
not constant. In order to cope with this smearing, the Matsubara propagator
needs to be modified. We obtain an expansion of the correlation functions of
the interacting equilibrium state as a sum over certain type of graphs with
mixed edges, some of them correspond to modified Matsubara propagators and
others to propagators of the real time formalism. An integration over the
adiabatic time cut-off is present in every vertex. However, at every order in
perturbation theory, the final result does not depend on the particular form of
the cut-off function. The obtained graphical expansion contains in it both the
real time formalism and the Matsubara formalism as particular cases. Finally,
we show that a particular factorisation which is used to derive the ordinary
real time formalism holds only in special cases and we present a
counterexample. We conclude with the analysis of certain correlation functions
and we notice that corrections to the self-energy in a $\lambda\phi^4$ at
finite temperature theory are expected.

Additionally, we generate a mock data of SLS to asses the impact of the chosen
mass profile on the accuracy of Einstein radius estimation. Our results show
that cosmological constraints are very sensitive to the selected data: some
cases show convergence problems in the estimation of cosmological parameters
(e.g. systems with observed distance ratio $D^{obs}<0.5$), others show high
values for the chi-square function (e.g. systems with a lens equation $D^{obs}
>1$ or high velocity dispersion $\sigma > 276$ km s$^{-1}$). However, we
obtained a fiduciary sample with 143 systems which improves the constraints on
each tested cosmological model.

input reconstruction, to measure input information contained by a specific
layer from two perspectives. Unlike previous attribution metrics, the proposed
metrics ensure the fairness of comparisons between different layers of
different DNNs. We can use these metrics to analyze the efficiency of
information processing in DNNs, which exhibits strong connections to the
performance of DNNs. We analyze information discarding in a pixel-wise manner,
which is different from the information bottleneck theory measuring feature
information w.r.t. the sample distribution. Experiments have shown the
effectiveness of our metrics in analyzing classic DNNs and explaining existing

exploits selected optimal features from an estimated latent space of data

However, point clouds are intrinsically irregular and the points are sparsely

pooling layers in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are capable of reducing
the dimensionality of the problem and extracting high-level information
simultaneously, grids and highly regular data format are required as input. In
order to balance model performance and complexity, we introduce a novel neural
network architecture exploiting local features from a manually subsampled point
set. In our network, a recursive farthest point sampling method is firstly
applied to efficiently cover the entire point set. Successively, we employ the
k-nearest neighbours (knn) algorithm to gather local neighbourhood for each
group of the subsampled points. Finally, a multiple layer perceptron (MLP) is
applied on the subsampled points and edges that connect corresponding point and
neighbours to extract local features. The architecture has been tested for both
shape classification and segmentation using the ModelNet40 and ShapeNet part
datasets, in order to show that the network achieves the best trade-off in
terms of competitive performance when compared to other state-of-the-art

benefit of flexible demand resources is evaluated by the operation performance
enhancement of microgrid and correspondingly the resource is priced based on a
benefit sharing approach. An iteration-based chance-constrained method is
established to calculate the economic benefit and shared compensation for

These stars were far larger than, and much dimmer than, the sun -- his De
Stella Nova shows that every visible star must exceed the size of the Earth's
orbit, and the most prominent stars may exceed the size of the entire planetary
system. His other writings, including his response to Ingoli, his Dissertatio

Copernican universe. To Kepler, such a universe was an illustration of divine
power -- and solid evidence against the stars being suns, against the universe
of Giordano Bruno. Kepler's starry universe was in fact the Copernican universe
supported by observations of the stars, which showed them to have measureable
apparent sizes. Not until the later seventeenth century were those apparent
sizes shown to be spurious, allowing for a universe in which the stars were
suns.

framework to naturally incorporate three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) for
generating the observed light neutrino masses and mixing by the type-I seesaw
mechanism. We examine the collider testability of the $U(1)_X$ model, both in
its minimal form with the conventional charges, as well as with an alternative
charge assignment, via the resonant production of the $U(1)_X$ gauge boson
($Z^\prime$) and its subsequent decay into a pair of RHNs. We first derive an
updated upper limit on the new gauge coupling $g_X$ as a function of the
$Z'$-boson mass from the latest LHC dilepton searches. Then we identify the
maximum possible cross section for the RHN pair-production under these
constraints. Finally, we investigate the possibility of having one of the RHNs
long-lived, even for a TeV-scale mass. Employing the general parametrization
for the light neutrino mass matrix to reproduce the observed neutrino
oscillation data, we perform a parameter scan and find a simple formula for the
maximum RHN lifetime as a function of the lightest neutrino mass eigenvalue
($m_{\rm lightest}$). We find that for $m_{\rm lightest}\lesssim 10^{-5}$ eV,
one of the RHNs in the minimal $U(1)_X$ scenario can be long-lived with a
displaced-vertex signature which can be searched for at the LHC and/or with a
dedicated long-lived particle detector, such as MATHUSLA. In other words, once
a long-lived RHN is observed, we can set an upper bound on the lightest
neutrino mass in this model.

goal is to select $k\ll n$ of them to perform expensive measurements, e.g., to
obtain labels/responses, for a linear regression task. Many statistical
criteria have been proposed for choosing the optimal design, with popular
choices including A- and D-optimality. If prior knowledge is given, typically
in the form of a $d\times d$ precision matrix $\mathbf A$, then all of the
criteria can be extended to incorporate that information via a Bayesian
framework. In this paper, we demonstrate a new fundamental connection between
Bayesian experimental design and determinantal point processes, the latter
being widely used for sampling diverse subsets of data. We use this connection
to develop new efficient algorithms for finding $(1+\epsilon)$-approximations
of optimal designs under four optimality criteria: A, C, D and V. Our
algorithms can achieve this when the desired subset size $k$ is
$\Omega(\frac{d_{\mathbf A}}{\epsilon} + \frac{\log 1/\epsilon}{\epsilon^2})$,
where $d_{\mathbf A}\leq d$ is the $\mathbf A$-effective dimension, which can
often be much smaller than $d$. Our results offer direct improvements over a
number of prior works, for both Bayesian and classical experimental design, in
terms of algorithm efficiency, approximation quality, and range of applicable

geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) on electrical power systems.
Geomagnetically-induced currents (GICs) can saturate transformers, induce
hot-spot heating and increase reactive power losses. Unpredictable GMDs caused
by solar storms can significantly increase the risk of transformer failure. In
this paper, we develop a two-stage, distributionally robust (DR) optimization
formulation that models uncertain GMDs and mitigates the effects of GICs on
power systems through existing system controls (e.g., line switching, generator
re-dispatch, and load shedding). This model assumes an ambiguity set of
probability distributions for induced geo-electric fields which capture
uncertain magnitudes and orientations of a GMD event. We employ
state-of-the-art linear relaxation methods and reformulate the problem as a
two-stage DR model. We use this formulation to develop a decomposition
framework for solving the problem. We demonstrate the approach on the modified
Epri21 system and show that the DR optimization method effectively handles
prediction errors of GMD events.

alike. Fiber-based ultrafast laser sources are especially attractive because of
their compactness, alignment-free setups, and potentially low costs. However,
confining short pulses within a fiber core leads to high intensities, which
drive a host of nonlinear effects. While these phenomena and their interactions
greatly complicate the design of such systems, they can also provide
opportunities for engineering new capabilities. Here, we report a new fiber
amplification regime distinguished by the use of a dynamically-evolving gain
spectrum as a degree of freedom: as a pulse experiences nonlinear spectral
broadening, absorption and amplification actively reshape both the pulse and
the gain spectrum itself. The dynamic co-evolution of the field and
excited-state populations supports pulses that can broaden spectrally by almost
two orders of magnitude and well beyond the gain bandwidth, while remaining
cleanly-compressible to their sub-50-fs transform limit. Theory and experiments
provide evidence that a nonlinear attractor underlies the management of the
nonlinearity by the gain. Further research into the mutual, pulse-inversion
propagation dynamics may address open scientific questions and pave the way
toward simple, compact fiber sources that produce high-energy, sub-30-fs
pulses.

of TMG can also be obtained from entanglement using the Wald-Tachikawa
covariant phase space formalism. Finally, we identify a quasi-local
gravitational energy in the entanglement wedge as the holographic dual of
relative entropy in gravitationally anomalous CFTs. The positivity and
monotonicity of relative entropy imply that such a gravitational energy should
be positive definite and become larger when increasing the size of the

to some subset of arguments being considered more relevant than others.
However, in large discussions readers are often forced to sample a subset of
the arguments being put forth. Since such sampling is rarely done in a
principled manner, users may not read all the relevant arguments to get a full
picture of the debate. This paper is interested in answering the question of
how users should sample online conversations to selectively favour the
currently justified or accepted positions in the debate. We apply techniques
from argumentation theory and complex networks to build a model that predicts
the probabilities of the normatively justified arguments given their location
in online discussions. Our model shows that the proportion of replies that are
supportive, the number of replies that comments receive, and the locations of
un-replied comments all determine the probability that a comment is a justified
argument. We show that when the degree distribution of the number of replies is
homogeneous along the discussion, for acrimonious discussions, the distribution
of justified arguments depends on the parity of the graph level. In supportive
discussions the probability of having justified comments increases as one moves
away from the root. For discussion trees that have a non-homogeneous in-degree
distribution, for supportive discussions we observe the same behaviour as
before, while for acrimonious discussions we cannot observe the same
parity-based distribution. This is verified with data obtained from the online
debating platform Kialo. By predicting the locations of the justified arguments
in reply trees, we can suggest which arguments readers should sample to grasp

proposal is based on the theoretical analysis of the possible symmetries of a
square lattice model with pairwise nearest-neighbor coupling terms. Among the
eight possible symmetry operators we identify the two relevant choices for
topological phases with either time-reversal, chiral, or particle-hole
symmetry. From the corresponding symmetry conditions on the protocol
parameters, we obtain the universal driving protocol where each of the
symmetries can be realized or broken individually. We provide specific
parameter values for the different cases, and demonstrate the existence of
symmetry-protected copropagating and counterpropagating topological boundary
states. The driving protocol especially allows us to switch between bosonic and
fermionic time-reversal symmetry, and thus between a trivial and non-trivial
symmetry-protected topological phase, through continuous variation of a
parameter.

by modifying a double-capacitor model proposed in [1]. It is known that the
original model can address the rate capacity effect and energy recovery effect
inherent to batteries better than other models. However, it is a purely linear
model and includes no representation of a battery's nonlinear phenomena. Hence,
this work transforms the original model by introducing a
nonlinear-mapping-based voltage source and a serial RC circuit. The
modification is justified by an analogy with the single-particle model. Two
parameter estimation approaches, termed 1.0 and 2.0, are designed for the new
model to deal with the scenarios of constant-current and variable-current
charging/discharging, respectively. In particular, the 2.0 approach proposes
the notion of Wiener system identification based on maximum a posteriori
estimation, which allows all the parameters to be estimated in one shot while
overcoming the nonconvexity or local minima issue to obtain physically
reasonable estimates. An extensive experimental evaluation shows that the
proposed model offers excellent accuracy and predictive capability. A
comparison against the Rint and Thevenin models further points to its
superiority. With high fidelity and low mathematical complexity, this model is
beneficial for various real-time battery management applications.

  This paper takes a step towards inference and uncertainty quantification for

Our inferential procedures do not rely on sample splitting, thus avoiding

characterization of the estimation accuracy of our de-biased estimators, which,
to the best of our knowledge, are the first tractable algorithms that provably
achieve full statistical efficiency (including the preconstant). The analysis

towards a strong dichotomy in their star-forming properties relative to systems
with similar mass in the field. Specifically, satellite galaxies are
preferentially gas poor and no longer forming stars, while their field
counterparts are largely gas rich and actively forming stars. Much of the
recent work to understand this dichotomy has been statistical in nature,
determining not just that environmental processes are most likely responsible
for quenching these low-mass systems but also that they must operate very
quickly after infall onto the host system, with quenching timescales $\lesssim
2~ {\rm Gyr}$ at ${M}_{\star} \lesssim 10^{8}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$. This work
utilizes the newly-available $Gaia$ DR2 proper motion measurements along with
the Phat ELVIS suite of high-resolution, cosmological, zoom-in simulations to
study low-mass satellite quenching around the Milky Way on an object-by-object
basis. We derive constraints on the infall times for $37$ of the known low-mass
satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, finding that $\gtrsim~70\%$ of the
`classical' satellites of the Milky Way are consistent with the very short
quenching timescales inferred from the total population in previous works. The
remaining classical Milky Way satellites have quenching timescales noticeably
longer, with $\tau_{\rm quench} \sim 6 - 8~{\rm Gyr}$, highlighting how
detailed orbital modeling is likely necessary to understand the specifics of
environmental quenching for individual satellite galaxies. Additionally, we
find that the $6$ ultra-faint dwarf galaxies with publicly available
$HST$-based star-formation histories are all consistent with having their star
formation shut down prior to infall onto the Milky Way -- which, combined with
their very early quenching times, strongly favors quenching driven by
reionization.

characterise the initial properties of clumps that form through hydrodynamic
instabilities, mostly via the non-linear thin shell instability (NTSI). Our
results confirm that more massive clumps are formed in systems whose winds are
close to the transition between the radiative and adiabatic regimes. Increasing
either the wind speed or the degree of asymmetry increases the dispersion of
the clump mass and ejection speed distributions. Nevertheless, the most massive
clumps are very light (${\sim}10^{-3}$-$10^{-2}\rm\ M_{\oplus}$), about three
orders of magnitude less massive than theoretical upper limits. Applying these
results to the Galactic Centre we find that clumps formed through the NTSI
should not be heavy enough either to affect the thermodynamic state of the
region or to survive for long enough to fall onto the central super-massive
black hole.

self-gravity and hydrodynamics robustly. The main mass of the galaxy resides in
rotationally supported clumps which grow by merging to a maximum clump mass of
10^8 Msol with diameter ~120 pc for the dense gas. They group to clump clusters
(CCs) within relatively short times (<< 50 Myr), which are present over the
whole simulation time. We identify several mass and size scales on which the
clusters appear as single objects at the corresponding observational resolution
between ~10^8 - 10^9 Msol. Most of the clusters emerge as dense groups and for
larger beams they are more likely to be open structures represented by a single

initial structures can collapse further and fragment to many clumps smaller

form on larger scales 0.3-1 kpc with 10^8-10^9 Msol. Here, the artificial
pressure floor which is typically used to prevent spurious fragmentation

supernovae (SNe) emit down-scattered X-rays and gamma-rays originating from
radioactive line emissions, primarily from the $^{56}$Ni $\rightarrow$
$^{56}$Co $\rightarrow$ $^{56}$Fe chain. We use SN models based on
three-dimensional neutrino-driven explosion simulations of single stars and
mergers to compute this emission and compare the predictions with observations
of SN 1987A. A number of models are clearly excluded, showing that high-energy
emission is a powerful way of discriminating between models. The best models
are almost consistent with the observations, but differences that cannot be
matched by a suitable choice of viewing angle are evident. Therefore, our
self-consistent models suggest that neutrino-driven explosions are able to
produce, in principle, sufficient mixing, although remaining discrepancies may
require small changes to the progenitor structures. The soft X-ray cutoff is
primarily determined by the metallicity of the progenitor envelope. The main
effect of asymmetries is to vary the flux level by a factor of ${\sim}$3. For
the more asymmetric models, the shapes of the light curves also change. In
addition to the models of SN 1987A, we investigate two models of Type II-P SNe
and one model of a stripped-envelope Type IIb SN. The Type II-P models have
similar observables as the models of SN 1987A, but the stripped-envelope SN
model is significantly more luminous and evolves faster. Finally, we make
simple predictions for future observations of nearby SNe.

tiny increase in stretching force induces a significant displacement, in close

binary coalescence to model the common envelope density distribution at the
time of coalescence. We find toroidal profiles of material, concentrated in the
binary's equatorial plane and extending to many times the massive star's

circumstellar material (CSM) to estimate the emergent light curves that result
from the interaction between the blast wave and the CSM. We find that typical
merger-driven explosions are brightened by up to three magnitudes by CSM
interaction. From population synthesis models we discover that the brightest
merger-driven explosions, $M_V \sim -18$ to $-19$, are those involving black
holes because they have the most massive and extended CSM. Black hole
coalescence events are also common; they represent about 50% of all

for the formation of supermassive black holes early in the Universe. In an
idealized version of such a scenario, a uniformly rotating supermassive star
spinning at the mass-shedding (Keplerian) limit collapses gravitationally after
it reaches a critical configuration. Under the assumption that the gas is
dominated by radiation pressure, this critical configuration is characterized
by unique values of the dimensionless parameters $J/M^2$ and $R_p/M$, where $J$
is the angular momentum, $R_p$ the polar radius, and $M$ the mass. Motivated by
a previous perturbative treatment we adopt a fully nonlinear approach to
evaluate the effects of gas pressure on these dimensionless parameters for a
large range of masses. We find that gas pressure has a significant effect on
the critical configuration even for stellar masses as large as $M \simeq 10^6

perturbation in a comparison with the exact treatment, and find that one
commonly used approximation in particular results in increasing deviations from
the exact treatment as the mass decreases, and the effects of gas pressure
increase. The other approximation, however, proves to be quite robust for all

causes the appearance of the disc to change continuously, and creates the kind
of shearing spiral patterns that have been widely reported. Although we have
found that individual modes last for relatively few rotations, spiral activity
persists because fresh instabilities appear, which we suspected were excited by
the changes to the disc caused by previous disturbances. Here we confirm our
suspicion by demonstrating that scattering at either of the Lindblad resonances
seeds a new groove-type instability. With this logical gap closed, our
understanding of the behaviour in the simulations is almost complete. We

have attracted attention due to their excellent performance as lithium-ion
battery electrodes. The complex crystallographic structure of these materials
poses a challenge for first-principles computational modelling and hinders the
understanding of their structural, electronic and dynamic properties. In this
article, we study three different niobium-tungsten oxide crystallographic shear
phases (Nb$_{12}$WO$_{33}$, Nb$_{14}$W$_{3}$O$_{44}$, Nb$_{16}$W$_5$O$_{55}$)
using an enumeration-based approach and first-principles density-functional
theory calculations. We report common principles governing the cation disorder,
lithium insertion mechanism, and electronic structure of these materials.
Tungsten preferentially occupies tetrahedral and block-central sites within the
block-type crystal structures. The lithium insertion proceeds via a three-step
mechanism, associated with an anisotropic evolution of the host lattice. Our
calculations reveal an important connection between long-range and local
structural changes: in the second step of the mechanism, the removal of local
structural distortions leads to the contraction of the lattice along specific
crystallographic directions, buffering the volume expansion of the material.
Niobium-tungsten oxide shear structures host small amounts of localised
electrons during initial lithium insertion due to the confining effect of the
blocks, but quickly become metallic upon further lithiation. We argue that the
combination of local, long-range, and electronic structural evolution over the
course of lithiation is beneficial to the performance of these materials as
battery electrodes. The mechanistic principles we establish arise from the
compound-independent crystallographic shear structure, and are therefore likely
to apply to Ti/Nb oxide or pure Nb oxide shear phases.

distances has gained significant attention in recent years, exemplified in
particular by the launch of the Micius satellite in 2016. The performance of
applied protocols such as quantum key distribution (QKD) depends significantly
upon the transmission efficiency through the turbulent atmosphere, which is
especially challenging for ground-to-satellite uplink scenarios. Adaptive
optics (AO) techniques have been used in astronomical, communication, and other
applications to reduce the detrimental effects of turbulence for many years,
but their applicability to quantum protocols, and their requirements
specifically in the uplink scenario, are not well established. Here, we model
the effect of the atmosphere on link efficiency between an Earth station and a
satellite using an optical uplink, and how AO can help recover from loss due to
turbulence. Examining both low-Earth-orbit and geostationary uplink scenarios,
we find that a modest link transmissivity improvement of about 3dB can be
obtained in the case of a co-aligned downward beacon, while the link can be
dramatically improved, up to 7dB, using an offset beacon, such as a laser guide
star. AO coupled with a laser guide star would thus deliver a significant
increase in the secret key generation rate of the QKD ground-to-space uplink
system, especially as reductions of channel loss have favourably nonlinear
key-rate response within this high-loss regime.

Here, we investigate the electronic ground states of $\alpha$-Sr$_2$CrO$_4$, a
compound that is a rare embodiment of the spin-1 Kugel-Khomskii model on the

the experimentally observed peak at $\mathbf{Q}_s$. On the basis of these

clear abundance differences for elements with Z$\leq30$ between both components

condensation temperature (T$_{c}$), which suggests a spectral chemical
signature related to planet formation. In this work we show that our previous
findings are still consistent even if we include more species, like the
volatile N and neutron capture elements (Z $>$ 30). We report a slope with
T$_{c}$ of $1.56 \pm 0.24 \times 10^{-5}$ dex K$^{-1}$, that is good agreement
with both our previous work and recent results by Nissen and collaborators. We
also performed some tests using ARES and iSpec to automatic measure the
equivalent width and found T$_c$ slopes in reasonable agreement with our
results as well. In addition, we determine abundances for Li and Be by spectral
synthesis, finding that 16 Cyg A is richer not only in Li but also in Be, when
compared to its companion. This may be evidence of planet engulfment,
indicating that the T$_{c}$ trend found in this binary system may be a chemical
signature of planet accretion in the A component, rather than a imprint of the
giant planet rocky core formation on 16 Cyg B.

1, the extinction transition of the contact process splits into a set of
nonequilibrium transitions between four regimes when increasing the baseline
death rate $p$ as a control parameter: (i) defection only, (ii) coexistence,
(iii) cooperation only, (iv) extinction. We investigate the transitions between
these regimes. As the main result, we find that full cooperation is established
at the extinction transition as long as benefit is strictly larger than cost.
Qualitatively identical phase diagrams are obtained for populations on square
lattices and in pair approximation. Spatial correlations with nearest neighbors
only are thus sufficient for sustained cooperation.

the cosmologically recent past. Using these observationally motivated orbits,
we calculate the effect of the Antlia 2 dwarf galaxy on the outer HI disk of
the Milky Way, using both test particle and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
simulations. We find that orbits with low pericenters, $\sim$ 10 kpc, produce
disturbances that match the observed outer HI disk perturbations. We have
independently recalculated the proper motion of the Antlia 2 dwarf from Gaia
data and found a proper motion of $(\mu_{\alpha}cos\delta, \mu_{\delta}) =
(-0.068,0.032) \pm (0.023,-0.031)~\rm mas/yr$, which agrees with results from
Torrealba et al. (2019) within the errors, but gives lower mean pericenters,
e.g., $\sim$ 15 kpc for our fiducial model of the Milky Way. We also show that
the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy interaction does not match the observed
perturbations in the outer gas disk. Thus, Antlia 2 may be the driver of the
observed large perturbations in the outer gas disk of the Galaxy. The current
location of the Antlia 2 dwarf galaxy closely matches that predicted by an
earlier dynamical analysis (Chakrabarti \& Blitz 2009) of the dwarf that drove
ripples in the outer Galaxy, and, in particular, its orbit is nearly coplanar
to the Galactic disk. If the Antlia 2 dwarf galaxy is responsible for the
perturbations in the outer Galactic disk, it would have a specific range of
proper motions that we predict here; this can be tested soon with Gaia DR-3 and
Gaia DR-4 data.

surveys to improve constraints on modified gravity using the technique of
Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) tomography. SZ tomography uses the correlations between
the kinetic/polarized SZ contributions to the small-angular scale CMB and the
distribution of structure measured in a galaxy redshift survey to reconstruct
the remote dipole and quadrupole fields, e.g. the CMB dipole and quadrupole
observed throughout the Universe. We compute the effect of a class of
modifications of gravity on the remote dipole and quadrupole fields,
illustrating that these observables combine a number of the desirable features
of existing probes. We then perform a fisher forecast of constraints on a
two-parameter class of modifications of gravity for next-generation CMB
experiments and galaxy surveys. By incorporating information from the
reconstructed remote dipole and quadrupole fields, we find that it is possible
to improve the constraints on this model by a factor of $\sim 2$ beyond what is
possible with a galaxy survey alone. We conclude that SZ tomography is a
promising method for testing gravity with future cosmological datasets.

problems for the sphere. The narrow capture problem models the equilibrium
behavior of a Brownian particle in the exterior of a sphere whose surface is
reflective, except for a collection of small absorbing patches. The narrow
escape problem is the dual problem: it models the behavior of a Brownian
particle confined to the interior of a sphere whose surface is reflective,
except for a collection of small patches through which it can escape.
  Mathematically, these give rise to mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary value
problems of the Poisson equation. They are numerically challenging for two main
reasons: (1) the solutions are non-smooth at Dirichlet-Neumann interfaces, and
(2) they involve adaptive mesh refinement and the solution of large,
ill-conditioned linear systems when the number of small patches is large.
  By using the Neumann Green's functions for the sphere, we recast each
boundary value problem as a system of first-kind integral equations on the
collection of patches. A block-diagonal preconditioner together with a multiple
scattering formalism leads to a well-conditioned system of second-kind integral
equations and a very efficient approach to discretization. This system is
solved iteratively using GMRES. We develop a hierarchical, fast multipole
method-like algorithm to accelerate each matrix-vector product. Our method is
insensitive to the patch size, and the total cost scales with the number N of
patches as O(N log N), after a precomputation whose cost depends only on the
patch size and not on the number or arrangement of patches. We demonstrate the
method with several numerical examples, and are able to achieve highly accurate
solutions with 100,000 patches in one hour on a 60-core workstation.

success of logarithmic negativity in characterizing bosonic many-body systems,
generalizing the operation of PT to fermionic systems remained a technical
challenge until recently when a more natural definition of PT for fermions that
accounts for the Fermi statistics has been put forward. In this paper, we study
the many-body spectrum of the reduced density matrix of two adjacent intervals

in general there is a freedom in the definition of such operation which leads
to two different definitions of PT: the resulting density matrix is Hermitian

on the fluid and eventually forms a membrane that is fixed in the flow due to
adhesion with a substrate. A key challenge is that the location of the immobile
membrane is unknown $\textit{a priori}$. To model this situation, we use a
multiphase framework with fluid and membrane phases; the aqueous chemicals
exist as scalar fields that react within the fluid to induce phase change. To
verify that the model exhibits desired fluid-structure behaviors, we make a few
simplifying assumptions to obtain a reduced form of the equations that is
amenable to exact solution. This analysis demonstrates no-slip behavior on the
developing membrane without $\textit{a priori}$ assumptions on its location.
The model has applications towards precipitate reactions where the precipitate
greatly affects the surrounding flow, a situation appearing in many laboratory

  Social Trust Model",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The emergence of connected vehicles paradigm has made secure communication a
key concern amongst the connected vehicles. Communication between the vehicles
and Road Side Units (RSUs) is critical to disseminate message among the
vehicles. We focus on secure message transmission in connected vehicles using
multi_hop social networks environment to deliver the message with varying
trustworthiness. We proposed a Geographic Social Trust Routing (GSTR) approach;
messages are propagated using multiple hops and by considering the various
available users in the vehicular network. GSTR is proposed in an application
perspective with an assumption that the users are socially connected. The users
are selected based on trustworthiness as defined by social connectivity. The
route to send a message is calculated based on the highest trust level of each
node by using the nodes social network connections along the path in the
network. GSTR determines the shortest route using the trusted nodes along the
route for message dissemination. GSTR is made delay tolerant by introducing
message storage in the cloud if a trustworthy node is unavailable to deliver
the message. We compared the proposed approach with Geographic and Traffic Load
based Routing (GTLR), Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR), Trust-based
GPSR (T_GPSR). The performance results obtained show that GSTR ensures
efficient resource utilization, lower packet losses at high vehicle densities.

presented by Pereira and Stern [Entropy 1(4) (1999) 99-110] as a Bayesian
alternative instead of the traditional significance test using p-value. The
FBST is based on the evidence in favor of the null hypothesis (H). An important
practical issue for the implementation of the FBST is the determination of how
large the evidence must be in order to decide for its rejection. In the
Classical significance tests, it is known that p-value decreases as sample size
increases, so by setting a single significance level, it usually leads H
rejection. In the FBST procedure, the evidence in favor of H exhibits the same
behavior as the p-value when the sample size increases. This suggests that the
cut-off point to define the rejection of H in the FBST should be a sample size
function. In this work, the scenario of Linear Regression Models with known
variance under the Bayesian approach is considered, and a method to find a
cut-off value for the evidence in the FBST is presented by minimizing the
linear combination of the averaged type I and type II error probabilities for a
given sample size and also for a given dimension of the parametric space.

properties by macromolecular engineering. In this context, one of the drawbacks
that often limits broader applications under high temperature conditions is
their poor thermal conductivity $\kappa$. Using molecular dynamics simulations,
we establish a structure-property relationship in hydrogen bonded polymer
blends for possible improvement of $\kappa$. For this purpose, we investigate
two experimentally relevant hydrogen bonded systems -- one system consists of
short poly({N}-acryloyl piperidine) (PAP) blended with longer chains of
poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and the second system is a mixture of PAA and short
poly(acrylamide) (PAM) chains. Simulation results show that PAA-PAP blends are
at the onset of phase separation over the full range of PAP monomer mole
fraction $\phi_{PAP}$, which intensifies even more for $\phi_{PAP} > 0.3$.
While PAA and PAP interact with preferential hydrogen bonding, phase separation
is triggered by the dominant van der Waals attraction between the hydrophobic
side groups of PAP. However, if PAP is replaced with PAM, which has a similar
chemical structure as PAP without the hydrophobic side group, PAA-PAM blends
show much improved solubility. Better solubility is due to the preferential
hydrogen bonding between PAA and PAM. As a result, PAM oligomers act as
cross-linking bridges between PAA chains resulting in a three dimensional
highly cross-linked network. While $\kappa$ for PAA-PAP blends remain almost
invariant with $\phi_{PAP}$, PAA-PAM systems show improved $\kappa$ with
increasing PAM concentration and also with respect to PAA-PAP blends.
Consistent with the theoretical prediction for the thermal transport of
amorphous polymers, we show that $\kappa$ is proportional to the materials
stiffness, i.e., the bulk modulus K and sound velocity v of PAA-PAM blends.

non-expert users to recognize organ shape such as tongue surface (dorsum). To
alleviate this difficulty for quantitative analysis of tongue shape and motion,
tongue surface can be extracted, tracked, and visualized instead of the whole

subjective, and error-prone task. Furthermore, the rapidity and complexity of
tongue gestures have made it a challenging task, and manual segmentation is not

been addressed by adding explicit external control. In contrast, generative
models are able to capture a distribution over multiple renditions and thus
produce varied renditions using sampling. Typical neural TTS models learn the
average of the data because they minimise mean squared error. In the context of
prosody, taking the average produces flatter, more boring speech: an ""average
prosody"". A generative model that can synthesise multiple prosodies will, by
design, not model average prosody. We use variational autoencoders (VAEs) which
explicitly place the most ""average"" data close to the mean of the Gaussian
prior. We propose that by moving towards the tails of the prior distribution,
the model will transition towards generating more idiosyncratic, varied
renditions. Focusing here on intonation, we investigate the trade-off between
naturalness and intonation variation and find that typical acoustic models can
either be natural, or varied, but not both. However, sampling from the tails of
the VAE prior produces much more varied intonation than the traditional
approaches, whilst maintaining the same level of naturalness.

PSO167-13. The companion galaxy was first detected as a [C II] emitter by ALMA.
An X-ray source is significantly ($P=0.9996$) detected by $Chandra$ in the 2-5
keV band, with $<1.14$ net counts in the 0.5-2 keV band, although the current
positional uncertainty does not allow a conclusive association with either
PSO167-13 or its companion galaxy. From X-ray photometry and hardness-ratio
arguments, we estimated an obscuring column density of
$N_H>2\times10^{24}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ and
$N_H>6\times10^{23}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ at $68\%$ and $90\%$ confidence levels,
respectively. Thus, regardless of which of the two galaxies is associated with
the X-ray emission, this source is the first heavily obscured QSO candidate at
$z>6$.

have typically considered the kernel weights without any constraint. In this
paper, we propose to investigate the impact of a symmetry constraint in
convolutional layers for image classification tasks, taking our inspiration
from the processes involved in the primary visual cortex and common image
processing techniques. The goal is to assess the extent to which it is possible
to enforce symmetrical constraints on the filters throughout the training
process of a convolutional neural network (CNN) by modifying the weight update
preformed during the backpropagation algorithm and to evaluate the change in
performance. The main hypothesis of this paper is that the symmetrical
constraint reduces the number of free parameters in the network, and it is able
to achieve near identical performance to the modern methodology of training. In
particular, we address the following cases: x/y-axis symmetry, point
reflection, and anti-point reflection. The performance has been evaluated on
four databases of images. The results support the conclusion that while random
weights offer more freedom to the model, the symmetry constraint provides a
similar level of performance while decreasing substantially the number of free
parameters in the model. Such an approach can be valuable in phase-sensitive
applications that require a linear phase property throughout the feature
extraction process.

the planets orbiting the brightest stars can be determined by ground-based
spectroscopic observations, these observations allow calculation of their
average densities placing constraints on the bulk compositions and internal

enveloped in a H2-He gaseous envelope (gas dwarfs) or contain a significant
amount of multi-component, H2O-dominated ices/fluids (water worlds). Planets in
the mass range of 10-15 Earth masses, if half-ice and half-rock by mass, have

or volume constraints, that must be provided on a layer surrounding the domain
where the nonlocal equations are posed. The challenge arises from the fact
that, in general, data are provided on surfaces (as opposed to volumes) in the

flexible and physically consistent technique for an automatic conversion of
surface (local) data into volumetric data that does not have any constraints on
the geometry of the domain and on the regularity of the nonlocal solution and
that is not tied to any discretization. We show that our formulation is
well-posed and that the limit of the nonlocal solution, as the nonlocality
vanishes, is the local solution corresponding to the available surface data.
Quadratic convergence rates are proved for the strong energy and L-2
convergence. We illustrate the theory with one dimensional numerical tests

relates to optimal in-field routing for full and partial field coverage with
arbitrary non-convex fields and multiple obstacle areas. It is distinguished
between nine different in-field routing tasks: two for full-field coverage,
seven for partial-field coverage and one for shortest path planning between any
two vertices of the transition graph. It differentiates between equal or
different start and end vertices for a task, coverage of only a subset of
vertices, and a subset of edges or combinations. The proposed methods are
developed primarily for applying sprays and fertilisers with larger operating
widths and with fields where there is unique headland path. Partial field
coverage where, e.g., only a specific subset of edges has to be covered is
relevant for precision agriculture and also for optimised logistical operation
of smaller-sized machinery with limited loading capacities. The result of this
research is the proposition of two compatible algorithms for optimal full and
partial field coverage path planning, respectively. These are evaluated on
three real-world fields to demonstrate their characteristics and computational
efficiency.

photoevaporation has truncated the disc at several AU, creating a pressure trap
which is dust-rich. Previous models predicted this phase could be long-lived
(~Myr), contrary to the observational constraints. We show that dust in the
pressure trap can be removed from the disc by radiation pressure exerting a
significant acceleration, and hence radial velocity, on small dust particles
that reside in the surface layers of the disc. The dust in the pressure trap is
not subject to radial drift so it can grow to reach sizes large enough to
fragment. Hence small particles removed from the surface layers are replaced by
the fragments of larger particles. This link means radiation pressure can
deplete the dust at all particle sizes. Through a combination of 1D and 2D
models, along with secular models that follow the disc's long-term evolution,
we show that radiation pressure can deplete dust from pressure traps created by
photoevaporation in ~1e5 years, while the photoevaporation created cavity still
resides at 10s of AU. After this phase of radiation pressure removal of dust,
the disc is gas-rich and dust depleted and radially optically thin to stellar
light, having observational signatures similar to a gas-rich, young debris
disc. Indeed many of the young stars (~<10 Myr old) classified as hosting a
debris disc may rather be discs that have undergone this process.

understanding of the cell. Recently, algorithms based on Direct Coupling
Analysis (DCA) pairwise maximum-entropy models have allowed to identify
interaction partners among paralogous proteins from sequence data. This success
of DCA at predicting protein-protein interactions could be mainly based on its
known ability to identify pairs of residues that are in contact in the
three-dimensional structure of protein complexes and that coevolve to remain
physicochemically complementary. However, interacting proteins possess similar
evolutionary histories. What is the role of purely phylogenetic correlations in
the performance of DCA-based methods to infer interaction partners? To address
this question, we employ controlled synthetic data that only involve phylogeny
and no interactions or contacts. We find that DCA accurately identifies the
pairs of synthetic sequences that share evolutionary history. While
phylogenetic correlations confound the identification of contacting residues by
DCA, they are thus useful to predict interacting partners among paralogs. We
find that DCA performs as well as phylogenetic methods to this end, and
slightly better than them with large and accurate training sets. Employing DCA
or phylogenetic methods within an Iterative Pairing Algorithm (IPA) allows to
predict pairs of evolutionary partners without a training set. We demonstrate
the ability of these various methods to correctly predict pairings among real
paralogous proteins with genome proximity but no known physical interaction,
illustrating the importance of phylogenetic correlations in natural data.
However, for physically interacting and strongly coevolving proteins, DCA and
mutual information outperform phylogenetic methods. We discuss how to
distinguish physically interacting proteins from those only sharing
evolutionary history.

into latent variable models, mitigating limitations of traditional linear
factor models. VAEs are typically trained by maximizing the likelihood (MLE) of
users interacting with ground-truth items. While simple and often effective,
MLE-based training does not directly maximize the recommendation-quality
metrics one typically cares about, such as top-N ranking. In this paper we
investigate new methods for training collaborative filtering models based on
actor-critic reinforcement learning, to directly optimize the
non-differentiable quality metrics of interest. Specifically, we train a critic

(represented here by a VAE) to directly optimize against the learned metrics.
In contrast to traditional learning-to-rank methods that require to re-run the
optimization procedure for new lists, our critic-based method amortizes the
scoring process with a neural network, and can directly provide the
(approximate) ranking scores for new lists. Empirically, we show that the

of neural networks, and hence comprise a significant component in the
impressive test results found in a number of applications. Introducing
stochasticity is key to their success in practical problems, and there is some
understanding of the role of stochastic gradient descent in this context.
Momentum modifications of gradient descent such as Polyak's Heavy Ball method
(HB) and Nesterov's method of accelerated gradients (NAG), are also widely
adopted. In this work our focus is on understanding the role of momentum in the
training of neural networks, concentrating on the common situation in which the
momentum contribution is fixed at each step of the algorithm. To expose the
ideas simply we work in the deterministic setting.
  Our approach is to derive continuous time approximations of the discrete
algorithms; these continuous time approximations provide insights into the
mechanisms at play within the discrete algorithms. We prove three such
approximations. Firstly we show that standard implementations of fixed momentum
methods approximate a time-rescaled gradient descent flow, asymptotically as
the learning rate shrinks to zero; this result does not distinguish momentum
methods from pure gradient descent, in the limit of vanishing learning rate. We
then proceed to prove two results aimed at understanding the observed practical
advantages of fixed momentum methods over gradient descent. We achieve this by
proving approximations to continuous time limits in which the small but fixed
learning rate appears as a parameter. Furthermore in a third result we show
that the momentum methods admit an exponentially attractive invariant manifold
on which the dynamics reduces, approximately, to a gradient flow with respect
to a modified loss function.

an inference of their stellar masses, the SFRs are similar, in both the mean

epoch. Thus, there is no evidence for a systematic enhancement or suppression
(i.e., regulation or quenching) of star formation in the hosts of the most
luminous quasars at $z\sim2$. These results are consistent with the Magneticum
cosmological simulation, while in disagreement with a widely recognized
phenomenological model that predicts higher SFRs than observed here based on
the high bolometric luminosities of this sample. Furthermore, there is only a
weak relation between SFR and accretion rate onto their supermassive black

promising trajectories are usually difficult to explore. Furthermore,
considering the diversity of problem complexity, we explore automated
curriculum learning (CL) for weak supervision to accelerate exploration and
learning. We evaluate the proposed approach on real-world user logs of a
commercial voice ordering system. Results demonstrate that when trained on a

Automated CL leads to better generalization and further improves the test set

M3D-based network-on-chip (NoC) architectures can exploit these benefits by
adopting tier partitioning for intra-router stages. However, conventional
fabrication methods are infeasible for M3D-enabled designs due to temperature
related issues. This has necessitated lower temperature and
temperature-resilient techniques for M3D fabrication, leading to inferior
performance of transistors in the top tier and interconnects in the bottom
tier. The resulting inter-tier process variation leads to performance
degradation of M3D-enabled NoCs. In this work, we demonstrate that without
considering inter-tier process variation, an M3D-enabled NoC architecture
overestimates the energy-delay-product (EDP) on average by 50.8% for a set of
SPLASH-2 and PARSEC benchmarks. As a countermeasure, we adopt a process

distribute the intra-router stages and inter-router links among the tiers to
mitigate the adverse effects of process variation. Experimental results show

morbidity associated with air pollution. The objective of the study is to
determine if exposure of human participants to anticipated levels of sulfuric

effect on respiratory function. We used data from 28 adults exposed to sulfuric
acid for 4 hours in a controlled exposure chamber over a 3 day period with
repeated measures of pulmonary function (FEV1) recorded at 2-hour intervals.
Measurements were also recorded after 2 and 24 hours post exposure. We
formulated a linear mixed effect model for FEV1 with fixed effects (day of
treatment, hour, day-hour interaction, and smoking status), a random intercept
and an AR1 covariance structure to estimate the effect of aerosol exposure on
FEV1. We further assessed whether smoking status modified the exposure effects
and compared the analysis to the method used by Kerr et al.,1981. The findings
of the study show that the effect of day 3 exposure is negatively associated
with lung function (coefficient ($\beta$), -0.08; 95% CI, -0.16 to -0.01). A
weak negative association is also observed with increasing hours of exposure
($\beta$, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.00). Among the smokers, we found a
significant negative association with hours of exposure ($\beta$, -0.02; 95%
CI, -0.03 to -0.00), day 3 exposure ($\beta$, -0.11; 95% CI, -0.14 to -0.02)
and a borderline adverse effect for day 2 treatment ($\beta$, -0.06; 95% CI,
-0.14 to 0.03) whilst no significant association was observed for nonsmokers.
In conclusion, anticipated deposits of sulfuric acid aerosol in the near would
adversely affect respiratory function. The effect observed in smokers is
significantly more adverse than in nonsmokers.

theory to describe the thermodynamics of these systems. We first focus on
moderate thermo-electrical biases and low driving frequencies. For this linear
response regime, we establish generalized Onsager-Casimir relations and an
extended fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Furthermore, we derive a family of
thermodynamic bounds proving that any local matter or heat current puts a
non-trivial lower limit on the overall dissipation rate of a coherent transport
process. These bounds do not depend on system-specific parameters, are robust
against dephasing and involve only experimentally accessible quantities. They
thus provide powerful tools to optimize the performance of mesoscopic devices
and for thermodynamic inference, as we demonstrate by working out three
specific applications. We then show that physically transparent extensions of
our bounds hold also for strong biases and high frequencies. These generalized
bounds imply a thermodynamic uncertainty relation that fully accounts for
quantum effects and periodic driving. Moreover, they lead to a universal and
operationally accessible bound on entropy production that can be readily used
for thermodynamic inference and device engineering far from equilibrium.
Connecting a broad variety of topics that range from thermodynamic geometry
over thermodynamic uncertainty relations to quantum engineering, our work
provides a unifying thermodynamic theory of coherent transport that can be

galaxy samples selected according to stellar mass or star formation rate (SFR).
We develop three different schemes to populate haloes with galaxies with
increasing complexity, considering the scatter of the satellite HOD as an
additional parameter in the modelling. We first modify the SAM output, removing
assembly bias and using a standard Navarro-Frenk-White density profile for the
satellite galaxies as the target to reproduce with our HOD mocks. We find that
all models give similar reproductions of the two-halo contribution to the
clustering signal, but there are differences in the one-halo term. In
particular, the HOD mock reproductions work equally well using either the HOD
of central and satellites separately or using a model that also accounts for
whether or not the haloes contain a central galaxy. We find that the HOD
scatter does not have an important impact on the clustering predictions for
stellar mass selected samples. For SFR selections, we obtain the most accurate
results assuming a negative binomial distribution for the number of satellites
in a halo. The scatter in the satellites HOD is a key consideration for HOD
mock catalogues that mimic ELG or SFR selected samples in future galaxy
surveys.

only marginally at 233 GHz ($20 \pm 8~\mu{\rm Jy}$), about 40 days later. These
results suggest either an optically thin sub-mm synchrotron spectrum, or highly
variable sub-mm jet emission on month timescales. Although the latter appears
more likely, we note that, at the time of the ALMA observations, A0620-00 was
in a somewhat less active optical-IR state than during all published
multi-wavelength campaigns when a flat-spectrum, partially self-absorbed jet
has been suggested to extend from the radio to the mid-IR regime. Either
interpretation is viable in the context of an internal shock model, where the
jet's spectral shape and variability are set by the power density spectrum of
the shells' Lorentz factor fluctuations. While strictly simultaneous
radio-mm-IR observations are necessary to draw definitive conclusions for
A0620-00, the data presented here, in combination with recent radio and sub-mm
results from higher luminosity systems, demonstrate that jets from black hole
X-ray binaries exhibit a high level of variability - either in flux density or
intrinsic spectral shape, or both - across a wide spectrum of Eddington ratios.
This is not in contrast with expectations from an internal shock model, where
lower jet power systems can be expected to exhibit larger fractional
variability owing to an overall decrease in synchrotron absorption.

been used for delineating and tracking tongue dorsum. Deep convolutional neural
networks (DCNNs), which have shown to be successful in medical image analysis
tasks, are typically weak for the same task on different domains. In many

Domain adaptation is an alternative solution for this difficulty by
transferring the weights from the model trained on a large annotated legacy

segmentation tasks. With the lateral skip connection, the models can obtain and
fuse both semantic and resolution information in deep layers to achieve more
accurate segmentation performance. However, in many applications (e.g., blurry
boundary images), these models often cannot precisely locate complex boundaries
and segment tiny isolated parts. To solve this challenging problem, we firstly
analyze why simple skip connections are not enough to help accurately locate
indistinct boundaries and argue that it is due to the fuzzy information in the
skip connection provided in the encoder layers. Then we propose a
semantic-guided encoder feature learning strategy to learn both high resolution
and rich semantic encoder features so that we can more accurately locate the
blurry boundaries, which can also enhance the network by selectively learning
discriminative features. Besides, we further propose a soft contour constraint
mechanism to model the blurry boundary detection. Experimental results on real
clinical datasets show that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art
segmentation accuracy, especially for the blurry regions. Further analysis also
indicates that our proposed network components indeed contribute to the
improvement of performance. Experiments on additional datasets validate the
generalization ability of our proposed method.

in many industrial and engineering applications. Atomization in high speed
compressible flows is less well understood than its more frequently studied low
Mach number counterpart. The key to understanding the mechanisms of secondary
atomization is examination of the breakup characteristics and droplet
trajectories across a range of physical conditions. In this study, a planar
shock wave impacting a cylindrical water column ($\rho_l=1000 \rm~kg/m^3$) is
simulated for a range of Weber numbers ranging three orders of magnitude ($\sim
10^0-10^3$). Four different incident shock speeds are simulated ($M_s=1.47, 2,
2.5, 3$) which induce subsonic, transonic, and supersonic crossflow across the
column. The flowfield is solved using a compressible multicomponent
Navier-Stokes solver with capillary forces. Fluid immiscibility is maintained
with an interface sharpening scheme. Overall, a diverse range of complex
interface dynamics are captured across the range of physical conditions
studied. Additionally, while the unsteady drag coefficient of the liquid column
shows a dependence on the Weber number using the undeformed diameter,
calculations using the deformed diameter significantly reduce the dependence,
particularly for the supersonic cases, with implications for subgrid droplet
modeling in atomization simulations. A preliminary under-resolved
three-dimensional simulation of droplet breakup shows reasonable agreement with
experimental data, indicating the potential of the numerical approach for
future investigations.

models. Such models describe the correlations between entangled particles as
mediated by intermediate parameters which track the particle world-lines and
respect Lorentz covariance. These locally-mediated models require the
relaxation of an arrow-of-time assumption which is typically taken for granted.
Specifically, some of the mediating parameters in these models must
functionally depend on measurement settings in their future, i.e., on input
parameters associated with later times. This option (often called
""retrocausal"") has been repeatedly pointed out in the literature, but the
exploration of explicit locally-mediated toy-models capable of describing
specific entanglement phenomena has begun only in the past decade. A brief
survey of such models is included here. These models provide a continuous and
consistent description of events associated with spacetime locations, with
aspects that are solved ""all-at-once"" rather than unfolding from the past to
the future. The tension between quantum mechanics and relativity which is
usually associated with Bell's Theorem does not occur here. Unlike conventional
quantum models, the number of parameters needed to specify the state of a
system does not grow exponentially with the number of entangled particles. The
promise of generalizing such models to account for all quantum phenomena is
identified as a grand challenge.

$\xi=7/10$ and $\chi = 2/5$, depending only on coarse details of the specific
connectivity laws used. Also, the travel time fluctuations are Gaussian, rather
than Tracy-Widom, which is rarely seen in first passage models. The first class
contains proximity graphs such as the hard and soft random geometric graph, and
the $k$-nearest neighbour random geometric graphs, where via Monte Carlo
simulations we find $\xi=0.60\pm 0.01$ and $\chi = 0.20\pm 0.01$, showing a

machine learning as a result of orthonormality, rank or positivity constraints.
First- and second-order necessary optimality conditions state that the
Riemannian gradient must be zero, and the Riemannian Hessian must be positive
semidefinite. Generalizing Jin et al.'s recent work on perturbed gradient
descent (PGD) for optimization on linear spaces [How to Escape Saddle Points
Efficiently (2017), Stochastic Gradient Descent Escapes Saddle Points
Efficiently (2019)], we propose a version of perturbed Riemannian gradient
descent (PRGD) to show that necessary optimality conditions can be met
approximately with high probability, without evaluating the Hessian.
Specifically, for an arbitrary Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{M}$ of dimension
$d$, a sufficiently smooth (possibly non-convex) objective function $f$, and
under weak conditions on the retraction chosen to move on the manifold, with
high probability, our version of PRGD produces a point with gradient smaller
than $\epsilon$ and Hessian within $\sqrt{\epsilon}$ of being positive
semidefinite in $O((\log{d})^4 / \epsilon^{2})$ gradient queries. This matches
the complexity of PGD in the Euclidean case. Crucially, the dependence on
dimension is low. This matters for large-scale applications including PCA and
low-rank matrix completion, which both admit natural formulations on manifolds.
The key technical idea is to generalize PRGD with a distinction between two
types of gradient steps: ""steps on the manifold"" and ""perturbed steps in a
tangent space of the manifold."" Ultimately, this distinction makes it possible
to extend Jin et al.'s analysis seamlessly.

As we prove in good accordance with our numerical tests, already at a single

enhancing the power of sketching by means of using leverage scores.

'90), we revisit building cryptography based on group actions. Several previous
candidates for one-way group actions no longer stand, due to progress both on
classical algorithms (e.g., graph isomorphism) and quantum algorithms (e.g.,
discrete logarithm).
  We propose the general linear group action on tensors as a new candidate to
build cryptography based on group actions. Recent works
(Futorny--Grochow--Sergeichuk, Lin. Alg. Appl., 2019) suggest that the
underlying algorithmic problem, the tensor isomorphism problem, is the hardest
one among several isomorphism testing problems arising from areas including
coding theory, computational group theory, and multivariate cryptography. We
present evidence to justify the viability of this proposal from comprehensive
study of the state-of-art heuristic algorithms, theoretical algorithms, and
hardness results, as well as quantum algorithms.
  We then introduce a new notion called pseudorandom group actions to further
develop group-action based cryptography. Briefly speaking, given a group $G$
acting on a set $S$, we assume that it is hard to distinguish two distributions
of $(s, t)$ either uniformly chosen from $S\times S$, or where $s$ is randomly
chosen from $S$ and $t$ is the result of applying a random group action of
$g\in G$ on $s$. This subsumes the classical decisional Diffie-Hellman
assumption when specialized to a particular group action. We carefully analyze
various attack strategies that support the general linear group action on
tensors as a candidate for this assumption.
  Finally, we establish the quantum security of several cryptographic
primitives based on the one-way group action assumption and the pseudorandom
group action assumption.

mitigate this discrepancy between train and test time by randomly replacing

leads to equivalent or better performance on image generation, summarization,

presence of this large degeneracy in the ground states, in contrast to the

plateau in the entropy at intermediate temperatures, indicating the existence
of the spin fractionalization. Deducing the entropy in the mixed-spin system

unidirectional spin configuration is preserved in the out-of-plane direction

the [110]-oriented quantum well. Our first-principle calculations on various MX

unsupervised domain adaptation include: (a) maximizing performance on the
target, and (b) aligning the source and target domains. Traditionally, these
tasks have either been considered as separate, or assumed to be implicitly
addressed together with high-capacity feature extractors. When considered
separately, alignment is usually viewed as a problem of aligning data
distributions, either through geometric approaches such as subspace alignment
or through distributional alignment such as optimal transport. This paper
represents a hybrid approach, where we assume simplified data geometry in the
form of subspaces, and consider alignment as an auxiliary task to the primary
task of maximizing performance on the source. The alignment is made rather
simple by leveraging tractable data geometry in the form of subspaces. We
synergistically allow certain parameters derived from the closed-form auxiliary
solution, to be affected by gradients from the primary task. The proposed
approach represents a unique fusion of geometric and model-based alignment with

of people around the world. To identify individuals who are vulnerable to
depression and anxiety, predictive models have been built that typically
utilize data from one source. Unlike these traditional models, in this study,
we leverage a rich heterogeneous data set from the University of Notre Dame's
NetHealth study that collected individuals' (student participants') social
interaction data via smartphones, health-related behavioral data via wearables
(Fitbit), and trait data from surveys. To integrate the different types of
information, we model the NetHealth data as a heterogeneous information network
(HIN). Then, we redefine the problem of predicting individuals' mental health
conditions (depression or anxiety) in a novel manner, as applying to our HIN a
popular paradigm of a recommender system (RS), which is typically used to
predict the preference that a person would give to an item (e.g., a movie or
book). In our case, the items are the individuals' different mental health
states. We evaluate four state-of-the-art RS approaches. Also, we model the
prediction of individuals' mental health as another problem type - that of node
classification (NC) in our HIN, evaluating in the process four node features
under logistic regression as a proof-of-concept classifier. We find that our RS
and NC network methods produce more accurate predictions than a logistic
regression model using the same NetHealth data in the traditional non-network
fashion as well as a random-approach. Also, we find that the best of the
considered RS approaches outperforms all considered NC approaches. This is the
first study to integrate smartphone, wearable sensor, and survey data in an HIN
manner and use RS or NC on the HIN to predict individuals' mental health
conditions.

friendship network was drawn based on the information obtained at the end of
semester 5 and it was investigated based on two metrics namely centrality
measures and Girvan Newman algorithm. At the end of semester 5, grades were
added as the attributes of the network. 12 clusters were found in this batch

option to choose between 2 groups. Group 1 was unperturbed without any

preserved but the students in poor performing clusters were distributed among
performing clusters. The students were then asked to carry out assignments and
quizzes in their respective groups. The final grades indicated that the
performance of the students of Group 1 was much superior and there was clear
evidence that those poor performing students in the 5th semester performed much

analysis of the angle-averaged PNS profiles using results from a general
relativistic CCSN simulation of a $15 M_{\odot}$ star. In this work, we
investigate how the choice of the outer boundary condition could affect the PNS
oscillation modes in the linear analysis. By changing the density at the outer
boundary of the PNS surface in a parametric manner, we show that the
eigenfrequencies strongly depend on the surface density. By comparing with the
gravitational wave (GW) signatures obtained in the hydrodynamics simulation,
the so-called surface $g$-mode of the PNS can be well ascribed to the
fundamental oscillations of the PNS. The frequency of the fundamental
oscillations can be fitted by a function of the mass and radius of the PNS
similar to the case of cold neutron stars. In the case that the position of the
outer boundary is chosen to cover not only the PNS but also the surrounding
postshock region, we obtain the eigenfrequencies close to the modulation
frequencies of the standing accretion-shock instability (SASI). However, we
point out that these oscillation modes are unlikely to have the same physical
origin of the SASI modes seen in the hydrodynamics simulation. We discuss
possible limitations of applying the angle-averaged, linear perturbation
analysis to extract the full ingredients of the CCSN GW signatures.

model-based approaches lead to `compounding errors' when the model is unrolled
step by step. Essentially, the state transitions that the learner predicts (by
unrolling the model for multiple steps) and the state transitions that the
learner experiences (by acting in the environment) may not be consistent. There
is enough evidence that humans build a model of the environment, not only by
observing the environment but also by interacting with the environment.
Interaction with the environment allows humans to carry out experiments: taking
actions that help uncover true causal relationships which can be used for
building better dynamics models. Analogously, we would expect such interactions
to be helpful for a learning agent while learning to model the environment
dynamics. In this paper, we build upon this intuition by using an auxiliary
cost function to ensure consistency between what the agent observes (by acting
in the real world) and what it imagines (by acting in the `learned' world). We
consider several tasks - Mujoco based control tasks and Atari games - and show

examine the impact of popular seed set selection strategies in active learning,

strategies against well-researched continuous active learning strategies for
the purpose of determining efficient training methods for classifying large
populations quickly and precisely. We study how random sampling, keyword models
and clustering based seed set selection strategies combined together with
top-ranked, uncertain, random, recall inspired, and hybrid active learning
document selection strategies affect the performance of active learning for
predictive coding. We use the percentage of documents requiring review to reach
75% recall as the ""benchmark"" metric to evaluate and compare our approaches. In
most cases we find that seed set selection methods have a minor impact, though
they do show significant impact in lower richness data sets or when choosing a
top-ranked active learning selection strategy. Our results also show that
active learning selection strategies implementing uncertainty, random, or 75%
recall selection strategies has the potential to reach the optimum active
learning round much earlier than the popular continuous active learning

bands. 802.11ad and WiGig are wireless technologies that currently use the 60
GHz unlicensed mmWave spectrum via beamforming techniques. It is likely that 5G
systems will be considered for 60GHz unlicensed spectrum (apart from other
unlicensed bands) deployments and hence must co-exist with 802.11ad and WiGig.
3GPP is taking steps towards achieving the same and the standardization for
this is underway. The first step to achieve this co-existence is to find the
interference-free directions, in other words identify the directions in which
the nodes using these incumbent technologies are communicating and eliminate
those directions from further communications. Such a mechanism can help to
exploit the spatial holes rather than avoid communications even when only a few
spatial directions are used by incumbents. Such a mechanism trivially increases
the throughput of the proposed 5G systems. However, since the incumbent
technologies may be unknown to the 5G mmWave nodes and their behavior may also
be unknown apriori (for instance, parameters such as duty cycle, power levels,
CSMA parameter used by 802.11ad are unknown to the 5G nodes), this spatial
direction finding must be performed in a blind manner. In this paper, we use
multi-armed bandits-based algorithms, a variant of machine learning algorithms,
to blindly detect the beam directions (both along azimuth and elevation i.e.,
3D-beamforming) used for communication by the incumbents. This work paves the
way for combining the powerful of machine learning algorithms into 5G
unlicensed mmWave systems. Numerical results show the superior performance of
these algorithms over techniques that are commonly employed in such blind

of video content, which has drawn a lot of attention recent years. Generating
accurate and fine-grained captions needs to not only understand the global
content of video, but also capture the detailed object information. Meanwhile,
video representations have great impact on the quality of generated captions.
Thus, it is important for video captioning to capture salient objects with
their detailed temporal dynamics, and represent them using discriminative
spatio-temporal representations. In this paper, we propose a new video
captioning approach based on object-aware aggregation with bidirectional
temporal graph (OA-BTG), which captures detailed temporal dynamics for salient
objects in video, and learns discriminative spatio-temporal representations by
performing object-aware local feature aggregation on detected object regions.
The main novelties and advantages are: (1) Bidirectional temporal graph: A
bidirectional temporal graph is constructed along and reversely along the
temporal order, which provides complementary ways to capture the temporal
trajectories for each salient object. (2) Object-aware aggregation: Learnable
VLAD (Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors) models are constructed on
object temporal trajectories and global frame sequence, which performs
object-aware aggregation to learn discriminative representations. A
hierarchical attention mechanism is also developed to distinguish different
contributions of multiple objects. Experiments on two widely-used datasets
demonstrate our OA-BTG achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of

enabling intelligent transportation and ensuring the security and safety of the

license plates can have extremely diverse sizes, fonts and colors, and the
plate images are usually of poor quality caused by skewed capturing angles,
uneven lighting, occlusion, and blurring. In applications such as surveillance,
it often requires fast processing. To enable real-time and accurate license
plate recognition, in this work, we propose a set of techniques: 1) a contour
reconstruction method along with edge-detection to quickly detect the candidate
plates; 2) a simple zero-one-alternation scheme to effectively remove the fake
top and bottom borders around plates to facilitate more accurate segmentation
of characters on plates; 3) a set of techniques to augment the training data,
incorporate SIFT features into the CNN network, and exploit transfer learning
to obtain the initial parameters for more effective training; and 4) a
two-phase verification procedure to determine the correct plate at low cost, a
statistical filtering in the plate detection stage to quickly remove unwanted
candidates, and the accurate CR results after the CR process to perform further
plate verification without additional processing. We implement a complete LPDR
system based on our algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that our
system can accurately recognize license plate in real-time. Additionally, it
works robustly under various levels of illumination and noise, and in the
presence of car movement. Compared to peer schemes, our system is not only

a lower value than its neighbor's. This result is akin to a speed-accuracy
tradeoff, where the penalty of lowering the decision threshold is choice
inaccuracy while the benefit is that earlier decisions have a higher
probability of influencing the other member. We numerically extend these

appropriate parameters, a small but vocal component of the population can have
a large amount of influence on the total system.

proposed method achieves the end-to-end training instead of the separated

CVCs arising upon contact transition to the superconducting state
(superconducting spectral component) is formed not only near the constriction
in the region roughly equal to the contact diameter (as is the case for the
normal state, and as predicted theoretically for the superconducting state),
but also in a markedly larger region that is about the size of the coherence
length. In this case, a considerable role in the formation of this
superconducting component is played by nonequilibrium phonons with low group
velocity, which account for the experimentally observed sharpening of the
phonon peaks in the EPI spectra (the second derivatives of the CVCs) during the
superconducting transition of the contacts, instead of the theoretically
expected peak broadening (spreading), and for the increase in the
superconducting contribution to the point contact spectrum in the low and
medium energy regions. The high-energy part of the EPI spectrum changes much
less significantly during the superconducting transition, which is attributable
to suppression of the excess contact current by nonequilibrium quasi-particles.
A detailed procedure was proposed for the recovery of the EPI spectral function
from the point contact spectrum contribution (the second derivative of the CVC)
that arises during the superconducting transition of one or both contacting
metals.

viscous friction in the sense that without power expenditure they quickly come

""Stokesian"" (viscous; zero Reynolds number) limit, the motion is governed by a
reduced order ""connection"" model that describes how body shape change produces
motion for the body frame with respect to the world. In the ""perturbed Stokes
regime"" where inertial forces are still dominated by viscosity, but are not
negligible (low Reynolds number), we show that motion is still governed by a
functional relationship between shape velocity and body velocity, but this
function is no longer linear in shape change rate. We derive this model using
results from singular perturbation theory, and the theory of noncompact

  Using the theoretical properties of this reduced-order model, we develop an

shape change (a ""gait"") directly from observational data of shape and body

handle the streaming recommendation problem. The framework jointly combines
stochastic processes and deep factorization models under a Bayesian paradigm to
model the generation and evolution of users' preferences and items'

  boundaries under instantaneous and static perturbation","73 pages",,,,"math.DS nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When dynamical systems that produce rhythmic behaviors operate within hard
limits, they may exhibit limit cycles with sliding components, that is, closed
isolated periodic orbits that make and break contact with a constraint surface.
Examples include heel-ground interaction in locomotion, firing rate
rectification in neural networks and stick-slip oscillators. In many rhythmic
systems, robustness against external perturbations involves response of both
the shape and the timing of the limit cycle trajectory. The existing methods of
infinitesimal phase response curve (iPRC) and variational analysis are well
established for quantifying changes in timing and shape for smooth systems.
These tools have recently been extended to nonsmooth dynamics with transversal
crossing boundaries. In this work, we further extend the iPRC method to
nonsmooth systems with sliding components, which enables us to make predictions
about the synchronization properties of weakly coupled stick-slip oscillators.
We observe a new feature of the isochrons in a planar limit cycle with hard
sliding boundaries. Moreover, the classical variational analysis neglects
timing information and is restricted to instantaneous perturbations. By
defining the ""infinitesimal shape response curve"" (iSRC), we incorporate timing
sensitivity of an oscillator to describe the shape response of this oscillator
to parametric perturbations. In order to extract timing information, we also
develop a ""local timing response curve"" (lTRC) that measures the timing
sensitivity of a limit cycle within any given region. We demonstrate in a
specific example that taking into account local timing sensitivity in a
nonsmooth system greatly improves the accuracy of the iSRC over global timing
analysis given by the iPRC.

electrons based on symmetry. We begin with a scheme to systematically derive
the irreducible representations (IRs) characterizing the Bloch functions.
Starting from a tight-binding (TB) approach, we decompose the TB basis
functions into localized symmetry-adapted atomic orbitals and crystal-periodic
symmetry-adapted plane waves. Each of these subproblems is independent of the
details of a particular crystal structure and it is largely independent of the
other subproblem, hence permitting for each subproblem an independent universal
solution. Taking monolayer MoS$_2$ and few-layer graphene as examples, we
tabulate the symmetrized $p$ and $d$ orbitals as well as the symmetrized plane
wave spinors for these systems. The symmetry-adapted basis functions
block-diagonalize the TB Hamiltonian such that each block yields eigenstates
transforming according to one of the IRs of the group of the wave vector $G_k$.
For many crystal structures, it is possible to define multiple distinct
coordinate systems such that for wave vectors $k$ at the border of the
Brillouin zone the IRs characterizing the Bloch states depend on the coordinate
system, i.e., these IRs of $G_k$ are not uniquely determined by the symmetry of
a crystal structure. The different coordinate systems are related by a
coordinate shift that results in a rearrangement of the IRs of $G_k$
characterizing the Bloch states. We illustrate this rearrangement with three
coordinate systems for MoS$_2$ and tri-layer graphene. Using monolayer MoS$_2$
as an example, we combine the symmetry analysis of its bulk Bloch states with
the theory of invariants to construct a generic multiband Hamiltonian for
electrons near the $K$ point of the Brillouin zone. The Hamiltonian includes
the effect of spin-orbit coupling, strain and external electric and magnetic
fields.

change points by suitably filtering this space down. Critically, we reframe the
problem as that of variable selection in the change point parameters, this
enables the filtering down process to be achieved in a single step with the aid
of an $\ell_0$ regularization, thus avoiding the sequentiality of binary
segmentation. We study this method under a high dimensional multiple change
point linear regression model and show that rates convergence of the error in
the regression and change point estimates are near optimal. We propose a
simulated annealing (SA) approach to implement a key finite state space
discrete optimization that arises in our method. Theoretical results are
numerically supported via simulations. The proposed method is shown to possess
the ability to agnostically detect the `no change' scenario. Furthermore, its
computational complexity is of order $O(Np^2)$+SA, where SA is the cost of a SA
optimization on a $N$(no. of change points) dimensional grid. Thus, the

observations with Suzaku in 2006 and 2009, the 1-10 keV flux showed a decrease

differences of $kT$ and $N_{\rm H}$ being within 10% of each other. Through
timing analysis, we found that the rotation period of SGR 1900+14 on 2016

period shows a monotonic decrease in the spin-down rate $\dot{P}$ lasting for
more than 15 years. We also found a characteristic behavior of the hard-tail
power-law component of SGR 1900+14. The energy-dependent pulse profiles vary in
morphology with a boundary of 10 keV. The phase-resolved spectra show the
differences between photon indices ($\Gamma=1.02$-$1.44$) as a function of the
pulse phase. Furthermore, the photon index is positively correlated with the
X-ray flux of the hard power-law component, which could not be resolved by the
previous hard X-ray observations.

large set of 2D projections is generated using the protein visualization
software Jmol. This set of multi-view 2D representations includes 13 different
types of protein visualizations that emphasize specific properties of protein
structure (e.g., a backbone visualization that displays the backbone structure
of the protein as a trace of the C{\alpha} atom). Each type of representation
is used to train a different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and the fusion
of these CNNs is shown to be able to exploit the diversity of different types
of representations to improve classification performance. In addition, several
multi-view projections are obtained by uniformly rotating the protein structure
around its central X, Y, and Z viewing axes to produce 125 images. This
approach can be considered a data augmentation method for improving the
performance of the classifier and can be used in both the training and the

significance of a coronary artery stenosis needs to be determined to guide

measurement, performed during invasive coronary angiography (ICA). We present a
method for automatic and non-invasive detection of patients requiring ICA,
employing deep unsupervised analysis of complete coronary arteries in cardiac
CT angiography (CCTA) images. We retrospectively collected CCTA scans of 187
patients, 137 of them underwent invasive FFR measurement in 192 different
coronary arteries. These FFR measurements served as a reference standard for
the functional significance of the coronary stenosis. The centerlines of the
coronary arteries were extracted and used to reconstruct straightened
multi-planar reformatted (MPR) volumes. To automatically identify arteries with
functionally significant stenosis that require ICA, each MPR volume was encoded
into a fixed number of encodings using two disjoint 3D and 1D convolutional
autoencoders performing spatial and sequential encodings, respectively.
Thereafter, these encodings were employed to classify arteries using a support
vector machine classifier. The detection of coronary arteries requiring
invasive evaluation, evaluated using repeated cross-validation experiments,
resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of $0.81
\pm 0.02$ on the artery-level, and $0.87 \pm 0.02$ on the patient-level. The
results demonstrate the feasibility of automatic non-invasive detection of
patients that require ICA and possibly subsequent coronary artery intervention.
This could potentially reduce the number of patients that unnecessarily undergo

cons of using Ethereum MainNet, the public Ethereum blockchain, as a
Coordination Blockchain. The requirements Ethereum MainNet needs to fulfil to
perform this role are discussed within the context of Ethereum Private
Sidechains, a private blockchain technology which allows many blockchains to be
operated in parallel, and allows atomic crosschain transactions to execute
across blockchains. Ethereum MainNet is a permissionless network which aims to
offer strong authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation properties, that
incentivises good behaviour using crypto economics. This paper demonstrates
that Ethereum MainNet does deliver these properties. It then provides a
comprehensive review of the features of Ethereum Private Sidechains, with a
focus on the potential usage of Coordination Blockchains for these features.
Finally, the merits of using Ethereum MainNet as a Coordination Blockchain are
assessed. For Ethereum Private Sidechains, we found that Ethereum MainNet is
best suited to storing long term static data that needs to be widely available,
such as the Ethereum Registration Authority information. However, due to
Ethereum MainNet's probabilistic finality, it is not well suited to information
that needs to be available and acted upon immediately, such as the Sidechain
Public Keys and Atomic Crosschain Transaction state information that need to be
accessible prior to the first atomic crosschain transaction being issued on a

discussions and observations of the typical tasks a Coordination blockchain may
be expected to perform are applicable more widely to any multi-blockchain

Systems (ASs) operated by independent organizations; each AS having a very
limited view outside its own network. These complexities and limitations impede
network operators to finely pinpoint the causes of service degradation or
disruption when the problem lies outside of their network. In this paper, we
present Chocolatine, a solution to detect remote connectivity loss using
Internet Background Radiation (IBR) through a simple and efficient method. IBR
is unidirectional unsolicited Internet traffic, which is easily observed by
monitoring unused address space. IBR features two remarkable properties: it is
originated worldwide, across diverse ASs, and it is incessant. We show that the
number of IP addresses observed from an AS or a geographical area follows a
periodic pattern. Then, using Seasonal ARIMA to statistically model IBR data,
we predict the number of IPs for the next time window. Significant deviations
from these predictions indicate an outage. We evaluated Chocolatine using data
from the UCSD Network Telescope, operated by CAIDA, with a set of documented
outages. Our experiments show that the proposed methodology achieves a good
trade-off between true-positive rate (90%) and false-positive rate (2%) and
largely outperforms CAIDA's own IBR-based detection method. Furthermore,
performing a comparison against other methods, i.e., with BGP monitoring and
active probing, we observe that Chocolatine shares a large common set of
outages with them in addition to many specific outages that would otherwise go
undetected.

well known, CP transformation is not a symmetry of the system anywhere on the

transformation, we observe that the Dirac Hamiltonian is odd under the new
transformation precisely at the sphaleron, and this ensures the mirror symmetry
of the spectrum, including the continua. As a consistency check, we show that
the fermionic zero mode presented by Ringwald in the sphaleron background is
invariant under the new transformation. The spectral mirror symmetry which we
establish here, together with the presence of the zero mode, are the two
necessary conditions whence the fermion number $\frac{1}{2}$ of the sphaleron
can be inferred using the reasoning presented by Jackiw and Rebbi or,
equivalently, using the spectral deficiency $\frac{1}{2}$ of the Dirac sea. The

from X-ray data obtained from the {\it Suzaku} satellite, arising from a
possible interaction of ALPs with the direction-dependent Earth's magnetic

with the integrated Earth's magnetic strength in the direction of each target
field at each observation epoch, which amounts to $10^2$ Tm-a value greater
than that achieved by terrestrial experiments due to the large coherent length.
From the detailed analysis, we did not find evidence of the XDB confidence

99 % confidence level upper limit on a possible residual contribution to the
cosmic X-ray background (CXB) surface brightness to be $1.6\times 10^{-9}~{\rm

guaranteed by regularization terms added to the reference Hamiltonian, followed
by a rescaling of time with use of a large scaling factor. With help of the
regularization terms consisting of pair-wise and 3-body interactions, we apply
the proposed formula (Phys. Rev.A 96, 052106(2017)) to regular triangle and
open linear chain for N = 3 spin systems, and to triangular pyramid, square,
primary star graph and open linear chain for N = 4 spin systems. The
geometry-induced symmetry greatly decreases the rank of coefficient matrix of
the linear algebraic equation for regularization terms. Choosing a transverse
Ising Hamiltonian as a reference, we find: (1) for N = 3 spin clusters, the
driving interaction consists of only the geometry-dependent pairwise
interactions and there is no need for the 3-body interaction; (2) for N = 4
spin clusters, the geometry-dependent pair-wise interactions again constitute
major part of the driving interaction, whereas the universal 3-body interaction
free from the geometry is necessary but plays a subsidiary role. Our scheme
predicts the practical driving interaction in accelerating the adiabatic

super-resolution, in this paper, we observe that a coarse enough image
down-sampled from a blurry observation is approximately a low-resolution
version of the latent sharp image. We prove this phenomenon theoretically and
define the coarse enough image as a latent structure prior of the unknown sharp
image. Starting from this prior, we propose to restore sharp images from the
coarsest scale to the finest scale on a blurry image pyramid, and progressively
update the prior image using the newly restored sharp image. These
coarse-to-fine priors are referred to as \textit{Multi-Scale Latent Structures}
(MSLS). Leveraging the MSLS prior, our algorithm comprises two phases: 1) we
first preliminarily restore sharp images in the coarse scales; 2) we then apply
a refinement process in the finest scale to obtain the final deblurred image.
In each scale, to achieve lower computational complexity, we alternately
perform a sharp image reconstruction with fast local self-example matching, an
accelerated kernel estimation with error compensation, and a fast non-blind
image deblurring, instead of computing any computationally expensive non-convex
priors. We further extend the proposed algorithm to solve more challenging

constancy assumption stating that global spatial information is not relevant

Furthermore, BoCF is consistent with color constancy statistical approaches and
can be interpreted as a learning-based generalization of many statistical
approaches. To further improve the illumination estimation accuracy, we propose
a novel attention mechanism for the BoCF model with two variants based on

lead to explicit formulae determining the stability or instability of the wave
for a wide range of classes of equations. However, these are typically
specialized to a particular equation and checking the stability conditions may
not be not straightforward. We present results for a large class of problems
that reduce the determination of spectral stability of a wave to a simple task
of locating zeros of explicitly constructed polynomials. We study spectral
stability of small-amplitude periodic waves in scalar Hamiltonian problems as a
perturbation of the zero-amplitude case. A necessary condition for stability of
the wave is that the unperturbed spectrum is restricted to the imaginary axis.
Instability can come about through a Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcation, i.e., of a
collision of purely imaginary eigenvalues of the Floquet spectrum of opposite
Krein signature. In recent work on the stability of small-amplitude waves the
dispersion relation of the unperturbed problem was shown to play a central
role. We demonstrate that the dispersion relation provides even more explicit
information about wave stability: we construct a polynomial of half the degree
of the dispersion relation, and its roots directly characterize not only
collisions of eigenvalues at zero-amplitude but also an agreement or a
disagreement of their Krein signatures. Based on this explicit information it
is possible to detect instabilities of non-zero amplitude waves. In our
analysis we stay away from the possible instabilities at the origin of the
spectral plane corresponding to modulation or Benjamin-Fair instability.
Generalized KdV and its higher-order analogues are used as illustrating
examples.

independent of the current direction with respect to the Ge crystal axes. It
progressively vanishes, either using a negative gate voltage due to carrier
activation into the bulk (without spin-splitted bands), or by increasing the

be driven into a topological phase by increasing the Zeeman spin splitting
beyond a critical value. In the topological phase, the system exhibits the
hallmarks of chiral p-wave superfluidity, including exotic Majorana
excitations. Previous theoretical studies of this realization of a
twodimensional topological Fermi superfluid have focused on the BCS regime
where the s-wave Cooper pairs are only weakly bound and, hence, the induced
chiral p-wave order parameter has a small magnitude. Motivated by the goal to
identify potential new ways for the experimental realization of robust
topological superfluids in ultra-cold atom gases, we study the BCS-to-BEC
crossover driven by increasing the Cooper-pair binding energy for this system.
In particular, we obtain phase diagrams in the parameter space of two-particle
bound-state energy and Zeeman spin-splitting energy. Ordinary characteristics
of the BCS-to-BEC crossover, in particular the shrinking and eventual
disappearance of the Fermi surface, are observed in the nontopological phase.
In contrast, the topological phase retains all features of chiral p-wave
superfluidity, including a well-defined underlying Fermi surface, even for
large s-wave pair-binding energies. Compared to the BCS limit, the topological
superfluid in the BEC regime turns out to be better realizable even for only
moderate magnitude of spin-orbit coupling because the chiral p-wave order
parameter is generally larger and remnants of s-wave pairing are suppressed. We
identify optimal parameter ranges that can aid further experimental
investigations and elucidate the underlying physical reason for the persistence
of the chiral p-wave superfluid.

in an image described by a referring expression. It involves a joint
understanding of natural language and image content, and is essential for a
range of visual tasks related to human-computer interaction. As a
language-to-vision matching task, the core of this problem is to not only
extract all the necessary information (i.e., objects and the relationships
among them) in both the image and referring expression, but also make full use
of context information to align cross-modal semantic concepts in the extracted
information. Unfortunately, existing work on grounding referring expressions
fails to accurately extract multi-order relationships from the referring
expression and associate them with the objects and their related contexts in
the image. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Modal Relationship Extractor
(CMRE) to adaptively highlight objects and relationships (spatial and semantic
relations) related to the given expression with a cross-modal attention
mechanism, and represent the extracted information as a language-guided visual
relation graph. In addition, we propose a Gated Graph Convolutional Network
(GGCN) to compute multimodal semantic contexts by fusing information from
different modes and propagating multimodal information in the structured
relation graph. Experimental results on three common benchmark datasets show
that our Cross-Modal Relationship Inference Network, which consists of CMRE and
GGCN, significantly surpasses all existing state-of-the-art methods. Code is

better representation of bone anatomy. Unfortunately, CT imaging exposes
patients to potentially harmful sources of ionizing radiation. Image synthesis
methods present a solution for avoiding extra radiation exposure. In this
paper, we perform image synthesis to create a realistic, synthetic CT image
from MRI of the same subject, and we present a comparison of different image
synthesis techniques. Using a dataset of 30 paired MRI and CT image volumes,
our results compare image synthesis using deep neural network regression,
state-of-the-art adversarial deep learning, as well as atlas-based synthesis
utilizing image registration. We also present a novel synthesis method that
combines multi-atlas registration as a prior to deep learning algorithms, in
which we perform a weighted addition of synthetic CT images, derived from
atlases, to the output of a deep neural network to obtain a residual type of
learning. In addition to evaluating the quality of the synthetic CT images, we
also demonstrate that image synthesis methods allow for more accurate bone

Recently, these operations have been extended to unrooted phylogenetic
networks, which are generalisations of phylogenetic trees that can model
reticulated evolutionary relationships. Here, we study global and local
properties of spaces of phylogenetic networks under these three operations. In
particular, we prove connectedness and asymptotic bounds on the diameters of

level-k networks. We also examine the behaviour of shortest TBR-sequence
between two phylogenetic networks in a class, and whether the TBR-distance

the space of phylogenetic trees is an isometric subgraph of the space of
phylogenetic networks under TBR. Lastly, we show that computing the

Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests are performed to reexamine the consistency of

  Recommendation",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Session-based recommender systems have attracted much attention recently. To
capture the sequential dependencies, existing methods resort either to data
augmentation techniques or left-to-right style autoregressive training.Since
these methods are aimed to model the sequential nature of user behaviors, they
ignore the future data of a target interaction when constructing the prediction
model for it. However, we argue that the future interactions after a target
interaction, which are also available during training, provide valuable signal
on user preference and can be used to enhance the recommendation quality.
  Properly integrating future data into model training, however, is non-trivial
to achieve, since it disobeys machine learning principles and can easily cause
data leakage. To this end, we propose a new encoder-decoder framework named
Gap-filling based Recommender (GRec), which trains the encoder and decoder by a
gap-filling mechanism. Specifically, the encoder takes a partially-complete
session sequence (where some items are masked by purpose) as input, and the
decoder predicts these masked items conditioned on the encoded representation.
We instantiate the general GRec framework using convolutional neural network
with sparse kernels, giving consideration to both accuracy and efficiency. We
conduct experiments on two real-world datasets covering short-, medium-, and
long-range user sessions, showing that GRec significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods. More empirical studies
verify the high utility of modeling future contexts under our GRec framework.

parameter within the stability range at which the discriminant $D_4$ vanish,
consequently, Arnold-Moser theorem fails, which infer that triangular
equilibrium points are unstable in nonlinear sense within the stability range.
Present analysis is limited up to linear effect of the perturbations, which
will be helpful to study the more generalized problem.

supports both a continuous-time discrete-space limit, leading to lattice

Three different possible inputs (reference strings, reference segments and a

alternative scenarios to interpret the broad-band emission from blazars. At
present, only few TeV blazars have been observed as EHBL objects in the
extragalactic Universe. Due to their hard $\gamma$--ray spectra and long term
variability, the observations of EHBL type of blazars at different redshifts
help in probing the cosmic magnetic field and extragalactic background light in
the Universe. Such objects also provide astrophysical sites to explore the
particle acceleration mechanisms like magnetic reconnection and second order
Fermi acceleration. Therefore, it has become important to identify more objects
as EHBL using the observations available in the literature. Recent studies on
the blazar Mrk 501 indicate that this source may exhibit an EHBL behaviour. In
this paper, we use long term observations of Mrk 501 to explore its nature. Two

Hamiltonian of the system is very important to discuss the dynamics in the
vicinity of invariant objects. In general, it represents a nonlinear
approximation to the dynamics, which is very helpful to obtain the information
about realistic solution of the problem. Present paper reflects about
normalization of the Hamiltonian and analysis of nonlinear stability in
non-resonance case, in the Chermnykh-like problem under the influence of
perturbations in the form of radiation pressure, oblateness, and a disc. To
describe nonlinear stability, initially, quadratic part of the Hamiltonian is
normalized in the neighborhood of triangular equilibrium point and then higher
order normalization is performed. Due to the presence of perturbations and a
tedious huge algebraic computation for intermediate terms, we have computed
only up to the fourth order normalized Hamiltonian using Lie transforms. In
non-resonance case, nonlinear stability of the system is discussed with the
help of Arnold-Moser theorem. Again, the effects of radiation pressure,
oblateness and presence of the disc are analyzed, separately and it is observed
that in the absence as well as presence of perturbation parameters, triangular
equilibrium point is unstable in nonlinear sense within the stability range
$0<\mu<\mu_1=\bar{\mu_c}$ due to failure of Arnold-Moser theorem. However,
perturbation parameters affect the values of $\mu$ at which $D_4=0$,
significantly. This study may help to analyze more generalized cases of the
problem in the presence of some other types of perturbations such as P-R drag
and solar wind drag. The results are limited to the regular symmetric disc but
in future it can be extended.

the sentiment dependencies between different aspects in one sentence. We
evaluate the proposed approach on the SemEval 2014 datasets. Experiments show

fields as well as vorticity can be constructed by means of some different
relativistic or nonrelativistic approaches. To cover the noninertial features
of rotating frames one can start from the modified quantum kinetic equation of
Wigner function in Minkowski spacetime. It provides a relativistic chiral
transport equation whose nonrelativistic limit yields a consistent
three-dimensional kinetic theory which does not depend explicitly on spatial
coordinates. Recently a chiral transport equation in curved spacetime has been
proposed and its nonrelativistic limit in rotating coordinates was considered
in the absence of electromagnetic fields. We show that the modified theory can
be extended to curved spacetime. The related particle current density and
chiral transport equation for an inertial observer in the rotating frame are
derived. A novel three-dimensional chiral kinetic transport equation is
established by inspecting the nonrelativistic limit of the curved spacetime
approach in the rotating frame for a comoving observer in the presence of
electromagnetic fields. It explicitly depends on spatial coordinates. We prove
that it is consistent with the chiral anomaly, chiral magnetic and vortical
effects.

Scattering (DIS) and Diffractive DIS (DDIS) at high energies includes their
experimental investigation and thorough theoretical description. The
conventional instrument for theoretical investigation of DIS at large x is
DGLAP. It describes the Q^2-evolution. Description of DIS in the small-x region
requires accounting for the both Q^2 and x -evolution at the same time.
Combining DGLAP with total resummation of double logarithms of x and Q^2, we
present a description of structure function F_1 at large Q^2 and arbitrary x.
Making use of the necessity of the shift of Q^2 in order to regulate infrared
singularities, we obtain an expression for F_1 valid at arbitrary x and Q^2.
The obtained expressions coincide with the DLA expressions at small x and at
the same time coincides with the DGLAP result at large x and large Q^2.
Accounting for virtualities k^2 of the external partons allows us to obtain
expressions for F_1 in K_T-Factorization, which are valid at arbitrary Q^2 and
arbitrary relations between Q^2 and k^2. Expressions for F_1 in all types of
QCD factorization exhibit the small-x asymptotics of the Pomeron type. This
Pomeron is generated by the high-energy asymptotics of amplitudes of the 2 -> 2
parton-parton forward scattering. These amplitudes are calculated in DLA, so
their asymptotics have nothing to do with the BFKL Pomeron. We demonstrate that
the parton-parton amplitudes can be used in the DDIS models instead of BFKL
Pomeron or combinations of hard and soft Pomerons at non-asymptotic energies.
On the other hand, this modification automatically ensures the Pomerons
asymptotics, which simplifies and makes more consistent theory of DDIS.

redundancy in their filter weights. Various methods have been proposed in the
literature to compress trained CNNs. These include techniques like pruning
weights, filter quantization and representing filters in terms of a basis
functions. Our approach falls in this latter class of strategies, but is
distinct in that that we show both compressed learning and representation can
be achieved without significant modifications of popular CNN architectures.
Specifically, any convolution layer of the CNN is easily replaced by two
successive convolution layers: the first is a set of fixed filters (that
represent the knowledge space of the entire layer and do not change), which is
followed by a layer of one-dimensional filters (that represent the learned
knowledge in this space). For the pre-trained networks, the fixed layer is just
the truncated eigen-decompositions of the original filters. The 1D filters are
initialized as the weights of linear combination, but are fine-tuned to recover
any performance loss due to the truncation. For training networks from scratch,
we use a set of random orthogonal fixed filters (that never change), and learn
the 1D weight vector directly from the labeled data. Our method substantially
reduces i) the number of learnable parameters during training, and ii) the
number of multiplication operations and filter storage requirements during
implementation. It does so without requiring any special operators in the
convolution layer, and extends to all known popular CNN architectures. We apply
our method to four well known network architectures trained with three
different data sets. Results show a consistent reduction in i) the number of
operations by up to a factor of 5, and ii) number of learnable parameters by up
to a factor of 18, with less than 3% drop in performance on the CIFAR100

integrals over any type of orbitals (Slater, Sturmian, finite-range, numerical,

(orbital-independent) gaussian sampling of the two-electron configuration space
and on the use of efficient zero-variance Monte Carlo estimators. Quite
remarkably, it is shown that the high level of accuracy required on
two-electron integrals to make Hartree-Fock (HF) and configuration interaction
(CI) calculations feasible can be achieved. A first zero-variance estimator is
built by introducing a gaussian approximation of the orbitals and by evaluating
the two-electron integrals using a correlated sampling scheme for the
difference between exact and approximate orbitals. A second one is based on the
introduction of a general coordinate transformation. The price to pay for this
simple and general Monte Carlo scheme is the high computational cost required.
However, we argue that the great simplicity of the algorithm, its
embarrassingly parallel nature, its ideal adaptation to modern computational
platforms and, most importantly, the possibility of using more compact and
physically meaningful basis sets make nevertheless the method attractive. HF
and near full CI (FCI) calculations using Slater-type orbitals (STO) are

best of our knowledge, our largest FCI calculation involving 18 active
electrons distributed among 90 orbitals for the cyanine molecule, is the most
extensive molecular calculation performed so far using pure STO orbitals (no
gaussian approximation, even for the challenging four-center two-electron

for the companion star being heated during the disc-state. We observe a
spectral type change along the orbit, from G5 to F6 at the secondary star's
superior and inferior conjunction, respectively, and find that the
corresponding irradiating luminosity can be powered by the high energy
accretion luminosity or the spin-down luminosity of the neutron star. We
determine the secondary star's radial velocity semi-amplitude from the metallic
(primarily Fe and Ca) and Halpha absorption lines during these different
states. The metallic and Halpha radial velocity semi-amplitude determined from
the 2009 pulsar-state observations allows us to constrain the secondary star's
true radial velocity K_2=276.3+/-5.6 km/s and the binary mass ratio
q=0.137+/-0.003. By comparing the observed metallic and Halpha absorption-line
radial velocity semi-amplitudes with model predictions, we can explain the
observed semi-amplitude changes during the pulsar-state and during the
pulsar/disc-state transition as being due to different amounts of heating and
the presence of an accretion disc, respectively.

robots by designing and integrating a novel soft robotic system for ultrasound
imaging. It employs the inherent qualities of soft fluidic actuators to
establish safe, adaptable interaction between ultrasound probe and patient.
Methods: We acquire clinical data to determine the movement ranges and force
levels required in prenatal foetal ultrasound imaging and design the soft
robotic end-effector accordingly. We verify its mechanical characteristics,
derive and validate a kinetostatic model and demonstrate controllability and
imaging capabilities on an ultrasound phantom. Results: The soft robot exhibits
the desired stiffness characteristics and is able to reach 100% of the required
workspace when no external force is present, and 95% of the workspace when
considering its compliance. The model can accurately predict the end-effector
pose with a mean error of 1.18+/-0.29mm in position and 0.92+/-0.47deg in
orientation. The derived controller is, with an average position error of
0.39mm, able to track a target pose efficiently without and with externally
applied loads. Ultrasound images acquired with the system are of equally good
quality compared to a manual sonographer scan. Conclusion: The system is able
to withstand loads commonly applied during foetal ultrasound scans and remains
controllable with a motion range similar to manual scanning. Significance: The
proposed soft robot presents a safe, cost-effective solution to offloading
sonographers in day-to-day scanning routines. The design and modelling
paradigms are greatly generalizable and particularly suitable for designing
soft robots for physical interaction tasks.

The co-rotating component of the ultrastrong low-frequency modulation field
excites virtual multiple photon processes between the dressed states and forms
the Rabi frequency in the so-called rotating wave approximation (RWA). The
counter-rotating modulation component also gives a significant contribution to
the Rabi frequency owing to the Bloch--Siegert effect. It is shown that for
properly chosen parameters of the modulation field and qubit, the Rabi
oscillations in the RWA vanish due to destructive interference of multiple
photon processes. In this case the Rabi oscillation results exclusively from
the Bloch--Siegert effect and is directly observed in the time-resolved
coherent dynamics as the Bloch--Siegert oscillation. Correspondingly, in
Fourier spectra of the coherent response, triplets are transformed into
doublets with the splitting between the lines equal to twice the Bloch--Siegert
shift. We demonstrate these features by calculations of the qubit's evolution
in the conditions of experiments with a NV center in diamond, where Raman

standard Fourier analysis of $f$ relies on the study of functions
$g(\mathcal{L})f$ for some filters $g$ on $I_\mathcal{L}$, the smallest
interval containing the Laplacian spectrum ${\mathrm sp}(\mathcal{L}) \subset
I_\mathcal{L}$. We show that for carefully chosen partitions $I_\mathcal{L} =
\sqcup_{1\leq k\leq K} I_k$ ($I_k \subset I_\mathcal{L}$), there are many
advantages in understanding the collection $(g(\mathcal{L}_{I_k})f)_{1\leq
k\leq K}$ instead of $g(\mathcal{L})f$ directly, where $\mathcal{L}_I$ is the
projected matrix $P_I(\mathcal{L})\mathcal{L}$. First, the partition provides a
convenient modelling for the study of theoretical properties of Fourier
analysis and allows for new results in graph signal analysis (\emph{e.g.} noise
level estimation, Fourier support approximation). We extend the study of
spectral graph wavelets to wavelets localized in the Fourier domain, called
LocLets, and we show that well-known frames can be written in terms of LocLets.
From a practical perspective, we highlight the interest of the proposed
localized Fourier analysis through many experiments that show significant
improvements in two different tasks on large graphs, noise level estimation and
signal denoising. Moreover, efficient strategies permit to compute sequence
$(g(\mathcal{L}_{I_k})f)_{1\leq k\leq K}$ with the same time complexity as for

most probable taxa. This type of discriminant analysis employs reward functions
with a set-valued input argument, so that an optimal Bayes classifier can be

is in contrast to prior results, which are often tailored to
exponentially-tailed losses. For the exponential loss specifically, with $n$
training examples and $t$ gradient descent steps, our dual analysis further
allows us to prove an $O(\ln(n)/\ln(t))$ convergence rate to the $\ell_2$

in both $n$ and $t$, which has not been presented by prior work. On the other

$O(1/t)$ rates for both $\ell_2$ margin maximization and implicit bias, whereas
prior work (including all first-order methods for the general hard-margin

$O(1/t)$ margin rates to a suboptimal margin, with an implied (slower) bias

finite sample rates, and so far only the parametric rate has been obtained.
Assuming these identifiability conditions, together with a measure-smoothness
condition on the regression function and Tsybakov's margin condition, we show
that the Robust kNN classifier of Gao et al. attains, the minimax optimal rates
of the noise-free setting, up to a log factor, even when trained on data with
unknown asymmetric label noise. Hence, our results provide a solid theoretical
backing for this empirically successful algorithm. By contrast the standard kNN
is not even consistent in the setting of asymmetric label noise. A key idea in
our analysis is a simple kNN based method for estimating the maximum of a
function that requires far less assumptions than existing mode estimators do,
and which may be of independent interest for noise proportion estimation and
randomised optimisation problems.

identification. In contrast, the identification of stereotypes in single cells
poses a significant challenge as the cell lacks these landmark features, and
finding constraints on cell shape is a non-trivial task. Here, we use the
maximum caliber variational method to build a minimal model of cell behavior
during migration. Without reference to biochemical details, we are able to make
behavioral predictions over timescales of minutes using only changes in cell

  Effects",,,,,"cs.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many lighting methods used in computer graphics such as indirect illumination
can have very high computational costs and need to be approximated for
real-time applications. These costs can be reduced by means of upsampling
techniques which tend to introduce artifacts and affect the visual quality of
the rendered image. This paper suggests a versatile approach for accelerating
the rendering of screen space methods while maintaining the visual quality.
This is achieved by exploiting the low frequency nature of many of these
illumination methods and the geometrical continuity of the scene. First the
screen space is dynamically divided into separate sub-images, then the
illumination is rendered for each sub-image in an adequate resolution and
finally the sub-images are put together in order to compose the final image.
Therefore we identify edges in the scene and generate masks precisely
specifying which part of the image is included in which sub-image. The masks
therefore determine which part of the image is rendered in which resolution. A
step wise upsampling and merging process then allows optically soft transitions
between the different resolution levels. For this paper, the introduced
multi-resolution rendering method was implemented and tested on three commonly
used lighting methods. These are screen space ambient occlusion, soft shadow
mapping and screen space global illumination.

describes the (new) studies on citation content and context analyses as well as
the studies that explore the citation motivation of scholars through surveys or
interviews. One focus in this paper is on the technical developments in the
last decade, such as the richer meta-data available and machine-readable
formats of scientific papers. These developments have resulted in citation
context analyses of large datasets in comprehensive studies (which was not
possible previously). Many studies in recent years have used computational and
machine learning techniques to determine citation functions and polarities,
some of which have attempted to overcome the methodological weaknesses of
previous studies. The automated recognition of citation functions seems to have
the potential to greatly enhance citation indices and information retrieval
capabilities. Our review of the empirical studies demonstrates that a paper may
be cited for very different scientific and non-scientific reasons. This result
accords with the finding by Bornmann and Daniel (2008). The current review also
shows that to better understand the relationship between citing and cited
documents, a variety of features should be analyzed, primarily the citation
context, the semantics and linguistic patterns in citations, citation locations
within the citing document, and citation polarity (negative, neutral,
positive).

community distrust are undermining control efforts, including vaccination
strategies. In this paper, we employed an individual-level stochastic
structured transmission model to assess the impact of vaccination strategies on
epidemic control in the context of variable levels of household
inaccessibility. We found that a ring vaccination strategy of close contacts
would not be effective for containing the epidemic in the context of
significant delays to vaccinating contacts even for low levels of household
inaccessibility and evaluate the impact of a supplemental community vaccination
strategy. For lower levels of inaccessibility, the probability of epidemic
containment increases over time. For higher levels of inaccessibility, even the
combined ring and community vaccination strategies are not expected to contain
the epidemic even though they help lower incidence levels, which saves lives,
makes the epidemic easier to contain and reduces spread to other communities.
We found that ring vaccination is effective for containing an outbreak until
the levels of inaccessibility exceeds approximately 10%, a combined ring and
community vaccination strategy is effective until the levels of inaccessibility
exceeds approximately 50%. Our findings underscore the need to enhance
community engagement to public health interventions.

consistency more accurately. First, for the robustness to noise and sparse
errors in data and atoms, RFDDL aims at recovering the underlying clean data
and clean atom subspaces jointly, and then performs DL and encodes the locality
in the recovered subspaces. Second, to enable the data sampled from a nonlinear
manifold to be handled potentially and obtain the accurate reconstruction by
avoiding the overfitting, RFDDL minimizes the reconstruction error in a
flexible manner. Third, to encode the label consistency accurately, RFDDL
involves a discriminative flexible sparse code error to encourage the
coefficients to be soft. Fourth, to encode the locality well, RFDDL defines the
Laplacian matrix over recovered atoms, includes label information of atoms in
terms of intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, and associates
with group sparse codes and classifier to obtain the accurate discriminative
locality-constrained coefficients and classifier. Extensive results on public

When the sample is generated from a simulation model and we have control over

Monte Carlo yields, under certain conditions, a random conditional density
which is an unbiased estimator of the true density at any point. By averaging
independent replications, we obtain a density estimator that converges at a
faster rate than the usual ones. Moreover, combining this new type of estimator
with randomized quasi-Monte Carlo to generate the samples typically brings a
larger improvement on the error and convergence rate than for the usual
estimators, because the new estimator is smoother as a function of the

that encodes input streams from the external environment to its state and
processes them through state transitions. The information processing capacity
(IPC) is an excellent tool that comprehensively evaluates these processed
inputs, providing details of unknown information processing in black box
systems; however, this measure can be applied to only time-invariant systems.
This paper extends the applicable range to time-variant systems and further
reveals that the IPC is equivalent to coefficients of polynomial chaos (PC)
expansion in more general dynamical systems. To achieve this objective, we
tackle three issues. First, we establish a connection between the IPC for
time-invariant systems and PC expansion, which is a type of polynomial
expansion using orthogonal functions of input history as bases. We prove that
the IPC corresponds to the squared norm of the coefficient vector of the basis
in the PC expansion. Second, we show that an input following an arbitrary
distribution can be used for the IPC, removing previous restrictions to
specific input distributions. Third, we extend the conventional orthogonal
bases to functions of both time and input history and propose the IPC for
time-variant systems. To show the significance of our approach, we demonstrate
that our measure can reveal information representations in not only machine
learning networks but also a real, cultured neural network. Our generalized
measure paves the way for unveiling the information processing capabilities of
a wide variety of physical dynamics which has been left behind in nature.

transmitters in the mm-wave band must employ highly directional antenna arrays

Therefore, to address the limited support problem we propose to train GANs by
using different filtered versions of the real and generated data distributions.
In this way, filtering does not prevent the exact matching of the data

distributions. As filtering we consider adding samples from an arbitrary
distribution to the data, which corresponds to a convolution of the data
distribution with the arbitrary one. We also propose to learn the generation of
these samples so as to challenge the discriminator in the adversarial training.

that, similarly to ethanol-water mixtures, the occurrence of 5-membered

on the alcohol-alcohol HB energy distribution function. HB lifetimes have been
found significantly longer in the mixtures than they are in the pure liquids.

resistance. Because the lattice site occupied by a point defect has a much
smaller size than phonon wavelengths, the scattering of thermal acoustic
phonons by point defects in solids has been widely assumed to be the Rayleigh
scattering type. In contrast to this conventional perception, using an ab
initio Green's function approach, we show that the scattering by point defects
in PbTe and GeTe exhibits Mie scattering characterized by a weaker frequency
dependence of the scattering rates and highly asymmetric scattering phase
functions. These unusual behaviors occur because the strain field induced by a
point defect can extend for a long distance much larger than the lattice
spacing. Because of the asymmetric scattering phase functions, the widely used
relaxation time approximation fails with an error of ~20% at 300K in predicting
lattice thermal conductivity when the vacancy fraction is 1%. Our results show
that the phonon scattering by point defects in IV-VI semiconductors cannot be
described by the simple kinetic theory combined with Rayleigh scattering.

efforts to realize this state have focussed mainly on Helium, where
supersolidity remains elusive. Recently, supersolidity has also been studied
intensively in ultracold quantum gases, and some of its defining properties
have been induced in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and
BECs coupled to two crossed optical cavities. However, the periodicity of the

with every other is often challenging due to multiple scales and high contrast.
One needs some types of model reduction. One of the approaches is
multi-continuum technique, where every process in each continuum is modeled
separately and an interaction term is added. Direct numerical simulation in
multi scale media is usually not practicable. For this reason, one constructs
the corresponding homogenized equations. The paper develops a hierarchical
approach for solving cell problems at a dense network of macroscopic points
with an essentially optimal computation cost. The method employs the fact that
neighboring representative volume elements (RVEs) share similar features; and
effective properties of the neighboring RVEs are close to each other. The
hierarchical approach reduces computation cost by using different levels of
resolution for cell problems at different macroscopic points. The method
requires a hierarchy of macroscopic grid points and a corresponding nested
approximation spaces with different levels of resolution. Each level of
macroscopic points is assigned to an approximation finite element (FE) space
which is used to solve the cell problems at the macroscopic points in that
level. We prove rigorously that this hierarchical method achieves the same
level of accuracy as that of the full solve where cell problems at every
macroscopic point are solved using the FE spaces with the highest level of
resolution, but at the essentially optimal computation cost. Numerical
implementation that computes effective permeabilities of a two scale

external control of the amount of shear and growth regulates the spatial extent

another BBM embedding of the same attractor so that the two induced prime ends

train these algorithms may contain features that are often incomprehensible to
an end-user even with the best XAI algorithms. Thus, the problem of
explainability has to be addressed starting right from the data creation step.
In this paper, we studied this problem considering the use-case of explaining
loan denials to end-users as opposed to AI engineers or domain experts.
Motivated by the lack of datasets that are representative of user-friendly
explanations, we build the first-of-its-kind dataset that is representative of
user-friendly explanations for loan denials. The paper shares some of the
insights gained in curating the dataset. First, existing datasets seldom
contain features that end users consider as acceptable in understanding a
model's decision. Second, understanding of the explanation's context such as
the human-in-the-loop seeking the explanation, and the purpose for which an
explanation is sought, aids in the creation of user-friendly datasets. Thus,
our dataset, which we call Xnet, also contains explanations that serve
different purposes: those that educate the loan applicants, and help them take
appropriate action towards a future approval. We hope this work will trigger
the creation of new user friendly datasets, and serve as a guide for the
curation of such datasets.

non-polyhedral, the asymptotic superlinear convergence of our proposed method
PPDNA can be obtained by leveraging on the local Lipschitz continuity of the

the PPDNA for solving the group graphical Lasso model can be highly efficient
and robust.

promising new approach for certifying improved rates of convergence by means of
higher-order SOS certificates. To determine analytical rate bounds, in this
work we use the first level of the SOS hierarchy and derive new result{s} for
noisy gradient descent with inexact line search methods (Armijo, Wolfe, and

but squeezes feature maps along different slices of a tensor separately to
retain more spatial information that is subsequently used in the excitation
step. We demonstrate that PE modules can be easily integrated in 3D U-Net,
boosting performance by 5% Dice points, while only increasing the model
complexity by 2%. We evaluate the PE module on two challenging tasks,
whole-brain segmentation of MRI scans and whole-body segmentation of CT scans.

convolutional neural networks trained on fully annotated datasets, that have
been shown to be notoriously expensive to collect, both in terms of time and
money. To remedy this situation, weakly supervised methods leverage other forms
of supervision that require substantially less annotation effort, but they
typically present an inability to predict precise object boundaries due to
approximate nature of the supervisory signals in those regions. While great
progress has been made in improving the performance, many of these weakly
supervised methods are highly tailored to their own specific settings. This
raises challenges in reusing algorithms and making steady progress. In this
paper, we intentionally avoid such practices when tackling weakly supervised
semantic segmentation. In particular, we train standard neural networks with
partial cross-entropy loss function for the labeled pixels and our proposed
Gated CRF loss for the unlabeled pixels. The Gated CRF loss is designed to
deliver several important assets: 1) it enables flexibility in the kernel
construction to mask out influence from undesired pixel positions; 2) it
offloads learning contextual relations to CNN and concentrates on semantic
boundaries; 3) it does not rely on high-dimensional filtering and thus has a
simple implementation. Throughout the paper we present the advantages of the
loss function, analyze several aspects of weakly supervised training, and show
that our `purist' approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for both
click-based and scribble-based annotations.

decision-making reveal how individuals should tolerate risk in different
environments. To optimise wealth over time, agents should adapt their utility
function according to the dynamical setting they face. Linear utility is
optimal for additive dynamics, whereas logarithmic utility is optimal for
multiplicative dynamics. Whether humans approximate time optimal behavior
across different dynamics is unknown. Here we compare the effects of additive
versus multiplicative gamble dynamics on risky choice. We show that utility
functions are modulated by gamble dynamics in ways not explained by prevailing
decision theory. Instead, as predicted by time optimality, risk aversion
increases under multiplicative dynamics, distributing close to the values that
maximise the time average growth of wealth. We suggest that our findings
motivate a need for explicitly grounding theories of decision-making on ergodic

phase-field description for fractures in brittle materials. Our approach is
based on an a posteriori error estimator for the phase-field variational
inequality realizing the fracture irreversibility constraint. The key goal is
the development of a reliable and efficient residual-type error estimator for
the phase-field fracture model in each time-step. Based on this error
estimator, error indicators for local mesh adaptivity are extracted. The
proposed estimator is based on a technique known for singularly perturbed
equations in combination with estimators for variational inequalities. These
theoretical developments are used to formulate an adaptive mesh refinement
algorithm. For the numerical solution, the fracture irreversibility is imposed
using a Lagrange multiplier. The resulting saddle-point system has three
unknowns: displacements, phase-field, and a Lagrange multiplier for the crack
irreversibility. Several numerical experiments demonstrate our theoretical
findings with the newly developed estimators and the corresponding refinement
strategy.

stable rank (a softer version of the rank operator). This leads to an
interesting question of whether controlling these quantities might improve the
generalization behaviour of NNs. To this end, we propose stable rank
normalization (SRN), a novel, optimal, and computationally efficient
weight-normalization scheme which minimizes the stable rank of a linear

can be shown to have a unique optimal solution. Moreover, we show that SRN
allows control of the data-dependent empirical Lipschitz constant, which in
contrast to the Lipschitz upper-bound, reflects the true behaviour of a model
on a given dataset. We provide thorough analyses to show that SRN, when applied
to the linear layers of a NN for classification, provides striking
improvements-11.3% on the generalization gap compared to the standard NN along
with significant reduction in memorization. When applied to the discriminator
of GANs (called SRN-GAN) it improves Inception, FID, and Neural divergence
scores on the CIFAR 10/100 and CelebA datasets, while learning mappings with
low empirical Lipschitz constants.

suggest that only one-atom-thick crystals could be used as proton conducting

proton permeation to 5 A-wide tubular channels that perforate micas' crystal

bi-level optimisation problem is formulated and solved to estimate OD flows
from pre-existent demand matrix and historical traffic flow counts. The
estimated demand is then considered as an input for a time series OD demand
prediction model to support the DTA model for short-term traffic condition
forecasting. Results show a high capability of the proposed OD demand
estimation method to reduce the DTA model error through an iterative solution
algorithm. Moreover, the applicability of the OD demand prediction approach is
investigated for an incident analysis application for a major corridor in

fracture is treated by employing a discrete field approach within the material
point method setting. In this, the equations of motion and phase field
governing equations are solved independently for each discrete field using a
predictor-corrector algorithm. Contact at the interface is resolved through
frictional contact conditions. The proposed method is verified using analytical

spaces; in particular, we classify indecomposable structures of this kind. The
classification depends on the ground field, which we only assume to be perfect
and not of characteristic 2. Our work uses the theory of representations of
partially ordered sets with (order reversing) involution; for (co)isotropic
triples, the relevant poset is ""$2 + 2 + 2$"" consisting of three independent
ordered pairs, with the involution exchanging the members of each pair. A key
feature of the classification is that any indecomposable (co)isotropic triple
is either ""split"" or ""non-split"". The latter is the case when the poset
representation underlying an indecomposable (co)isotropic triple is itself
indecomposable. Otherwise, in the ""split"" case, the underlying representation
is decomposable and necessarily the direct sum of a dual pair of indecomposable
poset representations; the (co)isotropic triple is a ""symplectification"". In
the course of the paper we develop the framework of ""symplectic poset
representations"", which can be applied to a range of problems of symplectic
linear algebra. The classification of linear Hamiltonian vector fields, up to
conjugation, is an example; we briefly explain the connection between these and
(co)isotropic triples. The framework lends itself equally well to studying
poset representations on spaces carrying a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear
form; we mainly keep our focus, however, on the symplectic side.

related to the parton shower via the SoftDrop shared momentum fraction, the
groomed jet radius, and the jet Mass in p+p collisions at 200 GeV as a function
of jet transverse momenta. We also showcase the first measurement of iterative
softdrop groomed observables for first, second and third splits with an
initiator prong transverse momenta ranging from 20-25 GeV. In comparing the
un-corrected data to our simulation, we are able to look at snapshots of the
jet clustering history leading towards an understand of the time evolution of
the parton shower. Having established the p+p baseline, we present the first
measurement of the jet's inherent angular structure in Au+Au collisions at 200
GeV via an experimentally robust observable the opening angle between the two
leading sub-jets ($\theta_{SJ}$). In Au+Au collisions at STAR, we utilize a
specific di-jet selection as introduced in our previous momentum imbalance
($A_{J}$) measurement and measure both the $A_{J}$ and the recoil jet spectra
differentially as a function of the angular classes based on the $\theta_{SJ}$
observable. With such measurements, we probe the medium response to jets at a
particular resolution scale and find no significant differences in quenching
for jets of different angular scales as given by $\theta_{SJ}$.

a challenge problem, the standard approach to address this issue is to learn
the domain model firstly and then based on the learned model to find the (near)
optimal policy. However, offline learning the model often needs to store the
entire training data and cannot utilize the data generated in the planning
phase. Furthermore, current research usually assumes the learned model is
accurate or presupposes knowledge of the nature of the unobservable part of the

Predictive State Representations~(PSRs), a model-based planning approach is
proposed where the learning and planning phases can both be executed online and
no prior knowledge of the underlying system is required. Experimental results
show compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, our algorithm achieved a high

also serve as an energy storage system. In this setting, optimal scheduling of
an HVAC system is challenging because of the nonlinear and non-convex
characteristics of the PCM, which makes solving the corresponding optimization
problem using conventional optimization techniques impractical. Instead, we use
dynamic programming (DP) to deal with the nonlinear nature of the PCM. To
overcome DP's curse of dimensionality, this paper proposes a novel methodology
to reduce the computational burden, while maintaining the quality of the
solution. Specifically, the method incorporates approaches from sequential
decision making in artificial intelligence, including macro actions and
multi-time scale Markov decision processes, coupled with an underlying
state-space approximation to reduce the state-space and action-space size. The
performance of the method is demonstrated on an energy management problem for a
typical residential building located in Sydney, Australia. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method performs well with a computational
speed-up of up to 12,900 times compared to the direct application of DP.

new multi-scale dilated network for MRI reconstruction with high speed and

expand receptive fields of kernels to obtain almost same information. To

the objective function to minimize as the total travel time in the network.
Firstly, we develop the GA algorithm on a signalized testbed network under

parameter in the search space, manually tuning of DNN hyperparameters is
impractical. Automatic joint DNN and hardware hyperparameter optimization is
indispensable for such problems. Bayesian optimization-based approaches have
shown promising results for hyperparameter optimization of DNNs. However, most
of these techniques have been developed without considering the underlying
hardware, thereby leading to inefficient designs. Further, the few works that
perform joint optimization are not generalizable and mainly focus on CMOS-based
architectures. In this work, we present a novel pseudo agent-based
multi-objective hyperparameter optimization (PABO) for maximizing the DNN
performance while obtaining low hardware cost. Compared to the existing

optimization of accuracy and hardware cost and focuses on memristive

connections between the posterior Gaussian distribution models of network
accuracy and hardware cost requirements. The agent reduces the mathematical
complexity of the co-optimization problem by removing unnecessary computations

  Hardware Support",,,,,"cs.DC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The deep neural networks (DNNs) have been enormously successful in tasks that
were hitherto in the human-only realm such as image recognition, and language
translation. Owing to their success the DNNs are being explored for use in ever
more sophisticated tasks. One of the ways that the DNNs are made to scale for
the complex undertakings is by increasing their size -- deeper and wider
networks can model well the additional complexity. Such large models are
trained using model parallelism on multiple compute devices such as multi-GPUs
and multi-node systems.
  In this paper, we develop a compiler-driven approach to achieve model
parallelism. We model the computation and communication costs of a dataflow
graph that embodies the neural network training process and then, partition the
graph using heuristics in such a manner that the communication between compute
devices is minimal and we have a good load balance. The hardware scheduling
assistants are proposed to assist the compiler in fine tuning the distribution
of work at runtime.

serializing complex C++ objects common to reconstruction, analysis workflows
typically have simpler objects and can sustain higher event rates. To meet
these workflows, we have developed a ""bulk I/O"" interface, allowing multiple
events data to be returned per library call. This reduces ROOT-related
overheads and increases event rates - orders-of-magnitude improvements are
shown in microbenchmarks. Unfortunately, this bulk interface is difficult to
use as it requires users to identify when it is applicable and they still
""think"" in terms of events, not arrays of data. We have integrated the bulk I/O
interface into the new RDataFrame analysis framework inside ROOT. As
RDataFrame's interface can provide improved type information, the framework
itself can determine what data is readable via the bulk IO and automatically
switch between interfaces. We demonstrate how this can improve event rates when
reading analysis data formats, such as CMS's NanoAOD.

effective viscosity decreases as the wall deformability increases. This
shear-thinning behavior originates from the interactions between rigid
particles, soft wall and carrier fluid; an asymmetric wall deformation induces
a net lift force acting on the particles which therefore migrate towards the

suspension viscosity which can be used to model the rheology of suspensions

introduce a novel, simple and robust algorithm that leverages the high-quality
semantic segmentation to achieve a text-line extraction performance of 99.42%

retraining afterwards to recover from the accuracy loss caused by the use of
approximate operations. However, retraining of complex DNNs does not scale
well. In this paper, we demonstrate that efficient approximations can be
introduced into the computational path of DNN accelerators while retraining can
completely be avoided. ALWANN provides highly optimized implementations of DNNs
for custom low-power accelerators in which the number of computing units is
lower than the number of DNN layers. First, a fully trained DNN is converted to
operate with 8-bit weights and 8-bit multipliers in convolutional layers. A
suitable approximate multiplier is then selected for each computing element
from a library of approximate multipliers in such a way that (i) one
approximate multiplier serves several layers, and (ii) the overall
classification error and energy consumption are minimized. The optimizations
including the multiplier selection problem are solved by means of a
multiobjective optimization NSGA-II algorithm. In order to completely avoid the
computationally expensive retraining of DNN, which is usually employed to
improve the classification accuracy, we propose a simple weight updating scheme
that compensates the inaccuracy introduced by employing approximate
multipliers. The proposed approach is evaluated for two architectures of DNN
accelerators with approximate multipliers from the open-source ""EvoApprox""
library. We report that the proposed approach saves 30% of energy needed for
multiplication in convolutional layers of ResNet-50 while the accuracy is
degraded by only 0.6%. The proposed technique and approximate layers are

the amount of input data an ESN can store, is analyzed for a new type of deep
ESNs. In particular, two deep ESN architectures are studied. First, a parallel
deep ESN is proposed in which multiple reservoirs are connected in parallel
allowing them to average outputs of multiple ESNs, thus decreasing the
prediction error. Then, a series architecture ESN is proposed in which ESN
reservoirs are placed in cascade that the output of each ESN is the input of
the next ESN in the series. This series ESN architecture can capture more
features between the input sequence and the output sequence thus improving the
overall prediction accuracy. Fundamental analysis shows that the memory
capacity of parallel ESNs is equivalent to that of a traditional shallow ESN,
while the memory capacity of series ESNs is smaller than that of a traditional
shallow ESN.In terms of normalized root mean square error, simulation results
show that the parallel deep ESN achieves 38.5% reduction compared to the
traditional shallow ESN while the series deep ESN achieves 16.8% reduction.

However, computing the objective function of CNP is a frequent procedure and is
time-consuming (with complexity O(|V | + |E|)) during the search, which is a
