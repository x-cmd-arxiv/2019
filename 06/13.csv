or cell structure that best suits the given task. Recently, this approach has
shown promising performance improvements (on language modeling and image
classification) with reasonable training speed, using a weight sharing strategy
called Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS). In our work, we first
introduce a novel continual architecture search (CAS) approach, so as to
continually evolve the model parameters during the sequential training of
several tasks, without losing performance on previously learned tasks (via
block-sparsity and orthogonality constraints), thus enabling life-long
learning. Next, we explore a multi-task architecture search (MAS) approach over
ENAS for finding a unified, single cell structure that performs well across
multiple tasks (via joint controller rewards), and hence allows more
generalizable transfer of the cell structure knowledge to an unseen new task.
We empirically show the effectiveness of our sequential continual learning and
parallel multi-task learning based architecture search approaches on diverse
sentence-pair classification tasks (GLUE) and multimodal-generation based video
captioning tasks. Further, we present several ablations and analyses on the
learned cell structures.

field of their home galaxies and venture into intergalactic space. The most
extreme examples known have estimated speeds in excess of 1000 km/s. These can
be easily induced at the centres of galaxies via close encounters between
binary stars and supermassive black holes; however, a number of other
mechanisms operating elsewhere can produce them as well.
  Aims. Recent studies suggest that hypervelocity stars are ubiquitous in the
local Universe. In the Milky Way, the known hypervelocity stars are
anisotropically distributed, but it is unclear why. Here, we used Gaia Data
Release 2 (DR2) data to perform a systematic exploration aimed at confirming or
refuting these findings.
  Methods. We assume that the farther the candidate hypervelocity stars are,
the more likely they are to be unbound from the Galaxy. We used the statistical
analysis of both the spatial distribution and kinematics of these objects to
achieve our goals.
  Results. Focussing on nominal Galactocentric distances greater than 30 kpc,
which are the most distant candidates, we isolated a sample with speeds in
excess of 500 km/s that exhibits a certain degree of anisotropy but remains
compatible with possible systematic effects. We find that the effect of the
Eddington-Trumpler-Weaver bias is important in our case: over 80% of our
sources are probably located further away than implied by their parallaxes;
therefore, most of our velocity estimates are lower limits. If this bias is as
strong as suggested here, the contamination by disc stars may not affect our
overall conclusions.
  Conclusions. The subsample with the lowest uncertainties shows stronger, but
obviously systematic, anisotropies and includes a number of candidates of
possible extragalactic origin and young age with speeds of up to 2000 km/s.

conventional moment independence assumption towards full statistical
independence between instrument and error term. This allows us to prove
identification results and develop estimators for a structural function of
interest when the instrument is discrete, and in particular binary. When the
regressor of interest is also discrete with more mass points than the
instrument, we state straightforward conditions under which the structural
function is partially identified, and give modified assumptions which imply
point identification. These stronger assumptions are shown to hold outside of a
small set of conditional moments of the error term. Estimators for the
identified set are given when the structural function is either partially or
point identified. When the regressor is continuously distributed, we prove that
if the instrument induces a sufficiently rich variation in the joint
distribution of the regressor and error term then point identification of the
structural function is still possible. This approach is relatively tractable,
and under some standard conditions we demonstrate that our point identifying
assumption holds on a topologically generic set of density functions for the
joint distribution of regressor, error, and instrument. Our method also applies
to a well-known nonparametric quantile regression framework, and we are able to
state analogous point identification results in that context.

showing that the minimum spectral gap of the adiabatic Hamiltonian is at least

apply this technique to FeN$_4$ centers in graphene and show that the inclusion
of these terms has dramatic effects: as the iron orbitals become single
occupied due to the Coulomb repulsion, the inter-orbital interaction further
reduces the occupation yielding a non-monotonic behavior of the magnetic moment
as a function of the interactions, with maximum polarization only in a small
window at intermediate values of the parameters. Furthermore, $U'$ changes the

play an important role in dictating the robustness of the network towards

which when removed would lead to a large change in the underlying community
structure of the network. This problem is extremely important because the
community structure of a network allows deep underlying insights into how
function of a network and its topology affect each other. Moreover, it even
provides a way to condense large graphs into smaller graphs where each
community acts as a meta node and hence aids in easier network analysis. If
this community structure was to be compromised by either accidental or
intentional perturbations to the network, that would make such analysis
difficult. Since the problem of identifying such vital nodes is computationally
intractable, we propose some heuristics that allow us to find solutions close
to the optimal solution. To certify the effectiveness of our approach, we first
test these heuristics on small networks, and then move to larger networks to
show that we achieve similar results. The results reveal that the proposed
approaches are effective to analyze the vulnerability of communities in graphs

show that the proposed algorithm is scalable and can be applied to the

models have been widely used to solve the traffic classification task. However,
training such models requires a large amount of labeled data. Labeling data is
often the most difficult and time-consuming process in building a classifier.
To solve this challenge, we reformulate the traffic classification into a
multi-task learning framework where bandwidth requirement and duration of a
flow are predicted along with the traffic class. The motivation of this
approach is twofold: First, bandwidth requirement and duration are useful in
many applications, including routing, resource allocation, and QoS
provisioning. Second, these two values can be obtained from each flow easily
without the need for human labeling or capturing flows in a controlled and
isolated environment. We show that with a large amount of easily obtainable
data samples for bandwidth and duration prediction tasks, and only a few data
samples for the traffic classification task, one can achieve high accuracy. We
conduct two experiment with ISCX and QUIC public datasets and show the efficacy
of our approach.

uncertainties, degeneracies between model parameters, and empirical data of
low-mass stars. We constrain TRAPPIST-1's mass to $m_{\star} = 0.089
\pm{0.001}$ M$_{\odot}$ and find that its early XUV luminosity likely saturated
at $\log_{10}(L_{XUV}/L_{bol}) = -3.03^{+0.23}_{-0.12}$. From the posterior
distribution, we infer that there is a ${\sim}40\%$ chance that TRAPPIST-1 is
still in the saturated phase today, suggesting that TRAPPIST-1 has maintained
high activity and $L_{XUV}/L_{bol} \approx 10^{-3}$ for several Gyrs.
TRAPPIST-1's planetary system therefore likely experienced a persistent and
extreme XUV flux environment, potentially driving significant atmospheric
erosion and volatile loss. The inner planets likely received XUV fluxes
${\sim}10^3 - 10^4\times$ that of the modern Earth during TRAPPIST-1's

between two broad classes of algorithms: planning and reinforcement learning.
Planning algorithms effectively reason over long horizons, but assume access to
a local policy and distance metric over collision-free paths. Reinforcement
learning excels at learning policies and the relative values of states, but
fails to plan over long horizons. Despite the successes of each method in
various domains, tasks that require reasoning over long horizons with limited
feedback and high-dimensional observations remain exceedingly challenging for
both planning and reinforcement learning algorithms. Frustratingly, these sorts
of tasks are potentially the most useful, as they are simple to design (a human
only need to provide an example goal state) and avoid reward shaping, which can
bias the agent towards finding a sub-optimal solution. We introduce a general
control algorithm that combines the strengths of planning and reinforcement
learning to effectively solve these tasks. Our aim is to decompose the task of
reaching a distant goal state into a sequence of easier tasks, each of which
corresponds to reaching a subgoal. Planning algorithms can automatically find
these waypoints, but only if provided with suitable abstractions of the
environment -- namely, a graph consisting of nodes and edges. Our main insight
is that this graph can be constructed via reinforcement learning, where a
goal-conditioned value function provides edge weights, and nodes are taken to
be previously seen observations in a replay buffer. Using graph search over our
replay buffer, we can automatically generate this sequence of subgoals, even in
image-based environments. Our algorithm, search on the replay buffer (SoRB),
enables agents to solve sparse reward tasks over one hundred steps, and
generalizes substantially better than standard RL algorithms.

feedback and it then generalized using a two-fluid approach, the fate of the
nonaxisymmetric SGI, in either case, is an unexplored problem. We present a
linear perturbation analysis of the nonaxisymmetric SGI in a PPD by
implementing a two-fluid model. We explore the growth of the local,
nonaxisymmetric perturbations using a set of linearized perturbation equations
in a sheared frame. The nonaxisymmetric perturbations display significant
growth during a finite time interval even when the system is stable against the
axisymmetric perturbations. Furthermore, the surface density perturbations do
not show continuous growth but are temporally amplified. We also study cases
where the dust component undergoes amplification whereas the gas component
remains stable. The amplitude amplification, however, strongly depends on the
model parameters. In the minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN), for instance, the
dust fluid amplification at the radial distance 100 au occurs when the Stokes
number is about unity. But the amplification factor reduces as the dust and gas
coupling becomes weaker. Furthermore, perturbations with a larger azimuthal
wavelength exhibit a larger amplification factor.

phenomenon which can occur either at the genome or at the DNA level. A tandem
duplication takes a copy of a genome segment and inserts it right after the
segment - this can be represented as the string operation $AXB \Rightarrow
AXXB$. For example, Tandem exon duplications have been found in many species
such as human, fly or worm, and have been largely studied in computational
biology. The Tandem Duplication (TD) distance problem we investigate in this
paper is defined as follows: given two strings $S$ and $T$ over the same
alphabet, compute the smallest sequence of tandem duplications required to
convert $S$ to $T$. The natural question of whether the TD distance can be
computed in polynomial time was posed in 2004 by Leupold et al. and had
remained open, despite the fact that tandem duplications have received much
attention ever since. In this paper, we prove that this problem is NP-hard. We
further show that this hardness holds even if all characters of $S$ are
distinct. This is known as the exemplar TD distance, which is of special
relevance in bioinformatics. One of the tools we develop for the reduction is a
new problem called the Cost-Effective Subgraph, for which we obtain

that computing the exemplar TD distance between $S$ and $T$ is fixed-parameter

they could potentially increase their production baskets not only by a path

over-parameterized learning algorithms that (nearly) perfectly fit the training

labels of the training data is not explained by existing theoretical analyses.
Memorization of the training data also presents significant privacy risks when
the training data contains sensitive personal information and thus it is
important to understand whether such memorization is necessary for accurate
learning.
  We provide the first conceptual explanation and a theoretical model for this
phenomenon. Specifically, we demonstrate that for natural data distributions
memorization of labels is necessary for achieving close-to-optimal
generalization error. Crucially, even labels of outliers and noisy labels need
to be memorized. The model is motivated and supported by the results of several
recent empirical works. In our model, data is sampled from a mixture of
subpopulations and our results show that memorization is necessary whenever the
distribution of subpopulation frequencies is long-tailed. Image and text data
is known to be long-tailed and therefore our results establish a formal link

limiting memorization in learning and explain the disparate effects that

demonstrate that agents that directly optimize the SMM objective explore faster

travels towards us, it is deflected by massive objects that lie on its path.
When the mass density of the deflecting object exceeds a certain threshold,
multiple, highly distorted images of the source are observed. This strong
gravitational lensing effect has so far been treated as a model-fitting
problem. Using the observed multiple images as constraints yields a
self-consistent model of the deflecting mass density and the source object. As
several models meet the constraints equally well, we develop a lens
characterisation that separates data-based information from model assumptions.
The observed multiple images allow us to determine local properties of the
deflecting mass distribution on any mass scale from one simple set of
equations. Their solution is unique and free of model-dependent degeneracies.
The reconstruction of source objects can be performed completely

leads to significant uncertainties in their estimation, in particular limiting
the power of gravitational waves to place tight constraints on the nuclear
equation of state. Thus detailed studies of highly spinning neutron star
mergers are essential to understand all aspects of multimessenger observation
of such events. We perform a systematic investigation of the impact of neutron
star spin---considering dimensionless spin values up to $a_{\rm NS}=0.33$---on
the merger of equal mass, quasicircular binary neutron stars using fully

linked to the physics of the pseudogap Anderson model. While our

approximate local quantum criticality, which is continuously connected to and
responsible for the apparent quantum critical scaling above the classical

expected subtle differences in their nucleosynthetic origins, here we probe the
higher level of granularity encoded in the inter-family [Mg/Si] abundance
ratio. Using a large sample of stars with APOGEE abundance measurements, we
first demonstrate that there is additional information in this ratio beyond
what is already apparent in [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H] alone. We then consider
Gaia astrometry and stellar age estimates to empirically characterize the
relationships between [Mg/Si] and various stellar properties. We find small but
significant trends between this ratio and $\alpha$-enhancement, age, [Fe/H],
location in the Galaxy, and orbital actions. To connect these observed [Mg/Si]
variations to a physical origin, we attempt to predict the Mg and Si abundances

unable to reproduce abundances for the stars that we fit, which highlights
tensions between the yield tables, the chemical evolution model, and the data.

ex-situ stellar mass fraction in ETGs as a function of M and galactocentric

forefront, the theoretical study of DNNs has recently made important
advancements in analyzing the highly over-parameterized regime where some exact

supervised deep learning, involving renormalization group, Feynman diagrams and

predictions of learning curves of truly deep DNNs trained on polynomial
regression tasks and that these predictions can be used for efficient
hyper-parameter optimization. In addition, they explain how DNNs generalize
well despite being highly over-parameterized, this due to an entropic bias to
simple functions which, for the case of fully-connected DNNs with data sampled
on the hypersphere, are low order polynomials in the input vector. Being a
complex interacting system of artificial neurons, we believe that such tools

in massive stars with convective cores, and if this capacity depends on the
evolutionary stage of the models along the main sequence. Methods: We compute
1D stellar structure and evolution models for four different prescriptions of
the mixing and temperature gradient in the near-core region. Their effect on
the frequencies of dipole prograde gravity modes in both Slowly Pulsating B and
$\beta$ Cep stars is investigated, as well as for pressure modes in $\beta$ Cep
stars. Results: A comparison between the mode frequencies of the different
models at various stages during the main sequence evolution reveals that they
are more sensitive to a change in temperature gradient than to the exact shape
of the mixing profile in the near-core region. Depending on the duration of the
observed light curve, one can distinguish between either just the temperature
gradient, or also between the shapes of the mixing coefficient. The relative
frequency differences are in general larger for more evolved models, and are
largest for the higher-frequency pressure modes in $\beta$ Cep stars.
Conclusions:In order to unravel the core boundary mixing and thermal structure
of the near-core region, one must have asteroseismic masses and radii with

the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition is shifted from the quantum
critical point (QCP) at $J_c$ to $J^*$ in the gapped phase by a value $|J^* -
J_c| = B^2/36$, where $B^2$ is a transition width controlling the asymptotic
form of the correlation length $\xi \sim \exp(-B/\sqrt{|J-J_c|})$ in that
phase. This is in contrast to the conventional continuous QCP where the maximum
is an indicator of the position of the critical point. The shape of the peak is
universal, emphasizing the close connection between fidelity susceptibility and
the correlation length. We support those arguments with numerical matrix
product state simulations of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the
thermodynamic limit, where the broad peak is located at $J^*=0.212$ that is
significantly different from $J_c=0.3048(3)$. In the spin-$3/2$ XXZ model the
shift from $J_c=1$ to $J^*=1.0021$ is small but the narrow universal peak is
much more pronounced over the non-universal background.

outflow rate of dM/dt = 1-4 Mo/yr and a mass loading of dM/dt/SFR = 0.2--0.4.
The mass loading of the wind does not show a strong trend with star-formation

stellar mass such that dM/dt/SFR ~ M*^(0.26+/-0.07). Finally, we find that the
line width of the broad H-alpha increases with disk circular velocity with a
sub-linear scaling relation FWHM_broad ~ v^(0.21+/-0.05). As a result of this
behavior, in the lowest mass galaxies (M* < 10^10 Mo), a significant fraction
of the outflowing gas should have sufficient velocity to escape the
gravitational potential of the halo whilst in the highest mass galaxies (M* >

solve an inverse problem. We have implemented and tested three algorithms using

Numerical results are presented for both the elastic case (clover fermions on

case (anisotropic clover lattice with $m_\pi\sim$ 380 MeV and $a_t\sim$ 0.035

Minkowski hadronic tensor gives precisely the vector charge which proves the
feasibility of the approach. While for the latter case, the nucleon resonances
and possibly shallow inelastic scattering contributions around $\nu=1$ GeV are
clearly observed but no information is obtained for higher excited states with
$\nu>2$ GeV. A check of the effective masses of $\rho$ meson with different
lattice setups indicates that, in order to reach higher energy transfers, using
lattices with smaller lattice spacings is essential.

describing Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC), one of the principal
processes employed to create entangled photons in the laboratory. This state,
coupled to UDW detectors, is used to investigate a single-pixel ghost image
under both inertial and non-inertial settings, and a two-pixel image under
inertial conditions. The reconstructed images obtained for various possible
inputs can be distinguished better than a pure guess, hence the formalism can
be used to describe imaging between non-inertial frames. We briefly consider
the origin of the correlations between the UDW detectors, which don't appear to
arise from the usual notion of entanglement. Finally, we find that the contrast
between the possible outcomes in the single-pixel case follows a curious

from deep UV emission to an ideal substrate for other two dimensional crystals.
Although efforts towards the growth of wafer-scale, high quality material
strongly increased in recent years, the understanding of the actual growth
mechanism still remains fragmentary and premature. Here, we unveil fundamental
growth mechanisms by investigating the growth of hBN by metalorganic vapor
phase epitaxy (MOVPE) in a wide range of growth conditions. The obtained
results contradict the widespread opinion about the importance of parasitic
gas-phase reactions decreasing the growth efficiency. Two different growth
mechanisms that depend on ammonia flow and reactor pressure can be
distinguished. Both mechanisms are effective in the case of polycrystalline
growth, but the growth of highly ordered, flat layers, is strongly hindered.
The problem is caused by a low efficiency of boron chemisorption on
N-terminated edges of sp2-BN sheets forming the atomic steps on the surface of
the layer. Two-dimensional growth can be activated and sustained by the flow
modulation epitaxy (FME) method, an alternate switching of ammonia and TEB
flows. The success of the FME method is explained in terms of periodic changes
between N- and B-terminated reconstructions at the edges of sp2- BN sheets,
which restore boron chemisorption. The presented results identify the
fundamental growth mechanisms, which is the prerequisite for any further
deterministic development of efficient, high-quality, large-scale hBN growth
with MOVPE.

particularly for scaling variational inference to deeper architectures
involving high dimensional weight space. We propose MOdel Priors with Empirical
Bayes using DNN (MOPED) method to choose informed weight priors in Bayesian
neural networks. We formulate a two-stage hierarchical modeling, first find the
maximum likelihood estimates of weights with DNN, and then set the weight
priors using empirical Bayes approach to infer the posterior with variational
inference. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach on real-world tasks
including image classification, video activity recognition and audio
classification with varying complex neural network architectures. We also
evaluate our proposed approach on diabetic retinopathy diagnosis task and
benchmark with the state-of-the-art Bayesian deep learning techniques. We
demonstrate MOPED method enables scalable variational inference and provides
reliable uncertainty quantification.

essentially seeking a trajectory leading to some goal state. In such problems,
the way we choose to represent a trajectory underlies algorithms for trajectory
prediction and optimization. Interestingly, most all prior work in imitation
and reinforcement learning builds on a sequential trajectory representation --
calculating the next state in the trajectory given its predecessors. We propose
a different perspective: a goal-conditioned trajectory can be represented by
first selecting an intermediate state between start and goal, partitioning the
trajectory into two. Then, recursively, predicting intermediate points on each
sub-segment, until a complete trajectory is obtained. We call this
representation a sub-goal tree, and building on it, we develop new methods for
trajectory prediction, learning, and optimization. We show that in a supervised
learning setting, sub-goal trees better account for trajectory variability, and
can predict trajectories exponentially faster at test time by leveraging a
concurrent computation. Then, for optimization, we derive a new dynamic
programming equation for sub-goal trees, and use it to develop new planning and
reinforcement learning algorithms. These algorithms, which are not based on the
standard Bellman equation, naturally account for hierarchical sub-goal
structure in a task. Empirical results on motion planning domains show that the
sub-goal tree framework significantly improves both accuracy and prediction
time.

computers we have been able to study more properties of the computed spectra
than was previously possible, and we noted some unexpected features of the
spectra that we now attribute to the unavoidable influence of a finite
measurement volume (MV). The most prominent effect, which initially triggered
these studies, was the appearance of damped oscillations in the higher
frequency range, starting around the cut-off frequency due to the size of the
MV. Using computer generated data mimicking the LDA data, these effects have
previously been shown to appear due to the effect of dead time, i.e., the
finite time during which the system is not able to acquire new measurements.
These dead times can be traced back to the fact that the burst-mode LDA cannot
measure more than one signal burst at a time. Since the dead time is
approximately equal to the residence time for a particle traversing a
measurement volume, we are dealing with widely varying dead times, which,
however, are assumed to be measured for each data point. In addition, the
detector and processor used in the current study introduce a certain amount of
fixed processing and data transfer times, which further contribute to the
distortion of the computed spectrum. However, we show excellent agreement

network-based Trajectory Profile Clustering (TPC) algorithm for 1)
identification of PD subtypes and 2) early prediction of disease progression in
individual patients. Our subtype identification is based not only on PD
variables, but also on their complex patterns of progression, providing a
useful tool for the analysis of large heterogenous, longitudinal data.
Specifically, we cluster patients based on the similarity of their trajectories
through a time series of bipartite networks connecting patients to demographic,
clinical, and genetic variables. We apply this approach to demographic and
clinical data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI)
dataset and identify 3 patient clusters, consistent with 3 distinct PD
subtypes, each with a characteristic variable progression profile.
Additionally, TPC predicts an individual patient's subtype and future disease
trajectory, based on baseline assessments. Application of our approach resulted
in 74% accurate subtype prediction in year 5 in a test/validation cohort.
Furthermore, we show that genetic variability can be integrated seamlessly in
our TPC approach. In summary, using PD as a model for chronic progressive
diseases, we show that TPC leverages high-dimensional longitudinal datasets for
subtype identification and early prediction of individual disease subtype. We
anticipate this approach will be broadly applicable to multidimensional

significant for a projectile moving at a velocity $v$ close to the speed of

take much longer than expected to complete. These straggler tasks are known to
significantly slowdown distributed computation. Job execution with speculative
execution of redundant tasks has been the most widely deployed technique for
mitigating the impact of stragglers, and many recent theoretical papers have
studied the advantages and disadvantages of using redundancy under various
system and service models. However, no clear guidelines could yet be found on
when, for which jobs, and how much redundancy should be employed in
Master-Worker compute clusters, which is the most widely adopted architecture
in modern compute systems. We are concerned with finding a strategy for
scheduling jobs with redundancy that works well in practice. This is a complex
optimization problem, which we address in stages. We first use Reinforcement
Learning (RL) techniques to learn good scheduling principles from realistic
experience. Building on these principles, we derive a simple scheduling policy
and present an approximate analysis of its performance. Specifically, we derive
expressions to decide when and which jobs should be scheduled with how much
redundancy. We show that policy that we devise in this way performs as good as
the more complex policies that are derived by RL. Finally, we extend our
approximate analysis to the case when system employs the other widely deployed
remedy for stragglers, which is relaunching straggler tasks after waiting some
time. We show that scheduling with redundancy significantly outperforms
straggler relaunch policy when the offered load on the system is low or
moderate, and performs slightly worse when the offered load is very high.

efficient and easy to implement. Numerical results verify that the algorithms

significant scalability limitations and have prompted research in novel

been under intense scrutiny due to their low latency broadcast and
architectural flexibility. Thus far, the practicality of the idea has been

little to no attention has been placed on another essential component: the data

as biochemistry and ecology. When the counts of the species are sufficiently
large, the dynamics of their concentrations are typically modeled via a system
of differential equations. However, when the counts of some species are small,
the dynamics of the counts are typically modeled stochastically via a discrete
state, continuous time Markov chain.
  A key quantity of interest for such models is the probability mass function
of the process at some fixed time. Since paths of such models are relatively
straightforward to simulate, we can estimate the probabilities by constructing
an empirical distribution. However, the support of the distribution is often
diffuse across a high-dimensional state space, where the dimension is equal to
the number of species. Therefore generating an accurate empirical distribution
can come with a large computational cost.
  We present a new Monte Carlo estimator that fundamentally improves on the
""classical"" Monte Carlo estimator described above. It also preserves much of
classical Monte Carlo's simplicity. The idea is basically one of conditional
Monte Carlo. Our conditional Monte Carlo estimator has two parameters, and
their choice critically affects the performance of the algorithm. Hence, a key
contribution of the present work is that we demonstrate how to approximate
optimal values for these parameters in an efficient manner. Moreover, we
provide a central limit theorem for our estimator, which leads to approximate
confidence intervals for its error.

frequency domain imaging is used to obtain ground-truth optical properties from
in vivo human hands, freshly resected human esophagectomy samples and
homogeneous tissue phantoms. Images of objects with either flat-field or
structured illumination are paired with registered optical property maps and
are used to train conditional generative adversarial networks that estimate
optical properties from a single input image. We benchmark this approach by
comparing GANPOP to a single-snapshot optical property (SSOP) technique, using
a normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) metric. In human gastrointestinal
specimens, GANPOP estimates both reduced scattering and absorption coefficients
at 660 nm from a single 0.2/mm spatial frequency illumination image with 58%
higher accuracy than SSOP. When applied to both in vivo and ex vivo swine
tissues, a GANPOP model trained solely on human specimens and phantoms
estimates optical properties with approximately 43% improvement over SSOP,
indicating adaptability to sample variety. Moreover, we demonstrate that GANPOP
estimates optical properties from flat-field illumination images with similar
error to SSOP, which requires structured-illumination. Given a training set
that appropriately spans the target domain, GANPOP has the potential to enable
rapid and accurate wide-field measurements of optical properties, even from
conventional imaging systems with flat-field illumination.

human brain is one of the most important open questions in Neurosciences. In
particular, Resting State Networks (RSN) and more specifically the Default Mode
Network (DMN) of the brain, which are defined from the analysis of functional
data lack a definitive justification consistent with the anatomical structure
of the brain. In this work, we show that a possible connection may naturally
rest on the idea that information flows in the brain through a neural
message-passing dynamics between macroscopic structures, like those defined by
the human connectome (HC). In our model, each brain region in the HC is assumed
to have a binary behavior (active or not), the strength of interactions among
them is encoded in the anatomical connectivity matrix defined by the HC, and
the dynamics of the system is defined by a neural message-passing algorithm,
Belief Propagation (BP), working near the critical point of the human
connectome. We show that in the absence of direct external stimuli the BP
algorithm converges to a spatial map of activations that is similar to the DMN.
Moreover, we computed, using Susceptibility Propagation (SP), the matrix of
correlations between the different regions and show that the modules defined by
a clustering of this matrix resemble several Resting States Networks determined
experimentally. Both results suggest that the functional DMN and RSNs can be
seen as simple consequences of the anatomical structure of the brain and a
neural message-passing dynamics between macroscopic regions. We then show
preliminary results indicating our predictions on how functional DMN maps
change when the anatomical brain network suffers structural anomalies, like in

as a graph search problem and perform evolution search in graph space. We
propose Neural Graph Evolution (NGE), which performs selection on current
candidates and evolves new ones iteratively. Different from previous
approaches, NGE uses graph neural networks to parameterize the control
policies, which reduces evaluation cost on new candidates with the help of
skill transfer from previously evaluated designs. In addition, NGE applies
Graph Mutation with Uncertainty (GM-UC) by incorporating model uncertainty,
which reduces the search space by balancing exploration and exploitation. We
show that NGE significantly outperforms previous methods by an order of
magnitude. As shown in experiments, NGE is the first algorithm that can
automatically discover kinematically preferred robotic graph structures, such

re-examined assuming the familiar alpha ($\alpha$) model for isotropic
turbulence. Turbulence always reduces the growth rates of the streaming
instability relative to values calculated for globally laminar disks. While for
small values of the turbulence parameter, $\alpha < 10^{-5}$, the wavelengths
of the fastest-growing disturbances are small fractions of the local gas
vertical scale height $H$, we find that for moderate values of the turbulence
parameter, i.e., $\alpha \sim 10^{-5}-10^{-3}$, the lengthscales of maximally
growing disturbances shift toward larger scales, approaching $H$. At these
moderate turbulent intensities and for local particle to gas mass density
ratios $\epsilon < 0.5$, the vertical scales of the most unstable modes begin
to exceed the corresponding radial scales so that the instability appears in
the form of vertically oriented sheets extending well beyond the particle scale
height. We find that for hydrodynamical turbulent disk models reported in the
literature, with $\alpha = 4\times 10^{-5} - 5\times 10^{-4}$, together with
state of the art global evolution models of particle growth, the streaming
instability is predicted to be viable within a narrow triangular patch of
$\alpha$--$\tau_s$ parameter space centered on Stokes numbers, $\tau_s \sim
0.01$ and $\alpha \sim 4\times 10^{-5}$ and, further, exhibits growth rates on
the order of several hundred to thousands of orbit times for disks with 1
percent ($Z= 0.01$) cosmic solids abundance or metallicity. Our results are
consistent with, and place in context, published numerical studies of streaming
instabilities.

spacetime limit. In arXiv:1708.05674 the key properties for the existence of
these solutions (also referred to as stars or self-gravitating solitons) were
discussed - which include a harmonic time dependence in the matter field -, and
a comparative analysis of the stars arising in the Einstein-Klein-Gordon,
Einstein-Dirac and Einstein-Proca models was performed, for the particular case
of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. In the present work we generalise
this analysis for spinning solutions. In particular, the spinning
Einstein-Dirac stars are reported here for the first time. Our analysis shows
that the high degree of universality observed in the spherical case remains
when angular momentum is allowed. Thus, as classical field theory solutions,
these self-gravitating solitons are rather insensitive to the fundamental
fermionic or bosonic nature of the corresponding field, displaying similar
features. We describe some physical properties and, in particular, we observe
that the angular momentum of the spinning stars satisfies the quantisation
condition $J=m N,$ for all models, where $N$ is the particle number and $m$ is
an integer for the bosonic fields and a half-integer for the Dirac field. The
way in which this quantisation condition arises, however, is more subtle for
the non-zero spin fields.

many more parameters than the size of the training dataset. This paper explores
the generalization capabilities of neural networks trained via gradient
descent. We develop a data-dependent optimization and generalization theory
which leverages the low-rank structure of the Jacobian matrix associated with
the network. Our results help demystify why training and generalization is
easier on clean and structured datasets and harder on noisy and unstructured
datasets as well as how the network size affects the evolution of the train and
test errors during training. Specifically, we use a control knob to split the
Jacobian spectum into ""information"" and ""nuisance"" spaces associated with the
large and small singular values. We show that over the information space
learning is fast and one can quickly train a model with zero training loss that
can also generalize well. Over the nuisance space training is slower and early
stopping can help with generalization at the expense of some bias. We also show
that the overall generalization capability of the network is controlled by how
well the label vector is aligned with the information space. A key feature of
our results is that even constant width neural nets can provably generalize for
sufficiently nice datasets. We conduct various numerical experiments on deep
networks that corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that: (i)
the Jacobian of typical neural networks exhibit low-rank structure with a few
large singular values and many small ones leading to a low-dimensional
information space, (ii) over the information space learning is fast and most of
the label vector falls on this space, and (iii) label noise falls on the
nuisance space and impedes optimization/generalization.

Similarly, a defender's strategy changes over time. These changes may or may

it is important to have a set of quantitative metrics to characterize and

generic and applicable to transform any relevant, quantitative, and/or

dynamics of the flow, which in accreting stellar-mass black holes has shown
increasing evidence for precession due to frame dragging effects that occur
when the black hole spin axis is misaligned with the orbital plane of its
companion star. Recently, theoretical simulations have suggested that the jets
can exert an additional torque on the accretion flow, although the full
interplay between the dynamics of the accretion flow and the launching of the
jets is not yet understood. Here we report a rapidly changing jet orientation
on a timescale of minutes to hours in the black hole X-ray binary V404 Cygni,
detected with very long baseline interferometry during the peak of its 2015
outburst. We show that this can be modelled as Lense-Thirring precession of a
vertically-extended slim disk that arises from the super-Eddington accretion
rate. Our findings suggest that the dynamics of the precessing inner accretion
disk could play a role in either directly launching or redirecting the jets
within the inner few hundred gravitational radii. Similar dynamics should be
expected in any strongly-accreting black hole whose spin is misaligned with the
inflowing gas, both affecting the observational characteristics of the jets,
and distributing the black hole feedback more uniformly over the surrounding
environment.

that the optimal distance of the two-mode components decreases with more loss

reduced order model (ROM) in the framework of an industrially validated
computational fluid dynamics software. This is of special importance in an
industrial environment because in the online phase of the PGD ROM the
description of the flow for a specific set of parameters is obtained simply via
interpolation of the generalised solution, without the need of any extra
solution step. On the one hand, the spatial problems arising from the PGD
separation of the unknowns are treated using the classical solution strategies
of OpenFOAM, namely the semi-implicit method for pressure linked equations
(SIMPLE) algorithm. On the other hand, the parametric iteration is solved via a
collocation approach. The resulting ROM is applied to several benchmark tests
of laminar incompressible Navier-Stokes flows, in two and three dimensions,
with different parameters affecting the flow features. Eventually, the
capability of the proposed strategy to treat industrial problems is verified by
applying the methodology to a parametrised flow control in a realistic geometry

  Access",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article introduces a novel communication paradigm for the unsourced,
uncoordinated Gaussian multiple access problem. The major components of the
envisioned framework are as follows. The encoded bits of every message are
partitioned into two groups. The first portion is transmitted using a
compressive sensing scheme, whereas the second set of bits is conveyed using a
multi-user coding scheme. The compressive sensing portion is key in
sidestepping some of the challenges posed by the unsourced aspect of the
problem. The information afforded by the compressive sensing is employed to
create a sparse random multi-access graph conducive to joint decoding. This
construction leverages the lessons learned from traditional IDMA into creating
low-complexity schemes for the unsourced setting and its inherent randomness.
Under joint message-passing decoding, the proposed scheme offers comparable
performance to existing low-complexity alternatives. Findings are supported by
numerical simulations.

double-occupancies form effective hard-core bosonic excitations, called a
doublons, which are long-lived due to energy conservation. Using time-dependent
density-matrix renormalisation group we investigate numerically the dynamics of
doublons arising from the sudden expansion of a spatially confined
band-insulating state in one spatial dimension. By analysing the occupation
scaling of the natural orbitals within the many-body state, we show that
doublons dynamically quasicondense at the band edges, consistent with the
spontaneous emergence of an eta-quasicondensate. Building on this, we study the
effect of periodically driving the system during the expansion. Floquet
analysis reveals that doublon-hopping and doublon-repulsion are strongly
renormalised by the drive, breaking the eta-SU(2) symmetry of the Hubbard
model. Numerical simulation of the driven expansion dynamics demonstrate that
the momentum in which doublons quasicondense can be controlled by the driving
amplitude. These results point to new pathways for engineering non-equilibrium
condensates in fermionic cold-atom experiments and are potentially relevant to
driven solid-state systems.

probability distributions over subsets of some ground set. They are strictly
more general than strongly Rayleigh (SR) distributions such as the well-known
determinantal point process. While SR distributions offer elegant models of
diversity, they lack an easy control over how they express diversity. We
propose SLC as the right extension of SR that enables easier, more intuitive
control over diversity, illustrating this via examples of practical importance.
We develop two fundamental tools needed to apply SLC distributions to learning

sampler and give theoretical mixing time bounds. For mode finding, we establish
a weak log-submodularity property for SLC functions and derive optimization
guarantees for a distorted greedy algorithm.

are reliable because the iterative computation of the nodes has guaranteed
convergence, and they are fast due to their fourth-order convergence and its
asymptotic exactness for an appropriate selection of the variables. For
Gauss--Hermite and Gauss--Laguerre quadratures, local Taylor series can be used
for computing efficiently the orthogonal polynomials involved, with exact
initial values for the Hermite case and first values computed with a continued
fraction for the Laguerre case. The resulting algorithms have almost
unrestricted validity with respect to the parameters. Full relative precision
is reached for the Hermite nodes, without any accuracy loss and for any degree,
and a mild accuracy loss occurs for the Hermite and Laguerre weights as well as
for the Laguerre nodes. These fast methods are exclusively based on convergent
processes, which, together with the high order of convergence of the underlying

main ways of constructing signature schemes. While the classical security of
this transformation is well understood, it is only very recently that generic
results for the quantum case have been proposed [DFMS19,LZ19]. These results
are asymptotic and therefore can't be used to derive the concrete security of
these signature schemes without a significant loss in parameters.
  In this paper, we show that if we start from a commit-and-open identification
scheme, where the prover first commits to several strings and then as a second
message opens a subset of them depending on the verifier's message, then there
is a tight quantum reduction for the the Fiat-Shamir transform to special
soundness notions. Our work applies to most 3 round schemes of this form and
can be used immediately to derive quantum concrete security of signature
schemes.
  We apply our techniques to several identification schemes that lead to
signature schemes such as Stern's identification scheme based on coding
problems, the [KTX08] identification scheme based on lattice problems, the
[SSH11] identification schemes based on multivariate problems, closely related
to the NIST candidate MQDSS, and the PICNIC scheme based on multiparty

bundles, mostly motivated by Fell ($C^*$-algebraic) bundles, and the sectional
algebras associated to them. As the main motivational example, Steinberg
algebras may be regarded as the sectional algebras of trivial (direct product)
bundles. Several theorems which relate geometric and algebraic constructions -
via the construction of a sectional algebra - are widely generalized: Direct
products bundles by semigroupoids correspond to tensor products of algebras;
Semidirect products of bundles correspond to ""na\""ive"" crossed products of
algebras; Skew products of graded bundles correspond to smash products of
graded algebras; Quotient bundles correspond to quotient algebras. Moreover,
most of the results hold in the non-Hausdorff setting. In the course of this
work, we generalize the definition of smash products to groupoid graded
algebras.
  As an application, we prove that whenever $\theta$ is a $\land$-preaction of
a discrete inverse semigroupoid $S$ on an ample (possibly non-Hausdorff)
groupoid $\mathcal{G}$, the Steinberg algebra of the associated groupoid of
germs is naturally isomorphic to a crossed product of the Steinberg algebra of
$\mathcal{G}$ by $S$. This is a far-reaching generalization of analogous
results which had been proven in particular cases.

an open neighborhood of this submanifold modeled on a neighborhood of the zero

to the case of Higgs bundles over a Riemann surface, where the (co)tangent

boundary controllers for an unstable 1-D diffusion-reaction partial
differential equation with spatially-varying reaction. Using ""folding""
transforms the parabolic PDE into a 2X2 coupled parabolic PDE system with
coupling via folding boundary conditions. The folding approach is novel in the
sense that the design of bilateral controllers can be generalized to centering
around arbitrary points, which admit additional design parameters for both the
state-feedback controller and the state observer. The design can be selectively
biased to achieve different performance indicies (e.g. energy, boundedness,
etc). A first backstepping transformation is designed to map the unstable
system into a strict-feedback intermediate target system. A second backstepping
transformation is designed to stabilize the intermediate target system. The
invertibility of the two transformations guarantees that the derived
state-feedback controllers exponentially stabilize the trivial solution of the
parabolic PDE system in the L^2 norm sense. A complementary state observer is
likewise designed for the dual problem, where two collocated measurements are
considered at an arbitrary point in the interior of the domain. The observer
generates state estimates which converge to the true state exponentially fast
in the L^2 sense. Finally, the output feedback control law is formulated by
composing the state-feedback controller with the state estimates from the
observer, and the resulting dynamic feedback is shown to stabilize the trivial
solution of the interconnected system in the L^2 norm sense. Some analysis on
how the selection of these points affect the responses of the controller and
observer are discussed, with simulations illustrating various choices of
folding points and their effect on the stabilization.

Their inherent ability to learn complex functional mappings between data and
various target variables, while discovering hidden, task-driven features, makes
them a powerful technology in a wide variety of applications. Nonetheless, the
success of these networks typically relies on the availability of sufficient
training data to optimize a large number of free parameters while avoiding
overfitting, especially for networks with large capacity. In scenarios with
limited training budgets, e.g., supervised tasks with limited labeled samples,
several generic and/or task-specific regularization techniques, including data
augmentation, have been applied to improve the generalization of deep
networks.Typically such regularizations are introduced independently of that
data or training scenario, and must therefore be tuned, tested, and modified to
meet the needs of a particular network. In this paper, we propose a novel
regularization framework that is driven by the population-level statistics of
the feature space to be learned. The regularization is in the form of a
\textbf{cooperating subnetwork}, which is an auto-encoder architecture attached
to the feature space and trained in conjunction with the primary network. We

Therefore, the fine tuning problem can be solved quite well. Furthermore, the
Hubble parameter $H_{1}(z)$ as a function of redshift $z$ is in good agreement
with cosmic chronometers dataset. The evolution of the universe naturally
shifts from deceleration to acceleration. This demonstrates that the evolution

implemented in the numerical simulations involving complex geometries, such as
particle-laden flows, their performances are seldom compared systematically
over the same local quantities within the same context. In this paper, we
present a systematic comparative investigation on some frequently used and most
state-of-the-art interpolated bounce-back schemes and immersed boundary
methods, based on both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations of four
selected 2D and 3D laminar flow problems. Our analyses show that immersed
boundary methods (IBM) typically yield a first-order accuracy when the
regularized delta-function is employed to interpolate velocity from the
Eulerian to Lagrangian mesh, and the resulting boundary force back to the
Eulerian mesh. This first order in accuracy for IBM is observed for both the
local velocity and hydrodynamic force/torque, apparently different from the
second-order accuracy sometimes claimed in the literature. Another serious
problem of immersed boundary methods is that the local stress within the
diffused fluid-solid interface tends to be significantly underestimated. On the
other hand, the interpolated bounce-back generally possesses a second-order
accuracy for velocity, hydrodynamic force/torque, and local stress field. The
main disadvantage of the interpolated bounce-back schemes is its higher level
of fluctuations in the calculated hydrodynamic force/torque when a solid object
moves across the grid lines. General guidelines are also provided for the
necessary grid resolutions in the two approaches in order to accurately
simulate flows over a solid particle.

fixed-wing UAVs with speed constraints in 2D plane. The objective is to steer a
fleet of UAVs along the path(s) while achieving the desired sequenced inter-UAV
arc distance. In contrast to the previous coordinated path following studies,
we are able through our proposed hybrid control law to deal with the forward
speed and the angular speed constraints of fixed-wing UAVs. More specifically,
the hybrid control law makes all the UAVs work at two different levels: those
UAVs whose path following errors are within an invariant set (i.e., the
designed coordination set) work at the coordination level; and the other UAVs
work at the single-agent level. At the coordination level, we prove that even
with speed constraints, the proposed control law can make sure the path
following errors reduce to zero, while the desired arc distances converge to
the desired value. At the single-agent level, the convergence analysis for the
path following error entering the coordination set is provided. We develop a
hardware-in-the-loop simulation testbed of the multi-UAV system by using actual
autopilots and the X-Plane simulator. The effectiveness of the proposed
approach is corroborated with both MATLAB and the testbed.

electromagnetic fields and fluid motion are governed by the Grad-Shafranov
equation and the Bernoulli equation, respectively. Assuming steady and
axisymmetric jet structure, we can self-consistently obtain electromagnetic
fields, fluid energy density and velocity within the jet, given proper plasma
loading and boundary conditions. Specifically, we structure the two coupled
governing equations as two eigenvalue problems, and develop full numerical
techniques for solving them. As an example, we explicitly solve the governing
equations for the split monopole magnetic field configuration and simplified
plasma loading on the stagnation surface where the poloidal fluid velocity
vanishes. As expected, we find the rotation of magnetic field lines is dragged
down by fluid inertia, and the fluid as a whole does not contribute to energy
extraction from the central BH, i.e., the magnetic Penrose process is not
working. However, if we decompose the charged fluid as two oppositely charged
components, we find the magnetic Penrose process does work for one of the two
components when the plasma loading is low enough.

relativity comes from the eikonal/geometric optics approximation. According to
the well-established eikonal model, the fundamental quasinormal mode represents
wavepackets orbiting in the vicinity of the black hole's geodesic photon ring,
slowly peeling off towards the event horizon and infinity. Besides its strength
as a ""visualisation"" tool, the eikonal approximation also provides a simple
quantitative method for calculating the mode frequency, in close agreement with
rigorous numerical results. In this paper we move away from Einstein's theory
and its garden-variety black holes and go on to consider spherically symmetric
black holes in modified theories of gravity through the lens of the eikonal
approximation. The quasinormal modes of such black holes are typically
described by a set of coupled wave equations for the various field degrees of
freedom. Considering a general, theory-agnostic, system of two equations for
two perturbed fields, we derive eikonal formulae for the complex fundamental
quasinormal mode frequency. In addition we show that the eikonal modes can be
related to the extremum of an effective potential and its associated ""photon
ring"". As an application of our results we consider a specific example of a
modified theory of gravity with known black hole quasinormal modes and find
that these are well approximated by the eikonal formulae.

  paper; 27 pages; 7 figures",,,,"cs.CC cs.DS math.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The study of parameterized streaming complexity on graph problems was
initiated by Fafianie et al. (MFCS'14) and Chitnis et al. (SODA'15 and
SODA'16). Simply put, the main goal is to design streaming algorithms for
parameterized problems such that $O\left(f(k)\log^{O(1)}n\right)$ space is
enough, where $f$ is an arbitrary computable function depending only on the
parameter $k$. However, in the past few years, very few positive results have
been established. Most of the graph problems that do have streaming algorithms
of the above nature are ones where localized checking is required, like Vertex
Cover or Maximum Matching parameterized by the size $k$ of the solution we are
seeking. Many important parameterized problems that form the backbone of
traditional parameterized complexity are known to require $\Omega(n)$ bits for
any streaming algorithm; e.g., Feedback Vertex Set, Even/Odd Cycle Transversal,
Triangle Deletion or the more general ${\cal F}$-Subgraph Deletion when
parameterized by solution size $k$.
  Our main conceptual contribution is to overcome the obstacles to efficient
parameterized streaming algorithms by utilizing the power of parameterization.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in parameterized streaming
complexity that considers structural parameters instead of the solution size as
a parameter. We focus on the vertex cover size $K$ as the parameter for the
parameterized graph deletion problems we consider. At the same time, most of
the previous work in parameterized streaming complexity was restricted to the
EA (edge arrival) or DEA (dynamic edge arrival) models. In this work, we
consider the above mentioned graph deletion problems in the four most
well-studied streaming models, i.e., the EA, DEA, VA (vertex arrival) and AL
(adjacency list) models.

We introduce methodology from the BOED literature to approximate this optimal
behaviour, and use it to generate `near-optimal' sequences of attention
locations. We then show how to use such sequences to partially supervise, and
therefore speed up, the training of a hard attention mechanism. Although
generating these sequences is computationally expensive, they can be reused by
any other networks later trained on the same task.

structure of the algebra of observables and its relation to the space of
states. An important feature of this point of view is that subsystems can be
described by subalgebras, with partial trace being replaced by the more general
notion of restriction to a subalgebra. This, in turn, has recently led to
applications to the study of entanglement in systems of identical particles. In
the course of those investigations on entanglement and particle identity, an
emergent gauge symmetry has been found by Balachandran, de Queiroz and Vaidya.
In this letter we establish a novel connection between that gauge symmetry,
entropy production and quantum operations. Thus, let A be a system described by
a finite dimensional observable algebra and $\omega$ a mixed faithful state.
Using the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) representation we construct a canonical
purification of $\omega$, allowing us to embed A into a larger system C. Using
Tomita-Takasaki theory, we obtain a subsystem decomposition of C into
subsystems A and B, without making use of any tensor product structure. We
identify a group of transformations that acts as a gauge group on A while at
the same time giving rise to entropy increasing quantum operations on C. We
provide physical means to simulate this gauge symmetry/quantum operation

additional flexibility required by power system to support the increasing
penetration of renewable energy sources. The integrating large number of
resources in the existing market structure, particularly in the light of
providing flexibility services, is envisioned through the concept of virtual

for VPP flexibility modelling. In this context, this paper first puts forward
the need to clarify the difference between feasibility and flexibility
potential of a VPP, and then propose a methodology for the evaluation of
relevant operating regions. Similar concepts can also be used to modelling
TSO/DSO interface operation. Several case studies are designed to reflect the
distinct information conveyed by feasibility and flexibility operating regions
in the presence of ""slow"" and ""fast"" responding resources for a VPP partaking
in provision of energy and grid support services. The results also highlight
the impact of flexible load and importantly network topology on the VPP
feasibility (FOR) and flexibility (FXOR) operating regions.

quenches in Lifshitz free scalar theories, with the dynamical exponent $z>1$,
by using the correlator method. For quantum quenches we consider two types of
time-dependent mass functions: end-critical-protocol (ECP) and
cis-critical-protocol (CCP). In both cases, at early times the entanglement
entropy is independent of the subsystem size. After a critical time ($t_c$),
the entanglement entropy starts depending on the subsystem size significantly.
This critical time $t_c$ for $z = 1$ in the fast ECP and CCP has been explained
well by the fast quasi-particle of the quasi-particle picture. However, we find
that for $z > 1$ this explanation does not work and $t_c$ is delayed. We
explain why $t_c$ is delayed for $z>1$ based on the quasiparticle picture: in
essence, it is due to the competition between the fast and slow quasiparticles.
At late times, in the ECP, the entanglement entropy slowly increases while, in
the CCP, it is oscillating with a well defined period by the final mass scale,
independently of $z$. We give an interpretation of this phenomena by the
correlator method. As $z$ increases, the entanglement entropy increases, which
can be understood by long-range interactions due to $z$.

However, due to different sensor characteristics and acquisition times,
high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) and low-resolution MS image pairs tend to
have large pixel misalignments, especially for moving objects in the images.
Conventional CNNs trained with only the spectral loss with these satellite

double-edge artifacts along strong edges and ghosting artifacts on moving
objects. In this letter, we propose a novel loss function, called a
spectral-spatial structure (S3) loss, based on the correlation maps between MS

for pan-sharpening with various types of CNN structures, resulting in
significant visual improvements on PS images with suppressed artifacts.

the complicated nature of interfaces which involves complex factors such as

especially true for metal nonmetal interfaces which incorporate multiple
fundamental heat transport mechanisms such as elastic and inelastic phonon
scattering as well as electron phonon coupling in the metal and across the
interface. All these factors jointly affect thermal boundary conductance (TBC).
As a result, the experimentally measured interfaces may not be the same as the
ideally modelled interfaces, thus obfuscating any conclusions drawn from
experimental and modeling comparisons. This work provides a systematic study of
interfacial thermal conductance across well controlled and ultraclean epitaxial

(AGF) and a nonequilibrium Landauer approach shows that elastic phonon
scattering dominates the interfacial thermal transport of Al sapphire
interface. By scaling the TBC with the Al heat capacity, a nearly constant
transmission coefficient is observed, indicating that the phonons on the Al
side limits the Al sapphire TBC. This nearly constant transmission coefficient
validates the assumptions in AGF and nonequilibrium Landauer calculations. Our
work not only provides a benchmark for interfacial thermal conductance across

theoretical thermal carrier transport mechanisms, but also acts as a reference

within the disease domain and a mutual-attention mechanism jointly between
diseases and procedures. This framework captures the clinical relationships
between the disease codes and procedures associated with hospital admissions,
and it predicts procedures according to diagnosed diseases. A self-attention
network is learned to fuse the embeddings of the diseases for each admission.
The similarities between the fused disease embedding and the procedure
embeddings indicate which procedure should potentially be recommended.
Additionally, when learning the embeddings of the ICD codes, the optimal
transport between the diseases and the procedures within each admission is
calculated as a regularizer of the embeddings. The optimal transport provides a
mutual-attention map between diseases and the procedures, which suppresses the
ambiguity within their clinical relationships. The proposed method achieves
clinically-interpretable embeddings of ICD codes, and outperforms
state-of-the-art embedding methods in procedure recommendation.

intrinsic bandgap and high electron mobility, has attracted great attention due
to its unique electronic, optical, mechanical and thermal properties. Although
thermal conductivity of SLMoS2 has been widely investigated recently, less
studies focus on molybdenum disulfide nanotube (MoS2NT). Here, the
comprehensive temperature, size and strain effect on thermal conductivity of
MoS2NT are investigated. A chirality-dependent strain effect is identified in
thermal conductivity of zigzag nanotube, in which the phonon group velocity can
be significantly reduced by strain. Besides, results show that thermal
conductivity has a ~T-1 and a ~L\b{eta} relation with temperature from 200 to
400 K and length from 10 to 320 nm, respectively. This work not only provides
feasible strategies to modulate the thermal conductivity of MoS2NT, but also
offers useful insights into the fundamental mechanisms that govern the thermal
conductivity, which can be used for the thermal management of low dimensional
materials in optical, electronic and thermoelectrical devices. Introduction.

labels by discarding noisy samples from the training set or assigning weights
to training samples, where the weight associated with a noisy sample is
expected to be small. Thereby, these previous efforts result in a waste of
samples, especially those assigned with small weights. The input $x$ is always
useful regardless of whether its observed label $y$ is clean. To make full use
of all samples, we introduce a manifold regularizer, named as Paired Softmax
Divergence Regularization (PSDR), to penalize the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence between softmax outputs of similar inputs. In particular, similar
inputs can be effectively generated by data augmentation. PSDR can be easily
implemented on any type of DNNs to improve the robustness against noisy labels.
As empirically demonstrated on benchmark datasets, our PSDR impressively

relies on a large training set, which is very expensive to achieve in remote
sensing. The semi-supervised manifold alignment (SSMA), a multi-modal data
fusion algorithm, has been designed to amplify the impact of an existing
training set by linking labeled data to unlabeled data via unsupervised
techniques. In this paper, we explore the potential of SSMA in fusing optical
data and polarimetric SAR data, which are multi-sensory data sources.
Furthermore, we propose a MAPPER-induced manifold alignment (MIMA) for
semi-supervised fusion of multi-sensory data sources. Our proposed method
unites SSMA with MAPPER, which is developed from the emerging topological data
analysis (TDA) field. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that SSMA
has been applied on fusing optical data and SAR data, and also the first time
that TDA has been applied in remote sensing. The conventional SSMA derives a
topological structure using k-nearest-neighbor (kNN), while MIMA employs
MAPPER, which considers the field knowledge and derives a novel topological
structure through the spectral clustering in a data-driven fashion. Experiment
results on data fusion with respect to land cover land use classification and
local climate zone classification suggest superior performance of MIMA.

we have studied possible modifications to inclusive jet yields and a set of jet
shape observables, namely, the fragmentation functions and radial momentum
distributions when jets propagate through a deconfined partonic medium created
in collisions of heavy nuclei at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies. Jets are
reconstructed with anti-k T algorithm in the pseudorapidity range $|\eta_{\rm
jet} | < 2.1$ for resolution parameter R= 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4. For background
subtraction, a Jewel-compatible 4-Momenta subtraction technique (4MomSub) have
been used. The modification of inclusive jet-yields in Pb-Pb collisions
relative to proton-proton interactions, quantified by $R^{\rm jet}_{AA}$, are
seen to be in reasonable agreement with ALICE, ATLAS and CMS data over a broad
transverse momentum range. Jewel is able to capture the qualitative features of
the modifications to the fragmentation functions and radial momentum
distributions in data but not always quantitatively. This quantitative
discrepancy may be related to the simplified treatment of recoil partons in the
background model and partly due to background subtraction procedure itself.
Nevertheless, observed modification of jet shape variables in Jewel
corroborates the fact that in-medium fragmentation is harder and more
collimated than the fragmentation in vacuum. We further observe that these
modifications depend on the transverse momentum of jets and it seems that
medium resolves the core structure of low momentum jets below 100 GeV/c at LHC
energies.

alignment of two ticking grandfather clocks, to the mutual entrainment of
beating flagella or spiking neurons. Yet both biological and manmade systems
provide striking examples of spontaneous desynchronization, such as failure
cascades in alternating current power grids or neuronal avalanches in the
mammalian brain. Here, we generalize classical models of synchronization among
heterogenous oscillators to include short-range phase repulsion among
individuals, a property that abets the emergence of a stable desynchronized
state. Surprisingly, we find that our model exhibits self-organized avalanches
at intermediate values of the repulsion strength, and that these avalanches
have similar statistical properties to cascades seen in real-world systems such
as neuronal avalanches. We find that these avalanches arise due to a critical
mechanism based on competition between mean field recruitment and local
displacement, a property that we replicate in a classical cellular automaton
model of traffic jams. We exactly solve our system in the many-oscillator
limit, and obtain analytical results relating the onset of avalanches or
partial synchrony to the relative heterogeneity of the oscillators, and their
degree of mutual repulsion. Our results provide a minimal
analytically-tractable example of complex dynamics in a driven critical system.

$(I+L)^{-s } e^{itL}$ is bounded on $L^p(X)$ for $s> n|{1/ 2}-{1/p}| $ and $

and the stellar irradiation, we calculated about 450 models covering planets
with different densities and stellar irradiation. Our results show that the
mass loss rates are dependent on the stellar irradiation and the mean density.
However, the mass loss rates predicted by the energy-limited equation are
higher than that of hydrodynamic model when the XUV integrated flux is higher
than $\sim$2$\times$10$^{4}$ erg/cm$^{2}$/s. The overestimation can be revised
if the kinetic and thermal energy of the escaping atmosphere is included in the
energy-limited equation. We found that the heating efficiencies are
proportional to the product of the gravitational potential of the planet and
the stellar irradiation. The mean absorption radii of stellar irradiation are
1.1-1.2 R$_{p}$ for the Jupiter-like planets while they vary in the range of
1.1-1.7 R$_{p}$ for the planets with smaller sizes. We evaluated the absorption
of stellar Ly$\alpha$ by planetary atmosphere and found that the deeper
Ly$\alpha$ absorptions tend to locate in the high stellar irradiation and low
planetary mean density regions, and vice versa. Moreover, planets with mass
loss rates higher than 10$^{11} g/s$ are likely to exhibit obvious absorptions.
Finally, we suggested that the absorption levels are related to the inherent
properties of the exoplanets. The planets with larger sizes (or lower mean
density) show strong Ly$\alpha$ absorptions. Neptune-like and Earth-like
planets tend to have weak Ly$\alpha$ absorptions because of their small sizes
(or high densities).

illuminant chromaticity from a single image is an ill-posed task, in general,
and existing solutions typically employ a variety of assumptions and
heuristics. In this paper, we present a new, physically-based, approach for
estimating illuminant chromaticity from interreflections of light between
diffuse surfaces. Our approach assumes that all of the direct illumination in
the scene has the same chromaticity, and that at least two areas where
interreflections between Lambertian surfaces occur may be detected in the
image. No further assumptions or restrictions on the illuminant chromaticty or
the shading in the scene are necessary. Our approach is based on representing
interreflections as lines in a special 2D color space, and the chromaticity of
the illuminant is estimated from the approximate intersection between two or
more such lines. Experimental results are reported on a dataset of illumination
and surface reflectance spectra, as well as on real images we captured. The
results indicate that our approach can yield state-of-the-art results when the

unsatisfactory image quality. While informative image priors may be learned
using generic deep neural network architectures, the artefacts caused by an
ill-conditioned design matrix often have global spatial support and cannot be
efficiently filtered out by means of convolutions. In this paper we propose to
learn an inverse mapping in an end-to-end fashion via unrolling optimization
iterations of a prototypical reconstruction algorithm. We herein introduce a
network architecture that performs filtering jointly in both sinogram and

explicit bound for the degrees of the monic right factors in terms of the
degree and the order of the original operator, as well as the largest modulus
of the local exponents at all its singularities. As a consequence, if a
differential operator $L$ has rational function coefficients over a number

the order and the height of $L$, and of the degree of the number field.

  and Supply-limited Growth","15 pages, 13 figures, this is a pre-copyedited, author-produced
  version of an article accepted for publication in MNRAS following peer review",,"10.1093/mnras/stz1629",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Studies of internal structure of gas giant planets suggest that their
envelopes are enriched with heavier elements than hydrogen and helium relative
to their central stars. Such enrichment likely occurred by solid accretion
during late formation stages of gas giant planets in which gas accretion
dominates protoplanetary growth. Some previous studies performed orbital
integration of planetesimals around a growing protoplanet with the assumption
of an uniform circumstellar disc to investigate how efficiently the protoplanet
captures planetesimals. However, not only planetesimals but also disc gas are
gravitationally perturbed by the protoplanet in its late formation stages,
resulting in gap opening in the circumstellar disc. In this study, we
investigate the effects of such gap formation on the capture of planetesimals
by performing dynamical simulations of planetesimals around a growing proto-gas
giant planet. Gap formation reduces the surface density of disc gas, makes a
steep pressure gradient and limits the growth rate of the protoplanet. We find
that the first effect enhances the capture of planetesimals, while the others
reduce it. Consequently the amount of planetesimals captured during the gas
accretion is estimated to be at most ~3 Mearth. We conclude that the in-situ
capture of planetesimals needs the initial solid surface density more than five
times higher than that of the minimum mass solar nebula for explaining the
inferred large amount of heavy element in Jupiter. For highly dense warm
Jupiters, we would need additional processes enhancing the capture and/or
supply of planetesimals.

number of individuals in a population. The analysis of such data, especially in
the aspect of individualized inferences and solutions, has the potential to
create significant value for practical applications. Traditionally, inference
for an individual in the data set is either solely relying on the information
of the individual or from summarizing the information about the whole
population. However, with the availability of big data, we have the
opportunity, as well as a unique challenge, to make a more effective
individualized inference that takes into consideration of both the population
information and the individual discrepancy. To deal with the possible
heterogeneity within the population while providing effective and credible
inferences for individuals in a data set, this article develops a new approach
called the individualized group learning (iGroup). The iGroup approach uses
local nonparametric techniques to generate an individualized group by pooling
other entities in the population which share similar characteristics with the
target individual, even when individual estimates are biased due to limited
number of observations. Three general cases of iGroup are discussed, and their
asymptotic performances are investigated. Both theoretical results and
empirical simulations reveal that, by applying iGroup, the performance of
statistical inference on the individual level are ensured and can be
substantially improved from inference based on either solely individual
information or entire population information. The method has a broad range of
applications. Two examples in financial statistics and maritime anomaly
detection are presented.

theory reduction and approximation, origin of a paradox, and the reality of

them as the results of the acceptance of pure logical artifacts. In physics

describe this particular status of DADAM. We then provide an overview of our

the bulk of these notes. For convenience, we first describe the phenomenology
of simple active particle models representing the basic DADAM classes, limiting
ourselves to two spatial dimensions, where most work has been performed. Then
we discuss the continuous hydrodynamic theories derived from these models using
the Boltzmann-Ginzburg-Landau approach. We show in particular that they are
largely faithful to the microscopic level, albeit qualitatively. In the
conclusion, we come back to the nodal situation of DADAM within active matter
studies and provide perspectives on how one can expand DADAM knowledge into
various directions, approaching more realistic and more complex situations in a
controlled way.

mature manufacturing technologies, filament wound carbon fiber reinforced
polymers represent ideal materials for thin-walled laminate structures.
However, their strong anisotropy reduces structural resistance to wall
instabilities under shear and buckling. Increasing laminate thickness degrades
weight and structural efficiencies and the application of a dense internal core
is often uneconomical and labor-intensive. In this contribution, we introduce a
convex linear semidefinite programming formulation for truss topology
optimization to design an efficient non-uniform lattice-like internal
structure. The internal structure not only reduces the effect of wall
instabilities, mirrored in the increase of the fundamental free-vibration
eigenfrequency, but also keeps weight low, secures manufacturability using
conventional three-dimensional printers, and withstands the loads induced
during the production process. We showcase a fully-automatic procedure in
detail for the design, prototype manufacturing, and verification of a
simply-supported composite machine tool component, including validation with
roving hammer tests. The results confirm that the 3D-printed optimized internal
structure almost doubles the fundamental free-vibration eigenfrequency,
allowing to increase working frequency of the machine tool, even though the
ratio between elastic properties of the carbon composite and the ABS polymer
used for 3D printing exceeds two orders of magnitude.

sputtering of Si by bombardment with noble gas ions. The energy distributions
in dependence on ion beam parameters (ion energy: 0.5 - 1 keV; ion species: Ne,
Ar, Xe) and geometrical parameters (ion incidence angle, polar emission angle,
scattering angle) are measured by means of energy-selective mass spectrometry.
The presence of anisotropic effects due to direct sputtering and scattering is
discussed and correlated with process parameters. The experimental results are
compared to calculations based on a simple elastic binary collision model and
to simulations using the Monte-Carlo code SDTrimSP. The influence of the
contribution of implanted primary ions on energy distributions of sputtered and
scattered particles is studied in simulations. It is found that a 10\%
variation of the target composition leads to detectable but small differences
in the energy distributions of scattered ions. Comparison with previously
reported data for other ion/target configurations confirms the presence of
similar trends and anisotropic effects: the number of high-energy sputtered
ions increases with increasing energy of incident ions and decreasing
scattering angle. The effect of the ion/target mass ratio is additionally
investigated. Small differences are observed with the change of the primary ion
species: the closer the mass ratio to unity, the higher the average energy of
sputtered ions. The presence of peaks, assigned to different mechanisms of
direct scattering, strongly depends on the ion/target mass ratio.

  Mir-BFT is the first BFT protocol that allows multiple leaders to propose
request batches independently (i.e., parallel leaders), in a way that precludes
request duplication attacks by malicious (Byzantine) clients, by rotating the
assignment of a partitioned request hash space to leaders.
  As this mechanism removes a single-leader bandwidth bottleneck and exposes a
computation bottleneck related to authenticating clients even on a WAN, our
protocol further boosts throughput using a client signature verification
sharding optimization.
  Our evaluation shows that Mir-BFT outperforms state-of-the-art and orders
more than 60000 signed Bitcoin-sized (500-byte) transactions per second on a
widely distributed 100 nodes, 1 Gbps WAN setup, with typical latencies of few

  We also evaluate Mir-BFT under different crash and Byzantine faults,
demonstrating its performance robustness.
  Mir-BFT relies on classical BFT protocol constructs, which simplifies
reasoning about its correctness.
  Specifically, Mir-BFT is a generalization of the celebrated and scrutinized

but it is inefficient partially because of backward locking, which means
updating the weights of one layer locks the weight updates in the other layers.
Consequently, it is challenging to apply parallel computing or a pipeline
structure to update the weights in different layers simultaneously. In this
paper, we introduce a novel learning structure called associated learning (AL),
which modularizes the network into smaller components, each of which has a
local objective. Because the objectives are mutually independent, AL can learn
the parameters in different layers independently and simultaneously, so it is
feasible to apply a pipeline structure to improve the training throughput.
Specifically, this pipeline structure improves the complexity of the training
time from O(nl), which is the time complexity when using BP and stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) for training, to O(n + l), where n is the number of
training instances and l is the number of hidden layers. Surprisingly, even
though most of the parameters in AL do not directly interact with the target
variable, training deep models by this method yields accuracies comparable to
those from models trained using typical BP methods, in which all parameters are
used to predict the target variable. Consequently, because of the scalability
and the predictive power demonstrated in the experiments, AL deserves further
study to determine the better hyperparameter settings, such as activation
function selection, learning rate scheduling, and weight initialization, to
accumulate experience, as we have done over the years with the typical BP
method. Additionally, perhaps our design can also inspire new network designs
for deep learning. Our implementation is available at

periods. At the very early phases of stellar evolution, this distribution is
set by the star-disc locking mechanism. The primordial disc lifetime and,
consequently, the duration of the disc-locking mechanism, can be significantly
shortened by the presence of a close companion, making the rotation period
distribution of close binaries different from that of either single stars or
wide binaries. We use new data to investigate and better constrain the range of
ages, the components separation and the mass ratio dependence at which the
rotation period distribution has been significantly affected by the disc
dispersal that is enhanced by close companions. We select a sample of close
binaries in the Upper Scorpius association (age $\sim$8 Myr) whose components
have measured the separation and the rotation periods and compare their period
distribution with that of coeval stars that are single stars. We find that
components of close binaries have on average rotation periods shorter than
single stars. More precisely, binaries with about equal-mass components (0.9
$\le$ M2/M1 $\le$ 1.0) have rotation periods on average by $\sim$0.4 d shorter
than single stars; binaries with smaller mass ratios (0.8 $<$ M2/M1 $<$ 0.9)
have rotation periods on average by $\sim$1.9 d the primary components, and by
$\sim$1.0 d the secondary components shorter than single stars. A comparison
with the older 25-Myr $\beta$ Pictoris association shows that, whereas in the
latter all close binaries with projected separation $\rho$ $\le$ 80 AU all
rotate faster than single stars, in the Upper Scorpius that has happened for
about 70% stars, yet. We interpret the enhanced rotation in close binaries with
respect to single stars as the consequence of an early disc dispersal induced

Such a polynomial kernelization also exists for any $\mathcal{F}$ containing a

that the problem does not admit a polynomial Turing kernel. Our hardness result
generalizes to any $\mathcal{F}$ not containing a $P_3$-subgraph-free graph,

a transceiver structure to maximize the worst-case rate of the user while
satisfying a total transmit power constraint. Most of the existing solutions
either perform user Mean Squared Error (MSE) balancing or streamwise rate
balancing, which is suboptimal in the MIMO case. The original rate balancing
problem in the downlink is complicated due to the coupled structure of the
transmit filters. This optimization problem is here solved in an alternating
manner by exploiting weighted MSE uplink/downlink duality with proven
convergence to a local optimum. Simulation results are provided to validate the
proposed algorithm and demonstrate its performance improvement over unweighted
MSE balancing.

Analysis of Boolean functions, such as the KKL (Kahn-Kalai-Linial) theorem,
Friedgut's junta theorem and the invariance principle of Mossel, O'Donnell and
Oleszkiewicz. In these results the cube is equipped with the uniform
($1/2$-biased) measure, but it is desirable, particularly for applications to
the theory of sharp thresholds, to also obtain such results for general
$p$-biased measures. However, simple examples show that when $p$ is small there
is no hypercontractive inequality that is strong enough for such applications.
  In this paper, we establish an effective hypercontractivity inequality for
general $p$ that applies to `global functions', i.e. functions that are not
significantly affected by a restriction of a small set of coordinates. This
class of functions appears naturally, e.g. in Bourgain's sharp threshold
theorem, which states that such functions exhibit a sharp threshold. We
demonstrate the power of our tool by strengthening Bourgain's theorem, thereby
making progress on a conjecture of Kahn and Kalai. An additional application of
our hypercontractivity theorem, is a $p$-biased analog of the seminal
invariance principle of Mossel, O'Donnell, and Oleszkiewicz. In a companion
paper, we give applications to the solution of two open problems in Extremal

LGD blocks, where each block updates local and global features by modeling the
diffusions between these two representations. Diffusions effectively interact
two aspects of information, i.e., localized and holistic, for more powerful way
of representation learning. Furthermore, a kernelized classifier is introduced
to combine the representations from two aspects for video recognition. Our LGD
networks achieve clear improvements on the large-scale Kinetics-400 and
Kinetics-600 video classification datasets against the best competitors by 3.5%

Eilenberg-Moore algebras and their homomorphisms (by exploiting duality between

the branching and linear type. Moreover, we state a Kleene-like theorem
characterising the regular morphisms category in terms of the smallest
subcategory closed under certain operations. Additionally, whenever the

preventing double-spending; this is usually solved by achieving consensus on
the order of transfers among the participants. In this paper, we treat the
asset transfer problem as a concurrent object and determine its consensus
number, showing that consensus is, in fact, not necessary to prevent
double-spending. We first consider the problem as defined by Nakamoto, where
only a single process---the account owner---can withdraw from each account.
Safety and liveness need to be ensured for correct account owners, whereas
misbehaving account owners might be unable to perform transfers. We show that
the consensus number of an asset transfer object is $1$. We then consider a
more general $k$-shared asset transfer object where up to $k$ processes can
atomically withdraw from the same account, and show that this object has
consensus number $k$. We establish our results in the context of shared memory
with benign faults, allowing us to properly understand the level of difficulty
of the asset transfer problem. We also translate these results in the message

practice. In this model, we describe an asynchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant
asset transfer implementation that is both simpler and more efficient than

established interlayer spin-exchange coupling mechanisms at their van der Waals
gaps using first-principle calculations. The BSC-like behavior offers a
distance-dependent interlayer anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) to ferromagnetic (FM)
transition. This phenomenon is explained with the spin-exchange coupling
mechanisms established using bilayer CrSe2 as a prototype in this work. The Se
pz wavefunctions from two adjacent interfacial Se sublayers overlap at the
interlayer region. The spin alignment of the region determines interlayer
magnetic coupling. At a shorter interlayer distance, Pauli repulsion at the
overlapped region dominates and thus favors anti-parallel oriented spins
leading to interlayer AFM. For a longer distance, kinetic energy gain of
polarized electrons across the bilayer balances the Pauli repulsion and the
bilayer thus prefers an interlayer FM state. In light of this, the AFM-FM
transition is a result of competition between Pauli and Coulomb repulsion and
kinetic energy gain. All these results open a new route to tune interlayer
magnetism and the revealed spin-exchange coupling mechanisms are paramount
additions to those previously established ones.

$\lesssim$4 keV full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) for 20-100 keV X-rays is

nitrogen temperatures conventionally used to achieve fine energy resolution.
High-yield production is also required for GAPS, which consists of
$\gtrsim$1000 detectors. Our specially-developed Si crystal and custom methods
of Li evaporation, diffusion and drifting allow for a thick, large-area and
uniform sensitive layer. We find that retaining a thin undrifted layer on the

dominant component of the energy resolution at these temperatures. A guard-ring
structure and optimal etching of the detector surface are also confirmed to
suppress the leakage current. We report on the mass production of these

the early stages of star formation is crucial to constrain star and
circumstellar disk formation theories. The specific angular momentum is
directly related to the largest Keplerian disk possible, and it could constrain
the angular momentum removal mechanism. We determine $j(r)$ towards two Class 0
objects and a first hydrostatic core candidate in the Perseus cloud, which is
consistent across all three sources and well fit with a single power-law
relation between 800 and 10,000\,au:
$j_{fit}(r)=10^{-3.60\pm0.15}\left(r/\textrm{1,000au}\right)^{1.80\pm0.04}$ km
s$^{-1}$ pc. This power-law relation is in between solid body rotation
($\propto r^2$) and pure turbulence ($\propto r^{1.5}$). This strongly suggests
that even at 1,000\,au, the influence of the dense core's initial level of
turbulence or the connection between core and the molecular cloud is still
present. The specific angular momentum at 10,000\,au is $\approx3\times$ higher
than previously estimated, while at 1,000\,au it is lower by $2\times$. We do
not find a region of conserved specific angular momentum, although it could
still be present at a smaller radius. We estimate an upper limit to the largest
Keplerian disk radius of 60\,au, which is small but consistent with published
upper limits. Finally, these results suggest that more realistic initial
conditions for numerical simulations of disk formation are needed. Some
possible solutions include: a) use a larger simulation box to include some
level of driven turbulence or connection to the parental cloud, or b)
incorporate the observed $j(r)$ to setup the dense core kinematics initial

is an important problem because it determines the launching of winds and the
feasibility of the magnetorotational instability to generate turbulence or
channel flows. Recent studies, both semi-analytical calculations and numerical
simulations, have highlighted the crucial role non-ideal MHD effects (Ohmic
resistivity, Hall drift and ambipolar diffusion), relevant in the
protoplanetary disc context, might play in magnetic flux evolution in the disc.
We investigate the flux transport in discs through the use of two
one-dimensional semi-analytic models in the vertical direction, exploring
regimes where different physical source terms and effects dominate. The
governing equations for both models are derived by performing an asymptotic
expansion in the limit of a thin disc, with the different regimes isolated
through setting the relative order of the leading terms between variables. Flux
transport rates and vertical structure profiles are calculated for a range of
diffusivities and disc magnetisations. We found that Ohmic and ambipolar
diffusivities drive radially outward flux transport with an outwardly inclined
field. A wind outflow drives inward flux transport, which is significantly
enhanced in the presence of Hall drift in the positive polarity case, $\eta_H
(\boldsymbol{B}_z \cdot \boldsymbol{\Omega}) > 0$, an effect which has only
been briefly noted before. Coupled only with outward inclination, the Hall
effect reduces the flux transport given by a background Ohmic and/or ambipolar
diffusivity, but drives no flux transport when it is the only non-ideal effect
present.

star winds in order to estimate the effects of clumping in density and
velocity. XSTAR (Kallman,2018) was used to calculate radiation pressure in
spectral lines (force multiplier FM) in Sobolev approximation (Castor et al.,
1975 CAK; Stevens and Kallman, 1990). FM was computed as a function of two
parameters: Xi and t. The line force was included in the momentum equation and
mass conservation. These were integrated in the supersonic part of the wind for
a sample of OB- and WR-stars. Fitting with the velocity-law gives mass loss
rate and outflow velocity as outputs. The boundary condition of the subsonic
part and the velocity law were approximated by using a beta-law formulation
with beta = 0.6 and Vin = 10 km/s. It is found that WR-stars , owing to their
large absorption, had already at r/Rstar = 1.01 radiation spectra lacking soft
X-rays below 230 Angstroem (HeII ionization). This crucial fact enhances the
force multiplier by a factor of 10, making it possible to accelerate their
winds in the CAK-framework. Hence, the momentum problem is an opacity problem
(Gayley et al. ,1995). Results for OB-stars point to a moderate density
clumping (Fvol=0.13). In addition, main sequence OB-stars require velocity
clumping (Fvel=0.1, Sundqvist et al 2014). This can explain the weak wind
problem.

carried by each pattern, normalized by the number of synapses, and find that it
can reach a value $\alpha_\text{max}\simeq 0.27$, similar to the one of
sequence processing neural networks, and almost double of the capacity of the
static Hopfield model. We study the dependence of the capacity on the global
inhibition, connection strength (or neuron threshold) and fraction of neurons
participating to the patterns. The results show that a dual population and
temporal coding can be optimal for the capacity of an associative memory.

requires re-identification (re-ID) algorithms to obtain accurate counts and
moving trajectory of wildlife. However, existing re-ID methods are largely
targeted at persons and cars, which have limited pose variations and
constrained capture environments. This paper tries to fill the gap by
introducing a novel large-scale dataset, the Amur Tiger Re-identification in
the Wild (ATRW) dataset. ATRW contains over 8,000 video clips from 92 Amur
tigers, with bounding box, pose keypoint, and tiger identity annotations. In
contrast to typical re-ID datasets, the tigers are captured in a diverse set of
unconstrained poses and lighting conditions. We demonstrate with a set of
baseline algorithms that ATRW is a challenging dataset for re-ID. Lastly, we
propose a novel method for tiger re-identification, which introduces precise
pose parts modeling in deep neural networks to handle large pose variation of
tigers, and reaches notable performance improvement over existing re-ID
methods. The dataset is public available at https://cvwc2019.github.io/ .

overcome this limitation with a study of the X-ray emitting late-type
main-sequence stars observed by XMM-Newton and Kepler. We measure rotation
periods from photometric variability in Kepler light curves. As activity
indicators, we adopt the X-ray luminosity, the number frequency of white-light
flares, the amplitude of the rotational photometric modulation, and the
standard deviation in the Kepler light curves. The search for X-ray flares in
the light curves provided by the EXTraS (Exploring the X-ray Transient and
variable Sky) FP-7 project allows us to identify simultaneous X-ray and
white-light flares. A careful selection of the X-ray sources in the Kepler
field yields 102 main-sequence stars with spectral types from A to M. We find
rotation periods for 74 X-ray emitting main-sequence stars, 22 of which without
period reported in the previous literature. In the X-ray activity/rotation
relation, we see evidence for the traditional distinction of a saturated and a
correlated part, the latter presenting a continuous decrease in activity
towards slower rotators. For the optical activity indicators the transition is
abrupt and located at a period of ~ 10 d but it can be probed only marginally
with this sample which is biased towards fast rotators due to the X-ray
selection. We observe 7 bona-fide X-ray flares with evidence for a white-light
counterpart in simultaneous Kepler data. We derive an X-ray flare frequency of
~ 0.15 d^{-1} , consistent with the optical flare frequency obtained from the
much longer Kepler time-series.

mathematical model with two populations differing only in dispersal ability and
whose one-dimensional territories are spatially segregated. Although the motion
of the border between the two territories remains elusive in general, all cases
investigated in the literature concur: either the border does not move at all
because of some environmental heterogeneity or the fast diffuser chases the
slow diffuser. Counterintuitively, it is better to randomly explore the hostile
enemy territory, even if it means highly probable death of some individuals,
than to ""stay united"". This directly contradicts a celebrated result on the
intermediate competition case, emphasizing the importance of the competition
intensity. Overall, the larger picture remains unclear and the optimal strategy
regarding dispersal remains ambiguous. Several open problems worthy of a

While variance estimation for dynamic regression is a natural problem, with a

following fundamental question: In terms of data characteristics, what does the
convergence rate depend on? In this paper we study the global system operator
-- the operator that maps the noise vectors to the output. We obtain estimates
on its spectrum, and as a result derive the first known variance estimators
with finite sample complexity guarantees. The proposed bounds depend on the
shape of a certain spectrum related to the system operator, and thus provide
the first known explicit geometric parameter of the data that can be used to
bound estimation errors. In addition, the results hold for arbitrary sub
Gaussian distributions of noise terms. We evaluate the approach on synthetic

general pairs of distinct doubling weights. For example, assuming the measures
satisfy a fractional A infinity condition and are comparable in the sense of
Coifman and Fefferman, we characterize the two weight norm inequality for a
strongly elliptic fractional Calder\'on-Zygmund singular integral, in terms of
the one-tailed fractional Muckenhoupt conditions, and the usual cube testing
conditions. We then apply this result to give a version, in the setting of two
comparable fractional A infinity weights, of Stein's characterization of
cancellation conditions on a kernel K in order that there exists a bounded
operator T that is associated with K. More generally we prove a T1 theorem
involving a bilinear indicator/cube testing inequality in place of the weak
boundedness property of David and Journe\'e - where we must test over all
bounded functions instead of just Holder continuous functions. We use a proof
strategy based on an adaptation of the `pivotal' argument of Nazarov, Treil and

seen interest in the use of adaptive designs (ADs) grow substantially in recent
years. Accordingly, much research has been conducted to identify potential
barriers to increasing the use of ADs in practice, and several articles have
argued that the availability of user-friendly software will be an important
step in making ADs easier to implement. Therefore, in this paper we present a
review of the current state of software availability for AD. Methods: We first
review articles from 31 journals published in 2013-17 that relate to
methodology for adaptive trials, in order to assess how often code and software
for implementing novel ADs is made available at the time of publication. We
contrast our findings against these journals' current policies on code
distribution. Secondly, we conduct additional searches of popular code
repositories, such as CRAN and GitHub, to identify further existing
user-contributed software for ADs. From this, we are able to direct interested
parties towards solutions for their problem of interest by classifying
available code by type of adaptation. Results: Only 29% of included articles
made their code available in some form. In many instances, articles published
in journals that had mandatory requirements on code provision still did not
make code available. There are several areas in which available software is
currently limited or saturated. In particular, many packages are available to
address group sequential design, but comparatively little code is present in
the public domain to determine biomarker-guided ADs. Conclusions: There is much
room for improvement in the provision of software alongside AD publications.
Additionally, whilst progress has been made, well-established software for
various types of trial adaptation remains sparsely available.

modeling has been carried out to propose some more transitions which would
potentially be targeted in the millimeter wave domain. Gas-grain chemical
network was used to explain the observed abundance of PrO in a cold shell
surrounding the high-mass star-forming region of Sgr B2. Quantum chemical
calculations were employed to study various reaction parameters and to compute
multiple vibrational frequencies of PrO. To model the formation of PrO in the
observed region, we considered a dark cloud model. Additionally, we used a
model to check the feasibility of forming PrO in the hot core region. Some
potential transitions in the millimeter wave domain are predicted which could
be useful for the future astronomical detection. Radiative transfer modeling
has been utilized to extract the physical condition which might be useful to
know the properties of the source in detail. Moreover, vibrational transitions
of PrO has been provided which could be very useful for the future detection of
PrO by the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

the distinction between classical and quantum theory. This principle sets a
bound on our ability to predict the measurement outcome of two incompatible
observables precisely. Uncertainty principle can be formulated via Shannon
entropies of the probability distributions of measurement outcome of the two
observables. It has shown that the entopic uncertainty bound can be improved by
considering an additional particle as the quantum memory $B$ which has
correlation with the measured particle $A$. In this work we consider the memory
assisted entropic uncertainty for the case in which the quantum memory and
measured particle are topological qubits. In our scenario the topological
quantum memory $B$, is considered as an open quantum system which interacts
with its surrounding. The motivation for this model is associated with the fact
that the basis of the memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relation is
constructed on the correlation between quantum memory $B$ and measured particle
$A$. In the sense that, Bob who holds the quantum memory $B$ can predict
Alice's measurement results on particle $A$ more accurately, when the amount of
correlation between $A$ and $B$ is great. Here, we want to find the influence
of environmental effects on uncertainty bound while the quantum memory
interacts with its surrounding. In this work we will consider Ohmic-like

stability of amyloid fibrils is not well understood: specifically the balance
between entropic and enthalpic terms, including the chain entropy and the
hydrophobic effect, are poorly characterised. Using simulations of a
coarse-grained protein model we delineate the enthalpic and entropic
contributions dominating amyloid fibril elongation, predicting a characteristic
temperature-dependent enthalpic signature. We confirm this thermodynamic
signature by performing calorimetric experiments and a meta-analysis over
published data. From these results, we can also elucidate the necessary
conditions to observe cold denaturation of amyloid fibrils. Overall, we show
that amyloid fibril elongation is associated with a negative heat capacity, the
magnitude of which correlates closely with the hydrophobic surface area that is
buried upon fibril formation, highlighting the importance of hydrophobicity for
fibril stability.

analysis and nonlinear simulations, we demonstrate that this competition is a
function of the radius $r_0$ of the circular region initially occupied by the
less viscous fluid in the porous medium. For each $r_0$, we further determine
the stability in terms of P\'eclet number ($Pe$) and log-mobility ratio ($M$).
The $Pe-M$ parameter space is divided into stable and unstable zones--the
boundary between the two zones is well approximated by $M =\alpha(r_0)
Pe^{-0.55}$. In the unstable zone, the instability is reduced (enhanced) with
an increase (decrease) in $r_0$. Thus, a natural control measure for miscible

information that is provided to customers. Hence, to optimize the design of

two extreme versions are usually considered and compared: the observable in
which customers are informed about the number of customers in the system and
the unobservable in which they are only informed about the system parameters,
e.g., arrival and service rates. In the present work, we study a model that
bridges these two versions. More concretely, we assume that the system
alternates between observable and unobservable periods. We characterize and
compute customer equilibrium joining/balking strategies and show that the
present model unifies and extends existing approaches of both heterogeneously
observable models and models with delayed observations. More importantly, our
findings indicate that an alternating information structure implies in general
higher equilibrium throughput and social welfare in comparison to both the
observable and unobservable cases. We complement our results with numerical

good deal more complex than originally thought by Wigner and Hungtinton in
their seminal paper predicting metal hydrogen2): the electrons and the protons
are strongly coupled to each other and ultimately must be treated equally3)4).
The determination of how and when molecular solid hydrogen will transform into
a metal is the stepping stone towards a full understanding of the quantum-many
body properties of dense hydrogen. The quest for metal hydrogen has pushed
major developments of modern experimental high pressure physics, yet the
various claims of its observation over the past 30 years have remained
controversial5)6)7). Here we show a first order phase transition near 425 GPa
from insulator molecular solid hydrogen to metal hydrogen. Pressure in excess
of 400 GPa could be achieved by using the recently developed Toroidal Diamond
Anvil Cell (T-DAC)8). The structural and electronic properties of dense solid
hydrogen at 80 K have been characterized by synchrotron infrared spectroscopy.
The continuous vibron frequency shift and the electronic band gap closure down
to 0.5 eV, both linearly evolving with pressure, point to the stability of the
insulator C2/c-24 phase up to the metallic transition. Upon pressure release,
the metallic state transforms back to the C2/c-24 phase with almost no
hysteresis, hence suggesting that the metallization proceeds through a
structural transformation within the molecular solid, presumably to the Cmca-12
structure. Our results are in good agreement with the scenario recently
disclosed by an advanced calculation able to capture many-body electronic

  Patterns and Case Complexity","Submitted to 64th Annual Conference of the German Association for
  Medical Informatics, 8 pages",,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Emergency department (ED) care for frail elderly patients is associated with
an increased use of resources due to their complex medical needs and frequently
difficult psycho-social situation. To better target their needs with specially
trained staff, it is vital to determine the times during which these particular
patients present to the ED. Recent research was inconclusive regarding this
question and the applied methods were limited to coarse time windows. Moreover,
there is little research on time variation of frail ED patients' case
complexity. This study examines differences in arrival rates for frail vs.
non-frail patients in detail and compares case complexity in frail patients
within vs. outside of regular GP working hours. Arrival times and case
variables (admission rate, ED length of stay [LOS], triage level and
comorbidities) were extracted from the EHR of an ED in an urban German teaching
hospital. We employed Poisson time series regression to determine patterns in
hourly arrival rates over the week. Frail elderly patients presented more
likely to the ED during already high frequented hours, especially at midday and
in the afternoon. Case complexity for frail patients was significantly higher
compared to non-frail patients, but varied marginally in time only with respect
to triage level and ED LOS. The results suggest that frailty-attuned emergency
care should be available in EDs during the busiest hours. Based on EHR data,
hospitals thus can tailor their staff needs.

Solar Probe (PSP) turbulent time signals even when Taylor's hypothesis is not
valid. By extending Kraichnan's sweeping model used in hydrodynamics we derive
the Eulerian spacetime correlation function in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
turbulence. It is shown that in MHD, the temporal decorrelation of small-scale
fluctuations arises from a combination of hydrodynamic sweeping induced by
large-scale fluid velocity $\delta u_0$ and by the Alfv\'enic propagation along
the local magnetic field. The resulting temporal part of the space-time
correlation function is used to determine the wavenumber range $\Delta
k_\perp=[k_{\rm min},k_{\rm max}]$ of the turbulent fluctuations that
contribute to the power of a given frequency $\omega$ of the time signal
measured in the spacecraft frame. Our analysis also shows that the shape of
frequency power spectrum $P_{sc}(\omega)$ of the time signal will follow the
same power-law of the reduced power spectrum $E(k_\perp)\sim k^{-\alpha}_\perp$
in the plasma frame, where $\alpha$ is the spectral index. The proposed
framework for the analysis of PSP time signals entirely relies on two simple
dimensionless parameters that can be empirically obtained from PSP
measurements, namely, $\epsilon=\delta u_0/\sqrt 2 V_\perp$ (where $V_\perp$ is
the perpendicular velocity of PSP seen in the plasma frame) and the spectral
index $\alpha$.

significant enough to affect the dynamics of the H II region where $w=2$, and

find that photoionisation feedback from massive stars is the principal mode of
feedback on molecular cloud scales, driving accelerating outflows from
molecular clouds in cases where the peaked density structure around young
massive stars is considered at radii between $\sim$0.1 and 10-100 pc. Under a

experiment. We consider a scenario when scalar (vector) leptoquark $S_1$
($U_1$) couples exclusively to the down quark and the neutrinos (charged
leptons) of all flavors, where the leptoquark in question couples to the SM
lepton doublets. The couplings of $S_1$ ($U_1$) to the up-type quarks and the

parameter space originate from flavor physics measurements, followed by the LHC
search limits that take over the flavor physics ones in the large LQ mass
regime. We furthermore show that $S_1$ ($U_1$) marginally improves (spoils) the
fit of the current IceCube data with respect to the SM case within the region

interpolate the data: the empirical loss can be driven to near zero on all
samples simultaneously. In this work, we explicitly exploit this interpolation
property for the design of a new optimization algorithm for deep learning,
which we term Adaptive Learning-rates for Interpolation with Gradients (ALI-G).
ALI-G retains the two main advantages of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD),
which are (i) a low computational cost per iteration and (ii) good
generalization performance in practice. At each iteration, ALI-G exploits the
interpolation property to compute an adaptive learning-rate in closed form. In
addition, ALI-G clips the learning-rate to a maximal value, which we prove to
be helpful for non-convex problems. Crucially, in contrast to the learning-rate
of SGD, the maximal learning-rate of ALI-G does not require a decay schedule,
which makes it considerably easier to tune. We provide convergence guarantees
of ALI-G in various stochastic settings. Notably, we tackle the realistic case
where the interpolation property is satisfied up to some tolerance. We provide
experiments on a variety of architectures and tasks: (i) learning a
differentiable neural computer; (ii) training a wide residual network on the
SVHN data set; (iii) training a Bi-LSTM on the SNLI data set; and (iv) training
wide residual networks and densely connected networks on the CIFAR data sets.
ALI-G produces state-of-the-art results among adaptive methods, and even yields
comparable performance with SGD, which requires manually tuned learning-rate
schedules. Furthermore, ALI-G is simple to implement in any standard deep
learning framework and can be used as a drop-in replacement in existing code.

Often these can be thought of representing a real-valued function on a
high-dimensional domain, and can be conceptually arranged in the format of a
tensor of high degree in some truncated or lossy compressed format. We look at
some common post-processing tasks which are not obvious in the compressed
format, as such huge data sets can not be stored in their entirety, and the
value of an element is not readily accessible through simple look-up. The tasks
we consider are finding the location of maximum or minimum, or minimum and
maximum of a function of the data, or finding the indices of all elements in
some interval --- i.e. level sets, the number of elements with a value in such
a level set, the probability of an element being in a particular level set, and
the mean and variance of the total collection.
  The algorithms to be described are fixed point iterations of particular
functions of the tensor, which will then exhibit the desired result. For this,
the data is considered as an element of a high degree tensor space, although in
an abstract sense, the algorithms are independent of the representation of the
data as a tensor. All that we require is that the data can be considered as an
element of an associative, commutative algebra with an inner product. Such an
algebra is isomorphic to a commutative sub-algebra of the usual matrix algebra,
allowing the use of matrix algorithms to accomplish the mentioned tasks. We
allow the actual computational representation to be a lossy compression, and we
allow the algebra operations to be performed in an approximate fashion, so as
to maintain a high compression level. One such example which we address
explicitly is the representation of data as a tensor with compression in the
form of a low-rank representation.

can trace total molecular gas in our resolved galaxies on kpc scales. We
investigate the dependence of L'_[CI](1-0)/L'_CO(1-0), L'_[CI](2-1)/L'_CO(1-0)
and [CI] excitation temperature T_ex on dust temperature T_dust, and find
non-correlation, a weak and modest correlation, respectively. The ratio of
L'_[CI](1-0)/L'_CO(1-0) stays smooth distribution in most galaxies, indicating
that the conversion factor of [CI](1-0) luminosity to H_2 mass (X_[CI](1-0))
changes with CO(1-0) conversion factor (\alpha_CO) proportionally. Under
optically thin and LTE assumptions, we derive a galaxy-wide average carbon
excitation temperature T_ex ~ 19.7 \pm 0.5K and an average neutral carbon
abundance X[CI]/X[H_2] ~2.5 \pm 1.0 * 10^{-5} in our resolved sample, which is
comparable to the usually adopted value of 3*10^{-5}, but ~3 times lower than
the carbon abundance in local (U)LIRGs. We conclude that the carbon abundance
varies in different galaxy types.

assessing the impact of contingencies is becoming more and more crucial.
Contingencies of interest can be roughly classified into nodal power
disturbances and line faults. Despite their higher relevance, line
contingencies have been significantly less investigated analytically than nodal
disturbances. The main reason for this is that nodal power disturbances are
additive perturbations, while line contingencies are multiplicative
perturbations, which modify the interaction graph of the network. They are,
therefore, significantly more challenging to tackle analytically. Here, we
assess the direct impact of a line loss by means of the maximal Rate of Change
of Frequency (RoCoF) incurred by the system. We show that the RoCoF depends on
the initial power flow on the removed line and on the inertia of the bus where
it is measured. We further derive analytical expressions for the expectation
and variance of the maximal RoCoF, in terms of the expectations and variances
of the power profile in the case of power systems with power uncertainties.
This gives analytical tools to identify the most critical lines in an electric

radii: 1.e-4 < R(AU) < 1.e7. Our models are fully convective, but all have a
two-zone character with the majority of the mass in a small, condensate-free
core, surrounded by a colder envelope where phase equilibrium obtains.
Convection in the envelope is unusual in that it is driven by a
mean-molecular-weight inversion, rather than by an entropy gradient. In fact
the entropy gradient is itself inverted, leading to the surprising result that
envelope convection transports heat inwards. In turn that permits the outer
layers to maintain steady state temperatures below the cosmic microwave
background. Amongst our hydrostatic equilibria we identify thermal equilibria
appropriate to the Galaxy, in which radiative cooling from H2 is balanced by
cosmic-ray heating. These equilibria are all thermally unstable, albeit with
very long thermal timescales in some cases. The specific luminosities of all
our models are very low, and they therefore describe a type of baryonic dark
matter. Consequently such clouds are thermally fragile: when placed in a harsh
radiation field they will be unable to cool effectively and disruption will
ensue as heat input drives a secular expansion. Disrupting clouds should leave
trails of gas and H2 dust in their wake, which might make them easier to
detect. Our models may be relevant to the cometary globules in the Helix

are collected in video frames, their efficacy can be multiplied for free by
using motion cues. To explore this idea, we introduce DensePose-Track, a
dataset of videos where selected frames are annotated in the traditional
DensePose manner. Then, building on geometric properties of the DensePose
mapping, we use the video dynamic to propagate ground-truth annotations in time
as well as to learn from Siamese equivariance constraints. Having performed
exhaustive empirical evaluation of various data annotation and learning
strategies, we demonstrate that doing so can deliver significantly improved
pose estimation results over strong baselines. However, despite what is
suggested by some recent works, we show that merely synthesizing motion
patterns by applying geometric transformations to isolated frames is
significantly less effective, and that motion cues help much more when they are

aimed to perform several tests of post-Newtonian gravity around the Earth with
a preferably drag-free spacecraft moving along a highly elliptical path fixed

possible scenarios: a fast, 4-hr orbit with high perigee height of
$1,047\,\mathrm{km}$, and a slow, 21-hr path with a low perigee height of
$642\,\mathrm{km}$. HERO may detect, for the first time, the post-Newtonian
orbital effects induced by the mass quadrupole moment $J_2$ of the Earth which
affects the semimajor axis $a$ via a secular trend of $\simeq
4-12\,\mathrm{cm\,yr}^{-1}$, depending on the orbital configuration. Recently,
the secular decay of the semimajor axis of the passive satellite LARES was
measured with an error as little as $0.7\,\mathrm{cm\,yr}^{-1}$. Also the
post-Newtonian spin dipole (Lense-Thirring) and mass monopole (Schwarzschild)
effects could be tested to a high accuracy depending on the level of
compensation of the non-gravitational perturbations. Moreover, the large
eccentricity of the orbit would allow to constrain several long-range modified
models of gravity and to accurately measure the gravitational red-shift as
well. Each of the six Keplerian orbital elements could be individually
monitored to extract the $GJ_2/c^2$ signature, or they could be suitably
combined in order to disentangle the post-Newtonian effect(s) of interest from
the competing mismodeled Newtonian secular precessions induced by the zonal
harmonic multipoles $J_\ell$ of the geopotential. In the latter case, the
systematic uncertainty due to the current formal errors $\sigma_{J_\ell}$ of a
recent global Earth's gravity field model are better than $1\%$ for all the
post-Newtonian effects considered, with a peak of $\simeq 10^{-7}$ for the

sensitivity experiments proposed within the CMIP6/DCPP-C framework, the
wintertime AMV/Europe teleconnection is investigated in large ensembles of
pacemaker-type simulations in the CNRM-CM5 global circulation model. To
evaluate the sensitivity of the model response to the AMV amplitude,
experiments with AMV-forcing pattern multiplied by 2 and 3 (hereafter 2xAMV and
3xAMV, respectively) are performed in complement to the reference ensemble
(1xAMV). Based on a flow analog method, the AMV-forced atmospheric circulation
is found to cool down the European continent, whereas the residual signal,
mostly including thermodynamical processes, contributes to warming. In 1xAMV,
both terms cancel each other, explaining the overall weak AMV-forced
atmospheric signal. In 2xAMV and 3xAMV, the thermodynamical contribution
overcomes the dynamical cooling and is responsible for milder and wetter
conditions. The thermodynamical term includes the advection of warmer and more
humid oceanic air penetrating inland and the modification of surface radiative
fluxes linked to (i) altered cloudiness and (ii) snow-cover reduction acting as
a positive feedback with the AMV amplitude. The dynamical anomalous circulation
combines (i) a remote response to enhanced diabatic heating acting as a
Rossby-wave source in the western tropical Atlantic and (ii) a local response
associated with warmer SST over the subpolar gyre favorizing an anomalous High.
The weight between the tropical-extratropical processes and associated
feedbacks is speculated to partly explain the nonlinear sensibility of the
response to the AMV-forcing amplitude, challenging thus the use of the
so-called pattern-scaling technique.

this paper, we review methods by which to mitigate the effects of charged
impurities and defects in graphene devices. Using capping layers such as
fluoropolymers, statistically significant improvement of mobility, on/off

effects are also reversible and can be attributed to the presence of highly

fluoropolymer acting to electrostatically screen charged impurities and defects
in or near the graphene. In other experiments, graphene FETs were exposed to
vapour-phase, polar, organic molecules in an ambient environment. This resulted
in significant improvement to electrical characteristics, and the magnitude of
improvement to the Dirac point scaled with the dipole moment of the delivered

presence of polar molecules. We present strong evidence that the polar nature
of capping layers or polar vapour molecules introduced to the surface of a

CPT. While the global symmetry governs the existence of massless Goldstone

We show that even when the CPT-symmetries are broken on the level of the action

occurs at higher order. We discuss the parameter space of some of the models in

physical regions are bounded by exceptional points in different ways. There
exist special points in parameter space for which massless bosons may occur

the Z-score. We also investigate different approaches for partitioning in
nonparametric density estimation which can improve the significance of results.

transfer, on hourly timescales, in directions of both sentiment to price and of

the non-smooth quantile loss poses new challenges to high-dimensional
distributed estimation in both computation and theoretical development. To
address the challenge, we transform the response variable and establish a new
connection between quantile regression and ordinary linear regression. Then, we
provide a distributed estimator that is both computationally and
communicationally efficient, where only the gradient information is
communicated at each iteration. Theoretically, we show that, after a constant

standard unary aggregation and binary join operators. These implement the
classical model of computing joins between relations two at a time,
materializing the intermediate results, and then proceeding to do either
sort-based or hash-based aggregate computation to derive the final result. This
approach, however, can be dramatically sub-optimal in the case of
low-selectivity joins, and often ends up generating large intermediate results
even if the relations involved as well as the final result sets themselves are
quite small. Moreover, many of the computed intermediate results may never be
part of the final result. In this paper we propose a novel aggregate query
processing technique that leverages graph data structures towards efficiently
answering aggregate queries over joins, without materializing intermediate join
results. We wrap this technique inside a multi-way composite database operator
called JOIN-AGG that combines Join and Aggregation. We provide a general
framework for executing aggregation queries over arbitrary acyclic joins,
involving any number of group-by attributes from any relation. We also present
a thorough experimental evaluation on both real world and synthetic datasets.

missions this tally will increase. Understanding the climate dependence on the
planetary parameters is vital for the study of terrestrial exoplanet
habitability. Using an idealized general circulation model with a seasonal
cycle, we study the seasonal response of the surface temperature and Hadley
circulation to changes in the orbital, rotational and radiative timescales.
Analyzing the climate's seasonal response to variations in these timescales, we
find a regime transition between planets controlled by the annual mean
insolation to planets controlled by the seasonal variability depending on the
relation between the length of the orbital period, obliquity and radiative
timescale. Consequently, planets with obliquity greater than $54^{\circ}$ and
short orbital period will have a minimum surface temperature at the equator. We
also show that in specific configurations, mainly high atmospheric mass and
short orbital periods, high obliquity planets can still have an equable
climate. Based on the model results, we suggest an empirical power law for the
ascending and descending branches of the Hadley circulation and its strength.
These power laws show that the Hadley circulation becomes wider and stronger by
increasing the obliquity and orbital period or by decreasing the atmospheric
mass and rotation rate. Consistent with previous studies, we show that the
rotation rate plays an essential role in dictating the width of the Hadley
circulation.

than emulating each output individually, we define a metric in the reduced

that projection using the $L_2$ norm can result in different conclusions, with
the ordering of points not maintained on the basis, with implications for both

existing deep learning methods for noise modeling generally require clean and
noisy image pairs for model training; these image pairs are difficult to obtain
in many realistic scenarios. To ameliorate this problem, we propose a
self-consistent GAN (SCGAN), that can directly extract noise maps from noisy
images, thus enabling unsupervised noise modeling. In particular, the SCGAN
introduces three novel self-consistent constraints that are complementary to
one another, viz.: the noise model should produce a zero response over a clean
input; the noise model should return the same output when fed with a specific
pure noise input; and the noise model also should re-extract a pure noise map
if the map is added to a clean image. These three constraints are simple yet
effective. They jointly facilitate unsupervised learning of a noise model for
various noise types. To demonstrate its wide applicability, we deploy the SCGAN
on three image processing tasks including blind image denoising, rain streak
removal, and noisy image super-resolution. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art methods
on a variety of benchmark datasets, even though the noise types vary
significantly and paired clean images are not available.

These models are known as interacting particles systems and are simple enough
to be treated analytically but also complex enough to capture essential
physical behaviours. The thesis is organized in two parts. The part 1 is
devoted to the microscopic theory of the stationary states. We characterize
these states developing some general structures that have an interest in
themselves. In this part there is an interlude dedicated to discrete calculus
on discrete manifolds with an exposition a little bit different to the one
available in literature and some original definitions. The part 2 studies the
problem macroscopically. In particular we consider the large deviations
asymptotic behavior for a class of solvable one dimensional models of heat
conduction. Both part 1 and 2 begin with an introduction of motivational
character followed by an overview of the relevant results and a summary
explaining the organization. Even tough the two parts are strictly connected

such a way to be self-consistent as much as possible.

formalism but instead as remnants of unitary transformations under which the

quantum observable corresponds to a unitary representation of an abelian Lie
group, the irreducible subrepresentations of which correspond to the
observable's outcomes. It is shown that this identification agrees with the
conventional identification as self-adjoint operators. The upshot of this
formalism is that one may 'second quantize' the representation to which an
observable corresponds, thus obtaining the corresponding Fock space
representation. This Fock space representation is then also identifiable as an
observable in the same sense, the outcomes of which are naturally interpretable
as ensembles of outcomes of the corresponding non-second quantized observable.
The frequency interpretation of probability is adopted, i.e. probability as the
average occurrence, from which Born's rule is deduced by enforcing the notion
of 'average' to such that are invariant under the second quantized unitary

congestion control as it may allow the design of a fair, stable, low loss, low
delay, and high utilization network. The Rate Control Protocol (RCP) is an
example of such a congestion control protocol. The current design of RCP
suggests that it should employ two forms of feedback; i.e. rate mismatch and
queue size, in order to manage its flow control algorithms. An outstanding
design question in RCP is whether the presence of queue size feedback is useful
or not, given feedback based on rate mismatch. In this paper, we address this
question using tools from control and bifurcation theory. We linearize the
actual non-linear system and analyze the local asymptotic stability, robust
stability and rate of convergence of both the design choices, i.e., with and
without queue size feedback. But such analyses do not offer clear design
recommendations on whether the queue feedback is useful or not. This motivates
a bifurcation-theoretic analysis where we have to take non-linear terms into
consideration, which helps to learn additional dynamical properties of the RCP
system. In particular, we proceed to analyze two non-linear properties, namely,
the type of Hopf bifurcation and the asymptotic stability of the bifurcating
limit cycles. Analytical results reveal that the presence of queue feedback in
RCP can induce a sub-critical Hopf bifurcation, which can lead to undesirable
system behavior. Whereas, in the absence of queue feedback, the Hopf
bifurcation is always super-critical where the bifurcating limit cycles are
stable and of small amplitude. The analysis is corroborated by numerical
computations and some packet-level simulations as well. Based on our work, the
suggestion for RCP is to only include feedback based on rate mismatch in the
design of the protocol.

gravity. We consider the coupling between the gravitational theory and
nonlinear electrodynamics. The coupling generates modifications in the
electromagnetic sector. This paper has as main objective generalize solutions
already known from general relativity to the $f(G)$ theory. To do that, we
first correct some misprints of the Odintsov and Nojiri's work in order to
introduce the formalism that will be used in the $f(G)$ gravity. In order to
satisfy all field equations, the method to find solutions in alternative
theories generates different $f(R)$ and $f(G)$ functions for each solution,
where only the nonlinear term of $f(G)$ contributes to the field equations. We
also analyze the energy conditions, since it is expected that some must be
violated to find regular black holes, and using an auxiliary field, we analyze
the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic theory.

variable-length CS codes, have been widely used in modern wireless
communication and data storage systems. Sequences encoded with constrained
sequence codes satisfy constraints imposed by the physical channel to enable
efficient and reliable transmission of coded symbols. In this paper, we propose
using deep learning approaches to decode fixed-length and variable-length CS
codes. Traditional encoding and decoding of fixed-length CS codes rely on
look-up tables (LUTs), which is prone to errors that occur during transmission.
We introduce fixed-length constrained sequence decoding based on multiple layer
perception (MLP) networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and
demonstrate that we are able to achieve low bit error rates that are close to
maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoding as well as improve the system
throughput. Further, implementation of capacity-achieving fixed-length codes,
where the complexity is prohibitively high with LUT decoding, becomes practical
with deep learning-based decoding. We then consider CNN-aided decoding of
variable-length CS codes. Different from conventional decoding where the
received sequence is processed bit-by-bit, we propose using CNNs to perform
one-shot batch-processing of variable-length CS codes such that an entire batch
is decoded at once, which improves the system throughput. Moreover, since the
CNNs can exploit global information with batch-processing instead of only
making use of local information as in conventional bit-by-bit processing, the
error rates can be reduced. We present simulation results that show excellent
performance with both fixed-length and variable-length CS codes that are used
in the frontiers of wireless communication systems.

\textrm{e.g.}, conservation of energy and momentum, are directly related to the
invariance of the action under a family of transformations. However, the
classical Noether theorem cannot be applied to study non-conservative systems
because it is not possible to formulate physically meaningful Lagrangian
functions for this kind of systems in the classical calculus of variation. On
the other hand, recently it was shown that an Action Principle with
action-dependent Lagrangian functions provides physically meaningful Lagrangian
functions for a huge variety of non-conservative systems (classical and
quantum). Consequently, the generalized Noether Theorem we present enable us to
investigate conservation laws of non-conservative systems. In order to
illustrate the potential of application, we consider three examples of
dissipative systems and we analyze the conservation laws related to spacetime

nearly 8.6% of the population in France is considered dysgraphic. Moreover,
research highlights the fundamental importance to detect and remediate these
handwriting difficulties as soon as possible as they may affect a child's
entire life, undermining performance and self-confidence in a wide variety of
school activities. At the moment, the detection of handwriting difficulties is
performed through a standard test called BHK. This detection, performed by
therapists, is laborious because of its high cost and subjectivity. We present
a digital approach to identify and characterize handwriting difficulties via a
Recurrent Neural Network model (RNN). The child under investigation is asked to
write on a graphics tablet all the letters of the alphabet as well as the ten
digits. Once complete, the RNN delivers a diagnosis in a few milliseconds and
demonstrates remarkable efficiency as it correctly identifies more than 90% of
children diagnosed as dysgraphic using the BHK test. The main advantage of our
tablet-based system is that it captures the dynamic features of writing --
something a human expert, such as a teacher, is unable to do. We show that
incorporating the dynamic information available by the use of tablet is highly
beneficial to our digital test to discriminate between typically-developing and
dysgraphic children.

light consistently in terms of particles, and Einstein's generalisation, lead
to the concept of Bosons as a class of quanta obeying `Bose-Einstein
statistics'. Their identity as a class came in sharp contrast when the Pauli
exclusion principle and the Dirac equation revealed the other class called
Fermions, obeying `Fermi-Dirac statistics'. Spin, and spin alone, is the
determining factor of the multiparticle behaviour of fundamental quanta. This
is the basis of the Spin-Statistics Connection. While it is known that the
overall theoretical picture is consistent, the physical reason for the
connection is unknown. Further, the class difference is sensitive only to the
total spin in a quantum aggregate, as spectacularly seen in superconductivity
and superfluidity, and in the Bose-Einstein condensation of neutral atomic gas.
Can we grasp the true reason behind the difference in the collective behaviour
of Bosons and Fermions? An explorer's journey demanding logical and physical
consistency of what we already know takes us to the hidden factors in the
relation between spin and the statistics of quanta. The surprising answer is in
the domain of gravity, that too, on a cosmic scale.

Previous approaches have attempted to address this problem by leveraging some

limitations of these approaches is that they do not consider the location
information of rain drops in the image. The proposed Uncertainty guided
Multi-scale Residual Learning (UMRL) network attempts to address this issue by
learning the rain content at different scales and using them to estimate the
final de-rained output. In addition, we introduce a technique which guides the
network to learn the network weights based on the confidence measure about the

on the notion of cycle spinning to improve the final de-raining performance.
