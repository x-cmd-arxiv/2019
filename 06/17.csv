content of data observed at scattered locations in a spatially extended domain
of arbitrary dimension. The method works by forming a Gaussian interpolant of
the input data, and then convolving the interpolant with a multiresolution
Gaussian approximation of the Green's function to a differential operator whose
spectrum can be tuned for problem-specific considerations. Like conventional
blurring algorithms, which the new algorithm generalizes to data measured at
locations other than a uniform grid, applications include deblurring and
separation of spatial scales. An example illustrates a possible application
toward enabling importance sampling approaches to data assimilation of
geophysical observations, which are often scattered over a spatial domain,
since blurring observations can make particle filters more effective at state
estimation of large scales. Another example, motivated by data analysis of
dynamics like ocean eddies that have strong separation of spatial scales, uses
the algorithm to decompose scattered oceanographic float measurements into
large-scale and small-scale components.

over a spline space built on a tensor product mesh. We construct the solution
over a smooth subspace of the residual. We can specify the solution subspace by
reducing the polynomial order, by increasing the continuity, or by a
combination of these. The Gramm matrix for the residual minimization method is
approximated by a weighted H1 norm, which we can express as Kronecker products,
due to the tensor-product structure of the approximations. We use the Gramm
matrix as a preconditional which can be applied in a computational cost
proportional to the number of degrees of freedom in 2D and 3D. Building on
these approximations, we construct an iterative algorithm. We test the residual
minimization method on several numerical examples, and we compare it to the
Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) and the Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin

magnetic impurity is screened at low energies by a non interacting metallic
bath. Here we consider a magnetic impurity coupled to a quantum wire with
pairing interaction which dynamically generates a mass gap. Using Bethe Ansatz
we solve the system exactly finding that it exhibits both screened and

(ANOVA) modeling aims to capture the relationship between a response and
covariates by decomposing the unknown function into various components,
representing main effects, two-way interactions, etc. Such an approach has been
pursued explicitly in smoothing spline ANOVA modeling and implicitly in various
greedy methods such as MARS. We develop a new method for functional ANOVA
modeling, based on doubly penalized estimation using total-variation and
empirical-norm penalties, to achieve sparse selection of component functions
and their knots. For this purpose, we formulate a new class of hierarchical
total variations, which measures total variations at different levels including
main effects and multi-way interactions, possibly after some order of
differentiation. Furthermore, we derive suitable basis functions for
multivariate splines such that the hierarchical total variation can be
represented as a regular Lasso penalty, and hence we extend a previous
backfitting algorithm to handle doubly penalized estimation for ANOVA modeling.
We present extensive numerical experiments on simulations and real data to
compare our method with existing methods including MARS, tree boosting, and
random forest. The results are very encouraging and demonstrate considerable
gains from our method in both prediction or classification accuracy and
simplicity of the fitted functions.

consider the thermal current across a nanowire for various strengths of surface
disorder. We use non-equilibrium Green's function techniques that allow us to
evaluate the thermal current beyond the linear response regime, for arbitrary

how the surface-roughness affects the frequency dependence of the thermal

experimentally observed differences between smooth vs rough surfaces. We argue
that a systematic study of the thermal current for different values of the

order linear time invariant systems in matrix form. Without reducing into first
order systems we show how the classical conditions for first order linear
systems can be generalized to this case. In term of Kalman type criterions
these concepts are investigated for second order discrete and continuous time
linear systems. It should be pointed out that by repeated differentiation of
state and output vector-functions we derive two different systems of linear
algebraic equations. Then the initial values x_0, x_1 and input functions can
be determined uniquely from these systems if and only if the observability and
controllability matrices have full rank, respectively. Also the transfer
function of the second order continuous-time linear state-space system is
constructed. A numerical example is given to illustrate the feasibility and
effectiveness of the theoretic results obtained.

non-smooth estimating equations with $U$-statistic structure. Jackknife
empirical likelihood (JEL) approach can solve this problem efficiently by
reducing the computation complexity of the empirical likelihood (EL) method.
However, as EL, JEL suffers the sensitivity problem to outliers. In this paper,
we propose a weighted jackknife empirical likelihood (WJEL) to tackle the above
limitation of JEL. The proposed WJEL tilts the JEL function by assigning
smaller weights to outliers. The asymptotic of the WJEL ratio statistic is
derived. It converges in distribution to a multiple of a chi-square random
variable. The multiplying constant depends on the weighting scheme. The
self-normalized version of WJEL ratio does not require to know the constant and
hence yields the standard chi-square distribution in the limit. Robustness of
the proposed method is illustrated by simulation studies and one real data
application.

ontologies to capture the given domain and thus improve automated information

accumulate knowledge over time on their own. This paper presents ConTrOn --
Continuously Trained Ontology -- a system that automatically augments
ontologies. ConTrOn tackles terminology problems by combining the knowledge
extracted from data sheets with an ontology created by domain experts and
external knowledge bases such as WordNet and Wikidata. To demonstrate how the

Results: Our study identified eight categories of advantages related to the
application of Use Cases. The most mentioned were estimation, analysis and
automation. These advantages had a heterogeneous distribution along the years.
On the other hand, the granularity of the scenarios described in the Use Cases,
the lack of a standardized format for specifying requirements, and the lack of
appropriate guidelines for analysing them were the most mentioned
disadvantages. We identified a variety of industry domains, grouped into seven
categories. As we can expect most of the papers report experiences in the
Information Technology domain, followed by financials applications. Almost half
the papers applied evaluation research, including an empirical validation. Only
one third of the analysed papers reported threats to validity, the most
mentioned being generalizability (38%). Conclusions: Use Cases have proven to
be a useful tool in software development, particularly during the early stages.
The positive effects far outweigh the few negative effects reported, although
this may be due to the researchers' tendency of not reporting negative results.

computation purposes in a blockchain system is proposed. In the introduced
system, the blockchain ledger is located at the communication nodes (CNs), and
the MMs associated with CNs process the blockchain's proof-of-work (PoW)
computation to verify the originality of the data. The MM that is the first to
finish its PoW will receive a reward by sending its computing result to the CNs
that are connected to other MMs. In the considered scenario, a blockchain
forking event occurs if the MM having the shortest PoW delay fails to be the
first to update its computing result to other MMs. To enable such mobile
operations for a blockchain with minimum forking events, it is imperative to
maintain low-latency wireless communications between MMs and CNs. To analyze
the sensitivity of the system to latency, the probability of occurrence of a
forking event is theoretically derived. The system is then designed so as to
compute the forked block's PoW again to recover from a forking event. For this
case, the average energy consumption of an MM is derived as a function of the
system parameters such as the number of MMs and power consumed by the
computing, transmission, and mobility processes of the MMs. Simulation results
verify the analytical derivations and show that using a larger number of MMs
can reduce the energy consumption by up to 94.5% compared to a blockchain
system with a single MM.

an interpolation parameter is changed, the pitches in one signal slide to the
pitches in the other, producing a portamento, or musical glide. The assignment

techniques that preserve the audio fidelity over this highly non-linear
transformation.
  A portamento is a natural way for a musician to transition between notes, but
traditionally it has only been possible for instruments with a continuously
variable pitch like the human voice or the violin. Audio transport extends the
portamento to any instrument, even polyphonic ones. Moreover, the effect can be
used to transition between different instruments, groups of instruments, or
really any transient-less audio signals. The audio transport effect operates in
real-time; we open-source implementation is provided. In experiments with
sinusoidal inputs, the interpolating effect is indistinguishable from ideal

learning tasks, there is a lack of theory to understand the way they work. In
particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known to perform much
better than Fully-Connected Networks (FCNs) on spatially structured data: the
architectural structure of CNNs benefits from prior knowledge on the features
of the data, for instance their translation invariance. The aim of this work is
to understand this fact through the lens of dynamics in the loss landscape.
  We introduce a method that maps a CNN to its equivalent FCN (denoted as
eFCN). Such an embedding enables the comparison of CNN and FCN training
dynamics directly in the FCN space. We use this method to test a new training
protocol, which consists in training a CNN, embedding it to FCN space at a
certain ``relax time'', then resuming the training in FCN space. We observe
that for all relax times, the deviation from the CNN subspace is small, and the
final performance reached by the eFCN is higher than that reachable by a
standard FCN of same architecture. More surprisingly, for some intermediate
relax times, the eFCN outperforms the CNN it stemmed, by combining the prior
information of the CNN and the expressivity of the FCN in a complementary way.
The practical interest of our protocol is limited by the very large size of the
highly sparse eFCN. However, it offers interesting insights into the
persistence of architectural bias under stochastic gradient dynamics. It shows
the existence of some rare basins in the FCN loss landscape associated with
very good generalization. These can only be accessed thanks to the CNN prior,
which helps navigate the landscape during the early stages of optimization.

natural stochastic textures. This paper is concerned with the property of
self-similarity in the statistical sense in the case of fully-textured images
that contain both stochastic texture and structural (mostly deterministic)
information. We firstly decompose a textured image into two layers
corresponding to its texture and structure, and show that the layer
representing the stochastic texture is characterized by random phase of uniform
distribution, unlike the phase of the structured information which is coherent.
The uniform distribution of the the random phase is verified by using a
suitable hypothesis testing framework. We proceed by proposing two approaches
to assessment of self-similarity. The first is based on patch-wise calculation
of the mutual information, while the second measures the mutual information
that exists across scales. Quantifying the extent of self-similarity by means
of mutual information is of paramount importance in the analysis of natural
stochastic textures that are encountered in medical imaging, geology,
agriculture and in computer vision algorithms that are designed for application
on fully-textures images.

manufacturing cost, and accelerates the growth of PV manufacturing. There are
two key questions about thin Si today: (a) how much can we still benefit
economically from thinning wafers? (b) what are the technological challenges to
transition to thin wafers? In this work, we re-evaluate the benefits and
challenges of thin Si for current and future PV modules using a comprehensive
techno-economic framework that couples device simulation, bottom-up cost
modeling, and a cash-flow growth model. When adopting an advanced technology
concept that features sufficiently good surface passivation, similarly high
efficiencies are achievable for 50-um wafers as for 160-um ones. We then
quantify the economic benefits for thin Si wafers in terms of poly-Si-to-module
manufacturing capex, module cost, and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for
utility PV systems. Particularly, LCOE favors thinner wafers for all
investigated device architectures, and can potentially be reduced by more than
5% from the value of 160-um wafers. With further improvements in module
efficiency, an advanced thin-wafer device concept with 50-um wafers could
reduce manufacturing capex by 48%, module cost by 28%, and LCOE by 24%.
Furthermore, we apply a sustainable growth model to investigate PV deployment
scenarios in 2030. It is found that the state-of-the-art industry concept could
not achieve the climate targets even with very aggressive financial scenarios,
therefore the capex reduction benefit of thin wafers is needed to facilitate
more rapid PV growth. Lastly, we discuss the remaining technological challenges
and areas for innovation to enable high-yield manufacturing of high-efficiency
PV modules with thin Si wafers.

enabling application building by centering usability in systems research in two
different ways: privileging the usability of the abstractions defined in

tractable approximations. We characterize a class of convex restrictions based

design sparsity patterns for transfer matrices Y(s) and X(s) such that any
corresponding controller K(s)=Y(s)X(s)^-1 exhibits the desired sparsity
pattern. For sparsity constraints, the approach of SI goes beyond the notion of
Quadratic Invariance (QI): 1) the SI approach always yields a convex
restriction; 2) the solution via the SI approach is guaranteed to be globally
optimal when QI holds and performs at least as well as considering a nearest QI
subset. Moreover, the notion of SI naturally applies to designing structured
static controllers, while QI is not utilizable. Numerical examples show that
even for non-QI cases, SI can recover solutions that are 1) globally optimal

release, plasma heating and particle acceleration in many astrophysical
environments. The last years witnessed a revival of interest in the MHD tearing
instability as a driver for efficient reconnection. It has been established
that, provided the current sheet aspect ratio becomes small enough ($a/L \sim
S^{-1/3}$ for a given Lundquist number $S\gg 1$), reconnection occurs on ideal
Alfv\'en timescales and becomes independent on $S$. Here we investigate, by
means of two-dimensional simulations, the \emph{ideal} tearing instability in
the Hall-MHD regime, which is appropriate when the width of the resistive layer
$\delta$ becomes comparable to the ion inertial length $d_i$. Moreover, we
study in detail the spontaneous development and reconnection of secondary
current sheets, which for high $S$ naturally adjust to the ideal aspect ratio
and hence their evolution proceeds very rapidly. For moderate low $S$, the
aspect ratio tends to the Sweet-Parker scaling ($a/L \sim S^{-1/2}$), in order
to fulfill the condition $\delta \ll a$ necessary for the onset of a tearing
instability. When the Hall term is included, the reconnection rate of this
secondary nonlinear phase is enhanced and, depending on the ratio $d_i/\delta$,
can be twice with respect to the pure MHD case, and up to ten times larger than
the linear phase. Therefore, the evolution of the tearing instability in thin
current sheets in the Hall-MHD regime naturally leads to an explosive
disruption of the reconnecting site and to energy release on super-Alfv\'enic
timescales, as required to explain astrophysical observations.

the last four centuries, their magnetic properties have been revealed and
documented only since the early 1900s. Sunspots typically appear in pairs of
opposite magnetic polarities which have a systematic orientation. This polarity
orientation is opposite across the equator -- a trend that has persisted over
the last century over which magnetic field observations exist. Taken together
with the configuration of the global poloidal field of the Sun -- that governs
the heliospheric open flux and cosmic ray flux at Earth -- this phenomenon is
consistent with the dipolar parity state of an underlying magnetohydrodynamic
dynamo. Although hemispheric asymmetry in the emergence of sunspots is observed
in the Sun, a parity shift has never been observed. We simulate hemispheric
asymmetry through the introduction of random fluctuations in a computational
dynamo model of the solar cycle and demonstrate that changes in parity are
indeed possible in long-term simulations covering thousands of years.
Quadrupolar modes are found to exist over a significant fraction of the
simulated time. In particular, we find that a parity shift in the underlying
nature of the sunspot cycle is more likely to occur when sunspot activity
dominates in any one hemisphere for a time which is significantly longer than
the cycle period. We establish causal pathways connecting hemispheric asymmetry
and cross-equatorial phase-shifts to parity flips in the underlying dynamo
mechanism. Our findings indicate that the solar cycle may have resided in
quadrupolar parity states in the distant past, and provides a possible pathway
for predicting parity flips in the future.

systems, including post-common-envelope binaries. A frequently proposed
explanation, apart from the possibility of having a third body, is the effect
of magnetic activity, which may alter the internal structure of the secondary
star, particularly its quadrupole moment, and thereby cause quasi-periodic
oscillations. Here we present two compressible non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamical
(MHD) simulations of the magnetic dynamo in a solar mass star, one of them with
three times the solar rotation rate (""slow rotator""), the other one with twenty
times the solar rotation rate (""rapid rotator""), to account for the high
rotational velocities in close binary systems. For the slow rotator, we find
that both the magnetic field and the stellar quadrupole moment change in a
quasi-periodic manner, leading to O-C (observed - corrected times of the
eclipse) variations of ~0.025 s. For the rapid rotator, the behavior of the
magnetic field as well as the quadrupole moment changes become considerably
more complex, due to the less coherent dynamo solution. The resulting O-C
variations are of the order 0.13 s. The observed system V471~Tau shows two
modes of eclipsing time variations, with amplitudes of 151 s and 20 s,
respectively. However, the current simulations may not capture all relevant
effects due to the neglect of the centrifugal force and self-gravity.
Considering the model limitations and that the rotation of V471 Tau is still a
factor of 2.5 faster than our rapid rotator, it may be conceivable to reach the
observed magnitudes.

the black hole's quasinormal modes (QNMs), leading to high-frequency
oscillations (""wiggles"") in the radiated field at $\mathcal{J}^+$, and in the
radiation-reaction self-force acting on the object after its orbit passes
through periapsis. Here we survey the phenomenology of these wiggles across a
range of black hole spins and equatorial orbits. In both the scalar-field and
gravitational cases we find that wiggles are a generic feature across a wide
range of parameter space, and that they are observable in field perturbations
at fixed spatial positions, in the self-force, and in radiated fields at
$\mathcal{J}^+$. For a given charge or mass of the small body, the QNM
excitations have the highest amplitudes for systems with a highly spinning
central black hole, a prograde orbit with high eccentricity, and an orbital
periapsis close to the light ring. The QNM amplitudes depend smoothly on the
orbital parameters, with only very small amplitude changes when the orbit's
(discrete) frequency spectrum is tuned to match QNM frequencies. The
association of wiggles with QNM excitations suggest that they represent a
situation where the \emph{nonlocal} nature of the self-force is particularly
apparent, with the wiggles arising as result of QNM excitation by the compact
object near periapsis, and then encountered later in the orbit.
Astrophysically, the effects of wiggles at $\mathcal{J}^+$ might allow direct
observation of Kerr QNMs in extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) binary black
hole systems, potentially enabling new tests of general relativity.

carriers at, ideally, the same electro-chemical potential as the other elements
in the parallel network. This can be thought of as voltage matching individual
parallel components and in intermediate band materials is intricately linked to
solar concentration and \'etendue mismatch between absorption and emission.
Generally, to achieve voltage matching under sub-optimal conditions, an
additional degree of freedom in the absorption thresholds of the material
through a carrier relaxation or ratchet step is required. We explain why the
ideal ratchet step decreases with solar concentration and how it depends on
radiative efficiency and emission \'etendue of the individual transitions. For
solar cell concepts that use Auger type carrier-carrier interactions or

predictor network. The selector network uses previously selected observations
to determine what should be observed in the future. The predictor network uses
the observations selected by the selector network to predict a label, providing
feedback to the selector network (well-selected variables should be predictive
of the label). The goal of the selector network is then to select variables
that balance the cost of observing the selected variables with their predictive
power; we wish to preserve the conditional label distribution. During training,
we use the actor-critic models to allow the loss of the selector to be
""back-propagated"" through the sampling process. The selector network ""acts"" by
selecting future observations to make. The predictor network acts as a ""critic""

analyze the impurity entropy, its spectral density, and the equilibrium
conductance for several values of the model parameters. Marked differences with
respect to the conventional one-channel spin $s=1/2$ Anderson model, that can
be traced as hallmarks of an impurity spin $S=1$, are found in the Kondo
temperature, the width and position of the charge transfer peak, as well as the
temperature dependence of the equilibrium conductance. Furthermore, we analyze
the rich effects of a single-ion magnetic anisotropy $D$ on the Kondo behavior.
In particular, as shown before, for large enough positive $D$ the system
behaves as a ""non-Landau"" Fermi liquid that cannot be adiabatically connected
to a non-interacting system turning off the interactions. For negative $D$ the
Kondo effect is strongly suppressed. The model studied is suitable for a
comprehensive analysis for recent investigations of a single Ni impurity
embedded into an Au chain.

CO(2-1) detected by VLA, we measured the CO Spectral Line Energy Distribution

The highly excited CO emission and hot dust temperature suggest that the

In each period, the agents choose how much to save (i.e., invest in a risk-free

endowments are fluctuating. We focus on a competitive stationary equilibrium
(CSE) in which the wealth distribution is invariant, the agents maximize their
expected discounted utility, and both the prices of consumption goods and the
interest rate are market-clearing. Our main contribution is to extend some
general equilibrium results to an incomplete-market Bewley-type economy with
many consumption goods. Under mild conditions on the agents' preferences, we
show that the aggregate demand for goods depends only on their relative prices
and that the aggregate demand for savings is homogeneous of degree in prices,
and we prove the existence of a CSE. When the agents' preferences can be
represented by a CES (constant elasticity of substitution) utility function
with an elasticity of substitution that is higher than or equal to one, we
prove that the CSE is unique. Under the same preferences, we show that a higher
inequality of endowments does not change the equilibrium prices of goods, and
decreases the equilibrium interest rate. Our results shed light on the impact
of market incompleteness on the properties of general equilibrium models.

spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for two pseudospin states (% \textit{i.e.,}
spin-1/2), which requires complex laser configurations and precise control of
laser parameters, thus has not been realized in experiment. Here we propose
that robust Wely points can be realized using 1D triple-well superlattices

tunnelings. The presence of the third band is responsible to the robustness of
the Weyl points against system parameters (e.g., Raman laser polarization,

optimization methods in machine learning has been proposed successively. The
systematic retrospect and summary of the optimization methods from the

non-trivial topology in alpha-Ce is driven by the f-d band inversion, which
arises from the formation of coherent 4f band around the Fermi level. We
captured the formation of the 4f quasi-particle band that is responsible for
the Lifshitz transition and the non-trivial Z2 topology establishment across

in a sense that it is controlled by available pressure (around 1 GPa) at room

maps the graph structure in the vicinity of v to a compact, fixed-dimensional
feature vector. This paper focuses on HNE for massive graphs, e.g., with
billions of edges. On this scale, most existing approaches fail, as they incur
either prohibitively high costs, or severely compromised result utility. Our
proposed solution, called Node-Reweighted PageRank (NRP), is based on a classic
idea of deriving embedding vectors from pairwise personalized PageRank (PPR)
values. Our contributions are twofold: first, we design a simple and efficient
baseline HNE method based on PPR that is capable of handling billion-edge
graphs on commodity hardware; second and more importantly, we identify an
inherent drawback of vanilla PPR, and address it in our main proposal NRP.
Specifically, PPR was designed for a very different purpose, i.e., ranking
nodes in G based on their relative importance from a source node's perspective.
In contrast, HNE aims to build node embeddings considering the whole graph.
Consequently, node embeddings derived directly from PPR are of suboptimal
utility. The proposed NRP approach overcomes the above deficiency through an
effective and efficient node reweighting algorithm, which augments PPR values
with node degree information, and iteratively adjusts embedding vectors
accordingly. Overall, NRP takes O(mlogn) time and O(m) space to compute all
node embeddings for a graph with m edges and n nodes. Our extensive experiments
that compare NRP against 18 existing solutions over 7 real graphs demonstrate
that NRP achieves higher result utility than all the solutions for link
prediction, graph reconstruction and node classification, while being up to
orders of magnitude faster. In particular, on a billion-edge Twitter graph, NRP
terminates within 4 hours, using a single CPU core.

  K-Theory","Preprint (submitted)",,,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the mid 1980s, while working on establishing completion theorems for
equivariant Algebraic K- Theory similar to the well-known Atiyah-Segal
completion theorem for equivariant topological K-theory, the late Robert
Thomason found the strong finiteness conditions that are required in such
theorems to be too restrictive. Then he made a conjecture on the existence of a
completion theorem in the sense of Atiyah and Segal for equivariant Algebraic
G-theory, for actions of linear algebraic groups on schemes that holds without
any of the strong finiteness conditions that are required in such theorems
proven by him, and also appearing in the original Atiyah-Segal theorem. The
main goal of the present paper is to provide a proof of this conjecture in as
broad a context as possible, making use of the technique of derived completion,
and to consider several of the applications.
  Our solution is broad enough to allow actions by all linear algebraic groups,
irrespective of whether they are connected or not, and acting on any
quasi-projective scheme of finite type over a field, irrespective of whether
they are regular or projective. This allows us therefore to consider the
Equivariant Algebraic G-Theory of large classes of varieties like all Toric
varieties (for the action of a torus) and all Spherical varieties (for the
action of a reductive group). Restricting to actions by split tori, we are also
able to consider actions on Algebraic Spaces. These enable us to obtain a wide
range of applications, some of which are briefly sketched and which we plan to
explore in detail in the future. A comparison of our results with previously
known results, none of which made use of derived completions, shows that
without the use of derived completions, one can only obtain results which are
indeed very restrictive.

when a suitable parametric model is difficult to find. The backfitting
algorithm is a powerful tool to estimate the additive components. However, due
to complexity of the estimators, the asymptotic $p$-value of the associated
test is difficult to calculate without a Monte Carlo simulation. Moreover, the
conventional tests assume that the predictor variables are strictly continuous.
In this paper, a new test is introduced for the additive components with
discrete or categorical predictors, where the model may contain continuous
covariates. This method is also applied to the semiparametric regression to
test the goodness-of-fit of the model. These tests are asymptotically optimal
in terms of the rate of convergence, as they can detect a specific class of
contiguous alternatives at a rate of $n^{-1/2}$. An extensive simulation study
is presented to support the theoretical results derived in this paper. Finally,
the method is applied to a real data to model the diamond price based on its
quality attributes and physical measurements.

efficiency, this paper proposes Latent Action Neural Architecture Search
(LaNAS), which learns actions to recursively partition the search space into
good or bad regions that contain networks with similar performance metrics.
During the search phase, as different action sequences lead to regions with
different performance, the search efficiency can be significantly improved by
biasing towards the good regions. On three NAS tasks, empirical results
demonstrate that LaNAS is at least an order more sample efficient than baseline
methods including evolutionary algorithms, Bayesian optimizations, and random
search. When applied in practice, both one-shot and regular LaNAS consistently
outperform existing results. Particularly, LaNAS achieves 99.0% accuracy on

ring) which is equipped with an action of the multiplicative monoid
$\mathcal{O}^\triangleright$ of non-zero elements of the ring of integers of a
$p$-adic field. Lubin-Tate formal groups also arise from this universal formal
group. If two $p$-adic fields have isomorphic multiplicative monoids
$\mathcal{O}^\triangleright$ then the additive structure of one arises from
that of the other by means of this universal formal group law (in a suitable
manner). In particular if two $p$-adic fields have isomorphic absolute Galois
groups then it is well-known that the two respective monoids
$\mathcal{O}^\triangleright$ are isomorphic and so this construction can be
applied to such $p$-adic fields. In this sense this universal formal group law
provides a single additive structure which binds together $p$-adic fields whose
absolute Galois groups are isomorphic (this anabelian variation of ring
structure is studied and used extensively by Shinichi Mochizuki). In particular
one obtains a universal (additive) expression for any non-zero $p$-adic integer
(in a given $p$-adic field) which is independent of the ring structure of the
$p$-adic field (this is also inspired by Mochizuki's results). These ideas
extend to geometric situations: for a smooth curve $X/K$ there is a universal
$K(X)^*$-formal group (here $K(X)^*$ is the monoid of non-zero meromorphic
functions on a smooth curve $X/K$ over a $p$-adic field $K$, which binds
together all the additive structures on $K(X)^*\cup \{0\}$ compatibly with the
universal additive structure on $K^*\cup\{0\}$ and hence a non-zero meromorphic
function on $X$ is given by a universal additive expression which is

be constrained in size for them to be considered interpretable. But smaller
models also tend to have high bias. This suggests a trade-off between
interpretability and accuracy. Our work addresses this by: (a) showing that
learning a training distribution (often different from the test distribution)
can often increase accuracy of small models, and therefore may be used as a
strategy to compensate for small sizes, and (b) providing a model-agnostic
algorithm to learn such training distributions. We pose the distribution
learning problem as one of optimizing parameters for an Infinite Beta Mixture
Model based on a Dirichlet Process, so that the held-out accuracy of a model
trained on a sample from this distribution is maximized. To make computation
tractable, we project the training data onto one dimension: prediction
uncertainty scores as provided by a highly accurate oracle model. A Bayesian
Optimizer is used for learning the parameters. Empirical results using multiple
real world datasets, various oracles and interpretable models with different
notions of model sizes, are presented. We observe significant relative
improvements in the F1-score in most cases, occasionally seeing improvements
greater than 100% over baselines. Additionally we show that the proposed
algorithm provides the following benefits: (a) its a framework which allows for
flexibility in implementation, (b) it can be used across feature spaces, e.g.,
the text classification accuracy of a Decision Tree using character n-grams is
shown to improve when using a Gated Recurrent Unit as an oracle, which uses a
sequence of characters as its input, (c) it can be used to train models that
have a non-differentiable training loss, e.g., Decision Trees, and (d)
reasonable defaults exist for most parameters of the algorithm, which makes it

computation (AirComp) over fading channels. Our objective is to minimize the
computation error by jointly optimizing the transmit power at the
power-constrained devices and a signal scaling factor (called denoising factor)
at the fusion center (FC). The problem is generally non-convex due to the
coupling of the transmit power over devices and denoising factor at the FC. To
tackle the challenge, we first consider the special case with static channels,
for which we derive the optimal solution in closed form. The optimal power
control exhibits a threshold-based structure. Specifically, for each device, if
the product of the channel quality and power budget, called quality indicator,
exceeds an optimized threshold, this device applies channel-inversion power
control; otherwise, it performs full power transmission. Building on the
results, we proceed to consider the general case with time-varying channels. To
solve the more challenging non-convex power control problem, we use the
Lagrange-duality method via exploiting its ""time-sharing"" property. The derived
optimal power control exhibits a regularized channel inversion structure, where
the regularization has the function of balancing the tradeoff between the
signal-magnitude alignment and noise suppression. Moreover, for the special
case with only one device being power limited, we show that the optimal power
control for the power-limited device has an interesting channel-inversion
water-filling structure, while those for other devices (with sufficient power
budgets) reduce to channel-inversion power control over all fading states.

representations. The ${\bf 16}$-plets contain Standard Model (SM) fermions plus
right-handed neutrinos, and the ${\bf 10}$-plet and the singlet fermions are
introduced to make the model anomaly-free. Gauge coupling unification at
$M_{GUT} \simeq 5 \times 10^{15}-10^{16}$ GeV is achieved by including an
intermediate Pati-Salam breaking at $M_{I} \simeq 10^{12}-10^{11}$ GeV, which
is a natural scale for the seesaw mechanism. For $M_{I} \simeq
10^{12}-10^{11}$, proton decay will be tested by the Hyper-Kamiokande
experiment. The extra fermions acquire their masses from $U(1)_\psi$ symmetry
breaking, and a $U(1)_\psi$ Higgs field drives a successful inflection-point
inflation with a low Hubble parameter during inflation, $H_{inf} \ll M_{I}$.
Hence, cosmologically dangerous monopoles produced from $SO(10)$ and PS
breakings are diluted away. The reheating temperature after inflation can be
high enough for successful leptogenesis. With the Higgs field contents of our
model, a ${\bf Z}_2$ symmetry remains unbroken after GUT symmetry breaking, and
the lightest mass eigenstate among linear combinations of the ${\bf 10}$-plet

the parameter regions to reproduce the observed DM relic density while
satisfying the current constraint from the direct DM detection experiments. The
present allowed region will be fully covered by the future direct detection
experiments such as LUX-ZEPLIN DM experiment. In the presence of the extra

Activation of the encoded features is used for the binary classification. The
output of one branch of the decoder is used for segmenting the manipulated

noisy images. However, for an unseen corrupted image, both supervised

statistics, or both. That is, the networks learned from external images
inherently suffer from a domain gap problem: the image priors and noise
statistics are very different between the training and test images. This
problem becomes more clear when dealing with the signal dependent realistic
noise. To circumvent this problem, in this work, we propose a novel
""Noisy-As-Clean"" (NAC) strategy of training self-supervised denoising networks.
Specifically, the corrupted test image is directly taken as the ""clean"" target,
while the inputs are synthetic images consisted of this corrupted image and a
second and similar corruption. A simple but useful observation on our NAC is:
as long as the noise is weak, it is feasible to learn a self-supervised network
only with the corrupted image, approximating the optimal parameters of a
supervised network learned with pairs of noisy and clean images. Experiments on
synthetic and realistic noise removal demonstrate that, the DnCNN and ResNet
networks trained with our self-supervised NAC strategy achieve comparable or

fluxes has become a well known integrable model, however a putative dual field
theory description remains incomplete. We study the anomalous dimensions of
twist operators in this theory via semiclassical string methods. We describe
the construction of a multi-cusp closed string in conformal gauge moving in
$AdS_3$ with fluxes, which supposedly is dual to a general higher twist
operator. After analyzing the string profiles and conserved charges for the
string, we find the exact dispersion relation between the charges in the `long'
string limit. This dispersion relation in leading order turns out to be similar
to the case of pure RR flux, with the coupling being scaled by a factor that
depends on the amount of NS-NS flux turned on. We also analyse the case of pure
NS flux, where the dispersion relation simplifies considerably. Furthermore, we
discuss the implications of these results at length.

nanoparticles near a phase transition or non-crystalizing objects such as large
proteins and viruses is currently the most elegant method for characterizing
their structure. Using hard X-ray radiation provides scattering images that
encode two-dimensional projections, which can be combined to identify the full
three-dimensional object structure from multiple identical samples. Wide-angle
scattering using XUV or soft X-rays, despite yielding lower resolution,
provides three-dimensional structural information in a single shot and has
opened routes towards the characterization of non-reproducible objects in the
gas phase. The retrieval of the structural information contained in wide-angle
scattering images is highly non-trivial, and currently no efficient rigorous
algorithm is known. Here we show that deep learning networks, trained with
simulated scattering data, allow for fast and accurate reconstruction of shape
and orientation of nanoparticles from experimental images. The gain in speed
compared to conventional retrieval techniques opens the route for automated

pre-identification of nanostructures in scattering experiments with high

The molecular gas in the central region (1"" ~73pc) shows several CO clumps with
complex kinematics which appears to be dominated by non-circular motions. While
we cannot demonstrate conclusively the presence of a warped nuclear disk, we
also detected non-circular motions along the kinematic minor axis. They reach
line-of-sight velocities of v-vsys =150-200km/s. Assuming that the radial
motions are in the plane of the galaxy, then we interpret them as a nuclear
molecular outflow due to molecular gas in the host galaxy being entrained by
the AGN wind. We derive molecular outflow rates of $5\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$
and $0.6\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ at projected distances of up to 30pc to the
northeast and southwest of the AGN, respectively. At the AGN location we

simple heuristic strategies such as $\epsilon$-greedy exploration or adding
Gaussian noise to actions. These heuristics, however, are unable to
intelligently distinguish the well explored and the unexplored regions of state
space, which can lead to inefficient use of training time. We introduce
entropy-based exploration (EBE) that enables an agent to explore efficiently
the unexplored regions of state space. EBE quantifies the agent's learning in a
state using merely state-dependent action values and adaptively explores the
state space, i.e. more exploration for the unexplored region of the state
space. We perform experiments on a diverse set of environments and demonstrate
that EBE enables efficient exploration that ultimately results in faster

takes multiple self attention steps to gather correspondences or uses image

only take advantage of semantic information without considering that objects'
relative position also contributes to image understanding. To this end, we
introduce a novel position-aware relation module to model both the semantic and
spatial relationship simultaneously for image-text matching in this paper.
Given an image, our method utilizes the location of different objects to
capture spatial relationship innovatively. With the combination of semantic and
spatial relationship, it's easier to understand the content of different
modalities (images and sentences) and capture fine-grained latent
correspondences of image-text pairs. Besides, we employ a two-step aggregated
relation module to capture interpretable alignment of image-text pairs. The
first step, we call it intra-modal relation mechanism, in which we computes
responses between different objects in an image or different words in a
sentence separately; The second step, we call it inter-modal relation
mechanism, in which the query plays a role of textual context to refine the
relationship among object proposals in an image. In this way, our
position-aware aggregated relation network (ParNet) not only knows which
entities are relevant by attending on different objects (words) adaptively, but
also adjust the inter-modal correspondence according to the latent alignments
according to query's content. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art

that are not available in conventional passive systems. Structural rotation has
been widely employed to achieve non-reciprocity or time-reversal symmetry
breaking. Here, we examine the quasi-normal modes and scattering properties of
a two-dimensional cylindrical cavity under rotation. In addition to the
familiar phenomenon of Sagnac frequency shift, we observe the the hybridization
of the clockwise(CW) and counter-clockwise(CCW) chiral modes of the cavity
controlled by the rotation. The rotation tends to suppress one chiral mode
while amplify the other, and it leads to the variation of the far field. The
phenomenon can be understood as the result of a synthetic gauge field induced
by the rotation of the cylinder. We explicitly derived this gauge field and the
resulting Sagnac frequency shift. The analytical results are corroborated by
finite element simulations. Our results can be applied in the measurement of
rotating devices by probing the far field.

Optical and near-IR observations of jet-driving sources are often hindered by
the presence of a natal envelope. Jets around partly embedded sources are a
useful diagnostic to constrain the geometry of the concealed protoplanetary
disk. In fact, the jet-driving mechanisms are affected by both spatial
anisotropies and episodic variations at the (sub-)au scale from the star. We
obtained a rich set of high-contrast VLT/SPHERE observations from 0.6 micron to
2.2 micron of the young intermediate-mass star RY Tau. Given the proximity to
the Sun of this source, our images have the highest spatial resolution ever
obtained for an atomic jet. Optical observations in polarized light show no
sign of the protoplanetary disk detected by ALMA. Instead, we observed a
diffuse signal resembling a remnant envelope with an outflow cavity. The jet is
detected in four spectral lines. The jet appears to be wiggling and its radial
width increasing with the distance is complementary to the shape of the outflow
cavity suggesting a strong jet/envelope interaction. Through the estimated
tangential velocity, we revealed a possible connection between the launching
time of the jet sub-structures and the stellar activity of RY Tau. RY Tau is at
an intermediate stage toward the dispersal of the natal envelope. This source
shows episodic increases of mass accretion/ejection similarly to other known
intermediate-mass stars. The amount of observed jet wiggle is consistent with
the presence of a precessing disk warp or misaligned inner disk that would be
induced by an unseen planetary/sub-stellar companion at sub-/few-au scales. The
high disk mass of RY Tau and of two other jet-driving intermediate-mass stars,
HD163296 and MWC480, suggests that massive, full disks are more efficient at
launching prominent jets.

provides a universal method for Variational Inference, but taking advantage of
special properties of the approximation family or of the target can improve the
convergence speed significantly. For example, if the approximation family is a
transformation family, such as a Gaussian, then switching to the
reparameterization gradient (Kingma and Welling (2014)) often yields a major
reduction in gradient variance. Ultimately, reducing the variance can reduce
the computational cost and yield better approximations.
  We present a new method to extend the reparameterization trick to more
general exponential families including the Wishart, Gamma, and Student
distributions. Variational Inference with Numerical Derivatives (VIND)
approximates the gradient with numerical derivatives and reduces its variance
using a tight coupling of the approximation family. The resulting algorithm is
simple to implement and can profit from widely known couplings. Our experiments
confirm that VIND effectively decreases the gradient variance and therefore
improves the posterior approximation in relevant cases. It thus provides an
efficient yet simple Variational Inference method for computing non-Gaussian
approximations.

generate adversarial perturbations without access to the target models to
compute gradients. Previous methods tried to approximate the gradient either by
using a transfer gradient of a surrogate white-box model, or based on the query
feedback. However, these methods often suffer from low attack success rates or
poor query efficiency since it is non-trivial to estimate the gradient in a
high-dimensional space with limited information. To address these problems, we
propose a prior-guided random gradient-free (P-RGF) method to improve black-box
adversarial attacks, which takes the advantage of a transfer-based prior and
the query information simultaneously. The transfer-based prior given by the
gradient of a surrogate model is appropriately integrated into our algorithm by
an optimal coefficient derived by a theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method requires much fewer queries to attack black-box

the crucial role of Re and O3 atoms in the structural and mechanical properties
of this material. Analysis of Born effective charge (BEC) along with gamma
point phonon frequencies through density functional perturbation approach
(DFPT) have also shown the importance of these atoms. The anisotropic nature of
BEC is mainly found to be contributed due to O3 atoms. An asymmetric stretching
of Re-O3 bond is found to be mainly responsible for high intense IR peak in the
high-frequency range whereas the second most intense peak is due to the
symmetric stretching of these bonds along with the asymmetric stretching of the
Re-O2 bond. To get exact electronic band structure, spin orbit coupling (SOC)
in addition to Tran-Blaha Modified Becke-Johnson (TB-mBJ) potential have been
considered. Inclusion of SOC clearly shows a decreased band gap of 4.71 eV from
TB-mBJ implemented band gap 4.82 eV which mainly attributed to 0.08 eV
splitting of Re d-states. Study of density of states (DOS) reveals that
conduction band bottom (CBB) is mainly made up of Re d-states but main
contribution to valence band top (VBT) is due to oxygen p-states. The bonding

reduces the overall mechanical inertia available in power grids and accordingly
raises a number of issues of grid stability over short to medium time scales.
It has been suggested that this reduction of overall inertia can be compensated
to some extent by the deployment of substitution inertia - synthetic inertia,
flywheels or synchronous condensers. Of particular importance is to optimize
the placement of the limited available substitution inertia, to mitigate
voltage angle and frequency disturbances following a fault such as an abrupt
power loss. Performance measures in the form of H2-norms have been recently
introduced to evaluate the overall magnitude of such disturbances on an
electric power grid. However, despite the mathematical conveniance of these
measures, analytical results can be obtained only under rather restrictive
assumptions of uniform damping ratio, or homogeneous distribution of inertia
and/or primary control in the system. Here, we introduce matrix perturbation
theory to obtain analytical results for optimal inertia and primary control
placement where both are heterogeneous. Armed with that efficient tool, we
construct two simple algorithms that independently determine the optimal
geographical distribution of inertia and primary control. These algorithms are
then implemented on a model of the synchronous transmission grid of continental
Europe. We find that the optimal distribution of inertia is geographically
homogeneous but that primary control should be mainly located on the slow modes
of the network, where the intrinsic grid dynamics takes more time to damp
frequency disturbances.

geometric structures of data to approximate the Pareto front of multi-objective

sampling strategies. The inductive skeleton fitting employs a stratified
subsampling from each skeleton of a simplex, whereas the all-at-once fitting
uses a non-stratified sampling which treats a simplex as a whole. In this
paper, we analyze the asymptotic risks of those B\'ezier simplex fitting
methods and derive the optimal subsample ratio for the inductive skeleton

has a smaller risk when the degree of a Bezier simplex is less than three.
Those results are verified numerically under small to moderate sample sizes. In

generalized location problem and a multi-objective hyper-parameter tuning of

finding desired accelerations to control its position, and controlling its

angle reference. While the thrust vector, generating accelerations, and the
angle of rotation about the thrust vector, determining the yaw angle, can be
controlled independently, most attitude control strategies in the literature,
relying on representations in terms of quaternions, rotation matrices or Euler
angles, result in an unnecessary coupling between the control of the thrust

undesired position tracking errors due to yaw tracking errors. In this paper we
propose to tackle the attitude control problem using an attitude representation

inertial-cascade regime. Here, the power spectrum is anisotropic and dominated
by compressive modes, with intermittency that can reach kurtosis values of up

single-molecule spintronics experiments. Likewise, a relaxation down to the
most stable geometry is a critical step in theoretical simulations of transport
through single-molecule junctions. Herein we present a set of calculations
designed to analyze and compare the effect of different anchoring points and
the effect of perturbations in the molecular geometry and interelectrode
distance. As model system we chose the [V($\alpha$-C$_3$S$_5$)$_3$]$^{2-}$
complex connecting two Au(111) electrodes in a slightly compressed geometry. In
our calculations, the attachment happens through an S-Au bond, a common
anchoring strategy in molecular spintronics experiments. Our results confirm
that small alterations in the molecular geometry have important effects in the
conductance. We were able to compare these effects with the ones arising from
changing the anchoring position with a constant molecular geometry.
Unexpectedly, we demonstrate that the anchoring position has only a lesser
relevance in the spintronic behavior of the device, as long as all other
parameters are kept frozen. As a consequence, we predict that for
experimentalists aiming for reproducibility, the molecular design of rigid
linkers is more relevant than the design of univocal anchoring positions.

found not always to reverse its zonal wind direction, but only manifests itself
as a deceleration of the dominant wind at certain pressure levels and
latitudes. Singular System Analysis (SSA) is further applied on the zonal-mean
zonal wind in different latitude bands to reveal the characteristics of SAO

with the observed oscillations of zonal-mean zonal wind, and supplies the
majority of the westward (retrograde) forcing in the SAO cycle. The forcing due
to various non-zonal waves supplies forcing to the zonal-mean zonal wind that
is nearly the opposite of the forcing due to meridional advection above ~3 Pa

Carnot-analog cycles are constructed and solved, operating irreversibly at

frictionless unitary shortcuts. The working medium in this study is composed of
a particle in a driven harmonic trap. For this system, we solve the dynamics
employing a generalized canonical state. Such a description incorporates both
changes in energy and coherence. This allows comparing three types of
Carnot-analog cycles, Carnot-shortcut, Endo-shortcut and Endo-global. The
Carnot-shortcut engine demonstrates the trade-off between power and efficiency.
It posses a maximum in power, a minimum cycle time where it becomes a
dissipator and for a diverging cycle time approaches the ideal Carnot
efficiency. The irreversibility of the cycle arises from non-adiabatic driving,
which generates coherence. To study the role of coherence we compare the
performance of the shortcut cycles, where coherence is limited to the interior
of the strokes, with the Endo-global cycle where the coherence never vanishes.
The Endo-global engine exhibits a quantum signature at a short cycle-time,
manifested by a positive power output while the shortcut cycles become
dissipators. If energy is monitored the back action of the measurement causes
dephasing and the power terminates.

planetesimals. Here we address the question of what is the best way to measure
the location of outer planetesimal belts that encompass extrasolar planetary
systems. A standard method is using resolved images at mm-wavelengths, which
reveal dust grains with sizes comparable to the observational wavelength.
Smaller grains seen in the infrared (IR) are subject to several
non-gravitational forces that drag them away from their birth rings, and so may
not closely trace the parent bodies. In this study, we examine whether imaging
of debris discs at shorter wavelengths might enable determining the spatial
location of the exo-Kuiper belts with sufficient accuracy. We find that around
M-type stars the dust best visible in the mid-IR is efficiently displaced
inward from their birth location by stellar winds, causing the discs to look
more compact in mid-IR images than they actually are. However, around
earlier-type stars where the majority of debris discs is found, discs are still
the brightest at the birth ring location in the mid-IR regime. Thus, sensitive
IR facilities with good angular resolution, such as MIRI on JWST, will enable
tracing exo-Kuiper belts in nearby debris disc systems.

metrics and also to introduce operator-valued kernels, which enables us to
handle randomness in systems. Our metric provides an extension of the existing
metrics for deterministic systems, and gives a specification of the kernel
maximal mean discrepancy of random processes. Moreover, by considering the
time-wise independence of random processes, we clarify a connection between our
metric and the independence criteria with kernels such as Hilbert-Schmidt
independence criteria. We empirically illustrate our metric with synthetic
data, and evaluate it in the context of the independence test for random

the distribution of nearest-neighbor energy level spacing. We also study the
effects of molecular properties, such as interaction strength, interaction

Furthermore, they ask whether the enumeration is governed by the topological

breakthrough of CNNs stronger features are available for tasks like
classification but not specifically for the requirements of semantic matching.
In the following we present a weakly supervised metric learning approach which
generates stronger features by encoding far more context than previous methods.
First, we generate more suitable training data using a geometrically informed
correspondence mining method which is less prone to spurious matches and
requires only image category labels as supervision. Second, we introduce a new
convolutional layer which is a learned mixture of differently strided
convolutions and allows the network to encode implicitly more context while
preserving matching accuracy at the same time. The strong geometric encoding on
the feature side enables us to learn a semantic flow network, which generates
more natural deformations than parametric transformation based models and is
able to jointly predict foreground regions at the same time. Our semantic flow
network outperforms current state-of-the-art on several semantic matching
benchmarks and the learned features show astonishing performance regarding
simple nearest neighbor matching.

  derivations and interpretations. Added Appendix to clarify interpretation of
  scale in a common way between discrete and continuous probability
  distributions",,,,"q-bio.PE cond-mat.stat-mech","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The abundance of different species in a community often follows the log
series distribution. Other ecological patterns also have simple forms. Why does
the complexity and variability of ecological systems reduce to such simplicity?
Common answers include maximum entropy, neutrality, and convergent outcome from
different underlying biological processes. This article proposes a more general
answer based on the concept of invariance, the property by which a pattern
remains the same after transformation. Invariance has a long tradition in
physics. For example, general relativity emphasizes the need for the equations
describing the laws of physics to have the same form in all frames of
reference. By bringing this unifying invariance approach into ecology, we show
that the log series pattern dominates when the consequences of processes acting
on abundance are invariant to the addition or multiplication of abundance by a
constant. The lognormal pattern dominates when the processes acting on net
species growth rate obey rotational invariance (symmetry) with respect to the
summing up of the individual component processes. Recognizing how these
invariances connect pattern to process leads to a synthesis of previous
approaches. First, invariance provides a simpler and more fundamental maximum
entropy derivation of the log series distribution. Second, invariance provides
a simple derivation of the key result from neutral theory: the log series at
the metacommunity scale and a clearer form of the skewed lognormal at the local
community scale. The invariance expressions are easy to understand because they
uniquely describe the basic underlying components that shape pattern.

dislocation distribution in deformed single crystal copper micropillars.
Identical micropillars (6 um x 6 um x 18 um in size) were fabricated by focused
ion beam (FIB) and compressed at room temperature. The deformation process was
stopped at different strain levels (~1%, 4% and 10%) to study the evolution of
geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs). Serial slicing with FIB and
consecutive HR-EBSD mapping on the (100) side was used to create and compare
3-dimensional maps of the deformed volumes. Average GND densities were
calculated for each deformation step. Total dislocation density calculation
based on X-ray synchrotron measurements were conducted on the $4\%$ pillar to
compare dislocation densities determined by the two complementary methods.
Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images were captured on the 10% pillar to visualize the actual
dislocation structure. With the 3D HR-EBSD technique we have studied the
geometrically necessary dislocations evolving during the deformation of
micropillars. An intermediate behaviour was found at the studied sample size
between bulk and nanoscale plasticity: A well-developed dislocation cell
structure built up upon deformation but with significantly lower GND density
than in bulk. This explains the simultaneous observation of strain hardening

indicative of a accretion shock height of $\sim$ 75 km. No significant X-ray
QPOs are detected with an amplitude upper limit of $\sim$30\% in the range

expected frequencies from radiative instability are identical for X-rays and

demonstrated using self-consistent analysis of spin-based non-equilibrium

Landau-Khalatnikov (LK) equation to model the ferroelectric polarization
dynamics, together with landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert's (LLG) equations to capture
the magnetization dynamics. The spin-based NEGF method is equipped with a
magnetization dependent Hamiltonian that eases the modeling of the tunneling
electro-resistance (TER), tunneling magneto-resistance (TMR), and the
magnetoelectric effect (ME) in MFTJs. Moreover, we apply the first principle
calculations to estimate the screening lengths of the MFTJ electrodes that are
necessary for estimation of tunneling current. The simulation results of the
proposed framework are in good agreement with the experimental results.
Finally, a comprehensive analysis of TER and TMR of MFTJs and their dependence

distribution of the Orion OB association, based on the second data release of
the Gaia satellite (Gaia DR2). Our goal is to obtain a complete picture of the
star formation history of the Orion complex and to relate our findings to
theories of sequential and triggered star formation. We select the Orion
population with simple photometric criteria, and we construct a three
dimensional map in galactic Cartesian coordinates to study the physical
arrangement of the stellar clusters in the Orion region. The map shows
structures that extend for roughly $150 \, \mathrm{pc}$ along the line of
sight, divided in multiple sub-clusters. We separate different groups by using
the density based clustering algorithm DBSCAN. We study the kinematic
properties of all the groups found by DBSCAN first by inspecting their proper
motion distribution, and then by applying a kinematic modelling code based on
an iterative maximum likelihood approach, which we use to derive their mean
velocity, velocity dispersion and isotropic expansion. By using an isochrone
fitting procedure we provide ages and extinction values for all the groups. We
confirm the presence of an old population ($\sim 15$ Myr) towards the 25 Ori
region, and we find that groups with ages of $12-15 \, \mathrm{Myr}$ are
present also towards the Belt region. We notice the presence of a population of
$\sim 10$ Myr also in front of the Orion A molecular cloud. Our findings
suggest that star formation in Orion does not follow a simple sequential
scenario, but instead consists of multiple events, which caused kinematic and
physical sub-structure. To fully explain the detailed sequence of events,
specific simulations and further radial velocity data are needed.

calculation of the resonant states in open optical systems with frequency

nanoparticles and semiconductor microspheres. The material permittivity is
determined by fitting the measured indices of refraction and absorption with a
generalized Drude-Lorentz model containing a number of poles in the complex
frequency plane. Each Drude or Lorentz pole generates an infinite series of
resonant states. Furthermore, for small nanoparticles, each of these poles
produces a distinct surface plasmon polariton mode. The evolution of these
multiple surface modes with increasing radius traces the transition from the
electrostatic limit to significant retardation and radiation. Treating the
optical phonon range in a semiconductor microsphere, a reststrahlen band
separating the resonant states is found. Considering a small energy range
around the semiconductor band gap, the transition from absorption to gain is
described by inverting the Lorentz pole weight, which results in the formation
of lasing resonant states. Interestingly, the series of resonant states
converging towards the absorption pole from the lower frequency side reshapes
for a gain pole into a clockwise loop approaching the pole from the higher
frequency side, being separated from a series spanning from low to high
frequencies and containing the lasing modes.

systematic effects, which must be under control, representing one of the most
critical part in the design of a B-Modes experiment. In this paper we present,
simulate and analyse the spurious signal arising from the precession of a
rotating HWP. We first find an analytical formula for the impact of the
systematic effect induced by the HWP precession on the propagating radiation,
using the 3D generalization of the Muller formalism. We then perform several
numerical simulations, showing the effect induced on the Stokes parameters by
this systematic. We also derive and discuss the impact into B-modes measured by
a satellite experiment. We find the analytical formula for the Stokes

assuming to observe all the sky with a satellite mission, we analyze the effect
on B-modes measurements. The effect is not negligible giving the current

the scaling dimension of the quenched operator as $\delta\lambda\cdot\delta

represent the semantic map as a geometrical mesh and a semantic texture coupled

geometry can be greatly simplified without loosing fidelity, while semantic
information can be stored at a higher resolution, independent of the mesh. We
construct a mesh from depth sensors to represent the scene geometry and fuse
information into the semantic texture from segmentations of individual RGB
views of the scene. Making the semantics persistent in a global mesh enables us
to enforce temporal and spatial consistency of the individual view predictions.
For this, we propose an efficient method of establishing consensus between
individual segmentations by iteratively retraining semantic segmentation with
the information stored within the map and using the retrained segmentation to
re-fuse the semantics. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our
approach by reconstructing semantic maps of scenes from NYUv2 and a scene

distortions due to the motion of the galaxies which contain the {\rm HI} as

modelling is essential if this signal is to be used for precision cosmology.
Considering dark matter only simulations where the {\rm HI} is assumed to
reside in galaxies which are associated with haloes, in this work we introduce
a technique to incorporate the {\rm HI} motions within the galaxies. This is
achieved through a line profile which accounts for both the rotational and
random (thermal and turbulent) motions of the {\rm HI} within galaxies. The
functional form of the double horned line profiles used here is motivated by
observations of $z=0$ spiral galaxies. Analyzing the simulated 21-cm power
spectrum over the redshift range $1 \le z \le 6$ we find that the {\rm HI}
motions within galaxies makes a significant contribution that is manifested as
an enhancement in the Finger of God (FoG) effect which can be modelled
reasonably well through a Lorentzian damping profile with a single free
parameter $\sigma_p$. The value of $\sigma_p$ is significantly enhanced if
motions within the galaxies are included. This is particularly important at
$z>3$ where $\sigma_p$ is dominated by the internal motions and a measurement
of the FoG effect here could provide a handle on the line profiles of high

This, so-called negative mode problem in quantum tunneling with gravity, was
discovered 34 years ago and in spite of the fact that in these years many
different groups worked on this topic, it has still not been resolved. Here, we
briefly summarize the current status of the problem and investigate properties
of the bounces, numerically and analytically for physically interesting
potentials. In the framework of the Hamiltonian approach we show that for
generic polynomial potentials the negative mode problem could arise at energies
much lower than the Planck mass, indicating that the negative mode problem is
not related to physics at the Planck scale. At the same time we find that for a
Higgs like potential, as it appears in the standard model, the problem does not
appear at realistic values of the potential's parameters but only at the Planck
scale.

the sodium doublet in transmission spectra measured at low (HAT-P-1b,
HAT-P-12b, HD 189733b, WASP-6b, WASP-17b and WASP-39b) and high (WASP-49b)

optical/visible transmission spectra are unable to break the normalization
degeneracy if the spectral continuum is associated with Rayleigh scattering by
small cloud particles. Using mock retrievals, we demonstrate that un-normalized
ground-based, high-resolution spectra centered on the sodium doublet alone are
unable to precisely inform us about the pressure levels probed by the transit
chord and hence to identify the region (i.e., thermosphere, exosphere) of the
atmosphere being probed. Retrievals performed on the HARPS transmission
spectrum of WASP-49b support this conclusion. Generally, we are unable to
distinguish between LTE versus NLTE interpretations of the sodium doublet based
on the computed Bayesian evidence with the implication that LTE interpretations
tend to under-estimate the temperature probed by the transit chord. With the
current low-resolution data, the sodium line shapes are consistent with Voigt

low-latency access to services at the network edge. The services are hosted at
various types of edge nodes with both computation and communication
capabilities. Due to the heterogeneity of edge node characteristics and user
locations, the performance of MEC varies depending on where the service is
hosted. In this paper, we consider such a heterogeneous MEC system, and focus
on the problem of placing multiple services in the system to maximize the total
reward. We show that the problem is NP-hard via reduction from the set cover
problem, and propose a deterministic approximation algorithm to solve the
problem, which has an approximation ratio that is not worse than
$\left(1-e^{-1}\right)/4$. The proposed algorithm is based on two sub-routines
that are suitable for small and arbitrarily sized services, respectively. The
algorithm is designed using a novel way of partitioning each edge node into
multiple slots, where each slot contains one service. The approximation
guarantee is obtained via a specialization of the method of conditional

through a reflection function that can capture a wide range of cases from

reconstructed using the Reconstruction of Attosecond Beating By Interference of

first attosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy measurements
performed at 100 kHz repetition rate and the first attosecond experiments
performed at ELI-ALPS. These RABBIT measurements were taken with an additional
IR field temporally locked to the extreme-ultraviolet APT, resulting in an
atypical omega beating. We show that the phase of the 2-omega beating recorded
under these conditions is strictly identical to that observed in standard
RABBIT measurements within second-order perturbation theory. This work

is known that the decay follows a power law, with an interaction dependent
exponent, which, for repulsive interactions, is larger than the noninteracting
value $-1$. We first investigate if this behavior can be captured by many-body
perturbation theory for either the Green function or the self-energy in lowest

a logarithmic divergence indicative of the power law. One might hope that the
resummation of higher order terms inherent to the Dyson equation then leads to
a power law in the perturbation theory for the self-energy. However, the
numerical results do not support this. Next we use density functional theory
within the local-density approximation and an exchange-correlation functional
derived from the exact Bethe ansatz solution of the translational invariant

Consistently with our earlier findings from a smaller sample, we find no strong
relation between the minihalo radio luminosity and the total cluster mass.
Instead, we find a strong positive correlation between the minihalo radio power
and X-ray bolometric luminosity of the cool core (r<70 kpc). This supplements
our earlier result that most if not all cool cores in massive clusters contain
a minihalo. Comparison of radio and Chandra X-ray images indicates that the
minihalo emission is typically confined by concentric sloshing cold fronts in
the cores of most of our clusters, supporting the hypothesis that minihalos
arise from electron reacceleration by turbulence caused by core gas sloshing.
Taken together, our findings suggest that the origin of minihalos should be
closely related to the properties of thermal plasma in cluster cool cores.

functionalized twisted van der Waals heterostructures, long-range modulations
of the spin physics can be engineered. Here we show that such superlattice
modulations in a many-body spin Hamiltonian can give rise to observable
topological boundary modes in the excitation spectrum of the spin chain. In the
case of an XY spin-$1/2$ chain, these boundary modes stem from a mathematical
correspondence with the chiral edge modes of a two-dimensional quantum Hall

close some of the topological gaps in the excitation spectrum, and the
topological boundary modes visibly persist in the isotropic Heisenberg limit.

approach for a class of rough fractional stochastic volatility models. These
models are increasingly popular between academics and practitioners due to
their surprising consistency with financial markets. However, they bring
several challenges alongside. Most noticeably, even simple non-linear financial
derivatives as vanilla European options are typically priced by means of
Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations which are more computationally demanding than
similar MC schemes for standard stochastic volatility models.
  In this paper, we provide a proof of the prediction law for general Gaussian
Volterra processes. The prediction law is then utilized to obtain an adapted
projection of the future squared volatility -- a cornerstone of the proposed
pricing approximation. Firstly, a decomposition formula for European option
prices under general Volterra volatility models is introduced. Then we focus on
particular models with rough fractional volatility and we derive an explicit
semi-closed approximation formula. Numerical properties of the approximation
for a popular model -- the rBergomi model -- are studied and we propose a
hybrid calibration scheme which combines the approximation formula alongside MC
simulations. This scheme can significantly speed up the calibration to
financial markets as illustrated on a set of AAPL options.

We show how optimally-chiral illumination induces balanced electric and

generating optimally-chiral scattered and total nearfield. In particular, we
explore helicity and energy densities in nearfield of a spherical dielectric
nanoantenna illuminated by an optimally-chiral combination of azimuthally and
radially polarized beams that generates parallel induced electric and magnetic
dipole moments that in turn also generate optimally-chiral scattered field with
the same handedness of the incident field. The application of helicity
maximization to nearfields results in helicity enhancement at nanoscale which
is of great advantage in the detection of nanoscale chiral samples, microscopy,
and optical manipulation of chiral nanoparticles.

the game of Cops and Robbers on graphs, Discrete Math., 341 (2018) 2418-2430].
The throttling number $th_c(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum possible value of
$k + capt_k(G)$ over all positive integers $k$, where $capt_k(G)$ is the number
of rounds needed for $k$ cops to capture the robber on $G$. One of the problems
from [Breen et al., 2018] was to determine whether there exists a family of
trees $T$ of order $n$ for which $th_c(T)$ is asymptotically equal to $2
\sqrt{n}$. We show that such a family cannot exist by improving the upper bound
on $\displaystyle \max_{T} th_c(T)$ for all trees $T$ of order $n$ from $2
\sqrt{n}$ to $\frac{\sqrt{14}}{2} \sqrt{n} + O(1)$. We prove this bound by
deriving a more general throttling bound for connected graphs that applies to
multiple graph adversaries, including the robber and the gambler. This also
improves the best known upper bounds on $th_c(G)$ for chordal graphs and
unicyclic graphs $G$, as well as throttling numbers for positive semidefinite
(PSD) zero forcing on trees. In addition to the results about cop versus
robber, we use our general throttling bound to improve previous upper bounds on
throttling numbers for the cop versus gambler game on connected graphs.
  Another open problem from [Breen et al., 2018] was to obtain a bound on
$th_c(G)$ for cactus graphs $G$. We prove an $O(\sqrt{n})$ bound for all cactus
graphs $G$ of order $n$. Furthermore, we exhibit a family of trees $T$ of order
$n$ that have $th_c(T) > 1.4502 \sqrt{n}$ for all $n$ sufficiently large,
improving on the previous lower bound of $\lceil \sqrt{2n}-\frac{1}{2} \rceil +
1$ on $\displaystyle \max_{T} th_c(T)$ for trees $T$ of order $n$.

memristor. Inspired by the recent quantization of the memristor, a simplified
Hodgkin-Huxley model including a single ion channel has been studied in the
quantum regime. Here, we study the quantization of the complete Hodgkin-Huxley
model, accounting for all three ion channels, and introduce a quantum source,
together with an output waveguide as the connection to a subsequent neuron. Our
system consists of two memristors and one resistor, describing potassium,
sodium, and chloride ion channel conductances, respectively, and a capacitor to
account for the axon's membrane capacitance. We study the behavior of both ion
channel conductivities and the circuit voltage, and we compare the results with
those of the single channel, for a given quantum state of the source. It is
remarkable that, in opposition to the single-channel model, we are able to
reproduce the voltage spike in an adiabatic regime. Arguing that the circuit
voltage is a quantum variable, we find a purely quantum-mechanical contribution

manufacturing and maintenance of products. Therefore, the mesh-based finite
element descriptions common in structural optimisation must be first translated
into CAD models. Currently, this can at best be performed semi-manually. We
propose a fully automated and topologically accurate approach to synthesise a
structurally-sound parametric CAD model from topology optimised finite element
models. Our solution is to first convert the topology optimised structure into
a spatial frame structure and then to regenerate it in a CAD system using
standard constructive solid geometry (CSG) operations. The obtained parametric
CAD models are compact, that is, have as few as possible geometric parameters,
which makes them ideal for editing and further processing within a CAD system.
The critical task of converting the topology optimised structure into an
optimal spatial frame structure is accomplished in several steps. We first
generate from the topology optimised voxel model a one-voxel-wide voxel chain
model using a topology-preserving skeletonisation algorithm from digital
topology. The weighted undirected graph defined by the voxel chain model yields
a spatial frame structure after processing it with standard graph algorithms.
Subsequently, we optimise the cross-sections and layout of the frame members to
recover its optimality, which may have been compromised during the conversion
process. At last, we generate the obtained frame structure in a CAD system by
repeatedly combining primitive solids, like cylinders and spheres, using
boolean operations. The resulting solid model is a boundary representation
(B-Rep) consisting of trimmed non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) curves and
surfaces.

attempt to measure the shapes of billions of galaxies in order to derive
cosmological information. These surveys will attain very low levels of
statistical error, and systematic errors must be extremely well controlled. In
particular, the point spread function (PSF) must be estimated using stars in
the field, and recovered with high accuracy.
  Aims. The aims of this paper are twofold. Firstly, we took steps toward a
nonparametric method to address the issue of recovering the PSF field, namely
that of finding the correct PSF at the position of any galaxy in the field,
applicable to Euclid. Our approach relies solely on the data, as opposed to
parametric methods that make use of our knowledge of the instrument. Secondly,
we studied the impact of imperfect PSF models on the shape measurement of
galaxies themselves, and whether common assumptions about this impact hold true
in an Euclid scenario.
  Methods. We extended the recently proposed resolved components analysis
approach, which performs super-resolution on a field of under-sampled
observations of a spatially varying, image-valued function. We added a spatial
interpolation component to the method, making it a true 2-dimensional PSF
model. We compared our approach to PSFEx, then quantified the impact of PSF
recovery errors on galaxy shape measurements through image simulations.
  Results. Our approach yields an improvement over PSFEx in terms of the PSF
model and on observed galaxy shape errors, though it is at present far from
reaching the required Euclid accuracy. We also find that the usual formalism
used for the propagation of PSF model errors to weak lensing quantities no
longer holds in the case of an Euclid-like PSF. In particular, different shape
measurement approaches can react differently to the same PSF modeling errors.

several optimization steps to recover optimal parameters from the model's

gradient descents to gradient-free optimizers. Many gradient-free optimizers
just need comparisons (better/worse than another image), so that they can even
be used without numerical criterion, without inspirational image, but with only
with human preference. Thus, by iterating on one's preferences we could make

directly utilize the underlying microelectronics, but that intrinsic randomness
can be limited and may thus be predicted, especially by machine learning.

light propagation in a silicon disk resonator, and (ii) surface plasmons

elaborate on the physical phenomena, provide simulation results, and conduct a

subcultures formed as an ""alternative"" to the dominant way of life. In
particular, I explore how the Internet of Things (IoT) or intelligent agents
relates to alternative forms of interaction or be understood and reconstructed
through alternative concepts or frameworks. For the past three years I have
been conducting fieldwork on communities pursuing alternative lifestyles. This
work considers how those alternative lifestyles may contribute to an
understanding of objects, spaces in future smart home. Through my fieldwork and
research through design, I hope to offer an alternative vision to living with
IoT and envision future domesticity in a unique and even groundbreaking way.

  Automate, Share, Build, and Care, (arXiv:1906.06089)",,,"IOTD/2019/04","cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The popularity of voice-controlled smart speakers with intelligent personal
assistants (IPAs) like the Amazon Echo and their increasing use as an interface
for other Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in the home provides
opportunities to study smart speakers as an emerging and ubiquitous IoT device.
Prior research has studied how smart speaker usage has unfolded in homes and
how the devices have been integrated into people's daily routines. In this
context, researchers have also observed instances of smart speakers' 'black
box' behaviour. In this position paper, we present findings from a study we
conducted to specifically investigate such challenges people experience around
intelligibility and control of their smart speakers, for instance, when the
smart speaker interfaces with other IoT systems. Reflecting on our findings, we
discuss new possible directions for smart speakers including physical
intelligibility, situational physical interaction, and providing access to
alternative interpretations in shared and non-shared contexts.
