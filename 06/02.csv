pressure through a modulated antiferromagnetic phase as well as tri-critical
wing structure in its temperature-pressure-magnetic field ($T$-$p$-$H$) phase
diagram. In order to understand the static and dynamical magnetic properties of
LaCrGe$_3$, we carried out $^{139}$La nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
measurements. Based on the analysis of NMR data, using the
self-consistent-renomalization (SCR) theory, the spin fluctuations in the
paramagnetic state are revealed to be isotropic ferromagnetic and three
dimensional (3D) in nature. Moreover, the system is found to follow the
generalized Rhodes-Wohfarth relation which is expected in 3D itinerant
ferromagnetic systems. As compared to other similar itinerant ferromagnets, the
Cr 3$d$ electrons and their spin fluctuations are characterized to have a
relatively high degree of localization in real space.

or enforced in classification. Individual Fairness [Dwork, Hardt, Pitassi,
Reingold, Zemel, 2012], which requires that similar individuals be treated
similarly, is a highly appealing definition as it gives strong guarantees on
treatment of individuals. Unfortunately, the need for a task-specific
similarity metric has prevented its use in practice. In this work, we propose a
solution to the problem of approximating a metric for Individual Fairness based
on human judgments. Our model assumes that we have access to a human fairness
arbiter, who can answer a limited set of queries concerning similarity of
individuals for a particular task, is free of explicit biases and possesses
sufficient domain knowledge to evaluate similarity. Our contributions include
definitions for metric approximation relevant for Individual Fairness,
constructions for approximations from a limited number of realistic queries to
the arbiter on a sample of individuals, and learning procedures to construct
hypotheses for metric approximations which generalize to unseen samples under
certain assumptions of learnability of distance threshold functions.

fibers in viscous flows based on slender body theory. Slender body theory
approximates the fluid velocity field about the fiber as the flow due to a
distribution of singular solutions to the Stokes equations along the fiber
centerline. The velocity of the fiber itself is often approximated by an
asymptotic limit of this expression. Here we investigate the efficacy of simply
evaluating the slender body velocity expression on a curve along the surface of
the actual 3D fiber, rather than limiting to the fiber centerline. Doing so may
yield an expression better suited for numerical simulation. We validate this
model for two simple geometries, namely, thin ellipsoids and thin rings, and we
compare the model to results in the literature for constant and shear flow. In
the case of a fiber with straight centerline, the model coincides with the
prolate spheroid model of Jeffery. For the thin torus, the computed force
agrees with the asymptotically accurate values of Johnson and Wu and gives
qualitatively similar dynamics to oblate spheroids of similar size and inertia

of unrelated stochastic optimization problems, each with limited data.
Intuition suggests one can decouple these unrelated problems and solve them

prove that combining data across problems can outperform decoupling, even when
there is no a priori structure linking the problems and data are drawn
independently. Our approach does not require strong distributional assumptions

setting that are not present in estimation. We further prove that as the number

decoupling and the optimal amount to pool, even if the average amount of data
per problem is fixed and bounded. Importantly, we highlight a simple intuition
based on stability that highlights when and why data-pooling offers a benefit,
elucidating this perhaps surprising phenomenon. This intuition further suggests
that data-pooling offers the most benefits when there are many problems, each

significant attention and there have been active research efforts on defense
mechanisms. Stochastic input transformation methods have been proposed, where
the idea is to recover the image from adversarial attack by random
transformation, and to take the majority vote as consensus among the random
samples. However, the transformation improves the accuracy on adversarial
images at the expense of the accuracy on clean images. While it is intuitive
that the accuracy on clean images would deteriorate, the exact mechanism in
which how this occurs is unclear. In this paper, we study the distribution of
softmax induced by stochastic transformations. We observe that with random
transformations on the clean images, although the mass of the softmax
distribution could shift to the wrong class, the resulting distribution of
softmax could be used to correct the prediction. Furthermore, on the
adversarial counterparts, with the image transformation, the resulting shapes
of the distribution of softmax are similar to the distributions from the clean
images. With these observations, we propose a method to improve existing
transformation-based defenses. We train a separate lightweight distribution
classifier to recognize distinct features in the distributions of softmax
outputs of transformed images. Our empirical studies show that our distribution
classifier, by training on distributions obtained from clean images only,
outperforms majority voting for both clean and adversarial images. Our method
is generic and can be integrated with existing transformation-based defenses.

discriminators, which have a family of Boolean $k$-ary functions $\mathcal{G}$.
Each function $g\in \mathcal{G}$ naturally defines a hyper-graph, indicating
whether a given hyper-edge exists. A function $g\in \mathcal{G}$ distinguishes
between two distributions, if the expected value of $g$, on a $k$-tuple of

having $k\geq 2$ as distinguishers. For $k\geq 2$ we introduce a notion similar

this case, since the symmetric positive definiteness (SPD) and sparsity of the

properties, but turns out to have intimate connections to a sign-inverted
variant of the Hopfield model. The Hamiltonian contains only 2-spin
interactions, with the coupler matrix following a type of Wishart distribution.
The class exhibits a classical first-order phase transition in temperature. For
some parameter settings the model has a locally-stable paramagnetic state, a
feature which correlates strongly with difficulty in finding the ground state
and suggests an extremely rugged energy landscape. We analytically probe the
ensemble thermodynamic properties by deriving the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer
equations and free energy and corroborate the results with a replica and
annealed approximation analysis; extensive Monte Carlo simulations confirm our
predictions of the first-order transition temperature. The class exhibits a
wide variation in algorithmic hardness as a generation parameter is varied,
with a pronounced easy-hard-easy profile and peak in solution time towering
many orders of magnitude over that of the easy regimes. By deriving the
ensemble-averaged energy distribution and taking into account finite-precision
representation, we propose an analytical expression for the location of the
hardness peak and show that at fixed precision, the number of constraints in
the integer program must increase with system size to yield truly hard

active phase-separation of repulsive discs and collective motion of

Inspired by the quanto-mechanical wave-particle duality, we develop an approach
based on the representation of active particles by smoothed continuum fields.
On the basis of the collision kinetics, we demonstrate analytically and
numerically how nonequilibrium stresses acting among self-driven, anisotropic
objects hinder the formation of phase-separated states as observed for
self-propelled discs and facilitate the emergence of orientational order.
Besides particle shape, the rigidity of self-propelled objects controlling the
symmetry of emergent ordered states is as a crucial parameter: impenetrable,
anisotropic rods are found to form polar, moving clusters, whereas large-scale
nematic structures emerge for soft rods, notably separated by a bistable
coexistence regime. These results indicate that the symmetry of the ordered
state is not dictated by the symmetry of the interaction potential but is
rather a dynamical, emergent property of active systems. This unifying
theoretical framework can represent a variety of active systems: living cell
tissues, bacterial colonies, cytoskeletal extracts as well as shaken granular
media.

whether the model uses the correct image regions to output particular words, or
if the model is hallucinating based on priors in the dataset and/or the
language model. The most common way of relating image regions with words in
caption models is through an attention mechanism over the regions that are used
as input to predict the next word. The model must therefore learn to predict
the attentional weights without knowing the word it should localize. This is
difficult to train without grounding supervision since recurrent models can
propagate past information and there is no explicit signal to force the
captioning model to properly ground the individual decoded words. In this work,
we help the model to achieve this via a novel cyclical training regimen that
forces the model to localize each word in the image after the sentence decoder
generates it, and then reconstruct the sentence from the localized image
region(s) to match the ground-truth. Our proposed framework only requires
learning one extra fully-connected layer (the localizer), a layer that can be
removed at test time. We show that our model significantly improves grounding

height and mean wave period. We propose a joint spatial model of these two

random field is modeled as a solution to a system of coupled stochastic partial

non-stationary anisotropy and allows for arbitrary, and different,
differentiability for the two marginal fields.
  The parameters of the model are estimated on data of the north Atlantic using

latency and reliability requirements of factory automation applications are
met. In particular, we evaluate the co-existence of the eMBB and URLLC networks
under two scenarios: (i) synchronized TDD, in which both networks follow the
same TDD pattern, and (ii) unsynchronized TDD, in which the eMBB and URLLC

promising case for co-existence is the adjacent channel allocation, for both

achieve their targeted error rate, researchers should instead cluster standard
errors at the pair level. Using simulations, we show that similar results apply
to clustered experiments with small strata.

optimization methods usually perform well only in specific settings, and their
performance depends highly on the geometry of the decision space and cost
functions. However, in practice, lack of such geometric information leads to
confusion in using the appropriate algorithm. To address this issue, some
adaptive methods have been proposed that focus on adaptively learning
parameters such as step size, Lipschitz constant, and strong convexity
coefficient, or on specific parametric families such as quadratic regularizers.
In this work, we generalize these methods and propose a framework that competes
with the best algorithm in a family of expert algorithms. Our framework
includes many of the well-known adaptive methods including MetaGrad,
MetaGrad+C, and Ader. We also introduce a second algorithm that computationally
outperforms our first algorithm with at most a constant factor increase in

study the problem of learning the best regularizer from a family of
regularizers for Online Mirror Descent. Empirically, we support our theoretical
findings in the problem of learning the best regularizer on the simplex and

interest for fundamental studies and quantum technology developments, where
collective many-body effects play an important role. In this work we analyze
the efficiency of two QHEs where the working substance exhibits second order
quantum phase transitions (QPT). One of these engines is defined by the working
substance corresponding to the anisotropic Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model and
the other to the full Dicke model. We consider that, working at thermal
equilibrium, the heat engines realize a thermodynamic Stirling cycle type. For
both QHEs, a remarkable enhancement of efficiency is obtained when during the
cycle the working substances undergo a QPT, where eventually the efficiency
reaches the Carnot bound. We also analyze the effect of the degree of
anisotropy in the interaction term of the LMG model and the unbalance between
rotating and counter-rotating terms in the full Dicke model. It is observed a
better efficiency increase when the interaction term in the LMG model is more
anisotropic, and in the full Dicke model, when the rotating and
counter-rotating interaction terms are equally balanced. We discuss an
equivalence between our Stirling cycle and the Carnot cycle at some particular
values of the model parameters, where maximum efficiencies are attained. It is
also analyzed how the ground state degeneracy in the QPT is associated to such
maximum efficiency. Finally, these behaviors are related to the symmetries of
the models that break at the phase transition.

multi-class classification, and probabilistic label trees (PLTs) that
generalize HSM to multi-label problems. If the tree structure is given,
learning of PLT can be solved with provable regret guaranties [Wydmuch et.al.

  In this paper, we address the problem of finding a tree structure that has
low computational cost. First, we show that finding a tree with optimal

cases with either perfect approximation or exact solution that can be obtained
in linear time in terms of the number of labels $m$. For the general case, we
obtain $O(\log m)$ approximation in linear time too. Moreover, we prove an

idea merits our attention. This rapport identifies necessary conditions for a
well-defined general-relativistic joint initial value problem of $N$ classical
point charges and their electromagnetic and gravitational fields. Among them,
in particular, is the requirement that the electromagnetic vacuum law
guarantees a finite field energy-momentum of a point charge. This disqualifies
the Maxwell(--Lorentz) law used by EIH. On the positive side, if the
electromagnetic vacuum law of Bopp, Land\'e--Thomas, and Podolsky (BLTP) is
used, and the singularities equipped with a non-zero bare rest mass, then a
joint initial value problem can be formulated in the spirit of the EIH
proposal, and shown to be locally well-posed --- \emph{in the
special-relativistic zero-$G$ limit}. With gravitational coupling (i.e. $G>0$),
though, changing Maxwell's into the BLTP law and assigning a bare rest mass to
the singularities is by itself not sufficient to obtain even a merely

perspective of sparse Bayesian learning (SBL). Generally, it is intractable to
perform the Bayesian inference with the ideal discretization prior under the
SBL framework. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel discretization
enforcing prior to exploit the knowledge of the discrete nature of the
signal-of-interest. By integrating the discretization enforcing prior into the
SBL framework and applying the variational Bayesian inference (VBI)
methodology, we devise an alternating optimization algorithm to jointly
characterize the finite-alphabet feature and reconstruct the unknown signal.
When the measurement matrix is i.i.d. Gaussian per component, we further embed
the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) into the VBI-based method,
so as to directly adopt the ideal prior and significantly reduce the
computational burden. Simulation results demonstrate substantial performance
improvement of the two proposed methods over existing schemes. Moreover, the
GAMP-based variant outperforms the VBI-based method with i.i.d. Gaussian
measurement matrices but it fails to work for non i.i.d. Gaussian matrices.

using the planar impact of flyer plates to generate large transient negative

gas-gun to launch thin sabot-supported flyer plates onto liquid capsule targets
in which a thin Mylar diaphragm formed a free surface at the back of the
sample. The shock wave driven into the target capsule by the flyer impact
placed the silicone oil in tension upon reflection from the rear free surface,
eventually causing the sample to cavitate. The spall strength, or critical
tension which cavitates the liquid, was determined by monitoring the
free-surface velocity using a photonic Doppler velocimetry system. This study
explored the effect of viscosity and loading strain rate on a system of three
silicone oils having vastly different viscosities (4.8$\times$10$^{-2}$ Pa s to
2.9$~\times$10$^{1}$ Pa s), but otherwise similar properties. The spall

viscosities probed in this work. A comparison of the experimental results to

nucleation of bubbles was the dominant mechanism for tension relief at the

result, as soon as the support of distributions of data and model contain
non-overlapping portions, gradient based training of the corresponding model

the objective function to integral probability measures (IPMs) that are
well-behaved even on disjoint probabilities, or optimizing a well-behaved
variational lower bound instead of the true objective. We, on the other hand,
establish that a complete change of the objective function is unnecessary, and
instead an augmentation of the base measure of the problematic divergence can
resolve the issue. Based on this observation, we propose a generative model

a more universal model where the constants are replaced by physically
significant parameters. This enables the user to understand and to trace back
how a modification of design parameters (geometry, fluid condition) will affect
acoustic properties. The derivation of the model is supported by a detailed
three-dimensional direct numerical simulation as well as an experimental test

arbitrary geometries: Just the provided definitions need to be applied to
update the significant parameters. Utilizing the lumped-element method, the
model consists of exchangeable elements and guarantees a flexible use. Even

of the dust within it. The chemical composition of the condensate changes with
time and radius. We compare the results of two dust condensation models: one
where an element condenses when the midplane temperature in the disc is lower
than the 50\% condensation temperature ($\rm T_{50}$) of that element and the
other where the condensation of the dust is calculated by a Gibbs free energy
minimization technique assuming chemical equilibrium at local disc temperature
and pressure. The results of two models are generally consistent with some
systematic differences of $\sim 10$\% depending upon the radial distance and an
element's condensation temperature. Both models predict compositions similar to
CM, CO, and CV chondrites provided that the decoupling timescale of the dust is
on the order of the evolution timescale of the disc or longer. If the
decoupling timescale is too short, the composition deviates significantly from
the measured values. These models may contribute to our understanding of the

their bound is sublinear in the matrix size, which is unachievable for general

is not suitable for real-time control and optimization. This paper presents a
novel approximate linearized model for building's thermal dynamics and the HVAC
system power consumption that leads to a computationally efficient linear model
predictive controller (LMPC) for the buildings' HVAC systems. We employ
feedback linearization technique to obtain an equivalent linearized model for
the nonlinear thermal building dynamics and use constraint mapping approach to
obtain a linearized formulation for new control variables. Next, using
piecewise linearization, we obtain a linearized analytical model for the HVAC

multiple simulation case studies. We demonstrate that the proposed LMPC

a future time window)? Previous studies on predicting user app engagement
mainly focus on various macroscopic features (e.g., time-series of activity
frequency), while ignoring fine-grained inter-dependencies between different
in-app actions at the microscopic level. Here we propose to formalize
individual user's in-app action transition patterns as a temporally evolving
action graph, and analyze its characteristics in terms of informing future user
engagement. Our analysis suggested that action graphs are able to characterize
user behavior patterns and inform future engagement. We derive a number of
high-order graph features to capture in-app usage patterns and construct
interpretable models for predicting trends of engagement changes and active
rates. To further enhance predictive power, we design an end-to-end,
multi-channel neural model to encode temporal action graphs, activity

engagement for 150k Snapchat new users over a 28-day period demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed models. The prediction framework is deployed at

cannot guarantee synthetic images always precisely model visual context, and
all of them require external datasets. To handle above issues, this paper
proposes a simple yet effective instance-switching (IS) strategy, which
generates new training data by switching instances of same class from different

while requiring no external dataset. For guiding our IS to obtain better object

datasets, which frequently occur and bring adverse effect on detection
performance. To this end, we propose a novel Progressive and Selective

The proposed PSIS enhances instance balance by combining selective re-sampling
with a class-balanced loss, and considers class importance by progressively
augmenting training dataset guided by detection performance. The experiments
are conducted on the challenging MS COCO benchmark, and results demonstrate our
PSIS brings clear improvement over various state-of-the-art detectors (e.g.,

control network congestion. RCP estimates it's fair rate from two forms of
feedback: rate mismatch and queue size. An important design question that
remains open in RCP is whether the presence of queue size feedback is helpful,
given the presence of feedback from rate mismatch. The feedback from routers to
end-systems is time delayed, and may introduce instabilities and complex
non-linear dynamics. Delay dynamical systems are often modeled using delay
differential equations to facilitate a mathematical analysis of their
performance and dynamics. The RCP models with and without queue size feedback
give rise to two distinct non-linear delay differential equations. Earlier work
on this design question was based on methods of linear systems theory. For
further progress, it is quite natural to employ nonlinear techniques. In this
study, we approach this design question using tools from control and
bifurcation theory. The analytical results reveal that the removal of queue
feedback could enhance both stability and convergence properties. Further,
using Poincar\'{e} normal forms and center manifold theory, we investigate two
nonlinear properties, namely, the type of Hopf bifurcation and the asymptotic
stability of the bifurcating limit cycles. We show that the presence of queue
feedback in the RCP can lead to a sub-critical Hopf bifurcation, which would
give rise either to the onset of large amplitude limit cycles or to unstable
limit cycles. Whereas, in the absence of queue feedback, the Hopf bifurcation
is always super-critical and the bifurcating limit cycles are stable. The
analysis is complemented with computations and some packet-level simulations as
well. In terms of design, our study suggests that the presence of both forms of
feedback may be detrimental to the performance of RCP.

Monolayer WS$_{2}$ exposed to ambient conditions in the presence of light

correlated with 'high-symmetry' and red-shifted areas in the PL spectroscopy
map - areas thought to contain a higher concentration of sulfur vacancies. In
contrast, samples kept in ambient and darkness showed no signs of oxidation for
up to 10 months. Low-irradiance/fluence experiments showed that samples
subjected to excitation energies at or above the trion excitation energy (532

the target language, is a long-standing natural language processing task.
Recent endeavors prove that it is promising to employ images as pivot to learn
the lexicon induction without reliance on parallel corpora. However, these
vision-based approaches simply associate words with entire images, which are
constrained to translate concrete words and require object-centered images. We
humans can understand words better when they are within a sentence with
context. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to utilize images and their
associated captions to address the limitations of previous approaches. We
propose a multi-lingual caption model trained with different mono-lingual
multimodal data to map words in different languages into joint spaces. Two
types of word representation are induced from the multi-lingual caption model:
linguistic features and localized visual features. The linguistic feature is
learned from the sentence contexts with visual semantic constraints, which is
beneficial to learn translation for words that are less visual-relevant. The
localized visual feature is attended to the region in the image that correlates
to the word, so that it alleviates the image restriction for salient visual
representation. The two types of features are complementary for word
translation. Experimental results on multiple language pairs demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method, which substantially outperforms previous
vision-based approaches without using any parallel sentences or supervision of
seed word pairs.

an attacker to determine whether a given data record was part of the model's
training data or not. In this paper, we provide an in-depth study of the
phenomenon of disparate vulnerability against MIAs: unequal success rate of
MIAs against different population subgroups. We first establish necessary and
sufficient conditions for MIAs to be prevented, both on average and for
population subgroups, using a notion of distributional generalization. Second,
we derive connections of disparate vulnerability to algorithmic fairness and to
differential privacy. We show that fairness can only prevent disparate
vulnerability against limited classes of adversaries. Differential privacy
bounds disparate vulnerability but can significantly reduce the accuracy of the
model. We show that estimating disparate vulnerability to MIAs by na\""ively
applying existing attacks can lead to overestimation. We then establish which
attacks are suitable for estimating disparate vulnerability, and provide a
statistical framework for doing so reliably. We conduct experiments on
synthetic and real-world data finding statistically significant evidence of
disparate vulnerability in realistic settings. The code is available at

recommendations. Most existing recommendation algorithms rely on extensive
observed data and are brittle to recommendation scenarios with few
interactions. This paper addresses such problems using few-shot learning and
meta learning. Our approach is based on the insight that having a good
generalization from a few examples relies on both a generic model
initialization and an effective strategy for adapting this model to newly
arising tasks. To accomplish this, we combine the scenario-specific learning
with a model-agnostic sequential meta-learning and unify them into an
integrated end-to-end framework, namely Scenario-specific Sequential Meta
learner (or s^2 meta). By doing so, our meta-learner produces a generic initial
model through aggregating contextual information from a variety of prediction
tasks while effectively adapting to specific tasks by leveraging
learning-to-learn knowledge. Extensive experiments on various real-world
datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can achieve significant gains over
the state-of-the-arts for cold-start problems in online recommendation.

Complete Intersection Calabi Yau (CICY) manifolds of Picard number two. Our
results provide further evidence that the cohomology dimensions of such line
bundles are given by analytic expressions, which change between regions in the
line bundle charge space. This agrees with recent observations of CY line
bundles presented in Refs [1,2]. In many cases, the expressions for bundle
cohomology dimensions are polynomial functions of the line bundle charges (of
degree at most 3), and the regions are cones. A more novel observation is that
for some CICY manifolds, the cohomologies are more succinctly determined by
recursive relationships. There can also be boundaries between regions where a
polynomial fit fails, and we link these exceptional cases to irregular
behaviour of the index of the line bundle. Finally, our observations provide
evidence for similarities in the line bundle cohomologies for CICY manifolds
that share rows in the configuration matrix. Among such related CICY manifolds,
we find both that the line bundle charge space is partitioned in the same
manner, and that the same, or closely related, analytical descriptions apply
for the cohomology dimensions in these regions.

the conflict was described by master equations, i.e. a set of differential

Here we reformulate the problem in terms of probabilistic cellular automata.
The obtained results for number $n(A,B)$ of actors of status $(A,B)$ are
qualitatively the same as in the previous approach, both for synchronous and
asynchronous version of the automaton. Namely, an enhancement of the surface
status compensates a deficiency of the real one.

paper, we argue that it is feasible to identify depression at an early stage by

propose a novel classifier, namely, Cost-sensitive Boosting Pruning Trees

Finally, we comprehensively explore the influence factors of model prediction,

policies for robot systems, when the dynamics of the target robot system are
unknown. The success of policies trained with domain randomization however, is
highly dependent on the correct selection of the randomization distribution.
The majority of success stories typically use real world data in order to
carefully select the DR distribution, or incorporate real world trajectories to
better estimate appropriate randomization distributions. In this paper, we
consider the problem of finding good domain randomization parameters for
simulation, without prior access to data from the target system. We explore the
use of gradient-based search methods to learn a domain randomization with the
following properties: 1) The trained policy should be successful in
environments sampled from the domain randomization distribution 2) The domain
randomization distribution should be wide enough so that the experience similar
to the target robot system is observed during training, while addressing the
practicality of training finite capacity models. These two properties aim to
ensure the trajectories encountered in the target system are close to those
observed during training, as existing methods in machine learning are better
suited for interpolation than extrapolation. We show how adapting the domain
randomization distribution while training context-conditioned policies results
in improvements on jump-start and asymptotic performance when transferring a
learned policy to the target environment.

semantic network of technology-related data for engineering knowledge
discovery, technology search and retrieval, and artificial intelligence for
engineering design and innovation. Specially, we constructed a technology
semantic network (TechNet) that covers the elemental concepts in all domains of
technology and their semantic associations by mining the complete U.S. patent
database from 1976. To derive the TechNet, natural language processing
techniques were utilized to extract terms from massive patent texts and recent
word embedding algorithms were employed to vectorize such terms and establish
their semantic relationships. We report and evaluate the TechNet for retrieving
terms and their pairwise relevance that is meaningful from a technology and
engineering design perspective. The TechNet may serve as an infrastructure to
support a wide range of applications, e.g., technical text summaries, search
query predictions, relational knowledge discovery, and design ideation support,
in the context of engineering and technology, and complement or enrich existing
semantic databases. To enable such applications, the TechNet is made public via
an online interface and APIs for public users to retrieve technology-related
terms and their relevancies.

for (prompt) $D$ mesons compared to charged hadrons for transverse momenta

less energies in quark-gluon plasma than light quarks and gluons. Recent
measurements of the nuclear modification factors of $B$ mesons and $B$-decayed
$D$ mesons by the CMS Collaboration provide a unique opportunity to study the
flavor hierarchy of jet quenching. Using a linear Boltzmann transport model
combined with hydrodynamics simulation, we study the energy loss and nuclear
modification for heavy and light flavor jets in high-energy nuclear collisions.
By consistently taking into account both quark and gluon contributions to light
and heavy flavor hadron productions within a next-to-leading order perturbative
QCD framework, we obtain, for the first time, a satisfactory description of the
experimental data on the nuclear modification factors for charged hadrons, $D$
mesons, $B$ mesons and $B$-decayed $D$ mesons simultaneously over a wide range
of transverse momenta (8-300~GeV). This presents a solid solution to the flavor
puzzle of jet quenching and constitutes a significant step towards the
precision study of jet-medium interaction. Our study predicts that at
transverse momenta larger than 30-40~GeV, $B$ mesons also exhibit similar
suppression effects to charged hadrons and $D$ mesons, which may be tested by
future measurements.

To appear in STOC '19",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given an edge-weighted graph, how many minimum $k$-cuts can it have? This is
a fundamental question in the intersection of algorithms, extremal
combinatorics, and graph theory. It is particularly interesting in that the
best known bounds are algorithmic: they stem from algorithms that compute the
minimum $k$-cut.
  In 1994, Karger and Stein obtained a randomized contraction algorithm that
finds a minimum $k$-cut in $O(n^{(2-o(1))k})$ time. It can also enumerate all
such $k$-cuts in the same running time, establishing a corresponding extremal
bound of $O(n^{(2-o(1))k})$. Since then, the algorithmic side of the minimum
$k$-cut problem has seen much progress, leading to a deterministic algorithm
based on a tree packing result of Thorup, which enumerates all minimum $k$-cuts
in the same asymptotic running time, and gives an alternate proof of the
$O(n^{(2-o(1))k})$ bound. However, beating the Karger--Stein bound, even for
computing a single minimum $k$-cut, has remained out of reach.
  In this paper, we give an algorithm to enumerate all minimum $k$-cuts in
$O(n^{(1.981+o(1))k})$ time, breaking the algorithmic and extremal barriers for
enumerating minimum $k$-cuts. To obtain our result, we combine ideas from both
the Karger--Stein and Thorup results, and draw a novel connection between
minimum $k$-cut and extremal set theory. In particular, we give and use tighter
bounds on the size of set systems with bounded dual VC-dimension, which may be
of independent interest.

obstacle avoidance tasks in three different environments and Deep Q Networks
(DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) trainers. Air Learning assesses
the policies' performance under various quality-of-flight (QoF) metrics, such
as the energy consumed, endurance, and the average trajectory length, on
resource-constrained embedded platforms like a Raspberry Pi. We find that the
trajectories on an embedded Ras-Pi are vastly different from those predicted on
a high-end desktop system, resulting in up to 40% longer trajectories in one of
the environments. To understand the source of such discrepancies, we use Air
Learning to artificially degrade high-end desktop performance to mimic what
happens on a low-end embedded system. We then propose a mitigation technique
that uses the hardware-in-the-loop to determine the latency distribution of
running the policy on the target platform (onboard compute on the aerial
robot). A randomly sampled latency from the latency distribution is then added
as an artificial delay within the training loop. Training the policy with
artificial delays allows us to minimize the hardware gap (discrepancy in the
flight time metric reduced from 37.73% to 0.5%). Thus, Air Learning with
hardware-in-the-loop characterizes those differences and exposes how the
onboard compute's choice affects the aerial robot's performance. We also
conduct reliability studies to assess the effect of sensor failures on the

Besides we introduce a notion of optimal vectorial Boolean functions relevant

are exactly perfect nonlinear functions (generalizations of Rothaus' bent

phalanx of the index finger-on haptic perception using a newly designed
wearable haptic device. The novel device can provide kinesthetic feedback to

each of the two feedback directions. Results show that among the studied
locations, grounding at proximal phalanx has a smaller average just noticeable
difference for both feedback directions, indicating a more sensitive haptic

highest with grounding at the middle phalanx for feedback along the finger

This shows that $\psi$-ontology theorems appear unable to prove that the wave
function cannot be interpreted as epistemic. We identify the criterion used to
decide if $\psi$ is epistemic or ontological as the misleading part. Different
states having overlaps is only sufficient for being epistemic. In an epistemic
interpretation the information which completely identifies the wave function
also has an objective base in reality - the preparation procedure, which has to
be really executed to prepare a state. Naming the $\lambda \in \Lambda$ ""hidden
variables"" and considering them as part of the state of the system we also
identify as misleading, because it hides the possibility that they may be
visible and external to the system. This leads to further misconceptions about
the consequences of the theorems.

$\widetilde\Omega=\Omega^2$. For such 3-dimensional frequency vectors, the
standard theory of continued fractions cannot be applied, so we develop a
methodology for determining the behavior of the small divisors $\langle
k,\omega\rangle$, $k\in{\mathbb Z}^3$. Applying the Poincar\'e-Melnikov method,
this allows us to carry out a careful study of the dominant harmonic (which
depends on $\varepsilon$) of the Melnikov function, obtaining an asymptotic
estimate for the maximal splitting distance, which is exponentially small in

the exponent, showing that it can be explicitly constructed from the resonance

Furthermore, we link the complex interaction dynamics of RBCs with the post to

known communities. It turns out that tuning parameters on such synthetic graph
also improves the quality for a given real-world network. To illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we show significant improvements
obtained for several well-known parametric community detection algorithms on a
variety of synthetic and real-world datasets.

  protein folding",,,,,"q-bio.QM physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fragment-based assembly has been widely used in Ab initio protein folding
simulation which can effectively reduce the conformational space and thus
accelerate sampling. The efficiency of fragment-based movement as well as the
quality of fragment library determine whether the folding process can lead the
free energy landscape to the global minimum and help the protein to reach
near-native folded state. We designed an improved fragment-based movement,
""fragmove"", which substituted multiple backbone dihedral angles in every
simulation step. This movement strategy was derived from the fragment library
generated by LRFragLib, an effective fragment detection algorithm using
logistic regression model. We show in replica exchange Monte Carlo (REMC)
simulation that ""fragmove"", when compared with a set of existing movements in
REMC, shows significant improved ability at increasing secondary and tertiary
predicted model accuracy by 11.24% and 17.98%, respectively and reaching energy
minima decreased by 5.72%. Our results demonstrate that this improved movement
is more powerful to guide proteins faster to low energy regions of
conformational space and promote folding efficiency and predicted model
accuracy.

  Network: Corrected and Expanded Version",,,,,"cs.NE cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based techniques have dominated
state-of-the-art results in most problems related to computer vision, audio
recognition, and natural language processing in the past few years, resulting
in strong industrial adoption from all leading technology companies worldwide.
One of the major obstacles that have historically delayed large scale adoption
of ANNs is the huge computational and power costs associated with training and
testing (deploying) them. In the mean-time, Neuromorphic Computing platforms
have recently achieved remarkable performance running more bio-realistic
Spiking Neural Networks at high throughput and very low power consumption
making them a natural alternative to ANNs. Here, we propose using the Random
Neural Network (RNN), a spiking neural network with both theoretical and
practical appealing properties, as a general purpose classifier that can match
the classification power of ANNs on a number of tasks while enjoying all the
features of a spiking neural network. This is demonstrated on a number of
real-world classification datasets.

of propagation. To account for propagation in preferred directions, the wave
equation is decomposed into a set of coupled equations for waves that propagate
in opposite directions along the preferred axis. This decomposition is not
unique. We discuss flux-normalised and field-normalised decomposition in a
systematic way, analyse the symmetry properties of the decomposition operators
and use these symmetry properties to derive reciprocity theorems for the
decomposed wave fields, for both types of normalisation. Based on the
field-normalised reciprocity theorems, we derive representation theorems for
decomposed wave fields. In particular we derive double- and single-sided
Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integrals for forward and backward propagation of
decomposed wave fields. The single-sided Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integrals for
backward propagation of field-normalised decomposed wave fields find
applications in reflection imaging, accounting for multiple scattering.

interferometer heterogeneously integrated in silicon photonics. The phase
shifter section is realized in a novel lateral MOS configuration, which, due to
favorable electrostatic overlap, leads to efficient modulation (V{\pi}L = 63
Vum). This is achieved by (i) selecting a strong index changing material (ITO)
and (ii) improving the field overlap as verified by the electrostatic field
lines. Furthermore, we show that this platform serves as a building block in an
endfire silicon photonics optical phased array (OPA) with a half-wavelength
pitch within the waveguides with anticipated performance, including narrow main
beam lobe (<3{\deg}) and >10 dB suppression of the side lobes, while
electrostatically steering the emission profile up to plus/minus 80{\deg}, and
if further engineered, can lead not only towards nanosecond-fast beam steering
capabilities in LiDAR systems but also in holographic display, free-space
optical communications, and optical switches.
