conventional first order time derivative is replaced by a Caputo fractional
derivative with order $\alpha\in(0,1)$. First, the well-posedness and (limited)
smoothing property are systematically analyzed, by using the maximal $L^p$
regularity of fractional evolution equations and the fractional Gr\""onwall's
inequality. We also show the maximum principle like their conventional
local-in-time counterpart. Precisely, the time-fractional equation preserves
the property that the solution only takes value between the wells of the
double-well potential when the initial data does the same. Second, after
discretizing the fractional derivative by backward Euler convolution
quadrature, we develop several unconditionally solvable and stable time
stepping schemes, i.e., convex splitting scheme, weighted convex splitting
scheme and linear weighted stabilized scheme. Meanwhile, we study the discrete
energy dissipation property (in a weighted average sense), which is important
for gradient flow type models, for the two weighted schemes. Finally, by using
a discrete version of fractional Gr\""onwall's inequality and maximal $\ell^p$
regularity, we prove that the convergence rates of those time-stepping schemes
are $O(\tau^\alpha)$ without any extra regularity assumption on the solution.
We also present extensive numerical results to support our theoretical findings
and to offer new insight on the time-fractional Allen-Cahn dynamics.

Therefore most of the time, some other sensors should accompany to video

considerable amount of work in this area in the last decade. In this paper we
make a review of impulsive sound detection algorithms. Sounds from dangerous
events such as gunshots, explosions, human screaming can be classified as
impulsive sounds, so this paper reviews all impulsive sound detection
algorithms along with impulsive noise detection algorithms although they
progress in their own path. These dangerous sound events have no other
detection means except audio. We try to adapt some algorithms used in impulsive

of transition frequency from this profile in a unique way. Nonresonant

closed expressions for the resonant photon scattering cross sections on an

membership inference have motivated multiple defenses against MIAs, e.g.,
differential privacy and adversarial regularization. Unfortunately, these

Our work proposes a new defense, called distillation for membership privacy

significantly better than prior defenses. DMP leverages knowledge distillation
to train ML models with membership privacy. We provide a novel criterion to
tune the data used for knowledge transfer in order to amplify the membership

better tradeoffs between membership privacy and classification accuracies

CIFAR100, for similar membership privacy (measured using MIA risk): when the

amongst several users and applications. As a result, declarative user queries
in these environments need to be optimized and executed over resources that
constantly change and are provisioned on demand for each job. This requires us
to rethink traditional query optimizers designed for systems that run on
dedicated resources. In this paper, we show evidence that the choice of query
plans depends heavily on the available resources, and the current practice of
choosing query plans before picking the resources could lead to significant
performance loss in two popular big data systems, namely Hive and SparkSQL.
Therefore, we make a case for Resource and Query Optimization (or RAQO), i.e.,
choosing both the query plan and the resource configuration at the same time.
We describe rule-based RAQO and present alternate decisions trees to make
resource-aware query planning in Hive and Spark. We further present cost-based
RAQO that integrates resource planning within a query planner, and show
techniques to significantly reduce the resource planning overheads. We evaluate
cost-based RAQO using state-of-the-art System R query planner as well as a

predefined path to collect data from the nearby sensors, which are referred as
sub-sinks. Due to the slow speed of the $MS$, the data delivery latency is
high. However, optimizing the {\em data gathering schedule}, i.e. optimizing
the transmission schedule of the sub-sinks to the $MS$ and the movement speed
of the $MS$ can reduce data gathering latency. We formulate two novel
optimization problems for data gathering in minimum time. The first problem
determines an optimal data gathering schedule of the $MS$ by controlling the
data transmission schedule and the speed of the $MS$, where the data
availabilities of the sub-sinks are given. The second problem generalizes the
first, where the data availabilities of the sub-sinks are unknown. Plane sweep
algorithms are proposed for finding optimal data gathering schedule and data
availabilities of the sub-sinks. The performances of the proposed algorithms
are evaluated through simulations. The simulation results reveal that the
optimal distribution of data among the sub-sinks together with optimal data

for $(-1)^nb>0$, provided that $$0 \neq (-1)^{n+1}b\,T^2< \tfrac{3}{2}\pi^2.$$

several important applications such as hiring, however, decisions are made in
multiple stage with additional information at each stage. In such cases,
fairness issues remain poorly understood.
  In this paper we study fairness in $k$-stage selection problems where
additional features are observed at every stage. We first introduce two
fairness notions, local (per stage) and global (final stage) fairness, that
extend the classical fairness notions to the $k$-stage setting. We propose a
simple model based on a probabilistic formulation and show that the locally and
globally fair selections that maximize precision can be computed via a linear
program. We then define the price of local fairness to measure the loss of
precision induced by local constraints; and investigate theoretically and
empirically this quantity. In particular, our experiments show that the price
of local fairness is generally smaller when the sensitive attribute is observed
at the first stage; but globally fair selections are more locally fair when the
sensitive attribute is observed at the second stage---hence in both cases it is
often possible to have a selection that has a small price of local fairness and
is close to locally fair.

Gaussian (LOG) and 64 bin discretization (BIN) (alone or in combinations) and
several features from images were extracted. The prediction performance of
model was checked using the area under the receiver operator characteristic
(ROC) curve (AUC). Results showed a wide range of radiomic model AUC
performances up to 0.75 in prediction of EGFR and KRAS mutation status.
Combination of K-Best and variance threshold feature selector with logistic

in EGFR (CTD-BIN+B-KB+LREG, AUC: mean 0.75 sd 0.10) and KRAS
(CTD-BIN-LOG-WAV+B-VT+LREG, AUC: mean 0.75 sd 0.07) respectively. Additionally,
incorporating PET, kept AUC values at ~0.74. When considering conventional
features only, highest predictive performance was achieved by PET SUVpeak (AUC:
0.69) for EGFR and by PET MTV (AUC: 0.55) for KRAS. In comparison with
conventional PET parameters such as standard uptake value, radiomic models were
found as more predictive. Our findings demonstrated that non-invasive and

particularly important when search is performed across very large datasets with
significant variability. We propose a novel CNN-based global descriptor, called
REMAP, which learns and aggregates a hierarchy of deep features from multiple
CNN layers, and is trained end-to-end with a triplet loss. REMAP explicitly
learns discriminative features which are mutually-supportive and complementary
at various semantic levels of visual abstraction. These dense local features
are max-pooled spatially at each layer, within multi-scale overlapping regions,
before aggregation into a single image-level descriptor. To identify the
semantically useful regions and layers for retrieval, we propose to measure the
information gain of each region and layer using KL-divergence. Our system
effectively learns during training how useful various regions and layers are
and weights them accordingly. We show that such relative entropy-guided
aggregation outperforms classical CNN-based aggregation controlled by SGD. The
entire framework is trained in an end-to-end fashion, outperforming the latest
state-of-the-art results. On image retrieval datasets Holidays, Oxford and

algorithms. A crucial step to understanding the rationale for this lack of
robustness is to assess the potential of the neural networks' representation to
encode the existing features. Here, we propose a method to understand the
representation quality of the neural networks using a novel test based on
Zero-Shot Learning, entitled Raw Zero-Shot. The principal idea is that, if an
algorithm learns rich features, such features should be able to interpret
""unknown"" classes as an aggregate of previously learned features. This is
because unknown classes usually share several regular features with recognised
classes, given the features learned are general enough. We further introduce
two metrics to assess these learned features to interpret unknown classes. One
is based on inter-cluster validation technique (Davies-Bouldin Index), and the
other is based on the distance to an approximated ground-truth. Experiments
suggest that adversarial defences improve the representation of the
classifiers, further suggesting that to improve the robustness of the
classifiers, one has to improve the representation quality also. Experiments
also reveal a strong association (a high Pearson Correlation and low p-value)
between the metrics and adversarial attacks. Interestingly, the results
indicate that dynamic routing networks such as CapsNet have better
representation while current deeper neural networks are trading off
representation quality for accuracy.

is a geometric Galois group over k, and is a pre-Galois group over k if k is
Hilbertian. For every finite group G, the same conclusion holds for G itself

good or bad a system is. In image classification, well-known networks only
consider modifying the network structures and applying cross-entropy loss at
the end of the network. However, using only cross-entropy loss causes a network
to stop updating weights when all training images are correctly classified.
This is the problem of the early saturation. This paper proposes a novel cost
function, called mixture separability loss (MSL), which updates the weights of
the network even when most of the training images are accurately predicted. MSL
consists of between-class and within-class loss. Between-class loss maximizes
the differences between inter-class images, whereas within-class loss minimizes
the similarities between intra-class images. We designed the proposed loss
function to attach to different convolutional layers in the network in order to
utilize intermediate feature maps. Experiments show that a network with MSL
deepens the learning process and obtains promising results with some public

processing and low-level vision. Recently, sophisticated priors such as dark
channel prior, extreme channel prior, and local maximum gradient prior, have
shown promising effectiveness. However, these methods are computationally
expensive. Meanwhile, since these priors involved subproblems cannot be solved
explicitly, approximate solution is commonly used, which limits the best
exploitation of their capability. To address these problems, this work firstly
proposes a simplified sparsity prior of local minimal pixels, namely patch-wise
minimal pixels (PMP). The PMP of clear images is much more sparse than that of
blurred ones, and hence is very effective in discriminating between clear and
blurred images. Then, a novel algorithm is designed to efficiently exploit the
sparsity of PMP in deblurring. The new algorithm flexibly imposes sparsity
inducing on the PMP under the MAP framework rather than directly uses the half
quadratic splitting algorithm. By this, it avoids non-rigorous approximation
solution in existing algorithms, while being much more computationally
efficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can
achieve better practical stability compared with state-of-the-arts. In terms of
deblurring quality, robustness and computational efficiency, the new algorithm
is superior to state-of-the-arts. Code for reproducing the results of the new
method is available at https://github.com/FWen/deblur-pmp.git.

model which captures TPM's protections on keys and protocols' computation

Based on the unified security model, we give the first formal security analysis

with the help of hardware protections of TPM chips, the key exchange primitive
indeed satisfies the well-defined security property of our security model, but
unfortunately under some impractical limiting conditions, which would prevent

TPM 2.0 applicable to real-world networks, we present a revision of the key

in confined flow channels. Its physical origin can be attributed to the
intermolecular fluid-solid (F-S) interaction force. To this end, we propose
herein continuous force functions (decaying either exponentially or by a power
law) between fluid particles and two confined flat walls in the framework of
the mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann model (LBM). The analytical solutions for
density profile, velocity profile, slip length, and permeability ratio are
derived and related to the mesoscale F-S interaction parameters and the size of
the gap of the flow channel. Through nondimensionalization of the analytical
solutions, we obtain the dimensionless numbers that indicate the key feature of
slip-flow systems for each of the proposed force functions. The analytical
solutions are strictly consistent with the LBM solutions. We suggest reasonable
ranges for the F-S interaction parameters based on the observed range of
density ratio (film fluid to bulk fluid) and the increasing permeability ratios
with narrowing gap size. Within the given range of interaction parameters,
simple relationships between permeability ratios and dimensionless numbers are
provided by fitting. The curves for continuous F-S interaction force with two
free parameters are calibrated for a hydrophobic surface by using LBM
simulations, which were validated a priori by comparison with the slip velocity
profile measured in a benchmark flow experiment. The mesoscopic LBM model based
on the proposed F-S interaction force functions provides a robust framework to
elucidate the physical process of liquid slip flow.

unlike the training. For example, it is not hard to enlarge the 40GB WebText
used for training GPT-2 by modifying its sampling methodology considering how
many webpages there are in the Internet. On the other hand, given that training
on this dataset already costs tens of thousands of dollars, training on a
larger dataset naively is not cost-wise feasible. In this paper, we suggest to
train on a larger dataset for only one epoch unlike the current practice, in
which the unsupervised models are trained for from tens to hundreds of epochs.
Furthermore, we suggest to adjust the model size and the number of iterations
to be performed appropriately. We show that the performance of Transformer
language model becomes dramatically improved in this way, especially if the
original number of epochs is greater. For example, by replacing the training
for 10 epochs with the one epoch training, this translates to 1.9-3.3x speedup
in wall-clock time in our settings and more if the original number of epochs is
greater. Under one epoch training, no overfitting occurs, and regularization
method does nothing but slows down the training. Also, the curve of test loss
over iterations follows power-law extensively. We compare the wall-clock time
of the training of models with different parameter budget under one epoch
training, and we show that size/iteration adjustment based on our proposed
heuristics leads to 1-2.7x speedup in our cases. With the two methods combined,
we achieve 3.3-5.1x speedup. Finally, we speculate various implications of one
epoch training and size/iteration adjustment. In particular, based on our
analysis we believe that we can reduce the cost to train the state-of-the-art
models as BERT and GPT-2 dramatically, maybe even by the factor of 10.

MGRIT convergence, this paper proves (or disproves) $h_x$- and
$h_t$-independent convergence of two-level Parareal and MGRIT, for linear
problems of the form $\mathbf{u}'(t) + \mathcal{L}\mathbf{u}(t) = f(t)$, where
$\mathcal{L}$ is symmetric positive definite and Runge-Kutta time integration
is used. The theory presented in this paper also encompasses analysis of some
modified Parareal algorithms, such as the $\theta$-Parareal method, and shows
that not all Runge-Kutta schemes are equal from the perspective of
parallel-in-time. Some schemes, particularly L-stable methods, offer
significantly better convergence than others as they are guaranteed to converge
rapidly at both limits of small and large $h_t\xi$, where $\xi$ denotes an
eigenvalue of $\mathcal{L}$ and $h_t$ time-step size. On the other hand, some
schemes do not obtain $h$-optimal convergence, and two-level convergence is
restricted to certain regimes. In certain cases, an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ factor
change in time step $h_t$ or coarsening factor $k$ can be the difference
between convergence factors $\rho\approx0.02$ and divergence! The analysis is
extended to skew symmetric operators as well, which cannot obtain
$h$-independent convergence and, in fact, will generally not converge for a
sufficiently large number of time steps. Numerical results confirm the analysis
in practice and emphasize the importance of a priori analysis in choosing an
effective coarse-grid scheme and coarsening factor. A Mathematica notebook to
perform a priori two-grid analysis is available at

convergence of the state trajectories to an ultimate bound around the origin
with size increasing with the magnitude of the disturbances. Performing a
suitable change of coordinates, the latter result can be used to design a
controller that is able to track reference trajectories that are solutions of
the unperturbed fractional-order system. To overcome the challenges associated
with the generation of such solutions, we address the practical case where the
references to be tracked are generated as a solution of a specific
finite-dimensional approximation of the original fractional-order system. In
this case, the tracking error trajectory is driven to an asymptotic bound that
is increasing with the magnitude of the disturbances and decreases with the
increment in the accuracy of the approximation. The proposed controllers are
finite-dimensional, in the sense that the computation of the control input only
requires a finite number of previous state and input vectors of the system.
Numerical simulations illustrate the proposed design methods in different
scenarios.

primarily concerned with fundamental limits when the transmitter wishes to
communicate to legitimate receiver(s) while ensuring that the communication is
not detected by an adversary. This paper, however, considers an alternative,
and no less important, setting in which the object to be masked is the state of
the compound channel. Such a communication model has applications in the
prevention of malicious parties seeking to jam the communication signal when,
for example, the signal-to-noise ratio of a wireless channel is found to be
low. Our main contribution is the establishment of bounds on the throughput-key
region when the covertness constraint is defined in terms of the total
variation distance. In addition, for the scenario in which the key length is
infinite, we provide a sufficient condition for when the bounds coincide for
the scaling of the throughput, which follows the square-root law. Numerical

Usually, a ""scanning-and-transmitting"" program is adopted to compensate

compensation but may cost plenty of time in stopping and calibrating processes,
resulting in reduced efficiency in key transmission. Here we for the first
propose to employ a well known machine learning model, i.e., the Long

variations in advance and actively perform real-time control on corresponding
QKD devices. Experimentally, we take the phase-coding scheme as an example and
run the LSTM model based QKD system for more than 10 days. Experimental results
show that we can keep the same level of quantum-bit error rate as the
traditional ""scanning-and-transmitting"" program by employing our new machine
learning method, but dramatically reducing the scanning time and resulting in
significantly enhanced key transmission efficiency. Furthermore, our present
machine learning model should also be applicable to any other QKD systems using

  Pre-selection","SCAI 2019 workshop paper",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background Based Conversations (BBCs) have been developed to make dialogue
systems generate more informative and natural responses by leveraging
background knowledge. Existing methods for BBCs can be grouped into two
categories: extraction-based methods and generation-based methods. The former
extract spans frombackground material as responses that are not necessarily
natural. The latter generate responses thatare natural but not necessarily
effective in leveraging background knowledge. In this paper, we focus on
generation-based methods and propose a model, namely Context-aware Knowledge
Pre-selection (CaKe), which introduces a pre-selection process that uses
dynamic bi-directional attention to improve knowledge selection by using the
utterance history context as prior information to select the most relevant
background material. Experimental results show that our model is superior to
current state-of-the-art baselines, indicating that it benefits from the
pre-selection process, thus improving in-formativeness and fluency.

In this theory, larger derivatives are attributed to the changes in

In this paper, we utilize exponentiated local derivatives (with an exponent
{\gamma}) of an observed image to generate its structure map and texture map.
The structure map is produced by been amplified with {\gamma} > 1, while the
texture map is generated by been shrank with {\gamma} < 1. To this end, we
design exponential filters for the local derivatives, and present their

employed to regularize the illumination and reflectance components in Retinex

further proposed for illumination and reflectance decomposition of a single
image. We solve the STAR model by an alternating optimization algorithm. Each
sub-problem is transformed into a vectorized least squares regression, with
closed-form solutions. Comprehensive experiments on commonly tested datasets
demonstrate that, the proposed STAR model produce better quantitative and

hindered by the difficulty in ensuring plausibility encompassing correct

the significant topological variations of 3D objects even within the same

part composition and placement, we propose to model 3D shape variations with a
part-aware deep generative network, coined as PAGENet. The network is composed
of an array of per-part VAE-GANs, generating semantic parts composing a
complete shape, followed by a part assembly module that estimates a
transformation for each part to correlate and assemble them into a plausible
structure. Through delegating the learning of part composition and part
placement into separate networks, the difficulty of modeling structural
variations of 3D shapes is greatly reduced. We demonstrate through both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations that PAGENet generates 3D shapes with
plausible, diverse and detailed structure, and show two applications, i.e.,
semantic shape segmentation and part-based shape editing.

circumvent the efficient classical simulations based on losses. To achieve our
result we obtain new intermediate results that can be of independent interest.

encode the dataset into different code lengths, existing methods need to train
several models, where each model can only produce a specific code length. This
incurs a considerable training time cost, and largely reduces the flexibility
of quantization methods to be deployed in real applications. To address this
issue, we propose a Deep Recurrent Quantization (DRQ) architecture which can
generate sequential binary codes. To the end, when the model is trained, a
sequence of binary codes can be generated and the code length can be easily
controlled by adjusting the number of recurrent iterations. A shared codebook
and a scalar factor is designed to be the learnable weights in the deep
recurrent quantization block, and the whole framework can be trained in an

respectively for describing the center of mass and intrinsic motions of

firstly deduced the general energy and line broadening size-dependence of

plasmon resonance in a metallic nanosphere originates from the transition of
the first excited state to the ground state of the center of mass subsystem
with energy levels corrected by degenerate state pairs of the system composed
of the center of mass and intrinsic motions of conduction electrons. Then, we
implemented this generation mechanism of additional surface plasmon resonances

successfully explained the extraordinarily large energy blueshifts of localized

allows us to know its action over any quantum state. Here, we propose a
protocol to obtain an approximation of the eigenvectors of an arbitrary
Hermitian quantum operator. This protocol is based on measurement and feedback
processes, which characterize a reinforcement learning protocol. Our proposal
is composed of two systems, a black box named environment and a quantum state
named agent. The role of the environment is to change any quantum state by a
unitary matrix $\hat{U}_E=e^{-i\tau\hat{\mathcal{O}}_E}$ where
$\hat{\mathcal{O}}_E$ is a Hermitian operator, and $\tau$ is a real parameter.
The agent is a quantum state which adapts to some eigenvector of
$\hat{\mathcal{O}}_E$ by repeated interactions with the environment, feedback
process, and semi-random rotations. With this proposal, we can obtain an
approximation of the eigenvectors of a random qubit operator with average
fidelity over 90\% in less than 10 iterations, and surpass 98\% in less than
300 iterations. Moreover, for the two-qubit cases, the four eigenvectors are
obtained with fidelities above 89\% in 8000 iterations for a random operator,
and fidelities of $99\%$ for an operator with the Bell states as eigenvectors.
This protocol can be useful to implement semi-autonomous quantum devices which
should be capable of extracting information and deciding with minimal resources
and without human intervention.

  Evaluation from Boundary Detection","ACL 2019",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The common practice in coreference resolution is to identify and evaluate the
maximum span of mentions. The use of maximum spans tangles coreference
evaluation with the challenges of mention boundary detection like prepositional
phrase attachment. To address this problem, minimum spans are manually
annotated in smaller corpora. However, this additional annotation is costly and
therefore, this solution does not scale to large corpora. In this paper, we
propose the MINA algorithm for automatically extracting minimum spans to
benefit from minimum span evaluation in all corpora. We show that the extracted
minimum spans by MINA are consistent with those that are manually annotated by
experts. Our experiments show that using minimum spans is in particular
important in cross-dataset coreference evaluation, in which detected mention
boundaries are noisier due to domain shift. We will integrate MINA into
https://github.com/ns-moosavi/coval for reporting standard coreference scores

atmospheric drag and the oblateness $J_2$ of the central body are calculated

orientation of the primary's spin axis $\boldsymbol{\hat{S}}$. They provide us
with further observables which could be fruitfully used, e.g., in better
characterizing astrophysical binary systems and in more accurate
satellite-based tests around major bodies of the Solar System. Some erroneous
and misleading claims by Ciufolini and Pavlis appeared in the literature are
confuted. In particular, it is shown that there are no net perturbations of the
Lense-Thirring acceleration on either the semimajor axis $a$ and the mean

extended temporal interval for the data analysis is assumed. A possible use of

general relativity with the existing LAGEOS and LAGEOS II satellites is

Specifically, we consider a two-stage sampling design in which the primary
units are geographic regions, the secondary units are point-referenced
locations, and the measured values are assumed to be a partial realization of a
spatial process. Estimation of finite population quantities from geostatistical
models do not account for sampling designs, which can impair inferential
performance, while design-based estimates ignore the spatial dependence in the
finite population. We demonstrate using simulation experiments that
process-based finite population sampling models improve model fit and inference
over models that fail to account for spatial correlation. Furthermore, the
process based models offer richer inference with spatially interpolated maps
over the entire region. We reinforce these improvements and demonstrate

temporally stable and the flux is found to correlate well with indicators of
star formation rates, such as the total infrared (IR) luminosity $L_{\rm IR}$
and monochromatic radio continuum luminosity at 1.4 GHz $L_{\rm 1.4\ GHz}$,
i.e., following $L_{\gamma}-L_{\rm IR}$ and $L_{\gamma}-L_{\rm 1.4\ GHz}$
relations. Recently, gamma-ray excesses are reported to be spatially coincident
with two starburst galaxies NGC 3424 and UGC 11041 in the fourth \textsl{Fermi}
Large Area Telescope (LAT) source catalog (4FGL). Different from other
starburst galaxies detected by \textsl{Fermi}-LAT, we find that the gamma-ray
emission associated with NGC 3424 and UGC 11041 show significant flux
variability. With relatively weak infrared and radio emission, NGC 3424 and UGC
11041 appear as outliers of the $L_{\gamma}-L_{\rm IR}$ and $L_{\gamma}-L_{\rm
1.4\ GHz}$ relations of starburst galaxies. These results suggest that NGC 3424
and UGC 11041 may harbor obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the AGN
activities provide the dominant contribution to the gamma-ray emission as
compared to that provided by the starburst activities.

performance, together with the near diffraction-limited performance for
532${\,}$nm light makes this design useful for both quantum gas microscopes and

presence of inactive areas between the detector blocks which degrade the image
spatial resolution and leads to streaking artifacts especially when we employ
analytical image reconstruction. The aim of this study is to assess the
feasibility of generating the gap-free PET image using the deep convolutional
encoder-decoder in sinogram space. The gap-corrupted sinograms of simulated
HRRT scanner, sinograms without gaps as ideal/ground truth and predicted
sinograms owing to the implemented our deep-fill method were quantitatively
compared. In total, 1293 phantom images divided into three main sets of
training 1000, 150 Validation, and 143 test set. The 1000 training images were
augmented using affine transformations with various sub-transforms including
rotation (rotate randomly), translation to 12000 Image with 6 frequencies of 2
main methods. The Deep-Fill architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder
part, and it is composed of convolution operation, max pooling, ReLU
activation, concatenation, and up convolution layers. The gap image is going
through the network along with all possible paths then the gap-free image was
generated by decoder part of the network. The quality of the generated images
was quantitatively assessed by different quality metrics in both sinogram space
and reconstruction images. We demonstrated that deep learning based approaches
applied to inter-detector gap filling can recover the missing data in sinogram
with high quantitative accuracy and have the potential to significantly improve
the reconstructed image quality and prevent degradation of PET image
quantification.

surface types is discussed based on the USGS /ASTER spectral library and
principal component analysis (PCA). A new spectral reconstructed model is
proposed by the information of several typical bands instead of all of the
wavelength bands, and a linear combination spectral reconstruction model is
also discussed. By selecting 4 typical spectral datasets including green
vegetation, bare soil, rangeland and concrete in the spectral range of 400-900
nm, the PCA results show that 6 principal components could characterized the
spectral dataset, and the relative reconstructed errors are smaller than 2%. If
only 6-7 selected typical bands are employed to spectral reconstruction for all
the surface reflectance in 400-900 nm, except that the reconstructed error of
green vegetation is about 3.3%, the relative errors of other 3 datasets are all
smaller than 1.6%. The correlation coefficients of those 4 datasets are all
larger than 0.99, which can effectively satisfy the needs of spectral
reconstruction. In addition, based on the spectral library and the linear
combination model of 4 common used bands of satellite remote sensing such as
490, 555, 670 and 865 nm, the reconstructed errors are smaller than 8.5% in
high reflectance region and smaller than 1.5% in low reflectance region
respectively, which basically meet the needs of spectral reconstruction. This
study can provide a reference value for the surface reflectance processing and
spectral reconstruction in satellite remote sensing research.

uses reinforcement learning principles for the determination of optimal control
solutions and deep Neural Networks for approximating the value function and the
control policy. Recent applications have shown that DRL may achieve superhuman
performance in complex cognitive tasks.
  In this work, we show that using restricted, localized actuations, partial
knowledge of the state based on limited sensor measurements, and model-free DRL
controllers, it is possible to stabilize the dynamics of the KS system around
its unstable fixed solutions, here considered as target states. The robustness
of the controllers is tested by considering several trajectories in the
phase-space emanating from different initial conditions; we show that the DRL
is always capable of driving and stabilizing the dynamics around the target
states.
  The complexity of the KS system, the possibility of defining the DRL control
policies by solely relying on the local measurements of the system, and their
efficiency in controlling its nonlinear dynamics pave the way for the
application of RL methods in control of complex fluid systems such as turbulent
boundary layers, turbulent mixers or multiphase flows.
