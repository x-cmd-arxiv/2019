assigning codes as short as possible to numbers. Here we consider the problem
of optimal coding -- under an arbitrary coding scheme -- and show that it
predicts Zipf's law of abbreviation, namely a tendency in natural languages for
more frequent words to be shorter. We apply this result to investigate optimal
coding also under so-called non-singular coding, a scheme where unique
segmentation is not warranted but codes stand for a distinct number. Optimal
non-singular coding predicts that the length of a word should grow
approximately as the logarithm of its frequency rank, which is again consistent
with Zipf's law of abbreviation. Optimal non-singular coding in combination
with the maximum entropy principle also predicts Zipf's rank-frequency
distribution. Furthermore, our findings on optimal non-singular coding
challenge common beliefs about random typing. It turns out that random typing
is in fact an optimal coding process, in stark contrast with the common
assumption that it is detached from cost cutting considerations. Finally, we
discuss the implications of optimal coding for the construction of a compact
theory of Zipfian laws and other linguistic laws.

be cast as modeling the likelihood of pairwise relationship between two nodes.
For example, the goal of author identification task is to model the likelihood
of a paper being written by an author (paper-author pairwise relationship).
Existing task-guided embedding methods are node-centric in that they simply
measure the similarity between the node embeddings to compute the likelihood of
a pairwise relationship between two nodes. However, we claim that for
task-guided embeddings, it is crucial to focus on directly modeling the
pairwise relationship. In this paper, we propose a novel task-guided pair
embedding framework in heterogeneous network, called TaPEm, that directly
models the relationship between a pair of nodes that are related to a specific
task (e.g., paper-author relationship in author identification). To this end,
we 1) propose to learn a pair embedding under the guidance of its associated
context path, i.e., a sequence of nodes between the pair, and 2) devise the
pair validity classifier to distinguish whether the pair is valid with respect
to the specific task at hand. By introducing pair embeddings that capture the
semantics behind the pairwise relationships, we are able to learn the
fine-grained pairwise relationship between two nodes, which is paramount for
task-guided embedding methods. Extensive experiments on author identification
task demonstrate that TaPEm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods,
especially for authors with few publication records.

surrounding AI have attracted increasing attention. In particular, autonomous

course resulting in hurting pedestrians or swerving leading to hurting
passengers. To investigate such ethical dilemmas, recent studies have adopted
preference aggregation, in which each voter expresses her/his preferences over
decisions for the possible ethical dilemma scenarios, and a centralized system
aggregates these preferences to obtain the winning decision. Although a useful
methodology for building ethical AI systems, such an approach can potentially
violate the privacy of voters since moral preferences are sensitive information
and their disclosure can be exploited by malicious parties. In this paper, we
report a first-of-its-kind privacy-preserving crowd-guided AI decision-making
approach in ethical dilemmas. We adopt the notion of differential privacy to
quantify privacy and consider four granularities of privacy protection by
taking voter-/record-level privacy protection and centralized/distributed
perturbation into account, resulting in four approaches VLCP, RLCP, VLDP, and
RLDP. Moreover, we propose different algorithms to achieve these privacy
protection granularities, while retaining the accuracy of the learned moral
preference model. Specifically, VLCP and RLCP are implemented with the data
aggregator setting a universal privacy parameter and perturbing the averaged
moral preference to protect the privacy of voters' data. VLDP and RLDP are
implemented in such a way that each voter perturbs her/his local moral
preference with a personalized privacy parameter. Extensive experiments on both

cohort, the mean [min-max] allowable motion for 33/40/50 Gy to the PTV was 11.9
[6.3-22.4], 10.4 [5.2-19.1] and 9.0 [4.2-16.0] mm, respectively. Maximum
allowable motion decreased as dose was escalated, and was smaller in patients
with larger tumors. The effects of motion on pancreatic SBRT are highly
variable between patients and there is potential to allow more motion in
certain patients, even in dose-escalated scenarios. In our dataset, a
conservative limit of 6.3 mm would ensure safe treatment of all patients
treated to 33 Gy in 5 fractions.

large-scale real-time simulation and planning for autonomous driving. GAMMA
models heterogeneous, interactive traffic agents. They operate under diverse
road conditions, with various geometric and kinematic constraints. GAMMA treats
the prediction task as constrained optimization in traffic agents' velocity
space. The objective is to optimize an agent's driving performance, while
obeying all the constraints resulting from the agent's kinematics, collision
avoidance with other agents, and the environmental context. Further, GAMMA
explicitly conditions the prediction on human behavioral states as parameters
of the optimization model, in order to account for versatile human behaviors.
We evaluated GAMMA on a set of real-world benchmark datasets. The results show
that GAMMA achieves high prediction accuracy on both homogeneous and
heterogeneous traffic datasets, with sub-millisecond execution time. Further,
the computational efficiency and the flexibility of GAMMA enable (i) simulation
of mixed urban traffic at many locations worldwide and (ii) planning for
autonomous driving in dense traffic with uncertain driver behaviors, both in
real-time. The open-source code of GAMMA is available online.

first techniques for unbounded SAT-based Model Checking (SMC). While elegant
and simple to apply, properties as such are rarely k-inductive and when they
can be strengthened, there is no effective strategy to guess the depth of
induction. It has been mostly displaced by techniques that compute inductive
strengthenings based on interpolation and property directed reachability (Pdr).
In this paper, we present kAvy, an SMC algorithm that effectively uses
k-induction to guide interpolation and Pdr-style inductive generalization.
Unlike pure k-induction, kAvy uses Pdr-style generalization to compute and
strengthen an inductive trace. Unlike pure Pdr, kAvy uses relative k-induction
to construct an inductive invariant. The depth of induction is adjusted
dynamically by minimizing a proof of unsatisfiability. We have implemented kAvy
within the Avy Model Checker and evaluated it on HWMCC instances. Our results
show that kAvy is more effective than both Avy and Pdr, and that using
k-induction leads to faster running time and solving more instances. Further,
on a class of benchmarks, called shift, kAvy is orders of magnitude faster than
Avy, Pdr and k-induction.

needs to incorporate an absorbing source grating. In order to attain good

stringent condition. In literature some authors claim that the Lau-condition in
Talbot-Lau interferometry can be literally transferred to dual phase grating

overcome this dilemma, the notion of d\'evissage spaces should not be expressed

infrared modifications of gravity, bigravity theories and the corresponding
phenomenon of GW oscillation, as well as theories with extra or varying

phenomenon in modified gravity. We then use a simple parametrization of the
effect in terms of two parameters $(\Xi_0,n)$, that is shown to fit well the

modified GW propagation using supermassive black hole binaries as standard

Galactic neutron stars accreting from a Be-star companion at super-Eddington

approach to study outflows in this accretion regime. Here, we present Chandra
high-resolution spectroscopy of such a super-Eddington accreting neutron star,
Swift J0243.6+6124, to search for wind outflow signatures during the peak of
its 2017/2018 giant outburst. We detect narrow emission features at rest from
Ne, Mg, S, Si, and Fe. In addition, we detect a collection of absorption
features which can be identified in two ways: either as all Fe transitions at
rest (with a possible contribution from Mg), or a combination of three
blue-shifted Ne and Mg lines at $\sim 0.22c$, while the remaining lines are at
rest. The second scenario would imply an outflow with a velocity similar to
those seen in ULXs, including the ULX pulsar NGC 300 ULX-1. This result would
also imply that Swift J0243.6+6124 launches both a jet, detected in radio and

algorithms for estimating graph motif counts. Those algorithms, however, are
not yet capable of scaling well to very large graphs with billions of edges. In
this paper we develop novel tools for the `motif counting via color coding'
framework. As a result, our new algorithm, Motivo, is able to scale well to
larger graphs while at the same time provide more accurate graphlet counts than
ever before. This is achieved thanks to two types of improvements. First, we
design new succinct data structures that support fast common color coding
operations, and a biased coloring trick that trades accuracy versus running
time and memory usage. These adaptations drastically reduce the time and memory
requirements of color coding. Second, we develop an adaptive graphlet sampling
strategy, based on a fractional set cover problem, that breaks the additive
approximation barrier of standard sampling. This strategy gives multiplicative
approximations for all graphlets at once, allowing us to count not only the
most frequent graphlets but also extremely rare ones.
  To give an idea of the improvements, in $40$ minutes Motivo counts $7$-nodes
motifs on a graph with $65$M nodes and $1.8$B edges; this is $30$ and $500$
times larger than the state of the art, respectively in terms of nodes and
edges. On the accuracy side, in one hour Motivo produces accurate counts of
$\approx \! 10.000$ distinct $8$-node motifs on graphs where state-of-the-art
algorithms fail even to find the second most frequent motif. Our method
requires just a high-end desktop machine. These results show how color coding

investigated here by a new insight rather than conventional perturbative QCD
(pQCD). For this purpose we note that the solution of the evolution equations
in moment space involves noninteger powers of the coupling constant. Therefore
it is possible to employ a new approach which is called fractional analytical
perturbation theory Consequently, it is possible to remove the Landau
singularities of the renormalized coupling, i.e., at the scales $Q \sim
\Lambda$, using this approach. This provides an opportunity to continue the
desired calculations toward small values of energy scales even less than the
$\Lambda$ scale. To modify the analytical perturbation theory, a newer approach
is introduced, called 2$\delta$anQCD, in which the spectral function of the
holomorphic coupling is parameterized in the low-energy region by two delta
functions. This model gives us more reliable results for the considered QCD
observables, even in the deep infrared region. We calculate the nonsinglet part
of the polarized nucleon structure function, using the 2$\delta$anQCD model,
and compare it with the result from the underlying pQCD where both are in a new
defined scheme, called the Lambert scheme. For this purpose we employ the anQCD
package in the \textit{Mathematica} environment to establish the analytic
(holomorphic) coupling constant. The results at various energy scales are also
compared with the available experimental data, and it turns out that there is a
good consistency between them. The results show that the obtained nucleon
structure function at small energy scales has smoother behavior when using the
2$\delta$anQCD model than the underlying pQCD. In fact the coupling constant in
analytic QCD behaves moderately and it makes the result approach the available
data in a better way.

follows from the requirement of quantum Weyl invariance in the absence of

has interesting consequences, in particular it yields a mass term and an

first-principles quantum molecular dynamics calculations based on this theory
were presented for representative materials and conditions. We first derive a
general expression for the electron-ion coupling factor that includes
self-consistently the quantum mechanical and statistical nature of electrons,
the thermal and disorder effects, and the correlations between particles. We
show that our theory reduces to well-known models in limiting cases. In
particular, we show that it simplifies to the standard electron-phonon coupling
formula in the limit of hot solids with lattice and electronic temperatures
much greater than the Debye temperature, and that it extends the
electron-phonon coupling formula beyond the harmonic phonon approximation. For
plasmas, we show that the theory readily reduces to well-know Spitzer formula
in the hot plasma limit, to the Fermi golden rule formula in the limit of weak
electron-ion interactions, and to other models proposed to go beyond the latter
approximation. We explain that the electron-ion coupling is particularly well
adapted to averaged atom models, which offer an effective way to include
non-ideal interaction effects to the standard models and at a much reduced

the $M^\prime$ location loses its spectral strength without any shift. With the
inclusion of DM interaction the spiral phase is more stable and the peak at

their closest filament's axis and walls, while low mass halos tend to have
their spins parallel to filaments and in the plane of walls. A similar
mass-dependent spin flip is found for galaxies, albeit with a weaker signal
particularly at low mass and low-z, suggesting that galaxies' spins retain
memory of their larger-scale environment. Low-z star-forming and
rotation-dominated galaxies tend to have spins parallel to nearby filaments,
while quiescent and dispersion-dominated galaxies show preferentially
perpendicular orientation; the star formation trend can be fully explained by
the stellar mass correlation, but the morphology trend cannot. There is a
strong dependence on HI mass, such that high-HI galaxies tend to have parallel
spins while low-HI galaxies are perpendicular, which persists even when
matching samples in stellar mass, suggesting that HI content traces anisotropic
infall more faithfully than the stellar component. Finally, at fixed stellar
mass, the strength of spin alignments correlates with the filament's density,
with parallel alignment for galaxies in high density environments. These
findings are consistent with conditional tidal torque theory, and highlight a
significant correlation between galactic spin and the larger scale tides that
are important e.g. for interpreting weak lensing studies. SIMBA allows us to
rule out numerical grid locking as the cause of previously-seen low mass
alignment.

for the purposes of early stopping or hyperparameter tuning is costly and often
practically infeasible. This leads us to examine off-policy policy evaluation
(OPE) in such settings. We focus on OPE for value-based methods, which are of
particular interest in deep RL, with applications like robotics, where
off-policy algorithms based on Q-function estimation can often attain better
sample complexity than direct policy optimization. Existing OPE metrics either
rely on a model of the environment, or the use of importance sampling (IS) to
correct for the data being off-policy. However, for high-dimensional
observations, such as images, models of the environment can be difficult to fit
and value-based methods can make IS hard to use or even ill-conditioned,
especially when dealing with continuous action spaces. In this paper, we focus
on the specific case of MDPs with continuous action spaces and sparse binary
rewards, which is representative of many important real-world applications. We
propose an alternative metric that relies on neither models nor IS, by framing
OPE as a positive-unlabeled (PU) classification problem with the Q-function as
the decision function. We experimentally show that this metric outperforms
baselines on a number of tasks. Most importantly, it can reliably predict the
relative performance of different policies in a number of generalization
scenarios, including the transfer to the real-world of policies trained in

ratio from the literature and an isotropic profile, the agreement with the data
is excellent near the center of the galaxy. However, in modified gravity, close
to the cluster core, the gravitational environment should bring the galaxy back
towards the Newtonian behavior. This success of the isolated MOND prediction
for the central velocity dispersion could then mean that the galaxy is at large
distances ($\gg5$ Mpc) from the cluster core, as hinted by the fact that
close-by UDGs share similar velocities with a dispersion well below that of the
cluster itself. There is however a two-sigma tension in the outer part of the
UDG due to an increase of the observed dispersion profile with respect to the
flat MOND prediction. This deviation could simply be a measurement error. Other
possibilities could be, for a UDG far from the cluster, a higher-than-nominal
baryonic mass with a tangentially anisotropic dispersion profile, or even a
sign of a dark baryonic halo. If the UDG is closer to the cluster core, the
deviation could be a sign that it is in the process of disruption.

Gaia DR2, AllWISE, and GAMA catalogues. We have built and make available to the

of $\approx6$ millions of sources classified as quasars ($\approx 200\,000$)

'Multiplets': close pairs of quasars or galaxies surrounded by at least one

further explored in a forthcoming paper. We compared our search to the previous

importance in collider physics. Efficient and robust techniques for quark
versus gluon jet discrimination have consequences for new physics searches,
precision $\alpha_s$ studies, parton distribution function extractions, and
many other applications. Numerous machine learning analyses have attacked the
problem, demonstrating that good performance can be obtained but generally not
providing an understanding for what properties of the jets are responsible for
that separation power. In this paper, we provide an extensive and detailed
analysis of quark versus gluon discrimination from first-principles theoretical
calculations. Working in the strongly-ordered soft and collinear limits, we
calculate probability distributions for fixed $N$-body kinematics within jets
with up through three resolved emissions (${\cal O}(\alpha_s^3)$). This enables
explicit calculation of quantities central to machine learning such as the
likelihood ratio, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve,
and reducibility factors within a well-defined approximation scheme. Further,
we relate the existence of a consistent power counting procedure for
discrimination to ideas for operational flavor definitions, and we use this
relationship to construct a power counting for quark versus gluon
discrimination as an expansion in $e^{C_F-C_A}\ll1$, the exponential of the
fundamental and adjoint Casimirs. Our calculations provide insight into the
discrimination performance of particle multiplicity and show how observables
sensitive to all emissions in a jet are optimal. We compare our predictions to
the performance of individual observables and neural networks with parton
shower event generators, validating that our predictions describe the features
identified by machine learning.

galactic nucleus (AGN) torus, an AGN polar dust component, and a starburst. The
starburst dominates the infrared emission with a luminosity of
log($L_\textrm{SB}[\textrm{L}_\odot]) = 12.91^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, implying a star
formation rate of about 2000 $\textrm{M}_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, the highest known
among FeLoBAL quasars. The AGN torus and polar dust components are less

40 Myr. We do not find conclusive evidence that the AGN is affecting the CO gas

of a classical quasar.

tidal evolution and survival of subhaloes. In agreement with previous studies,
we show that N-body realisations of cold dark matter subhaloes with
centrally-divergent density cusps form artificial constant-density cores on the
scale of the resolution limit of the simulation. These density cores drive the
artificial tidal disruption of subhaloes. We run controlled simulations of the
tidal evolution of a single subhalo where we repeatedly reconstruct the density
cusp, preventing artificial disruption. This allows us to follow the evolution
of the subhalo for arbitrarily large fractions of tidally stripped mass. Based
on this numerical evidence in combination with simple dynamical arguments, we
argue that cuspy dark matter subhaloes cannot be completely disrupted by smooth
tidal fields. Modelling stars as collisionless tracers of the underlying
potential, we furthermore study the tidal evolution of Milky Way dwarf
spheroidal galaxies. Using a model of the Tucana III dwarf as an example, we
show that tides can strip dwarf galaxies down to sub-solar luminosities. The

The environmental differences are statistically significant even after we
control for galaxy mass and morphology. We interpret these observations as a
direct signature of environmentally-caused strangulation. We present a simple,
heuristic model for the effect of a massive parent galaxy. In this model, the
CGM cool gas fraction within 50 kpc is significantly decreased for galaxies
that lie within 700 kpc of a massive galaxy, with about 80\% of the cool gas

sufficiently small initial data, while others do not. The (classical) null
condition guarantees that such a result holds, but it is too strong to capture
certain systems -- most famously the Einstein equations -- which nevertheless
admit global solutions for small initial data. The weak null condition has been
proposed as a sufficient condition for such a result to hold; it takes the form
of a condition on a related set of nonlinear ODEs known as the ""asymptotic
system"". Previous results in this direction have required certain structural
conditions on the asymptotic system in addition to the weak null condition. In
this work we show that, if the solutions to the asymptotic system are bounded
(given small initial data), and, in addition, if these solutions are stable
against rapidly decaying perturbations, then the corresponding system of
nonlinear wave equations admits global solutions for all sufficiently small
initial data. This avoids any direct assumptions on the structure of the
nonlinear terms. We also give an example of a class of systems obeying this
condition but not obeying previously identified structural conditions. For this
class the asymptotic system arises as a generalisation of the ""Euler equations""
for rigid body motion, associated with a left-invariant Hamiltonian flow on a
finite dimensional Lie group. This work relies heavily on the author's previous
work, ""The weak null condition and global existence using the p-weighted energy
method"".

highest weight vectors have two universal properties, which we clearly state in
this paper. Given a soft operator with a certain dimension and spin, the first
property is about the existence of ""(large) gauge transformation"" that acts on
the soft operator. The second property is the decoupling of (large)
gauge-invariant null-states of the soft operators from the $S$-matrix elements.
In each case, the decoupling equation has the form of zero field-strength
condition with the soft operator as the (gauge) potential. Null-state
decoupling effectively reduces the number of polarisation states of the soft
particle and is crucial in deriving soft-theorems from the Ward identities of
asymptotic symmetries. To the best of our understanding, these properties are
not directly related to the Lorentz invariance of the $S$-matrix or the
existence of asymptotic symmetries. We also verify that the results obtained
from the decoupling of null-states are consistent with the leading and
subleading soft-theorems with finite energy massive and massless particles in
the external legs.

of this definition that applies to the genus-one four-graviton Type II
superstring amplitude to all orders in the low-energy expansion. To obtain this
result, the integral over the genus-one moduli space is partitioned into a
region ${\cal M}_R$ surrounding the cusp and its complement ${\cal M}_L$, and
an exact expression is obtained for the contribution to the amplitude from
${\cal M}_R$. The low-energy expansion of the ${\cal M}_R$ contribution is
proven to be free of irreducible multiple zeta-values to all orders. The
contribution to the amplitude from ${\cal M}_L$ is computed in terms of modular
graph functions up to order $D^{12} {\cal R}^4$ in the low-energy expansion,
and general arguments are used beyond this order to conjecture the
transcendentality properties of the ${\cal M}_L$ contributions. Maximal
transcendentality of the full amplitude holds provided we assign a non-zero

in the ELAIS-N1 field in the form of angular power spectrum using the newly

without direction-dependent calibration techniques. We have demonstrated the
effectiveness of TGE against the direction dependent effects by using higher

synchrotron emission (DGSE) dominates the sky, after point source subtraction,

target sequences in solution to surface-immobilized probes. In this process,
the target is usually assumed to be in excess, so that its concentration does
not significantly vary while hybridizing to the surface-bound probes. If the
target is initially at low concentrations and/or if the number of probes is
very large and have high affinity for the target, the DNA in solution may get
depleted. In this paper we analyze the equilibrium and kinetics of
hybridization of DNA biosensors in the case of strong target depletion, by
extending the Langmuir adsorption model. We focus, in particular, on the
detection of a small amount of a single-nucleotide ""mutant"" sequence
(concentration $c_2$) in a solution, which differs by one or more nucleotides
from an abundant ""wild-type"" sequence (concentration $c_1 \gg c_2$). We show
that depletion can give rise to a strongly-enhanced sensitivity of the
biosensors. Using representative values of rate constants and hybridization
free energies, we find that in the depletion regime one could detect relative
concentrations $c_2/c_1$ that are up to three orders of magnitude smaller than
in the conventional approach. The kinetics is surprisingly rich, and exhibits a
non-monotonic adsorption with no counterpart in the no-depletion case. Finally,
we show that, alongside enhanced detection sensitivity, this approach offers
the possibility of sample enrichment, by substantially increasing the relative
amount of the mutant over the wild-type sequence.

known, each one providing its own unique insights. Common to all treatments is
the assumption that neutrinos propagate freely between source and detector, as
indeed they do in all experiments thus far conducted. Here we consider how
neutrinos oscillate when, contrary to the usual set-up, they are bound in a
potential well. The focus in particular is on nonrelativistic neutrinos with
quasi-degenerate masses, for which oscillations in free space are described by
the same formula, to lowest order, as relativistic neutrinos. Trapping these
particles engenders corrections to their oscillation frequencies because the
interference terms are between discrete energy levels rather than continuous
spectra. Especially novel is the frequency shift that occurs due to the
dependence of the energy levels on the mass of the neutrino: this part of the
correction is nonvanishing even in the extremely nonrelativistic limit,
reflecting the fact that the neutrino mass states have different zero-point
energies in the well. Building an apparatus that can trap neutrinos is a
futuristic prospect to say the least, but these calculations nonetheless shine
a light on certain basic aspects of the flavor-oscillation phenomenon.

which consequently leads to traffic congestion and rapid growth of greenhouse
gas emissions. In this work, we focus on achieving sustainable transportation
by incentivizing passengers to switch from private cars to public transport. We
address the following challenges. First, the passengers incur inconvenience
costs when changing their transit behaviors due to delay and discomfort, and
thus need to be reimbursed. Second, the inconvenience cost, however, is unknown
to the government when choosing the incentives. Furthermore, changing transit
behaviors raises privacy concerns from passengers. An adversary could infer
personal information, (e.g., daily routine, region of interest, and wealth), by
observing the decisions made by the government, which are known to the public.
We adopt the concept of differential privacy and propose privacy-preserving
incentive designs under two settings, denoted as two-way communication and
one-way communication. Under two-way communication, passengers submit bids and
then the government determines the incentives, whereas in one-way communication
the government simply sets a price without acquiring information from the
passengers. Under one-way communication, we focus on how the government should
design the incentives without revealing passengers' inconvenience costs while
still preserving differential privacy. We formulate the problem as a convex
program, and propose a differentially private and near-optimal solution
algorithm. A numerical case study using Caltrans Performance Measurement System
(PeMS) data source is presented as evaluation. The results show that the
proposed approaches achieve a win-win situation in which both the government
and passengers obtain non-negative utilities.

performed to understand what they take into account for their decisions,
providing useful insights. An extensive analysis of different categories of

Results show that it is possible to accurately predict when tuning will
significantly improve the performance of the induced models. The proposed
system reduces the time spent on optimization processes, without reducing the
predictive performance of the induced models (when compared with the ones
obtained using tuned hyperparameters). We also explain the decision-making
process of the meta-learners in terms of linear separability-based hypotheses.
Although this analysis is focused on the tuning of Support Vector Machines, it

work proposes using stochastic gradients for efficient generalized canonical
polyadic (GCP) tensor decomposition of large-scale tensors. GCP tensor
decomposition is a recently proposed version of tensor decomposition that
allows for a variety of loss functions such as Bernoulli loss for binary data
or Huber loss for robust estimation. The stochastic gradient is formed from
randomly sampled elements of the tensor and is efficient because it can be
computed using the sparse matricized-tensor-times-Khatri-Rao product (MTTKRP)
tensor kernel. For dense tensors, we simply use uniform sampling. For sparse
tensors, we propose two types of stratified sampling that give precedence to
sampling nonzeros. Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed
approach and its scalability to large-scale problems.

of research. This paper studies the FDR control of the BH procedure when it is
applied to mid p-values and derive conditions under which it is conservative.
Our simulation study reveals that the BH procedure applied to mid p-values may

interdependence of gas with electric power networks call for advanced
computational tools. Solving the equations relating gas injections to pressures
and pipeline flows lies at the heart of natural gas network (NGN) operation,
yet existing solvers require careful initialization and uniqueness has been an
open question. In this context, this work considers the nonlinear steady-state
version of the gas flow (GF) problem. It first establishes that the solution to
the GF problem is unique under arbitrary NGN topologies, compressor types, and
sets of specifications. For GF setups where pressure is specified on a single
(reference) node and compressors do no appear in cycles, the GF task is posed
as an convex minimization. To handle more general setups, a GF solver relying
on a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained quadratic program (MI-QCQP) is
also devised. This solver can be used for any GF setup at any NGN. It
introduces binary variables to capture flow directions; relaxes the pressure
drop equations to quadratic inequality constraints; and uses a carefully
selected objective to promote the exactness of this relaxation. The relaxation
is provably exact in NGNs with non-overlapping cycles and a single
fixed-pressure node. The solver handles efficiently the involved bilinear terms
through McCormick linearization. Numerical tests validate our claims,
demonstrate that the MI-QCQP solver scales well, and that the relaxation is
exact even when the sufficient conditions are violated, such as in NGNs with
overlapping cycles and multiple fixed-pressure nodes.

which associates to the measurements, the minimizing set of some appropriate
performance functions. We consider a family of such performance functions each

shown that the proposed class of estimators enjoys the property of resilience,
that is, it induces an estimation error which, under certain conditions, is
independent of the extreme values of the (impulsive) measurement noise. Hence,
the estimation error may be bounded while the measurement noise is virtually
unbounded. Moreover, we provide several error bounds (in different
configurations) whose expressions depend explicitly on the degree of
observability of the system being observed and on the considered performance
function. Finally, a few simulation results are provided to illustrate the

a vector spherical harmonic decomposition. This enables us to provide a
generalized condition for perfect absorption which occurs when both the
so-called \textit{generalized Kerker condition} is reached and when the

two-dimensional materials that perfectly absorb a plane electromagnetic wave
under normal incidence. One is an infinite array of silica microspheres that
operates at mid-infrared frequencies, while the other is an infinite array of
germanium nano-clusters that operates at visible frequencies. Both systems
operate in a deeply multipolar regime. Our findings are important to the
metamaterials and metasurfaces communities who design materials mainly
restricted to the dipolar behavior of individual resonators, as well as the
self-assembly and nanochemistry communities who separate the individual

more sophisticated and able to represent the dynamics more accurately,
fundamental problems in robotics such as motion planning and perception can be
solved in simulation and solutions transferred to the physical robot. However,
even the most complex simulator might still not be able to represent reality in
all its details either due to inaccurate parametrization or simplistic
assumptions in the dynamic models. BayesSim provides a principled framework to
reason about the uncertainty of simulation parameters. Given a black box
simulator (or generative model) that outputs trajectories of state and action
pairs from unknown simulation parameters, followed by trajectories obtained
with a physical robot, we develop a likelihood-free inference method that
computes the posterior distribution of simulation parameters. This posterior
can then be used in problems where Sim2Real is critical, for example in policy
search. We compare the performance of BayesSim in obtaining accurate posteriors
in a number of classical control and robotics problems. Results show that the

  Evaluation","Accepted by NeurIPS 2019, 6 figures, 10 tables",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Discovery of causal relations from observational data is essential for many
disciplines of science and real-world applications. However, unlike other
machine learning algorithms, whose development has been greatly fostered by a
large amount of available benchmark datasets, causal discovery algorithms are
notoriously difficult to be systematically evaluated because few datasets with
known ground-truth causal relations are available. In this work, we handle the
problem of evaluating causal discovery algorithms by building a flexible
simulator in the medical setting. We develop a neuropathic pain diagnosis
simulator, inspired by the fact that the biological processes of neuropathic
pathophysiology are well studied with well-understood causal influences. Our
simulator exploits the causal graph of the neuropathic pain pathology and its
parameters in the generator are estimated from real-life patient cases. We show
that the data generated from our simulator have similar statistics as
real-world data. As a clear advantage, the simulator can produce infinite
samples without jeopardizing the privacy of real-world patients. Our simulator
provides a natural tool for evaluating various types of causal discovery
algorithms, including those to deal with practical issues in causal discovery,
such as unknown confounders, selection bias, and missing data. Using our
simulator, we have evaluated extensively causal discovery algorithms under
various settings.

for distributed non-convex optimization. Two prominent such algorithms include
signSGD with majority vote, an effective approach for communication reduction
via 1-bit compression on the local gradients, and medianSGD, an algorithm
recently proposed to ensure robustness against Byzantine workers. The
convergence analyses for these algorithms critically rely on the assumption
that all the distributed data are drawn iid from the same distribution.
However, in applications such as Federated Learning, the data across different

local gradients. To overcome this gap, we provide a novel gradient correction
mechanism that perturbs the local gradients with noise, together with a series
results that provable close the gap between mean and median of the gradients.
The proposed methods largely preserve nice properties of these methods, such as
the low per-iteration communication complexity of signSGD, and further enjoy
global convergence to stationary solutions. Our perturbation technique can be

which systematically examined various ways of incorporating geolocation

overcome the situation where no fine-grained dataset has complete geolocation

Comparing several models, we found that best performance was achieved by a
post-processing model that consumed the output of the image-only baseline

performance was better with a feature modulation model that trains jointly over

finite type or cellular automata, are known to be closely related to
computability theory. In particular, the appropriate tools to describe and
classify topological entropy for this kind of systems turned out to be of
computational nature. Part of the great importance of these symbolic systems
relies on the role they have played in understanding more general systems over
non-symbolic spaces. The aim of this article is to investigate topological
entropy from a computability point of view in this more general, not
necessarily symbolic setting. In analogy to effective subshifts, we consider
computable maps over effective compact sets in general metric spaces, and study
the computability properties of their topological entropies. We show that even
in this general setting, the entropy is always a $\Sigma_2$-computable number.
We then study how various dynamical and analytical constrains affect this upper
bound, and prove that it can be lowered in different ways depending on the
constraint considered. In particular, we obtain that all $\Sigma_2$-computable
numbers can already be realized within the class of surjective computable maps
over $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$, but that this bound decreases to $\Pi_{1}$(or
upper)-computable numbers when restricted to expansive maps. On the other hand,
if we change the geometry of the ambient space from the symbolic
$\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ to the unit interval $[0,1]$, then we find a quite
different situation -- we show that the possible entropies of computable
systems over $[0,1]$ are exactly the $\Sigma_{1}$(or lower)-computable numbers
and that this characterization switches down to precisely the computable
numbers when we restrict the class of system to the quadratic family.

temperatures, but they exhibit the capability of depositing a part of their
energy in the chromosphere. This results in up about a five times increase of
ion temperature that takes place there on a time-scale of a few minutes. The
most effective heating corresponds to waveperiods within the range of about

preferable and even state-of-the-art in some applications. Encouraged by this,
in this work, we propose a novel network, called Deep Morphological Network
(DeepMorphNet), capable of doing non-linear morphological operations while
performing the feature learning process by optimizing the structuring elements.
The DeepMorphNets can be trained and optimized end-to-end using traditional
existing techniques commonly employed in the training of deep learning
approaches. A systematic evaluation of the proposed algorithm is conducted
using two synthetic and two traditional image classification datasets. Results
show that the proposed DeepMorphNets is a promising technique that can learn
distinct features when compared to the ones learned by current deep learning
methods.

of iron-based superconductivity. Motivated by the recent angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopic measurements on iron-chalcogenide superconductors,
we investigate the influence of pairing symmetries on the topological surface
state. If the surface Dirac cone becomes gapped in the superconducting phase,
it implies magnetization induced from time-reversal symmetry breaking pairing
via spin-orbit coupling. Based on the crystalline symmetry constraints on the
Ginzburg-Landau free energy, the gap function symmetries are among the
possibilities of $A_{1g(u)}\pm iA_{2g(u)}$, $B_{1g(u)}\pm iB_{2g(u)}$, or,
$E_{g(u)}\pm i E_{g(u)}$. This time-reversal symmetry breaking effect can exist
in the normal state very close to $T_c$ with the relative phase between two gap
functions locked at $\pm \frac{\pi}{2}$. The coupling between magnetization and
superconducting gap functions is calculated based on a three-orbital model for
the band structure of iron-chalcogenides. This study provides the connection
between the gap function symmetries and topological properties of the surface

simple stellar population models, from redshifts $z=0$ to 10. Due to the rapid
fading of young stellar populations in the UV, most of the simulated galaxies
do not host GCs bright enough to be individually identified in deep Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) observations, even in highly magnified systems. The
median age of the most UV-luminous GCs is $<10$ Myr (assuming no extinction),
increasing to $\gtrsim 100$ Myr for red optical filters. We estimate that these
GCs typically only contribute a few per cent of the total UV luminosity of
their host galaxies at any epoch. We predict that the number density of
UV-bright proto-GCs (or cluster clumps) will peak between redshifts $z=1-3$. In
the main progenitors of Milky Way-mass galaxies, $10$-$20$ per cent of the
galaxies at redshifts $1 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$ have clusters brighter than

collecting two valuable datasets: a total of 4,300 group chat channels in Slack
from an R&D department in a multinational IT company; and a total of 117
groups' performance data. Through qualitative coding of 100 randomly sampled
group channels from the 4,300 channels dataset, we identified and reported 9
categories such as Project channels, IT-Support channels, and Event channels.
We further defined a feature metric with 21 meta features (and their derived
features) without looking at the message content to depict the group
communication style for these group chat channels, with which we successfully
trained a machine learning model that can automatically classify a given group
channel into one of the 9 categories. In addition to the descriptive data
analysis, we illustrated how these communication metrics can be used to analyze
team performance. We cross-referenced 117 project teams and their team-based
Slack channels and identified 57 teams that appeared in both datasets, then we
built a regression model to reveal the relationship between these group
communication styles and the project team performance. This work contributes an
updated empirical understanding of human-human communication practices within
the enterprise setting, and suggests design opportunities for the future of

Like conventional coronal holes, the mean magnetic field in each ephemeral
coronal hole displays a consistent polarity, with mean magnetic flux densities

wind data at 1 AU. Further study is needed to determine whether ephemeral
coronal holes are under-reported events or a truly rare phenomenon.

features. We model the watermill by a collection of equally-spaced rigid rods.
Based on the classical resistive force (RF) theory and direct numerical
simulations, we compute the watermill's instantaneous rotational velocity as a
function of its rod number $N$, position and orientation. When $N \geq 4$, the
RF theory predicts that the watermill's rotational velocity is independent of
$N$ and its orientation, implying the full rotational symmetry (of infinity
order), even though the geometrical configuration exhibits a lower-fold
rotational symmetry; the numerical solutions including hydrodynamic
interactions show a weak dependence on $N$ and the orientation. In addition, we
adopt a dynamical system approach to identify the equilibrium positions of the
watermill and analyse their stability. We further compare the theoretically and
numerically derived rotational velocities, which agree with each other in
general, while considerable discrepancy arises in certain configurations owing
to the hydrodynamic interactions neglected by the RF theory. We confirm this
conclusion by employing the RF-based asymptotic framework incorporating
hydrodynamic interactions for a simpler watermill consisting of two or three
rods and we show that accounting for hydrodynamic interactions can
significantly enhance the accuracy of the theoretical predictions.

  Repair",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fault localization is a crucial step of automated program repair, because
accurately identifying program locations that are most closely implicated with
a fault greatly affects the effectiveness of the patching process. An ideal
fault localization technique would provide precise information while requiring
moderate computational resources---to best support an efficient search for
correct fixes. In contrast, most automated program repair tools use standard
fault localization techniques---which are not tightly integrated with the
overall program repair process, and hence deliver only subpar efficiency.
  In this paper, we present retrospective fault localization: a novel fault
localization technique geared to the requirements of automated program repair.
A key idea of retrospective fault localization is to reuse the outcome of
failed patch validation to support mutation-based dynamic analysis---providing
accurate fault localization information without incurring onerous computational
costs.
  We implemented retrospective fault localization in a tool called
RESTORE---based on the JAID Java program repair system. Experiments involving
faults from the Defects4J standard benchmark indicate that retrospective fault
localization can boost automated program repair: RESTORE efficiently explores a
large fix space, delivering state-of-the-art effectiveness (41 Defects4J bugs
correctly fixed, 8 more than any other automated repair tools for Java) while
simultaneously boosting performance (speedup over 3 compared to JAID).
Retrospective fault localization is applicable to any automated program repair
techniques that rely on fault localization and dynamic validation of patches.

($St_{LSM}=0.475$, $St_{VLSM}=0.069$) particles associated with the large-scale
motions (LSMs) and very-large-scale motions (VLSMs) in an open channel flow at
a Reynolds number of $Re_\tau = 550$. One method of filtering the VLSMs from
the flow is via artificial domain truncation, which alters the mean particle
concentration profile and particle clustering due to the removal of VLSMs from
a large domain simulation. In order to exclude possible correlation of the
turbulence introduced by a small domain size with periodic boundary conditions,
low- and high-pass filtering is performed during the simulation to isolate the
particle interaction with different spatial scales. The results show that
particle accumulation and turbophoresis are under-predicted without VLSMs,
whereas the particle clustering and two-way coupling effects are mainly
determined by particle coupling with LSMs. In the inner layer, the elongated
streamwise anisotropic particle clustering can be reproduced by particles
coupling solely with LSMs for low Stokes number ($St_{LSM}=0.0625$) particles.
However, we do not observe similar particle clustering behavior in the outer
layer as seen in the full simulation by coupling particles with either LSMs or
VLSMs for high Stokes number ($St_{VLSM}=0.069$) particles. This indicates that
the organized particle structures are formed by the joint action of LSMs and
VLSMs, especially for high Stokes number particles in the outer layer.

designed to select the corresponding mapping module according to the target

However, these methods require sophisticated techniques and the solutions are
in $k$-space, where the coupling physics that associates the boundary field in
real space and the structure geometry becomes obscure. Moreover, the typical
methods for the analysis of multi-layered hybrid configurations can be
exhaustive due to the complex mode couplings at the interfaces of the layers.
In contrast, an early method can analyze the single-slit transmission for
solutions entirely in real space [F. L. Neerhoff and G. Mur, Appl. Sci. Res.
28, 73 (1973)] by rigorously formulating the field based on Green's theorem and
obtaining two types of the Green's function for the cylindrical wave mode in
free space and the symmetric waveguide modes inside the slit, respectively. In
this article, we advance the method by developing a new type of Green's
function for the asymmetric waveguide modes inside a groove. Since these wave
modes are independent in real space, the coupling physics from the method
becomes straightforward and the solutions are intuitive. With this meticulous
method, we show that complex and multi-layered hybrid configurations can be
easily analyzed with excellent accuracy. In addition, the method demonstrates
the capability of translating the wave interaction problems to analytical

shifts the band edge towards higher energies. This is in good agreement to

  Cross-View Person Re-identification","32 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Person re-identification (person Re-Id) aims to retrieve the pedestrian
images of a same person that captured by disjoint and non-overlapping cameras.
Lots of researchers recently focuse on this hot issue and propose deep learning
based methods to enhance the recognition rate in a supervised or unsupervised
manner. However, two limitations that cannot be ignored: firstly, compared with
other image retrieval benchmarks, the size of existing person Re-Id datasets
are far from meeting the requirement, which cannot provide sufficient
pedestrian samples for the training of deep model; secondly, the samples in
existing datasets do not have sufficient human motions or postures coverage to
provide more priori knowledges for learning. In this paper, we introduce a
novel unsupervised pose augmentation cross-view person Re-Id scheme called
PAC-GAN to overcome these limitations. We firstly present the formal definition
of cross-view pose augmentation and then propose the framework of PAC-GAN that
is a novel conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) based approach to
improve the performance of unsupervised corss-view person Re-Id. Specifically,
The pose generation model in PAC-GAN called CPG-Net is to generate enough
quantity of pose-rich samples from original image and skeleton samples. The
pose augmentation dataset is produced by combining the synthesized pose-rich
samples with the original samples, which is fed into the corss-view person
Re-Id model named Cross-GAN. Besides, we use weight-sharing strategy in the
CPG-Net to improve the quality of new generated samples. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first try to enhance the unsupervised cross-view person
Re-Id by pose augmentation, and the results of extensive experiments show that
the proposed scheme can combat the state-of-the-arts.

identify the polarity expressed in the document about these extracted aspects.
Most existing algorithms address them as two separate tasks and solve them one

Specifically, DOER involves a dual recurrent neural network to extract the

class imbalance issue via running a set of individual deep models for
coarse-to-fine segmentation. Despite its outstanding performance, however, this
method leads to undesired system complexity and also ignores the correlation
among the models. To handle these flaws, we propose a light-weight deep model,
i.e., the One-pass Multi-task Network (OM-Net) to solve class imbalance better
than MC does, while requiring only one-pass computation. First, OM-Net
integrates the separate segmentation tasks into one deep model, which consists
of shared parameters to learn joint features, as well as task-specific
parameters to learn discriminative features. Second, to more effectively
optimize OM-Net, we take advantage of the correlation among tasks to design
both an online training data transfer strategy and a curriculum learning-based
training strategy. Third, we further propose sharing prediction results between
tasks and design a cross-task guided attention (CGA) module which can
adaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses based on the
category-specific statistics. Finally, a simple yet effective post-processing
method is introduced to refine the segmentation results. Extensive experiments
are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most
impressively, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the BraTS 2015 testing

This problem is a great challenge because of complicated interactions among

observed trajectories of all pedestrians to produce a comprehensive description
of the interpersonal interactions. Then the host networks, each of which
corresponds to one pedestrian, consult the description and predict future
trajectories. The star topology gives StarNet two advantages over conventional
models. First, StarNet is able to consider the collective influence among all
pedestrians in the hub network, making more accurate predictions. Second,
StarNet is computationally efficient since the number of host network is linear
to the number of pedestrians. Experiments on multiple public datasets
demonstrate that StarNet outperforms multiple state-of-the-arts by a large
margin in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

staircase growth with time when the system parameter is in the neighborhood of
the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking point. If the system parameter is very
larger than the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking point, the accelerator mode
results in the directed spreading of the wavepackets as well as the ballistic

kicking potential leads to exponentially-fast increase of classical complex
trajectories. As a consequence, the imaginary part of trajectories
exponentially diffuses with time, while the real part exhibits the normal
diffusion. Our analytical prediction of the exponential diffusion of imaginary

The quantum signature of the chaotic diffusion of the complex trajectories is

remarkable sensitivity at room temperature to very small external

its charge state or conformation in response to the absorption of a single

Using the formalism of positive operator values measurements (POVMs), we
analyze the photo-excited electric dipole field and, by extension, the arrival
of a photon based on a measured readout, using a fluorescence cycle, from the
spin center. We determine the jitter time of photon arrival and the probability
of measurement errors. We predict that configuring multiple independent spin

Markov processes from semigroups is shown to be metrically continuous, which
strengthens the sequential weak convergence in the classical approach. Another
new result is a maximal inequality for $L_p$-martingales for $p \ge 1$. In
addition to providing explicit rates of convergence, this maximal inequality
also provides a unified proof of a.u. convergence of martingales, which
previously required separate proofs for the cases $p>1$ and $p=1$. A third new
result is a proof that a familiar condition on the triple-joint distributions

intelligence techniques which substantially reduces acuity exam error over
existing approaches, while also introducing the novel ability to model its own
uncertainty and incorporate prior beliefs. Using standard evaluation metrics,
we estimate a 74% reduction in prediction error compared to the ubiquitous
chart-based eye exam and up to 67% reduction compared to the previous best
digital exam. For patients with eye disease, the novel ability to finely
measure acuity from home could be a crucial part in early diagnosis. We provide
a web implementation of our algorithm for anyone in the world to use. The
insights in this paper also provide interesting implications for the field of
psychometric Item Response Theory.

extended to arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework for simulating the
low-speed continuum and rarefied flows with moving boundaries. For ALE method,
the mesh moving velocity is introduced into the Boltzmann-BGK equation. The
remapping-free scheme is adopted to develop the present ALE-type DUGKS, which
avoids the complex rezoning and remapping process in traditional ALE method. As
in some application areas, the large discretization errors will be introduced
into the simulation if the geometric conservation is not guaranteed. Three
compliant approaches of the geometric conservation law (GCL) are discussed and
a uniform flow test case is conducted to validate these schemes. To illustrate
the performance of present ALE-type DUGKS, four test cases are carried out. Two
of them are the continuum flow cases, which are the flows around the
oscillating circular cylinder and the pitching NACA0012 airfoil, respectively.
Others are the rarefied flow cases, one is the moving piston driven by the
rarefied gas, another is the flow caused by the plate oscillating in its normal
direction. The results of all test cases are in good agreement with the other
numerical and/or experimental results, demonstrating the capability of present
ALE-type DUGKS to cope with the moving boundary problems at different flow
regimes.

superimposed on the long-term period increase tendency is attributed to one
additional object that orbits BH Cas. The low-resolution spectra of this source

changes in the location, temperature, and area of spots on the secondary star

consisting of Ws slots, where Ws >= W and the slot length is equivalent to the
packet length, compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) where at most one

be seen as an attractive approach for uplink transmissions. We derive an
upper-bound on the session error probability as a closed-form expression and

a finger, pacifier, or other object is placed in the baby's mouth, but there is
no nutrient delivered. In addition to providing a sense of safety, NNS even can
be regarded as an indicator of infant's central nervous system development. The
rich data, such as sucking frequency, the number of cycles, and their amplitude
during baby's non-nutritive sucking is important clue for judging the brain
development of infants or preterm infants. Nowadays most researchers are
collecting NNS data by using some contact devices such as pressure transducers.
However, such invasive contact will have a direct impact on the baby's natural
sucking behavior, resulting in significant distortion in the collected data.
Therefore, we propose a novel contact-less NNS data acquisition and
quantification scheme, which leverages the facial landmarks tracking technology
to extract the movement signals of baby's jaw from recorded baby's sucking
video. Since completion of the sucking action requires a large amount of
synchronous coordination and neural integration of the facial muscles and the
cranial nerves, the facial muscle movement signals accompanying baby's sucking
pacifier can indirectly replace the NNS signal. We have evaluated our method on
videos collected from several infants during their NNS behaviors and we have
achieved the quantified NNS patterns closely comparable to results from visual
inspection as well as contact-based sensor readings.

both the background plasma and the beam are relativistic J\""uttner
distributions. In the rest frame of the background, the only waves that can
satisfy the resonance condition are in a tiny range of slightly subluminal
phase speeds. The growth rate for the kinetic (or maser) version of the
weak-beam instability is much smaller than has been estimated for a
relativistically streaming Gaussian distribution, and the reasons for this are
discussed. The growth rate for the reactive version of the weak-beam
instability is treated in a conventional way. We compare the results with exact
calculations, and find that the approximate solutions are not consistent with
the exact results. We conclude that, for plausible parameters, there is no
reactive version of the instability. The growth rate in the pulsar frame is
smaller than that in the rest frame of the background plasma by a factor
$2\gamma_{\rm s}$, where $\gamma_{\rm s} = 10^2 {\rm -} 10^3$ is the Lorentz
factor of the bulk motion of the background plasma, placing a further
constraint on effective wave growth. Based on these results, we argue that
beam-driven wave growth probably plays no role in pulsar radio emission.

parallelly conducted tasks at the end of the architecture with one cost
function. Such architecture fails to take advantage of the combined power of
the features from each individual task at an early stage of the training. In
this research, we propose a new architecture, FTMTLNet, an MTL enabled by
feature transferring. Traditional transfer learning deals with the same or
similar task from different data sources (a.k.a. domain). The underlying
assumption is that the knowledge gained from source domains may help the
learning task on the target domain. Our proposed FTMTLNet utilizes the
different tasks from the same domain. Considering features from the tasks are

and automation, and their overhead has not been explored. In this work, we
propose TrustChain, as a three-layered trust management framework which uses a
consortium blockchain to track interactions among supply chain participants and
to dynamically assign trust and reputation scores based on these interactions.
The novelty of TrustChain stems from: (a) the reputation model that evaluates
the quality of commodities, and the trustworthiness of entities based on
multiple observations of supply chain events, (b) its support for reputation
scores that separate between a supply chain participant and products, enabling
the assignment of product-specific reputations for the same participant, (c)
the use of smart contracts for transparent, efficient, secure, and automated
calculation of reputation scores, and (d) its minimal overhead in terms of
latency and throughput when compared to a simple blockchain based supply chain
model.

software quality and security. While coarse-grained memory safety has improved,
achieving memory safety at the granularity of individual objects remains a
challenge due to high performance overheads which can be between ~1.7x-2.2x. In
this paper, we present a novel idea called Califorms, and associated program
observations, to obtain a low overhead security solution for practical,
byte-granular memory safety.
  The idea we build on is called memory blacklisting, which prohibits a program
from accessing certain memory regions based on program semantics. State of the
art hardware-supported memory blacklisting while much faster than software
blacklisting creates memory fragmentation (of the order of few bytes) for each
use of the blacklisted location. In this paper, we observe that metadata used
for blacklisting can be stored in dead spaces in a program's data memory and
that this metadata can be integrated into microarchitecture by changing the
cache line format. Using these observations, Califorms based system proposed in
this paper reduces the performance overheads of memory safety to ~1.02x-1.16x
while providing byte-granular protection and maintaining very low hardware
overheads.
  The low overhead offered by Califorms enables always on, memory safety for
small and large objects alike, and the fundamental idea of storing metadata in
empty spaces, and microarchitecture can be used for other security and
performance applications.

time, direction and magnitude of velocity impulses that minimize the total
impulse. This problem was posed in 1967 by T. N. Edelbaum, and while notable
advances have been made, a rigorous means to answer Edelbaum's question for
multiple-revolution maneuvers has remained elusive for over five decades. We
revisit Edelbaum's question by taking a bottom-up approach to generate a
minimum-fuel switching surface. Sweeping through time profiles of the
minimum-fuel switching function for increasing admissible thrust magnitude, and
in the high-thrust limit, we find that the continuous thrust switching surface
reveals the $N$-impulse solution. It is also shown that a \textit{fundamental}
minimum-thrust solution plays a pivotal role in our process to determine the
optimal minimum-fuel maneuver for all thrust levels. We find the answer to
Edelbaum's question is not generally unique, but is frequently a set of
equal-$\Delta v$ extremals. We further find, when Edelbaum's question is
refined to seek the number of finite duration thrust arcs for a specific rocket
engine, that a unique extremal is usually found. Numerical results demonstrate
the ideas and their utility for several interplanetary and Earth-bound optimal
transfers that consist of up to eleven impulses or, for finite thrust, short
thrust arcs. Another significant contribution of the paper can be viewed as a
unification in astrodynamics where the connection between impulsive and
continuous-thrust trajectories are demonstrated through the notion of
\textit{optimal switching surfaces}

infer a hypergraph replacement grammar from the ChEMBL database, count the

Simulating random molecules from the resulting probabilistic grammar, we show
that conditional priors result in a molecular distribution closer to the
training set than using equal rule probabilities or unconditional priors. We
then treat molecular optimization as a reinforcement learning problem, using a
novel modification of the policy gradient algorithm - batch-advantage: using
individual rewards minus the batch average reward to weight the log probability
loss. The reinforcement learning agent is tasked with building molecules using
this grammar, with the goal of maximizing benchmark scores available from the
literature. To do so, the agent has policies both to choose the next node in
the graph to expand and to select the next grammar rule to apply. The policies
are implemented using the Transformer architecture with the partially expanded
graph as the input at each step. We show that using the empirical priors as the
starting point for a policy eliminates the need for pre-training, and allows us
to reach optima faster. We achieve competitive performance on common benchmarks

The Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will carry out weak lensing
measurements in the near infrared using the new Teledyne H4RG-10 detector
arrays, which makes the range of possible detector systematics very different
from traditional weak lensing measurements using optical CCDs. One of the
non-linear detector effects observed in CCDs is the brighter-fatter effect
(BFE), in which charge already accumulated in a pixel alters the electric field
geometry and causes new charge to be deflected away from brighter pixels. Here
we describe the formalism for measuring the BFE using flat field correlation
functions in infrared detector arrays. The auto-correlation of CCD flat fields
is often used to measure the BFE, but because the infrared detector arrays are
read out with the charge ""in place,"" the flat field correlations are dominated
by capacitive cross-talk between neighboring pixels (the inter-pixel
capacitance, or IPC). Conversely, if the BFE is present and one does not
account for it, it can bias correlation measurements of the IPC and photon
transfer measurements of the gain. We show that because the infrared detector
arrays can be read out non-destructively, one can compute numerous
cross-correlation functions between different time slices of the same flat
exposures, and that correlations due to IPC and BFE leave distinct imprints. We
generate a suite of simulated flat fields and show that the underlying IPC and
BFE parameters can be extracted, even when both are present in the simulation.
There are some biases in the BFE coefficients up to 12%, which are likely
caused by higher order terms that are dropped from this analysis.

WFIRST will use infrared detector arrays, which must be fully characterized to
inform data reduction and calibration procedures such that unbiased
cosmological results can be achieved. Hirata & Choi 2019 introduces formalism
to connect the cross-correlation signal of different flat field time samples to
non-linear detector behaviors such as the brighter fatter effect (BFE) and
non-linear inter-pixel capacitance (NL-IPC), and this paper applies that
framework to a WFIRST development detector, SCA 18237. We find a residual
correlation signal after accounting for classical non-linearity. This residual
correlation contains a combination of the BFE and NL-IPC; however, further
tests suggest that the BFE is the dominant mechanism. If interpreted as a pure
BFE, it suggests that the effective area of a pixel is increased by
$(2.87\pm0.03)\times 10^{-7}$ (stat.) for every electron in the 4 nearest
neighbors, with a rapid $\sim r^{-5.6\pm0.2}$ fall-off of the effect for more
distant neighbors. We show that the IPC inferred from hot pixels contains the
same large-scale spatial variations as the IPC inferred from auto-correlations,
albeit with an overall offset of $\sim 0.06\%$. The NL-IPC inferred from hot
pixels is too small to explain the cross-correlation measurement, further
supporting the BFE hypothesis. This work presents the first evidence for the
BFE in an H4RG-10 detector, demonstrates some of the useful insights that can
be gleaned from flat field statistics, and represents a significant step
towards calibration of WFIRST data.

intersection is a union of two marginal independences. We consider two
sequences of such models, one from each type of independence, that are closest
to each other in the Kullback-Leibler sense as they approach the intersection.
They become indistinguishable if the signal strength, as measured by the
product of two correlation parameters, decreases faster than the standard
parametric rate. Under local alternatives at such rate, we show that the
asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio depends on where and how the
local alternatives approach the intersection. To deal with this non-uniformity,
we study a class of ""envelope"" distributions by taking pointwise suprema over
asymptotic cumulative distribution functions. We show that these envelope
distributions are well-behaved and lead to model selection procedures with
rate-free uniform error guarantees and near-optimal power. To control the error

accuracy. Because covariance features consist of second-order statistics, the
scale of the feature elements are varied. Therefore, normalizing covariance
features using a matrix square root affects the performance improvement. When
pooling methods are applied to local features extracted from CNN models, the
accuracy increases when the pooling function is back-propagatable and the
feature-extraction model is learned in an end-to-end manner. Recently, the
iterative polynomial approximation method for the matrix square root of a
covariance feature was proposed, and resulted in a faster and more stable
training than the methods based on singular-value decomposition. In this paper,
we propose an extension of compact bilinear pooling, which is a compact
approximation of the standard covariance feature, to the polynomials of the
covariance feature. Subsequently, we apply the proposed approximation to the
polynomial corresponding to the matrix square root to obtain a compact
approximation for the square root of the covariance feature. Our method
approximates a higher-dimensional polynomial of a covariance by the weighted
sum of the approximate features corresponding to a pair of local features based
on the similarity of the local features. We apply our method for standard
fine-grained image recognition datasets and demonstrate that the proposed
method shows comparable accuracy with fewer dimensions than the original
feature.

dependent variable and explanatory covariates. Oftentimes, the linear
relationships vary across space, when some covariates have location-specific
effects on the response. One fundamental question is how to detect the
systematic variation in the model and identify which locations share common
regression coefficients and which do not. Only a correct model structure can
assure unbiased estimation of coefficients and valid inferences. In this work,
we propose a new procedure, called Spatial Heterogeneity Automatic Detection
and Estimation (SHADE), for automatically and simultaneously subgrouping and
estimating covariate effects for spatial regression models. The SHADE employs a
class of spatially-weighted fusion type penalty on all pairs of observations,
with location-specific weight adaptively constructed using spatial information,
to cluster coefficients into subgroups. Under certain regularity conditions,
the SHADE is shown to be able to identify the true model structure with
probability approaching one and estimate regression coefficients consistently.
We develop an alternating direction method of multiplier algorithm (ADMM) to
compute the SHAD efficiently. In numerical studies, we demonstrate empirical
performance of the SHADE by using different choices of weights and compare
their accuracy. The results suggest that spatial information can enhance
subgroup structure analysis in challenging situations when the spatial
variation among regression coefficients is small or the number of repeated
measures is small. Finally, the SHADE is applied to find the relationship
between a natural resource survey and a land cover data layer to identify
spatially interpretable groups.

prepare the atomic entangled states before they enter into the cavity. We show
that the initial atomic coherence will induce an effective driving to the
cavity field, whose steady state is an incoherent superposition of orthogonal
states, with the superposition probabilities being dependent on the atom-cavity
coupling strength. By measuring the average photon number of the cavity in the
steady state, we demonstrate that the root-mean-square of the fluctuation of
the atom-cavity coupling strength is proportional to $1/N_c^2$ ($N_c$ is the
effective atom number interacting with the photon in the cavity during its

computer science disciplines. There are several variants of the similarity
search problem, and one of the most relevant is the $r$-near neighbor ($r$-NN)
problem: given a radius $r>0$ and a set of points $S$, construct a data
structure that, for any given query point $q$, returns a point $p$ within
distance at most $r$ from $q$. In this paper, we study the $r$-NN problem in
the light of fairness. We consider fairness in the sense of equal opportunity:
all points that are within distance $r$ from the query should have the same
probability to be returned. In the low-dimensional case, this problem was first
studied by Hu, Qiao, and Tao (PODS 2014). Locality sensitive hashing (LSH), the
theoretically strongest approach to similarity search in high dimensions, does
not provide such a fairness guarantee. To address this, we propose efficient
data structures for $r$-NN where all points in $S$ that are near $q$ have the
same probability to be selected and returned by the query. Specifically, we
first propose a black-box approach that, given any LSH scheme, constructs a
data structure for uniformly sampling points in the neighborhood of a query.
Then, we develop a data structure for fair similarity search under inner
product that requires nearly-linear space and exploits locality sensitive
filters. The paper concludes with an experimental evaluation that highlights
(un)fairness in a recommendation setting on real-world datasets and discusses
the inherent unfairness introduced by solving other variants of the problem.

nonlinearity balances the dispersion in the system, thus providing the

accommodating the flavour anomalies while also explaining the relative
smallness of neutrino mass without the need for cancellation between leptoquark
contributions. A characteristic prediction of our model is a rate of
muon--electron conversion in nuclei fixed by the anomalies in $b \to s \mu \mu$
and neutrino mass; the COMET experiment will thus test and potentially falsify
our scenario. The model also predicts signatures that will be tested at the LHC
and Belle II.

Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, flare kernels were observed to move along flare
ribbons at velocities $v_\parallel$ of up to $450$ km\,s$^{-1}$. Kernel
velocities were found to be roughly anti-correlated with strength of the
magnetic field. Apparent slipping motion of flare loops was observed in the
131\,\AA{} only for the slowest kernels moving through strong-$B$ region. In
order to interpret the observed relation between $B_{\text{LOS}}$ and
$v_\parallel$, we examined distribution of the norm $N$, a quantity closely
related to the slippage velocity. We then calculated the norm $N$ of the
quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) in MHD model of a solar eruption adapted to the
magnetic environment which qualitatively agrees to that of the observed event.
We found that both the modelled $N$ and velocities of kernels reach their
highest values in the same weak-field regions, one located in the curved part
of the ribbon hook and the other in the straight part of the conjugate ribbon
located close to a parasitic polarity. Oppositely, lower values of the kernel
velocities are seen at the tip of the ribbon hook, where the modelled $N$ is
low. Since the modelled distribution of $N$ matches the observed dynamics of
kernels, this supports that the kernel motions can be interpreted as a
signature of QSL reconnection during the eruption.

carried by energetic electrons that transfer and deposit energy in the Sun's
atmosphere. Electron transport is often approximated by a cold thick-target
model (CTTM), assuming that electron energy is much larger than the temperature
of the ambient plasma, and electron energy evolution is modeled as a systematic
loss. Using kinetic modeling of electrons, we re-evaluate the transport and
deposition of flare energy. Using a full collisional warm-target model (WTM),
we account for electron thermalization and for the properties of the ambient
coronal plasma such as its number density, temperature and spatial extent. We
show that the deposition of non-thermal electron energy in the lower atmosphere
is highly dependent on the properties of the flaring coronal plasma. In
general, thermalization and a reduced WTM energy loss rate leads to an increase
of non-thermal energy transferred to the chromosphere, and the deposition of
non-thermal energy at greater depths. The simulations show that energy is
deposited in the lower atmosphere initially by high energy non-thermal
electrons, and later by lower energy non-thermal electrons that partially or
fully thermalize in the corona, over timescales of seconds, unaccounted for in
previous studies. This delayed heating may act as a diagnostic of both the
injected non-thermal electron distribution and the coronal plasma, vital for

considerable challenge to resolve the pinch points in simulation or experiment
as they represent a very long range correlation. Here we present very high
resolution simulations of the polarized neutron scattering structure factor of
dipolar spin ice and new analytical theory of the pinch point profiles. We
compare these with existing theory and experiment. We find that our simulations
are consistent with theories that reveal the pinch points to be infinitely
sharp, as a result of unscreened dipolar fields. However, neither simulation
nor these theories are consistent with experiments, which instead is
quantitatively captured by a theory that allows for screening of the dipolar
fields and consequent strong broadening of the pinch points. This striking
paradox is not easily resolved: broadening of the pinch points by random
disorder seems to have been ruled out by existing theory, while deficiencies in
the Hamiltonian description are not relevant. Intriguingly, we are left to
consider the role of quantum fluctuations or the possibility of a fundamental
correction to either the standard method of simulating dipolar systems, or the

the action of $Q$ on the dual abelian group $\hat V$ has a free orbit of full
measure. We show that such a group $G$ can be quantized in three equivalent
ways: (1) by reflecting across the Galois object defined by the canonical
irreducible representation of $G$ on $L^2(V)$; (2) by twisting the coproduct on
the group von Neumann algebra of $G$ by a dual $2$-cocycle obtained from the
$G$-equivariant Kohn-Nirenberg quantization of $V\times\hat V$; (3) by
considering the bicrossed product defined by a matched pair of subgroups of
$Q\ltimes\hat V$ both isomorphic to $Q$. In the simplest case of the $ax+b$
group over the reals, the dual cocycle in (2) is an analytic analogue of the
Jordanian twist. It was first found by Stachura using different ideas. The
equivalence of approaches (2) and (3) in this case implies that the quantum
$ax+b$ group of Baaj-Skandalis is isomorphic to the quantum group defined by
Stachura. Along the way we prove a number of results for arbitrary locally
compact groups $G$. Using recent results of De Commer we show that a class of
$G$-Galois objects is parametrized by certain cohomology classes in
$H^2(G;\mathbb T)$. This extends results of Wassermann and Davydov in the
finite group case. A new phenomenon is that already the unit class in
$H^2(G;\mathbb T)$ can correspond to a nontrivial Galois object. Specifically,
we show that any nontrivial locally compact group $G$ with group von Neumann
algebra a factor of type I admits a canonical cohomology class of dual
$2$-cocycles such that the corresponding quantization of $G$ is neither
commutative nor cocommutative.

of 58 post-starburst galaxies (PSBs). There is an anticorrelation between
specific dust mass ($M_{\rm dust}$/$M_{\star}$) and the time elapsed since the
starburst ended, indicating that dust was either destroyed, expelled, or
rendered undetectable over the $\sim$1 Gyr after the burst. The $M_{\rm
dust}$/$M_{\star}$ depletion timescale, 205$^{+58}_{-37}$ Myr, is consistent
with that of the CO-traced $M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\star}$, suggesting that dust and
gas are altered via the same process. Extrapolating these trends leads to the
$M_{\rm dust}/M_{\star}$ and $M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\star}$ values of early-type
galaxies (ETGs) within 1-2 Gyr, a timescale consistent with the evolution of
other PSB properties into ETGs. Comparing $M_{\rm dust}$ and $M_{\rm H_2}$ for
PSBs yields a calibration, log $M_{\rm H_2}$ = 0.45 log $M_{\rm dust}$ + 6.02,
that allows us to place 33 PSBs on the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) plane, $\Sigma
\rm SFR-\Sigma M_{\rm H_2}$. Over the first $\sim$200-300 Myr, the PSBs evolve
down and off of the KS relation, as their star formation rate (SFR) decreases
more rapidly than $M_{\rm H_2}$. Afterwards, $M_{\rm H_2}$ continues to decline
whereas the SFR levels off. These trends suggest that the star-formation
efficiency bottoms out at 10$^{-11}\ \rm yr^{-1}$ and will rise to ETG levels
within 0.5-1.1 Gyr afterwards. The SFR decline after the burst is likely due to
the absence of gas denser than the CO-traced H$_2$. The mechanism of the
$M_{\rm dust}/M_{\star}$ and$M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\star}$ decline, whose timescale
suggests active galactic nucleus (AGN) or low-ionization nuclear emission-line
region (LINER) feedback, may also be preventing the large CO-traced molecular
gas reservoirs from collapsing and forming denser star forming clouds.

medical image analysis. Solving this problem can be challenging if, during
optimization, the automated method cannot access information about the location
of the lesions nor is given single examples of the lesions. We propose a new
weakly supervised detection method using neural networks, that computes
attention maps revealing the locations of brain lesions. These attention maps
are computed using the last feature maps of a segmentation network optimized
only with global image-level labels. The proposed method can generate attention
maps at full input resolution without need for interpolation during
preprocessing, which allows small lesions to appear in attention maps. For
comparison, we modify state-of-the-art methods to compute attention maps for
weakly supervised object detection, by using a global regression objective
instead of the more conventional classification objective. This regression
objective optimizes the number of occurrences of the target object in an image,
e.g. the number of brain lesions in a scan, or the number of digits in an
image. We study the behavior of the proposed method in MNIST-based detection
datasets, and evaluate it for the challenging detection of enlarged
perivascular spaces - a type of brain lesion - in a dataset of 2202 3D scans
with point-wise annotations in the center of all lesions in four brain regions.
In the brain dataset, the weakly supervised detection methods come close to the
human intrarater agreement in each region. The proposed method reaches the best
area under the curve in two out of four regions, and has the lowest number of
false positive detections in all regions, while its average sensitivity over
all regions is similar to that of the other best methods. The proposed method
can facilitate epidemiological and clinical studies of enlarged perivascular
spaces.

decoupled core (KDC) with a size of 2"" (160 pc), exhibiting an inverted pattern
for velocity with respect to the main body of its host galaxy. The rotation
curve of the stellar component in the inner region of EVCC 591 is steeper than
that in the rest of the galaxy. On the other hand, overall velocity profiles of
stellar and ionized gas components of EVCC 516 show no signature of significant
rotation. The occurrence of a KDC and zero rotation in the internal kinematics
along with the central star formation support the scenario of gas-rich
dwarf-dwarf mergers in the formation of these two dE(bc)s. Furthermore,
evolution of dE(bc)s in a cluster environment into ordinary dEs with KDCs is
possible based on their structural properties. We suggest that at least some of

example of how two tools that have recently become accessible to a wide range
of researchers, crowd-sourcing and deep learning, can be combined to explore
satellite imagery at scale. In particular, the focus is on the organization of
shallow cumulus convection in the trade wind regions. Shallow clouds play a
large role in the Earth's radiation balance yet are poorly represented in
climate models. For this project four subjective patterns of organization were
defined: Sugar, Flower, Fish and Gravel. On cloud labeling days at two
institutes, 67 scientists screened 10,000 satellite images on a crowd-sourcing
platform and classified almost 50,000 mesoscale cloud clusters. This dataset is
then used as a training dataset for deep learning algorithms that make it
possible to automate the pattern detection and create global climatologies of
the four patterns. Analysis of the geographical distribution and large-scale
environmental conditions indicates that the four patterns have some overlap
with established modes of organization, such as open and closed cellular
convection, but also differ in important ways. The results and dataset from
this project suggests promising research questions. Further, this study
illustrates that crowd-sourcing and deep learning complement each other well

assess the quality of document images uploaded in online business process, so
as to reject those images of low quality. In this paper, we attempt to achieve
document image quality assessment and our contributions are twofold. Firstly,
since document image quality assessment is more interested in text, we propose
a text line based framework to estimate document image quality, which is
composed of three stages: text line detection, text line quality prediction,
and overall quality assessment. Text line detection aims to find potential text
lines with a detector. In the text line quality prediction stage, the quality
score is computed for each text line with a CNN-based prediction model. The
overall quality of document images is finally assessed with the ensemble of all
text line quality. Secondly, to train the prediction model, a large-scale
dataset, comprising 52,094 text line images, is synthesized with diverse
attributes. For each text line image, a quality label is computed with a
piece-wise function. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, comprehensive experiments are evaluated on two popular document
image quality assessment benchmarks. Our framework significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods by large margins on the large and complicated

of the target duration and jeopardize prediction, we propose to consider a
plug-in estimate of the true risk based on a Kaplan-Meier estimator of the
conditional survival function of the censorship $C$ given $X$, referred to as
Kaplan-Meier risk, in order to perform empirical risk minimization. It is
established, under mild conditions, that the learning rate of minimizers of
this biased/weighted empirical risk functional is of order
$O_{\mathbb{P}}(\sqrt{\log(n)/n})$ when ignoring model bias issues inherent to
plug-in estimation, as can be attained in absence of censorship. Beyond
theoretical results, numerical experiments are presented in order to illustrate
the relevance of the approach developed.

underground with a distance of 53$\,$km to two nuclear power plants. As a
result, it is exposed to a muon flux that requires a precise muon
reconstruction to make a veto of cosmogenic backgrounds viable. Established
muon tracking algorithms use time residuals to a track hypothesis. We developed
an alternative muon tracking algorithm that utilizes the geometrical shape of
the fastest light. It models the full shape of the first, direct light produced
along the muon track. From the intersection with the spherical PMT array, the
track parameters are extracted with a likelihood fit. The algorithm finds a
selection of PMTs based on their first hit times and charges. Subsequently, it
fits on timing information only. On a sample of through-going muons with a full
simulation of readout electronics, we report a spatial resolution of 20$\,$cm
of distance from the detector's center and an angular resolution of
1.6$\,^{\circ}$ over the whole detector. Additionally, a dead time estimation
is performed to measure the impact of the muon veto. Including the step of
waveform reconstruction on top of the track reconstruction, a loss in exposure
of only 4% can be achieved compared to the case of a perfect tracking
algorithm. When including only the PMT time resolution, but no further

an isolated disc galaxy. We newly implement the evolution of full grain size
distribution by sampling 32 grid points on the axis of the grain radius. We
solve it consistently with the chemical enrichment and hydrodynamic evolution
of the galaxy. This enables us to theoretically investigate spatially resolved
evolution of grain size distribution in a galaxy. The grain size distribution
evolves from a large-grain-dominated ($\gtrsim 0.1~\mu$m) phase to a
small-grain production phase, eventually converging to a power-law-like grain
size distribution similar to the so-called MRN distribution. We find that the
small-grain abundance is higher in the dense ISM in the early epoch ($t\lesssim
1$ Gyr) because of efficient dust growth by accretion, while coagulation makes
the small-grain abundance less enhanced in the dense ISM later. This leads to
steeper extinction curves in the dense ISM than in the diffuse ISM in the early
phase, while they show the opposite trend later. The radial trend is also
described by faster evolution in the inner part. We also confirm that the
simulation reproduces the observed trend in the relation between dust-to-gas
ratio and metallicity, and in the radial gradients of dust-to-gas ratio and
dust-to-metal ratio. Since the above change in the grain size distribution
occurs at $t\sim 1$ Gyr, the age and density dependence of grain size
distribution has a significant impact on the extinction curves even at high
redshift.

infinite-size algorithm by Evertz and von der Linden. Fitting the MC data with
the asymptotic form above the critical temperature, we reproduce the exact

physical and biological properties and redistribute energy budgets in the
ocean. Eddy kinetic energy is commonly defined as the kinetic energy of the
time-varying component of the velocity field. However, this definition contains
all processes that vary in time, including coherent mesoscale eddies, jets,
waves, and large-scale motions. The focus of this paper is on the eddy kinetic
energy contained in coherent mesoscale eddies. We present a new method to
decompose eddy kinetic energy into oceanic processes. The proposed method uses
a new eddy-identification algorithm (TrackEddy). This algorithm is based on the
premise that the sea level signature of a coherent eddy can be approximated as
a Gaussian feature. The eddy Gaussian signature then allows for the calculation
of kinetic energy of the eddy field through the geostrophic approximation.
TrackEddy has been validated using synthetic sea surface height data, and then
used to investigate trends of eddy kinetic energy in the Southern Ocean using
Satellite Sea Surface Height anomaly (AVISO+). We detect an increasing trend of
eddy kinetic energy associated with mesoscale eddies in the Southern Ocean.
This trend is correlated with an increase of the coherent eddy amplitude and
the strengthening of wind stress over the last two decades.

Cauchy information of their solutions. Most papers in the field study this
nonlinear and severely ill-posed problem using optimal control. The main
drawback of this widely used approach is the need of some advanced knowledge of
the true solution. In this paper, we propose a new method that opens a door to
solve nonlinear inverse problems for parabolic equations without any initial
guess of the true coefficient. This claim is confirmed numerically. The key
point of the method is to derive a system of nonlinear elliptic equations for
the Fourier coefficients of the solution to the governing equation with respect
to a special basis of L^2. We then solve this system by a predictor-corrector
process, in which our computation to obtain the first and second predictors is
effective. The desired solution to the inverse problem under consideration
follows.

plasmonic nano-optical tweezers face the issue of local temperature increase.
Here, we develop three independent methods based on molecular fluorescence to
quantify the temperature increase induced by a 1064 nm trapping beam focused on
single and double nanoholes milled in gold films. We show that the temperature
in the nanohole can be increased by 10{\deg}C even at the moderate intensities

found to be largely governed by the Ohmic losses into the metal layer,

non-conservative evolution was also proposed.
  Aims. Our purpose is to study the long term averaged mass-accretion rates in
all the Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars discovered so far, to investigate a
non-conservative mass-transfer scenario.
  Methods. We calculated the expected mass-transfer rate under the hypothesis
of a conservative evolution based on their orbital periods and on the (minimum)
mass of the secondary (as derived from the mass function), driven by
gravitational radiation and/or magnetic braking. Using this theoretical
mass-transfer, we determined the expected accretion luminosity of the systems.
Thus, we achieved the lower limit to the distance of the sources by comparing
the computed theoretical luminosity and the observed flux averaged over a time
period of 20 years. Then, the lower limit to the distance of the sources has
been compared to the value of the distance reported in literature to evaluate
how reasonable is the hypothesis of a conservative mass-transfer.
  Results. Based on a sample of 18 sources, we found strong evidences of a
non-conservative mass-transfer for five sources, for which the estimated
distance lower limits are higher than their known distances. We also report
hints for mass outflows in other six sources. The discrepancy can be fixed
under the hypothesis of a non-conservative mass-transfer in which a fraction of
the mass transferred onto the compact object is swept away from the system,
likely due to the (rotating magnetic dipole) radiation pressure of the pulsar.

sources of different scopes and knowledge domains. Causes for this challenge
are context-specific requirements (i.e. no ""one model fits all""), different

Moreover, even if the problem of semantic heterogeneity among different RDF
publishers and knowledge domains is solved, querying and accessing the data of
distributed RDF datasets on the Web is not straightforward. This is because of
the complex and fastidious process needed to understand how these datasets can
be related or linked, and consequently, queried. To address this issue, we
propose to extend the existing Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID) by
introducing new terms such as the Virtual Link Set concept and data model
patterns. A virtual link is a connection between resources such as literals and
IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifier) with some commonality where each
of these resources is from a different RDF dataset. The links are required in
order to understand how to semantically relate datasets. In addition, we
describe several benefits of using virtual links to improve interoperability

profusion may be a result of a higher abundance of $\alpha$ elements associated
with iron-poor, high-velocity stars. Furthermore, we have identified an
increase in small planet occurrence with iron abundance, particularly for the
slower stars ($V_\mathrm{tot} < 30\ \mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$), where the occurrence
increased to $f \sim 1.1$ planets per star in the iron-rich domain. Our results
suggest there are two regions in the

$S$-wave hadron-hadron scatterings by the HAL QCD method in lattice QCD. We
consider the Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter (NBS) wave function for the spin-singlet
$\Lambda_c N$ system calculated in the $(2+1)$-flavor QCD on a
$(32a~\mathrm{fm})^3$ lattice at the lattice spacing $a\simeq0.0907$ fm and

extracted by Misner's method from the NBS wave function projected to $A_1^+$
representation of the cubic group, which contains small $l\ge 4$ components.
Furthermore, while the higher partial wave components are enhanced so as to
produce significant comb-like structures in the conventional HAL QCD potential
if the Laplacian approximated by the usual second order difference is applied
to the NBS wave function, such structures are found to be absent in the
potential extracted by Misner's method, where the Laplacian can be evaluated
analytically for each partial wave component. Despite the difference in the
potentials, two methods give almost identical results on the central values and
on the magnitude of statistical errors for the fits of the potentials, and
consequently on the scattering phase shifts. This indicates not only that
Misner's method works well in lattice QCD with the HAL QCD method but also that
the contaminations from higher partial waves in the study of $S$-wave
scatterings are well under control even in the conventional HAL QCD method. It
will be of interest to study interactions in higher partial wave channels in

oscillations. These transverse oscillations are not connected to any external
phenomena like flares or coronal mass ejections, and show significantly lower
amplitudes than the externally excited decaying oscillations. Numerical studies
have managed to reproduce such decayless oscillations in the form of footpoint
driven standing waves in coronal loops, and to treat them as a possible
mechanism for wave heating of the solar corona. Our aim is to investigate the
correlation between the observed amplitudes of the oscillations and input the
energy flux from different drivers. We perform 3D MHD simulations in single,
straight, density-enhanced coronal flux tubes for different drivers, in the
presence of gravity. Synthetic images at different spectral lines are
constructed with the use of the FoMo code. The development of the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability leads to mixing of plasma between the flux tube
and the hot corona. Once the KHI is fully developed, the amplitudes of the
decayless oscillations show only a weak correlation with the driver strength.
We find that low amplitude decayless kink oscillations may correspond to
significant energy fluxes of the order of the radiative losses for the Quiet
Sun. A clear correlation between the input energy flux and the observed
amplitudes from our synthetic imaging data cannot be established. Stronger
drivers lead to higher vales of the line width estimated energy fluxes.
Finally, estimations of the energy fluxes by spectroscopic data are affected by
the LOS angle, favoring combined analysis of imaging and spectroscopic data for
single oscillating loops.

numerically available via an explicit formulation of the associated

network architecture that mimics a high-dimensional model representation. The
database for training this network is assembled through solving a set of
microscopic boundary values problems with the prescribed macroscopic
deformation gradients (input data) and subsequently retrieving the
corresponding averaged energies (output data). Therefore, the two-scale
computational procedure for the nonlinear elasticity can be broken down into
two solvers for microscopic and macroscopic equilibrium equations that work
separately in two stages, called the offline and online stages. A standard
finite element method is employed to solve the equilibrium equation at the
macroscale. As for mircoscopic problems, an FFT-based collocation method is
applied in tandem with the Newton-Raphson iteration and the conjugate-gradient
method. Particularly, we solve the microscopic equilibrium equation in the
Lippmann-Schwinger form without resorting to the reference medium and thus
avoid the fixed-point iteration that might require quite strict numerical

joint fits with X-ray data are important in order to assess the photospheric
scenario. Here we consider a particular photospheric model which assumes
localized subphotospheric dissipation by internal shocks in a non-magnetized
outflow. We investigate it using Bayesian inference and a sample of 8 GRBs with
known redshifts which are observed simultaneously with $\textit{Fermi}$ GBM and
$\textit{Swift}$ XRT. This provides us with an energy range of $0.3$~keV to
$40$~MeV and much tighter parameter constraints. We analyze 32 spectra and find
that 16 are well described by the model. We also find that the estimates of the
bulk Lorentz factor, $\Gamma$, and the fireball luminosity, $L_{0,52}$,
decrease while the fraction of dissipated energy, $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{d}}$,
increase in the joint fits compared to GBM only fits. These changes are caused
by a small excess of counts in the XRT data, relative to the model predictions
from fits to GBM only data. The fact that our limited implementation of the
physical scenario yields 50\% accepted spectra is promising, and we discuss
possible model revisions in the light of the new data. Specifically, we argue
that the inclusion of significant magnetization, as well as removing the
assumption of internal shocks, will provide better fits at low energies.

with the multi-frequency sparse backscattering data. Some approximate
uniqueness results have also been showed based on the weak scattering
approximation and the Kirchhoff approximation. The theoretical basis of the
direct sampling method is initially established based on these two
approximations. Numerical examples in two dimensions are presented to validity
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed direct sampling method. In

the properties of neutron stars (NSs). We construct 97 new finite-temperature
equations of state (EOSs) of dense matter that obey current experimental,
observational, and theoretical constraints and discuss how systematic
variations in the EOS parameters affect the properties of cold nonrotating NSs
and the core collapse of a $20\,M_\odot$ progenitor star. The core collapse of
the $20\,M_\odot$ progenitor star is simulated in spherical symmetry using the
general-relativistic radiation-hydrodynamics code GR1D where neutrino
interactions are computed for each EOS using the NuLib library. We conclude
that the effective mass of nucleons at densities above nuclear saturation
density is the largest source of uncertainty in the CCSN neutrino signal and
dynamics even though it plays a subdominant role in most properties of cold NS
matter. Meanwhile, changes in other observables affect the properties of cold
NSs, while having little effect in CCSNe. To strengthen our conclusions, we
perform six octant three-dimensional CCSN simulations varying the effective
mass of nucleons at nuclear saturation density. We conclude that neutrino
heating and, thus, the likelihood of explosion is significantly increased for
EOSs where the effective mass of nucleons at nuclear saturation density is
large.

performing Bayesian statistical inference on challenging state space models

iteration of an MCMC algorithm to unbiasedly estimate the likelihood for a
given static parameter value. However, pMCMC can be computationally intensive
when a large number of particles in the PF is required, such as when the data
is highly informative, the model is misspecified and/or the time series is

the data assimilation literature to speed up pMCMC. We replace the unbiased PF
likelihood with the biased EnKF likelihood estimate within MCMC to sample over
the space of the static parameter. On a wide class of different non-linear SSM

significantly reduce the computational cost whilst maintaining reasonable

MYSO, gaseous clumps and low-mass stellar companions can form, which will
influence the future evolution of massive protostars in the Hertzsprung-Russell

synthetic images of disc structures modelled by the

Both spiral arms and gaseous clumps located at ~a few 100 au from the protostar

that substructures are observable regardless of their viewing geometry or can
be inferred in the case of an edge-viewed disc. The observation probability of
the clumps increases with the gradually increasing efficiency of gravitational
instability at work as the disc evolves. As a consequence, large discs around
MYSOs close to the zero-age-main-sequence line exhibit more substructures than
at the end of the gravitational collapse. Our results motivate further

$\Gamma$-convergence, of a sequence of variational models of brittle damage in
the context of linearized elasticity. The study is performed as the damaged
zone concentrates into a set of zero volume and, at the same time and to the
same order $\varepsilon$, the stiffness of the damaged material becomes small.
Three main features make the analysis highly nontrivial: at $\varepsilon$
fixed, minimizing sequences of each brittle damage model oscillate and develop
microstructures; as $\varepsilon\to 0$, concentration and saturation of damage
are favoured; and the competition of these phenomena translates into a
degeneration of the growth of the elastic energy, which passes from being
quadratic (at $\varepsilon$ fixed) to being of linear-growth type (in the
limit). Consequently, homogenization effects interact with singularity
formation in a nontrivial way, which requires new methods of analysis. In
particular, the interaction of homogenization with singularity formation in the
framework of linearized elasticity appears to not have been considered in the
literature so far. We explicitly identify the $\Gamma$-limit in two and three
dimensions for isotropic Hooke tensors. The expression of the limit effective
energy turns out to be of Hencky plasticity type. We further consider the
regime where the divergence remains square-integrable in the limit, which leads
to a Tresca-type model.

\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}$ we denote by $W(\psi)$ the set of all $x\in\mathbb{R}$
such that $|nx-a|<\psi(n)$ for infinitely many $a,n$. Analogously, denote
$W'(\psi)$ if we additionally require $a,n$ to be coprime. Aistleitner et al.
[1] proved that $W'(\psi)$ is of full Lebesgue measure if there exist an
$\varepsilon>0$ such that $\sum_{n=2}^\infty\psi(n)\varphi(n)/(n(\log
n)^\varepsilon)=\infty$. This result seems to be the best one can expect from
the method used. Assuming the extra divergence $\sum_{n=2}^\infty\psi(n)/(\log
n)^\varepsilon=\infty$ we prove that $W(\psi)$ is of full measure. This could
also be deduced from the result in [1], but we believe that our proof is of
independent interest, since its method is totally different from the one in
[1]. As a further application of our method, we prove that a variant of
Khintchine's theorem is true without monotonicity, subject to an additional
condition on the set of divisors of the support of $\psi$.

the measurement error of the instrumental variable does not bias the estimate,
the measurement error of the treatment biases the estimate away from zero, and

been widely used in 3D biomedical segmentation and achieved state-of-the-art

quantification. Two approaches are widely used in the literature to fuse
multiple modalities in the segmentation networks: early-fusion (which stacks
multiple modalities as different input channels) and late-fusion (which fuses
the segmentation results from different modalities at the very end). These
fusion methods easily suffer from the cross-modal interference caused by the
input modalities which have wide variations. To address the problem, we propose
a novel deep learning architecture, namely OctopusNet, to better leverage and
fuse the information contained in multi-modalities. The proposed framework
employs a separate encoder for each modality for feature extraction and
exploits a hyper-fusion decoder to fuse the extracted features while avoiding
feature explosion. We evaluate the proposed OctopusNet on two publicly

show that our framework outperforms the commonly-used feature fusion approaches

Various feature-based local explanations generation methods have been designed
to give us more insights on the decision of complex classifiers. Nevertheless,
there is no consensus on evaluating the quality of different explanations. In
response to this lack of comprehensive evaluation, we introduce the c-Eval
metric and its corresponding framework to quantify the feature-based local
explanation's quality. Given a classifier's prediction and the corresponding
explanation on that prediction, c-Eval is the minimum-distortion perturbation
that successfully alters the prediction while keeping the explanation's
features unchanged. We then demonstrate how c-Eval can be computed using some
modifications on existing adversarial generation libraries. To show that c-Eval
captures the importance of input's features, we establish the connection
between c-Eval and the features returned by explainers in affine and
nearly-affine classifiers. We then introduce the c-Eval plot, which not only
displays a strong connection between c-Eval and explainers' quality, but also
helps automatically determine explainer's parameters. Since the generation of
c-Eval relies on adversarial generation, we provide a demo of c-Eval on
adversarial-robust models and show that the metric is applicable in those
models. Finally, extensive experiments of explainers on different datasets are
conducted to support the adoption of c-Eval in evaluating explainers'
performance.

approach, an optical phase shift is introduced by the physical elongation and
by the stress induced in the vibrating cantilever. Most interesting, such a
device can store optical information in the form of a phase shift, related to
the frequency path-dependence of the vibration. This remarkable property stems
from the intrinsic non-linear dynamical behavior of the device, resembling
Duffing-like oscillators. In this proof-of-concept, the micro-device is
manufactured in a single fused silica chip using femtosecond laser exposure
combined with chemical etching and CO2-laser polishing to achieve optical

classes of chemically peculiar stars, are thought to be products of the
interaction of low- and intermediate-mass binaries which occurred when the most
evolved star was in the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Binary evolution
models predict that if the initial orbital periods of such systems are shorter
than a few thousand days, their orbits should have circularised due to tidal
effects. However, observations of the progeny of AGB binaries show that many of
these objects have substantial eccentricities, up to about 0.9. In this work we
explore the impact of wind mass transfer on the orbits of AGB binaries by
performing numerical simulations in which the AGB wind is modelled using a
hydrodynamical code and the stellar dynamics is evolved using an N-body code.
We find that in most models wind mass transfer contributes to the
circularisation of the orbit, but on longer timescales than tidal
circularisation if the eccentricity is less than about 0.4. For low initial
wind velocities and pseudo-synchronisation of the donor star, we find a
structure resembling wind Roche-lobe overflow near periastron. In this case,
the interaction between the gas and the stars is stronger than for high initial
wind velocities and the orbit shrinks while the eccentricity decreases. In one
of our models wind interaction is found to pump the eccentricity on a similar
timescale as tidal circularisation. Although our study is based on a small
sample of models, it offers some insight into the orbital evolution of
eccentric binaries interacting via winds. A larger grid of numerical models for
different binary parameters is needed to test if a regime exists where
hydrodynamical eccentricity pumping can effectively counteract tidal
circularisation, and if this can explain the puzzling eccentricities of the
descendants of AGB binaries.

concentration-dependent diffusion of species coupled with a frontal
neutralization reaction can produce a multi-layer system where low density
depleted zones could be embedded between the denser layers. This leads to the
excitation of chemoconvective modes spatially separated from each other by a
motionless fluid. In this paper, we show that the layers can interact via a
diffusion mechanism. Since diffusively-coupled instabilities initially have
different wavelengths, this causes a long-wave modulation of one pattern by
another. We have developed a mathematical model which includes a system of
reaction-diffusion-convection equations. The linear stability of a transient
base state is studied by calculating the growth rate of the Lyapunov exponent

disordered fingering structure. We show that in this system, the coordinate
co-directed to the reaction front paradoxically plays the role of time, time
itself acts as a bifurcation parameter, and a complete spatial analog of the
Ruelle-Takens-Newhouse scenario of the chaos onset is observed.

substellar companions (planets, brown dwarfs) from the observed relative

velocity gives direct constraints on the orbit and on the dynamical masses of
companions. A brown dwarf was discovered with the VLT/SPHERE instrument in
2017, which orbits at $\sim$ 11 au around HD 206893. Its mass was estimated
between 12 and 50 $M_{Jup}$ from evolutionary models and its photometry.
However, given the significant uncertainty on the age of the system and the
peculiar spectrophotometric properties of the companion, this mass is not well
constrained. We aim at constraining the orbit and dynamical mass of HD 206893
B. We combined radial velocity data obtained with HARPS spectra and astrometric
data obtained with the high contrast imaging VLT/SPHERE and VLT/NaCo
instruments, with a time baseline less than three years. We then combined those
data with astrometry data obtained by Hipparcos and Gaia with a time baseline
of 24 years. We used a MCMC approach to estimate the orbital parameters and
dynamical mass of the brown dwarf from those data. We infer a period between 21

206893 B relative astrometry. The RV data show a significant RV drift over 1.6
yrs. We show that HD 206893 B cannot be the source of this observed RV drift as
it would lead to a dynamical mass inconsistent with its photometry and spectra
and with Hipparcos and Gaia data. An additional inner (semimajor axis in the
range 1.4-2.6 au) and massive ($\sim$ 15 $M_{Jup}$) companion is needed to
explain the RV drift, which is compatible with the available astrometric data
of the star, as well as with the VLT/SPHERE and VLT/NaCo nondetection.

Kuiper belt were acquired with the Magellan-Baade telescope and combined with
colors from the literature to understand contact binary surfaces. The likely
and potential contact binaries discovered in the dynamically Cold Classical
population display very-red/ultra-red colors. Such a color is common in this
sub-population and infers that the Cold Classical contact binaries were formed
in-situ. The likely contact binaries found in several mean motion resonances
with Neptune have colors from moderately to ultra-red suggesting different
formation regions. Among the nine contact binaries discovered in resonances,
five have very-red/ultra-red colors and four have moderately-red surfaces.
Based on the very-red/ultra-red colors and low to moderate inclination of the
contact binaries in resonances, these contact binaries are maybe escaped
dynamically Cold Classicals that are now trapped in resonances. Moderately-red
surfaces are common in diverse sub-populations of the Kuiper belt and thus
pinpointing their origin is difficult though they are most likely captured
objects formed in the giant planet area. Finally, for the contact binary
population we report an anti-correlation between inclination and g'-r', as
noticed in the rest of this belt. We also have hints for trends between
eccentricity, perihelion distance, rotational period and g'-r', but as we are
still dealing with a limited sample, additional data are required to confirm
them.

Minor corrections made",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Within the ViSE (Voting in Stochastic Environment) model, we study social
dynamics determined by collective decisions in a society with an elite. The
model allows the analysis of the influence of participants' social attitudes,
such as the effects of selfishness, collectivism, lobbying, altruism, etc., on
the welfare of the society and its strata. Social dynamics is determined by the
change in capital over time, as well as the formation and dissociation of
groups. We show that the presence of a responsible elite, which partially cares
for its own benefit, stabilizes society and removes the `pit of damage'
paradox. Society's gain from having a responsible elite is comparable to that
from an altruistic group of the same size. If the responsible elite succumbs to
the temptation to dramatically increase the weight of the group component in
its combined voting strategy, then its income rises sharply, while the income
of the society decreases. The rest of the participants benefit from joining the
elite, while for the elite it is beneficial to maintain a moderate size. If, in
response to insufficient responsibility of the elite, an altruistic group
emerges that outnumbers the elite and becomes a new responsible elite, then
society again stabilizes, and monopoly of the previous elite (a `clique') ends.
If the responsible elite competing with the clique becomes a second clique,
then tough competition between the cliques is still preferable for society over
having a unique clique.

chemostat with ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for concentrations of
substrate, microorganisms, and an extracellular mediator involved in electron
transfer. There is also an algebraic constraint for electric current and
hydrogen production. Our goal is to determine the outcome of competition
between methanogenic archaea and electroactive bacteria, because only the
latter contribute to electric current and resulting hydrogen production. We
investigate asymptotic stability in two industrially relevant versions of the
model. An important aspect of chemostats models is the principle of competitive
exclusion -- only microbes which grow at the lowest substrate concentration
will survive as $t\to\infty$. We show that if methanogens grow at the lowest
substrate concentration, then the equilibrium corresponding to competitive
exclusion by methanogens is globally asymptotically stable. The analogous
result for electroactive bacteria is not necessarily true. We show that local
asymptotic stability of exclusion by electroactive bacteria is not guaranteed,
even in a simplified version of the model. In this case, even if electroactive
bacteria can grow at the lowest substrate concentration, a few additional
conditions are required to guarantee local asymptotic stability. We also
provide numerical simulations supporting these arguments. Our results suggest
operating conditions that are most conducive to success of electroactive
bacteria and the resulting current and hydrogen production in MECs. This will
help identify when methane production or electricity and hydrogen production

meaningful spatio-temporal features to capture activities, accurately
localizing the start and end times of each activity. We introduce a new model,
Region Convolutional 3D Network (R-C3D), which encodes the video streams using
a three-dimensional fully convolutional network, then generates candidate
temporal regions containing activities and finally classifies selected regions
into specific activities. Computation is saved due to the sharing of
convolutional features between the proposal and the classification pipelines.
We further improve the detection performance by efficiently integrating an
optical flow based motion stream with the original RGB stream. The two-stream
network is jointly optimized by fusing the flow and RGB feature maps at
different levels. Additionally, the training stage incorporates an online hard
example mining strategy to address the extreme foreground-background imbalance
typically observed in any detection pipeline. Instead of heuristically sampling
the candidate segments for the final activity classification stage, we rank
them according to their performance and only select the worst performers to
update the model. This improves the model without heavy hyper-parameter tuning.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets are carried out to show
superior performance over existing temporal activity detection methods. Our
model achieves state-of-the-art results on the THUMOS'14 and Charades datasets.
We further demonstrate that our model is a general temporal activity detection
framework that does not rely on assumptions about particular dataset properties

reconstruction methods for solving inverse electromagnetic source scattering
problems with multi-frequency sparse phased or phaseless far field data. With
the phased data, we show that the smallest strip containing the source support
with the observation direction as the normal can be uniquely determined by the
multi-frequency far field pattern at a single observation direction. A phased
direct sampling method is also proposed to reconstruct the strip. The phaseless
far field data is closely related to the outward energy flux, which can be
measured more easily in practice. We show that the phaseless far field data is
invariant under the translation of the sources, which implies that the location
of the sources can not be uniquely recovered by the data. To solve this
problem, we consider simultaneously the scattering of magnetic dipoles with one
fixed source point and at most three scattering strengths. With this technique,
a fast and stable phase retrieval approach is proposed based on a simple
geometrical result which provides a stable reconstruction of a point in the
plane from three distances to the given points. A novel phaseless direct
sampling method is also proposed to reconstruct the strip. The phase retrieval
approach can also be combined with the phased direct sampling method to
reconstruct the strip. Finally, to obtain a source support, we just need to
superpose the indicators with respect to the sparse observation directions.
Extended numerical examples in three dimensions are conducted with noisy data,
and the results further verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
phase retrieval approach and direct sampling methods.

improvements on previously published device identification techniques with
novel spatio-temporal correlation algorithms to perform multi-protocol entity

  modeling",,,,,"eess.SP cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) can reveal neuronal
dynamics non-invasively in real-time and are therefore appreciated methods in
medicine and neuroscience. Recent advances in modeling brain-behavior
relationships have highlighted the effectiveness of Riemannian geometry for
summarizing the spatially correlated time-series from M/EEG in terms of their
covariance. However, after artefact-suppression, M/EEG data is often rank
deficient which limits the application of Riemannian concepts. In this article,
we focus on the task of regression with rank-reduced covariance matrices. We
study two Riemannian approaches that vectorize the M/EEG covariance
between-sensors through projection into a tangent space. The Wasserstein
distance readily applies to rank-reduced data but lacks affine-invariance. This
can be overcome by finding a common subspace in which the covariance matrices
are full rank, enabling the affine-invariant geometric distance. We
investigated the implications of these two approaches in synthetic generative
models, which allowed us to control estimation bias of a linear model for
prediction. We show that Wasserstein and geometric distances allow perfect
out-of-sample prediction on the generative models. We then evaluated the
methods on real data with regard to their effectiveness in predicting age from
M/EEG covariance matrices. The findings suggest that the data-driven Riemannian
methods outperform different sensor-space estimators and that they get close to
the performance of biophysics-driven source-localization model that requires
MRI acquisitions and tedious data processing. Our study suggests that the
proposed Riemannian methods can serve as fundamental building-blocks for
automated large-scale analysis of M/EEG.

embeddings may be used in various tasks involving $\mathcal D_T$. A popular
strategy in limited data settings is to adapt pre-trained embeddings $\mathcal
E$ trained on a large corpus. To correct for sense drift, fine-tuning,
regularization, projection, and pivoting have been proposed recently. Among
these, regularization informed by a word's corpus frequency performed well, but
we improve upon it using a new regularizer based on the stability of its
cooccurrence with other words. However, a thorough comparison across ten
topics, spanning three tasks, with standardized settings of hyper-parameters,
reveals that even the best embedding adaptation strategies provide small gains
beyond well-tuned baselines, which many earlier comparisons ignored. In a bold
departure from adapting pretrained embeddings, we propose using $\mathcal D_T$
to probe, attend to, and borrow fragments from any large, topic-rich source
corpus (such as Wikipedia), which need not be the corpus used to pretrain
embeddings. This step is made scalable and practical by suitable indexing. We
reach the surprising conclusion that even limited corpus augmentation is more
useful than adapting embeddings, which suggests that non-dominant sense

cannot be salvaged by adaptation.

One major problem is that the EEG signals for seizure state and nonseizure
state exhibit considerable variations. In order to capture essential seizure
features, this paper integrates an emerging deep learning model, the
independently recurrent neural network (IndRNN), with a dense structure and an
attention mechanism to exploit temporal and spatial discriminating features and
overcome seizure variabilities. The dense structure is to ensure maximum
information flow between layers. The attention mechanism is to capture spatial

affects the classification performance. Thirteen different segment lengths are
assessed, showing that the classification performance varies over the segment
lengths, and the maximal fluctuating margin is more than 4%. Thus, the segment
length is an important factor influencing the classification performance.

showed that mutuality, popularity, assortativity, and different types of

this paper, the symmetric version of the core-cohesive blockmodel type is
proposed. This blockmodel type consists of three or more groups of units. The
units from each group are internally well linked to each other while those from
different groups are not linked to each other. This is true for all groups,

algorithm reduces the packet loss by at least 69.2%, as compared to existing
non-learning greedy algorithms.

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.NI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An accurate and fast estimation of the available bandwidth in a network with
varying cross-traffic is a challenging task. The accepted probing tools, based
on the fluid-flow model of a bottleneck link with first-in, first-out
multiplexing, estimate the available bandwidth by measuring packet dispersions.
The estimation becomes more difficult if packet dispersions deviate from the
assumptions of the fluid-flow model in the presence of non-fluid bursty
cross-traffic, multiple bottleneck links, and inaccurate time-stamping. This
motivates us to explore the use of machine learning tools for available
bandwidth estimation. Hence, we consider reinforcement learning and implement
the single-state multi-armed bandit technique, which follows the
$\epsilon$-greedy algorithm to find the available bandwidth. Our measurements
and tests reveal that our proposed method identifies the available bandwidth
with high precision. Furthermore, our method converges to the available
bandwidth under a variety of notoriously difficult conditions, such as heavy
traffic burstiness, different cross-traffic intensities, multiple bottleneck
links, and in networks where the tight link and the bottleneck link are not
same. Compared to the piece-wise linear network a model-based direct probing
technique that employs a Kalman filter, our method shows more accurate
estimates and faster convergence in certain network scenarios and does not
require measurement noise statistics.

  of P3P Problem",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traditionally the danger cylinder is intimately related to the solution
stability in P3P problem. In this work, we show that the danger cylinder is
also closely related to the multiple-solution phenomenon. More specifically, we
show when the optical center lies on the danger cylinder, of the 3 possible P3P
solutions, i.e., one double solution, and two other solutions, the optical
center of the double solution still lies on the danger cylinder, but the
optical centers of the other two solutions no longer lie on the danger
cylinder. And when the optical center moves on the danger cylinder, accordingly
the optical centers of the two other solutions of the corresponding P3P problem
form a new surface, characterized by a polynomial equation of degree 12 in the
optical center coordinates, called the Companion Surface of Danger Cylinder
(CSDC). That means the danger cylinder always has a companion surface. For the
significance of CSDC, we show that when the optical center passes through the
CSDC, the number of solutions of P3P problem must change by 2. That means CSDC
acts as a delimitating surface of the P3P solution space. These new findings
shed some new lights on the P3P multi-solution phenomenon, an important issue
in PnP study.

this work, combining several desirable properties of SNNs and self-organized
maps (SOMs). Networks are trained with biologically motivated, unsupervised
learning rules to obtain a self-organized grid of filters via cooperative and
competitive excitatory-inhibitory interactions. Several inhibition strategies
are developed and tested, such as (i) incrementally increasing inhibition level
over the course of network training, and (ii) switching the inhibition level
from low to high (two-level) after an initial training segment. During the
labeling phase, the spiking activity generated by data with known labels is
used to assign neurons to categories of data, which are then used to evaluate
the network's classification ability on a held-out set of test data. Several
biologically plausible evaluation rules are proposed and compared, including a
population-level confidence rating, and an $n$-gram inspired method. The
effectiveness of the proposed self-organized learning mechanism is tested using
the MNIST benchmark dataset, as well as using images produced by playing the
Atari Breakout game.

and recognizing their current states to share the streets with human drivers.
Most of the time, human drivers can easily identify the relevant traffic
lights. To deal with this issue, a common solution for autonomous cars is to
integrate recognition with prior maps. However, additional solution is required
for the detection and recognition of the traffic light. Deep learning
techniques have showed great performance and power of generalization including
traffic related problems. Motivated by the advances in deep learning, some
recent works leveraged some state-of-the-art deep detectors to locate (and
further recognize) traffic lights from 2D camera images. However, none of them
combine the power of the deep learning-based detectors with prior maps to
recognize the state of the relevant traffic lights. Based on that, this work
proposes to integrate the power of deep learning-based detection with the prior
maps used by our car platform IARA (acronym for Intelligent Autonomous Robotic
Automobile) to recognize the relevant traffic lights of predefined routes. The
process is divided in two phases: an offline phase for map construction and
traffic lights annotation; and an online phase for traffic light recognition
and identification of the relevant ones. The proposed system was evaluated on
five test cases (routes) in the city of Vit\'oria, each case being composed of
a video sequence and a prior map with the relevant traffic lights for the
route. Results showed that the proposed technique is able to correctly identify
the relevant traffic light along the trajectory.

algorithm exhibits several desirable properties such as a small memory

computational load makes this algorithm attractive for practical denoising
applications. We compare our method with different state-of-art algorithms,
