having stellar discs with unusually high planar-to-vertical axes ratio $b/a$
$>$ 10 - 20, the formation and evolution of which is not well-understood. We
calculate the specific angular momenta of a sample of six superthins and nine
other bulgeless LSBs using stellar photometry, atomic hydrogen (HI) surface
density and high resolution HI rotation curves available in the literature. We
find that the stellar specific angular mometum $j_{\rm{s}}$, and hence the
stellar disc size given by the exponential stellar disc scale length R$_D$, of
three superthins and seven LSBs lie above the 95.4 $\%$ confidence band of the
$j_{\rm{s}}$ - $V_{\rm{rot}}$ regression line for ordinary bulgeless disc
galaxies, $V_{\rm{rot}}$ being the asymptotic rotational velocity. Further, we
find that superthins and LSBs have higher $j_{\rm{s}}$ and R$_D$ values for a
given value of stellar mass $M_{\rm{s}}$ at high values of statistical
significance, compared to ordinary disc galaxies. Therefore, we conclude, a
superthin is may be distinguished by a characteristically larger disc size
which could possibly explain the origin of its large planar-to-vertical axes
ratio. Interestingly, we find that the median spin parameter $\lambda = \frac{
j_{\rm{stars}} } { {\sqrt(2) V_{\rm{vir}} R_{\rm{vir}} } }$, $V_{\rm{vir}}$ and
$R_{\rm{vir}}$ being the virial velocity and virial radius of the galaxy
respectively, is 0.13 $\pm$ 0.01 for superthin galaxies which is an order of
magnitude higher than those of LSBs and ordinary disc galaxies, which may have
important implications for the existence of superthin stellar discs in these
low surface brightness galaxies.

the mean momentum being independent of the vertical coordinate. The mode with
the dominant vertical vorticity can be excited in a fast rotating density

inside the anti-cyclonic vortices. The mode with the dominant horizontal

perform this task robustly. Among them, radar sensors are indispensable because
of their range resolution and the possibility to directly measure velocity.
Since more and more radar sensors are deployed on the streets, mutual
interference must be dealt with. In the so far unregulated automotive radar
frequency band, a sensor must be capable of detecting, or even mitigating the
harmful effects of interference, which include a decreased detection
sensitivity. In this paper, we address this issue with Convolutional Neural

that the ability of CNNs to find structured information in data while
preserving local information enables superior denoising performance. To achieve
this, CNN parameters are found using training with simulated data and
integrated into the automotive radar signal processing chain. The presented
method is compared with the state of the art, highlighting its promising

sedimented granular bed immersed in a fluid under steady-state conditions. At
low rod speeds, the presence of the fluid leads to a lower drag because of
buoyancy, whereas a significantly higher drag is observed with increasing
speeds. The drag as a function of depth is observed to decrease from being
quadratic at low speeds to appearing more linear at higher speeds. By scaling
the drag with the average weight of the grains acting on the rod, we obtain the
effective friction $\mu_e$ encountered over six orders of magnitude of speeds.
While a constant $\mu_e$ is found when the grain size, rod depth and fluid
viscosity are varied at low speeds, a systematic increase is observed as the
speed is increased. We analyze $\mu_e$ in terms of the inertial number $I$ and
viscous number $J$ to understand the relative importance of inertia and viscous
forces, respectively. For sufficiently large fluid viscosities, we find that
the effect of varying the speed, depth, and viscosity can be described by the
empirical function $\mu_e = \mu_o + k J^n$, where $\mu_o$ is the effective
friction measured in the quasi-static limit, and $k$ and $n$ are material
constants. The drag is then analyzed in terms of the effective viscosity
$\eta_e$ and found to decrease systematically as a function of $J$. We further
show that $\eta_e$ as a function of $J$ is directly proportional to the fluid
viscosity and the $\mu_e$ encountered by the rod.

problem to giving a quantitative result, namely, a tight polynomial upper
bound. This paper shows how to obtain asymptotically-tight, multivariate,

solution: whenever a polynomial bound exists it will be found.
  A pleasant surprise is that the algorithm is quite simple; but it relies on

considered as a golden channel to probe double parton scatterings (DPS) --in
particular to study gluon-gluon correlations inside the proton-- and, at the
same time, to measure the distribution of linearly-polarised gluons inside the
proton. Such studies however require a good control of both single and DPS in
the respective regions where they are carried out. In this context, we have
critically examined two mechanisms of single parton scatterings (SPS) that may
be kinematically enhanced where DPS are thought to be dominant, even though
they are either at higher orders in the strong-coupling or velocity expansion.
First, we have considered a gauge-invariant and infrared-safe subset of the
loop-induced contribution via Colour-Singlet (CS) transitions. We have found it
to become the leading CS SPS contributions at large rapidity separation, yet
too small to account for the data without invoking the presence of DPS yields.
Second, we have surveyed the possible Colour-Octet (CO) contributions using
both old and up-to-date non-perturbative long distance matrix elements (LDMEs).
We have found that the pure CO yields crucially depend on the LDMEs. Among all
the LDMEs we used, only two result into a visible modification of the NRQCD
(CS+CO) yield, but only in two kinematical distributions measured by ATLAS,
those of the rapidity separation and of the pair invariant mass. These
modifications however do not impact the control region used for their DPS

spheroidal filaments, accounting for their projection onto the sky. The main
tunable parameters are the distribution of filament sizes, the filament
physical aspect ratio, and the dispersion of the filament axis around the local
magnetic field direction. The abundance and properties of filaments as a
function of size determine the slopes of the foreground power spectra, as we
show via scaling arguments. The filament aspect ratio determines the ratio of
$B$-mode power to $E$-mode power, and specifically reproduces the
Planck-observed dust ratio of one-half when the short axis is roughly
one-fourth the length of the long axis. Filament misalignment to the local
magnetic field determines the $TE$ cross-correlation, and to reproduce Planck
measurements, we need a (three-dimensional) misalignment angle with a root mean
squared dispersion of about 50 degrees. These parameters are not sensitive to
the particular filament density profile. By artificially skewing the
distribution of the misalignment angle, this model can reproduce the
Planck-observed (and parity-violating) $TB$ correlation. The skewing of the

occur over finite strains, and that their amplitudes grow and then decay to
zero over a greater range of applied strains compared with linear elastic

to its width, and only over a finite range of length-to-width ratios. We show
with simulations that the Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic model describes the
observed growth and decay of the wrinkles in our experiments. The decrease of
wavelength with applied tension is found to be consistent with a
far-from-threshold scenario proposed by Cerda and Mahadevan in 2003. However,
the amplitude is observed to decrease with increasing tensile load, in contrast
with the prediction of their original model. We address the crucial assumption
of {\it collapse of compressive stress}, as opposed to collapse of compressive
strain, underlying the far-from-threshold analysis, and test it by measuring
the actual arc-length of the stretched sheet in the transverse direction and
its difference from the width of a planar projection of the wrinkled shape. Our
experiments and numerical simulations indicate a complete {\it collapse of the
compressive stress}, and reveal that a proper implementation of the
far-from-threshold analysis is consistent with the non-monotonic dependence of
the amplitude on applied tensile load observed in experiments and simulations.

observation than ordinary diffusion processes by considering convolution of
diffusion processes and some kernel functions with respect to time parameter.
We discuss the estimation and test theories for the parameter determining the
smoothness of the observation, as well as the least-square-type estimation for
the parameters in the diffusion coefficient and the drift one of the latent
diffusion process. In addition to the theoretical discussion, we also examine
the performance of the estimation and the test with computational simulation,

can be regarded as smoother one than ordinary diffusion processes with
statistical significance.

  Image Compression",,,"10.1109/TIP.2020.2985225",,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Precise estimation of the probabilistic structure of natural images plays an
essential role in image compression. Despite the recent remarkable success of
end-to-end optimized image compression, the latent codes are usually assumed to
be fully statistically factorized in order to simplify entropy modeling.
However, this assumption generally does not hold true and may hinder
compression performance. Here we present context-based convolutional networks
(CCNs) for efficient and effective entropy modeling. In particular, a 3D zigzag
scanning order and a 3D code dividing technique are introduced to define proper
coding contexts for parallel entropy decoding, both of which boil down to place
translation-invariant binary masks on convolution filters of CCNs. We
demonstrate the promise of CCNs for entropy modeling in both lossless and lossy
image compression. For the former, we directly apply a CCN to the binarized
representation of an image to compute the Bernoulli distribution of each code
for entropy estimation. For the latter, the categorical distribution of each
code is represented by a discretized mixture of Gaussian distributions, whose
parameters are estimated by three CCNs. We then jointly optimize the CCN-based
entropy model along with analysis and synthesis transforms for rate-distortion
performance. Experiments on the Kodak and Tecnick datasets show that our
methods powered by the proposed CCNs generally achieve comparable compression
performance to the state-of-the-art while being much faster.

coincides with a supermassive black hole. Observational mm-VLBI campaigns are
capable of resolving the jet-launching region at the scale of the event
horizon. In order to provide a context for interpreting these observations,
realistic general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) models of the
accretion flow are constructed. The characteristics of the observed
spectral-energy distribution (SED) depend on the shape of the electrons'
energy-distribution function (eDF). The dependency on the eDF is omitted in the
modeling of the first Event Horizon Telescope results. In this work, we aim to
model the M 87 SED from radio up to NIR/optical frequencies using a
thermal-relativistic Maxwell- J\""uttner distribution, as well as a relativistic
$\kappa$-distribution function. The electrons are injected based on sub-grid,
particle-in-cell parametrizations for sub-relativistic reconnection. A GRMHD
simulation in Cartesian-Kerr-Schild coordinates, using eight levels of adaptive
mesh refinement (AMR), forms the basis of our model. To obtain spectra and
images, the GRMHD data is post-processed with the ray-tracing code RAPTOR,
which is capable of ray tracing through AMR GRMHD simulation data. We obtain
radio spectra in both the thermal-jet and $\kappa$-jet models consistent with
radio observations. Additionally, the $\kappa$-jet models also recover the
NIR/optical emission. The models recover the observed source sizes and core
shifts and obtain a jet power of $\approx 10^{43}$ ergs/s. In the $\kappa$-jet
models, both the accretion rates and jet powers are approximately two times
lower than the thermal-jet model. The frequency cut-off observed at $\nu
\approx 10^{15}$ Hz is recovered when the accelerator size is $10^6$ - $10^8$
cm, this could potentially point to an upper limit for plasmoid sizes in the

the dynamics of collective response and pattern formation. Here, we use a model
organism, Caenorhabditis elegans, to study the direct relation between oxygen

bacteria-mediated decrease in oxygen levels slowed down the animals and
triggers motility-induced phase separation. Three coupled factors bacterial
accumulation, aerotaxis, and population density act together and control the
dynamics of pattern formation. Through several intermediate stages, aggregates
converge to a large scale swarming phase and collectively move across the

differences resulting from the genetic variations and oxygen sensitivity.
Altogether, our study provides many physical insights and a new platform for

strain-engineerable bandgap that has been used to induce static exciton flux in
predetermined structures. However, dynamic control of exciton flux represents
an outstanding challenge. Here, we introduce a method to tune the bandgap of
suspended 2D semiconductors by applying a local strain gradient with a
nanoscale tip. This strain allows us to locally and reversibly shift the
exciton energy and to steer the exciton flux over micron-scale distances, as
observed by wide-field imaging and time-resolved photoluminescence
spectroscopy. We anticipate that the ability to strongly and dynamically
modulate the bandgap of a semiconductor at the nanoscale not only marks an
important experimental tool but will also open a broad range of new
applications from information processing to energy conversion.

  Komm and David Wehner","Finding Optimal Solutions With Neighborly Help",,,,,"cs.CC cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Can we efficiently compute optimal solutions to instances of a hard problem
from optimal solutions to neighboring (i.e., locally modified) instances? For
example, can we efficiently compute an optimal coloring for a graph from
optimal colorings for all one-edge-deleted subgraphs? Studying such questions
not only gives detailed insight into the structure of the problem itself, but
also into the complexity of related problems; most notably graph theory's core
notion of critical graphs (e.g., graphs whose chromatic number decreases under
deletion of an arbitrary edge) and the complexity-theoretic notion of
minimality problems (also called criticality problems, e.g., recognizing graphs
that become 3-colorable when an arbitrary edge is deleted).
  We focus on two prototypical graph problems, Colorability and Vertex Cover.
For example, we show that it is NP-hard to compute an optimal coloring for a
graph from optimal colorings for all its one-vertex-deleted subgraphs, and that
this remains true even when optimal solutions for all one-edge-deleted
subgraphs are given. In contrast, computing an optimal coloring from all (or
even just two) one-edge-added supergraphs is in P. We observe that Vertex Cover
exhibits a remarkably different behavior, demonstrating the power of our model
to delineate problems from each other more precisely on a structural level.
  Moreover, we provide a number of new complexity results for minimality and
criticality problems. For example, we prove that Minimal-3-UnColorability is
complete for DP (differences of NP sets), which was previously known only for
the more amenable case of deleting vertices rather than edges. For Vertex
Cover, we show that recognizing beta-vertex-critical graphs is complete for
Theta_2^p (parallel access to NP), obtaining the first completeness result for
a criticality problem for this class.

is the pile of cash that funds margin loans to retail clients (read: continuous
time Kelly gamblers). Call money is assumed to supply itself perfectly
inelastically, and to continuously reinvest all principal and interest. I show
that the relative size of the money market (that is, relative to the Kelly
bankroll) is a martingale that nonetheless converges in probability to zero.
The margin loan interest rate is a submartingale that converges in mean square
to the choke price $r_\infty:=\nu-\sigma^2/2$, where $\nu$ is the asymptotic
compound growth rate of the stock market and $\sigma$ is its annual volatility.
In this environment, the gambler no longer beats the market asymptotically a.s.
by an exponential factor (as he would under perfectly elastic supply). Rather,
he beats the market asymptotically with very high probability (think 98%) by a
factor (say 1.87, or 87% more final wealth) whose mean cannot exceed what the
leverage ratio was at the start of the model (say, $2:1$). Although the ratio
of the gambler's wealth to that of an equivalent buy-and-hold investor is a
submartingale (always expected to increase), his realized compound growth rate
converges in mean square to $\nu$. This happens because the equilibrium
leverage ratio converges to $1:1$ in lockstep with the gradual rise of margin
loan interest rates.

maximizes the reduction in sum of squares error (the impurity) along a
particular variable. This paper aims to study the bias and adaptive properties

interesting connection between the bias and the mean decrease in impurity (MDI)

theoretically that decision trees with CART have small bias and are adaptive to
signal strength and direction. Finally, we apply these individual tree bounds
to tree ensembles and show consistency of Breiman's random forests. The context
is surprisingly general and applies to a wide variety of multivariable data
generating distributions and regression functions. The main technical tool is
an exact characterization of the conditional probability content of the

state-of-the-art methods fail to provide high level of recognition accuracy. As
with many other visual recognition tasks, kinship verification may benefit from

we address, for the first time, the use of audio-visual information from face

multi-modal kinship dataset, called TALking KINship (TALKIN), that contains
several pairs of Internet-quality video sequences. Using TALKIN, we then study
the utility of various kinship verification methods including traditional local

approaches. Then, early and late fusion methods are evaluated on the TALKIN
dataset for the study of kinship verification with both face and voice
modalities. Finally, we propose a deep Siamese fusion network with contrastive
loss for multi-modal fusion of kinship relations. Extensive experiments on the
TALKIN dataset indicate that by combining face and voice modalities, the
proposed Siamese network can provide a significantly higher level of accuracy
compared to baseline uni-modal and multi-modal fusion techniques. Experimental
results also indicate that audio (vocal) information is complementary (to
facial information) and useful for kinship verification.

control architectures that sequentially invoke primitives and achieve error
correction through the use of loops and conditionals taking the system back to
alternative earlier states. Recent end-to-end approaches to task learning
attempt to directly learn a single controller that solves an entire task, but
this has been difficult for complex control tasks that would have otherwise
required a diversity of local primitive moves, and the resulting solutions are
also not easy to inspect for plan monitoring purposes. In this work, we aim to
bridge the gap between hand designed and learned controllers, by representing
each as an option in a hybrid hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework -
DynoPlan. We extend the options framework by adding a dynamics model and the
use of a nearness-to-goal heuristic, derived from demonstrations. This
translates the optimization of a hierarchical policy controller to a problem of
planning with a model predictive controller. By unrolling the dynamics of each
option and assessing the expected value of each future state, we can create a
simple switching controller for choosing the optimal policy within a
constrained time horizon similarly to hill climbing heuristic search. The
individual dynamics model allows each option to iterate and be activated
independently of the specific underlying instantiation, thus allowing for a mix
of motion planning and deep neural network based primitives. We can assess the
safety regions of the resulting hybrid controller by investigating the
initiation sets of the different options, and also by reasoning about the
completeness and performance guarantees of the underpinning motion planners.

obtain the EM field of a certain rotating charge distribution which we term
$\sqrt{\rm Kerr}$. In this note, we identify the origin of this shift as
arising from the exponentiation of spin operators for the recently defined
""minimally coupled"" three-particle amplitudes of spinning particles coupled to
gravity, in the large-spin limit. We demonstrate this by studying the impulse
imparted to a test particle in the background of the heavy spinning particle.
We first consider the electromagnetic case, where the impulse due to $\sqrt{\rm

derived from the gravitationally coupled spinning particle via the double copy.

weaker than classical entailment, it allows for a powerful model theoretic
framework for answering queries while requiring minimal assumptions about the

conception of $(\delta, L)$-model is based on the conception of $(\delta,
L)$-oracle which was proposed by Devolder-Glineur-Nesterov, herewith the
authors proposed approximate a function with an upper bound using a convex
quadratic function with some additive noise $\delta$. They managed to get
convex quadratic upper bounds with noise even for nonsmooth functions. The
conception of $(\delta, L)$-model continues this idea by using instead of a
convex quadratic function a more complex convex function in an upper bound.
Possibility to recover the solution of a dual problem gives great benefits in
different problems, for instance, in some cases, it is faster to find a
solution in a primal problem than in a dual problem. Note that primal-dual
methods are well studied, but usually each class of optimization problems has
its own primal-dual method. Our goal is to develop a method which can find
solutions in different classes of optimization problems. This is realized
through the use of the conception of $(\delta, L)$-model and adaptive structure
of our methods. Thereby, we developed primal-dual adaptive gradient method and
fast gradient method with $(\delta, L)$-model and proved convergence rates of
the methods, moreover, for some classes of optimization problems the rates are
optimal. The main idea is the following: we find a dual solution to an
approximation of a primal problem using the conception of $(\delta, L)$-model.
It is much easier to find a solution to an approximated problem, however, we
have to do it in each step of our method, thereby the principle of ""divide and

have modeled the infrared emission as coming from a warp composed of an
optically thick wall and an optically thick asymmetric disk beyond this
location. We have modeled the optical emission mainly by partial stellar
occultation by the warp. Results: The magnitude amplitude of the CoRoT and
Spitzer observations for all the objects can be described with the emission
coming from the system components. The difference between them is the value of
the disk flux compared with the wall flux and the azimuthal variations of the

bioglass and related compositions are promising materials for the replacement,

details of their atomic structure remain unclear. This is partially due to the
non-equilibrium nature of glasses, as their non-crystalline structure is highly
dependent on their thermal history, namely, the cooling rate used during
quenching. Herein, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and magic angle
spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) spectroscopy experiments, we
investigate the structure of the nominal 45S5 bioglass composition prepared
using cooling rates ranging over several orders of magnitude. We show that the
simulations results are in very good agreement with experimental data, provided
that they are extrapolated toward lower cooling rates achieved in experiments.
These results highlight that previously reported inconsistencies between
simulations and experiments stem from the difference in cooling rate, thereby
addressing one of the longstanding questions on the structure of bioglass.
Based on these results, we demonstrate the existence of a Si--P avoidance
behavior, which may be key in controlling the bioactivity of 45S5 bioglass.

exhibit higher rank Yukawa matrices from multiple geometric contributions known
as Yukawa points. The holomorphic couplings furthermore have large hierarchies
for generic complex structure moduli. Unlike local considerations, the compact
setup realizes these features all through geometry, and requires no instanton
corrections. As an example, we consider a concrete toy model with $SU(5) \times
U(1)$ gauge symmetry. From the geometry, we find two Yukawa points for the
${\bf 10}_{-2} \, \bar{\bf 5}_6 \, \bar{\bf 5}_{-4}$ coupling, producing a rank
two Yukawa matrix. Our methods allow us to track all complex structure
dependencies of the holomorphic couplings and study the ratio numerically. This
reveals hierarchies of ${\cal O}(10^5)$ and larger on a full-dimensional

mass at which the white dwarf explodes during a typical SN Ia. We fit a simple
bi-linear model to the evolution of [X/Fe] with [Fe/H], where X represents each

theoretical supernova yields to isolate what fraction of the elements
originated in SNe Ia. Then, we infer the [X/Fe] yield of SNe Ia for all of the
elements except Mg. We compare these observationally inferred yields to recent
theoretical predictions for two classes of Chandrasekhar-mass (M_Ch) SN Ia as
well as sub-M_Ch SNe Ia. Most of the inferred SN Ia yields are consistent with
all of the theoretical models, but [Ni/Fe] is consistent only with sub-M_Ch

the proposed Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC), a high-energy lepton-proton

order of magnitude in comparison to state-of-the-art global fits. In comparison
to the HL-LHC projections, the PDF constraints from the LHeC are in general
more significant for small and intermediate values of the momentum fraction x.
At higher values of x, the impact of the LHeC and HL-LHC data is expected to be
of a comparable size, with the HL-LHC constraints being more competitive in
some cases, and the LHeC ones in others. Our results illustrate the encouraging
complementarity of the HL-LHC and the LHeC in terms of charting the quark and

$50<s/{\rm AU}<50,000$. A well-understood selection function allows us to
constrain p(q) in 35 independent bins of primary mass and separation, with
hundreds to thousands of binaries in each bin. Our investigation reveals a
sharp excess of equal-mass ""twin"" binaries that is statistically significant
out to separations of 1,000 to 10,000 AU, depending on primary mass. The excess
is narrow: a steep increase in p(q) at $0.95 \lesssim q<1$, with no significant
excess at $q\lesssim 0.95$. A range of tests confirm the signal is real, not a
data artifact or selection effect. Combining the Gaia constraints with those
from close binaries, we show that the twin excess decreases with increasing
separation, but its width ($q\gtrsim 0.95$) is constant over $0.01<a/{\rm

components of all wide binaries formed via core fragmentation, which is not
expected to produce strongly correlated component masses. We conjecture that
wide twins formed at closer separations ($a \lesssim 100$ AU), likely via
accretion from circumbinary disks, and were subsequently widened by dynamical
interactions in their birth environments. The separation-dependence of the twin
excess then constrains the efficiency of dynamical widening and disruption of
binaries in young clusters. We also constrain p(q) across $0.1 \lesssim q<1$.
Besides changes in the twin fraction, p(q) is independent of separation at
fixed primary mass over $100 \lesssim s/{\rm AU} < 50,000$. It is flatter than
expected for random pairings from the IMF but more bottom-heavy for wide

material that has been infalling rapidly along the dust lanes of the Milky Way
bar and material that belongs to one of the following two categories: (i)
material that has `overshot' after falling down the dust lanes on the opposite
side; (ii) material which is part of the CMZ. Both types of collisions involve
gas with large differences in the line-of-sight velocities, which is what
produces the observed extreme velocity dispersions. Examples of both categories
can be identified in the observations. If our interpretation is correct, we are

with expectations from thin disk accretion models. But the existence of billion
solar-mass SMBHs powering quasars at $z > 7$ challenges this picture: provided
they respect the Eddington limit, there is not enough time to grow $z>7$ SMBHs
from stellar remnant seeds unless the radiative efficiency is below 10\%. Here
we show that one can constrain the radiative efficiencies of the most distant
quasars known using foreground neutral intergalactic gas as a
cosmological-scale ionizing photon counter. From the Ly$\alpha$ absorption
profiles of ULAS J1120+0641 ($z=7.09$) and ULAS J1342+0928 ($z=7.54$), we
determine posterior median radiative efficiencies of 0.08\% and 0.1\%,
respectively, and the combination of the two measurements rule out the
canonical 10\% efficiency at 99.8\% credibility after marginalizing over the
unknown obscured fraction. This low radiative efficiency implies rapid mass
accretion for the earliest SMBHs, greatly easing the tension between the age of
the Universe and the SMBH masses. However, our measured efficiency may instead
reflect nearly complete obscuration by dusty gas in the quasar host galaxies
over the vast majority of their SMBH growth. Assuming 10\% efficiency during
unobscured phases, we find that the obscured fraction would be $>82\%$ at 95\%
credibility, and imply a $25.7^{+49.6}_{-16.5}$ times larger obscured than
unobscured luminous quasar population at $z>7$.

Especially, there exists a symmetric and featureless ""pseudogap metal"" with

galaxy's star formation rate is set by the balance between energy injected by
feedback from massive stars and energy lost by the deepening of the potential
of its host dark matter halo due to cosmological accretion. Such a balance is
secularly stable provided that the star formation rate increases with the
pressure in the star forming gas. The $I\kappa\epsilon\alpha$ model has four
parameters that together control the feedback from star formation and the
cosmological accretion rate onto a halo. $I\kappa\epsilon\alpha$ reproduces
accurately the star formation rate as a function of halo mass and redshift in
the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation, even when all four parameters are held
constant. It predicts the emergence of a star forming main sequence along which
the specific star formation rate depends weakly on stellar mass with an
amplitude that increases rapidly with redshift. We briefly discuss the emerging
mass-metallicity relation, the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function,
and an extension of the model that includes feedback from active galactic
nuclei (AGN). These self-regulation results are independent of the star
formation law and the galaxy's gas content. Instead, star forming galaxies are
shaped by the balance between stellar feedback and cosmological accretion, with
accurately accounting for energy losses associated with feedback a crucial

variability is continuous and apparently stochastic, disfavoring an origin as a
discrete event such as a tidal disruption flare or microlensing event. It is
coordinated on day timescales with blue leading red, consistent with
reprocessing powering the entire optical SED. We show that this process cannot
work in a standard thin disk geometry on energetic grounds, and would instead
require a large covering factor reprocessor. Disk instability models could
potentially also explain the data, provided that the instability sets in near
the inner radius of a geometrically thick accretion disk.

at generic fillings, but is interrupted by the insulator at commensurate
fillings. Importantly, the insulator forms because of electron-electron
interactions, but the model is agnostic as to the superconducting pairing
mechanism, which need not originate with electron-electron interactions. The
model is composed of a collection of crossed one-dimensional quantum wires
whose intersections form a superlattice. At each superlattice point, we place a
locally superconducting puddle which can exchange Cooper pairs with the quantum
wires. We analyze this model assuming weak wire-puddle and wire-wire couplings.
We show that for a range of repulsive intrawire interactions, the system is
superconducting at `generic' incommensurate fillings, with the
superconductivity being `interrupted' by an insulating phase at commensurate
fillings. We further show that the gapped insulating states at commensurate
fillings give way to gapless states upon application of external Zeeman fields.
These features are consistent with experimental observations in magic-angle
twisted bilayer graphenes despite the distinct microscopic details. We further
study the full phase diagram of this model and discover that it contains
several distinct correlated insulating states, which we characterize herein.

(WDs), neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). The overall merger rates for
WD-WD, NS-NS, BH-BH, BH-NS binaries and EBBH (eccentric binaries of black
holes) from redshift $\sim 5$ are found to be $4.32\times 10^3\,{\rm

with respect to the host galaxies of the binaries. The distribution shows a
wide range of distances up to $\sim$Mpc; this tail is produced by escaped
hyper-velocity CO binaries. Due to the differences in the matter density of the
surrounding environment, merger events with different $R$ are expected to
display significantly different signatures in their EM counterparts. In
particular, merger events (and especially NS-NS) producing a relativistic jet
but occurring in the intergalactic medium will have very weak afterglow
radiation relative to their prompt emission. These events, which we call
'off-center', can only be produced from a close encounter between CO binaries

existence of nearby SMBHBs, and in particular with high mass ratio, produced in

that the accurate conservation of momentum is required for reliable numerical
modelings of CCSN dynamics including a recoil of proto-neutron star (PNS). The
new method is built on a hybrid approach, in which we use the energy-momentum
tensor of neutrinos to compute the momentum feedback from neutrino to matter in
the optically thick region while we employ the collision term in the optically
thin region. In this method we utilize a general relativistic description of
radiation-hydrodynamics with angular moments, which allows us to evaluate the
momentum feedback from neutrino to matter without inconsistency with our
Boltzmann solver. We demonstrate that the new method substantially improves the
accuracy of linear momentum conservation in our CCSN simulations under
reasonable angular resolutions in momentum space, alleviating the difficulty in
giving the diffusion limit precisely with the discrete ordinate (Sn) method. It
is the first-ever demonstration that the PNS kick can be handled directly and

providing a calibration source to remove telluric variations. In addition, we
present a detailed characterization of the host stellar system. We use

huge drop in performance when evaluated on data outside their training set
distribution. This critical issue makes them unsuitable for real-world

  We propose RUBi, a new learning strategy to reduce biases in any VQA model.
It reduces the importance of the most biased examples, i.e. examples that can
be correctly classified without looking at the image. It implicitly forces the
VQA model to use the two input modalities instead of relying on statistical
regularities between the question and the answer. We leverage a question-only
model that captures the language biases by identifying when these unwanted
regularities are used. It prevents the base VQA model from learning them by
influencing its predictions. This leads to dynamically adjusting the loss in
order to compensate for biases. We validate our contributions by surpassing the
current state-of-the-art results on VQA-CP v2. This dataset is specifically
designed to assess the robustness of VQA models when exposed to different
question biases at test time than what was seen during training.

  Weighted Imaging",,,,,"physics.med-ph eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: To introduce a fast and improved direct reconstruction method for
multi-shot diffusion weighted (msDW) scans for high-resolution studies.
  Methods:Multi-shot EPI methods can enable higher spatial resolution for
diffusion MRI studies. Traditionally, such acquisitions required specialized
reconstructions involving phase compensation to correct for inter-shot motion
artifacts. The recently proposed MUSSELS reconstruction belongs to a new class
of parallel imaging-based methods that recover artifact-free DWIs from msDW
data without needing phase compensation. However, computational demands of the
MUSSELS reconstruction scales as the matrix size and the number of shots
increases, which hinders its practical utility for high-resolution
applications. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient formulation
using iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) method. The new formulation is
not only fast but it enables to accommodate additional priors such as conjugate
symmetry property of the k-space data to improve the reconstruction. Using
whole-brain in-vivo data, we show the utility of the new formulation for
routine high-resolution studies with minimal computational burden.
  Results: The IRLS formulation provides about six times faster reconstruction
for matrix sizes 192x192 and 256x256, compared to the original implementations.
The reconstruction quality is improved by the addition of conjugate symmetry
priors that reduce blurring and preserves the high-resolution details from
partial Fourier acquisitions.
  Conclusion: The proposed method is shown to be computationally efficient to
enable routine high-resolution studies. The computational complexity matches
the traditional msDWI reconstruction methods and provides improved
reconstruction results.

of the best splitting variable from the available covariates and the
corresponding split point. Early tree algorithms (e.g., AID, CART) employed
greedy search strategies, directly comparing all possible split points in all
available covariates. However, subsequent research showed that this is biased
towards selecting covariates with more potential split points. Therefore,
unbiased recursive partitioning algorithms have been suggested (e.g., QUEST,
GUIDE, CTree, MOB) that first select the covariate based on statistical
inference using p-values that are adjusted for the possible split points. In a
second step a split point optimizing some objective function is selected in the
chosen split variable. However, different unbiased tree algorithms obtain these
p-values from different inference frameworks and their relative advantages or
disadvantages are not well understood, yet. Therefore, three different popular
approaches are considered here: classical categorical association tests (as in
GUIDE), conditional inference (as in CTree), and parameter instability tests
(as in MOB). First, these are embedded into a common inference framework
encompassing parametric model trees, in particular linear model trees. Second,
it is assessed how different building blocks from this common framework affect
the power of the algorithms to select the appropriate covariates for splitting:
observation-wise goodness-of-fit measure (residuals vs. model scores),
dichotomization of residuals/scores at zero, and binning of possible split
variables. This shows that specifically the goodness-of-fit measure is crucial
for the power of the procedures, with model scores without dichotomization
performing much better in many scenarios.

in-phase-and-quadrature-phase imbalance (IQI). To address this timely concern,
we present a new nontrivial closed-form expression for the globally-optimal
least-squares estimator (LSE) for the IQI-influenced channel between a
multiantenna transmitter and single-antenna IoT device. Thereafter, to maximize
the realistic transmit beamforming gains, a novel precoder design is derived
that accounts for the underlying IQI for maximizing received power in both
single and multiuser settings. Lastly, the simulation results, demonstrating a
significant -8dB improvement in the mean-squared error of the proposed LSE over
existing benchmarks, show that the optimal precoder designing is more critical
than accurately estimating IQI-impaired channels. Also, the proposed
jointly-optimal LSE and beamformer outperforms the existing designs by
providing 24% enhancement in the mean signal power received under IQI.

corresponding input voxel belongs to a seed. This deep regression model
significantly suppresses image artifacts and makes the post-processing much
easier and more controllable. The proposed method is validated on a large

communicating objectives to them. Traditional skill learning has revolved
around reinforcement and imitation learning, each with rigid constraints on the
format of information exchanged between the human and the agent. While scalar
rewards carry little information, demonstrations require significant effort to
provide and may carry more information than is necessary. Furthermore, rewards
and demonstrations are often defined and collected before training begins, when
the human is most uncertain about what information would help the agent. In
contrast, when humans communicate objectives with each other, they make use of
a large vocabulary of informative behaviors, including non-verbal
communication, and often communicate throughout learning, responding to
observed behavior. In this way, humans communicate intent with minimal effort.
In this paper, we propose such interactive learning as an alternative to reward
or demonstration-driven learning. To accomplish this, we introduce a
multi-agent training framework that enables an agent to learn from another
agent who knows the current task. Through a series of experiments, we
demonstrate the emergence of a variety of interactive learning behaviors,
including information-sharing, information-seeking, and question-answering.
Most importantly, we find that our approach produces an agent that is capable
of learning interactively from a human user, without a set of explicit
demonstrations or a reward function, and achieving significantly better
performance cooperatively with a human than a human performing the task alone.

magnetic field measurements remain an outstanding challenge. Computational
models of coronal magnetic fields serve an important purpose in this context.
Earlier work has demonstrated that the large-scale coronal field is governed by
slow surface flux evolution and memory build-up which allows for prediction of
the coronal structure on solar rotational timescales. Utilizing this idea and
based upon a 51 day forward run of a data-driven solar surface flux transport

control of these instabilities through direct coupling between microscopic
degrees of freedom, resulting from orientational ordering of rod-like

reduction, we construct a plate theory for thin sheets of nematic elastomer. We
then apply this theory to the study of the formation of wrinkles due to
compression of a thin sheet of nematic liquid crystal elastomer atop an elastic

is found to be non-monotonic in the compressive strain owing to the presence of

have more ECUs and coupling between them due to the vast array of additional

astronomical spectra of an intrinsically scalable, integrated superconducting

the signal in a single, small superconducting integrated circuit. We
demonstrate the two key applications for an instrument of this type: as an
efficient redshift machine, and as a fast multi-line spectral mapper of
extended areas. The line detection sensitivity is in excellent agreement with
the instrument design and laboratory performance, reaching the atmospheric
foreground photon noise limit on sky. The design can be scaled to bandwidths in
excess of an octave, spectral resolution up to a few thousand and frequencies
up to $\sim$1.1 THz. The miniature chip footprint of a few $\mathrm{cm^2}$

distance of its endpoints, $\sum_{i = 1}^{n-1} |p_i p_{i+1}|/|p_1 p_n|$. For a
parameter $c \geq 1$, we call $P$ a $c$-chain if $|p_ip_j|+|p_jp_k| \leq
c|p_ip_k|$, for every triple $(i,j,k)$, $1 \leq i<j<k \leq n$. The stretch
factor is a global property: it measures how close $P$ is to a straight line,
and it involves all the vertices of $P$; being a $c$-chain, on the other hand,
is a fingerprint-property: it only depends on subsets of $O(1)$ vertices of the

  We investigate how the $c$-chain property influences the stretch factor in
the plane: (i) we show that for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there is a noncrossing
$c$-chain that has stretch factor $\Omega(n^{1/2-\varepsilon})$, for
sufficiently large constant $c=c(\varepsilon)$; (ii) on the other hand, the
stretch factor of a $c$-chain $P$ is $O\left(n^{1/2}\right)$, for every
constant $c\geq 1$, regardless of whether $P$ is crossing or noncrossing; and
(iii) we give a randomized algorithm that can determine, for a polygonal chain
$P$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with $n$ vertices, the minimum $c\geq 1$ for which $P$ is
a $c$-chain in $O\left(n^{2.5}\ \mathrm{polylog}\ n\right)$ expected time and
$O(n\log n)$ space. These results generalize to $\mathbb{R}^d$. For every
dimension $d\geq 2$ and every $\varepsilon>0$, we construct a noncrossing
$c$-chain that has stretch factor
$\Omega\left(n^{(1-\varepsilon)(d-1)/d}\right)$; on the other hand, the stretch
factor of any $c$-chain is $O\left((n-1)^{(d-1)/d}\right)$; for every $c>1$, we

electron dynamics in atoms and molecules with unprecedented resolution.
Extending the techniques developed originally for atomic and molecular gases to
solid state materials requires a fundamental understanding of the physics that
has been partially addressed theoretically. Here we employ time-dependent
density-functional theory to investigate how the electron dynamics resulting in
high-harmonic emission in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride is affected by the
presence of vacancies. We show how these realistic spin-polarised defects
modify the harmonic emission, and demonstrate that important differences exist
between harmonics from a pristine solid and a defected-solid. In particular, we
found that the different spin channels are affected differently because of the
presence of the spin-polarized point defect, and that localisation of the
wavefunction, the geometry of the defect and the electron-electron interaction
are all important ingredients to describe high-harmonic generation in
defected-solids. We show that different vacancies lead to qualitatively
different effects, thus opening the door to the high-harmonic imaging of
spin-polarised defects in solids.

Unfortunately, such sum rules have proven difficult to study in a cosmological

inflation in anti-de Sitter spacetime, where it becomes dual to a slow
renormalization group flow in the boundary quantum field theory. This dual
description provides a firm footing for exploring the constraints of unitarity,
analyticity, and causality on the bulk effective field theory. We derive a sum
rule that constrains the bulk coupling constants in this theory. In the bulk,
the sum rule is related to the speed of radial propagation, while on the
boundary, it governs the spreading of nonlocal operators. When the spreading
speed approaches the speed of light, the sum rule is saturated, suggesting that
the theory becomes free in this limit. We also discuss whether similar results
apply to inflation, where an analogous sum rule exists for the propagation

did not address the differences between classes of social engineering attacks.
In this paper, we present a novel framework designed for evaluating the ISA of

questionnaires, the proposed framework utilizes objective data sources: a
mobile agent and a network traffic monitor; both of which are used to analyze
the actual behavior of users. We empirically evaluated the ISA scores assessed
from the three data sources (namely, the questionnaires, mobile agent, and
network traffic monitor) by conducting a long-term user study involving 162
smartphone users. All participants were exposed to four different security
challenges that resemble real-life social engineering attacks. These challenges
were used to assess the ability of the proposed framework to derive a relevant
ISA score. The results of our experiment show that: (1) the self-reported
behavior of the users differs significantly from their actual behavior; and (2)
ISA scores derived from data collected by the mobile agent or the network
traffic monitor are highly correlated with the users' success in mitigating
social engineering attacks.

double-beta decay of the promising nuclei $^{100}$Mo and $^{130}$Te. The
limiting factor in large-scale bolometric searches for this rare process is the
background induced by surface radioactive contamination, as shown by the
results of the CUORE experiment. The basic concept of CROSS consists of
rejecting this challenging background component by pulse-shape discrimination,
assisted by a proper coating of the faces of the crystal containing the isotope
of interest and serving as energy absorber of the bolometric detector. In this
paper, we demonstrate that ultra-pure superconductive Al films deposited on the
crystal surfaces act successfully as pulse-shape modifiers, both with fast and

radioactivity have been demonstrated in a series of prototypes based on
crystals of Li$_2$MoO$_4$ and TeO$_2$. We have also shown that point-like
energy depositions can be identified up to a distance of $\sim 1$ mm from the

radiative cooling alters noticeably the shock dynamics and inhibits the
Sedov-Taylor stage, thus limiting significantly the feedback that SNRs provide
to such environments. For $n_{0}>5 \times 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$, the reverse shock
does not reach the center of the explosion due to the rapid fall of the thermal
pressure in the shocked gas caused by strong radiative cooling.

explain AI decisions to various stakeholders. State-of-the-art explainable AI
systems mostly serve AI engineers and offer little to no value to business
decision makers, customers, and other stakeholders. Towards addressing this
gap, in this work we consider the scenario of explaining loan denials. We build
the first-of-its-kind dataset that is representative of loan-applicant friendly
explanations. We design a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that can
accommodate smaller datasets, to generate user-friendly textual explanations.
We demonstrate how our system can also generate explanations serving different
purposes: those that help educate the loan applicants, or help them take
appropriate action towards a future approval.

vertices of G to the non-negative integers such that f(v) does not exceed e(v)
(the eccentricity of v) for each vertex v. If G is disconnected, we define a
broadcast on G as the union of broadcasts on its components. In a search for
the best way to generalise the concept of independent sets in graphs to
independent broadcasts, there are several ways to look at an independent set X
of a graph G. One way is from the point of view of the vertices in X: no two
vertices are adjacent -- the usual definition. Another way is from the point of
view of the edges of G: no edge is incident with (or covered by) more than one
vertex in X. Using the latter approach we define boundary independent
broadcasts as an alternative to independent broadcasts as defined by D. Erwin
[Cost domination in graphs, Doctoral dissertation, Western Michigan University,
2001], which we refer to here as hearing or h-independent broadcasts. We
compare the boundary independence broadcast number to the independence number
and the h-independence broadcast number and show that the differences can be
arbitrary, while the ratios are bounded; the bounds we present are
asymptotically best possible. We also show that, although the difference
between the boundary independence broadcast number and the independence number
can be arbitrary for trees, they are equal for any 2-connected bipartite graph.
We prove a tight upper bound for the boundary independence number and
characterise graphs for which equality holds. Using this bound and the
established ratio we obtain a new tight upper bound for Erwin's h-independence
broadcast number.

diffusion-based molecular communication. In real biological systems, the
degradation of the remaining molecules from a previous transmission is used to
mitigate ISI. While most prior works have proposed the use of enzymes to
catalyze the molecule degradation, enzymes also degrade the molecules carrying
the information, which drastically decreases the signal strength. In this
paper, we propose the use of photolysis reactions, which use the light to
instantly transform the emitted molecules so they are no longer recognized
after their detection. The light is emitted at an optimal time, allowing the
receiver to detect as many molecules as possible, which increases both the
signal strength and ISI mitigation. A lower bound expression on the expected
number of the observed molecules at the receiver is derived. The bit error
probability expression is also formulated. Both the expected number of observed
molecules and the bit error expressions are validated with simulation results,
which show a visible enhancement when using photolysis reactions. The
performance of the proposed method is evaluated using the
Interference-to-Total-Received molecules metric (ITR) and the derived bit error

the host galaxy and outflowing components. Using Gemini integral field
spectroscopy (IFS) data, we study the ionization properties of these two
components in four nearby ($z \lesssim$ 0.2) radio-quiet Type 1 quasars.
Emission line ratios and widths are employed to identify the dominant
ionization mechanisms for the host and outflow components in each object. We
find that photoionization by the AGN often dominates the ionization of both
gaseous components in these systems. In three cases, the outflowing gas is more
highly ionized than the gas in the host, indicating that it is more strongly
exposed to the ionizing radiation field of the AGN. In two objects, a positive
correlation between the line widths and line ratios in the outflowing gas
component indicates that shocks with velocities of order 100 $-$ 500 km
s$^{-1}$ may also be contributing to the ionization and heating of the
outflowing gas component. The line ratios in the outflowing gas of one of these
two objects also suggest a significant contribution from photoionization by
hot, young stars in the portion of the outflow that is closest to star-forming
regions in the host galaxy component. The data thus favor photoionization by
hot stars in the host galaxy rather than stars formed in the outflow itself.

resources to agents. We consider a specific setting, usually referred to as a
housing market, where each agent must receive exactly one resource (and
initially owns one). In this framework, in the domain of linear preferences,
the Top Trading Cycle (TTC) algorithm is the only procedure satisfying
Pareto-optimality, individual rationality and strategy-proofness. Under the
restriction of single-peaked preferences, Crawler enjoys the same properties.
These two centralized procedures might however involve long trading cycles. In
this paper we focus instead on procedures involving the shortest cycles:
bilateral swap-deals. In such swap dynamics, the agents perform pairwise
mutually improving deals until reaching a swap-stable allocation (no improving
swap-deal is possible). We prove that in the single-peaked domain every
swap-stable allocation is Pareto-optimal, showing the efficiency of the swap
dynamics. In fact, this domain turns out to be maximal when it comes to
guaranteeing this property. Besides, both the outcome of TTC and Crawler can
always be reached by sequences of swaps. However, some Pareto-optimal
allocations are not reachable through improving swap-deals. We further analyze
the outcome of swap dynamics through social welfare notions, in our context the
average or minimum rank of the resources obtained by agents in the final
allocation. We start by providing a worst-case analysis of these procedures.
Finally, we present an extensive experimental study in which different versions
of swap dynamics are compared to other existing allocation procedures. We show
that they exhibit good results on average in this domain, under different
cultures for generating synthetic data.

powerful tools to extract task-relevant information from a wide variety of EM
measurements, ranging from optics to the microwave domain. However, given the
ability to actively illuminate a particular scene with a programmable EM
wavefront, it is often not clear what wavefronts optimally encode information
for the task at hand (e.g., object detection, classification). Here, we show
that by integrating a physical model of scene illumination and detection into a
ML pipeline, we can jointly learn optimal sampling and measurement processing
strategies for a given task. We consider in simulation the example of
classifying objects using microwave radiation produced by dynamic metasurfaces.
By integrating an analytical forward model describing the metamaterial elements
as coupled dipoles into the ML pipeline, we jointly train analog model weights
with digital neural network weights. The learned non-intuitive illumination
settings yield a higher classification accuracy using fewer measurements. On
the practical level, these results are highly relevant to emerging
context-aware systems such as autonomous vehicles, touchless human-interactive
devices or within smart health care, where strict time constraints place severe
limits on measurement strategies. On the conceptual level, our work serves as a
bridge between wavefront shaping and tunable metasurface design on the physical

confidence of its result. When the domain of the problem is large (e.g.
traversal of a high-dimensional space), a perfect solution cannot be obtained,
so approximations must be made. These approximations often lead to a reported
quantity of interest (QOI) which varies between runs, decreasing the confidence
of any single run. When the algorithm further computes this final QOI based on
uncertain or noisy data, the variability (or lack of confidence) of the final
QOI increases. Unbounded, these two sources of uncertainty (algorithmic
approximations and uncertainty in input data) can result in a reported
statistic that has low correlation with ground truth.
  In biological applications, this is especially applicable, as the search
space is generally approximated at least to some degree (e.g. a high percentage
of protein structures are invalid or energetically unfavorable) and the
explicit conversion from continuous to discrete space for protein
representation implies some uncertainty in the input data. This research
applies uncertainty quantification techniques to the difficult protein-protein
docking problem, first showing the variability that exists in existing
software, and then providing a method for computing probabilistic certificates
in the form of Chernoff-like bounds. Finally, this paper leverages these
probabilistic certificates to accurately bound the uncertainty in docking from
two docking algorithms, providing a QOI that is both robust and statistically
meaningful.

four hypothetical universes where every black hole born in the collapse of a

black holes from clusters have components formed from previous mergers,
accounting for more than 20% of the mergers from globular clusters detectable

component with a mass $\gtrsim 55M_{\odot}$, placing them clearly in the mass
""gap"" region where black holes cannot form from isolated collapsing stars due
to the pulsational-pair instability mechanism. On the other hand, if black
holes are born spinning, then the contribution from these second-generation

  Approach for Computer-Aided Diagnosis Systems",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) is a popular technique
used to increase the interpretability and explainability of black box Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms. LIME typically generates an explanation for a single
prediction by any ML model by learning a simpler interpretable model (e.g.
linear classifier) around the prediction through generating simulated data
around the instance by random perturbation, and obtaining feature importance
through applying some form of feature selection. While LIME and similar local
algorithms have gained popularity due to their simplicity, the random
perturbation and feature selection methods result in ""instability"" in the
generated explanations, where for the same prediction, different explanations
can be generated. This is a critical issue that can prevent deployment of LIME
in a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system, where stability is of utmost
importance to earn the trust of medical professionals. In this paper, we
propose a deterministic version of LIME. Instead of random perturbation, we
utilize agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (HC) to group the training data
together and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) to select the relevant cluster of the
new instance that is being explained. After finding the relevant cluster, a
linear model is trained over the selected cluster to generate the explanations.
Experimental results on three different medical datasets show the superiority
for Deterministic Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (DLIME),
where we quantitatively determine the stability of DLIME compared to LIME
utilizing the Jaccard similarity among multiple generated explanations.

stringent end-to-end service requirements across multiple network segments,
from access to transport. These requirements are shaping technical evolution in
each of these segments. In particular, the transport segment is currently
evolving in the direction of the so-called elastic optical networks (EONs), a
new generation of optical networks supporting a flexible optical-spectrum grid
and novel elastic transponder capabilities. In this paper, we focus on the
reliability of 5G transport-network slices in EON. Specifically, we consider
the problem of slicing 5G transport networks, i.e., establishing virtual
networks on 5G transport, while providing dedicated protection. As dedicated
protection requires large amount of backup resources, our proposed solution
incorporates two techniques to reduce backup resources: (i) bandwidth
squeezing, i.e., providing a reduced protection bandwidth with respect to the
original request; and (ii) survivable multi-path provisioning. We leverage the
capability of EONs to fine tune spectrum allocation and adapt modulation format
and Forward Error Correction (FEC) for allocating rightsize spectrum resources
to network slices. Our numerical evaluation over realistic case-study network
topologies quantifies the spectrum savings achieved by employing EON over
traditional fixed-grid optical networks, and provides new insights on the
impact of bandwidth squeezing and multi-path provisioning on spectrum
utilization.

trade-offs for making this choice.
  Most related work chooses the viable nexthops by applying the ""Downward
Criterion"", i.e., only adding nexthops that lead closer to the destination; or
more generally by creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for each destination.
We show that a DAG's nexthop options are necessarily limited, and that, by
using certain links in both directions (per destination), we can add further
nexthops while still avoiding loops. Our solution LFID (Loop-Free
Inport-Dependent) routing, though having a slightly higher time complexity,
leads to both a higher number of and shorter potential paths than related work.
LFID thus protects against a higher percentage of single and multiple failures

performance and reduce deployment costs of traditional, infrastructure-based
content delivery networks. This is done by employing peer-to-peer data
transfers to supplement the resources of the network infrastructure. However,
these hybrid systems are vulnerable to accounting attacks in which the peers,
or caches, collude with clients in order to report that content was transferred
when it was not. This is a particular issue in systems that incentivize cache
participation, because malicious caches may collect rewards from the content
publishers operating the CDN without doing any useful work.
  In this paper, we introduce CAPnet, the first technique that lets untrusted
caches join a peer-assisted CDN while providing a bound on the effectiveness of
accounting attacks. At its heart is a lightweight cache accountability puzzle
that clients must solve before caches are given credit. This puzzle requires
colocating the data a client has requested, so its solution confirms that the
content (or at least an amount of data within a pre-configured bound) has
actually been retrieved. We analyze the security and overhead of our scheme in
realistic scenarios. The results show that a modest client machine using a
single core can solve puzzles at a rate sufficient to simultaneously watch
dozens of 1080p videos. The technique is designed to be even more scalable on
the server side. In our experiments, one core of a single low-end machine is
able to generate puzzles for 4.26 Tbps of bandwidth - enabling 870,000 clients
to concurrently view the same 1080p video. This demonstrates that our scheme
can ensure cache accountability without degrading system productivity.

shallow methods to deep neural networks. Most deep CTR models follow an
Embedding\&MLP paradigm, that is, first mapping discrete id features, e.g. user
visited items, into low dimensional vectors with an embedding module, then
learn a multi-layer perception (MLP) to fit the target. In this way, embedding
module performs as the representative learning and plays a key role in the
model performance. However, in many real-world applications, deep CTR model
often suffers from poor generalization performance, which is mostly due to the
learning of embedding parameters. In this paper, we model user behavior using
an interest delay model, study carefully the embedding mechanism, and obtain
two important results: (i) We theoretically prove that small aggregation radius
of embedding vectors of items which belongs to a same user interest domain will
result in good generalization performance of deep CTR model. (ii) Following our
theoretical analysis, we design a new embedding structure named res-embedding.
In res-embedding module, embedding vector of each item is the sum of two
components: (i) a central embedding vector calculated from an item-based
interest graph (ii) a residual embedding vector with its scale to be relatively
small. Empirical evaluation on several public datasets demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed res-embedding structure, which brings significant
improvement on the model performance.

with multiple surrounding vehicles. The correlations between road users vary
over time, the degree of which, in theory, could be infinitely large, thus
posing a great challenge in modeling and predicting the driving environment. In
this paper, we propose a method to model multi-vehicle interactions using a
stochastic vector field model and apply non-parametric Bayesian learning to
extract the underlying motion patterns from a large quantity of naturalistic
traffic data. We then use this model to reproduce the high-dimensional driving
scenarios in a finitely tractable form. We use a Gaussian process to model
multi-vehicle motion, and a Dirichlet process to assign each observation to a
specific scenario. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on
highway and intersection datasets from the NGSIM project, in which complex
multi-vehicle interactions are prevalent. The results show that the proposed
method can capture motion patterns from both settings, without imposing heroic
prior, and hence demonstrate the potential application for a wide array of
traffic situations. The proposed modeling method could enable simulation
platforms and other testing methods designed for autonomous vehicle evaluation,
to easily model and generate traffic scenarios emulating large scale driving
data.

multilayer, have recently been studied as a platform to observe optical spin
Hall effect. However, the large optical spin Hall effect in the horizontal
hyperbolic metamaterials accompanies extremely low transmission, which
obstructs its practical applications. Reducing the sample thickness to augment
the transmission causes diminishment of the shift. In this letter, we
demonstrate that a vertical hyperbolic metamaterial can enhance the shift by
several orders of magnitude in comparison to the shift of its horizontal
counterpart. Under the same conditions of material combinations and total
thickness, the shift enhancement, which is incident angle-dependent, can be
higher than 800-fold when the incident angle is 5 degree, and 5000-fold when
the incident angle is 1 degree. As a proof of concept, we fabricate a
large-scale gold nano-grating by nanoimprint lithography and measure the
helicity-dependent shift by Stokes polarimetry setup, which agrees well with
the simulated result. The gigantic optical spin Hall effect in a vertical
hyperbolic metamaterial will enable helicity-dependent control of optical
devices including filters, sensors, switches and beam splitters.

change in its orbital period due to dynamical friction as the binary moves
through a wind of DM particles. We compute such a perturbative effect on the
binary evolution considering that DM is constituted of degenerate gas of free
fermions. The analysis point out that the secular change of the orbital period
is more sensitive, and likely measurable, to degenerate fermions with masses
$\gtrsim50$ eV, depending slightly, but still being distinguishable, on the
binary star configuration (e.g. NS-NS, NS-WD and WD-WD). Interestingly, we find
that NS-NS binary systems with large orbital periods, $P_{b}\gtrsim100$ days,
experience larger orbital period decays. We also show that this effect is
clearly increased, under the former conditions, in binaries orbiting small DM
halos, which correspond to extragalactic pulsars. This situation represents the
best astrophysical scenario to test such effects of light fermionic DM. We use
some available measurements of the orbital period time-derivative for
long-period binaries in the Milky-Way to quantify more realistically this
effect. For instance, measurements of the J1713+0747 pulsar set an upper bound
on the fermion mass of $m_{f}\lesssim 1$ keV. This bound can be considerably
improved by using pulsar timing observations of extragalactic pulsars. Under
this perspective, high precision of timing pulsar observations will reveal
whether DM dynamical friction effect may be tested with the upcoming generation

hurdles for non-expert users, who typically lack language expertise and are

an alternative mechanism: users provide examples of their intended query output
and the QBE system needs to infer the intended query. However, these approaches
focus on the structural similarity of the examples and ignore the richer
context present in the data. As a result, they typically produce queries that
are too general, and fail to capture the user's intent effectively. In this
paper, we present SQuID, a system that performs semantic similarity-aware query
intent discovery. Our work makes the following contributions: (1) We design an
end-to-end system that automatically formulates select-project-join queries in
an open-world setting, with optional group-by aggregation and intersection
operators; a much larger class than prior QBE techniques. (2) We express the
problem of query intent discovery using a probabilistic abduction model, that
infers a query as the most likely explanation of the provided examples. (3) We
introduce the notion of an abduction-ready database, which precomputes semantic
properties and related statistics, allowing SQuID to achieve real-time
performance. (4) We present an extensive empirical evaluation on three

decades. HIVE-COTE (Hierarchical Vote Collective of Transformation-based
Ensembles) is the current state of the art in terms of classification accuracy.
HIVE-COTE recognizes that time series data are a specific data type for which
the traditional attribute-value representation, used predominantly in machine
learning, fails to provide a relevant representation. HIVE-COTE combines
multiple types of classifiers: each extracting information about a specific
aspect of a time series, be it in the time domain, frequency domain or
summarization of intervals within the series. However, HIVE-COTE (and its
predecessor, FLAT-COTE) is often infeasible to run on even modest amounts of
data. For instance, training HIVE-COTE on a dataset with only 1,500 time series
can require 8 days of CPU time. It has polynomial runtime with respect to the
training set size, so this problem compounds as data quantity increases. We
propose a novel TSC algorithm, TS-CHIEF (Time Series Combination of
Heterogeneous and Integrated Embedding Forest), which rivals HIVE-COTE in
accuracy but requires only a fraction of the runtime. TS-CHIEF constructs an
ensemble classifier that integrates the most effective embeddings of time
series that research has developed in the last decade. It uses tree-structured
classifiers to do so efficiently. We assess TS-CHIEF on 85 datasets of the
University of California Riverside (UCR) archive, where it achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with scalability and efficiency. We demonstrate that
TS-CHIEF can be trained on 130k time series in 2 days, a data quantity that is
beyond the reach of any TSC algorithm with comparable accuracy.

model composed of a nearly isentropic convective core and a thin radiative
envelope. To represent the tidal responses of rotating planets, we employ
series expansions in terms of spherical harmonic functions $Y_l^m$ with
different $l$s for a given $m$. For low forcing frequency, there occurs
frequency resonance between the forcing and the $g$- and $r$-modes in the
envelope and inertial modes in the core. We find that the resonance enhances
the tidal torque, and that the resonance with the $g$- and $r$-modes produces
broad peaks and that with the inertial modes very sharp peaks, depending on the
magnitude of the non-adiabatic effects associated with the oscillation modes.
We also find that the behavior of the tidal torque as a function of the forcing
frequency (or period) is different between prograde and retrograde forcing,
particularly for long forcing periods because the $r$-modes, which have long
periods, exist only on the retrograde side.

local antimagic total. We showed that there exists close relationship between
$\chi_{la}(G \vee K_1)$ and $\chi_{lat}(G)$. A sufficient condition is also
given for the corresponding local super antimagic total labeling. Sharp bounds
of $\chi_{lat}(G)$ and close relationships between $\chi_{lat}(G)$ and
$\chi_{la}(G \vee K_1)$ are found. Bounds of $\chi_{lat}(G-e)$ in terms of
$\chi_{lat}(G)$ for a graph $G$ with an edge $e$ deleted are also obtained.
These relationships are used to determine the exact values of $\chi_{lat}$ for

maximum likelihood, PGAs generalize the idea of reversible generative models to
unrestricted neural network architectures and arbitrary number of latent

convolutional neural networks (CNN) to be deployed in resource-constrained

according to the ""importance"" of filters. Despite their success, we notice they
suffer from at least two of the following problems: 1) The redundancy among
filters is not considered because the importance is evaluated independently. 2)
Cross-layer filter comparison is unachievable since the importance is defined
locally within each layer. Consequently, we must manually specify layer-wise
pruning ratios. 3) They are prone to generate sub-optimal solutions because
they neglect the inequality between reducing parameters and reducing
computational cost. Reducing the same number of parameters in different
positions in the network may reduce different computational cost. To address
the above problems, we develop a novel algorithm named as COP
(correlation-based pruning), which can detect the redundant filters
efficiently. We enable the cross-layer filter comparison through global
normalization. We add parameter-quantity and computational-cost regularization
terms to the importance, which enables the users to customize the compression
according to their preference (smaller or faster). Extensive experiments have
shown COP outperforms the others significantly. The code is released at

Previous benchmark suites such as Rodinia and SHOC have served the research
community well, but were developed years ago when hardware was more limited,
software supported fewer features, and production hardware-accelerated
workloads were scarce. Since that time, GPU compute density and memory capacity
has grown exponentially, programmability features such as unified memory,
demand paging, and HyperQ have matured, and new workloads such as deep neural
networks (DNNs), graph analytics, and crypto-currencies have emerged in
production environments, stressing the hardware and software in ways that
previous benchmarks did not anticipate. Drawing inspiration from Rodinia and
SHOC, Altis is a benchmark suite designed for modern GPU architectures and
modern GPU runtimes, representing a diverse set of application domains. By
adopting and extending applications from Rodinia and SHOC, adding new
applications, and focusing on CUDA platforms, Altis better represents modern
GPGPU workloads to enable support GPGPU research in both architecture and
system software.

analyzing pion electroproduction data, and to neutrino-induced reactions using

relationship between the two, however, has yet to be addressed. For this
purpose, we perform an observational analysis using images acquired with the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 171{\AA} passband to follow the evolution of
coronal plumes, the observations taken by the Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph (IRIS) slit-jaw 1330{\AA} to study the network jets, and the
line-of-sight magnetograms taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
to overview the the photospheric magnetic features in the regions. Four regions
in the network lanes are identified, and labeled ``R1--R4''. We find that
coronal plumes are clearly seen only in ``R1''&''R2'' but not in ``R3''&``R4'',
even though network jets abound in all these regions. Furthermore, while
magnetic features in all these regions are dominated by positive polarity, they
are more compact (suggesting stronger convergence) in ``R1''&``R2'' than that
in ``R3''&``R4''. We develop an automated method to identify and track the
network jets in the regions. We find that the network jets rooted in
``R1''&``R2'' are higher and faster than that in ``R3''&``R4'',indicating that
network regions producing stronger coronal plumes also tend to produce more
dynamic network jets. We suggest that the stronger convergence in ``R1''&``R2''
might provide a condition for faster shocks and/or more small-scale magnetic
reconnection events that power more dynamic network jets and coronal plumes.

Partial QE (PQE). In PQE, only a small part of the formula is taken out of the
scope of quantifiers. The appeal of PQE is that many verification problems,
e.g. equivalence checking and model checking, reduce to PQE and the latter is
much easier than complete QE. Earlier, we introduced a PQE algorithm based on
the machinery of D-sequents. A D-sequent is a record stating that a clause is
redundant in a quantified CNF formula in a specified subspace. To make this
algorithm efficient, it is important to reuse learned D-sequents. However,
reusing D-sequents is not as easy as conflict clauses in SAT-solvers because
redundancy is a structural rather than a semantic property. Earlier, we
modified the definition of D-sequents to enable their safe reusing. In this
paper, we present a PQE algorithm based on new D-sequents. It is different from
its predecessor in two aspects. First, the new algorithm can learn and reuse
D-sequents. Second, it proves clauses redundant one by one and thus backtracks
as soon as the current target clause is proved redundant in the current
subspace. This makes the new PQE algorithm similar to a SAT-solver that
backtracks as soon as just one clause is falsified. We show experimentally that
the new PQE algorithm outperforms its predecessor.

captured by the three-dimensional winding number of the propagator that
describes time-evolution within a cycle. This index captures the homotopy class
of such a unitary map. In this paper, we provide an interpretation of this
winding number in terms of local data associated to the the eigenvalue
crossings of such a map over a three dimensional manifold, based on an idea
from Nathan and Rudner, New Journal of Physics, 17(12) 125014, 2015. We show
that, up to homotopy, the crossings are a finite set of points and non
degenerate. Each crossing carries a local Chern number, and the sum of these
local indices coincides with the winding number. We then extend this result to
fully degenerate crossings and extended submanifolds to connect with models
from the physics literature. We finally classify up to homotopy the Floquet
unitary maps, defined on manifolds with boundary, using the previous local
indices. The results rely on a filtration of the special unitary group as well
as the local data of the basic gerbe over it.

Sunyaev Zeldovich (SZ) power spectrum and cluster counts analyses, highlighting
subtle dependencies on the total neutrino mass and data combination. In
particular, we find that using the transfer functions for Cold Dark Matter
(CDM) + baryons in the computation of the halo mass function, instead of the
transfer functions including neutrino perturbations, as prescribed in recent
work, yields a $\approx$ 0.25\% downward shift of the $\sigma_8$ constraint
from tSZ power spectrum data, with a fiducial neutrino mass $\Sigma m_\nu=0.06$
eV. In $\Lambda$CDM, with an X-ray mass bias corresponding to the expected
hydrostatic mass bias, i.e., $(1-b)\simeq0.8$, our constraints from Planck SZ
data are consistent with the latest results from SPT, DES-Y1 and
KiDS+VIKING-450. In $\nu\Lambda$CDM, our joint analyses of Planck SZ with
Planck 2015 primary CMB yield a small improvement on the total neutrino mass
bound compared to the Planck 2015 primary CMB constraint, as well as
$(1-b)=0.64\pm0.04$~(68\%~CL). For forecasts, we find that competitive neutrino
mass measurements using cosmic variance limited SZ power spectrum require
masking the heaviest clusters and probing the small-scale SZ power spectrum up
to $\ell_\mathrm{max}\approx10^4$. Although this is challenging, we find that
SZ power spectrum can realistically be used to tightly constrain intra-cluster
medium properties: we forecast a 2\% determination of the X-ray mass bias by

filtergraphs when employed in magnetographs. Specially that they can be tuned
by only applying electric fields. However, anisotropic crystalline etalons can
also introduce undesired birefringent effects that corrupt the polarization of
the incoming light. In particular, uniaxial Fabry-P\'erots, such as LiNbO3
etalons, are birefringent when illuminated with an oblique beam. The farther
the incidence from the normal, the larger the induced retardance between the
two orthogonal polarization states. The application of high-voltages, as well
as fabrication defects, can also change the direction of the optical axis of
the crystal, introducing birefringence even at normal illumination. Here we
obtain analytical expressions for the induced retardance and for the Mueller
matrix of uniaxial etalons located in both collimated and telecentric
configurations. We also evaluate the polarimetric behavior of Z-cut crystalline
etalons with the incident angle, with the orientation of the optical axis, and
with the f-number of the incident beam for the telecentric case. We study
artificial signals produced in the output Stokes vector in the two
configurations. Last, we discuss the polarimetric dependence of the imaging
response of the etalon for both collimated and telecentric setups.

As a result, the WebAssembly code may become the only available object to be

it more difficult to detect vulnerabilities from those smart contracts. In this

predictions on networks containing cycles as do most real complex networks.
Here we show that the MPA does not perform its calculations on some ill-defined
tree-like approximation of the network, as its formulation leads to believe,
but rather considers a random network ensemble in which the original network is
cloned and shuffled an infinite number of times. We conclude that the fact that
the MPA is exact on trees does not imply that it is nearly exact on tree-like

components are linearly independent; however, when some data points are
missing, there is going to be leakage from one component to another, which is
referred to as the ""leakage in integral transforms"" in this work. A special
case of this kind of leakage is the EB-leakage in detection of the cosmological

them to the case of EB-leakage and detection of the CGWB. In the upcoming
decade, most likely, new cosmic microwave background (CMB) data are from
ground/balloon experiments, so they provide only partial sky coverage. Even in
a fullsky mission, due to the Galactic foreground, part of the sky is still
unusable. Within this context, the EB-leakage becomes inevitable. I show how to

scale of 0.05 Mpc$^{-1}$), $1\%$ sky coverage ($f_{sky}=1\%$) is enough for a
$5\sigma$-detection of $r\ge 10^{-2}$, but is barely enough for $r=10^{-3}$. If
the target is to detect $r\sim 10^{-4}$ or $10^{-5}$, then $f_{sky}\ge 10\%$ is
strongly recommended to enable a $5\sigma$-detection and to reserve some room
for other errors.

to discover complex Active Flow Control (AFC) strategies [Rabault, J., Kuchta,
M., Jensen, A., Reglade, U., & Cerardi, N. (2019): ""Artificial neural networks
trained through deep reinforcement learning discover control strategies for
active flow control"", Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 865, 281-302]. However, while
promising results were obtained on a simple 2D benchmark flow at a moderate
Reynolds number, considerable speedups will be required to investigate more
challenging flow configurations. In the case of DRL trained with Computational
Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data, it was found that the CFD part, rather than training
the Artificial Neural Network, was the limiting factor for speed of execution.
Therefore, speedups should be obtained through a combination of two approaches.
The first one, which is well documented in the literature, is to parallelize
the numerical simulation itself. The second one is to adapt the DRL algorithm
for parallelization. Here, a simple strategy is to use several independent
simulations running in parallel to collect experiences faster. In the present
work, we discuss this solution for parallelization. We illustrate that perfect
speedups can be obtained up to the batch size of the DRL agent, and slightly
suboptimal scaling still takes place for an even larger number of simulations.
This is, therefore, an important step towards enabling the study of more
sophisticated Fluid Mechanics problems through DRL.

the semantic level, as we incorporate an additional object-level classification

different configurations of charged particles in stochastic motion are
calculated by numerically solving the associated equations of motion. The
method is suitable for obtaining accurate descriptions of diffusion in both
intermediate and long time regimes. It is also appropriate for studying a
variety of astrophysical configurations since it may incorporate microscopic
physics that analytical methods cannot cope with. The results show that, in the
intermediary time regime, the diffusion coefficient has an irregular behavior,
which can be described in terms of the complex interplay appearing between the

such an approach may serve at differential diagnosis of different astrophysical

properties. One factor which governs the behaviour of a material, under a given
condition, is the microstructure. Despite the absence of any phase
transformation, a change in the microstructure would significantly alter the
properties. Therefore, a substantial understanding on the stability of the
microstructure is vital to avert any unexpected catastrophic change in the
material properties. In the present work, one such numerical approach called
phase-field modelling in employed to analyse the stability of two- and
three-dimensional finite structures, which dictate the curvature-driven
evolution of the microstructure. A characteristic feature of this numerical
approach is the introduction of a scalar variable, called the phase field, in
addition to the other thermodynamic variables. While the inclusion of the phase
field obviates the need for the interface tracking, which is a strenuous aspect
of the other conventional techniques, it replaces the sharp interface with a
finite diffuse region. Therefore, before adopting and extending the phase-field
technique, it is shown that the model recovers the governing law, i.e,
Gibbs-Thomson relation, despite the introduction of the diffuse interface.
Subsequently, the numerical treatment is employed to investigate the
volume-diffusion governed curvature-induced transformation.

accompanied by a transfer of electrons originally occupying the graphene's spin

dispersion of one of which is distorted near the Fermi energy due to spin

close to the N$\'e$el temperature of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ suggests the onset of

  Cognitive Radio Networks with Random Channel States","14 pages, 3 figures, under review in IEEE Transactions on Mobile
  Computing",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the multichannel rendezvous problem in cognitive
radio networks (CRNs) where the probability that two users hopping on the same
channel have a successful rendezvous is a function of channel states. The
channel states are modeled by stochastic processes with joint distributions
known to users. However, the exact state of a channel at any time is not
observable. We first consider two channel models: (i) the fast time-varying
channel model (where the channel states are assumed to be independent and
identically distributed in each time slot), and (ii) the slow time-varying
channel model (where the channel states remain unchanged over time). Among the
classes of the blind rendezvous policies that randomly hop on channels
according to certain channel selection probabilities, we show the optimal
channel selection policy that minimizes the expected time-to-rendezvous (ETTR)
is the single selection policy that hops on the ``best'' channel all the time
in the fast time-varying channel model. However, for the slow time-varying
channel model, it is much more difficult to find the optimal channel selection
policy. By using the majorization ordering, we derive a lower bound and an
upper bound for the ETTR under the assumption that the channel states are
exchangeable random variables. Bases on these bounds, we then prove various
approximation solutions. We then extend our results to general channel models
where the joint distribution of the channel states is only assumed to be
stationary in time.

efficacy are important relative performance measures of signal detection
techniques. These measures allow comparing two detectors in terms of the
relative sample sizes they require to achieve the same prescribed level of
false alarm and detection probabilities. While the finite-sample-size measure
RE is useful to analyze the small sample behavior of detectors, in practice it
is difficult to compute. In the limit as the signal strength approaches zero at
an appropriate rate, the RE converges to an asymptotic limit only for very
large sample sizes. This limiting ratio of the number of samples is the ARE,
which lends analytical tractability, but does not provide insights into the
finite sample behavior of detectors which is important for practical
applications. This led researchers to study the convergence of RE to ARE, and
has been well-reported for the problem of constant signal detection in
additive, independent, and identically distributed noise. When the signal to be
detected is random ({\ie}, unknown), such a convergence analysis is lacking in
the literature and is the focus of this paper. A relationship between RE and
ARE for random signal detection is established. We use the higher-order terms
in the Taylor series expansion of the mean of the test statistic under the
alternative hypothesis to derive this formula. We present preliminary remarks
on the convergence of RE to ARE for random signals in comparison to that for
constant signal detection.

to the non-convexity of the problem and the feasible domain, the problem is
firstly transformed into a tractable suboptimal form. Then a secure hybrid

that the amplitude values of the detected structures are approximately twice as
large as the values for the TEC derived in the International Reference

tendency to continue moving in the same direction). For positive persistence
the MSD behaves as expected: it increases with the persistence and decreases
with the density. However, for strong anti-persistence we find two different
regimes, in which the dependence of the MSD on the density is non-monotonic.
For very strong anti-persistence there is an optimal density at which the MSD
reaches a maximum. In an intermediate regime, the MSD as a function of the
density exhibits both a minimum and a maximum, a phenomenon which has not been
observed before. We derive a mean-field theory which qualitatively explains
this behaviour.

the critical density it increases with their propensity to move forward. If the
correlations are neglected the critical density is exactly $1/2$. We also
derive a low-density approximation for the same time correlations between
different sites. We perform simulations on a one-dimensional system with
one-step memory and find good agreement between our analytical derivation and
the numerical results. We also consider the previously unexplored special case
of totally anti-persistent particles. Generally, the correlation length
converges to a finite value. However in the special case of totally
anti-persistent particles and density $1/2$, the correlation length diverges
with time. Furthermore, connecting a system of totally anti-persistent
particles to external particle reservoirs creates a new phenomenon: In almost
all systems, regardless of the precise details of the microscopic dynamics,
when a system is connected to a reservoir, the mean density of particle at the
edge is the same as the reservoir following the zeroth law of thermodynamics.
In a totally anti-persistent system, however, the density at the edge is always
higher than in the reservoir. We find a qualitative description of this
phenomenon which agrees reasonably well with the numerics.

critically compared and this confrontation leads to several important
conclusions. The theoretically predicted trends nowadays reproduce the
experimental findings quite well for series of molecules with a single
well-defined control parameter, such as the length of the molecules. The
quantitative agreement between theory and experiment usually is less
convincing, however. Many reasons for quantitative discrepancies can be
identified, from which one may decide that qualitative agreement is the best

systems are required that are sufficiently well-defined by experiment to allow
quantitative testing of the approximation schemes underlying the theoretical
modeling. Several key experiments can be identified suggesting that the present

experimental observations and their current models are also discussed here,
leading to several suggestions for extensions of the models towards including

on agricultural ontologies, however, reveals that most of the studies, which

This is undesired because without well-structured evaluation processes, it is
difficult to consider the value of ontologies to research and practice.
Moreover, it is difficult to rely on such ontologies and share them on the
Semantic Web or between semantic aware applications. With the growing number of
ontology-based agricultural systems and the increasing popularity of the

are put forward to guide future efforts of ontology development. Our work

and evolution of cosmic structure. Intrinsic scatters and correlations between
X-ray properties are determined from merger history, baryonic processes, and
dynamical state.
  Aims. We look for an unbiased measurement of the scatter covariance matrix
between the three main X-ray observable quantities attainable in large X-ray
surveys -- temperature, luminosity, and gas mass. This also gives us the
cluster property with the lowest conditional intrinsic scatter at fixed mass.
  Methods. Intrinsic scatters and correlations can be measured under the
assumption that the observable properties of the intra-cluster medium hosted in
clusters are log-normally distributed around power-law scaling relations. The
proposed method is self-consistent, based on minimal assumptions, and requires
neither the external calibration by weak lensing, dynamical, or hydrostatic
masses nor the knowledge of the mass completeness.
  Results. We analyzed the 100 brightest clusters detected in the XXL Survey
and their X-ray properties measured within a fixed radius of 300 kpc. The gas
mass is the less scattered proxy (~8%). The temperature (~20%) is intrinsically
less scattered than the luminosity (~30%) but it is measured with a larger
observational uncertainty. We found some evidence that gas mass, temperature
and luminosity are positively correlated. Time-evolutions are in agreement with
the self-similar scenario, but the luminosity-temperature and the gas
mass-temperature relations are steeper.
  Conclusions. Positive correlations between X-ray properties can be determined
by the dynamical state and the merger history of the halos. The slopes of the
scaling relations are affected by radiative processes.

statistics. It has been extended to multi-dimensional cases both in location
and in regression via notions of data depth.
  Regression depth (RD) and projection regression depth (PRD) represent the two
most promising notions in regression. Carrizosa depth $D_C$ is another depth
notion in regression.Depth induced regression medians (maximum depth
estimators) serve as robust alternatives to the classical least squares
estimator.
  The uniqueness of regression medians is indispensable in the discussion of
their properties and the asymptotics (consistency and limiting distribution) of
sample regression medians. Are the regression medians induced from RD, PRD, and
$D_C$ unique? Answering this question is the main goal of this article. It is
found that only the regression median induced from PRD possesses the desired
uniqueness property. The conventional remedy measure for non-uniqueness, taking
average of all medians, might yield an estimator that no longer possesses the
maximum depth in both RD and $D_C$ cases.
  These and other findings indicate that the PRD and its induced median are
highly favorable among their leading competitors.

commonly need to be downscaled to a finer grid. One challenge of this
requirement is the modeling of sub-grid variability and the spatial and
temporal dependence at the finer scale. Here, a post-processing procedure is
proposed for temperature projections that addresses this challenge. The
procedure employs statistical bias correction and stochastic downscaling in two
steps. In a first step, errors that are related to spatial and temporal
features of the first two moments of the temperature distribution at model
scale are identified and corrected. Secondly, residual space-time dependence at
the finer scale is analyzed using a statistical model, from which realizations
are generated and then combined with appropriate climate change signal to form
the downscaled projection fields. Using a high-resolution observational gridded
data product, the proposed approach is applied in a case study where
projections of two regional climate models from the EURO-CORDEX ensemble are
bias-corrected and downscaled to a 1x1 km grid in the Trondelag area of Norway.
A cross-validation study shows that the proposed procedure generates results
that better reflect the marginal distributional properties of the data product
and have better consistency in space and time than empirical quantile mapping.

  The perturbations are represented as independent, bounded, zero-mean random

independent, while the second one does not. For the latter, we construct a
Martingale that mirrors the sequential order of computations.
  Numerical experiments confirm that our bounds are more informative, often by
several orders of magnitude, than traditional deterministic bounds -- even for
small vector dimensions~$n$ and very stringent success probabilities. In

one of the deterministic minimizers, thereby providing a precursor for

preferential flow regimes; the first is caused by the viscous fingering and the
second is due to the permeability contrasts between the fractures and rock
matrix. We study the transition from a regime where the flow is dominated by
the viscous instabilities, to a regime where the heterogeneities induced by the
fractures define the flow paths. We find that fractures greatly affect the
viscous fingering, even for small permeability differences between the rock
matrix and the fractures. The interaction between the viscosity contrast and
permeability contrast causes channeling of the less viscous fluid through the
fractures and back to the rock. This channeling stabilizes the displacement
front in the rock matrix, and the viscous fingering ceases for the higher
permeability contrast. Several different fracture geometries are considered,
and we observe a complex interplay between the geometries and unstable flow.
While we find that the most important dimensionless number determining the
effect of the fracture network is a weighted ratio of the permeability of the
fractures and the permeability of the rock matrix, the exact point for the
cross-over regime is highly dependent on the geometry of the fracture network.

fundamental laws in physics. While the general security proof has been
established recently in an entanglement-based QSS protocol, the tolerable
channel loss is unfortunately rather small. Here we propose a continuous
variable QSS protocol using conventional laser sources and homodyne detectors.
In this protocol, a Gaussian-modulated coherent state (GMCS) prepared by one
player passes through the secure stations of the other players sequentially,
and each of the other players injects a locally prepared, independent GMCS into
the circulating optical mode. Finally, the dealer measures both the amplitude
and phase quadratures of the receiving optical mode using double homodyne
detectors. Collectively, the players can use their encoded random numbers to
estimate the measurement results of the dealer and further generate a shared
key. Unlike the existing single photon based sequential QSS protocol, our
scheme is intrinsically immune to Trojan horse attacks. Furthermore, the
additional loss introduced by each player's system can be extremely small,
which makes the protocol scalable to a large number of players. We prove the
unconditional security of the proposed protocol against both eavesdroppers and
dishonest players in the presence of high channel loss, and discuss various

nature and deriving their orbital elements to investigate the impact of their
orbits on the evolution of these systems. This research is embedded into a
wider endeavour to study binary evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars.
Method: The high amplitude pulsations were cleaned from the radial-velocity
data to better constrain the orbital motion. We used Gaia DR2 parallaxes in
combination with the SEDs to compute their luminosities which were complemented
with the ones computed using a period-luminosity-colour relation. The ratio of
the circumstellar infrared flux to the photospheric flux obtained from the SEDs
was used to estimate the orbital inclination of each system. Results: DF Cyg
and RV Tau are binaries with spectroscopic orbital periods of 784$\pm$16 days
and 1198$\pm$17 days, respectively. These orbital periods are found to be
similar to the long-term periodic variability in the photometric time series,
indicating that binarity indeed explains the long-term photometric variability.
Both systems are surrounded by a circumbinary disc which is grazed by our
line-of-sight. As a result, the stellar photometric flux is extinct
periodically with the orbital period. Our derived orbital inclinations enabled
us to obtain accurate companion masses for DF Cyg and RV Tau. Analysis of the
Kepler photometry of DF Cyg revealed a power spectrum with side lobes around
the fundamental pulsation frequency. This modulation corresponds to the
spectroscopic orbital period and hence to the long-term photometric period.
Finally we report on the evidence of high velocity absorption features related
to the H$_{\alpha}$ profile in both objects, indicating outflows launched from
around the companion.

we also explore the possibility of extending the fitting range down to

play a crucial role, allowing us to maintain good fit qualities and stable

linguistic representations of audio signals. Second, an adversarial training

two-stage training, including a pretraining stage using a multi-speaker dataset

fine-tuning issue occurs on the mass-dimension lepton-number-violation (LNV)
scalar coupling. Using the scotogenic approach, we investigate how a small LNV
term is arisen through a radiative correction when an $Z_2$-odd vector-like
lepton ($X$) and an $Z_2$-odd right-handed Majorana lepton ($N$) are introduced
to the type-II seesaw model. Due to the dark matter (DM) direct detection
constraints, the available DM candidate is the right-handed Majorana particle,
whose mass depends on and is close to the $m_X$ parameter. Combing the
constraints from the DM measurements, the $h\to \gamma\gamma$ decay, and the
oblique $T$-parameter, it is found that the preferred range of $v_\Delta$ is
approximately in the region of $10^{-5}-10^{-4}$ GeV; the mass difference
between the doubly and the singly charged Higgs is less than 50 GeV, and the
influence on the $h\to Z\gamma$ is not significant. Using the constrained
parameters, we analyze the decays of each Higgs triplet scalar in detail,
including the possible three-body decays when the kinematic condition is
allowed. It is found that with the exception of doubly charged Higgs, scalar
mixing effects play an important role in the Higgs triplet two-body decays when
the scalar masses are near-degenerate. In the non-degenerate mass region, the
branching ratios of the Higgs triplet decays are dominated by the three-body

configurations in restricted elections, first discovered by Lackner and
Lackner, in order to enhance the approach initiated by the two mentioned
authors. More specifically, our achievements are essentially two. First, we
define a new type of domain restriction, called enriched group-separable.
Enriched group-separable elections are a subset of group-separable elections,
which describe a special, still natural, situation that can arise in the
context of group-separability. The exact enumeration of group-separable
elections has been very recently determined by Karpov. Here we give a recursive
characterization for enriched group-separable elections, from which we are able
to find a recurrence relation and a closed formula expressing their number. Our
second achievement is a generalization of a result of Lackner and Lackner,
concerning the connection between permutation patterns and forbidden
configurations with 3 voters. Our result relates forbidden configurations with
the strong order on pairs of permutations, a notion which is still largely
undeveloped, and suggests a potential approach for the determination of upper

Until now no example has been confirmed at the higher mass range. Here we
report that planetary nebula BMP J1613-5406 is associated with Galactic star
cluster NGC 6067. Stars evolving off the main sequence of this cluster have a
mass around five solar masses. Confidence in the planetary nebula-cluster
association comes from their tightly consistent radial velocities in a
sightline with a steep velocity-distance gradient, common distances, reddening
and location of the planetary nebula within the cluster boundary. This is an
unprecedented example of a planetary nebular whose progenitor star mass is
getting close to the theoretical lower limit of core-collapse supernova
formation. It provides evidence supporting theoretical predictions that 5+
solar mass stars can form planetary nebulae. Further study should provide fresh
insights into stellar and Galactic chemical evolution.

small scales. We propose two methods which we find solve these issues. First,
we perform large scale simulations on a Voronoi lattice to mitigate the effects
of faceting. Secondly, the invariant arguments of the universal scaling
functions necessary to perform scaling collapses can be directly determined
using our recent normal form theory of the Renormalization Group. This method
has proven useful in cleanly capturing the complex behavior which occurs in
both the lower and upper critical dimensions of systems and here captures the
2D NE-RFIM behavior well. The obtained scaling collapses span over a range of a
factor of ten in the disorder and a factor of $10^4$ in avalanche cutoff. They
are consistent with a critical disorder at zero and with a lower critical

in particular their frequencies. There is an angular-degree dependence that is
believed to be caused by the non-spherical nature of the magnetic activity in
the stellar convective envelope. These changes in the mode frequencies could
modify the small separation of low-degree modes (i.e. frequency difference
between consecutive quadrupole and radial modes), which is sensitive to the
core structure and hence to the evolutionary stage of the star. Determining
global stellar parameters such as the age using mode frequencies at a given
moment of the magnetic activity cycle could lead to biased results. Our
estimations show that in general these errors are lower than other systematic
uncertainties, but in some circumstances they can be as high as 10% in age and
of a few percent in mass and radius. In addition, the frequency shifts caused
by the magnetic activity are also frequency dependent. In the solar case this
is a smooth function that will mostly be masked by the filtering of the
so-called surface effects. However the observations of other stars suggest that
there is an oscillatory component with a period close to the one corresponding
to the acoustic depth of the He II zone. This could give rise to a
misdetermination of some global stellar parameters, such as the helium
abundance. Our computations show that the uncertainties introduced by this
effect are lower than the 3% level.

the residual interactions. Moreover, the low energy bands of twisted graphene
bilayers show a rich structure of singularities in the density of states, van
Hove singularities, which can enhance further the role of interactions. We
study the effect of the long-range interactions on the band structure and the
van Hove singularities of the low energy bands of twisted graphene bilayers.
Reasonable values of the long-range electrostatic interaction lead to a band
dispersion with a significant dependence on the filling. The change of the
shape and position of the bands with electronic filling implies that the van
Hove singularities remain close to the Fermi energy for a broad range of
fillings. This result can be described as an effective pinning of the Fermi
energy at the singularity. The sensitivity of the band structure to screening

energy, and direction of detectable hadrons. In turn, this affects the
selection and kinematic distributions of subsamples of neutrino events used for
interaction or oscillation analysis. This technical note focuses on three forms
of two-body rescattering. Elastic hadron+nucleus scattering primarily changes
the direction of the hadron with very little energy transfer. Secondly, a
hadron+nucleon quasi-elastic process leads to the knockout of a single struck
nucleon, possibly with charge exchange between the two hadrons. Also, a pion
can be absorbed leading to the ejection of two nucleons. There was an error in
the code of the {\small GENIE} neutrino event generator that affects these
processes. We present examples of the change with the fixed version of the
scattering process, but also compare these specifically to turning off elastic
scattering completely, which is similar to other neutrino event generator
configurations or a potential Equick-fix to already generated samples. Three
examples are taken from current topics of interest: transverse kinematics
observables in quasielastic neutrino reactions, the pion angle with respect to
the incoming and outgoing lepton for $\Delta$ reactions with a charged pion in
the final state, and the angle between two protons in reactions with no pions
present. Elastic hadron+nucleus scattering in its unfixed form makes a large
distortion in distributions of transverse kinematic imbalances scattering, but
only mild distortion in other observables. The distortion of the other two
processes is also mild for all distributions considered. The correct form of
hadron+nucleus scattering process could play a role in describing the width and
center of the sharp peak in the inferred Fermi-motion of the struck nucleon or
be benchmarked using (e,e'p) data.

be coplanar. However, some theoretical works show that under certain conditions
a CBD can become polar, which means that its rotation vector is orthogonal with
respect to the binary orbital plane. Interestingly, very recent observations
show that polar CBDs exist in nature (e.g. HD 98800). Aims. We test the
predictions of CBD alignment around eccentric binaries based on linear theory.
In particular, we compare prograde and retrograde CBD configurations. Then,
assuming planets form in these systems, we thoroughly characterise the orbital
behaviour and stability of misaligned (P-type) particles. This is done for
massless and massive particles. Methods. The evolution of the CBD alignment for
various configurations was modelled through three-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations. For the orbital characterisation and the analysis stability, we
relied on long-term N-body integrations and structure and chaos indicators,
such as $\Delta e$ and MEGNO. Results. We confirm previous analytical
predictions on CBD alignment, but find an unexpected symmetry breaking between
prograde and retrograde configurations. Therefore, the likelihood of becoming
polar for a highly misaligned CBD is higher than previously thought. Regarding
the stability of circumbinary P-type planets (also know as Tatooines), polar
orbits are stable over a wide range of binary parameters. In particular, for
binary eccentricities below 0.4 the orbits are stable for any value of the
binary mass ratio. In the absence of gas, planets with masses below
$10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}$ have negligible effects on the binary orbit. Finally, we
suggest that mildly eccentric equal-mass binaries should be searched for polar
Tatooines.

monolayer with an anisotropic Dirac cone. We investigate the
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) interaction, between two magnetic
impurity moments in armchair-terminated B$_2$S nanoribbons in the presence of
strain and staggered sublattice potential. By using an accurate tight-binding
model, we firstly study the electronic properties of all infinite-length
armchair B$_2$S nanoribbons (ABSNRs), with different edges, in the presence of
both strain and staggered potential. The ABSNRs show different electronic and
magnetic behaviors due to different edge morphologies. The band gap energy of
ABSNRs depends strongly upon the applied staggered potential and thus one can
engineer the electronic properties of the ABSNRs via tuning the external
staggered potential. A complete and fully reversible semiconductor (or
insulator) to metal transition has been observed via tuning the external
staggered potential, which can be easily realized experimentally. A prominent
feature is the presence of a quasiflat edge mode, isolated from the bulk modes
in the ABSNRs belong to the family $M=6p$, with $M$ the width of the ABSNR and
$p$ an integer number. The position of the quasi-flatbands(QFBs) in the energy
diagram of ABSNRs can be shifted by applying the in-plane strains. At a
critical staggered potential, for nanoribbons of arbitrary width, the QFB
changes to a perfect flatband. The RKKY interaction has an oscillating
behaviour in terms of the applied staggered potentials and width of the ribbon,
such that for two magnetic adatoms randomly distributed on the surface of an
ABSNR the staggered potential can reverse the RKKY from antiferromagnetism to
ferromagnetism and vice versa. Our findings pave the way for applications in
spintronics and pseudospin electronics devices based on ABSNRs.

can be achieved e.g. by employing phase-change materials (PCMs). However, the
excitation of surface polaritons in planar structures is intrinsically limited
to p-polarization. On the contrary, waveguide modes in high-permittivity films
can couple to both p- and s-polarized light, and in thin films, their
confinement can become comparable to surface polaritons. Here we demonstrate
that the s-polarized waveguide mode in a thin Ge$_3$Sb$_2$Te$_6$ (GST) film

the SPhP mode of the silicon carbide (SiC) substrate, while even expanding the

is dominant over couplings between edge and bulk states, due to the topological

employed. As a result, the method estimates the instantaneous phase, frequency,
derivative of frequency (line-of-sight acceleration) and the total count phase
of different integration scales. This data can be further used in planetary
radio science research to analyze the planetary occultation and gravitational
fields. The method has been tested on MEX (Mars Express, ESA) and Chang'E 4

able to acheive the target convergence threshold in 6.5 seconds and do
real-time processing on NVIDIA GTX580 and 2$\times$ NVIDIA K80 GPUs,

matching, product recommendation and low-shot classification. However, single
machine solutions are usually insufficient due to the large cardinality of
modern datasets and stringent latency requirement of on-line query processing.
We present Pyramid, a general and efficient framework for distributed
similarity search. Pyramid supports search with popular similarity functions
including Euclidean distance, angular distance and inner product. Different
from existing distributed solutions that are based on KD-tree or locality
sensitive hashing (LSH), Pyramid is based on Hierarchical Navigable Small World
graph (HNSW), which is the state of the art similarity search algorithm on a
single machine. To achieve high query processing throughput, Pyramid partitions
a dataset into sub-datasets containing similar items for index building and
assigns a query to only some of the sub-datasets for query processing. To
provide the robustness required by production deployment, Pyramid also supports
failure recovery and straggler mitigation. Pyramid offers a set of concise API
such that users can easily use Pyramid without knowing the details of
distributed execution. Experiments on large-scale datasets show that Pyramid
produces quality results for similarity search, achieves high query processing
throughput and is robust under node failure and straggler.

algorithmic ACE thresholds to define the presence or absence of a chemical of

un-compressed data cubes provide an approximate ground truth. We demonstrate
that optimization based on either the L1 norm or TV norm results in successful
chemical detection at a compression rate of 90%, but we show that L1
optimization is preferable. We present quantitative comparisons of chemical
detection on reconstructions from the two methods, with an emphasis on the

(CRYPTO 2018) which suggested that a uniform superposition with random
\emph{binary} phase is statistically indistinguishable from a Haar random
state. That is, any polynomial number of copies of the aforementioned state is
within exponentially small trace distance from the same number of copies of a
Haar random state.
  As a consequence, we get a provable elementary construction of
\emph{pseudorandom} quantum states from post-quantum pseudorandom functions.
Generating pseduorandom quantum states is desirable for physical applications
as well as for computational tasks such as quantum money. We observe that
replacing the pseudorandom function with a $(2t)$-wise independent function
(either in our construction or in previous work), results in an explicit
construction for \emph{quantum state $t$-designs} for all $t$. In fact, we show
that the circuit complexity (in terms of both circuit size and depth) of
constructing $t$-designs is bounded by that of $(2t)$-wise independent
functions. Explicitly, while in prior literature $t$-designs required linear
depth (for $t > 2$), this observation shows that polylogarithmic depth suffices
for all $t$.
  We note that our constructions yield pseudorandom states and state designs
with only real-valued amplitudes, which was not previously known. Furthermore,
generating these states require quantum circuit of restricted form: applying
one layer of Hadamard gates, followed by a sequence of Toffoli gates. This
structure may be useful for efficiency and simplicity of implementation.

sciences comes with a unique set of challenges: scientists want physically
interpretable models that can (i) generalize to predict previously unobserved
behaviors, (ii) provide effective forecasting predictions (extrapolation), and
(iii) be certifiable. Autonomous systems will necessarily interact with
changing and uncertain environments, motivating the need for models that can
accurately extrapolate based on physical principles (e.g. Newton's universal
second law for classical mechanics, $F=ma$). Standard ML approaches have shown
impressive performance for predicting dynamics in an interpolatory regime, but
the resulting models often lack interpretability and fail to generalize. We
introduce a unified sparse optimization framework that learns governing
dynamical systems models from data, selecting relevant terms in the dynamics
from a library of possible functions. The resulting models are parsimonious,
have physical interpretations, and can generalize to new parameter regimes. Our
framework allows the use of non-convex sparsity promoting regularization
functions and can be adapted to address key challenges in scientific problems
and data sets, including outliers, parametric dependencies, and physical
constraints. We show that the approach discovers parsimonious dynamical models
on several example systems. This flexible approach can be tailored to the
unique challenges associated with a wide range of applications and data sets,
providing a powerful ML-based framework for learning governing models for

perturbations, such as giant planets, stellar passages, and the galactic tidal
field. We aim to study the dynamical evolution of the comets in the Oort cloud,
accounting for external perturbations (passing stars and the galactic tide). We
first construct an analytical model of stellar encounters. We find that
individual perturbations do not modify the dynamics of the comets in the cloud
unless very close (< 0.5pc) encounters occur. Using proper motions, parallaxes,
and radial velocities from Gaia DR2, we construct an astrometric catalogue of
14,659 stars that are within 50pc from the Sun. For all these stars we
calculate the time and the closest distance to the Sun. We find that the
cumulative effect of relatively distant ($\leq1$ pc) passing stars can perturb
the comets in the Oort cloud. Finally, we study the dynamical evolution of the
comets in the Oort cloud under the influence of multiple stellar encounters
within 2.5pc from the Sun and the galactic tidal field over $\pm10$Myr. We
considered two models for the Oort cloud, compact (a $\leq$0.25 pc) and
extended (a$ \leq0.5$ pc). We find that the cumulative effect of stellar
encounters is the major perturber of the Oort cloud for a compact configuration
while for the extended, the galactic tide is the major perturber. In both
cases, the effect of passing stars and the galactic tide raises the semi-major
axis of $\sim1.1$\% of the comets at the edge of the cloud up to interstellar
regions ($a >0.5$pc). This leads to the creation of transitional interstellar
comets, which might become interstellar objects due to external perturbations.
This raises the question about the existence of a cloud of objects in the

several curves, including the projective line, Hermitian curves, Suzuki curves,
Ree curves, and the Klein curve over the field of eight elements, the maximal
flag, obtained by evaluation in all rational points different from the point

in a proper subset of rational points is isometry-dual. In [3] it is shown, for
a curve of genus $g$, that a flag of one-point AG codes defined with a subset

formulated in terms of maximum sparse ideals of the Weierstrass semigroup of

which can be increased to thousands of years when chilled and stored dry, and
is amenable to automated synthesis and sequencing. Furthermore, the potential
exists for using biochemical processes that act on DNA for performing highly

  Whilst biological information is encoded in DNA as triplet sequences of
nucleotides (also referred to as bases or base pairs) (A,T,G, or C), i.e., base
4 - known as codons - there are many possible encoding schemes that can map
data to chemical sequences of nucleotides for synthesis, storage, retrieval and

employed to address biological constraints, and measures to provide

significant uncertainties. Historically, one of the prevalent methods to
account for this uncertainty has been the standard Monte Carlo (MC) method.
Recently, improved sampling methods have been proposed, based on the idea of
variance reduction by employing a hierarchy of mesh refinements. We combine an
h- and p-refinement hierarchy with the Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) and
Multilevel Quasi-Monte Carlo (MLQMC) method. We investigate the applicability
of these novel combination methods on three structural engineering problems,
for which the uncertainty resides in the Young's modulus: the static response
of a cantilever beam with elastic material behavior, its static response with
elastoplastic behavior, and its dynamic response with elastic behavior. The
uncertainty is either modeled by means of one random variable sampled from a
univariate Gamma distribution or with multiple random variables sampled from a
gamma random field. This random field results from a truncated Karhunen-Lo\`eve
(KL) expansion. In this paper, we compare the computational costs of these
Monte Carlo methods. We demonstrate that MQLMC and MLMC have a significant
speedup with respect to MC, regardless of the mesh refinement hierarchy used.
We empirically demonstrate that the MLQMC cost is optimally proportional to
1/epsilon under certain conditions, where epsilon is the tolerance on the
root-mean-square error (RMSE). In addition, we show that, when the uncertainty
is modeled as a random field, the multilevel methods combined with p-refinement
have a significant lower computation cost than their counterparts based on
h-refinement. We also illustrate the effect the uncertainty models have on the
uncertainty bounds in the solutions.

100 MeV, entropies per particle S/A between 0 and 6, lepton fractions from
Y$_L$=0.0 to 0.6, and baryon number densities n$_B$=0.05-1.2 fm$^{-3}$.
Applications of the QMC-A EoS are made to cold neutron stars (NS) and to hot
proto-neutron stars (PNS) in two scenarios, (i) lepton rich matter with trapped
neutrinos and (ii) deleptonized chemically equilibrated matter. We find that
the QMC-A model predicts hyperons in amounts growing with increasing
temperature and density, thus suggesting not only their presence in PNS but
also, most likely, in NS merger remnants. The nucleon-hyperon phase transition
is studied through the adiabatic index and the speed of sound c$_s$. It is
shown that the lowering of (c$_s$/c)$^2$ to and below the conformal limit of
1/3 is a general consequence of instabilities due to any phase transition and
is not a unique fingerprint of the hadron-quark matter transition. Rigid
rotation of cold and hot stars, their moments of inertia and Kepler frequencies
are also explored.
  The QMC-A model results are compared with two relativistic models, the chiral
mean field model (CMF), and the generalized relativistic density functional
with hyperons (GRDF-Y). Similarities and differences are discussed.

($S_2$) is rigorously analyzed for the nonlinear Dirac equation without
external magnetic potentials in the nonrelativistic regime with a small
parameter $0<\varepsilon\leq 1$ inversely proportional to the speed of light.
In this regime, the solution highly oscillates in time with wavelength at
$O(\varepsilon^2)$. The splitting methods surprisingly show super-resolution,
i.e. the methods can capture the solution accurately even if the time step size
$\tau$ is much larger than the sampled wavelength at $O(\varepsilon^2)$.
Similar to the linear case, $S_1$ and $S_2$ both exhibit $1/2$ order
convergence uniformly with respect to $\varepsilon$. Moreover, if $\tau$ is
non-resonant, i.e. $\tau$ is away from certain region determined by
$\varepsilon$, $S_1$ would yield an improved uniform first order $O(\tau)$
error bound, while $S_2$ would give improved uniform $3/2$ order convergence.
Numerical results are reported to confirm these rigorous results. Furthermore,
we note that super-resolution is still valid for higher order splitting
methods.

electronic structure of monolayer nanoribbons of B$_2$S is modified under
uniaxial strains, then employing a tight-binding framework together with the
conventional theory of elasticity, we discuss how strain-induced local
deformations can be used as a means to affect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida
(RKKY) interaction in zigzag nanoribbons of B$_2$S. We show that breaking
inversion symmetry in zigzag B$_2$S nanoribbons (ZBSNR), e.g., by introducing
staggered sublattice potentials, play a key role in the modulation of their
electronic properties. More interestingly, for the ZBSNRs belong to the group
$M=4p$, with $M$ the width of the ZBSNR and $p$ an integer number, one can see
that a band gap, in which a pair of near-midgap bands completely detached from
the bulk bands is always observed. As a key feature, the position of the midgap
bands in the energy diagram of ZBSNRs can be shifted by applying the in-plane
strains $\varepsilon_x$ and $\varepsilon_y$. Moreover, the near-midgap
bandwidth monotonically decreases with increasing strength of the strain and
increases with the width of the ZBSNR. The energy gap of the ZBSNRs decreased
with increasing the applied strain and ribbon width. The spatial and strain
dependency of the exchange interaction in various configurations of the
magnetic impurities are also evaluated. The magnetic interactions between
adsorbed magnetic impurities in B$_2$S nanoribbons can be manipulated by
careful strain engineering of such systems. Our results suggest that these
tunable electronic and magnetic properties of ZBSNRs mean they may find
applications in spintronics and pseudospin electronics based on monolayer

integer powers, $x^n$. For any positive integer $l$, the theorem establishes
the existence of bijective mappings (permutations) between all $p^l$ members
$x$ of each non-zero residue class mod $p$ satisfying $x < p^{l+1}$. These
mappings are obtained as the integer part of ${x^p}{p^{-\alpha}}$ for a
particular positive integer $\alpha$, depending on $n$ and $p$, called the
""coding shift"", for which an explicit formula is given. For relatively prime
$n$ and $p$, $\alpha = 1$ and the result follows directly from properties of
the multiplicative group of invertible elements modulo $p^{l+1}$. We extend our
result for general $n$ also to identify the coding shift required to obtain
such bijective mappings for members of the zero residue class mod $p$,
demonstrating that such bijective mappings (or encodings) can be found for any
finite $l$ and for all positive integers $x < p^{l+1}$.

a material that has loosely-bounded electrons. Unlike a standard bare tether
equipped with an active electron emitter, LWTs close the electrical circuit
(cathodic contact) with the ambient plasma in a passive manner thanks to the
thermionic and photoelectric effects. This work presents experimental results
on a novel procedure for manufacturing LWT samples. Conductive substrates
(aluminum and copper) have been coated with graphene oxide doped with Cesium by
using a scalable, simple and cost-effective coating method with an airbrush.
Both GO and Cs-doped GO (GO/Cs) samples were characterized utilizing X-ray
spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, four-point probe,
and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). They showed that GO sheets
were successfully doped with Cs atoms, which do not agglomerate on the graphene
sheets and do not form particles. The UPS results indicated that by doping GO
sheets with Cs, the work function of GO decreases from 4.6 eV to 3.09 eV, thus
increasing the applicability of GO as an electron emitter material.

the command and control link, which is the security measure to secure the UAV

concern of having UAVs flying in the no-fly zone and causing troubles from
offending private privacy to hazards at airport airspace. Hence the geofence
system shall provide guidance message, which enables the UAV to evacuate from

illustrate the generation of geofence and then apply the geofence system on UAV
operation. This application enables UAV to fly in the designated area without

Recession and the massive shift into globalization echo today with political
upheaval, anti-establishment propaganda, and looming trade/currency wars that
threaten domestic and international value chains. Once stable entities like the
EU now look fragile and political instability in the US presents unprecedented
challenges to an International Monetary System (IMS) that predominantly relies
on the USD and EUR as reserve currencies. In this environment, it is critical
for an international organization mandated to ensure stability to plan and act
ahead. This paper argues that Decentralized Ledger-based technology (DLT) is
key for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to mitigate some of those risks,
promote stability and safeguard world prosperity. Over the last two years, DLT
has made headline news globally and created a worldwide excitement not seen
since the internet entered the mainstream. The rapid adoption and open-to-all
philosophy of DLT has already redefined global socioeconomics, promises to
shake up the world of commerce/finance and challenges the workings of central
governments/regulators. This paper examines DLT core premises and proposes a
two-step approach for the IMF to expand Special Drawing Rights (SDR) into that
sphere so as to become the originally envisioned numeraire and reserve currency
for cross-border transactions in this new decentralized century.

devices, in which the acoustic waves are generated and propagate along the
surface of a piezoelectric substrate. Despite their wide-spread use, only a few
fully three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations have been presented in the
literature. In this paper, we present a 3D numerical simulation taking into
account the electromechanical fields of the piezoelectric SAW device, the
acoustic displacement field in the attached elastic material, in which the
liquid-filled microchannel is embedded, the acoustic fields inside the
microchannel, as well as the resulting acoustic radiation force and
streaming-induced drag force acting on micro- and nanoparticles suspended in
the microchannel. A specific device design is presented, for which the
numerical predictions of the acoustic resonances and the acoustophoretic
repsonse of suspended microparticles in 3D are successfully compared with
experimental observations. The simulation provides a physical explanation of
the the observed qualitative difference between devices with an acoustically
soft and hard lid in terms of traveling and standing waves, respectively. The
simulations also correctly predict the existence and position of the observed
in-plane streaming flow rolls. The presented simulation model may be useful in
the development of SAW devices optimized for various acoustofluidic tasks.

2D fluoroscopy imaging. Tracking systems based on fiber Bragg gratings are an
emerging technology for the navigation of minimal-invasive instruments which
can reduce the x-ray exposure and the used contrast agent. Shape sensing of
flexible structures is challenging and includes many calculations steps which
are prone to different errors. To reduce this errors, we present an optimized
shape sensing model. Methods: We analyzed for every step of the shape sensing
process, which errors can occur, how the error affects the shape and how it can
be compensated or minimized. Experiments were done with a multicore fiber
system with 38 cm sensing length and the effects of different methods and
parameters were analyzed. Furthermore we compared 3D shape reconstructions with
the segmented shape of the corresponding CT scans of the fiber to evaluate the
accuracy of our optimized shape sensing model. Finally we tested our model in a
realistic endovascular scenario by using a 3D printed vessel system created
from patient data. Results: Depending on the complexity of the shape we reached
an average error of 0.35 to 1.15 mm and maximal error of 0.75 to 7.53 mm over
the whole 38 cm sensing length. In the endovascular scenario we obtained an
average and maximal error of 1.13 mm and 2.11 mm, respectively. Conclusions:
The accuracies of the 3D shape sensing model are promising and we plan to
combine the shape sensing based on fiber Bragg gratings with the position and
orientation of an electromagnetic sensor system to obtain the located shape of
the catheter.
