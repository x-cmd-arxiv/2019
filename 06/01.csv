Furthermore, an unpaired electron is less likely to react chemically, when it
is placed in an extended orbital. Here, we use the tip of a scanning tunneling
microscope to abstract one of the pyrrolic hydrogen atoms from phthalocyanine
(H2Pc) deposited on a single layer of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) on Au(111).
We show the successful dissociation reaction by current-induced three-level
fluctuations reflecting the inequivalent positions of the remaining H atom in
the pyrrole center. Tunneling spectroscopy reveals two narrow resonances inside
the semiconducting energy gap of MoS2 with their spatial extent resembling the
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of H2Pc. By comparison to simple
density functional calculations of the isolated molecule, we show that these
correspond to a single occupation of the Coulomb-split highest molecular
orbital of HPc. We conclude that the dangling $\sigma$ bond after N-H bond
cleavage is filled by an electron from the delocalized HOMO. The extended
nature of the HOMO together with the inert nature of the MoS2 layer favor the
stabilization of this radical state.

Lyman-alpha luminosity function (LF) based on deep observations of four lensing
clusters. The precise aim of the present study is to further constrain the
abundance of Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) by taking advantage of the
magnification provided by lensing clusters. We blindly selected a sample of 156
LAEs, with redshifts between $2.9 \le z \le 6.7$ and magnification-corrected
luminosities in the range $ 39 \lesssim \log L_{Ly_{\alpha}}$ [erg s$^{-1}$]
$\lesssim 43$. The price to pay to benefit from magnification is a reduction of
the effective volume of the survey, together with a more complex analysis
procedure. To properly take into account the individual differences in
detection conditions (including lensing configurations, spatial and spectral
morphologies) when computing the LF, a new method based on the 1/Vmax approach
was implemented. The LAE LF has been obtained in four different redshift bins
with constraints down to $\log L_{Ly_{\alpha}} = 40.5$. From our data only, no
significant evolution of LF mean slope can be found. When performing a
Schechter analysis including data from the literature to complete the present
sample a steep faint-end slope was measured varying from $\alpha =
-1.69^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ to $\alpha = -1.87^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$ between the lowest
and the highest redshift bins. The contribution of the LAE population to the
star formation rate density at $z \sim 6$ is $\lesssim 50$% depending on the
luminosity limit considered, which is of the same order as the Lyman-break
galaxy (LBG) contribution. The evolution of the LAE contribution with redshift
depends on the assumed escape fraction of Lyman-alpha photons, and appears to
slightly increase with increasing redshift when this fraction is conservatively
set to one. (abridged)

three new symbiotic stars in the Draco dSph with X-ray luminosities between

is employed at the level of hyper-parameter optimization, a bandit strategy
runs at the level of algorithm selection to allocate the budget based on the

extreme region of the underlying feedback distribution. We show theoretically
that the ER-UCB has a regret upper bound $O\left(K \ln n\right)$ with

also conduct experiments on a synthetic problem as well as a set of AutoML

Below 230 K, $\gamma_p$ rises more rapidly on cooling than predicted from

is correlated to the emergence of a well-structured random tetrahedral network

and relevant for micro-prudential requirements. While several methods exist for
measuring credit concentration risk within institutions, the systemic effect of
different institutions' exposures to the same counterparties has been less
explored so far. In this paper, we propose a measure of the systemic credit
concentration risk that arises because of common exposures between different
institutions within a financial system. This approach is based on a network
model that describes the effect of overlapping portfolios. This network metric
is applied to synthetic and real world data to illustrate that the effect of
common exposures is not fully reflected in single portfolio concentration
measures. It also allows to quantify several aspects of the interplay between
interconnectedness and credit risk. Using this network measure, we formulate an
analytical approximation for the additional capital requirement corresponding
to the systemic risk arising from credit concentration interconnectedness. Our
methodology also avoids double counting between the granularity adjustment and
the common exposure adjustment. Although approximated, this common exposure
adjustment is able to capture, with only two parameters, an aspect of systemic
risk that can extend single portfolios view to a system-wide one.

degeneracies in the optimization landscape, a problem also known as
vanishing/exploding gradients. Short of designing new RNN architectures,
previous methods for dealing with this problem usually boil down to
orthogonalization of the recurrent dynamics, either at initialization or during
the entire training period. The basic motivation behind these methods is that
orthogonal transformations are isometries of the Euclidean space, hence they
preserve (Euclidean) norms and effectively deal with vanishing/exploding
gradients. However, this ignores the crucial effects of non-linearity and
noise. In the presence of a non-linearity, orthogonal transformations no longer
preserve norms, suggesting that alternative transformations might be better
suited to non-linear networks. Moreover, in the presence of noise, norm
preservation itself ceases to be the ideal objective. A more sensible objective
is maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the propagated signal instead.
Previous work has shown that in the linear case, recurrent networks that
maximize the SNR display strongly non-normal, sequential dynamics and
orthogonal networks are highly suboptimal by this measure. Motivated by this
finding, here we investigate the potential of non-normal RNNs, i.e. RNNs with a
non-normal recurrent connectivity matrix, in sequential processing tasks. Our
experimental results show that non-normal RNNs outperform their orthogonal
counterparts in a diverse range of benchmarks. We also find evidence for
increased non-normality and hidden chain-like feedforward motifs in trained
RNNs initialized with orthogonal recurrent connectivity matrices.

store and retrieve non-sparse data contiguous in memory. Arrays are important
for the performance of many memory-intensive applications due to the design of
modern memory hierarchies: contiguous storage facilitates spatial locality and
predictive access patterns which enables prefetching. Operations on large
arrays often lend themselves well to parallelisation, such as a fork-join style
divide-and-conquer algorithm for sorting. For parallel operations on arrays to
be deterministic, data-race freedom must be guaranteed. For operations on
arrays of primitive data, data-race freedom is obtained by coordinating
accesses so that no two threads operate on the same array indices. This is
however not enough for arrays of non-primitives due to aliasing: accesses of
separate array elements may return pointers to the same object, or overlapping
structures. Reference capabilities have been used successfully in the past to
statically guarantee the absence of data-races in object-oriented programs.
This paper presents the first extension of reference capabilities -- called
array capabilities -- that support concurrent and parallel operations on arrays
of both primitive and non-primitive values. In addition to element access,
array capabilities support the abstract manipulation of arrays, logical
splitting of arrays into subarrays, and merging subarrays. These operations
allow expressing a wide range of array use cases. This paper presents the array
capability design space and show how it applies to a number of array use cases.
The core ideas are formalised and proven sound in a simple calculus, along with
a proof that shows that well-typed programs with array capabilities are free
from data-races.

not constant. In order to further explore into these results we also compute a
non-commutativity measure of quantum correlations to analyze the behavior of

the critical issues is how the experience is represented and stored.
Previously, the experience can be stored in the forms of features, individual
models, and the average model, each lying at a different granularity. However,
new tasks may require experience across multiple granularities. In this paper,
we propose the policy residual representation (PRR) network, which can extract
and store multiple levels of experience. PRR network is trained on a set of
tasks with a multi-level architecture, where a module in each level corresponds
to a subset of the tasks. Therefore, the PRR network represents the experience
in a spectrum-like way. When training on a new task, PRR can provide different
levels of experience for accelerating the learning. We experiment with the PRR
network on a set of grid world navigation tasks, locomotion tasks, and fighting
tasks in a video game. The results show that the PRR network leads to better
reuse of experience and thus outperforms some state-of-the-art approaches.

insight is that unlabeled data can be a competitive alternative to labeled data

pebble a vertex if a pebble is left on it after some sequence of moves, each of
which takes two pebbles from some vertex and places one on an adjacent vertex.
A distribution is solvable if all vertices are pebblable; the pebbling
threshold of a sequence of graphs is, roughly speaking, the total number of
pebbles for which random distributions with that number of pebbles on a graph
in the sequence change from being almost never solvable to being almost always
solvable. We show that any sequence of connected graphs with strictly
increasing orders always has some pebbling threshold which is
$\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ and $O(2^{\sqrt{2 \log_2 n}} n/\sqrt{\log_2 n})$, and that
it is possible to construct such a sequence of connected graphs which has any
desired pebbling threshold between these bounds. (Here, $n$ is the order of a
graph in the sequence.) It follows that the sequence of paths, which, improving
earlier estimates, we show has pebbling threshold $\Theta(2^{\sqrt{\log_2 n}}
n/\sqrt{\log_2 n})$, does not have the greatest possible pebbling threshold.

initially uniform into a quasi-radial field. Equipartition between magnetic and
kinetic energies in the falling gas is established in the developed stages of
the flow. Estimates of the synchrotron radiation intensity are presented for
the stationary flow. The main part of the radiation is formed in the region $r
\leq 7 r_g$, here $r_g$ is a BH gravitational radius. The two-dimensional
stationary self-similar magnetohydrodynamic solution is obtained for the matter
accretion into BH, in a presence of a large-scale magnetic field, when the
magnetic field far from the BH is homogeneous and does not influence the flow.
At the symmetry plane perpendicular to the direction of the distant magnetic
field, the quasi-stationary disk is formed around BH, which structure is
determined by dissipation processes. Parameters of the shock forming due to
matter infall onto the disk are obtained. The radiation spectrum of the disk
and the shock are obtained for the $10\,\, M_\odot$ BH. The luminosity of such
object is about the solar one, for a characteristic galactic gas density, with
possibility of observation at distances less than 1 kpc. The spectra of a
laminar and a turbulent disk structure around BH are very different. The
turbulent disk emits a large part of its flux in the infrared. It may occur
that some of the galactic infrared star-like sources are a single BH in the
turbulent accretion state. The radiative efficiency of the magnetized disk is
very high, reaching $\sim 0.5\,\dot M\,c^2$ so it was called recently as a
magnetically arrested disk (MAD). Numerical simulations of MAD, and its
appearance during accretion into neutron stars are considered and discussed.

sheared in the vertical direction. When we perturb the front an instability
quickly corrugates the front. We identify this instability as the baroclinic

{\sim} 10 times faster than in the unperturbed case and distinct flame vortices

was known to be associated with a galaxy group of dynamical mass M_group ~3e12
M_sun, but its physical origin remained ambiguous. New wide-field integral
field observations revealed a giant nebula detected in [OII], H{\beta}, [OIII],
H{\alpha}, and [NII] emission, with the line-emitting gas following closely the
motions of group galaxies. One of the denser streams passes directly in front
of the QSO with kinematics consistent with the absorption profiles recorded in
the QSO echelle spectra. The emission morphology, kinematics, and line ratios
of the nebula suggest that shocks and turbulent mixing layers, produced as a
result of stripped gaseous streams moving at supersonic speed across the
ambient hot medium, contribute significantly to the ionization of the gas.
While the DLA may not be associated with any specific detected member of the
group, both the kinematic and dust properties are consistent with the DLA
originating in streams of gas stripped from sub-L* group members at <~25 pkpc
from the QSO sightline. This study demonstrates that gas stripping in low-mass
galaxy groups is effective in releasing metal-enriched gas from star-forming
regions, producing absorption systems in QSO spectra, and that combining
absorption and emission-line observations provides an exciting new opportunity
for studying gas and galaxy co-evolution.

by the JPEG image compression method. This approach is motivated specifically
by the need for accurate modeling of high-magnification regions in galaxy
clusters. Existing modeling methods may struggle in these regions due to their
limited flexibility in the parametrization of the lens, even for a wide variety
of free-form methods. This limitation especially hinders the characterization
of faint galaxies at high redshifts, which have important implications for the
formation of the first galaxies and even for the nature of dark matter. JPEG
images are extremely accurate representations of their original, uncompressed
counterparts but use only a fraction of number of parameters to represent that
information. Its relevance is immediately obvious to cluster lens modeling.
Using this technique, it is possible to construct flexible models that are
capable of accurately reproducing the true mass distribution using only a small
number of free parameters. Transferring this well-proven technology to cluster
lens modeling, I demonstrate that this `JPEG parametrization' is indeed
flexible enough to accurately approximate an N-body simulated cluster.

two phases: an initial in-situ-dominated one followed by an ex-situ-dominated
evolution. Separating these two contributions is therefore crucial to
understand the baryonic cycle within massive halos. A recently discovered
population of so-called naked red nuggets, galaxies that shortcut the ex-situ
stage preserving their pristine properties, presents a unique opportunity to
study in detail star formation in massive galaxies without the confounding
effect of later accretion. We investigate the spatially resolved star formation
histories of a sample of 12 naked red nuggets. We measure how their radial
light distributions, star formation rates and central densities evolved in
time. We find that, while forming stars, red nuggets become gradually more
concentrated, reaching a maximum concentration at quenching. After being
quenched, they kept forming stars in a more disky-like configuration. Our
measurements suggest that super-massive black holes and host galaxies grow
their mass in a self-regulated way until a characteristic Mbh/Mhalo is reached.
Once black holes are massive enough, red nuggets get quenched and depart from
the star formation main sequence. While in the main sequence, red nuggets
evolve at roughly constant star formation rate. This can explain up to ~0.3 dex
of the scatter of the star formation main sequence, as well as its higher
normalization observed in the early Universe. Hence, our results suggest that
the main sequence is composed of populations of galaxies at different
evolutionary stages, and that the scatter is therefore due to secular
processes.

be well-described by a Salpeter-like IMF slope at M > 10 M_sun and that a

to the Standard Model, the lightest particle in the hidden sector will
generically be long-lived and could come to dominate the energy density of the
universe prior to the onset of nucleosynthesis. During this early
matter-dominated era, density perturbations will grow more quickly than
otherwise predicted, leading to a large abundance of sub-earth-mass dark matter
microhalos. Since the dark matter does not couple directly to the Standard
Model, the minimum halo mass is much smaller than expected for weakly
interacting dark matter, and the smallest halos could form during the
radiation-dominated era. In this paper, we calculate the evolution of density
perturbations within the context of such hidden sector models and use a series
of $N$-body simulations to determine the outcome of nonlinear collapse during
radiation domination. The resulting microhalos are extremely dense, which leads
to very high rates of dark matter annihilation and to large indirect detection
signals that resemble those ordinarily predicted for decaying dark matter. We
find that the Fermi Collaboration's measurement of the high-latitude gamma-ray
background rules out a wide range of parameter space within this class of
models. The scenarios that are most difficult to constrain are those that
feature a very long early matter-dominated era; if microhalos form prior to the
decay of the unstable hidden sector matter, the destruction of these microhalos
effectively heats the dark matter, suppressing the later formation of
microhalos.

subsequently captured into Neptune's 3:2 mean motion resonance (the Plutinos)
as well as the hot classical Kuiper belt population. We do not find a
consistent relationship between the degree of test particle inclination
excitation and e-folding planet migration timescales in the range 5-50 Myr. Our
results present a counter-example to Nesvorny 2015's finding that the Plutino
and hot classical inclinations showed a marked increase with increasing
e-folding timescales for Neptune's migration. We argue that these differing
results are likely due to differing secular architectures of the giant planets
during and after migration. Small changes in the planets' initial conditions
and differences in the numerical implementation of planet migration can result
in different amplitudes of the planets' inclination secular modes, and this can
lead to different final inclination distributions for test particles in the
simulations. We conclude that the observed large inclination dispersion of
Kuiper belt objects does not require Neptune's migration to be slow; planetary
migration with e-folding timescales of 5, 10, 30, and 50 Myr can all yield
inclination dispersions similar to the observed Plutino and hot classical

the general theory of relativity, the energy-momentum squared gravity model
$f(R,\mathbf{T^2})$, where $R$ represents the scalar curvature and
$\mathbf{T^2}$ the square of the energy-momentum tensor. By using dynamical
system analysis for various types of gravity functions $f(R,\mathbf{T^2})$, we
have studied the structure of the phase space and the physical implications of
the energy-momentum squared coupling. In the first case of functional where
$f(R,\mathbf{T^2})=f_0 R^n(\mathbf{T^2})^m$, with $f_0$ constant, we have shown
that the phase space structure has a reduced complexity, with a high
sensitivity to the values of the $m$ and $n$ parameters. Depending on the
values of the $m$ and $n$ parameters, the model exhibits various cosmological
epochs, corresponding to matter eras, solutions associated with an accelerated
expansion, or decelerated periods. The second model studied corresponds to the
$f(R,\mathbf{T^2})=\alpha R^n+\beta\mathbf{(T^2)}^m$ form with $\alpha, \beta$
constant parameters. In this case, a richer phase space structure is obtained
which can recover different cosmological scenarios, associated to matter eras,
de--Sitter solutions, and dark energy epochs. Hence, this model represents an
interesting cosmological model which can explain the current evolution of the
Universe and the emergence of the accelerated expansion as a geometrical
consequence.

reuse passwords for multiple websites. A common complaint is that utilizing
secure passwords is too difficult. One possible solution to this problem is to
use a password schema. Password schemas are deterministic functions which map
challenges (typically the website name) to responses (passwords). Previous work
has been done on developing and analyzing publishable schemas, but these
analyses have been information-theoretic, not complexity-theoretic; they
consider an adversary with infinite computing power.
  We perform an analysis with respect to adversaries having currently
achievable computing capabilities, assessing the realistic practical security
of such schemas. We prove for several specific schemas that a computer is no
worse off than an infinite adversary and that it can successfully extract all
information from leaked challenges and their respective responses, known as
challenge-response pairs. We also show that any schema that hopes to be secure
against adversaries with bounded computation should obscure information in a
very specific way, by introducing many possible constraints with each
challenge-response pair. These surprising results put the analyses of password
schemas on a more solid and practical footing.

spaces of probability distributions. Optimal transport characterizes the
cost-minimizing movement from one distribution to another, while information
geometry originates from coordinate-invariant properties of statistical
inference. Their connections and applications in statistics and machine
learning have started to gain more attention. In this paper we give a new
differential geometric connection between the two fields. Namely, the
pseudo-Riemannian framework of Kim and McCann, a geometric perspective on the
fundamental Ma-Trudinger-Wang (MTW) condition in the regularity theory of
optimal transport maps, encodes the dualistic structure of statistical
manifold. This general relation is described using the natural framework of
$c$-divergence, a divergence defined by an optimal transport map. As a
by-product, we obtain a new information-geometric interpretation of the MTW
tensor. This connection sheds light on old and new aspects of information
geometry. The dually flat geometry of Bregman divergence corresponds to the
quadratic cost and the pseudo-Euclidean space, and the
$L^{(\alpha)}$-divergence introduced by Pal and the first author has constant
sectional curvature in a sense to be made precise. In these cases we give a
geometric interpretation of the information-geometric curvature in terms of the

derivation of the generalized Gauss law for in-medium quarkonium, combining the
non-perturbative physics of the vacuum bound state with a weak coupling
description of the medium degrees of freedom. Its relation to previous models
in the literature is discussed. We show that our approach is able to reproduce
the complex lattice QCD heavy quark potential even in the non-perturbative

After vetting the Gauss-law potential with state-of-the-art lattice QCD data,
we extend it to the regime of finite baryon density and finite velocity,
currently inaccessible to first principles simulations. In-medium spectral

estimate the $\psi'/J/\psi$ ratio in heavy-ion collisions at different beam

called chambers, and a well-known theorem of Zaslavsky counts chambers as a sum
of nonnegative integers called Whitney numbers of the first kind. His theorem
generalizes to count chambers within any cone defined as the intersection of a
collection of halfspaces from the arrangement, leading to a notion of Whitney
numbers for each cone. This paper focuses on cones within the braid
arrangement, consisting of the reflecting hyperplanes $x_i=x_j$ inside
$\mathbb{R}^n$ for the symmetric group, thought of as the type $A_{n-1}$
reflection group. Here cones correspond to posets, chambers within the cone
correspond to linear extensions of the poset, and the Whitney numbers of the
cone interestingly refine the number of linear extensions of the poset. We
interpret this refinement for all posets as counting linear extensions
according to a statistic that generalizes the number of left-to-right maxima of
a permutation. When the poset is a disjoint union of chains, we interpret this
refinement differently, using Foata's theory of cycle decomposition for
multiset permutations, leading to a simple generating function compiling these
Whitney numbers.

dust temperatures are best understood as evidence for optically thick dust
continuum in the FIR, rather than the result of low star formation efficiency
with rapid metal enrichment. We provide direct evidence that, given their cold
spectral energy distributions, CMB plays a significant role biasing their
observed Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) slopes to unlikely steep values and, possibly,
reducing their CO fluxes by a factor of two. We recover standard RJ slopes when

range, with an emphasis on the latest results from short baseline oscillation
experiments and how they fit within sterile neutrino oscillation models. We
present global fit results to a three-active-flavor plus one-sterile-flavor
model (3+1), where we find an improvement of $\Delta \chi^2=35$ for 3
additional parameters compared to a model with no sterile neutrino. This is a
5$\sigma$ improvement, indicating that an effect that is like that of a sterile
neutrino is highly preferred by the data. However we note that separate fits to
the appearance and disappearance oscillation data sets within a 3+1 model do
not show the expected overlapping allowed regions in parameter space. This
""tension"" leads us to explore two options: 3+2, where a second additional mass
state is introduced, and a 3+1+decay model, where the $\nu_4$ state can decay
to invisible particles. The 3+1+decay model, which is also motivated by
improving compatibility with cosmological observations, yields the larger
improvement, with a $\Delta \chi^2=8$ for 1 additional parameter beyond the 3+1
model, which is a $2.6\sigma$ improvement. Moreover the tension between
appearance and disappearance experiments is reduced compared to 3+1, although
disagreement remains. In these studies, we use a frequentist approach and also
a Bayesean method of finding credible regions.
  With respect to this tension, we review possible problems with the global
fitting method. We note multiple issues, including problems with reproducing
the experimental results, especially in the case of experiments that do not
provide adequate data releases. We discuss an unexpected 5 MeV excess, observed
in the reactor flux energy spectrum, that may be affecting the oscillation
interpretation of the short baseline reactor data. We emphasize the care that
must be taken in mapping to the true neutrino energy in the case of oscillation
experiments that are subject to multiple interaction modes and nuclear effects.
We point to problems with the ""Parameter-Goodness-of-Fit test"" that is used to
quantify the tension. Lastly, we point out that analyses presenting limits

representing the behaviors of recursive programs that interact with their
environments. A coinductive variant of ""free monads,"" ITrees are built out of
uninterpreted events and their continuations. They support compositional
construction of interpreters from ""event handlers"", which give meaning to
events by defining their semantics as monadic actions. ITrees are expressive
enough to represent impure and potentially nonterminating, mutually recursive
computations, while admitting a rich equational theory of equivalence up to
weak bisimulation. In contrast to other approaches such as relationally
specified operational semantics, ITrees are executable via code extraction,
making them suitable for debugging, testing, and implementing software
artifacts that are amenable to formal verification.
  We have implemented ITrees and their associated theory as a Coq library,
mechanizing classic domain- and category-theoretic results about program
semantics, iteration, monadic structures, and equational reasoning. Although
the internals of the library rely heavily on coinductive proofs, the interface
hides these details so that clients can use and reason about ITrees without
explicit use of Coq's coinduction tactics.
  To showcase the utility of our theory, we prove the termination-sensitive
correctness of a compiler from a simple imperative source language to an
assembly-like target whose meanings are given in an ITree-based denotational
semantics. Unlike previous results using operational techniques, our
bisimulation proof follows straightforwardly by structural induction and
elementary rewriting via an equational theory of combinators for control-flow
graphs.

outputs of primary interest are predicted probabilities, commonly referred to
as scores. We formulate the problem of transforming scores to satisfy fairness
constraints that are linear in conditional means of scores while minimizing a
cross-entropy objective. The formulation can be applied directly to
post-process classifier outputs and we also explore a pre-processing extension,
thus allowing maximum freedom in selecting a classification algorithm. We
derive a closed-form expression for the optimal transformed scores and a convex
optimization problem for the transformation parameters. In the population
limit, the transformed score function is the fairness-constrained minimizer of
cross-entropy with respect to the true conditional probability of the outcome.
In the finite sample setting, we propose a method called FairScoreTransformer
to approach this solution using a combination of standard probabilistic
classifiers and ADMM. We provide several consistency and finite-sample
guarantees for FairScoreTransformer, relating to the transformation parameters
and transformed score function that it obtains. Comprehensive experiments
comparing to 10 existing methods show that FairScoreTransformer has advantages
for score-based metrics such as Brier score and AUC while remaining competitive
for binary label-based metrics such as accuracy.

(reflection) theorems, the center and radius of the inversion circle are
obtained. Inside any one of the three given circles, a circle of the similar
radius and concentric with its own corresponding original circle is drawn.The
tangent circle to these three similar circles is obtained. Then the inverted
circles of the three similar circles and the tangent circle regarding an
obtainable point and a computable power of inversion (reflection) constant are
obtained. These circles (three inverted circles and an inverted tangent
circle)will be tangent together.Just,we obtain another reflection point and
power of inversion so that those three reflected circles (inversions of three
similar circles) can be reflections of three original circles, respectively. In
such a case,the reflected circle tangent to three reflected circles regarding
same new inversion system will be tangent to the three original ones. This
circle is our desirable circle. A drawing algorithm is also given for drawing
desirable circle by straightedge and compass. A survey of conformal mapping
theory and inversion in higher dimensions is also accomplished. Although,
Laguerre transformation might be used for solution of this problem, but we do
not make use of this method. Our novelty is just for drawing a circle tangent

They have recently emerged as promising hardware platforms for stochastic

harnessed for probabilistic bits. Here, we have studied how the statistics of
the magnetization fluctuations (e.g. the power spectral density) is affected by
(i) moderate variations in the barrier height of the nanomagnet and (ii) the
presence of structural defects, in order to assess how robust the computing

to moderate barrier height change and also relatively insensitive to the
presence of small localized defects. However, extended (delocalized) defects,
such as thickness variations over a significant fraction of the nanomagnet,
affect the power spectral density very noticeably. As a result, small
variations in the shape (causing small variations in the barrier height), or
small localized defects, are relatively innocuous and tolerable, but
significant variation of the nanomagnet thickness is not. Consequently, tight
control over the nanomagnet thickness must be maintained for stochastic

reinforce our pre-existing beliefs instead of balancing our opinions. This
finding is a concern for the health of our democracies which rely on an access
to information providing diverse viewpoints. To tackle this issue from a
computational perspective, Garimella et al. (NIPS'17) modeled the spread of
these viewpoints, also called campaigns, using the well-known independent
cascade model and studied an optimization problem that aims at balancing
information exposure in a social network when two opposing campaigns propagate
in the network. The objective in their $NP$-hard optimization problem is to
maximize the number of people that are exposed to either both or none of the
viewpoints. For two different settings, one corresponding to a model where
campaigns spread in a correlated manner, and a second one, where the two
campaigns spread in a heterogeneous manner, they provide constant ratio
approximation algorithms. In this paper, we investigate a more general
formulation of this problem. That is, we assume that $\mu$ different campaigns
propagate in a social network and we aim to maximize the number of people that
are exposed to either $\nu$ or none of the campaigns, where $\mu\ge\nu\ge2$. We
provide dedicated approximation algorithms for both the correlated and
heterogeneous settings. Interestingly, for the heterogeneous setting with
$\nu\ge 3$, we give a reduction leading to several approximation hardness
results. Maybe most importantly, we obtain that the problem cannot be
approximated within a factor of $n^{-g(n)}$ for any $g(n)=o(1)$ assuming
Gap-ETH, denoting with $n$ the number of nodes in the social network. For $\nu
\ge 4$, there is no $n^{-\epsilon}$-approximation algorithm if a certain class

occurring. In this paper we present results from high-resolution 3-D

setting a limit on the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux required to drive the
photo-evaporated planetary material to larger radii and line-of-sight

expected for HD 209458, radiation pressure is unlikely to significantly affect
photoevaporative winds or to explain the high velocities at which wind material
is observed, though further possibilities remain to be investigated.

such as information retrieval, traffic management, spectrum sensing, and signal
authentication. While there is a surge of interest to understand the security
issues of machine learning, their implications have not been understood yet for
wireless applications such as those in IoT systems that are susceptible to
various attacks due the open and broadcast nature of wireless communications.
To support IoT systems with heterogeneous devices of different priorities, we
present new techniques built upon adversarial machine learning and apply them
to three types of over-the-air (OTA) wireless attacks, namely jamming, spectrum
poisoning, and priority violation attacks. By observing the spectrum, the
adversary starts with an exploratory attack to infer the channel access
algorithm of an IoT transmitter by building a deep neural network classifier
that predicts the transmission outcomes. Based on these prediction results, the
wireless attack continues to either jam data transmissions or manipulate
sensing results over the air (by transmitting during the sensing phase) to fool
the transmitter into making wrong transmit decisions in the test phase
(corresponding to an evasion attack). When the IoT transmitter collects sensing
results as training data to retrain its channel access algorithm, the adversary
launches a causative attack to manipulate the input data to the transmitter
over the air. We show that these attacks with different levels of energy
consumption and stealthiness lead to significant loss in throughput and success
ratio in wireless communications for IoT systems. Then we introduce a defense
mechanism that systematically increases the uncertainty of the adversary at the
inference stage and improves the performance. Results provide new insights on
how to attack and defend IoT networks using deep learning.

There is thus a crucial gap between sentence selection and fusion to support

attempts to bridge the gap by ranking sentence singletons and pairs together in

give a spectral triple and a K-homology class in $KK_0(A_\theta\otimes
A_\theta, \mathbb{C})$ providing the co-unit for a Poincar\'e self-duality for
the irrational rotation algebra $A_\theta$ for any $\theta\in

studied since. Connes' proof, however, relied on a K-theory computation and
does not supply a representative cycle for the unit of this duality. Since such
representatives are vital in applications of duality, we supply such a cycle in
unbounded form in this article. Our approach is to construct, for any
non-trivial element $g$ of the modular group, a finitely generated projective
module $\mathcal{L}_g$ over $A_\theta \otimes A_\theta$ by using a
reduction-to-a-transversal argument of Muhly, Renault, and Williams, applied to
a pair of Kronecker foliations along lines of slope $\theta$ and $g(\theta)$,
using the fact that these flows are transverse to each other. We then compute
Connes' dual of $[\mathcal{L}_g]$ for $g$ upper triangular, and prove that we
obtain an invertible in $KK_0(A_\theta, A_\theta)$, represented by what one
might regard as a noncommutative bundle of Dirac-Schr\""odinger operators. An
application of $\mathbb{Z}$-equivariant Bott Periodicity proves that twisting
the module by the family gives the requisite spectral cycle for the unit, thus
proving self-duality for $A_\theta$ with both unit and co-unit represented by
spectral cycles.

the information that can be gained about their separation using traditional

Assuming the sources are of equal intensity, Rayleigh's ""curse"" can be
alleviated by making phase-sensitive measurements in the image plane. However,
with unequal and unknown intensities the curse returns regardless of the
measurement, though the ideal scheme would still outperform image plane
counting (IPC), i.e., recording intensities on a screen. We analyze the limits
of the SPLICE phase measurement scheme as the intensity imbalance between the
emitters grows. We find that SPLICE still outperforms IPC for moderately
disparate intensities. For larger intensity imbalances we propose a hybrid of
IPC and SPLICE, which we call ""adapted SPLICE"", requiring only simple
modifications. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we identify regions (emitter
brightness, separation, intensity imbalance) where it is advantageous to use
SPLICE over IPC, and when to switch to the adapted SPLICE measurement. We find
that adapted SPLICE can outperform IPC for large intensity imbalances, e.g.,
10,000:1, with the advantage growing with greater disparity between the two
intensities. Finally, we also propose additional phase measurements for
estimating the statistical moments of more complex source distributions. Our

compatible a particular function, we choose the smallest such matrix in the
Frobenius norm to encode the structure of this function. The Lipschitz matrix
then provides a function-dependent metric on the input space. Altering this
metric to reflect a particular function improves the performance of many tasks
in computational science. Compared to the Lipschitz constant, the Lipschitz
matrix reduces the worst-case cost of approximation, integration, and
optimization; if the Lipschitz matrix is low-rank, this cost no longer depends
on the dimension of the input, but instead on the rank of the Lipschitz matrix
defeating the curse of dimensionality. Both the Lipschitz constant and matrix
define uncertainty away from point queries of the function and by using the
Lipschitz matrix we can reduce uncertainty. If we build a minimax space-filling
design of experiments in the Lipschitz matrix metric, we can further reduce
this uncertainty. When the Lipschitz matrix is approximately low-rank, we can
perform parameter reduction by constructing a ridge approximation whose active
subspace is the span of the dominant eigenvectors of the Lipschitz matrix. In
summary, the Lipschitz matrix provides a new tool for analyzing and performing
parameter reduction in complex models arising in computational science.

  Virus Game",,,,,"cs.GT cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Price of Anarchy (PoA) is a well-established game-theoretic concept to
shed light on coordination issues arising in open distributed systems. Leaving
agents to selfishly optimize comes with the risk of ending up in sub-optimal
states (in terms of performance and/or costs), compared to a centralized system
design. However, the PoA relies on strong assumptions about agents' rationality
(e.g., resources and information) and interactions, whereas in many distributed
systems agents interact locally with bounded resources. They do so repeatedly
over time (in contrast to ""one-shot games""), and their strategies may evolve.
Using a more realistic evolutionary game model, this paper introduces a
realized evolutionary Price of Anarchy (ePoA). The ePoA allows an exploration
of equilibrium selection in dynamic distributed systems with multiple
equilibria, based on local interactions of simple memoryless agents.
Considering a fundamental game related to virus propagation on networks, we
present analytical bounds on the ePoA in basic network topologies and for
different strategy update dynamics. In particular, deriving stationary
distributions of the stochastic evolutionary process, we find that the Nash
equilibria are not always the most abundant states, and that different
processes can feature significant off-equilibrium behavior, leading to a
significantly higher ePoA compared to the PoA studied traditionally in the
literature.

Mainly due to
its morphology, the nebula has been suggested to be a 0.5 Myr-old supernova
remnant (SNR) that could be inducing star formation in the CMa OB1 association.
We aim to show, for the first time, that the nebula is part of a large,
shell-like structure, which we have designated the ``CMa shell'', enclosing a
bubble created by successive supernova (SN) explosions. We identified three
runaway stars, associated with bow-shock structures, in the direction of the
CMa shell and we investigate the possibility that they have originated in the
center of the shell. By analyzing images of the CMa OB1 association at several
wavelengths, we clearly see that the Sh2-296 nebula is in fact part of a large
structure, which can be approximated by a large (with a diameter of ~60 pc)
elliptical shell. Using the recent Gaia-DR2 astrometric data, we trace back the
path of the three runaway stars, in order to find their original position in
the past, with relation to the CMa shell. We also revise the heating and
ionization of the Sh2-296 nebula, by comparing the photon budget provided by
the O stars in the region with results from radio observations. We find that
the runaway stars have likely been ejected from a Trapezium-like progenitor
cluster on three successive SN explosions having taken place ~6, ~2 and ~1 Myr
ago. We also show that the few late-type O stars in the region cannot explain
the ionization of the Sh~2-296 nebula and other mechanisms need to be at work.
We argue that, though we now have evidence for several SNe events in the CMa
OB1 association, the SNe probably played a minor role in triggering star
formation in these clouds. In contrast, the CMa OB1 association, as it is now,
likely testifies to the last stages of a star-forming region.

$\mathcal{C}$ is semisimple but not necessarily finite or rigid, then
$\bigoplus_{X\in\text{Irr}(\mathcal{C})}X'\boxtimes X$ is a commutative
algebra, with $X'$ a representing object for
$\text{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(\bullet\otimes_\mathcal{C}X,\mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{C}})$.
Conversely, let $A=\bigoplus_{i\in I}U_i\boxtimes V_i$ be a simple commutative
algebra in $\mathcal{U}\boxtimes\mathcal{V}$ with $\mathcal{U}$ semisimple and
rigid but not necessarily finite, and $\mathcal{V}$ rigid but not necessarily

commuting pair in $A$, we show there is a braid-reversed equivalence between
subcategories of $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ sending $U_i$ to $V_i^*$. When

(MBO). The entropy search is successful approach to Bayesian optimization.
However, for MBO, existing entropy-based methods ignore trade-off among
objectives or introduce unreliable approximations. We propose a novel
entropy-based MBO called Pareto-frontier entropy search (PFES) by considering
the entropy of Pareto-frontier, which is an essential notion of the optimality
of the multi-objective problem. Our entropy can incorporate the trade-off
relation of the optimal values, and further, we derive an analytical formula
without introducing additional approximations or simplifications to the
standard entropy search setting. We also show that our entropy computation is
practically feasible by using a recursive decomposition technique which has
been known in studies of the Pareto hyper-volume computation. Besides the usual
MBO setting, in which all the objectives are simultaneously observed, we also
consider the ""decoupled"" setting, in which the objective functions can be
observed separately. PFES can easily adapt to the decoupled setting by
considering the entropy of the marginal density for each output dimension. This
approach incorporates dependency among objectives conditioned on
Pareto-frontier, which is ignored by the existing method. Our numerical
experiments show effectiveness of PFES through several benchmark datasets.

equitably. Though spatial equity has been well-studied under the docked model,
where bikes are picked up and dropped off at prespecified docking stations,
there has been little work examining that of the increasingly popular dockless
model, where bikes can be picked up and dropped off from anywhere within an
operating area. We explore comparative equity in spatial access to bikeshare
services under these two models by collecting spatial data on 45,935 bikes from
73 bikeshare systems using a novel querying approach (with generalizable and

Of
particular interest are wetlands, a type of ecosystem that constitutes the most
effective terrestrial long-term carbon store. As permafrost thaws, the carbon
that was locked in these wetland soils for millennia becomes available for
aerobic and anaerobic decomposition, which releases CO2 and CH4, respectively,
back to the atmosphere.As CO2 and CH4 are potent greenhouse gases, this
transfer of carbon from the land to the atmosphere further contributes to
global warming, thereby increasing the rate of permafrost degradation in a
positive feedback loop. Therefore, monitoring Arctic wetland health and
dynamics is a key scientific task that is also of importance for policy.
However, the identification and delineation of these important wetland
ecosystems, remain incomplete and often inaccurate. Mapping the extent of
Arctic wetlands remains a challenge for the scientific community. Conventional,
coarser remote sensing methods are inadequate at distinguishing the diverse and
micro-topographically complex non-vascular vegetation that characterize Arctic
wetlands, presenting the need for better identification methods. To tackle this
challenging problem, we constructed and annotated the first-of-its-kind Arctic
Wetland Dataset (AWD). Based on that, we present ArcticNet, a deep neural
network that exploits the multi-spectral, high-resolution imagery captured from
nanosatellites (Planet Dove CubeSats) with additional DEM from the ArcticDEM

three Arctic wetland functional types are included. We present multi-fold

provide a preliminary investigation on the Lorentz-violation (LV) induced spin
precession due to the $\vec{\sigma}\cdot\vec{\tilde{b}}(1+gz)$ and
$\bar{b}/m_{_I}\vec{\sigma}\cdot\hat{\vec{p}}$ couplings, where
$\vec{\tilde{b}}$ and $\bar{b}$ represent LV coefficients. The
helicity-dependent couplings can induce unusual phase evolutions with position
and momentum dependence. As $\vec{\tilde{b}}$ varies with time due to the
Earth's motion, the spin polarization also shows a sidereal time dependence,
and it may be enhanced with time for ultra-stable polarized state of neutrons.
The inseparability of the spin-momentum coupling of the $\bar{b}$-term can also
lead to motional dependent polarization state. With the precisely measured
transition frequency between different gravitational bound states, we get a
rough bound $|\vec{\tilde{b}}|<3.9\times10^{-3}$GeV for unpolarized neutrons.
If the spin-flip transition frequency can reach comparable precision in the

nonlinear response of complex soft matter systems, such as networks of
entangled polymers, over wide-ranging spatiotemporal scales. OTM can also
uniquely characterize the microstructural dynamics that lead to the intriguing
nonlinear rheological properties that these systems exhibit. However, the
strain in OTM measurements, applied by optically forcing a micro-probe through
the material, induces network inhomogeneities in and around the strain path,
and the resultant flow field complicates the measured response of the system.
Through a robust set of custom-designed OTM protocols, coupled with modeling
and analytical calculations, we characterize the time-varying inhomogeneity
fields induced by OTM measurements. We show that post-strain homogenization
does not interfere with the intrinsic stress relaxation dynamics of the system,
rather it manifests as an independent component in the stress decay, even in
highly nonlinear regimes such as with the microrheological-LAOS (mLAOS)
protocols we introduce. Our specific results show that Rouse-like elastic
retraction, rather than disentanglement and disengagement, dominates the
nonlinear stress relaxation of entangled polymers at micro- and meso- scales.
Thus, our study opens up possibilities of performing precision nonlinear
microrheological measurements, such as mLAOS, on a wide range of complex
macromolecular systems.

to emerging Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS). Leveled-HE (LHE)-enabled
Convolutional Neural Networks (LHECNNs) are proposed to implement MLaaS to
avoid large bootstrapping overhead. However, prior LHECNNs have to pay
significant computing overhead but achieve only low inference accuracy, due to
their polynomial approximation activations and poolings. Stacking many
polynomial approximation activation layers in a network greatly reduces
inference accuracy, since the polynomial approximation activation errors lead
to a low distortion of the output distribution of the next batch normalization
layer. So the polynomial approximation activations and poolings have become the
obstacle to a fast and accurate LHECNN model.
  In this paper, we propose a Shift-accumulation-based LHE-enabled deep neural
network (SHE) for fast and accurate inferences on encrypted data. We use the
binary-operation-friendly Leveled Fast Homomorphic Encryption over Torus
(LTFHE) encryption scheme to implement ReLU activations and max poolings. We
also adopt the logarithmic quantization to accelerate inferences by replacing
expensive LTFHE multiplications with cheap LTFHE shifts. We propose a mixed
bitwidth accumulator to accelerate accumulations. Since the LTFHE ReLU
activations, max poolings, shifts and accumulations have small multiplicative
depth overhead, SHE can implement much deeper network architectures with more
convolutional and activation layers. Our experimental results show SHE achieves
the state-of-the-art inference accuracy and reduces the inference latency by
76.21% ~ 94.23% over prior LHECNNs on MNIST and CIFAR-10. The source code of

are selected and the analytical expressions for SEWs supported in each

factors are crucial for enhancing SEW thermal conductivity using multilayers.
It is also found that the solution can be extended to various materials and
provide the guidelines on which configurations are desirable for increasing the
thermal conductivity. Furthermore, the analytical solutions reduce the
calculation time significantly such that the optimal configuration, which can
additionally yield SEW thermal conductivity of 1.27 W/m$\cdot$K corresponding

Without extra power from fallback accretion, the light curve is that of a Type
IIP supernova with a plateau magnitude of around -14 mag and a plateau duration
of 40 days. With extra power for the light curve from fallback accretion,
however, we find that the transient can be significantly more luminous. The
light-curve shape can be SN 1987A-like or Type IIP-like, depending on the
efficiency of the fallback engine. If the accretion disk forms soon after the
collapse and more than 1% of the accretion energy is released as the central
engine, fallback accretion powered supernovae become as luminous as
superluminous supernovae. We suggest that Type II superluminous supernovae with
broad hydrogen features could be related to such hydrogen-rich supernovae
powered by fallback accretion. In the future, such superluminous supernovae
powered by fallback accretion might be found among the supernovae from the

modeled, for the first time, with emission from an accretion disk with a
generalized radial temperature profile, in order to account for the intrinsic
spectra which are found to be generally redder than the model prediction of the
standard Shakura-Sunyaev disk (SSD) ($F_\nu\propto\nu^{+1/3}$). The power-law
indices of the radial temperature profile ($T_{\rm eff}(R)\propto R^{-p}$, $R$

median of $0.63$), deviating from the canonical $p=0.75$ for the SSD model as
widely adopted in previous studies. A marginal correlation of a flatter radial
temperature profile (a smaller $p$ value) with increasing the Eddington ratio
is suggested. Such a model produces generally a lower peak of accretion disk
emission and thus a smaller bolometric luminosity in some of the AGN,
particularly those with high Eddington ratios, than that based on the SSD model
by a factor of several. The broadband SED, the bolometric correction factors
and their dependence on some of the AGN parameters are re-visited. We suggest
that such non-standard SSD disks may operate in AGN and are at least partly

the patches which contribute the most to the learning error, and train a
(local) patch model for each such patch; and, 3) update the global model using
training data that do not fall into any patch. To use a PL model, we first
determine if the input falls into any patch. If yes, then the corresponding
patch model is used to compute the output. Otherwise, the global model is used.
We explain in detail how PL can be implemented using fuzzy systems. Five

  Reconstruction","Accepted to IEEE ISBI 2020",,,,"eess.IV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Signal models based on sparsity, low-rank and other properties have been
exploited for image reconstruction from limited and corrupted data in medical
imaging and other computational imaging applications. In particular,
sparsifying transform models have shown promise in various applications, and
offer numerous advantages such as efficiencies in sparse coding and learning.
This work investigates pre-learning a two-layer extension of the transform
model for image reconstruction, wherein the transform domain or filtering
residuals of the image are further sparsified in the second layer. The proposed
block coordinate descent optimization algorithms involve highly efficient
updates. Preliminary numerical experiments demonstrate the usefulness of a
two-layer model over the previous related schemes for CT image reconstruction
from low-dose measurements.

more informed with the existence of ads and tracking domains, but their rate of
change was slower than other blacklists. Our analysis also shows that Alexa top

suggests that ad-blocking blacklists are updated by prioritizing ads and

small-scale ($<150$ ckpc) Ly$\alpha$ radial profiles of LAEs are consistent

LAE and other unknown sources, such as cold-gas streams and galactic outflow.
We find no evolution in the Ly$\alpha$ radial profiles of our LAEs from $z=5.7$

hadrons mixed phase is obtained. Since the hadronic matter is under the
influence of strong force of nucleons, we calculate the equation of state of
this phase using a powerful variational many-body technique. Finally, we
calculate the mass and radius of a cold neutron star with a quark core by
numerically solving the TOV equation. To check our used EOS, we compare our

mechanisms to allocate items to agents when the private preferences over
indivisible items are provided by self-interested agents. The mainstream
mechanism \textit{Random Priority} is asymptotically the best mechanism for
this purpose, when comparing its welfare to the optimal social welfare using
the canonical \textit{worst-case approximation ratio}. Despite its popularity,
the efficiency loss indicated by the worst-case ratio does not have a constant
bound. Recently, [Deng, Gao, Zhang 2017] show that when the agents' preferences
are drawn from a uniform distribution, its \textit{average-case approximation
ratio} is upper bounded by 3.718. They left it as an open question of whether a
constant ratio holds for general scenarios. In this paper, we offer an
affirmative answer to this question by showing that the ratio is bounded by
$1/\mu$ when the preference values are independent and identically distributed
random variables, where $\mu$ is the expectation of the value distribution.
This upper bound also improves the upper bound of 3.718 in [Deng, Gao, Zhang
2017] for the Uniform distribution. Moreover, under mild conditions, the ratio
has a \textit{constant} bound for any independent random values. En route to
these results, we develop powerful tools to show the insights that in most
instances the efficiency loss is small.

emerged as an effective way to acquire the channel of millimeter-wave (mmWave)
systems with a small number of measurements. These techniques, however, are
based on prior knowledge of transmit and receive array manifolds, and assume
perfect antenna arrays at both the transmitter and the receiver. In the
presence of antenna imperfections, the geometry and response of the arrays are
modified. This distorts the CS measurement matrix and results in channel
estimation errors. This paper studies the effects of both transmit and receive
antenna imperfections on the mmWave channel estimate. A relay-aided solution
which corrects for errors caused by faulty transmit arrays is then proposed.
Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution and
show that comparable channel estimates can be obtained when compared to systems
with perfect antennas without the need for additional training overhead.

communication networks (WPCN). In this paper, we exploit non-orthogonal

fairness. Specifically, we sort all users according to their channel conditions
and divide them into two groups, the interference group with high channel gains
and the noninterference group with low channel gains. The power station (PS)
concurrently transmits energy signals with the data transmissions of the users
in the interference group. Thus, the users in the noninterference group can
harvest more energy and achieve a higher throughput, while the users in the
interference group degrade their performance due to the interfering signals
from the PS. We then apply order statistic theory to analyze the achievable
rates of ordered users, based on which all users are appropriately grouped for
NOMA transmission to achieve the max-min fairness of the system. Meanwhile, the
optimal number of interfered users that determines the set of users in each
group, is derived. Our simulation results validate the significant improvement
of both network fairness and throughput via the fairness-aware NOMA-based

other nearby swimmers. Whilst the complex dynamics of lone spermatozoa have
been well-studied, the detailed effects of hydrodynamic interactions between

this study we will attempt to elucidate the pairwise swimming behaviors of

arising from near-field hydrodynamic interactions. Focusing on two

probabilities that clean labels flip into noisy labels, plays a central role in
building \textit{statistically consistent classifiers}. Existing theories have
shown that the transition matrix can be learned by exploiting \textit{anchor
points} (i.e., data points that belong to a specific class almost surely).
However, when there are no anchor points, the transition matrix will be poorly
learned, and those current consistent classifiers will significantly
degenerate. In this paper, without employing anchor points, we propose a
\textit{transition-revision} ($T$-Revision) method to effectively learn
transition matrices, leading to better classifiers. Specifically, to learn a
transition matrix, we first initialize it by exploiting data points that are
similar to anchor points, having high \textit{noisy class posterior
probabilities}. Then, we modify the initialized matrix by adding a
\textit{slack variable}, which can be learned and validated together with the
classifier by using noisy data. Empirical results on benchmark-simulated and
real-world label-noise datasets demonstrate that without using exact anchor
points, the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art label-noise

in multiagent environments poses problems such as nonstationarity and

policy gradient can be prone to poor performance in the presence of even the
most benign nonstationarity. By contrast, it is known that the replicator
dynamics, a well-studied model from evolutionary game theory, eliminates
dominated strategies and exhibits convergence of the time-averaged trajectories
to interior Nash equilibria in zero-sum games. Thus, using the replicator
dynamics as a foundation, we derive an elegant one-line change to policy
gradient methods that simply bypasses the gradient step through the softmax,
yielding a new algorithm titled Neural Replicator Dynamics (NeuRD). NeuRD
reduces to the exponential weights/Hedge algorithm in the single-state
all-actions case. Additionally, NeuRD has formal equivalence to softmax
counterfactual regret minimization, which guarantees convergence in the
sequential tabular case. Importantly, our algorithm provides a straightforward
way of extending the replicator dynamics to the function approximation setting.
Empirical results show that NeuRD quickly adapts to nonstationarities,
outperforming policy gradient significantly in both tabular and function
approximation settings, when evaluated on the standard imperfect information

performance is evaluated by a non-linear function of age of information (AoI)
that is defined as the time elapsed since the generation of the most up-to-date
status information at the receiver. The system is formulated as two queues with
status packet generation and energy arrivals both assumed to be Poisson
processes. With negligible service time, both First-Come-First-Served (FCFS)
and Last-Come-First-Served (LCFS) disciplines for arbitrary buffer and battery
capacities are considered, and a method for calculating the average penalty
with non-linear penalty functions is proposed. The average AoI, the average
penalty under exponential penalty function, and AoI's threshold violation
probability are obtained in closed form. When the service time is assumed to
follow exponential distribution, matrix geometric method is used to obtain the
average peak AoI. The results illustrate that under the FCFS discipline, the
status update frequency needs to be carefully chosen according to the service
rate and energy arrival rate in order to minimize the average penalty.

statistical platforms. The package includes not only classical bandwidth
selection, estimation, and inference methods (Wand and Jones, 1995; Fan and
Gijbels, 1996), but also other recent developments in the statistics and
econometrics literatures such as robust bias-corrected inference and coverage
error optimal bandwidth selection (Calonico, Cattaneo and Farrell, 2018, 2019).
Furthermore, this article also proposes a simple way of estimating optimal
bandwidths in practice that always delivers the optimal mean square error
convergence rate regardless of the specific evaluation point, that is, no
matter whether it is implemented at a boundary or interior point. Numerical
performance is illustrated using an empirical application and simulated data,
where a detailed numerical comparison with other R packages is given.

the underlying signal is of length $L$ and follows a standard factor model with
mean zero and $r$ normally-distributed factors. To recover the covariance
matrix in this case, we propose to employ the second- and fourth-order

recovering the covariance matrix (under a certain technical condition) when
$r<\sqrt{L}$. Correspondingly, we provide a polynomial-time procedure for
estimating the covariance matrix from many (translated and noisy) observations,
where no explicit knowledge of $r$ is required, and prove the procedure's
statistical consistency. While our results establish that covariance estimation
is possible from the power spectrum and the trispectrum for low-rank covariance

of non-reciprocal devices, such as isolators and circulators, over different
parts of the spectrum, for guided waves. On the other hand, very little work
has been performed on non-reciprocal devices for waves propagating in free
space, which can also have many practical applications. For example, it was
shown theoretically that non-reciprocal scattering by a metasurface can be
obtained if the surface-impedance operator is continuously modulated in space
and time. However, the main challenge in the realization of such a metasurface
is due to the high complexity required to modulate in space and time many
sub-wavelength unit-cells of which the metasurface consists. In this paper we
show that spatiotemporally modulated metagratings can lead to strong
nonreciprocal responses, despite the fact that they are based on
electrically-large unit cells. We specifically focus on wire metagratings
loaded with time-modulated capacitances. We use the
discrete-dipole-approximation and an ad-hoc generalization of the theory of
polarizability for time-modulated particles, and demonstrate an effective

semi-supervised mechanism for robust learning which excludes noisy labels but
is still able to learn from the corresponding samples. To this end, we add an
unsupervised loss term that also serves as a regularizer against the remaining
label noise. We evaluate our approach on common classification tasks with
different noise ratios. Our robust models outperform the state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin. Especially for very large noise ratios, we achieve
up to 20 % absolute improvement compared to the previous best model.

interference issues in cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
communications. In this paper, we propose a new base station (BS) cooperative
beamforming (CB) technique for the cellular downlink to mitigate the strong
interference caused by the co-channel terrestrial transmissions to the UAV.
Besides the conventional CB by cooperatively transmitting the UAV's message,
the serving BSs of the UAVs exploit a novel interference transmission scheme to
effectively suppress the terrestrial interference to the UAV. Specifically, the
co-channel terrestrial users' messages are shared with the UAV's serving BSs
and transmitted via CB to cancel their resultant interference at the UAV. To
balance between the CB gains for UAV signal enhancement and interference
cancellation, we aim to maximize the UAV's receive
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio by jointly optimizing the power
allocations at all of its serving BSs for transmitting the UAV's and co-channel
terrestrial users' messages. First, we derive the closed-form optimal solution
to this problem in a special case and draw useful insights. Then, we propose an
algorithm to solve the problem optimally in the general case. As the optimal
solution requires centralized implementation with exorbitant message/channel
information exchanges among the BSs, we further propose a distributed algorithm
that is amenable to practical implementation, based on a new divide-and-conquer
approach, whereby each co-channel BS divides its perceived interference to the
UAV into multiple portions, each to be canceled by a different serving BS of
the UAV with its best effort. Numerical results show that the proposed
centralized and distributed CB schemes with interference transmission and
cancellation (ITC) can both significantly outperform the conventional CB
without applying ITC.

scheduling so as to minimize downtimes and to efficiently utilize limited
resources. In doing so, datacenter operators employ streaming analytics for
collecting and processing datacenter telemetry over a temporal window. The
quantile operator is key to these systems as it can summarize the typical and
abnormal behavior of the monitored system. Computing quantiles in real-time is
resource-intensive as it requires processing hundreds of millions of events in
seconds while providing high accuracy.
  We overcome these challenges in real-time quantile computation through
workload-driven approximation, motivated by three insights in our study: (i)
values are dominated by a set of recurring small values, (ii) distribution of
small values is consistent across different time scales, and (iii) tail values
are dominated by a small set of large values. That is, we propose AOMG, an
efficient and accurate quantile approximation algorithm that capitalizes on
these insights. AOMG minimizes memory footprint of the quantile operator via
compression and frequency-based summarization of small values. While these
summaries are stored and processed at sub-window granularity for memory
efficiency, they can extend to compute quantiles on user-defined temporal
windows. Low value error for tail quantiles is achieved by retaining a few tail
values per subwindow. AOMG estimates quantiles with high throughput and less
than 5% relative value error across a wide range of use cases while
state-of-the-art algorithms either have a high relative value error
(9.3-137.0%) or deliver lower throughput (15-92%).

probabilistic inference involving multi-modal distributions is very difficult

improves Hamiltonian dynamics to reduce the autocorrelation of the samples and
uses a variational distribution to explore the phase space and find new modes.
A formal proof is provided which shows that the proposed method can converge to

applying disentangling methods to hierarchical VAEs. The resulting models

Prismatic concrete specimens with different reinforcement configurations were

specimens is modeled with a tailor-designed bond modeling approach for rigorous

design} these cycles for stability of switched linear systems. We employ
properties of the subsystem matrices and mild assumption on the admissible
switches between the subsystems {for this purpose}. In contrast to prior works,
{our construction of} stabilizing cycles does not involve design of
Lyapunov-like functions and storage of sets of scalars in memory prior to the
application of a cycle detection algorithm. As a result, {the} techniques
{proposed in this paper} offer improved numerical tractability.

low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening has been shown to significantly
reduce mortality but suffers from a high false positive rate that leads to
unnecessary diagnostic procedures. Quantitative image analysis coupled to deep
learning techniques has the potential to reduce this false positive rate. We
conducted a computational analysis of 1449 low-dose CT studies drawn from the
National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) cohort. We applied to this cohort our
newly developed algorithm, DeepScreener, which is based on a novel deep
learning approach. The algorithm, after the training process using about 3000
CT studies, does not require lung nodule annotations to conduct cancer
prediction. The algorithm uses consecutive slices and multi-task features to
determine whether a nodule is likely to be cancer, and a spatial pyramid to
detect nodules at different scales. We find that the algorithm can predict a
patient's cancer status from a volumetric lung CT image with high accuracy
(78.2%, with area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) of
0.858). Our preliminary framework ranked 16th of 1972 teams (top 1%) in the
Data Science Bowl 2017 (DSB2017) competition, based on the challenge datasets.
We report here the application of DeepScreener on an independent NLST test set.
This study indicates that the deep learning approach has the potential to
significantly reduce the false positive rate in lung cancer screening with
low-dose CT scans.

  IJCAI-19",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study a network formation game where agents receive benefits by forming
connections to other agents but also incur both direct and indirect costs from
the formed connections. Specifically, once the agents have purchased their
connections, an attack starts at a randomly chosen vertex in the network and
spreads according to the independent cascade model with a fixed probability,
destroying any infected agents. The utility or welfare of an agent in our game
is defined to be the expected size of the agent's connected component
post-attack minus her expenditure in forming connections.
  Our goal is to understand the properties of the equilibrium networks formed
in this game. Our first result concerns the edge density of equilibrium
networks. A network connection increases both the likelihood of remaining
connected to other agents after an attack as well the likelihood of getting
infected by a cascading spread of infection. We show that the latter concern
primarily prevails and any equilibrium network in our game contains only
$O(n\log n)$ edges where $n$ denotes the number of agents. On the other hand,
there are equilibrium networks that contain $\Omega(n)$ edges showing that our
edge density bound is tight up to a logarithmic factor. Our second result shows
that the presence of attack and its spread through a cascade does not
significantly lower social welfare as long as the network is not too dense. We
show that any non-trivial equilibrium network with $O(n)$ edges has
$\Theta(n^2)$ social welfare, asymptotically similar to the social welfare
guarantee in the game without any attacks.

cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with different BH seeding scenarios.
Employing the constrained Gaussian realization, we reconstruct the initial
conditions in the large-volume BlueTides simulation and run them to $z=6$ to
cross-validate that the method reproduces the first quasars and their
environments. Our constrained simulations in a volume of $(15\, h^{-1}{\rm
Mpc})^3$ successfully recover the evolution of large-scale structure and the
stellar and BH masses in the vicinity of a $\sim10^{12}\, M_{\odot}$ halo which
we identified in BlueTides at $z\sim7$ hosting a $\sim10^9\, M_{\odot}$ SMBH.
Among our constrained simulations, only the ones with a low-tidal field and
high-density peak in the initial conditions induce the fastest BH growth
required to explain the $z>6$ quasars. We run two sets of simulations with
different BH seed masses of $5\times10^3$, $5\times10^4$, and $5\times10^5\,
h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, (a) with the same ratio of halo to BH seed mass and (b) with
the same halo threshold mass. At $z=6$, all the SMBHs converge in mass to
$\sim10^9\, M_{\odot}$ except for the one with the smallest seed in (b)
undergoing critical BH growth and reaching $10^8$ -- $10^9\, M_{\odot}$, albeit
with most of the growth in (b) delayed compared to set (a). The finding of
eight BH mergers in the small-seed scenario (four with masses $10^4$ -- $10^6\,
M_{\odot}$ at $z>12$), six in the intermediate-seed scenario, and zero in the
large-seed scenario suggests that the vast BHs in the small-seed scenario merge
frequently during the early phases of the growth of SMBHs. The increased BH
merger rate for the low-mass BH seed and halo threshold scenario provides an
exciting prospect for discriminating BH formation mechanisms with the advent of
multi-messenger astrophysics and next-generation gravitational wave facilities.

present each multimedia item with a key frame image (e.g., the poster of a
movie). As each multimedia item can be represented as multiple fine-grained
visual images (e.g., related images of the movie), personalized key frame
recommendation is necessary in these applications to attract users' unique
visual preferences. However, previous personalized key frame recommendation
models relied on users' fine-grained image behavior of multimedia items (e.g.,
user-image interaction behavior), which is often not available in real
scenarios. In this paper, we study the general problem of joint multimedia item
and key frame recommendation in the absence of the fine-grained user-image
behavior. We argue that the key challenge of this problem lies in discovering
users' visual profiles for key frame recommendation, as most recommendation
models would fail without any users' fine-grained image behavior. To tackle
this challenge, we leverage users' item behavior by projecting users (items) in
two latent spaces: a collaborative latent space and a visual latent space. We
further design a model to discern both the collaborative and visual dimensions
of users, and model how users make decisive item preferences from these two
spaces. As a result, the learned user visual profiles could be directly applied
for key frame recommendation. Finally, experimental results on a real-world
dataset clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model on the two
recommendation tasks.

three projected nested-gradient methods that are guaranteed to converge to the

investigate the so-called Snowball Earth transition. For certain values of the
solar constant, the climate system allows two different stable states: one of
them is the Snowball Earth, covered by ice and snow, and the other one is
today's climate. In our setup, we consider the case when the climate system
starts from its warm attractor (the stable climate we experience today), and
the solar constant is decreased continuously in finite time, according to a
parameter drift scenario, to a state, where only the Snowball Earth's attractor
remains stable. This induces an inevitable transition, or climate tipping from
the warm climate. The reverse transition is also discussed. Increasing the
solar constant back to its original value on individual simulations, we find
that the system stays stuck in the Snowball state. However, using ensemble
methods i.e., using an ensemble of climate realizations differing only slightly
in their initial conditions we show that the transition from the Snowball Earth
to the warm climate is also possible with a certain probability. From the point
of view of dynamical systems theory, we can say that the system's snapshot
attractor splits between the warm climate's and the Snowball Earth's attractor.

have no specific polarization, that is, there are standing waves localized in
the scattering structure whose wave numbers lies in the first open diffraction
channels for both longitudinal and transverse modes. BSCs are shown to exists
only for specific distances between the arrays and for specific values of the
wave vector component along the array. An analytic solution is obtained for
such BSCs. For distances between the parallel arrays much larger than the
wavelength, BSCs is proved to exist due to destructive interference of the far
field resonance radiation, similar to the interference in a Fabry-Perot
interferometer, that can occur simultaneously for both propagating modes.

stationary state solutions show that the different number of nodes and crests
formed in the density profile (as a function of r and z) for different
combinations of radial (n) and axial (nz) quantum numbers at a fixed azimuthal
quantum number l=2, give rise to different structure around the 3D ring vortex
centered at r=0. We have considered both spontaneous and induced decays and
compared the results with those without considering the decays. The out of
phase oscillation of atomic and molecular numbers in two vortex states both in
presence and absence of external decays is the signature of coherence due to
the atom-molecular coupling. This coherence is also implemented in the
evolution of coupled atomic and molecular vortices. Intensity of molecular ring
vortices grows with progress in time in expense of that of atomic ring vortices
and vice versa. It is found that the intensity of the coupled atomic and
molecular ring vortices starts oscillation out of phase during evolution.
Dependence of the atom-molecular conversion efficiency and the lifetime of the
system on the laser intensity of photoassociation lasers and the total number
of atoms in two different vortex states reveals that formation of
atom-molecular coupled vortices and the efficiency of formation can be
controlled by varying these parameters. Linear stability analysis of vortex
states as a function of different system parameters shows that the atomic
vortices are more stable than molecular vortices.

directly regularizing a black-box model for interpretability at training time.
Our approach explicitly connects three key aspects of interpretable machine
learning: (i) the model's innate explainability, (ii) the explanation system
used at test time, and (iii) the metrics that measure explanation quality. Our
regularization results in substantial improvement in terms of the explanation
fidelity and stability metrics across a range of datasets and black-box
explanation systems while slightly improving accuracy. Further, if the
resulting model is still not sufficiently interpretable, the weight of the
regularization term can be adjusted to achieve the desired trade-off between
accuracy and interpretability. Finally, we justify theoretically that the
benefits of explanation-based regularization generalize to unseen points.

incorporates the dynamics of both liquid and solid phases with moving interface

from $\widetilde{O}(n^2\varepsilon^{-3})$ to
$\widetilde{O}(n^2\varepsilon^{-2})$. Notably, our result can match the best
known complexity bound of Sinkhorn and help clarify why Greenkhorn
significantly outperforms Sinkhorn in practice in terms of row/column updates

adaptive primal-dual accelerated gradient descent (APDAGD)
algorithm~\citep{Dvurechensky-2018-Computational} with a prespecified mirror
mapping $\phi$. We prove that APDAMD achieves the complexity bound of
$\widetilde{O}(n^2\sqrt{\delta}\varepsilon^{-1})$ in which $\delta>0$ stands
for the regularity of $\phi$. In addition, we show by a counterexample that the
complexity bound of $\widetilde{O}(\min\{n^{9/4}\varepsilon^{-1},
n^2\varepsilon^{-2}\})$ proved for APDAGD before is invalid and give a refined
complexity bound of $\widetilde{O}(n^{5/2}\varepsilon^{-1})$. Further, we
develop a \textit{deterministic} accelerated variant of Sinkhorn via appeal to

$\widetilde{O}(n^{7/3}\varepsilon^{-4/3})$. As such, we see that accelerated
variant of Sinkhorn outperforms Sinkhorn and Greenkhorn in terms of
$1/\varepsilon$ and APDAGD and accelerated alternating minimization
(AAM)~\citep{Guminov-2021-Combination} in terms of $n$. Finally, we conduct the
experiments on synthetic and real data and the numerical results show the
efficiency of Greenkhorn, APDAMD and accelerated Sinkhorn in practice.

deep learning (DL) enables models to extract interpretable features from

many tasks in medical domains inherently consist of small sample data with
lengthy documents; for a kidney transplant as an example, data from only a few

couple of millions of words in major hospitals. Thus, complex DL methods cannot

including identity, duplication, teleportation, simulation, self-location, and

unnecessary convictions of physicalism: the assumption that brain states and
their corresponding conscious states can in principle be copied. In this paper
I will argue against this assumption by attempting to prove the Unique History
Theorem, which states, essentially, that conscious correlations to underlying
quantum mechanical measurement events must increase with time and that every
conscious state uniquely determines its history from an earlier conscious
state. By assuming only that consciousness arises from an underlying physical
state, I will argue that the physical evolution from a first physical state
giving rise to a conscious state to a second physical state giving rise to a
later conscious state is unique. Among the consequences of this theorem are
that: consciousness is not algorithmic and a conscious state cannot be uploaded
to or simulated by a digital computer; a conscious state cannot be copied by
duplicating a brain or any other physical state; and a conscious state cannot
be repeated or created de novo. These conclusions shed light on the physical
nature of consciousness by rendering moot a variety of seemingly paradoxical

  Analysis","CAV 2019",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stochastic model checking is a technique for analyzing systems that possess
probabilistic characteristics. However, its scalability is limited as
probabilistic models of real-world applications typically have very large or
infinite state space. This paper presents a new infinite state CTMC model
checker, STAMINA, with improved scalability. It uses a novel state space
approximation method to reduce large and possibly infinite state CTMC models to
finite state representations that are amenable to existing stochastic model
checkers. It is integrated with a new property-guided state expansion approach
that improves the analysis accuracy. Demonstration of the tool on several
benchmark examples shows promising results in terms of analysis efficiency and
accuracy compared with a state-of-the-art CTMC model checker that deploys a
similar approximation method.

  note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1905.12991",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose DAB -- a data-aware extension of BPMN where the process operates
over case and persistent data (partitioned into a read-only database called
catalog and a read-write database called repository). The model trades off
between expressiveness and the possibility of supporting parameterized
verification of safety properties on top of it. Specifically, taking
inspiration from the literature on verification of artifact systems, we study
verification problems where safety properties are checked irrespectively of the
content of the read-only catalog, and accepting the potential presence of
unboundedly many tuples in the catalog and repository. We tackle such problems
using an array-based backward reachability procedure fully implemented in MCMT
-- a state-of-the-art array-based SMT model checker. Notably, we prove that the
procedure is sound and complete for checking safety of DABs, and single out
additional conditions that guarantee its termination and, in turn, show
decidability of checking safety.

  International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems, 2019",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Developing high performance embedded vision applications requires balancing
run-time performance with energy constraints. Given the mix of hardware
accelerators that exist for embedded computer vision (e.g. multi-core CPUs,
GPUs, and FPGAs), and their associated vendor optimized vision libraries, it
becomes a challenge for developers to navigate this fragmented solution space.
To aid with determining which embedded platform is most suitable for their
application, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of the run-time performance
and energy efficiency of a wide range of vision kernels. We discuss rationales
for why a given underlying hardware architecture innately performs well or
poorly based on the characteristics of a range of vision kernel categories.
Specifically, our study is performed for three commonly used HW accelerators
for embedded vision applications: ARM57 CPU, Jetson TX2 GPU and ZCU102 FPGA,
using their vendor optimized vision libraries: OpenCV, VisionWorks and
xfOpenCV. Our results show that the GPU achieves an energy/frame reduction
ratio of 1.1-3.2x compared to the others for simple kernels. While for more
complicated kernels and complete vision pipelines, the FPGA outperforms the
others with energy/frame reduction ratios of 1.2-22.3x. It is also observed
that the FPGA performs increasingly better as a vision application's pipeline
complexity grows.

We propose an instance-based deep metric learning approach in joint visual and
textual space. The key novelty of this paper is that it shows that using
per-image semantic supervision leads to substantial improvement in zero-shot
performance over using class-only supervision. On top of that, we provide a
probabilistic justification for a metric rescaling approach that solves a very
common problem in the generalized zero-shot learning setting, i.e., classifying
test images from unseen classes as one of the classes seen during training. We
evaluate our approach on two fine-grained zero-shot learning datasets: CUB and
FLOWERS. We find that on the generalized zero-shot classification task CLAREL
consistently outperforms the existing approaches on both datasets.

  II: Performance Analysis","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1905.08750",,,,"cs.MA eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Part I of this paper considered optimization problems over networks where
agents have individual objectives to meet, or individual parameter vectors to
estimate, subject to subspace constraints that require the objectives across
the network to lie in low-dimensional subspaces. Starting from the centralized
projected gradient descent, an iterative and distributed solution was proposed
that responds to streaming data and employs stochastic approximations in place
of actual gradient vectors, which are generally unavailable. We examined the
second-order stability of the learning algorithm and we showed that, for small
step-sizes $\mu$, the proposed strategy leads to small estimation errors on the
order of $\mu$. This Part II examines steady-state performance. The results
reveal explicitly the influence of the gradient noise, data characteristics,
and subspace constraints, on the network performance. The results also show
that in the small step-size regime, the iterates generated by the distributed
algorithm achieve the centralized steady-state performance.
