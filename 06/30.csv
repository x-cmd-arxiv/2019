regions with a spectrum covering a wide range of frequencies. Within this
spectrum gamma oscillations have received particular attention due to their
ubiquitous nature and to their correlation with higher brain functions.
Recently, it has been reported that gamma oscillations in the hippocampus of
behaving rodents are segregated in two distinct frequency bands: slow and fast.
These two gamma rhythms correspond to dfferent states of the network, but their
origin has been not yet clarified. Here, we show theoretically and numerically
that a single inhibitory population can give rise to coexisting slow and fast
gamma rhythms corresponding to collective oscillations of a balanced spiking
network. The slow and fast gamma rhythms are generated via two different
mechanisms: the fast one being driven by the coordinated tonic neural firing
and the slow one by endogenous fluctuations due to irregular neural activity.
We show that almost instantaneous stimulations can switch the collective gamma
oscillations from slow to fast and vice versa. Furthermore, to make a closer
contact with the experimental observations, we consider the modulation of the
gamma rhythms induced by a slower (theta) rhythm driving the network dynamics.
In this context, depending on the strength of the forcing, we observe
phase-amplitude and phase-phase coupling between the fast and slow gamma
oscillations and the theta forcing. Phase-phase coupling reveals different
theta-phases preferences for the two coexisting gamma rhythms.

guarantees that a compromise in the secrecy of a long-term private-key does not
compromise the secrecy of past session keys. With a growing awareness of
long-term mass surveillance programs by governments and others, FS has become
widely regarded as a highly desirable property. This is particularly true in
the TLS protocol, which is used to secure Internet communication. In this
paper, we investigate FS in pre-TLS 1.3 protocols, which do not mandate FS, but
still widely used today. We conduct an empirical analysis of over 10 million
TLS servers from three different datasets using a novel heuristic approach.
Using a modern TLS client handshake algorithms, our results show 5.37% of top
domains, 7.51% of random domains, and 26.16% of random IPs do not select FS
key-exchange algorithms. Surprisingly, 39.20% of the top domains, 24.40% of the
random domains, and 14.46% of the random IPs that do not select FS, do support
FS. In light of this analysis, we discuss possible paths toward forward secure
Internet traffic. As an improvement of the current state, we propose a new
client-side mechanism that we call ""Best Effort Forward Secrecy"" (BEFS), and an
extension of it that we call ""Best Effort Forward Secrecy and Authenticated
Encryption"" (BESAFE), which aims to guide (force) misconfigured servers to FS
using a best effort approach. Finally, within our analysis, we introduce a
novel adversarial model that we call ""discriminatory"" adversary, which is
applicable to the TLS protocol.

construction and feature representation. Existing evaluation efforts have
mainly been paid on the LRF or the overall descriptor, yet the quantitative
comparison of feature representations remains unexplored. This paper fills this
gap by comprehensively evaluating nine state-of-the-art local geometric feature
representations. Our evaluation is on the ground that ground-truth LRFs are
leveraged such that the ranking of tested feature representations are more
convincing as opposed to existing studies. The experiments are deployed on six
standard datasets with various application scenarios (shape retrieval, point
cloud registration, and object recognition) and data modalities (LiDAR, Kinect,

data decimation, clutter, occlusion, and limited overlap. The evaluated terms
cover the major concerns for a feature representation, e.g., distinctiveness,
robustness, compactness, and efficiency. The outcomes present interesting
findings that may shed new light on this community and provide complementary
perspectives to existing evaluations on the topic of local geometric feature
description. A summary of evaluated methods regarding their peculiarities is
also presented to guide real-world applications and new descriptor crafting.

problem with Transformer [1]. Although impressed by its performance in our
preliminary study, we found its two major weaknesses: (1) locality-agnostics:
the point-wise dot-product self-attention in canonical Transformer architecture
is insensitive to local context, which can make the model prone to anomalies in
time series; (2) memory bottleneck: space complexity of canonical Transformer
grows quadratically with sequence length $L$, making directly modeling long
time series infeasible. In order to solve these two issues, we first propose
convolutional self-attention by producing queries and keys with causal
convolution so that local context can be better incorporated into attention
mechanism. Then, we propose LogSparse Transformer with only $O(L(\log L)^{2})$
memory cost, improving forecasting accuracy for time series with fine
granularity and strong long-term dependencies under constrained memory budget.
Our experiments on both synthetic data and real-world datasets show that it
compares favorably to the state-of-the-art.

first-approximation models by considering long-term biodegradation kinetics for
18 relevant hydrocarbons from three different oil sands operations, lag times,
nutrient limitations, and microbial growth and death rates. Laboratory
measurements were used to estimate model parameter values and to validate the

predicted CH4 production well; normalized mean square error analysis revealed

within-host and epidemic dynamics. In this paper, we design a model to describe
host-parasite dynamics of the well-studied guppy-Gyrodactylus turnbulli system,
using experimental data to estimate parameters and validate it. We estimate the
basic reproduction number (R_0), for this system. Sensitivity analysis reveals
that parasite growth rate, and the rate at which the guppy mounts an immune
response have the greatest impact on outbreak peak and timing both for initial
outbreaks and on longer time scales. These findings highlight guppy population
resistance and parasite virulence as key factors in disease control, and future
work should focus on incorporating heterogeneity in host resistance into
disease models and extrapolating to other host-parasite systems.

however inhomogeneities such as galaxies, stars, planets and ourselves. In the
context of hot Big-Bang cosmology, these inhomogeneities are often explained as
the remains of quantum fluctuations at very early times, enlarged to observable
scales through the process of inflation. In this dissertation, I examine two
important questions surrounding this scenario: a) How do inherently quantal
fluctuations transition to the observed inhomogeneities, which behave
classically? ; and b) If the initial state of the universe was symmetric, how
can the currently observed state? This dissertation is organized in three
parts. Part one first introduces the slow-roll inflation model and then
discusses the behavior of small (scalar) perturbations to this model. The
second part investigates various answers provided to the questions above,
starting with some general observations on the classical limit of quantum
mechanics with special attention given to the inverted harmonic oscillator. The
formalisms of `squeezing' and decoherence are discussed and weak points are
pointed out. In the final part, I examine in detail the pilot-wave approach to
the problem, discussing in detail the classical limit of the theory and how
pilot-wave theory addresses both questions above. Numerical results for
pilot-wave trajectories are presented, illustrating directly the classical

Here, we propose to use superconducting nanowires as a platform for the

for Josephson junctions, we rely on the intrinsic nonlinearity of two coupled

simulations to demonstrate that the nanowire neuron reproduces multiple
characteristics of biological neurons. Furthermore, by harnessing the
nonlinearity of the superconducting nanowire's inductance, we develop a design
for a variable inductive synapse capable of both excitatory and inhibitory

architectures, and that the nanowire neuron's nominal energy performance is
competitive with that of current technologies.

This paper addresses these challenges by developing an example heterogeneous

observe that several real-life workloads can be broken down into common

direct consequence of our certifying algorithms is a linear time algorithm
certifying the presence/absence of an induced claw $(K_{1,3})$ in a chordal

  For the intersection graphs of NC paths of a tree, we characterize the
minimum connected dominating sets (leading to a linear time algorithm to
compute one). We further observe that there is always an independent dominating
set which is a minimum dominating set, leading to the dominating set problem
being solvable in linear time. Finally, each such graph $G$ is shown to have a
Hamiltonian cycle if and only if it is 2-connected, and when $G$ is not

diagnosis and treatment. CT images are often corrupted by undesirable artifacts
when metallic implants are carried by patients, which creates the problem of
metal artifact reduction (MAR). Existing methods for reducing the artifacts due
to metallic implants are inadequate for two main reasons. First, metal
artifacts are structured and non-local so that simple image domain enhancement
approaches would not suffice. Second, the MAR approaches which attempt to
reduce metal artifacts in the X-ray projection (sinogram) domain inevitably
lead to severe secondary artifact due to sinogram inconsistency. To overcome
these difficulties, we propose an end-to-end trainable Dual Domain Network
(DuDoNet) to simultaneously restore sinogram consistency and enhance CT images.
The linkage between the sigogram and image domains is a novel Radon inversion
layer that allows the gradients to back-propagate from the image domain to the
sinogram domain during training. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves significant improvements over other single domain MAR approaches. To
the best of our knowledge, it is the first end-to-end dual-domain network for
MAR.

  (CVPR), 2019",,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Real-world applications of object recognition often require the solution of
multiple tasks in a single platform. Under the standard paradigm of network
fine-tuning, an entirely new CNN is learned per task, and the final network
size is independent of task complexity. This is wasteful, since simple tasks
require smaller networks than more complex tasks, and limits the number of
tasks that can be solved simultaneously. To address these problems, we propose
a transfer learning procedure, denoted NetTailor, in which layers of a
pre-trained CNN are used as universal blocks that can be combined with small
task-specific layers to generate new networks. Besides minimizing
classification error, the new network is trained to mimic the internal
activations of a strong unconstrained CNN, and minimize its complexity by the
combination of 1) a soft-attention mechanism over blocks and 2) complexity
regularization constraints. In this way, NetTailor can adapt the network
architecture, not just its weights, to the target task. Experiments show that
networks adapted to simple tasks, such as character or traffic sign
recognition, become significantly smaller than those adapted to hard tasks,
such as fine-grained recognition. More importantly, due to the modular nature
of the procedure, this reduction in network complexity is achieved without
compromise of either parameter sharing across tasks, or classification
accuracy.

those leagues real-time processing and low-computational complexity is crucial.
However, ROS 2 now offers built-in support for real-time processing and

crossbars for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Resistive crossbars
offer a highly-parallel and efficient matrix-vector-multiplication (MVM)
operation. MVM being the most dominant operation in DNNs makes crossbars
ideally suited. However, various sources of device and circuit non-idealities
lead to errors in the MVM output, thereby reducing DNN accuracy. Towards that
end, we propose crossbar re-mapping strategies to mitigate line-resistance
induced accuracy degradation in DNNs, without having to re-train the learned
weights, unlike most prior works. Line-resistances degrade the voltage levels
along the crossbar columns, thereby inducing more errors at the columns away
from the drivers. We rank the DNN weights and kernels based on a sensitivity
analysis, and re-arrange the columns such that the most sensitive kernels are
mapped closer to the drivers, thereby minimizing the impact of errors on the
overall accuracy. We propose two algorithms $-$ static remapping strategy (SRS)
and dynamic remapping strategy (DRS), to optimize the crossbar re-arrangement
of a pre-trained DNN. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on a standard
VGG16 network trained using CIFAR10 dataset. Our results show that SRS and DRS
limit the accuracy degradation to 2.9\% and 2.1\%, respectively, compared to a
5.6\% drop from an as it is mapping of weights and kernels to crossbars. We
believe this work brings an additional aspect for optimization, which can be
used in tandem with existing mitigation techniques, such as in-situ
compensation, technology aware training and re-training approaches, to enhance
system performance.

metal artifact reduction is to replace the X-ray projection data within the

secondary artifacts are often introduced. In this work, we propose to replace
metal artifact affected regions with anatomically consistent content through
joint projection-sinogram correction as well as adversarial learning. To handle
the metallic implants of diverse shapes and large sizes, we also propose a
novel mask pyramid network that enforces the mask information across the

between data points. The choice of distance metric has a fundamental impact on
performance of these procedures, raising questions about how to appropriately
calculate distances. When data points are real-valued vectors, by far the most
common choice is the Euclidean distance. This article is focused on the problem
of how to better calculate distances taking into account the intrinsic geometry
of the data, assuming data are concentrated near an unknown subspace or
manifold. The appropriate geometric distance corresponds to the length of the
shortest path along the manifold, which is the geodesic distance. When the
manifold is unknown, it is challenging to accurately approximate the geodesic
distance. Current algorithms are either highly complex, and hence often
impractical to implement, or based on simple local linear approximations and
shortest path algorithms that may have inadequate accuracy. We propose a simple
and general alternative, which uses pieces of spheres, or spherelets, to
locally approximate the unknown subspace and thereby estimate the geodesic
distance through paths over spheres. Theory is developed showing lower error
for many manifolds, with applications in clustering, conditional density
estimation and mean regression. The conclusion is supported through multiple
simulation examples and real data sets.

proactive DAA that works by collecting hash rate commitments secured by bond
from miners. The difficulty is set directly from the commitments and the bond
is used to penalize miners who deviate from their commitment. We devise a

only on-blockchain data. The test is sensitive enough to detect a variety of
deviations from commitments, while almost never misclassifying honest miners.
We demonstrate in simulation that, under reasonable assumptions, Bonded Mining
is more effective at maintaining a target block time than the Bitcoin Cash DAA,

  1. All the aforementioned isomorphism problems are equivalent under
polynomial-time reductions, in conjunction with the recent results of
Futorny-Grochow-Sergeichuk (Lin. Alg. Appl., 2019).
  2. Isomorphism of $d$-tensors reduces to isomorphism of 3-tensors, for any $d

  Our results suggest that these isomorphism problems form a rich and robust

We then leverage the techniques used in the above results to prove two
first-of-their-kind results for Group Isomorphism (GpI):
  3. We give a reduction from GpI for $p$-groups of exponent $p$ and small
class ($c < p$) to GpI for $p$-groups of exponent $p$ and class 2. The latter
are widely believed to be the hardest cases of GpI, but as far as we know, this

  4. We give a search-to-decision reduction for isomorphism of $p$-groups of
exponent $p$ and class 2 in time $|G|^{O(\log \log |G|)}$. While
search-to-decision reductions for Graph Isomorphism (GI) have been known for
more than 40 years, as far as we know this is the first non-trivial
search-to-decision reduction in the context of GpI.
  Our main technique for (1), (3), and (4) is a linear-algebraic analogue of
the classical graph coloring gadget, which was used to obtain the

computation. This process requires logical operators, acting on protected
qubits, to be translated into physical operators (circuits) acting on physical
quantum states. We propose a mathematical framework for synthesizing physical
circuits that implement logical Clifford operators for stabilizer codes.
Circuit synthesis is enabled by representing the desired physical Clifford
operator in $\mathbb{C}^{N \times N}$ as a partial $2m \times 2m$ binary
symplectic matrix, where $N = 2^m$. We state and prove two theorems that use
symplectic transvections to efficiently enumerate all binary symplectic
matrices that satisfy a system of linear equations. As a corollary of these
results, we prove that for an $[\![ m,k ]\!]$ stabilizer code every logical
Clifford operator has $2^{r(r+1)/2}$ symplectic solutions, where $r = m-k$, up
to stabilizer degeneracy. The desired physical circuits are then obtained by
decomposing each solution into a product of elementary symplectic matrices,
that correspond to elementary circuits. This enumeration of all physical
realizations enables optimization over the ensemble with respect to a suitable
metric. Furthermore, we show that any circuit that normalizes the stabilizer of
the code can be transformed into a circuit that centralizes the stabilizer,
while realizing the same logical operation. Our method of circuit synthesis can
be applied to any stabilizer code, and this paper discusses a proof of concept
synthesis for the $[\![ 6,4,2 ]\!]$ CSS code. Programs implementing the
algorithms in this paper, which includes routines to solve for binary
symplectic solutions of general linear systems and our overall LCS (logical

ranging from stray light reduction to energy conversion. We demonstrate a
large-area (centimeter-scale) metamaterial that features near-unity

metamaterial comprises a self-assembled porous structure known as an inverse
opal, here made of silica. The structure's large volume fraction of voids,
together with the vibrational resonances of silica in the mid-infrared spectral
range, reduce the metamaterial's refractive index to close to that of air and
introduce considerable optical absorption. As a result, the frequency-selective
structure efficiently absorbs incident light of both polarizations even at very
oblique incidence angles. The absorber remains stable at high temperatures
(measured up to ~900 degrees C), enabling its operation as a
frequency-selective thermal emitter. The excellent performance of this
absorber/emitter and ease of fabrication make it a promising surface coating
for passive radiative cooling, laser safety, and other large-area applications.

the supermassive black hole (SMBH). Considering four tracers of the velocity of
the broad-line regions (BLRs), i.e., the H$\beta$ line width or line dispersion
from the mean or rms spectrum, there are four kinds of the factor $f$. Using
the \hb Full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) to trace the BLRs velocity, we find
significant correlations between the factor $f$ and some observational
parameters, e.g., FWHM, the line dispersion. Using the line dispersion to trace
the BLRs velocity, these relations disappear or become weaker. It implies the
effect of inclination in BLRs geometry. It also suggests that the variable $f$
in $M_{\rm BH}$ estimated from luminosity and FWHM in a single-epoch spectrum
is not negligible. Using a simple model of thick-disk BLRs, we also find that,
as the tracer of the BLRs velocity, H$\beta$ FWHM has some dependence on the
inclination, while the line dispersion $\sigma_{\rm H\beta }$ is insensitive to
the inclination. Considering the calibrated FWHM-based factor $f$ from the mean
spectrum, the scatter of the SMBH mass is 0.39 dex for our sample of 34 low
redshift RM AGNs. For a high redshift sample of 30 SDSS RM AGNs with measured
stellar velocity dispersions, we find that the SMBH mass scatter is larger than
that for our sample of 34 low redshift RM AGNs. It implies the possibility of
evolution of the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_*$ relation from high-redshift to
low-redshift AGNs.

Therefore, we modify the notion of regret by comparing the agent against a

satisfies the budget constraint proportionally over any window of length $W$.
We propose the Online Saddle Point Hybrid Gradient (OSPHG) algorithm to solve

  In this study we present lower bounds and upper bounds for randomized

Moreover, we incorporate a natural waiting scheme into the randomized

against a \emph{fair} adversary, i.e. an adversary with restricted power that
requires the salesman to move within the convex hull of the origin and the
requests released so far. The randomized non-zealous algorithm can outperform
the optimal deterministic algorithm against the fair adversary as well.

coupled, fully gapped superconducting state in this homogeneity range with a
maximum bulk $T_{\rm c}$ of 1.58 K at $x$ = 0.46, though the electronic
specific heat and Hall coefficients remain nearly $x$-independent. The
nonmonotonic dependence of the bulk $T_{\rm c}$ is discussed in relation to the
effects of Sb-layer intercalation between the [Sn$_{4}$Sb$_{3}$] seven-layer
lamellae that are the essential building block for superconductivity. On the
other hand, a zero-resistivity transition is found to take place well above the
bulk superconducting transition, and the corresponding $T_{\rm c}$ increases
monotonically with $x$ from 2.06 K to 3.29 K. This contrast, together with the
uniform elements distribution revealed by energy dispersive x-ray mapping,
implies that the resistive transition is due to the strain effect at the grain
boundary rather than the compositional inhomogeneity. The first-principles
calculations on the representative composition Sn$_{4}$Sb$_{3}$ ($x$ = 0.43)
indicate that it is topologically nontrivial similar to Sb, but with different

devices communicate to an aggregator node (FPMM receiver) using a novel
Frequency Position Modulation and Multiplexing (FPMM) technique. Such joint

robust to interference at particular frequency bands, it protects against

one-size-fits-all cytotoxic chemotherapy, and towards a more individualized and
specific approach involving the targeting of each tumor's genetic

on certain cellular pathways more than others. With modern advancements in our
understanding of cancer genome sequencing, these pathways can be discovered.
Investigating each of the millions of possible small molecule inhibitors for
each kinase in vitro, however, would be extremely expensive and time consuming.
This project focuses on predicting the inhibition activity of small molecules
targeting 8 different kinases using multiple deep learning models. We trained
fingerprint-based MLPs and simplified molecular-input line-entry specification
(SMILES)-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and molecular graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) to accurately predict inhibitory activity

included in the training set, has gained popularity owing to its potential
ability in the real-word applications. Zero-shot learning models rely on
learning an embedding space, where both semantic descriptions of classes and
visual features of instances can be embedded for nearest neighbor search.
Recently, most of the existing works consider the visual space formulated by
deep visual features as an ideal choice of the embedding space. However, the
discrete distribution of instances in the visual space makes the data structure
unremarkable. We argue that optimizing the visual space is crucial as it allows
semantic vectors to be embedded into the visual space more effectively. In this
work, we propose two strategies to accomplish this purpose. One is the visual
prototype based method, which learns a visual prototype for each visual class,
so that, in the visual space, a class can be represented by a prototype feature
instead of a series of discrete visual features. The other is to optimize the
visual feature structure in an intermediate embedding space, and in this method
we successfully devise a multilayer perceptron framework based algorithm that
is able to learn the common intermediate embedding space and meanwhile to make
the visual data structure more distinctive. Through extensive experimental
evaluation on four benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that optimizing visual
space is beneficial for zero-shot learning. Besides, the proposed prototype
based method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance.

Recently end-to-end learned localization approaches have been proposed which
show promising results on small scale datasets. However the positioning
accuracy, scalability, latency and compute & storage requirements of these
approaches remain open challenges. We aim to deploy localization at
global-scale where one thus relies on methods using local features and sparse
3D models. Our approach spans from offline model building to real-time
client-side pose fusion. The system compresses appearance and geometry of the
scene for efficient model storage and lookup leading to scalability beyond what
what has been previously demonstrated. It allows for low-latency localization
queries and efficient fusion run in real-time on mobile platforms by combining
server-side localization with real-time visual-inertial-based camera pose
tracking. In order to further improve efficiency we leverage a combination of
priors, nearest neighbor search, geometric match culling and a cascaded pose
candidate refinement step. This combination outperforms previous approaches
when working with large scale models and allows deployment at unprecedented
scale. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a proof-of-concept

paper, an efficient and robust numerical method is developed for computing
resonant modes of circular cylinders which may have a few layers and may be
embedded in a layered background. The resonant modes are complex-frequency
outgoing solutions of the Maxwell's equations with no sources or incident
waves. The method uses field expansions in one-dimensional (1D) ``vertical''
modes to reduce the original three-dimensional eigenvalue problem to 1D
problems, and uses Chebyshev pseudospectral method to compute the 1D modes and
set up the discretized eigenvalue problem. In addition, a new iterative scheme
is developed so that the 1D nonlinear eigenvalue problems can be reliably
solved. For metallic cylinders, the resonant modes are calculated based on
analytic models for the dielectric functions of metals. The method is validated
by comparisons with existing numerical results, and it is also used to explore

practice, it might not have adequate coverage probability for the true
treatment effect of a future study under realistic situations. An effective
alternative candidate is the Bayesian prediction interval, which has also been
widely used in general prediction problems. However, these prediction intervals
are constructed based on the Bayesian philosophy, and their frequentist
validities are only justified by large-sample approximations even if
non-informative priors are adopted. There has been no certain evidence that
evaluated their frequentist performances under realistic situations of
meta-analyses. In this study, we conducted extensive simulation studies to
assess the frequentist coverage performances of Bayesian prediction intervals
with 11 non-informative prior distributions under general meta-analysis
settings. Through these simulation studies, we found that frequentist coverage
performances strongly depended on what prior distributions were adopted. In
addition, when the number of studies was smaller than 10, there were no prior
distributions that retained accurate frequentist coverage properties. We also
illustrated these methods via applications to eight real meta-analysis
datasets. The resultant prediction intervals also differed according to the
adopted prior distributions. Inaccurate prediction intervals may provide
invalid evidence and misleading conclusions. Thus, if frequentist accuracy is
required, Bayesian prediction intervals should be used cautiously in practice.

causes information loss. Although most of the time the information lost is
redundant with respect to the target task, there are still cases where

only learn a subset of the features and ignore the rest. This may not be a
problem unless the classification in the test set highly depends on the ignored

generated within a suitable range and kept fixed while the output weights are
computed using the closed form solution as in a standard RVFL network. We also
propose an ensemble deep network (edRVFL) that can be regarded as a marriage of
ensemble learning with deep learning. Unlike traditional ensembling approaches
that require training several models independently from scratch, edRVFL is
obtained by training a single dRVFL network once. Both dRVFL and edRVFL
frameworks are generic and can be used with any RVFL variant. To illustrate
this, we integrate the deep learning networks with a recently proposed
sparse-pretrained RVFL (SP-RVFL). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
from diverse domains show the superior performance of our proposed deep RVFL
networks.

based on the structural balance theory. Each agent in the network has a mixture
of positive and negative links represent friendly and antagonistic interactions
and his stubbornness about interactions. Structural balance theory affirms that
in signed social networks with simultaneous friendly/hostile interactions,
there is a general tendency of evolving over time to reduce the tensions. From
this perspective, individuals iteratively invert their own sentiments to reduce
the felt tensions induced by imbalance. In this paper, we investigate the
consequences of the agents' stubbornness on their interactions. We define
stubbornness as an extreme antagonistic interaction which is resistant to
change. In the current paper, we investigated if the presence of stubborn links
renders an impact on the balance state of the network and whether or not the
degree of balance in a signed network depends on the location of stubborn
links. Our results show that a poorly balanced configuration consists of
multiple antagonistic groups. Both analytical and simulation results
demonstrate that the global level of balance of the network is more influenced
by the locations of stubborn links in the resulting network topology than by
the fraction of stubborn links. This means that even with a large fraction of
stubborn links the network would evolve towards a balanced state. On the other
hand, if a small fraction of stubborn links are clustered in five stubborn
communities, the network evolves to an unbalanced state.

entropic inference. In an (ED) of particles, the central assumption is that
particles have definite yet unknown positions. By appealing to certain
symmetries, one can derive a quantum mechanics of scalar particles and
particles with spin, in which the trajectories of the particles are given by a
stochastic equation. This is much like Nelson's stochastic mechanics which also
assumes a fluctuating particle as the basis of the microstates. The uniqueness
of ED as an entropic inference of particles allows one to continuously
transition between fluctuating particles and the smooth trajectories assumed in
Bohmian mechanics. In this work we explore the consequences of the ED framework
by studying the trajectories of particles in the continuum between stochastic
and Bohmian limits in the context of a few physical examples, which include the
double slit and Stern-Gerlach experiments.

improves the accuracy of the active antenna detection by coding over the
transmit antennas. Specifically, the antenna activation pattern in the SCM
corresponds to a codeword in a properly designed codebook with a larger minimum
Hamming distance than its counterpart conventional spatial modulation. As the
minimum Hamming distance increases, the reliability of the active antenna
detection is directly enhanced, which in turn improves the demodulation of the
modulated symbols and yields a better system reliability. In addition to the
reliability, the proposed SCM scheme also achieves a higher capacity with the
identical antenna configuration compared to the conventional spatial modulation
technique. Moreover, the proposed SCM scheme strikes a balance between spectral
efficiency and reliability by trading off the minimum Hamming distance with the
number of available codewords. The optimal maximum likelihood detector is first
formulated. Then, a low-complexity suboptimal detector is proposed to reduce
the computational complexity, which has a two-step detection. Theoretical
derivations of the channel capacity and the bit error rate are presented in
various channel scenarios, i.e., Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami-m, imperfect
channel state information, and spatial correlation. Further derivation on
performance bounding is also provided to reveal the insight of the benefit of
increasing the minimum Hamming distance. Numerical results validate the
analysis and demonstrate that the proposed SCM outperforms the conventional
spatial modulation techniques in both channel capacity and system reliability.

We sample the novel 2.25-minute vector magnetogram and Dopplergram data from

\emph{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO) spacecraft to create input datasets of
variable cadences ranging from 2.25 minutes to 24 hours. We employ
state-of-the-art data processing, velocity and electric field inversion methods
for deriving estimates of the energy and helicity injections from these
datasets. We find that the electric field inversion methods that reproduce the
observed magnetic field evolution through the use of Faraday's law are more
stable against variable cadence: the PDFI (PTD-Doppler-FLCT-Ideal) electric
field inversion method produces consistent injection estimates for cadences
from 2.25 minutes up to 2 hours, implying that the photospheric processes
acting on time scales below 2 hours contribute little to the injections, or
that they are below the sensitivity of the input data and the PDFI method. On
other hand, the electric field estimate derived from the output of DAVE4VM
(Differential Affine Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms), which does
not fulfil Faraday's law exactly, produces significant variations in the energy
and helicity injection estimates in the 2.25-minute to 2-hour cadence range. We
present also a third, novel DAVE4VM-based electric field estimate, which
corrects the poor inductivity of the raw DAVE4VM estimate. This method is less
sensitive to the changes of cadence, but still faces significant issues for the
lowest of considered cadences ($\geq$2 hours). We find several potential
problems in both PDFI- and DAVE4VM-based injection estimates and conclude that
the quality of both should be surveyed further in controlled environments.

nonequilibrium thermodynamics, which is constructed by generalizing the notion
of port-Lagrangian systems for nonholonomic mechanics proposed in Yoshimura and
Marsden [2006c], where the notion of interconnections is described in terms of
Dirac structures. The notion of port-Lagrangian systems in nonequilibrium
thermodynamics is deduced from the variational formulation of nonequilibrium
thermodynamics developed in Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura [2017a,2017b]. It is a
type of Lagrange-d'Alembert principle associated to a specific class of
nonlinear nonholonomic constraints, called phenomenological constraints, which
are associated to the entropy production equation of the system. To these
phenomenological constraints are systematically associated variational
constraints, which need to be imposed on the variations considered in the
principle. In this paper, by specifically focusing on the cases of simple
thermodynamic systems with constraints, we show how the interconnections in
thermodynamics can be also described by Dirac structures on the Pontryagin
bundle as well as on the cotangent bundle of the thermodynamic configuration
space. Each of these Dirac structures is induced from the variational
constraint. Furthermore, the variational structure associated to this Dirac
formulation is presented in the context of the Lagrange-d'Alembert-Pontryagin
principle. We illustrate our theory with some examples such as a
cylinder-piston with ideal gas as well as an LCR circuit with entropy
production due to a resistor.

have gained a lot of attention recently. An adversary can purposely generate an

incorrectly classified by the neural networks. The adversarial images do not
need to be tuned to a particular architecture of the classifier - an image that
fools one network can fool another one with a certain success rate.The
published works mostly concentrate on the use of modified image files for
attacks against the classifiers trained on the model databases. Although there
exists a general understanding that such attacks can be carried in the real
world as well, the works considering the real-world attacks are scarce.
Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports on the
attacks against real production-grade image classification systems.In our work
we present a robust pipeline for reproducible production of adversarial traffic
signs that can fool a wide range of classifiers, both open-source and
production-grade in the real world. The efficiency of the attacks was checked
both with the neural-network-based classifiers and legacy computer vision
systems. Most of the attacks have been performed in the black-box mode, e.g.
the adversarial signs produced for a particular classifier were used to attack
a variety of other classifiers. The efficiency was confirmed in drive-by
experiments with a production-grade traffic sign recognition systems of a real

particularly the popularity of SonarQube, is increasing rapidly. SonarQube
proposes a set of coding rules, which represent something wrong in the code
that will soon be reflected in a fault or will increase maintenance effort.
However, our local companies were not confident in the usefulness of the rules
proposed by SonarQube and contracted us to investigate the fault-proneness of
these rules. Objective. In this work we aim at understanding which SonarQube
rules are actually fault-prone and to understand which machine learning models
can be adopted to accurately identify fault-prone rules. Method. We designed
and conducted an empirical study on 21 well-known mature open-source projects.
We applied the SZZ algorithm to label the fault-inducing commits. We analyzed
the fault-proneness by comparing the classification power of seven machine
learning models. Result. Among the 202 rules defined for Java by SonarQube,
only 25 can be considered to have relatively low fault-proneness. Moreover,
violations considered as ""bugs"" by SonarQube were generally not fault-prone
and, consequently, the fault-prediction power of the model proposed by
SonarQube is extremely low. Conclusion. The rules applied by SonarQube for
calculating technical debt should be thoroughly investigated and their
harmfulness needs to be further confirmed. Therefore, companies should
carefully consider which rules they really need to apply, especially if their
goal is to reduce fault-proneness.

through clockwise and anticlockwise current states. These oscillations may
persist far beyond the coherence time of polariton condensates. The qubits

superconductor, forms at equilibrium a class-II hyperuniform two-dimensional
point pattern for any constant-$z$ cross section. In this case, density
fluctuations vanish isotropically as $\sim q^{\alpha}$ at small wave-vectors
$q$, with $\alpha=1$. This prediction includes the solid and liquid vortex
phases in the ideal clean case, and the liquid in presence of weak uncorrelated

marginally hyperuniform, while the Bose glass and the liquid phase with

Furthermore, we compare these predictions with experimental results on the
large-wavelength vortex density fluctuations of magnetically decorated vortex
structures nucleated in pristine, electron-irradiated and heavy-ion irradiated
superconducting BiSCCO samples in the mixed state. For most cases we find
hyperuniform two-dimensional point patterns at the superconductor surface with

dispersivity of the elastic constants at intermediate length-scales, and the
lack of hyperuniformity in the $x\,-y$ plane for lengths $q^{-1}$ larger than
the sample thickness due to finite-size effects in the $z$-direction.

microfluidic biosensing system while the latter are measured electrically. The
low-power consumption of the sensor is achieved by an all-analog circuit
implementing Analog Joint Source-Channel Coding (AJSCC) compression. The sensor
is applicable to a wide range of biomedical applications that require real-time
concurrent molecular biomarker and physiological signal monitoring.

Furthermore, it is also expected that these quantum fluctuations get suppressed
with the expansion of the universe. We will show that this desired behavior of
quantum fluctuations could be realized by a wide ranges of the factor ordering

that a similar range of factor ordering parameters produces this desired

probability of $A$ given $B$ is proportional to the probability of $B$ given
$A$. When probabilities are interpreted in the Bayesian sense, Bayes' law
constitutes a learning algorithm which shows how one can learn from a new
observation to improve their belief in a theory that is consistent with that
observation. Kolmogorov's notion of algorithmic information, which is based on
the theory of algorithms, proposes an objective measure of the amount of
information in a finite string about itself and concludes that for any two
finite strings $x$ and $y$, the amount of information in $x$ about $y$ is
almost equal to the amount of information in $y$ about $x$. We view this
conclusion of Kolmogorov as the algorithmic information version of Bayes' law.
This can be easily demonstrated if one considers the work of Levin on prefix
Kolmogorov complexity and then expresses the amount of Kolmogorov mutual
information between two finite strings using Solomonoff's a priori probability.

sensing phenomenon may change rapidly in both time and space, requires sensors
that consume ultra-low power (so that they do not need to be put to sleep
leading to loss of temporal and spatial resolution) and have low costs (for
high density deployment). A novel encoding based on Metal Oxide Semiconductor
Field Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) is proposed to realize Analog Joint Source
Channel Coding (AJSCC), a low-complexity technique to compress two (or more)
signals into one with controlled distortion. In AJSCC, the y-axis is quantized
while the x-axis is continuously captured. A power-efficient design to support
multiple quantization levels is presented so that the digital receiver can
decide the optimum quantization and the analog transmitter circuit is able to
realize that. The approach is verified via Spice and MATLAB simulations.

  pre-event and post-event information fusion",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In post-event reconnaissance missions, engineers and researchers collect
perishable information about damaged buildings in the affected geographical
region to learn from the consequences of the event. A typical post-event
reconnaissance mission is conducted by first doing a preliminary survey,
followed by a detailed survey. The preliminary survey is typically conducted by
driving slowly along a pre-determined route, observing the damage, and noting
where further detailed data should be collected. This involves several manual,
time-consuming steps that can be accelerated by exploiting recent advances in
computer vision and artificial intelligence. The objective of this work is to
develop and validate an automated technique to support post-event
reconnaissance teams in the rapid collection of reliable and sufficiently
comprehensive data, for planning the detailed survey. The technique
incorporates several methods designed to automate the process of categorizing
buildings based on their key physical attributes, and rapidly assessing their
post-event structural condition. It is divided into pre-event and post-event
streams, each intending to first extract all possible information about the
target buildings using both pre-event and post-event images. Algorithms based
on convolutional neural network (CNNs) are implemented for scene (image)
classification. A probabilistic approach is developed to fuse the results
obtained from analyzing several images to yield a robust decision regarding the
attributes and condition of a target building. We validate the technique using
post-event images captured during reconnaissance missions that took place after
hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The validation data were collected by a structural
wind and coastal engineering reconnaissance team, the National Science
Foundation (NSF) funded Structural Extreme Events Reconnaissance (StEER)
Network.
