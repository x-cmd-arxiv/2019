phonetic and semantic variations found in natural language. While techniques
exist for desensitizing features to common noise patterns produced by
Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, the question remains how
to best leverage state-of-the-art language models (which capture rich semantic
features, but are trained on only written text) on inputs with ASR errors. In
this paper, we present Telephonetic, a data augmentation framework that helps
robustify language model features to ASR corrupted inputs. To capture phonetic
alterations, we employ a character-level language model trained using
probabilistic masking. Phonetic augmentations are generated in two stages: a
TTS encoder (Tacotron 2, WaveGlow) and a STT decoder (DeepSpeech). Similarly,
semantic perturbations are produced by sampling from nearby words in an
embedding space, which is computed using the BERT language model. Words are
selected for augmentation according to a hierarchical grammar sampling
strategy. Telephonetic is evaluated on the Penn Treebank (PTB) corpus, and
demonstrates its effectiveness as a bootstrapping technique for transferring
neural language models to the speech domain. Notably, our language model
achieves a test perplexity of 37.49 on PTB, which to our knowledge is
state-of-the-art among models trained only on PTB.

the parameter space of multi-field models of inflation. A generic feature of

$\left[\Delta\phi\right]_\text{G}$ separating any two points laying along the
inflationary trajectory differs from the non-geodesic distance
$\left[\Delta\phi\right]_\text{NG}$ traversed by the inflaton between those

$\left[\Delta\phi\right]_\text{G} =
f\left(\left[\Delta\phi\right]_\text{NG}\right) \leq
\left[\Delta\phi\right]_\text{NG}$, where $f$ is a function determined by the

important constraints on the parameter space characterizing the multi-field

$\left[\Delta\phi\right]_\text{G}$ set by the details of the ultraviolet
completion of inflation, whereas the Lyth bound implies a lower bound on
$\left[\Delta\phi\right]_\text{NG}$ determined by the value of the

primordial tensor perturbations, these two bounds combined lead to tight
constraints on the possible values of the entropy mass of the isocurvature
fields orthogonal to the inflationary trajectory and the rate of turn of the

  Knock Control",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the main factors limiting the efficiency of spark-ignited engines is
the occurrence of engine knock. In high temperature and high pressure
in-cylinder conditions, the fuel-air mixture auto-ignites creating pressure
shock waves in the cylinder. Knock can significantly damage the engine and
hinder its performance; as such, conservative knock control strategies are
generally implemented that avoid such operating conditions at the cost of lower
thermal efficiencies. Significant improvements in the performance of
conventional knock controllers are possible if the properties of the knock
process are better characterized and exploited in knock controller designs. One
of the methods undertaken to better characterize knocking instances is to
employ a probabilistic approach, in which the likelihood of knock is derived
from the statistical distribution of knock intensity. In this paper, it is
shown that knock intensity values at a fixed operating point for single fuel
and dual fuel engines are accurately described using a mixed lognormal
distribution. The fitting accuracy is compared against those for a randomly
generated mixed-lognormally distributed data set, and shown to exceed a 95%
accuracy threshold for almost all of the operating points tested. Additionally,
this paper discusses a stochastic knock control approach that leverages the
mixed lognormal distribution to adjust spark timing based on knock intensity
measurements. This more informed knock control strategy would allow for
improvements in engine performance and fuel efficiency by minimizing knock
occurrences.

  Interaction Tensor","Accepted for presentation at EPIC@CVPR2019 workshop",,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this abstract we describe recent [4,7] and latest work on the
determination of affordances in visually perceived 3D scenes. Our method builds
on the hypothesis that geometry on its own provides enough information to
enable the detection of significant interaction possibilities in the
environment. The motivation behind this is that geometric information is
intimately related to the physical interactions afforded by objects in the
world. The approach uses a generic representation for the interaction between
everyday objects such as a mug or an umbrella with the environment, and also
for more complex affordances such as humans Sitting or Riding a motorcycle.
Experiments with synthetic and real RGB-D scenes show that the representation
enables the prediction of affordance candidate locations in novel environments
at fast rates and from a single (one-shot) training example. The determination
of affordances is a crucial step towards systems that need to perceive and
interact with their surroundings. We here illustrate output on two cases for a
simulated robot and for an Augmented Reality setting, both perceiving in an
egocentric manner.

magnitude-limited surveys of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and its
successor, the intermediate PTF (iPTF). The SNe IIn found and followed by the
PTF/iPTF were used to select a sample of 42 events with useful constraints on
the rise times as well as with available post-peak photometry. The sample SNe
were discovered in 2009-2016 and have at least one low-resolution
classification spectrum, as well as photometry from the P48 and P60 telescopes
at Palomar Observatory. We study the light-curve properties of these SNe IIn
using spline fits (for the peak and the declining portion) and template
matching (for the rising portion). We find that the typical rise times are
divided into fast and slow risers at $20\pm6$ d and $50\pm11$ d, respectively.
The decline rates are possibly divided into two clusters, but this division has
weak statistical significance. We find no significant correlation between the
peak luminosity of SNe IIn and their rise times, but the more luminous SNe IIn
are generally found to be more long-lasting. Slowly rising SNe IIn are
generally found to decline slowly. The SNe in our sample were hosted by
galaxies of absolute magnitude $-22 \lesssim M_g \lesssim -13$ mag. The
K-corrections at light-curve peak of the SNe IIn in our sample are found to be
within 0.2 mag for the observer's frame $r$-band, for SNe at redshifts $z <
0.25$. By applying K-corrections and also including ostensibly ""superluminous""
SNe IIn, we find that the peak magnitudes are $M_{\rm peak}^{r} =
-19.18\pm1.32$ mag. We conclude that the occurrence of conspicuous light-curve
bumps in SNe IIn, such as in iPTF13z, are limited to $1.4^{+14.6}_{-1.0} \%$ of
the SNe IIn. We also investigate a possible sub-type of SNe IIn with a fast
rise to a $\gtrsim 50$ d plateau followed by a slow, linear decline.

that integrability of the colored Alexander polynomial is due to it's relation
to soliton $\tau$-functions. Mainly, the colored Alexander polynomial is
embedded in the action of the KP generating function on the soliton
$\tau$-function. Secondly, we use this correspondence to provide a rather
simple combinatoric description of the group factors in term of Young diagrams,
which is otherwise described in terms of chord diagrams, where no simple
description is known. This is a first step providing an explicit description of
the group theoretic data of Wilson loops, which would effectively reduce them

i.e., $h(\widetilde{x})\neq c(\widetilde{x})$, where $c$ is the ground truth
concept and $h$ is the learned hypothesis. Previous work on PAC learning of
adversarial examples have all modeled adversarial examples as corrupted inputs
in which the goal of the adversary is to achieve $h(\widetilde{x}) \neq c(x)$,
where $x$ is the original untampered instance. These two definitions of
adversarial risk coincide for many natural distributions, such as images, but
are incomparable in general.
  We first prove that for many theoretically natural input spaces of high
dimension $n$ (e.g., isotropic Gaussian in dimension $n$ under $\ell_2$
perturbations), if the adversary is allowed to apply up to a sublinear
$o(||x||)$ amount of perturbations on the test instances, PAC learning requires
sample complexity that is exponential in $n$. This is in contrast with results
proved using the corrupted-input framework, in which the sample complexity of
robust learning is only polynomially more.
  We then formalize hybrid attacks in which the evasion attack is preceded by a
poisoning attack. This is perhaps reminiscent of ""trapdoor attacks"" in which a
poisoning phase is involved as well, but the evasion phase here uses the
error-region definition of risk that aims at misclassifying the perturbed
instances. In this case, we show PAC learning is sometimes impossible all
together, even when it is possible without the attack (e.g., due to the bounded
VC dimension).

segmental length and mass distribution, center of mass positions and moments of
inertia of the major body segments as well as sagittal pelvis and spine
alignment based on literature data. Similarly, muscle strength properties were
adjusted based on CT-derived cross-sectional area measurements. Simulations
were conducted from in vivo studies reported in the literature involving
children and adolescents evaluating maximum trunk muscle strength (MTMS),
lumbar disc compressibility (LDC), intradiscal pressure (IDP) and trunk muscle

we reformulate the global problem into a non-linear interface problem. We then
introduce two new algorithms that are able to efficiently handle the
non-linearity and the coupling between the fracture and the matrix, both based
on linearization by the so-called L-scheme. The first algorithm, named MoLDD,
uses the L-scheme to resolve the non-linearity, requiring at each iteration to
solve the dimensional coupling via a domain decomposition approach. The second
algorithm, called ItLDD, uses a sequential approach in which the dimensional
coupling is part of the linearization iterations. For both algorithms, the
computations are reduced only to the fracture by pre-computing, in an offline
phase, a multiscale flux basis (the linear Robin-to-Neumann co-dimensional
map), that represent the flux exchange between the fracture and the matrix. We
present extensive theoretical findings and in particular, the stability and the
convergence of both schemes are obtained, where user given parameters are
optimized to minimise the number of iterations. Examples on two important

optimization problems. We start with the problem of solving a linear system.
Suppose there is a coordinator together with $s$ servers $P_1, \ldots, P_s$,
the $i$-th of which holds a subset $A^{(i)} x = b^{(i)}$ of $n_i$ constraints
of a linear system in $d$ variables, and the coordinator would like to output
$x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ for which $A^{(i)} x = b^{(i)}$ for $i = 1, \ldots, s$. We
assume each coefficient of each constraint is specified using $L$ bits. We
first resolve the randomized and deterministic communication complexity in the
point-to-point model of communication, showing it is $\tilde{\Theta}(d^2L +
sd)$ and $\tilde{\Theta}(sd^2L)$, respectively. We obtain similar results for
the blackboard model.
  When there is no solution to the linear system, a natural alternative is to
find the solution minimizing the $\ell_p$ loss. While this problem has been
studied, we give improved upper or lower bounds for every value of $p \ge 1$.
One takeaway message is that sampling and sketching techniques, which are
commonly used in earlier work on distributed optimization, are neither optimal
in the dependence on $d$ nor on the dependence on the approximation $\epsilon$,
thus motivating new techniques from optimization to solve these problems.
  Towards this end, we consider the communication complexity of optimization
tasks which generalize linear systems. For linear programming, we first resolve
the communication complexity when $d$ is constant, showing it is
$\tilde{\Theta}(sL)$ in the point-to-point model. For general $d$ and in the
point-to-point model, we show an $\tilde{O}(sd^3 L)$ upper bound and an
$\tilde{\Omega}(d^2 L + sd)$ lower bound. We also show if one perturbs the
coefficients randomly by numbers as small as $2^{-\Theta(L)}$, then the upper
bound is $\tilde{O}(sd^2 L) + \textrm{poly}(dL)$.

spin symmetry provide an interesting laboratory to study general properties of
CFTs and their roles in the AdS/CFT correspondence. In this work we compute the
four-point functions at arbitrary 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$ in the CFTs with
slightly broken higher spin symmetry. We use a bootstrap approach based on the
approximate higher spin Ward identity. We show that the bootstrap equation is
separated into two parts with opposite parity charges, and it leads to a
recursion relation for the $\lambda$ expansions of the correlation functions.
The $\lambda$ expansions terminate at order $\lambda^2$ and the solutions are
exact in $\lambda$. Our work generalizes the approach proposed by Maldacena and
Zhiboedov to four-point correlators, and it amounts to an on-shell study for
the $3D$ Chern-Simons vector models and the Vasiliev theory in $AdS_4$.
Besides, we show that the same results can also be obtained rather simply from
bosonization duality of $3D$ Chern-Simons vector models. The odd term at order
$O(\lambda)$ in the spinning four-point function relates to the free boson
correlator through a Legendre transformation. This provides new evidence on the
$3D$ bosonization duality at the spinning four-point function level. We expect
this work can be generalized to a complete classification of general four-point
functions of single trace currents.

low-energy cut-off; the value that determines the energy of nonthermal
electrons and hence flare energetics. We discuss different approaches to
determine the low-energy cut-off in the spectrum of accelerated electrons: (i)
the total electron number model, (ii) the time-of-flight model (based on the
equivalence of the time-of-flight and the collisional deflection time); (iii)
the warm target model of Kontar et al.~(2015), and (iv) the model of the
spectral cross-over between thermal and nonthermal components. We find that the
first three models are consistent with a low-energy cutoff with a mean value of
$\approx 10$ keV, while the cross-over model provides an upper limit for the
low-energy cutoff with a mean value of $ \approx 21$ keV. Combining the first
three models we find that the ratio of the nonthermal energy to the dissipated
magnetic energy in solar flares has a mean value of $q_E=0.57\pm0.08$, which is
consistent with an earlier study based on the simplified approximation of the
warm target model alone ($q_E=0.51\pm0.17$). This study corroborates the
self-consistency between three different low-energy cutoff models in the
calculation of nonthermal flare energies.

Miller in 1941 and has been studied extensively in the literature. In 1992,
Brightwell and Scheinerman developed the notion of fractional dimension as the
natural linear programming relaxation of the Dushnik-Miller concept. In 2016,
Ueckerdt introduced the concept of local dimension, and in just three years,
several research papers studying this new parameter have been published. In
this paper, we introduce and study fractional local dimension. As suggested by
the terminology, our parameter is a common generalization of fractional
dimension and local dimension.
  For a pair $(n,d)$ with $2\le d<n$, we consider the poset $P(1,d;n)$
consisting of all $1$-element and $d$-element subsets of $\{1,\dots,n\}$
partially ordered by inclusion. This poset has fractional dimension $d+1$, but
for fixed $d\ge2$, its local dimension goes to infinity with $n$. On the other
hand, we show that as $n$ tends to infinity, the fractional local dimension of
$P(1,d;n)$ tends to a value $\text{FLD}(d)$ which we will be able to determine
exactly. For all $d\ge2$, $\text{FLD}(d)$ is strictly less than $d+1$, and for
large $d$, $\text{FLD}(d)\sim d/(\log d-\log\log d-o(1))$. As an immediate
corollary, we show that if $P$ is a poset, and $d$ is the maximum degree of a

control system, referred to as a robot, with respect to a temporal logic
specification in the presence of a dynamic and uncontrollable environment. This
is achieved by modeling the interaction between the robot and its environment
as a two-player zero-sum game. However, existing reactive synthesis methods
assume both players to have complete information, which is not the case in many
strategic interactions. In this paper, we use a variant of hypergames to model
the interaction between the robot and its environment; which has incomplete
information about the specification of the robot. This model allows us to
identify a subset of game states from where the robot can leverage the
asymmetrical information to achieve a better outcome, which is not possible if
both players have symmetrical and complete information. We then introduce a
novel method of opportunistic synthesis by defining a Markov Decision Process
(MDP) using the hypergame under temporal logic specifications. When the
environment plays some stochastic strategy in its perceived sure-winning and
sure-losing regions of the game, we show that by following the opportunistic
strategy, the robot is ensured to only improve the outcome of the game -
measured by satisfaction of sub-specifications - whenever an opportunity
becomes available. We demonstrate the correctness and optimality of this method

The typical workaround is to use variational inference (VI) and maximize a

inference by using a recognition network to parameterize the variational
family. Amortized VI scales approximate posterior inference in deep generative

to approximate posteriors of reduced expressivity due to the problem known as

a paradigm for fitting deep generative models. Unlike VI, EM directly maximizes
the log marginal likelihood of the data. We rediscover the importance weighted
auto-encoder (IWAE) as an instance of EM and propose a new EM-based algorithm
for fitting deep generative models called reweighted expectation maximization
(REM). REM learns better generative models than the IWAE by decoupling the

defining interactions between fields, of the Quantum Wick product. The
resulting theory is ultraviolet finite, but subject to an adiabatic cutoff in
time which seems difficult to remove. We solve this problem here by another
strategy: the fields at a point in the interaction Lagrangian are replaced by
the fields at a quantum point, described by an optimally localized state on
QST; the resulting Lagrangian density agrees with the previous one after
spacetime integration, but gives rise to a different interaction hamiltonian.
But now the methods of perturbative Algebraic Quantum Field Theory can be
applied, and produce an ultraviolet finite perturbation expansion of the
interacting observables. If the obtained theory is tested in an equilibrium
state at finite temperature the adiabatic cutoff in time becomes immaterial,
namely it has no effect on the correlation function at any order in
perturbation theory. Moreover, the interacting vacuum state can be obtained in
the vanishing temperature limit. It is nevertheless important to stress that
the use of states which are optimally localized for a given observer brakes
Lorentz invariance at the very beginning.

Following this encounter, the debris evolves into an elongated stream, half of
which coming back to pericenter. Relativistic apsidal precession then leads to
a self-crossing shock that initiates the formation of an accretion disc. We
perform the first simulation of this process considering a realistic stellar
trajectory and black hole mass, which has so far eluded investigations for
computational reasons. This numerical issue is alleviated by using as initial
conditions the outflow launched by the self-crossing shock according the local
simulation of Lu & Bonnerot (2019). We find that the gas leaving the
intersection point experiences numerous secondary shocks that result in the
rapid formation of a thick and marginally-bound disc. The mass distribution
features two overdensities identified as spiral shocks that drive slow gas
inflow along the mid-plane. Inward motion primarily takes place along the
funnels of the newly-formed torus, from which a fraction of the matter can get
accreted. Further out, the gas moves outward forming an extended envelope
completely surrounding the accretion flow. Secondary shocks heat the debris at
a rate of a few times $10^{44} \, \rm erg \, s^{-1}$ with a large fraction
likely participating to the bolometric luminosity. These results pave the way
towards a complete understanding of the early radiation from TDEs that

consequences. We perform one-dimensional grey radiation-hydrodynamical
simulations with non-equilibrium (two-temperature) radiation transport and

shock temperature T_shock is given by the ""free-streaming"" limit. At low
temperatures the dust opacity can make the shock hotter but not significantly.
We corroborate this with an original semi-analytical derivation of T_shock . We
also estimate the change in luminosity between the shock and the nebula.
Neither T_shock nor the luminosity profile depend directly on the optical depth
between the shock and the nebula. Rather, T_shock depends on the immediate
pre-shock opacity, and the luminosity change on the equation of state (EOS). We
find quite high immediate post-shock entropies (S ~ 13-20 kB/mH), which makes
it seem unlikely that the shock can cool the planet. The global radiation
efficiencies are high (eta^phys > 97%) but the remainder of the total incoming

classical cold starts by orders of magnitude. Overall, these findings suggest

of the intensity field but accounting for foregrounds, the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) for $C_\ell^{\phi\phi}$ using our SFB estimator increases by 107%.
This shows that accounting for the curved sky in LIM weak lensing will be

as in the Ly$\beta$ forest along $19$ quasar sightlines between $5.5\lesssim
z_{\rm abs}\lesssim 6.1$, probing the end stages of the reionization epoch.
Owing to its lower oscillator strength the Ly$\beta$ transition is sensitive to
different gas temperatures and densities than Ly$\alpha$, providing additional
constraints on the ionization and thermal state of the IGM. A comparison of our
measurements to different inhomogeneous reionization models, derived from
post-processing the Nyx cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to include
spatial fluctuations in the ultraviolet background (UVB) or the gas temperature
field, as well as to a uniform reionization model with varying thermal states
of the IGM, leads to two primary conclusions: First, we find that including the
effects of spectral noise is key for a proper data to model comparison. Noise
effectively reduces the sensitivity to high opacity regions, and thus even
stronger spatial inhomogeneities are required to match the observed scatter in
the observations than previously inferred. Second, we find that models which
come close to reproducing the distribution of Ly$\alpha$ effective optical
depths nevertheless underpredict the Ly$\beta$ opacity at the same spatial
locations. The origin of this disagreement is not entirely clear but models
with an inversion in the temperature-density relation of the IGM just after
reionization is completed match our measurements best, although they still do
not fully capture the observations at $z\gtrsim 5.8$.

show that all these constraints on the latent space, class-specific knowledge,

effective machining method for the modification and passivation of GaSb using a

the nanofibre growth and allowed for controlled etching. Moreover, the milled

of a gallium fluoride layer, which inhibits the catalytic vapour-liquid-solid

numbers of agents, no requirement that students grade multiple assignments,
arbitrary but homogeneous noisy observation of the ground truth which students
can pay a fixed cost to observe, and the possibility of misreporting grades
before or after observing this signal. We give necessary and sufficient

considerable over the last few decades. The demand for tools to analyze such
data is therefore bigger now than ever. We present TDOSE; a flexible Python
tool for Three Dimensional Optimal Spectral Extraction from IFS data cubes.
TDOSE works on any three-dimensional data cube and bases the spectral
extractions on morphological reference image models. In each wavelength layer
of the IFS data cube, TDOSE simultaneously optimizes all sources in the
morphological model to minimize the difference between the scaled model
components and the IFS data. The flux optimization produces individual data
cubes containing the scaled three-dimensional source models. This allows for
efficient de-blending of flux in both the spatial and spectral dimensions of
the IFS data cubes, and extraction of the corresponding one-dimensional
spectra. We present an example of how the three-dimensional source models
generated by TDOSE can be used to improve two-dimensional maps of physical
parameters. By extracting TDOSE spectra of $\sim$150 [OII] emitters from the
MUSE-Wide survey we show that the median increase in line flux is $\sim$5% when
using multi-component models as opposed to single-component models. However,
the increase in recovered line emission in individual cases can be as much as
50%. Comparing the TDOSE model-based extractions of the MUSE-Wide [OII]
emitters with aperture spectra, the TDOSE spectra provides a median flux (S/N)
increase of 9% (14%). Hence, TDOSE spectra optimizes the S/N while still being
able to recover the total emitted flux. TDOSE version 3.0 presented in this

in lunar samples and the evolution of activity of solar analogues over time,
the Sun is highly likely to have been a slow rotator. Since the young Sun's
activity was important in affecting the evolution of planetary surfaces,
atmospheres, and habitability in the early Solar System, this is an important
constraint on the solar activity environment at that time. Finally, since solar
activity was strongest in the first billion years of the Solar System, when the
Moon was most heavily bombarded by impactors, evolution of the Sun's activity
may also be recorded in lunar crust and would be an important well-preserved
and relatively accessible record of past Solar System processes.

Semantics-to-Space (S2S) architecture where semantics derived from the residing

architecture allows the co-capturing of the semantic attributes of the human

validate, we have constructed a new dataset, Verb-Transferability 60 (VT60).
VT60 provides 60 different VO pairs with overlapping verbs tailored for testing
two-stream ZSL approaches with VO query. Experimental evaluations show that our

forcibly sharing an initialization can lead to conflicts among tasks and the
compromised (undesired by tasks) location on optimization landscape, thereby
hindering the task adaptation. Further, we observe that the degree of conflict
differs among not only tasks but also layers of a neural network. Thus, we
propose task-and-layer-wise attenuation on the compromised initialization to
reduce its influence. As the attenuation dynamically controls (or selectively
forgets) the influence of prior knowledge for a given task and each layer, we
name our method as L2F (Learn to Forget). The experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method provides faster adaptation and greatly improves the

question that arises is whether attention can be a stand-alone primitive for
vision models instead of serving as just an augmentation on top of
convolutions. In developing and testing a pure self-attention vision model, we
verify that self-attention can indeed be an effective stand-alone layer. A
simple procedure of replacing all instances of spatial convolutions with a form
of self-attention applied to ResNet model produces a fully self-attentional

Improved Dense Trajectory (IDT) and extracted with its low-level video
descriptors encoded via Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Fisher Vectors (FV). Such a
fusion of CNNs and handcrafted representations is time-consuming due to
pre-processing, descriptor extraction, encoding and tuning parameters. Thus, we
propose an end-to-end trainable network with streams which learn the IDT-based
BoW/FV representations at the training stage and are simple to integrate with
the I3D model. Specifically, each stream takes I3D feature maps ahead of the
last 1D conv. layer and learns to `translate' these maps to BoW/FV
representations. Thus, our model can hallucinate and use such synthesized
BoW/FV representations at the testing stage. We show that even features of the
entire I3D optical flow stream can be hallucinated thus simplifying the
pipeline. Our model saves 20-55h of computations and yields state-of-the-art

on multiple components of which localization, navigation, obstacle avoidance,

testing the hypothesis that different types of nonlinearity can be observed in
HRV depending on the method adopted and on the physiopathological state. Two
entropy-based measures of time series complexity (normalized complexity index,
NCI) and regularity (information storage, IS), and a measure quantifying
deviations from linear correlations in a time series (Gaussian linear contrast,
GLC), are applied to short HRV recordings obtained in young (Y) and old (O)
healthy subjects and in myocardial infarction (MI) patients monitored in the
resting supine position and in the upright position reached through head-up
tilt. The method of surrogate data is employed to detect the presence of and
quantify the contribution of nonlinear dynamics to HRV. We find that the three
measures differ both in their variations across groups and conditions and in
the number and strength of nonlinear HRV dynamics detected: at rest, IS reveals
a significantly lower number of nonlinear dynamics in Y, whereas during tilt
GLC reveals significantly stronger nonlinear HRV dynamics in MI; in the
transition from rest to tilt, all measures detect a significant weakening of
nonlinear HRV dynamics in Y, while only GLC detects a significant strengthening
of such dynamics in MI. These results suggest that distinct dynamic structures,
detected with different sensitivity by nonlinear measures, lie beneath
short-term HRV in different physiological states and pathological conditions.

where dark matter sheet folds in phase-space. The caustics separate regions
with different number of streams and the volume elements change the parity by
turning inside out when passing through the caustic stage. Being measure-zero
structures, identification of caustics via matter density fields is usually
restricted to fine-grained simulations. Here we employ a generic algorithm to
identify caustics directly using the triangulation of the Lagrangian
sub-manifold x(q,t) obtained in N-body simulations. In our approach the caustic
surfaces are approximated by a set of triangles whose vertices are particles of
the simulation. The major obstacle we encountered was insufficient sampling of
small scale perturbations. We overcame it by a brute force approach. We
continued to raise the scale of the cutoff in the initial power spectrum until
obtained the reliable resolution of the caustics shells up to seven layers.
Although quite modest, our result is the first reliable direct construction of
caustic surfaces in N-body simulation. It reveals a number of unexpected
geometrical features. In particular shapes of some of them are contrastingly
different from the known shapes of the caustics formed in the Zeldovich

architectural scheme to optimize the memory accesses and therefore boost the
performance and energy efficiency of GPU. Firstly, we propose a thread batch
enabled memory partitioning (TEMP) to improve GPU memory access parallelism. In
particular, TEMP groups multiple thread blocks that share the same set of pages
into a thread batch and applies a page coloring mechanism to bound each stream
multiprocessor (SM) to the dedicated memory banks. After that, TEMP dispatches
the thread batch to an SM to ensure high-parallel memory-access streaming from
the different thread blocks. Secondly, a thread batch-aware scheduling (TBAS)
scheme is introduced to improve the GPU memory access locality and to reduce
the contention on memory controllers and interconnection networks. Experimental
results show that the integration of TEMP and TBAS can achieve up to 10.3%
performance improvement and 11.3% DRAM energy reduction across diverse GPU
applications. We also evaluate the performance interference of the mixed
CPU+GPU workloads when they are run on a heterogeneous system that employs our
proposed schemes. Our results show that a simple solution can effectively
ensure the efficient execution of both GPU and CPU applications.

CuNi(CN)$_4$ adopts a layered structure related to that of Ni(CN)$_2$ (x = 0),
and interestingly exhibits 2D NTE which is about 1.5 times larger. Inelastic
neutron scattering (INS) measurements combined with first principles lattice
dynamical calculations provide insights into the effect of Cu$^{2+}$ on the
underlying mechanisms behind the anomalous thermal behavior in all the
Cu$_x$Ni$_{2-x}$(CN)$_4$ compounds. The solid solutions are presently reported

increases in Cu$_x$Ni$_{2-x}$(CN)$_4$, large shifts to lower energies are
observed in modes consisting of localized in- and out-of-plane librational
motions of the CN ligand, which contribute to the NTE in CuNi(CN)$_4$. Mode
Gr\""uneisen parameters calculated for CuNi(CN)$_4$ show that acoustic and
low-energy optic modes contribute the most to the NTE, as previously shown in
Ni(CN)$_2$. However, mode eigenvectors reveal a large deformation of the [CuN4]
units compared to the [NiC4] units, resulting in phonon modes not found in
Ni(CN)$_2$, whose NTE-driving phonons consist predominately of rigid-unit
modes. The deformations in CuNi(CN)$_4$ arise because the d$^9$ square-planar
center is easier to deform than the d$^8$ one, resulting in a greater range of
out-of-plane motions for the adjoining ligands.

is a core component of intelligent agents and an ongoing challenge for Deep
Reinforcement Learning (RL). Street View can be a sensible testbed for such RL
agents, because it provides real-world photographic imagery at ground level,
with diverse street appearances; it has been made into an interactive
environment called StreetLearn and used for research on navigation. However,
goal-driven street navigation agents have not so far been able to transfer to
unseen areas without extensive retraining, and relying on simulation is not a
scalable solution. Since aerial images are easily and globally accessible, we
propose instead to train a multi-modal policy on ground and aerial views, then
transfer the ground view policy to unseen (target) parts of the city by
utilizing aerial view observations. Our core idea is to pair the ground view
with an aerial view and to learn a joint policy that is transferable across
views. We achieve this by learning a similar embedding space for both views,
distilling the policy across views and dropping out visual modalities. We
further reformulate the transfer learning paradigm into three stages: 1)
cross-modal training, when the agent is initially trained on multiple city
regions, 2) aerial view-only adaptation to a new area, when the agent is
adapted to a held-out region using only the easily obtainable aerial view, and
3) ground view-only transfer, when the agent is tested on navigation tasks on
unseen ground views, without aerial imagery. Experimental results suggest that
the proposed cross-view policy learning enables better generalization of the
agent and allows for more effective transfer to unseen environments.

  We have studied magnetic properties of water-quenched 5 wt.% (Fe, Ti)

refinement is achieved by increasing cooling rate, which implies an increase of
grainboundaries in the superconductor. Here we show that increased
grainboundaries influence what kinds of effects on the field dependence of
magnetization and what is the mechanism. As a result, they are served as a
pinning center at a high field whereas they are served as a pathway to
facilitate the movement of fluxes pinned on volume defects at a low field. As
modeling grainboundaries in a superconductor, we explained that they had a flux
pinning effect as well as the flux-penetrating promotion effect. As temperature
increases, the pinning ability of a grainboundaries decreases, which was caused
by increased coherence length. Stacking fault planes and twin boundaries have
also been considered by using the model. It explained the reason for that
stacking fault planes of MgB$_2$ do not have any pinning effect and the twin
boundary of HTSC have the strong pinning or strong flux-penetration effect

intractable, but simulation is cheap. The distance considered, maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD), is defined through the embedding of probability measures
into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We study the theoretical properties of
these estimators, showing that they are consistent, asymptotically normal and
robust to model misspecification. A main advantage of these estimators is the
flexibility offered by the choice of kernel, which can be used to trade-off
statistical efficiency and robustness. On the algorithmic side, we study the
geometry induced by MMD on the parameter space and use this to introduce a
novel natural gradient descent-like algorithm for efficient implementation of
these estimators. We illustrate the relevance of our theoretical results on
several classes of models including a discrete-time latent Markov process and
two multivariate stochastic differential equation models.

entities to shape macroscopically ordered structures, is ubiquitous in Nature.
Spatio-temporal patterns are abundantly observed in a large plethora of
applications, encompassing different fields and scales. Examples of emerging
patterns are the spots and stripes on the coat or skin of animals, the spatial
distribution of vegetation in arid areas, the organization of the colonies of
insects in host-parasitoid systems and the architecture of large complex
ecosystems. Spatial self-organization can be described following the visionary
intuition of Alan Turing, who showed how non-linear interactions between slow
diffusing activators and fast diffusing inhibitors could induce patterns. The
Turing instability, as the mechanism described is universally referred to, was
raised to paradigm status in those realms of investigations where microscopic
entities are subject to diffusion, from small biological systems to large
ecosystems. Requiring a significant ratio of the assigned diffusion constants
however is a stringent constraint, which limited the applicability of the
theory. Building on the observation that spatial interactions are usually
direction biased, and often strongly asymmetric, we here propose a novel
framework for the generation of short wavelength patterns which overcomes the
limitation inherent in the Turing formulation. In particular, we will prove
that patterns can always set in when the system is composed by sufficiently
many cells - the units of spatial patchiness - and for virtually any ratio of
the diffusivities involved. Macroscopic patterns that follow the onset of the
instability are robust and show oscillatory or steady-state behavior.

misalignment arises due to various reasons including differing initial phase,

biomechanics. Past work in this area has only looked at reducing intra-class

model-based and data-driven approach to learn warping functions that not just
reduce intra-class variability, but also increase inter-class separation. We
call this a temporal transformer network (TTN). TTN is an interpretable
differentiable module, which can be easily integrated at the front end of a
classification network. The module is capable of reducing intra-class variance
by generating input-dependent warping functions which lead to rate-robust
representations. At the same time, it increases inter-class variance by
learning warping functions that are more discriminative. We show improvements
over strong baselines in 3D action recognition on challenging datasets using
the proposed framework. The improvements are especially pronounced when

hand-designed attentional mechanisms, our memory is internal, distributed,

drastically simpler than prior efforts. Architecting networks with multigrid
structure and connectivity, while distributing memory cells alongside
computation throughout this topology, we observe the emergence of coherent
memory subsystems. Our hierarchical spatial organization, parameterized
convolutionally, permits efficient instantiation of large-capacity memories,
while multigrid topology provides short internal routing pathways, allowing
convolutional networks to efficiently approximate the behavior of fully
connected networks. Such networks have an implicit capacity for internal
attention; augmented with memory, they learn to read and write specific memory
locations in a dynamic data-dependent manner. We demonstrate these capabilities
on exploration and mapping tasks, where our network is able to self-organize
and retain long-term memory for trajectories of thousands of time steps. On
tasks decoupled from any notion of spatial geometry: sorting, associative
recall, and question answering, our design functions as a truly generic memory

processes are the main ones for extractions of TMD parton distribution
functions and TMD fragmentation functions, which encode important information
about nucleon structure and hadronization. One of the most widely used TMD
factorization formalism in phenomenology formulates TMD observables in

Fourier transform from $b_\perp$-space back into transverse momentum space is
sufficiently complicated due to oscillatory integrands that it requires a

survives to the present day, primordial black holes (PBHs) have drawn
increasing attention recently. Up to now, various observations have strongly
constrained most of the mass range for PBHs, leaving only small windows where
PBHs could make up a substantial fraction of the dark matter. Here we revisit
the PBH constraints for the asteroid-mass window, i.e., the mass range
$3.5\times 10^{-17}M_\odot < m_{\mathrm{PBH}} < 4\times 10^{-12}M_\odot$. We
revisit 3 categories of constraints. (1) For optical microlensing, we analyze
the finite source size and diffractive effects and discuss the scaling
relations between the event rate, $m_{\mathrm{PBH}}$ and the event duration. We
argue that it will be difficult to push the existing optical microlensing
constraints to much lower m$_{\mathrm{PBH}}$. (2) For dynamical capture of PBHs
in stars, we derive a general result on the capture rate based on phase space
arguments. We argue that survival of stars does not constrain PBHs, but that
disruption of stars by captured PBHs should occur and that the asteroid-mass
PBH hypothesis could be constrained if we can work out the observational
signature of this process. (3) For destruction of white dwarfs by PBHs that
pass through the white dwarf without getting gravitationally captured, but
which produce a shock that ignites carbon fusion, we perform a 1+1D
hydrodynamic simulation to explore the post-shock temperature and relevant
timescales, and again we find this constraint to be ineffective. In summary, we
find that the asteroid-mass window remains open for PBHs to account for all the
dark matter.

the mutual information between uncertain model parameters and the predicted
data to be collected from the sensors for the purpose of performing Bayesian
inference. Equivalently, the expected information entropy of the posterior of
the model parameters is minimized over all possible sensor configurations for a
given sensor budget. In the context of structural dynamical systems, this
minimization is computationally expensive because of the large number of
possible sensor configurations. Here, a very efficient convex relaxation scheme
is presented to determine informative and possibly-optimal solutions to the
problem, thereby bypassing the necessity for an exhaustive, and often
infeasible, combinatorial search. The key idea is to relax the binary sensor
location vector so that its components corresponding to all possible sensor
locations lie in the unit interval. Then, the optimization over this vector is
a convex problem that can be efficiently solved. This method always yields a
unique solution for the relaxed problem, which is often binary and therefore
the optimal solution to the original problem. When not binary, the relaxed
solution is often suggestive of what the optimal solution for the original
problem is. An illustrative example using a fifty-story shear building model
subject to sinusoidal ground motion is presented, including a case where there
are over 47 trillion possible sensor configurations. The solutions and
computational effort are compared to greedy and heuristic methods.

Ideal tearing, in 2D sheets, triggers a hierarchical collapse via stretching of

high-dimensional time series as a sum of spatiotemporal modes, where the
temporal modes are constrained by linear dynamics. For nonlinear dynamical
systems exhibiting strongly coherent structures, DMD can be a useful
approximation to extract dominant, interpretable modes. In many domains with
large spatiotemporal data---including fluid dynamics, video processing, and
finance---the dynamics of interest are often perturbations about fixed points
or equilibria, which motivates the application of DMD to centered (i.e.
mean-subtracted) data. In this work, we show that DMD with centered data is
equivalent to incorporating an affine term in the dynamic model and is not
equivalent to computing a discrete Fourier transform. Importantly, DMD with
centering can always be used to compute eigenvalue spectra of the dynamics.
However, in many cases DMD without centering cannot model the corresponding
dynamics, most notably if the dynamics have full effective rank. Additionally,
we generalize the notion of centering to extracting arbitrary, but known, fixed
frequencies from the data. We corroborate these theoretical results numerically
on three nonlinear examples: the Lorenz system, a surveillance video, and brain
recordings. Since centering the data is simple and computationally efficient,
we recommend it as a preprocessing step before DMD; furthermore, we suggest
that it can be readily used in conjunction with many other popular
implementations of the DMD algorithm.

transferring the populations between two discrete quantum states and has been
used to prepare molecules in their rovibrational ground state. In realistic
molecules, a well-resolved intermediate state is usually selected to implement
the resonant STIRAP. Due to the complex molecular level structures, the detuned
STIRAP always coexists with the resonant STIRAP and may cause unexpected
interference phenomenon. However, it is generally accepted that the detuned
STIRAP can be neglected if compared with the resonant STIRAP. Here we report on
the first observation of interference between the resonant and detuned STIRAP
in the adiabatic creation of $^{23}$Na$^{40}$K ground-state molecules. The
interference is identified by observing that the number of Feshbach molecules
after a round-trip STIRAP oscillates as a function of the hold time, with a
visibility of about 90\%. This occurs even if the intermediate excited states
are well resolved, and the single-photon detuning of the detuned STIRAP is
about one order of magnitude larger than the linewidth of the excited state and
the Rabi frequencies of the STIRAP lasers. Moreover, the observed interference
indicates that if more than one hyperfine level of the ground state is
populated, the STIRAP prepares a coherent superposition state among them, but
not an incoherent mixed state. Further, the purity of the hyperfine levels of
the created ground state can be quantitatively determined by the visibility of
the oscillation.

with masses below 3.5 and 3.8 TeV, respectively, are excluded at 95% confidence

derive constraints on the former. Here, we extend this analysis by finding
similar correlations for varying chirp masses, the dominant determining factor

on the nuclear parameters with future observations can improve from the current
one with GW170817 only by $\sim 30\%$ due to the existence of systematic errors
caused mainly by the remaining uncertainty in the equation of state near and
just above the nuclear saturation density. We show that such systematic errors
can be reduced by considering multidimensional correlations among nuclear
parameters and tidal deformabilities with various neutron star masses.

suggests that the epitaxial ZnO/MgO bilayer tunnel barrier is effective for
enhancing the $\beta_{0}$ without significant increase in the RA. In addition,

I), \qquad x \in \Omega, \ t\geq 0,\] where $\Phi$ is an $n\times n$ real
matrix-valued field, $\Omega$ is a two-dimensional square with periodic
boundary conditions, and $\varepsilon > 0$. This equation is the gradient flow
for the energy, $E(\Phi) := \int \frac{1}{2} \|\nabla \Phi \|^2_F+\frac{1}{4
\varepsilon^2} \| \Phi^t \Phi - I \|^2_F$, where $\| \cdot \|_F$ denotes the
Frobenius norm. The primary contribution of this paper is to use asymptotic
methods to describe the solution of this initial value problem. If the initial
condition has single-signed determinant, at each point of the domain, at a fast
$O(\varepsilon^{-2} t)$ time scale, the solution evolves towards the closest
orthogonal matrix. Then, at the $O(t)$ time scale, the solution evolves
according to the $O_n$ diffusion equation. Stationary solutions to the $O_n$
diffusion equation are analyzed for $n=2$. If the initial condition has regions
where the determinant is positive and negative, a free interface develops. Away
from the interface, in each region, the matrix-valued field behaves as in the
single-signed determinant case. At the $O(t)$ time scale, the interface evolves
in the normal direction by curvature. At a slow $O(\varepsilon t)$ time scale,
the interface is driven by curvature and the surface diffusion of the
matrix-valued field. For $n=2$, the interface is driven by curvature and the
jump in the squared tangental derivative of the phase across the interface. In
particular, we emphasize that the interface when $n\geq 2$ is driven by surface
diffusion, while for $n=1$, the original Allen--Cahn equation, the interface is
only driven by mean curvature. A variety of numerical experiments are performed
to verify, support, and illustrate our analytical results.

metrics in the non-overlapping subspaces of the embedding space, defined by
groups of neurons in the embedding layer of the neural network. The proposed

bilayer where a magic angle is needed to form the flat band, for the polar
$h$BN, the flat bands can appear as long as the twisted angle is less than

(conduction band minimum) states are predominantly resided in the regions of
the moir\'{e} supperlattice where the anion N (cation B) atoms in both layers
are on top of each other. The preferential localization of these valence and
conduction states originate from the chemical potential difference between N

respectively, as demonstrated by an analysis of the energy level order of the

completely flat bands will form. This mechanism is applicable to other twisted

the Wigner and Clauser-Horne forms of LGI are found to be more suitable as

customers away from the market leader. In this paper, we formalize a new model
called the Stackelberg budget allocation game with a bipartite influence model
by extending a budget allocation problem over a bipartite graph to a

algorithm with provable guarantees and an efficient heuristic algorithm. In
addition, for a special case where customers are disjoint, we propose an exact
algorithm based on linear programming. Our experiments using real-world
datasets demonstrate that our algorithms outperform a baseline algorithm even
when the follower is a powerful competitor.

Periodic codes are binary codes with a special patterned form that reflects the
periodicity of the stimulus. Because these codes can be used by the owl to
localize sounds within a convex set of angles, we investigate whether they are
examples of convex codes, which have previously been studied for hippocampal
place cells. We find that periodic codes are typically not convex, but can be
completed to convex codes in the presence of noise. We introduce the convex
closure and Hamming distance completion as ways of adding codewords to make a
code convex, and describe the convex closure of a periodic code. We also find
that the probability of the convex closure arising stochastically is greater
for sparser codes. Finally, we provide an algebraic method using the neural
ideal to detect if a code is periodic. We find that properties of periodic
codes help to explain several aspects of the behavior observed in the sound
localization system of the barn owl, including common errors in localizing pure

increase link capacity and energy efficiency. However, these benefits are based
on available channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS).
Therefore, user equipment (UE) needs to keep on feeding CSI back to the BS,
thereby consuming precious bandwidth resource. Large-scale antennas at the BS
for massive MIMO seriously increase this overhead. In this paper, we propose a
multiple-rate compressive sensing neural network framework to compress and
quantize the CSI. This framework not only improves reconstruction accuracy but
also decreases storage space at the UE, thus enhancing the system feasibility.
Specifically, we establish two network design principles for CSI feedback,
propose a new network architecture, CsiNet+, according to these principles, and
develop a novel quantization framework and training strategy. Next, we further
introduce two different variable-rate approaches, namely, SM-CsiNet+ and
PM-CsiNet+, which decrease the parameter number at the UE by 38.0% and 46.7%,
respectively. Experimental results show that CsiNet+ outperforms the
state-of-the-art network by a margin but only slightly increases the parameter
number. We also investigate the compression and reconstruction mechanism behind
deep learning-based CSI feedback methods via parameter visualization, which
provides a guideline for subsequent research.

approach. When the quantum and classical descriptions are compared, the
transmission, reflection, and absorption rates of the metasurface exhibit
substantial differences at shorter gap distances. The differences are caused by
electron transport through the gaps of the nano-objects. The electron transport
has profound influences for gap distances less-than or approximately 0.2 nm;
that is, almost equal to half of the distance found in conventional gap
plasmonics in isolated systems, such as metallic nanodimers. Furthermore, it is
shown that the electron transport makes the plasmon features of the metasurface
unclear and produces broad spectral structures in the optical responses. In
particular, the reflection response exhibits rapid attenuation as the gap
distance decreases, while the absorption response extends over a wide spectral
range.

potential performance is compared with that of the Heterojunction with
Intrinsic Thin film (HIT) and Heterojunction of Amorphous silicon and
Crystalline silicon with Diffused junction (HACD) solar cells. The simulated
results indicated that the conversion efficiency and the short-circuit current
density of the HACL cell can reach to 28.18% and 43.06 mA/cm2, respectively,

great improvement are (1) to increase the light utilization rate on both sides

Moreover, the HACL structure can decrease the consumption of rare materials,
such as indium, since the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) can be free in

become more discriminate and improve the overall performance. By employing the

robustly addressed. It provides the spatial location for each character, which
not only helps local feature extraction in word recognition, but also indicates
an orientation angle to refine text localization. Our proposed method has

learning approach to overcome the computational challenge. A deep neural
network (DNN) is used to approximate the power flow calculation and is trained
according to the physical power flow equations to improve its learning ability.
The training process consists of several steps: 1) the branch flows are added
into the objective function of the DNN as a penalty term, which improves the
approximation accuracy of the DNN; 2) the gradients used in the back
propagation process are simplified according to the physical characteristics of
the transmission grid, which accelerates the training speed while maintaining
effective guidance of the physical model; and 3) an improved initialization
method for the DNN parameters is proposed to improve the convergence speed. The
simulation results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed
method in standard IEEE and utility benchmark systems.

Bayesian inference to models for which the likelihood function is intractable.
Although these developments allow us to estimate model parameters, other basic
problems such as estimating the marginal likelihood, a fundamental tool in
Bayesian model selection, remain challenging. This is an important scientific
limitation because testing psychological hypotheses with hierarchical models
has proven difficult with current model selection methods. We propose an
efficient method for estimating the marginal likelihood for models where the
likelihood is intractable, but can be estimated unbiasedly. It is based on
first running a sampling method such as MCMC to obtain samples for the model
parameters, and then using these samples to construct the proposal density in
an importance sampling (IS) framework with an unbiased estimate of the
likelihood. Our method has several attractive properties: it generates an
unbiased estimate of the marginal likelihood, it is robust to the quality and
target of the sampling method used to form the IS proposals, and it is
computationally cheap to estimate the variance of the marginal likelihood
estimator. We also obtain the convergence properties of the method and provide
guidelines on maximizing computational efficiency. The method is illustrated in
two challenging cases involving hierarchical models: identifying the form of
individual differences in an applied choice scenario, and evaluating the best
parameterization of a cognitive model in a speeded decision making context.
Freely available code to implement the methods is provided. Extensions to
posterior moment estimation and parallelization are also discussed.

harmful for detection task, we argue that it can be utilized to improve the
performance by fusing the results of differently initialized detectors. To
implement this idea, we propose an end-to-end framework with multiple detection
branches, and introduce a simple fusion strategy. We further propose an
orthogonal initialization method to increase the difference between detection

delivery and increased connectivity. In this respect, caching and
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) paradigms have been recently proposed as
potential solutions to effectively address some of these key challenges. In the
present contribution, we introduce cache-aided NOMA as an enabling technology
for vehicular networks. In this context, we first consider the full file
caching case, where each vehicle caches and requests entire files using the
NOMA principle. Without loss of generality, we consider a two-user vehicular
network communication scenario under double Nakagami$-m$ fading conditions and
propose an optimum power allocation policy. To this end, an optimization
problem that maximizes the overall probability of successful decoding of files
at each vehicle is formulated and solved. Furthermore, we consider the case of
split file caching, where each file is divided into two parts. A joint power
allocation optimization problem is formulated, where power allocation across
vehicles and cached split files is investigated. The offered analytic results
are corroborated by extensive results from computer simulations and interesting
insights are developed. Indicatively, it is shown that the proposed
caching-aided NOMA outperforms the conventional NOMA technique.

Perturbation Dependent Results). Based on this, we propose a model agnostic
dual quality assessment method, together with the concept of robustness levels

metric used (i.e., $L_0$ or $L_\infty$), the robustness may vary significantly.
Hence, the duality should be taken into account for a correct evaluation.
Moreover, a mathematical derivation, as well as a counter-example, suggest that
$L_1$ and $L_2$ metrics alone are not sufficient to avoid spurious adversarial
samples. Interestingly, the threshold attack of the proposed assessment is a
novel $L_\infty$ black-box adversarial method which requires even less

large number of papers have contributed to applying different technologies.
Regretfully, most of them had served little purposes in coping with the
extremely poor illumination parts of images or test in practice. In this work,
the authors propose a novel approach for processing low-light images based on
the Retinex theory and generative adversarial network (GAN), which is composed
of the decomposition part for splitting the image into illumination image and
reflected image, and the enhancement part for generating high-quality image.
Such a discriminative network is expected to make the generated image clearer.
Couples of experiments have been implemented under the circumstance of
different lighting strength on the basis of Converted See-In-the-Dark (CSID)
datasets, and the satisfactory results have been achieved with exceeding

features as an input propagates through the network. This paper sets out to
harvest these rich intermediate representations for quantization with minimal
accuracy loss while significantly reducing the memory footprint and compute
intensity of the DNN. This paper utilizes knowledge distillation through
teacher-student paradigm (Hinton et al., 2015) in a novel setting that exploits
the feature extraction capability of DNNs for higher-accuracy quantization. As
such, our algorithm logically divides a pretrained full-precision DNN to
multiple sections, each of which exposes intermediate features to train a team
of students independently in the quantized domain. This divide and conquer
strategy, in fact, makes the training of each student section possible in
isolation while all these independently trained sections are later stitched
together to form the equivalent fully quantized network. Our algorithm is a
sectional approach towards knowledge distillation and is not treating the
intermediate representation as a hint for pretraining before one knowledge
distillation pass over the entire network (Romero et al., 2015). Experiments on
various DNNs (AlexNet, LeNet, MobileNet, ResNet-18, ResNet-20, SVHN and VGG-11)
show that, this approach -- called DCQ (Divide and Conquer Quantization) -- on
average, improves the performance of a state-of-the-art quantized training
technique, DoReFa-Net (Zhou et al., 2016) by 21.6% and 9.3% for binary and

DCQ to existing quantized training methods leads to improved accuracies as

while enforcing that a subset of the learned latent codes are interpretable and
associated with distinct properties of the target distribution. Recent advances
have been dominated by Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)-based methods, while
training disentangled generative adversarial networks (GANs) remains
challenging. In this work, we show that the dominant challenges facing
disentangled GANs can be mitigated through the use of self-supervision. We make
two main contributions: first, we design a novel approach for training
disentangled GANs with self-supervision. We propose contrastive regularizer,
which is inspired by a natural notion of disentanglement: latent traversal.
This achieves higher disentanglement scores than state-of-the-art VAE- and
GAN-based approaches. Second, we propose an unsupervised model selection scheme
called ModelCentrality, which uses generated synthetic samples to compute the
medoid (multi-dimensional generalization of median) of a collection of models.
The current common practice of hyper-parameter tuning requires using
ground-truths samples, each labelled with known perfect disentangled latent
codes. As real datasets are not equipped with such labels, we propose an
unsupervised model selection scheme and show that it finds a model close to the
best one, for both VAEs and GANs. Combining contrastive regularization with
ModelCentrality, we improve upon the state-of-the-art disentanglement scores
significantly, without accessing the supervised data.

first-order expressive power is desirable for compactly representing actions
via schemas, and for specifying quantified conditions such as $\neg\exists
x\mathsf{blocks\_door}(x)$. In contrast, several recent epistemic planning
frameworks are built on propositional epistemic logic. The epistemic language
is useful to describe planning problems involving higher-order reasoning or
epistemic goals such as $K_{a}\neg\mathsf{problem}$.
  This paper develops a first-order version of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL).
In this framework, for example, $\exists xK_{x}\exists
y\mathsf{blocks\_door}(y)$ is a formula. The formalism combines the strengths
of DEL (higher-order reasoning) with those of first-order logic (lifted
representation) to model multi-agent epistemic planning. The paper introduces
an epistemic language with a possible-worlds semantics, followed by novel
dynamics given by first-order action models and their execution via product
updates. Taking advantage of the first-order machinery, epistemic action
schemas are defined to provide compact, problem-independent domain
descriptions, in the spirit of PDDL.
  Concerning metatheory, the paper defines axiomatic normal term-modal logics,
shows a Canonical Model Theorem-like result which allows establishing
completeness through frame characterization formulas, shows decidability for
the finite agent case, and shows a general completeness result for the dynamic

$\Omega_c\Omega_{cc} (sscscc)$, $\Omega_b\Omega_{bb} (ssbsbb)$ and
$\Omega_{ccb}\Omega_{cbb} (ccbcbb)$ are below their respective two-baryon
thresholds, suggesting the presence of bound states which are stable under
strong and electromagnetic interactions. We also predict their masses
precisely. For dibaryons $\Sigma_c\Xi_{cc} (uucucc)$, and $\Sigma_b\Xi_{bb}
(uububb)$, we could not reach to a definitive conclusion about the presence of
any bound state due to large systematics associated with these states. We also
find that the binding of these dibaryons becomes stronger as they become
heavier in mass. This study also opens up the possibility of the existence of
many other exotic nuclei, which can be formed through the fusion of heavy
baryons, similar to the formation of nuclei of elements in the Periodic Table.

of this approach is that abstract features incorporating several lesions and

Thus, the global context of the whole breast rather than individual lesions is

surrogate (T2*)-simultaneously and quantitatively in-vivo.
  Methods: 15 pregnant women were scanned on a 3T MR scanner. For perfusion
measurements, a velocity selective arterial spin labelling preparation module
was placed before a multi-echo gradient echo EPI readout to integrate T2* and
perfusion measurements in one joint perfusion-oxygenation (PERFOX) acquisition.
Joint motion correction and quantification were performed to evaluate changes
in T2* and perfusion over GA.
  Results: The optimised integrated PERFOX protocol and post-processing allowed
successful visualization and quantification of perfusion and T2* in all
subjects. Areas of high T2* and high perfusion appear to correspond to
placental sub-units and show a systematic offset in location along the
maternal-fetal axis. The areas of highest perfusion are consistently closer to
the maternal basal plate and the areas of highest T2* closer to the fetal
chorionic plate. Quantitative results show a strong negative correlation of
gestational age with T2* and weak negative correlation with perfusion.
  Conclusion: A strength of the joint sequence is that it provides truly
simultaneous and co-registered estimates of local T2* and perfusion, however,
to achieve this, the time per slice is prolonged compared to a perfusion only
scan which can potentially limit coverage. The achieved interlocking can be
particularly useful when quantifying transient physiological effects such as
uterine contractions. PERFOX opens a new avenue to elucidate the relationship
between maternal supply and oxygen uptake, both of which are central to
placental function and dysfunction.

further analyze their properties, showing there are cases where DirPG has an
exponentially larger probability of sampling informative gradients compared to

can be interpreted as controlling risk sensitivity. Empirically, we evaluate
the effect of key degrees of freedom and show that the algorithm performs well

obtain four classical Gray codes for permutations, bitstrings, binary trees and
set partitions as special cases. We present two distinct applications for our
new framework: The first main application is the generation of pattern-avoiding
permutations, yielding new Gray codes for different families of permutations
that are characterized by the avoidance of certain classical patterns,
(bi)vincular patterns, barred patterns, boxed patterns, Bruhat-restricted
patterns, mesh patterns, monotone and geometric grid classes, and many others.
We also obtain new Gray codes for all the combinatorial objects that are in
bijection to these permutations, in particular for five different types of
geometric rectangulations, also known as floorplans, which are divisions of a
square into $n$ rectangles subject to certain restrictions. The second main
application of our framework are lattice congruences of the weak order on the
symmetric group $S_n$. Recently, Pilaud and Santos realized all those lattice
congruences as $(n-1)$-dimensional polytopes, called quotientopes, which
generalize hypercubes, associahedra, permutahedra etc. Our algorithm generates
the equivalence classes of each of those lattice congruences, by producing a
Hamilton path on the skeleton of the corresponding quotientope, yielding a
constructive proof that each of these highly symmetric graphs is Hamiltonian.
We thus also obtain a provable notion of optimality for the Gray codes obtained

electrically driven OLEDs and optically excited films. In the same sample set
we also found molecular triplet excitons, which occurred only in PL experiments
under optical excitation and for some material systems only at low

states formed at the donor:acceptor interface are responsible for TADF in OLEDs
with distinct activation energies. Molecular (local) triplet exciton states are
also detectable, but only under optical excitation, while they are not found in
OLEDs when excited states are generated electrically. We believe that the
weakly bound emissive exciplex states and the strongly bound non-emissive

imperative to distinguish between optical and electrical generation paths as

evolved from classical pulsars in binary systems, where the rapid rotation is
caused by the accretion of matter and angular momentum from their companion.
During this transition between classical and millisecond pulsars, there is a
magnetic field reduction of around 4 orders of magnitude, which is not well
understood. According to the standard scenario, the magnetic field is reduced
as a consequence of accretion, either through ohmic dissipation or through
screening by the accreted matter. We explored an alternative hypothesis in
which the magnetic field is reduced through ambipolar diffusion before the
accretion. This is particularly effective during the long epoch in which the
pulsar has cooled, but has not yet started accreting. This makes the final
magnetic field dependent on the evolution time of the companion star and thus
its initial mass. We use observed binary systems to constrain the time
available for the magnetic field decay based on the current pulsar companion: a
helium white dwarf, a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, or another neutron star. Based
on a simplified model without baryon pairing, we show that the proposed process
agrees with the general distribution of observed magnetic field strengths in
binaries, but is not able to explain some mildly recycled pulsars where no
significant decay appears to have occurred. We discuss the possibility of other
formation channels for these systems and the conditions under which the
magnetic field evolution would be set by the neutron star crust rather than the
core.

reactions, it is not possible to determine which atom in the educt is mapped
onto which atom in the product. Trying out all possible atomic index mappings
is not feasible because of the factorial increase in the number of possible
mappings. By using a penalty function that is invariant under index
permutations, we can bias the potential energy surface in such a way that it
obtains the characteristics of a structure seeker whose global minimum is the
product. By performing a Minima Hopping based global optimization on this
biased potential energy surface we can rapidly find intermediate states that
lead into the global minimum. Based on this information we can then extract the
full reaction pathway. We first demonstrate for a benchmark system, namely LJ38
that our method allows to preferentially find intermediate states that are
relevant for the lowest energy reaction pathway and that we, therefore, need a
much smaller number of intermediate states than previous methods to find the
lowest energy reaction pathway. Finally, we apply the method to two real

valuable information on how the system can be synthesized.

self-potential (SP) method, a passive electrical geophysical method, is used to
characterize water flow in situ. Unlike tensiometers, which use a measurement
of state (i.e. matric pressure) at two locations to infer fluid flow, the SP
method directly measures signals generated by water movement. We collected SP
measurements in a two-dimensional array at the base of a Douglas-fir tree
(Pseudotsuga menziesii) in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in western
Oregon over five months to provide insight on the propagation of transpiration
signals into the subsurface under variable soil moisture. During dry
conditions, SP data appear to show downward unsaturated flow, while nearby
tensiometer data appear to suggest upward flow during this period. After the
trees enter dormancy in the fall, precipitation-induced vertical flow dominates
in the SP and tensiometer data. Diel variations in SP data correspond to
periods of tree transpiration. Changes in volumetric water content occurring
from soil moisture movement during transpiration are not large enough to appear
in volumetric water content data. Fluid flow and electrokinetic coupling (i.e.
electrical potential distribution) were simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics to
explore the system controls on field data. The coupled model, which included a
root-water uptake term, reproduced components of both the long-term and diel
variations in SP measurements, thus indicating that SP has potential to provide
spatially and temporally dense measurements of transpiration-induced changes in
water flow. This manuscript presents the first SP measurements focusing on the

change in the metric during the passage of a strong neutrino flux through the
detector. Such an impact on the detector is possible, in particular, in
extended scalar-tensor theories in which the local matter density gradient
affects the gravitational force. The first short neutrino pulse emitted at the
initial stage of stellar core collapse before the onset of neutrino opacity
could exert a major influence on the detector by exiting the detector response
at the main resonance frequency. In contrast, the influence of the subsequent
broad pulse (with a duration of several seconds) in the resonant detector is
exponentially suppressed, despite the fact that the second pulse carries an
order-of-magnitude more neutrino energy, and it could generate a signal in the
LSD neutrino detector. This explains the time delay of 1.4s between the Geograv
and LSD signals. The consequences of this effect of modified gravity for
LIGO/Virgo observations are discussed.

a certain issue can change his opinion due to social influence. We consider
anonymous influence, which depends on the number of agents having a certain
opinion, but not on their identity. An individual is conformist/anti-conformist
if his probability of saying `yes' increases/decreases with the number of
`yes'-agents. We focus on three classes of aggregation rules (pure conformism,
pure anti-conformism, and mixed aggregation rules) and examine two types of
society (without, and with mixed agents). For both types we provide a complete
qualitative analysis of convergence, i.e., identify all absorbing classes and
conditions for their occurrence. Also the pure case with infinitely many
individuals is studied. We show that, as expected, the presence of
anti-conformists in a society brings polarization and instability: polarization
in two groups, fuzzy polarization (i.e., with blurred frontiers), cycles,
periodic classes, as well as more or less chaotic situations where at any time
step the set of `yes'-agents can be any subset of the society. Surprisingly,
the presence of anti-conformists may also lead to opinion reversal: a majority
group of conformists with a stable opinion can evolve by a cascade phenomenon
towards the opposite opinion, and remains in this state.

across many social science areas, especially in psychology. New technologies
like smart-phones, fitness trackers, and the Internet of Things make it much
easier than in the past for data collection in intensive longitudinal studies,
providing an opportunity to look deep into the underlying characteristics of
individuals under a high temporal resolution. In this paper, we introduce a new
modeling framework for latent curve analysis that is more suitable for the
analysis of intensive longitudinal data than existing latent curve models.
Specifically, through the modeling of an individual-specific continuous-time
latent process, some unique features of intensive longitudinal data are better
captured, including intensive measurements in time and unequally spaced time
points of observations. Technically, the continuous-time latent process is
modeled by a Gaussian process model. This model can be regarded as a
semi-parametric extension of the classical latent curve models and falls under
the framework of structural equation modeling. Procedures for parameter
estimation and statistical inference are provided under an empirical Bayes
framework and evaluated by simulation studies. We illustrate the use of the
proposed model through the analysis of an ecological momentary assessment
dataset.

modulating the frequency of the laser pumping the OPA, we find two interesting

Moreover, the optomechanical entanglement shows a second-order transition

of normal mode splitting comes up in the laser detuning dependence of

energy, which traces the Universe evolution from the very early quantum era to
the present time. Here we perform a high-redshift analysis to check if this new
model is compatible with present day observational data and compare predictions
of this model with that of the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. In our
analysis we use only the most reliable observational data, namely the distances
to selected SNIa, GRB Hubble diagram, and $28$ direct measurements of the
Hubble constant. Moreover we consider also non {\it geometric} data related to
the growth rate of density perturbations. We explore the probability
distributions of the cosmological parameters for both models. To build up their
own regions of confidence, we maximize the appropriate likelihood functions
using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Our statistical analysis
indicates that these very different models of dark energy are compatible with
present day observational data and the GPS model seems slightly favored with
respect to the $\Lambda$CDM model. However to further restrict different models
of dark energy it will be necessary to increase the precision of the Hubble
diagram at high redshifts and to perform more detailed analysis of the
influence of dark energy on the process of formation of large scale structure.

use an approximate (and fast) gravity solver to generate $300$ dark matter

both calibrated from the arbitrarily chosen realisation of the reference

However, we observe that most of the existing strategies to design compact

this work, we rigorously study the extension of network pruning strategies to
preserve both benign accuracy and robustness of a network. Starting with a
formal definition of the pruning procedure, including pre-training, weights
pruning, and fine-tuning, we propose a new pruning method that can create
compact networks while preserving both benign accuracy and robustness. Our
method is based on two main insights: (1) we ensure that the training
objectives of the pre-training and fine-tuning steps match the training
objective of the desired robust model (e.g., adversarial robustness/verifiable
robustness), and (2) we keep the pruning strategy agnostic to pre-training and
fine-tuning objectives. We evaluate our method on four different networks on
the CIFAR-10 dataset and measure benign accuracy, empirical robust accuracy,
and verifiable robust accuracy. We demonstrate that our pruning method can
preserve on average 93\% benign accuracy, 92.5\% empirical robust accuracy, and
85.0\% verifiable robust accuracy while compressing the tested network by

the instabilities develop more slowly as the rotation frequency increases, and

feasible.

the nature of the $X(3872)$ meson has been one of the main priorities in the
field of quarkonium physics. Not qualifying as a conventional $c\bar{c}$ state,
the multiquark structure of this exotic meson has received very different
interpretations, ranging from a compact tetraquark configuration to an extended
$D\bar D^*+c.c.$ molecule. In this work we explore the effect that a hot pion
bath may have in the properties of the $X(3872)$, assuming this state to be a
$D\bar D^*+c.c.$ molecule. We derive the finite temperature effects on the
$X(3872)$ from a coupled channels unitarized amplitude, obtained including the
properties of the charmed mesons under such conditions. We find that the
$X(3872)$ develops a subtantial width, of the order of a few tens of MeV, in
hot pionic environments at temperatures $100-150$ MeV, and its nominal mass
moves above the $D D^*$ threshold. The fact that the $X(3872)$ in a hot pion
gas may no longer be a narrow resonance needs to be considered in the
estimation of production yields in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

builds confidence in using these datasets and in particular the most-recent

constructing such simplicial representations. The lazy witness complex is a

$\epsilon$-cover to define $\epsilon$-net. We prove that $\epsilon$-net, as a
choice of landmarks, is an $\epsilon$-approximate representation of the point

Jupiter observed by Suzaku. In 2006 Suzaku had found diffuse X-ray emission in
$1\unicode{x2013}5$ keV associated with Jovian inner radiation belts. It has
been suggested that the emission is caused by the inverse-Compton scattering by
ultra-relativistic electrons ($ \sim 50 $ MeV) in Jupiter's magnetosphere. To
confirm the existence of this emission and to understand its relation to the
solar activity, we conducted an additional Suzaku observation in 2014 around
the maximum of the 24th solar cycle. As a result, we successfully found again
the diffuse emission around Jupiter in $1\unicode{x2013}5$ keV and also
point-like emission in $0.4\unicode{x2013}1$ keV. The luminosity of the
point-like emission which was probably composed of solar X-ray scattering,
charge exchange, or auroral bremsstrahlung emission increased by a factor of $
\sim 5$ with respect to 2006, most likely due to an increase of the solar
activity. The diffuse emission spectrum in the $1\unicode{x2013}5$ keV band was
well-fitted with a flat power-law function ($ \Gamma = 1.4 \pm 0.1 $) as in the
past observation, which supported the inverse-Compton scattering hypothesis.
However, its spatial distribution changed from $ \sim 12 \times 4 $ Jovian
radius (Rj) to $ \sim 20 \times 7 $ Rj. The luminosity of the diffuse emission
increased by a smaller factor of $ \sim 3 $. This indicates that the diffuse
emission is not simply responding to the solar activity, which is also known to
cause little effect on the distribution of high-energy electrons around
Jupiter. Further sensitive study of the spatial and spectral distributions of
the diffuse hard X-ray emission is important to understand how high-energy
particles are accelerated in Jupiter's magnetosphere.

among their host galaxies as suggested by most interpretations of the
$\Lambda$CDM model. One type of anisotropy recently detected in the SDSS (and
seen when examining the distribution of satellites in the Local Group and in
the Centaurus group) is a tendency to be so-called ""lopsided"". Namely, in pairs
of galaxies (like Andromeda and the Milky Way) the satellites are more likely
to inhabit the region in between the pair, rather than on opposing sides.
Although recent studies found a similar set up when comparing pairs of galaxies
in $\Lambda$CDM simulations indicating that such a set up is not inconsistent
with $\Lambda$CDM, the origin has yet to be explained. Here we examine the
origin of such lopsided setups by first identifying such distributions in pairs
of galaxies in numerical cosmological simulations, and then tracking back the
orbital trajectories of satellites (which at $z=0$ display the effect). We
report two main results: first, the lopsided distribution was stronger in the
past and weakens towards $z=0$. Second, the weakening of the signal is due to
the interaction of satellite galaxies with the pair. Finally, we show that the
$z=0$ signal is driven primarily by satellites that are on first approach, who
have yet to experience a ""flyby"". This suggests that the signal seen in the
observations is also dominated by dynamically young accretion events.

Straightforward analyses of cosmological $N$-body simulations imply that the
$\Lambda$CDM model predicts an overabundance of low circular velocity galaxies
when compared to observed HI velocity functions. More nuanced analyses that
account for the relationship between galaxies and their host haloes suggest
that how we model the influence of baryonic processes has a significant impact
on HI velocity function predictions. We explore this in detail by modelling HI
emission lines of galaxies in the SHARK semi-analytic galaxy formation model,
built on the SURFS suite of $\Lambda$CDM $N$-body simulations. We create a
simulated ALFALFA survey, in which we apply the survey selection function and
account for effects such as beam confusion, and compare simulated and observed
HI velocity width distributions, finding differences of $\lesssim 50$%, orders
of magnitude smaller than the discrepancies reported in the past. This is a
direct consequence of our careful treatment of survey selection effects and,
importantly, how we model the relationship between galaxy and halo circular
velocity - the HI mass-maximum circular velocity relation of galaxies is
characterised by a large scatter. These biases are complex enough that building
a velocity function from the observed HI line widths cannot be done reliably.

dark matter density $\rho_{{\rm DM},\odot}$. However, the estimates are subject
to the choice of the distribution of baryons needed in this type of studies. In
this work we explore several Galactic mass models that differ in the
distribution of baryons and dark matter, in order to determine $\rho_{{\rm
DM},\odot}$. For this purpose we analyze the precise circular velocity curve
measurement of the Milky Way up to $\sim 25$ kpc from the Galactic centre
obtained from Gaia DR2 [1]. We find that the estimated value of $\rho_{{\rm
DM},\odot}$ stays robust to reasonable changes in the spherical dark matter
halo. However, we show that $\rho_{{\rm DM},\odot}$ is affected by the choice
of the model for the underlying baryonic components. In particular, we find
that $\rho_{{\rm DM},\odot}$ is mostly sensitive to uncertainties in the disk
components of the Galaxy. We also show that, when choosing one particular
baryonic model, the estimate of $\rho_{{\rm DM},\odot}$ has an uncertainty of
only about $10\%$ of its best-fit value, but this uncertainty gets much bigger
when we also consider the variation of the baryonic model. In particular, the
rotation curve method does not allow to exclude the presence of an additional
very thin component, that can increase $\rho_{{\rm DM},\odot}$ by more than a
factor of 8 (the thin disk could even be made of dark matter). Therefore, we
conclude that exclusively using the rotation curve of the Galaxy is not enough
to provide a robust estimate of $\rho_{{\rm DM},\odot}$. For all the models
that we study without the presence of an additional thin component, our
resulting estimates of the local dark matter density take values in the range
$\rho_{{\rm DM},\odot} \simeq \text{0.3--0.4}\,\mathrm{GeV/cm^3}$, consistent
with many of the estimates in the literature.

clustering. At the center of the method lies the comparison of subsequences. To
achieve this, they first get assigned to their Hidden Markov Models using the
Baum-Welch algorithm. Next, those models are described by an approximating
representation of the probability distributions they define. Finally, this
representation is then analyzed with the help of some clustering technique or
other outlier detection tool and anomalies are detected. Clearly, HMMs could be
substituted by some other appropriate model, e.g. some other dynamic Bayesian
network. Our learning algorithm is unsupervised, so it does not require the
labeling of large amounts of data. The usability of this method is demonstrated
by applying it to synthetic and real-world syslog data.

drawback with this certificate lies in its realization dependency. Firstly,
computing such a realization requires to find a polyhedral cone with a

state-space representation, significantly. Secondly, not all externally
positive systems posses an internally positive realization. Thirdly, in many
typical applications such as controller design, system identification and model
order reduction, internal positivity is not preserved. To overcome these
drawbacks, we present a tractable sufficient certificate of external positivity
based on second-order cones. This certificate does not require any special
state-space realization: if it succeeds with a possibly non-minimal
realization, then it will do so with any minimal realization. While there exist
systems where this certificate is also necessary, we also demonstrate how to
construct systems, where both second-order and polyhedral cones as well as
other certificates fail. Nonetheless, in contrast to other realization
independent certificates, the present one appears to be favourable in terms of
applicability and conservatism. Three applications are representatively
discussed to underline its potential. We show how the certificate can be used
to find externally positive approximations of nearly externally positive
systems and demonstrated that this may help to reduce system identification
errors. The same algorithm is used then to design state-feedback controllers
that provide closed-loop external positivity, a common approach to avoid over-
and undershooting of the step response. Lastly, we present modifications to
generalized balanced truncation such that external positivity is preserved

the challenges related to climate change. Cities, with their complex urban
texture and fabric can be represented as a diverse ecosystem that do not have a
clear and defined boundary. Multiple tools that have been developed, in the
recent years, for assessment of urban climate, building energy demand, the
outdoor thermal comfort and the energy systems. In this review, we, however,
noted that these tools often address only one or two of these urban planning
aspects. There is however an intricate link between them. For instance, the
outdoor comfort assessment has showed that there is a strong link between
biometeorology and architecture and urban climate. Additionally, to address the
challenges of the energy transition, there will be a convergence of the energy
needs in the future with an energy nexus regrouping the energy demand of urban
areas. It is also highlighted that the uncertainty related to future climatic
data makes urban adaptation and mitigation strategies complex to implement and
to design given the lack of a comprehensive framework. We thus conclude by
suggesting the need for a holistic interface to take into account this
multi-dimensional problem. With the help of such a platform a positive loop in

  In this paper, we focus on the class of planar polygonal rigid robots with
arbitrarily complex geometry. We exploit the remarkable decomposability
property of soft collision-detection predicates of such robots. We introduce a
general technique to produce such a decomposition. If the robot is an m-gon,
the complexity of this approach scales linearly in m. This contrasts with the
O(m^3) complexity known for exact planners. It follows that we can now
routinely produce soft predicates for any rigid polygonal robot. This results
in resolution-exact planners for such robots within the general Soft
Subdivision Search (SSS) framework. This is a significant advancement in the
theory of sound and complete planners for planar robots.
  We implemented such decomposed predicates in our open-source Core Library.

detail at high angular resolution (~0.35 arcsec) using ALMA. This high
resolution makes it possible to separate the emission associated with the inner
hot envelope and disk around the forming star from that of its cool outer
envelope. In addition, the high sensitivity of ALMA makes it possible to
identify weak and optically thin lines and allows for many isotopologues to be
detected, providing a more complete and accurate inventory of the source. A
total of 23 different molecular species and their isotopologues are detected in
the spectrum towards AFGL 4176. The most abundant species is methanol (CH3OH),
remaining species are present at levels between 0.003 % and 15 % with respect
to CH3OH. Hints that N-bearing species peak slightly closer to the location of
the peak continuum emission than the O-bearing species are seen. AFGL 4176
comprises a rich chemical inventory including many complex species present on
disk-scales. On average, the derived column density ratios with respect to
methanol of O-bearing species are higher than those derived for N-bearing
species by a factor of three. This may indicate that AFGL 4176 is a relatively
young source since nitrogen chemistry generally takes longer to evolve in the
gas-phase. Taking methanol as a reference, the composition of AFGL 4176 more
closely resembles that of the low-mass protostar IRAS 16293-2422B than that of
high-mass star-forming regions located near the Galactic centre. This
similarity hints that the chemical composition of complex species is already

chemical composition has not yet been strongly processed by the central

tip-enhancement and plasmonic enhancement, laser-induced field emission is
realized over large, dense and highly uniform field emitter arrays. The
theoretical principles of these field emitter arrays are studied and their

including ultrafast single-cycle THz guns and segmented THz electron
accelerator and manipulator (STEAM) devices are developed and tested. The
possibility of using transient fields to realize ultrahigh acceleration
gradients close to 0.5 GeV/m is confirmed. Specifically, a STEAM device capable
of performing multiple high-field operations on the 6D-phase-space of
ultrashort electron bunches is demonstrated. With this single device, powered

THz-acceleration of >30 keV, streaking with <10fs resolution, focusing with >2
kT/m strength, compression to ~ 100 fs as well as real-time switching between

optically-generated THz pulses is demonstrated. Moreover, the possibility of
electron acceleration to tens of MeV with millijoule level THz pulses is
theoretically shown. The final goal of the above studies is a fully THz-driven

induce apparent oscillations of physical constants in time, while the passage
of macroscopic dark-matter objects (such as topological defects) may induce
apparent transient variations in the physical constants. In this paper, we
point out several new signatures of the aforementioned types of dark matter
that can arise due to the geometric asymmetry created by the beam-splitter in a
two-arm laser interferometer. These new signatures include dark-matter-induced
time-varying size changes of a freely-suspended beam-splitter and associated
time-varying shifts of the main reflecting surface of the beam-splitter that
splits and recombines the laser beam, as well as time-varying refractive-index
changes in the freely-suspended beam-splitter and time-varying size changes of
freely-suspended arm mirrors. We demonstrate that existing ground-based
experiments already have sufficient sensitivity to probe extensive regions of
unconstrained parameter space in models involving oscillating scalar
dark-matter fields and domain walls composed of scalar fields. In the case of
oscillating dark-matter fields, Michelson interferometers $-$ in particular,
the GEO600 detector $-$ are especially sensitive. The sensitivity of
Fabry-Perot-Michelson interferometers, including LIGO, VIRGO and KAGRA, to
oscillating dark-matter fields can be significantly increased by making the
thicknesses of the freely-suspended Fabry-Perot arm mirrors different in the
two arms. We also discuss how small-scale Michelson interferometers, such as

in many computer vision applications. Classical methods for these tasks are
based on a detect-then-describe paradigm where separate handcrafted methods are
used to first identify repeatable keypoints and then represent them with a
local descriptor. Neural networks trained with metric learning losses have
recently caught up with these techniques, focusing on learning repeatable
saliency maps for keypoint detection and learning descriptors at the detected
keypoint locations. In this work, we argue that salient regions are not
necessarily discriminative, and therefore can harm the performance of the
description. Furthermore, we claim that descriptors should be learned only in
regions for which matching can be performed with high confidence. We thus
propose to jointly learn keypoint detection and description together with a
predictor of the local descriptor discriminativeness. This allows us to avoid
ambiguous areas and leads to reliable keypoint detections and descriptions. Our
detection-and-description approach, trained with self-supervision, can
simultaneously output sparse, repeatable and reliable keypoints that

  Emotion Estimation","IEEE CVPR 2020",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV eess.IV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Training deep neural networks with spatio-temporal (i.e., 3D) or
multidimensional convolutions of higher-order is computationally challenging
due to millions of unknown parameters across dozens of layers. To alleviate
this, one approach is to apply low-rank tensor decompositions to convolution
kernels in order to compress the network and reduce its number of parameters.
Alternatively, new convolutional blocks, such as MobileNet, can be directly
designed for efficiency. In this paper, we unify these two approaches by
proposing a tensor factorization framework for efficient multidimensional
(separable) convolutions of higher-order. Interestingly, the proposed framework
enables a novel higher-order transduction, allowing to train a network on a
given domain (e.g., 2D images or N-dimensional data in general) and using
transduction to generalize to higher-order data such as videos (or
(N+K)-dimensional data in general), capturing for instance temporal dynamics
while preserving the learnt spatial information.
  We apply the proposed methodology, coined CP-Higher-Order Convolution
(HO-CPConv), to spatio-temporal facial emotion analysis. Most existing facial
affect models focus on static imagery and discard all temporal information.
This is due to the above-mentioned burden of training 3D convolutional nets and
the lack of large bodies of video data annotated by experts. We address both
issues with our proposed framework. Initial training is first done on static
imagery before using transduction to generalize to the temporal domain. We
demonstrate superior performance on three challenging large scale affect
estimation datasets, AffectNet, SEWA, and AFEW-VA.

  Convection from Two Horizontally Aligned Square Cylinders","Original Research Work",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Laminar natural convection heat transfer from two horizontally aligned square
cylinders has been investigated numerically using a finite-volume method (FVM)
approach. Computations were performed to delineate the momentum and heat
transfer characteristics under the following ranges of parameters: horizontal
spacing between the cylinders (0 <= S/W <= 10), tilt angle of the square
cylinder (0^0 <= {\delta} <= 60^0), and Grashof number (10 <= Gr <= 10^5) for
some specific Newtonian fluids having Prandtl number (0.71 <= Pr <= 7). The
comprehensive results are represented in terms of temperature contours and
streamlines, velocity and temperature profiles, the mass flow rate in the
passage between the cylinders, local and average Nu, and the drag coefficient.
Owing to the development of a chimney effect, the heat transfer increases with
decrease in the horizontal spacing up to a certain limit, whereas it
significantly degrades with a further decrease in the spacing. The square
cylinder having {\delta} = 45^0 shows a higher heat transfer, whereas it is
least for {\delta} = 0^0. At higher Gr and Pr, the average Nu is found to be in
excess of 22% at {\delta} = 45^0 compared to at {\delta} = 0^0. Overall, the
average Nu has a strong dependence on both Gr and Pr, whereas it is a weak
function of S/W and {\delta}. Furthermore, the entropy generation is reproduced
non-dimensionally in terms of the Bejan number. Finally, a correlation for the
average Nu has been developed, which can be useful for the engineering
calculations.

Cahn-Hilliard type equations are preferred for immiscible mixtures, whereby
different assumptions on the coupling of fluxes lead to the slow-mode and

imaging technique whereby the sample is placed directly onto or very close to
the digital sensor, and illuminated by a partially coherent source located far
above it. The scattered object wave interferes with the reference (unscattered)
wave at the plane where a digital sensor is situated, producing a digital
hologram that can be processed in several ways to extract and numerically
reconstruct an in-focus image using the back propagation algorithm. Without
requiring any lenses and other intermediate optical components, the LFOCDHM has
unique advantages of offering a large effective numerical aperture (NA) close
to unity across the native wide field-of-view (FOV) of the imaging sensor in a
cost-effective and compact design. However, unlike conventional coherent
diffraction limited imaging systems, where the limiting aperture is used to
define the system performance, typical lens-free microscopes only produce
compromised imaging resolution that far below the ideal coherent diffraction
limit. At least five major factors may contribute to this limitation, namely,
the sample-to-sensor distance, spatial and temporal coherence of the
illumination, finite size of the equally spaced sensor pixels, and finite
extent of the image sub-FOV used for the reconstruction, which have not been
systematically and rigorously explored until now. In this work, we derive five
transfer function models that account for all these physical effects and
interactions of these models on the imaging resolution of LFOCDHM. We also
examine how our theoretical models can be utilized to optimize the optical
design or predict the theoretical resolution limit of a given LFOCDHM system.
We present a series of simulations and experiments to confirm the validity of
our theoretical models.

design, state-of-the-art technologies adopted, and various engineering details
in the INFv system. We also carefully study the deployment configurations by
investigating over 20K Google Play apps, as well as thorough evaluations with
realistic settings. In addition to a significant improvement in battery life
(up to 6.9x energy reduction) and execution time (up to 4x faster), INFv has
two distinct advantages over previous systems: 1) a non-intrusive offloading
mechanism transparent to existing apps; 2) an inherent framework support to
effectively balance computation load and exploit the proximity of in-network
resources. Both advantages together enable a scalable and incremental
deployment of computation offloading framework in practical ISPs' networks.

$v_p$ are the basis of plasma-based electron accelerators. For such

amplitude and the corresponding energy gained by electrons trapped in the wave
field. Here we show that these properties and the general waveform are obtained
with little mathematical complexity by using a Lorentz transformation to a

second-order ordinary differential equation as originally found by Chian
[Plasma Phys. \textbf{21}, 509 (1979)] so that the analysis can exploit the
analogy with the mechanical motion of a particle in a potential well. This

structured numerical data from collider events to a few statistical summaries
is a common task. The data processing is typically more complex than standard
query languages allow, such that custom numerical codes are used. At present,
these codes mostly operate on individual event records and are parallelized in
multi-step data reduction workflows using batch jobs across CPU farms. Based on
a simplified top quark pair analysis with CMS Open Data, we demonstrate that it
is possible to carry out significant parts of a collider analysis at a rate of
around a million events per second on a single multicore server with optional
GPU acceleration. This is achieved by representing HEP event data as
memory-mappable sparse arrays of columns, and by expressing common analysis
operations as kernels that can be used to process the event data in parallel.
We find that only a small number of relatively simple functional kernels are
needed for a generic HEP analysis. The approach based on columnar processing of
data could speed up and simplify the cycle for delivering physics results at
HEP experiments. We release the \texttt{hepaccelerate} prototype library as a
demonstrator of such methods.

that transverse instabilities of the pump further affect the emitted THz field
along nonlinear propagation, which produces additional singularities resulting
in a rich vortex structure. The predicted intensity modulation is
experimentally demonstrated with a thermal camera, in excellent agreement with

revealed by astigmatic transformation of the beam using a cylindrical mirror.

and compared with our previous H$\alpha$-based study at matched spatial
resolution. One target is marginally resolved in CO(2-1), showing complex
dynamics with respect to the ionised gas traced by H$\alpha$. While the other
source is spatially resolved, enabling a detailed exploration of its internal
dynamical properties. In this system, both gaseous phases show similar spatial
extension, rotation velocities and velocity dispersions ($V_{\rm rot} \sim
\sigma_v \sim 100$\,km\,s$^{-1}$) suggesting a rotational velocity to velocity
dispersion ratio consistent with unity. By comparing the ionized and molecular

is often used to determine the unknown parameters describing rupture, but
running many simulations usually requires human review to determine how to
adjust parameter values and is thus not very efficient. To reduce the
computational cost and improve our ability to determine reasonable stress and
friction parameters, we take advantage of the machine learning approach. We
develop two models for earthquake rupture propagation using the artificial

rupture can break a geometric heterogeneity on a fault. We train the models
using a database of 1600 dynamic rupture simulations computed numerically.
Fault geometry, stress conditions, and friction parameters vary in each
simulation. We cross-validate and test the predictive power of the models using
an additional 400 simulated ruptures, respectively. Both RF and ANN models
predict rupture propagation with more than 81% accuracy, and model parameters
can be used to infer the underlying factors most important for rupture
propagation. Both of the models are computationally efficient such that the 400
testings require a fraction of a second, leading to potential applications of
dynamic rupture that have previously not been possible due to the computational
demands of physics-based rupture simulations.

and its propagation characteristics in a magnetized rf discharge plasma. The
DAWs are spontaneously excited in dusty plasma after adding more particles in
the confining potential well and found to propagate in the direction of
streaming ions. The spontaneous excitation of such low-frequency modes is
possible due to the instabilities associated with streaming ions through the
dust grain medium. The background E-field and neutral pressure determine the
stability of excited DAWs. The characteristics of DAWs strongly depend on the
strength of external magnetic field. The magnetic field of strength B $<$ 0.05
T only modifies the characteristics of propagating waves in dusty plasma at
moderate power and pressure, P = 3.5 W and p = 27 Pa respectively. It is found
that DAWs start to be damped with increasing the magnetic field beyond B $>$
0.05 T and get completely damped at higher magnetic field B $\sim$ 0.13 T.
After lowering the power and pressure to 3 W and 23 Pa respectively, the
excited DAWs in the absence of B are slightly unstable. In this case, the
magnetic field only stabilizes and modifies the propagation characteristics of
DAWs while the strength of B is increased up to 0.1 T or even higher. The
modification of the sheath electric field where particles are confined in the
presence of the external magnetic field is the main cause of the modification

the success of any data-intensive solution relies on the quality of data that
drives it. Among vast amount of data that are captured, managed, and analyzed
everyday, geospatial data are one of the most interesting class of data that
hold geographical information of real-world phenomena and can be visualized as
digital maps. Geo-spatial data is the source of many enterprise solutions that
provide local information and insights. In order to increase the quality of
such solutions, companies continuously aggregate geospatial datasets from
various sources. However, lack of a global standard model for geospatial
datasets makes the task of merging and integrating datasets difficult and
error-prone. Traditionally, domain experts manually validate the data
integration process by merging new data sources and/or new versions of previous
data against conflicts and other requirement violations. However, this approach
is not scalable and is hinder toward rapid release, when dealing with
frequently changing big datasets. Thus more automated approaches with limited
interaction with domain experts is required. As a first step to tackle this
problem, in this paper, we leverage Information Retrieval (IR) and geospatial
search techniques to propose a systematic and automated conflict identification
approach. To evaluate our approach, we conduct a case study in which we measure
the accuracy of our approach in several real-world scenarios and we interview
with software developers at Localintel Inc. (our industry partner) to get their
feedbacks.

The next processing steps are then performed based on the rewritten utterance.
To properly train the utterance rewriter, we collect a new dataset with human

profound effects on the resulting eco-evolutionary dynamics. Incorporating
linear environmental feedback law into replicator dynamics of two-player games,
recent theoretical studies shed light on understanding the oscillating dynamics
of social dilemma. However, detailed effects of more general nonlinear feedback
loops in multi-player games, which is more common especially in microbial
systems, remain unclear. Here, we focus on ecological public goods games with
environmental feedbacks driven by nonlinear selection gradient. Unlike previous
models, multiple segments of stable and unstable equilibrium manifolds can
emerge from the population dynamical systems. We find that a larger relative
asymmetrical feedback speed for group interactions centered on cooperators not
only accelerates the convergence of stable manifolds, but also increases the
attraction basin of these stable manifolds. Furthermore, our work offers an
innovative manifold control approach: by designing appropriate switching
control laws, we are able to steer the eco-evolutionary dynamics to any desired
population states. Our mathematical framework is an important generalization
and complement to coevolutionary game dynamics, and also fills the theoretical
gap in guiding the widespread problem of population state control in microbial

(IoT) technology. In WSN, field sensing and fusion are the most commonly seen
problems, which involve collecting and processing of a huge volume of spatial
samples in an unknown field to reconstruct the field or extract its features.
One of the major concerns is how to reduce the communication overhead and data
redundancy with prescribed fusion accuracy. In this paper, an integrated
communication and computation framework based on meta-learning is proposed to
enable adaptive field sensing and reconstruction. It consists of a
stochastic-gradient-descent (SGD) based base-learner used for the field model
prediction aiming to minimize the average prediction error, and a reinforcement
meta-learner aiming to optimize the sensing decision by simultaneously
rewarding the error reduction with samples obtained so far and penalizing the
corresponding communication cost. An adaptive sensing algorithm based on the
above two-layer meta-learning framework is presented. It actively determines
the next most informative sensing location, and thus considerably reduces the
spatial samples and yields superior performance and robustness compared with
conventional schemes. The convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm is
also comprehensively analyzed and simulated. The results reveal that the
proposed field sensing algorithm significantly improves the convergence rate.

such as axle counters and track balises. This system has proven itself to be
reliable, however, it is not very efficient and, moreover, very costly. Thus,
it is not suited to overcome the future challenges in railway transportation.
For this reason, signalling systems based on train-borne sensors have gained
interest recently. In this context, train-borne localization is one of the main
research challenges. So far there is no sensor set-up which meets the demanding
requirements for a localization system, both in the sense of accuracy as well
as safety. To help overcome these issues in the near future we present our
latest research results here. Earlier we published a localization algorithm
which is characterized by an increased accuracy in cross-track direction
compared to a standard Kalman filter (KF) approach, as has been shown in
simulations [1]. To verify these results practically, we recorded data from a
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and an inertial measurement unit
(IMU) on a test drive. The localization accuracy is evaluated with the help of
OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and site plans. Furthermore, we evaluate the quality

  Coordination of Distribution Networks with Embedded DG","6 pages, 11 figures, 12 tables, published in a conference",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed Generation (DG) has emerged as best alternative to conventional
energy sources in recent times. Decentralization of power generation,
improvement in voltage profile and reduction of system losses are some of key
benefits of DG integration into the grid. However, introduction of DG changes
the radial nature of a distribution network (DN) and may affect both magnitude
and direction of fault currents. This phenomenon may have severe repercussions
for the reliability and safety of a DN including protection coordination
failure. This paper investigates the impact of DG on protection coordination of
a typical DN and proposes a scheme to restore the protection coordination in
presence of DG. Moreover, impact of different DG sizes and locations on DN's
voltage profile and losses has also been analyzed. The sample DN with embedded
DG is modelled in ETAP environment and the simulation results presented show
the effectiveness of the proposed protection strategy in restoring relay
coordination of the network in both isolated and DG connected modes of
operation.

role in the lives of the population. In India, around 80\% of the population
depend on agriculture or its by-products as the primary means for employment.
Given large population dependency on agriculture, it becomes extremely
important for the government to estimate market factors in advance and prepare
for any deviation from those estimates. Commodity arrivals to market is an
extremely important factor which is captured at district level throughout the
country. Historical data and short-term prediction of important variables such
as arrivals, prices, crop quality etc. for commodities are used by the
government to take proactive steps and decide various policy measures.
  In this paper, we present a framework to work with short timeseries in
conjunction with remote sensing data to predict future commodity arrivals. We
deal with extremely high dimensional data which exceed the observation sizes by
multiple orders of magnitude. We use cascaded layers of dimensionality
reduction techniques combined with regularized regression models for
prediction. We present results to predict arrivals to major markets and state
wide prices for `Tur' (red gram) crop in Karnataka, India. Our model
consistently beats popular ML techniques on many instances. Our model is
scalable, time efficient and can be generalized to many other crops and
regions. We draw multiple insights from the regression parameters, some of
which are important aspects to consider when predicting more complex quantities
such as prices in the future. We also combine the insights to generate
important recommendations for different government organizations.

massive delays, and less productivity. On the other hand, it has a negative
impact on the commuters feelings and moods. Availability of real-time transit
information - by providing public transportation vehicles locations using GPS
devices - helps in estimating a passenger's waiting time and addressing the
above issues. However, such solution is expensive for developing countries.
This paper aims at designing and implementing a crowd-sourced mobile
phones-based solution to estimate the expected waiting time of a passenger in
public transit systems, the prediction of the remaining time to get on/off a
vehicle, and to construct a real time public transit schedule. Trans-Sense has
been evaluated using real data collected for over 800 hours, on a daily basis,
by different Android phones, and using different light rail transit lines at
different time spans. The results show that Trans-Sense can achieve an average
recall and precision of 95.35% and 90.1%, respectively, in discriminating
lightrail stations. Moreover, the empirical distributions governing the
different time delays affecting a passenger's total trip time enable predicting
the right time of arrival of a passenger to her destination with an accuracy of
91.81%.In addition, the system estimates the stations dimensions with an

this impressive overall effectiveness belies a substantial missed opportunity
in single-threaded instructions per cycle (IPC). For example, we show that
correcting the mispredictions made by the state-of-the-art TAGE-SC-L branch
predictor on SPECint 2017 would improve IPC by margins similar to an advance in

  In this work, we measure and characterize these mispredictions. We find that
they categorically arise from either (1) a small number of systematically
hard-to-predict (H2P) branches; or (2) rare branches with low dynamic execution
counts. Using data from SPECint 2017 and additional large code footprint
applications, we quantify the occurrence and IPC impact of these two
categories. We then demonstrate that increasing the resources afforded to
existing branch predictors does not alone address the root causes of most
mispredictions. This leads us to reexamine basic assumptions in branch
prediction and to propose new research directions that, for example, deploy
machine learning to improve pattern matching for H2Ps, and use on-chip phase
learning to track long-term statistics for rare branches.

for large-scale data sets are visual clutter and overplotting which hamper the
recognition of patterns and trends in the data. In this paper, we propose a
confluent drawing approach of parallel coordinates to support the web-based
interactive visual analytics of large multi-dimensional data. The proposed
method maps multi-dimensional data to node-link diagrams through the data
binning-based clustering for each dimension. It uses density-based confluent
drawing to visualize clusters and edges to reduce visual clutter and
overplotting. Its rendering time is independent of the number of data items. It
supports interactive visualization of large data sets without hardware
acceleration in a normal web browser. Moreover, we design interactions to
control the data binning process with this approach to support interactive
visual analytics of large multi-dimensional data sets. Based on the proposed
approach, we implement a web-based visual analytics application. The efficiency
of the proposed method is examined through experiments on several data sets.
The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through a user study, in
which two typical tasks of parallel coordinates plot are performed by
participants to compare the proposed method with another parallel coordinates
bundling technique. Results show that the proposed method significantly
enhances the web-based interactive visual analytics of large multi-dimensional

often hampered by the fact that investors' decisions are made under limited
information (no historical return data) and during an extremely limited
timeframe. Nevertheless, in some cases, rational investors with a certain level
of experience are able to ordinally rank investment alternatives through
relative assessments of the probabilities that investments will be successful.
However, to apply traditional portfolio optimization models, analysts must use
historical (or simulated/expected) return data as the basis for their
calculations. This paper develops an alternative portfolio optimization
framework that is able to handle this kind of information (given by an ordinal
ranking of investment alternatives) and to calculate an optimal capital
allocation based on a Cobb-Douglas function, which we call the Sorted Weighted
Portfolio (SWP). Considering risk-neutral investors, we show that the results
of this portfolio optimization model usually outperform the output generated by
the (intuitive) Equally Weighted Portfolio (EWP) of different investment

incorporate additional data (the ordinal ranking of the alternatives). To
further extend this work, we show that our model can also address risk-averse
