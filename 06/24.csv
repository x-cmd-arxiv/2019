time-consuming when the output sentence becomes longer, and (2) it lacks the
guidance of future context which is crucial to avoid under translation. To
alleviate these issues, we propose a synchronous bidirectional sequence
generation (SBSG) model which predicts its outputs from both sides to the
middle simultaneously. In the SBSG model, we enable the left-to-right (L2R) and
right-to-left (R2L) generation to help and interact with each other by
leveraging interactive bidirectional attention network. Experiments on neural
machine translation (En-De, Ch-En, and En-Ro) and text summarization tasks show

  Multi-granularity Image-text Alignments",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Description-based person re-identification (Re-id) is an important task in
video surveillance that requires discriminative cross-modal representations to
distinguish different people. It is difficult to directly measure the
similarity between images and descriptions due to the modality heterogeneity
(the cross-modal problem). And all samples belonging to a single category (the
fine-grained problem) makes this task even harder than the conventional
image-description matching task. In this paper, we propose a Multi-granularity
Image-text Alignments (MIA) model to alleviate the cross-modal fine-grained
problem for better similarity evaluation in description-based person Re-id.
Specifically, three different granularities, i.e., global-global, global-local
and local-local alignments are carried out hierarchically. Firstly, the
global-global alignment in the Global Contrast (GC) module is for matching the
global contexts of images and descriptions. Secondly, the global-local
alignment employs the potential relations between local components and global
contexts to highlight the distinguishable components while eliminating the
uninvolved ones adaptively in the Relation-guided Global-local Alignment (RGA)
module. Thirdly, as for the local-local alignment, we match visual human parts
with noun phrases in the Bi-directional Fine-grained Matching (BFM) module. The
whole network combining multiple granularities can be end-to-end trained
without complex pre-processing. To address the difficulties in training the
combination of multiple granularities, an effective step training strategy is
proposed to train these granularities step-by-step. Extensive experiments and
analysis have shown that our method obtains the state-of-the-art performance on
the CUHK-PEDES dataset and outperforms the previous methods by a significant
margin.

resolve a few open questions and show applicability to fair machine learning,
hypothesis testing, and to optimizing non-standard measures of classification
loss. Furthermore, our sample complexity bounds are tight amongst all
strategies that jointly minimize a composition of functions.
  The reductions approach to fair optimization can be abstracted as the
constrained group-objective optimization problem where we aim to optimize an
objective that is a function of losses of individual groups, subject to some
constraints. We give the first polynomial-time algorithms to solve the problem
with $(\epsilon, 0)$ or $(\epsilon, \delta)$ differential privacy guarantees
when defined on a convex decision set (for example, the $\ell_P$ unit ball)
with convex constraints and losses. Accompanying information-theoretic lower
bounds for the problem are presented. In addition, compared to a previous
method for ensuring differential privacy subject to a relaxed form of the
equalized odds fairness constraint, the $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially
private algorithm we present provides asymptotically better sample complexity
guarantees, resulting in an exponential improvement in certain parameter
regimes. We introduce a class of bounded divergence linear optimizers, which

  Reward Inference","Published at ICML 2019",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Our goal is for agents to optimize the right reward function, despite how
difficult it is for us to specify what that is. Inverse Reinforcement Learning
(IRL) enables us to infer reward functions from demonstrations, but it usually
assumes that the expert is noisily optimal. Real people, on the other hand,
often have systematic biases: risk-aversion, myopia, etc. One option is to try
to characterize these biases and account for them explicitly during learning.
But in the era of deep learning, a natural suggestion researchers make is to
avoid mathematical models of human behavior that are fraught with specific
assumptions, and instead use a purely data-driven approach. We decided to put
this to the test -- rather than relying on assumptions about which specific
bias the demonstrator has when planning, we instead learn the demonstrator's
planning algorithm that they use to generate demonstrations, as a
differentiable planner. Our exploration yielded mixed findings: on the one
hand, learning the planner can lead to better reward inference than relying on
the wrong assumption; on the other hand, this benefit is dwarfed by the loss we
incur by going from an exact to a differentiable planner. This suggest that at
least for the foreseeable future, agents need a middle ground between the
flexibility of data-driven methods and the useful bias of known human biases.

intelligence across a wide range of tasks. In the GGP competition, an agent is
given the rules of a game (described as a logic program) that it has never seen
before. The task is for the agent to play the game, thus generating game
traces. The winner of the GGP competition is the agent that gets the best total
score over all the games. In this paper, we invert this task: a learner is
given game traces and the task is to learn the rules that could produce the
traces. This problem is central to inductive general game playing (IGGP). We
introduce a technique that automatically generates IGGP tasks from GGP games.
We introduce an IGGP dataset which contains traces from 50 diverse games, such
as Sudoku, Sokoban, and Checkers. We claim that IGGP is difficult for existing
inductive logic programming (ILP) approaches. To support this claim, we
evaluate existing ILP systems on our dataset. Our empirical results show that
most of the games cannot be correctly learned by existing systems. The best
performing system solves only 40% of the tasks perfectly. Our results suggest
that IGGP poses many challenges to existing approaches. Furthermore, because we
can automatically generate IGGP tasks from GGP games, our dataset will continue
to grow with the GGP competition, as new games are added every year. We
therefore think that the IGGP problem and dataset will be valuable for
motivating and evaluating future research.

how they make choices by using a recommender app: the app presents each
investor with a pair of crypto assets with certain security-stability
characteristics to be compared. Each investor submits its preference for
adopting one of the two assets to the app. The app, in turn, provides a
recommendation on whether the proposed adoption is sensible given the assets'
essential features, information about the adoption choices of all other
investors, and expected future economic benefits of adoption. Investors
continue making their adoption choices over all pairs of crypto assets until
their expected future economic benefits can no longer be improved upon. This
constitutes an optimal selection decision. We simulate optimal selection
decisions considering the behaviour of different types of investors, driven by
their attitudes towards assets' features. We find a variety of possible
emergent outcomes for the investments in the crypto-ecosystem and the future
adoption of the crypto assets.

of error for conventional measurements based on laser scattering. Although
direct imaging of droplets can potentially overcome these limitations, imaging
suffers from a shallow depth of field as well as occlusions, which prevents the
complete spray from being analyzed. In comparison, digital inline holography
(DIH), a low-cost coherent imaging technique, can enable high-resolution
imaging of the sample over an extended depth of field, typically several orders
of magnitude larger than traditional imaging. In this study, we showcase an
automated DIH imaging system for characterizing monodisperse and polydisperse
aerosol droplet size and shape distributions in the 20 um-3 mm diameter range,
over a large sample volume. The high accuracy of the technique is demonstrated
by measurements of monodisperse droplets generated by a vibrating orifice
droplet generator, achieving a resolution of ~14.2. Measurements of a
polydisperse spray from a flat fan nozzle serve to establish the versatility of
DIH in extracting a two-dimensional size-eccentricity distribution function,
which indicates a strong semilogarithmic scaling between the two parameters
that decays as the droplet migrates away from the nozzle. Due to its low cost
and compact setup as well as the high density of data obtained, DIH can serve
as a promising approach for future aerosol characterization.

interactions between the inclusions modify their morphology and align them

factors contributing to the elastic interaction energy between precipitating

structures during phase separation in elastically coherent alloy systems. We
employ a phase-field model incorporating elastic interaction energy between the
misfitting phases to study microstructural evolution in ternary three-phase
alloy systems when the elastic moduli are anisotropic. The spatiotemporal
evolution of the composition field variables is governed by solving a set of
coupled Cahn-Hilliard equations numerically using a semi-implicit Fourier
spectral technique. We methodically vary the misfit strains, alloy chemistry
and elastic anisotropy to investigate their influence on domain morphology
during phase separation. The coherency strains between the phases and alloy
composition alter the coherent phase equilibria and decomposition pathways. The
degree of anisotropy in elastic moduli modifies the elastic interaction energy
between the precipitates depending on the sign and magnitude of relative
misfits, and thus determines the shape and alignment of the inclusions in the

subscheme $Z$ in a projective space as well as an infinite sequence of cones
over $Z$ in progressively higher dimension projective spaces. Recent work of
Aluffi introduces the Segre zeta function, a rational power series with integer
coefficients which captures the relationship between the Segre class of $Z$ and
those of its cones. The goal of this note is to define a relative version of
this construction for closed subschemes of projective bundles over a smooth
variety. If $Z$ is a closed subscheme of such a projective bundle $P(E)$, this
relative Segre zeta function will be a rational power series which describes
the Segre class of the cone over $Z$ in every projective bundle ""dominating""
$P(E)$. When the base variety is a point we recover the absolute Segre zeta
function for projective spaces. Part of our construction requires $Z$ to be the
zero scheme of a section of a bundle on $P(E)$ of rank smaller than that of $E$
that is able to extend to larger projective bundles. The question of what
bundles may extend in this sense seems independently interesting and we discuss
some related results, showing that at a minimum one can always count on direct
sums of line bundles to extend. Furthermore, the relative Segre zeta function
depends only on the Segre class of $Z$ and the total Chern class of the bundle
defining $Z$, and the basic forms of the numerator and denominator can be
described. As an application of our work we derive a Segre zeta function for
products of projective spaces and prove its key properties.

mid-infrared (MIR) spectral energy distributions and higher 22 $\mu$m
luminosities than expected from a proxy of the SFR (H$\alpha$ luminosity),
consistent with hosting AGNs with 2-10 keV luminosities of $\sim10^{44}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. We thus obtain and analyze the first hard ($>$ 10 keV) X-ray data
observed with NuSTAR and archival XMM-Newton data below 10 keV. From the NuSTAR
$\approx$20 ksec data, however, we find no significant hard X-ray emission. By
contrast, soft X-ray emission with 0.5--8 keV luminosities of $\approx10^{42}$
erg s$^{-1}$ is significantly detected in both targets, which can be explained
only by star formation (SF). A possible reason for the lack of clear evidence
is that a putative AGN torus absorbs most of the X-ray emission. Applying a
smooth-density AGN torus model, we determine minimum hydrogen column densities
along the equatorial plane ($N_{\rm H}^{\rm eq}$) consistent with the
non-detection. The results indicate $N_{\rm H}^{\rm eq} \gtrsim 2\times10^{24}$
cm$^{-2}$ for SDSS J0749+3337 and $N_{\rm H}^{\rm eq} \gtrsim 5\times10^{24}$
cm$^{-2}$ for SDSS J0822+2241. Therefore, the GPs may host such heavily
obscured AGNs. Otherwise, no AGN exists and the MIR emission is ascribed to SF.
Active SF in low-mass galaxies is indeed suggested to reproduce red MIR colors.
This would imply that diagnostics based on MIR photometry data alone may
misidentify such galaxies as AGNs.

non-negligible dust attenuation of the \Nplusa line emission. Assuming a
uniform dust screen approximation results a mean molecular gas column density
$> 10^{24}$\, cm$^{-2}$, with a molecular gas-to-dust mass ratio of 100. It is
clear that dust attenuation corrections should be accounted for when studying
FIR fine-structure lines in such systems. The attenuation corrected ratio of

probability distribution for the initial fluctuation is found quantum
mechanically, while the subsequent nonlinear evolution is determined by
classical dynamics. We find in a variety of cases that the rate of such flyover
transitions has the same parametric form as that of tunneling transitions
calculated using the instanton method, differing only by a numerical factor
O(1) in the exponent. An important exception is an ""upward"" transition from a
de Sitter vacuum to a higher-energy de Sitter vacuum state. The rate of flyover
transitions in this case is parametrically different and can be many orders of
magnitude higher than tunneling. This result is in conflict with the
conventional picture of quantum de Sitter space as a thermal state. Our
numerical simulations indicate that the dynamics of bubble nucleation in
flyover transitions is rather different from the standard picture. The
difference is especially strong for thin-wall bubbles in flat space, where the
transition region oscillates between true and false vacuum until a true vacuum
shell is formed which expands both inwards and outwards, and for upward de
Sitter transitions, where the inflating new vacuum region is contained inside

formations for the parabolic Ericksen-Leslie system. The finite time
singularity formation for the physical model might raise some concerns for
purposes of applications. This is, however, resolved satisfactorily; more
precisely, we are able to establish the global existence of weak solutions that

distribution to a well-defined value for all strain orientations, thus
essentially erasing the memory of the initial structure. It follows that in a
well-relaxed sample, plastic events cause the abrupt (nucleation-like)
emergence of a local softness contrast and thus precipitate the formation of a
band, which, in its early stages, is measurably softer than the steady-state
flow. Moreover, this postevent yield stress ensemble presents a mean value
comparable to that of the inherent states of a supercooled liquid around the
mode-coupling temperature $T_{\rm MCT}$. This, we argue, explains that the
transition between brittle and ductile yielding in amorphous materials occurs
around a comparable parent temperature. Our data also permit to capture
quantitatively the contributions of pressure and density changes and
demonstrate unambiguously that they are negligible compared with the changes of

photon state is known to be a single-photon state. We explore the influence of
brightness and linear loss on the heralded state of the signal mode. In
particular, we analyze the influence of the initial brightness and the loss on
the state nonclassicality by computing several measures of nonclassicality,
such as the negative volume of the Wigner function, the sum of quantum Fisher
information for two quadratures, and the ordering sensitivity, introduced
recently by us [Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 080402 (2019)]. We argue finally that the
TDS provide new benchmark states for the analysis of a variety of properties of
single-mode bosonic states.

functions indexed by time, space, or other high-dimensional index set. The GP
is a flexible model yet its limitation is given by its very nature: it can only
model Gaussian marginal distributions. To model non-Gaussian data, a GP can be
warped by a nonlinear transformation (or warping) as performed by warped GPs
(WGPs) and more computationally-demanding alternatives such as Bayesian WGPs
and deep GPs. However, the WGP requires a numerical approximation of the
inverse warping for prediction, which increases the computational complexity in
practice. To sidestep this issue, we construct a novel class of warpings
consisting of compositions of multiple elementary functions, for which the
inverse is known explicitly. We then propose the compositionally-warped GP
(CWGP), a non-Gaussian generative model whose expressiveness follows from its
deep compositional architecture, and its computational efficiency is guaranteed
by the analytical inverse warping. Experimental validation using synthetic and
real-world datasets confirms that the proposed CWGP is robust to the choice of
warpings and provides more accurate point predictions, better trained models
and shorter computation times than WGP.

global demand for food. To identify crop varieties with high yield potential,
plant scientists and breeders evaluate the performance of hundreds of lines in
multiple locations over several years. To facilitate the process of selecting
advanced varieties, an automated framework was developed in this study. A
hyperspectral camera was mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle to collect
aerial imagery with high spatial and spectral resolution. Aerial images were
captured in two consecutive growing seasons from three experimental yield
fields composed of hundreds experimental plots (1x2.4 meter), each contained a
single wheat line. The grain of more than thousand wheat plots was harvested by
a combine, weighed, and recorded as the ground truth data. To leverage the high
spatial resolution and investigate the yield variation within the plots, images
of plots were divided into sub-plots by integrating image processing techniques
and spectral mixture analysis with the expert domain knowledge. Afterwards, the
sub-plot dataset was divided into train, validation, and test sets using
stratified sampling. Subsequent to extracting features from each sub-plot, deep
neural networks were trained for yield estimation. The coefficient of
determination for predicting the yield of the test dataset at sub-plot scale
was 0.79 with root mean square error of 5.90 grams. In addition to providing
insights into yield variation at sub-plot scale, the proposed framework can
facilitate the process of high-throughput yield phenotyping as a valuable
decision support tool. It offers the possibility of (i) remote visual
inspection of the plots, (ii) studying the effect of crop density on yield, and
(iii) optimizing plot size to investigate more lines in a dedicated field each

which is performed without any traffic-level protection, thus enabling
manipulation, redirection, surveillance, and censorship. To address these
issues, large organizations such as Google and Cloudflare are deploying
recently standardized protocols that encrypt DNS traffic between end users and
recursive resolvers such as DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH). In
this paper, we examine whether encrypting DNS traffic can protect users from
traffic analysis-based monitoring and censoring. We propose a novel feature set
to perform the attacks, as those used to attack HTTPS or Tor traffic are not
suitable for DNS' characteristics. We show that traffic analysis enables the
identification of domains with high accuracy in closed and open world settings,
using 124 times less data than attacks on HTTPS flows. We find that factors
such as location, resolver, platform, or client do mitigate the attacks
performance but they are far from completely stopping them. Our results
indicate that DNS-based censorship is still possible on encrypted DNS traffic.
In fact, we demonstrate that the standardized padding schemes are not

a significant impact on data transmission and storage. Recent advances have
shown a great potential of learning image and video compression. Inspired from
related works, in this paper, we present an image compression architecture
using a convolutional autoencoder, and then generalize image compression to
video compression, by adding an interpolation loop into both encoder and
decoder sides. Our basic idea is to realize spatial-temporal energy compaction
in learning image and video compression. Thereby, we propose to add a spatial
energy compaction-based penalty into loss function, to achieve higher image
compression performance. Furthermore, based on temporal energy distribution, we
propose to select the number of frames in one interpolation loop, adapting to
the motion characteristics of video contents. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed image compression outperforms the latest image compression
standard with MS-SSIM quality metric, and provides higher performance compared
with state-of-the-art learning compression methods at high bit rates, which
benefits from our spatial energy compaction approach. Meanwhile, our proposed
video compression approach with temporal energy compaction can significantly
outperform MPEG-4 and is competitive with commonly used H.264. Both our image
and video compression can produce more visually pleasant results than
traditional standards.

topics in medical image segmentation in recent years. In this paper, we
construct an efficient two-stage PWML semantic segmentation network based on
the characteristics of the lesion, called refined segmentation R-CNN (RS RCNN).
We propose a heuristic RPN (H-RPN) which can utilize surrounding information
around the PWMLs for heuristic segmentation. Also, we design a lightweight
segmentation network to segment the lesion in a fast way. Densely connected
conditional random field (DCRF) is used to optimize the segmentation results.
We only use T1w MRIs to segment PWMLs. The result shows that our model can well
segment the lesion of ordinary size or even pixel size. The Dice similarity
coefficient reaches 0.6616, the sensitivity is 0.7069, the specificity is
0.9997, and the Hausdorff distance is 52.9130. The proposed method outperforms

make fair predictions? Previously, researchers developed ways to debias a model
for a single problem domain. However, this is often not how models are trained
and used in practice. For example, labels and demographics (sensitive
attributes) are often hard to observe, resulting in auxiliary or synthetic data
to be used for training, and proxies of the sensitive attribute to be used for
evaluation of fairness. A model trained for one setting may be picked up and
used in many others, particularly as is common with pre-training and cloud
APIs. Despite the pervasiveness of these complexities, remarkably little work
in the fairness literature has theoretically examined these issues. We frame
all of these settings as domain adaptation problems: how can we use what we
have learned in a source domain to debias in a new target domain, without
directly debiasing on the target domain as if it is a completely new problem?
We offer new theoretical guarantees of improving fairness across domains, and
offer a modeling approach to transfer to data-sparse target domains. We give
empirical results validating the theory and showing that these modeling
approaches can improve fairness metrics with less data.

degradation caused by domain shift, e.g., when training and test data come from
different domains. Most existing deep adaptation methods focus on reducing
domain shift by matching marginal feature distributions through deep
transformations on the input features, due to the unavailability of target
domain labels. We show that domain shift may still exist via label distribution
shift at the classifier, thus deteriorating model performances. To alleviate
this issue, we propose an approximate joint distribution matching scheme by
exploiting prediction uncertainty. Specifically, we use a Bayesian neural
network to quantify prediction uncertainty of a classifier. By imposing
distribution matching on both features and labels (via uncertainty), label
distribution mismatching in source and target data is effectively alleviated,
encouraging the classifier to produce consistent predictions across domains. We
also propose a few techniques to improve our method by adaptively reweighting
domain adaptation loss to achieve nontrivial distribution matching and stable
training. Comparisons with state of the art unsupervised domain adaptation
methods on three popular benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our
approach, especially on the effectiveness of alleviating negative transfer.

allows for a faithful and disembodied transmission of unknown quantum states

experiments on teleportation of quantum states of single photons, atoms,
trapped ions, defects in solid states, and superconducting circuits. However,
all demonstrations to date were limited to a two-dimensional
subspace$-$so-called qubit$-$of the quantized multiple levels of the quantum
systems. In general, a quantum particle can naturally possess not only multiple
degrees of freedom, but also, many degrees of freedom can have high quantum
number beyond the simplified two-level subspace. Here, making use of multiport
beam-splitters and ancillary single photons, we propose a resource-efficient
and extendable scheme for teleportation of arbitrarily high-dimensional
photonic quantum states. We report the first experimental teleportation of a
qutrit, which is equivalent to a spin-1 system. Measurements over a complete
set of 12 states in mutually unbiased bases yield a teleportation fidelity of
0.75(1), well above the optimal single-copy qutrit-state-estimation limit of
1/2. The fidelity also exceeds the limit of 2/3, the maximum possible for
explanation through qubits only. Thus, we strictly prove a genuine
three-dimensional, universal, and highly non-classical quantum teleportation.
Combining previous methods of teleportation of two-particle composite states
and multiple degrees of freedom, our work provides a complete toolbox for
teleporting a quantum particle intact. We expect that our results will pave the
way for quantum technology applications in high dimensions, since teleportation
plays a central role in quantum repeaters and quantum networks.

  Procedure Calls in C++",,,,,"cs.DC cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present HAM (Heterogeneous Active Messages), a C++-only active messaging
solution for heterogeneous distributed systems.Combined with a communication
protocol, HAM can be used as a generic Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanism.
It has been used in HAM-Offload to implement a low-overhead offloading
framework for inter- and intra-node offloading between different architectures
including accelerators like the Intel Xeon Phi x100 series and the NEC
SX-Aurora TSUBASA Vector Engine. HAM uses template meta-programming to
implicitly generate active message types and their corresponding handler
functions. Heterogeneity is enabled by providing an efficient address
translation mechanism between the individual handler code addresses of
processes running different binaries on different architectures, as well a
hooks to inject serialisation and deserialisation code on a per-type basis.
Implementing such a solution in modern C++ sheds some light on the shortcomings
and grey areas of the C++ standard when it comes to distributed and
heterogeneous environments.

the triple-top production to pb level. We illustrate how certain signal regions
of four-top search can be utilized to constrain triple-top production, but urge
a dedicated search. As an aside, we note that the CMS study at 13 TeV of scalar

The GFPP is a
renewal process generalizing Laskin's fractional Poisson counting process and
was first introduced by Cahoy and Polito. The GFPP contains two index
parameters with admissible ranges $0<\beta\leq 1$, $\alpha >0$ and a parameter
characterizing the time scale. The GFPP involves Prabhakar generalized
Mittag-Leffler functions and contains for special choices of the parameters the
Laskin fractional Poisson process, the Erlang process and the standard Poisson

Montroll-Weiss continuous-time random walk (CTRW) for the GFPP on undirected
networks which has Prabhakar distributed waiting times between the jumps of the
walker. For this walk, we derive a generalized fractional Kolmogorov-Feller
equation which involves Prabhakar generalized fractional operators governing
the stochastic motions on the network. We analyze in $d$ dimensions the
'well-scaled' diffusion limit and obtain a fractional diffusion equation which
is of the same type as for a walk with Mittag-Leffler distributed waiting

information of the message. Since the work by Guruswami and Wang, there have
been some further investigations on the list decoding of insertion codes,
deletion codes and insdel codes. However, unlike classical Hamming metric or
even rank-metric, there are still many unsolved problems on list decoding of
insdel codes.
  The contributions of this paper mainly consist of two parts. Firstly, we
analyze the list decodability of random insdel codes. We show that list
decoding of random insdel codes surpasses the Singleton bound when there are
more insertion errors than deletion errors and the alphabet size is
sufficiently large. Furthermore, our results reveal the existence of an insdel
code that can be list decoded against insdel errors beyond its minimum insdel
distance while still having polynomial list size. This provides a more complete
picture on the list decodability of insdel codes when both insertion and
deletion errors happen. Secondly, we construct a family of explicit insdel
codes with efficient list decoding algorithm. As a result, we derive a
Zyablov-type bound for insdel errors. Recently, after our results appeared,
Guruswami et al. provided a complete solution for another open problem on list
decoding of insdel codes. In contrast to the problems we considered, they
provided a region containing all possible insertion and deletion errors that
are still list decodable by some q-ary insdel codes of non-zero rate. More
specifically, for a fixed number of insertion and deletion errors, while our
paper focuses on maximizing the rate of a code that is list decodable against
that amount of insertion and deletion errors, Guruswami et al. focuses on
finding out the existence of a code with asymptotically non-zero rate which is
list decodable against this amount of insertion and deletion errors.

years. Due to the large scale variation, it remains to be a challenging task.
Previous methods adopt either multi-column CNN or single-column CNN with
multiple branches to deal with this problem. However, restricted by the number
of columns or branches, these methods can only capture a few different scales
and have limited capability. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective
network called DSNet for crowd counting, which can be easily trained in an
end-to-end fashion. The key component of our network is the dense dilated
convolution block, in which each dilation layer is densely connected with the
others to preserve information from continuously varied scales. The dilation
rates in dilation layers are carefully selected to prevent the block from
gridding artifacts. To further enlarge the range of scales covered by the
network, we cascade three blocks and link them with dense residual connections.
We also introduce a novel multi-scale density level consistency loss for
performance improvement. To evaluate our method, we compare it with
state-of-the-art algorithms on four crowd counting datasets (ShanghaiTech,
UCF-QNRF, UCF_CC_50 and UCSD). Experimental results demonstrate that DSNet can
achieve the best performance and make significant improvements on all the four
datasets (30% on the UCF-QNRF and UCF_CC_50, and 20% on the others).

models for compiler verification. Laurent develops a sequent-style subtyping
system, without transitivity, and proves transitivity via a sequence of six
lemmas that culminate in cut-elimination (2018). This article develops a
subtyping system in regular style that omits transitivity and provides a direct
proof of transitivity, significantly reducing the length of the proof,
exchanging the six lemmas for just one. Inspired by Laurent's system, the rule
for function types is essentially the $\beta$-soundness property. The new
system satisfies the ""subformula conjunction property"": every type occurring in
the derivation of $A <: B$ is a subformula of $A$ or $B$, or an intersection of
such subformulas. The article proves that the new subtyping system is
equivalent to that of Barendregt, Coppo, and Dezani-Ciancaglini.

The network is said to be uniquely registrable if the global coordinates can be

rigidity of the body graph of the network. A particularly simple
characterization of unique registrability is obtained for planar networks.
Further, we show that $k$-vertex-connectivity of the body graph is equivalent

in maximizing the probability of correct detection for the positive class
(i.e., true positive probability) subject to a lower-bound on the probability
of correct detection for the negative class (i.e., true negative probability).
For conditionally Gaussian data points (conditioned on the class) and linear
support vector machine classifiers, we rewrite the optimization problems of the
adversary and the classifier as convex optimization problems and use best
response dynamics to learn an equilibrium of the game. This results in
computing a linear support vector machine classifier that is robust against
adversarial input manipulations. We illustrate the framework on a synthetic
dataset and a public Cardiovascular Disease dataset.

are weaker than the red-shifted ones. Although this may be attributed to the

atomic vibrations, whose microscopic dynamics is well described by the
linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation. Recently, it was shown that
thermal conductivity can be resolved exactly and in a closed form as a sum over
relaxons, $\mathit{i.e.}$ collective phonon excitations that are the
eigenvectors of Boltzmann equation's scattering matrix [Cepellotti and Marzari,
PRX $\mathbf{6}$ (2016)]. Relaxons have a well-defined parity, and only odd
relaxons contribute to the thermal conductivity. Here, we show that the
complementary set of even relaxons determines another quantity --- the thermal
viscosity --- that enters into the description of heat transport, and is
especially relevant in the hydrodynamic regime, where dissipation of crystal
momentum by Umklapp scattering phases out. We also show how the thermal
conductivity and viscosity parametrize two novel viscous heat equations --- two
coupled equations for the temperature and drift-velocity fields --- which
represent the thermal counterpart of the Navier-Stokes equations of
hydrodynamics in the linear, laminar regime. These viscous heat equations are
derived from a coarse-graining of the linearized Boltzmann transport equation
for phonons, and encompass both limits of Fourier's law and of second sound,
taking place, respectively, in the regimes of strong or weak momentum
dissipation. Last, we introduce the Fourier deviation number as a descriptor
that captures the deviations from Fourier's law due to hydrodynamic effects. We
showcase these findings in a test case of a complex-shaped device made of
graphite, obtaining a remarkable agreement with the very recent experimental
demonstration of hydrodynamic transport in this material. The present findings
also suggest that hydrodynamic behavior can appear at room temperature in

  Embedding with Isolation Kernel",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a new insight into improving the performance of
Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) by using Isolation kernel instead of
Gaussian kernel. Isolation kernel outperforms Gaussian kernel in two aspects.
First, the use of Isolation kernel in t-SNE overcomes the drawback of
misrepresenting some structures in the data, which often occurs when Gaussian
kernel is applied in t-SNE. This is because Gaussian kernel determines each
local bandwidth based on one local point only, while Isolation kernel is
derived directly from the data based on space partitioning. Second, the use of
Isolation kernel yields a more efficient similarity computation because
data-dependent Isolation kernel has only one parameter that needs to be tuned.
In contrast, the use of data-independent Gaussian kernel increases the
computational cost by determining n bandwidths for a dataset of n points. As
the root cause of these deficiencies in t-SNE is Gaussian kernel, we show that
simply replacing Gaussian kernel with Isolation kernel in t-SNE significantly

characterizing tissue and locating lesions of patients as in standard
diagnosis. However, abdominal MRI often suffers from respiratory motion
artifacts, which leads to blurring and ghosting that significantly deteriorate
the imaging quality. Conventional methods to reduce or eliminate these motion
artifacts include breath holding, patient sedation, respiratory gating, and
image post-processing, but these strategies inevitably involve extra scanning
time and patient discomfort. In this paper, we propose a novel
deep-learning-based model to recover MR images from respiratory motion
artifacts. The proposed model comprises a densely connected U-net with
generative adversarial network (GAN)-guided training and a perceptual loss
function. We validate the model using a diverse collection of MRI data that are
adversely affected by both synthetic and authentic respiration artifacts.
Effective outcomes of motion removal are demonstrated. Our experimental results
show the great potential of utilizing deep-learning-based methods in
respiratory motion correction for abdominal MRI.

  Quality Object Detection""",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In object detection, the intersection over union (IoU) threshold is
frequently used to define positives/negatives. The threshold used to train a
detector defines its \textit{quality}. While the commonly used threshold of 0.5
leads to noisy (low-quality) detections, detection performance frequently
degrades for larger thresholds. This paradox of high-quality detection has two
causes: 1) overfitting, due to vanishing positive samples for large thresholds,
and 2) inference-time quality mismatch between detector and test hypotheses. A
multi-stage object detection architecture, the Cascade R-CNN, composed of a
sequence of detectors trained with increasing IoU thresholds, is proposed to
address these problems. The detectors are trained sequentially, using the
output of a detector as training set for the next. This resampling
progressively improves hypotheses quality, guaranteeing a positive training set
of equivalent size for all detectors and minimizing overfitting. The same
cascade is applied at inference, to eliminate quality mismatches between
hypotheses and detectors. An implementation of the Cascade R-CNN without bells
or whistles achieves state-of-the-art performance on the COCO dataset, and
significantly improves high-quality detection on generic and specific object
detection datasets, including VOC, KITTI, CityPerson, and WiderFace. Finally,
the Cascade R-CNN is generalized to instance segmentation, with nontrivial
improvements over the Mask R-CNN. To facilitate future research, two
implementations are made available at

Materials and methods: We assessed the potential added value of PVE integration
as a part of the automatic coronary lumen segmentation algorithm by means of
segmentation accuracy using the MICCAI 2012 challenge framework and by means of
flow simulation overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, negative and
positive predictive values and the receiver operated characteristic (ROC) area
under the curve. We also evaluated the potential benefit of accounting for PVE
in automatic segmentation for flow-simulation for lesions that were diagnosed
as obstructive based on CCTA, which could have indicated a need for an invasive
exam and revascularization. Results: Our segmentation algorithm improves the
maximal surface distance error by ~39% compared to previously published method
on the 18 datasets 50 from the MICCAI 2012 challenge with comparable Dice and
mean surface distance. Results with and without accounting for PVE were
comparable. In contrast, integrating PVE analysis into an automatic coronary
lumen segmentation algorithm improved the flow simulation specificity from 0.6
to 0.68 with the same sensitivity of 0.83. Also, accounting for PVE improved
the area under the ROC curve for detecting hemodynamically significant CAD from
0.76 to 0.8 compared to automatic segmentation without PVE analysis with
invasive FFR threshold of 0.8 as the reference standard. The improvement in the
AUC was statistically significant (N=76, Delong's test, p=0.012). Conclusion:
Accounting for the partial volume effects in automatic coronary lumen

variables, continuous variables need to be digitized using an appropriate code
such as the Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill (GKP) qubit. The scheme introduced in
[K. Fukui et. al., Phys. Rev. X 8, 021054 (2018)] has reduced the threshold of
a squeezing level required for continuous-variable FTQC to less than 10 dB,
assuming noise derived from the GKP qubit itself. In this work, we propose a
scheme to improve noise tolerance during the construction of large-scale
cluster state used for FTQC with the GKP qubits. In our scheme, a small-scale
cluster state is prepared by employing a maximum-likelihood method, the
entanglement generation via the Bell measurement, and a probabilistic reliable
measurement. Then, a large-scale cluster state is construct from the
small-scale cluster states via the encoded Bell measurement. In the numerical
calculations, we assume errors derived from the two-mode gate and loss in the
homodyne measurement in addition to noise from the GKP qubit itself. The
results show that the thresholds of a squeezing level are around 8.1, 9.6, and
12.4 dB for loss in the homodyne measurement 0, 5, and 10 %, respectively.
Hence, this work provides a way toward continuous-variable FTQC with a feasible
squeezing level.

rewards through iteratively using the Bellman equation as an update, in an

Conventionally, the loss function is defined as the temporal difference between
the action value and the expected (discounted) reward, however it focuses
solely on the future, leading to overestimation errors. We extend the
well-established Q-learning techniques by introducing the hindsight factor, an
additional loss term that takes into account how the model progresses, by
integrating the historic temporal difference as part of the reward. The effect
of this modification is examined in a deterministic continuous-state space
function estimation problem, where the overestimation phenomenon is
significantly reduced and results in improved stability. The underlying effect
of the hindsight factor is modeled as an adaptive learning rate, which unlike
existing adaptive optimizers, takes into account the previously estimated
action value.
  The proposed method outperforms variations of Q-learning, with an overall
higher average reward and lower action values, which supports the deterministic
evaluation, and proves that the hindsight factor contributes to lower
overestimation errors. The mean average score of 100 episodes obtained after
training for 10 million frames shows that the hindsight factor outperforms deep
Q-networks, double deep Q-networks and dueling networks for a variety of ATARI

  Formerly, it was proven that $K_r$ minor free graphs admit weak
decompositions with padding parameter $O(r)$, while for strong decompositions
only $O(r^2)$ padding parameter was known. Furthermore, for the case of a graph

  Quadrotors","IEEE Transactions on Robotics",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Trajectory replanning for quadrotors is essential to enable fully autonomous
flight in unknown environments. Hierarchical motion planning frameworks, which
combine path planning with path parameterization, are popular due to their time
efficiency. However, the path planning cannot properly deal with non-static
initial states of the quadrotor, which may result in non-smooth or even
dynamically infeasible trajectories. In this paper, we present an efficient
kinodynamic replanning framework by exploiting the advantageous properties of
the B-spline, which facilitates dealing with the non-static state and
guarantees safety and dynamical feasibility. Our framework starts with an
efficient B-spline-based kinodynamic (EBK) search algorithm which finds a
feasible trajectory with minimum control effort and time. To compensate for the
discretization induced by the EBK search, an elastic optimization (EO) approach
is proposed to refine the control point placement to the optimal location.
Systematic comparisons against the state-of-the-art are conducted to validate
the performance. Comprehensive onboard experiments using two different
vision-based quadrotors are carried out showing the general applicability of
the framework.

  Protocols and Modern IT Networks",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An attack graph is a method used to enumerate the possible paths that an
attacker can execute in the organization network. MulVAL is a known open-source
framework used to automatically generate attack graphs. MulVAL's default
modeling has two main shortcomings. First, it lacks the representation of
network protocol vulnerabilities, and thus it cannot be used to model common
network attacks such as ARP poisoning, DNS spoofing, and SYN flooding. Second,
it does not support advanced types of communication such as wireless and bus
communication, and thus it cannot be used to model cyber-attacks on networks
that include IoT devices or industrial components. In this paper, we present an
extended network security model for MulVAL that: (1) considers the physical
network topology, (2) supports short-range communication protocols (e.g.,
Bluetooth), (3) models vulnerabilities in the design of network protocols, and
(4) models specific industrial communication architectures. Using the proposed
extensions, we were able to model multiple attack techniques including:
spoofing, man-in-the-middle, and denial of service, as well as attacks on
advanced types of communication. We demonstrate the proposed model on a testbed

environments is challenging since there are numerous semantic elements (such as
dynamic agents, traffic lights and speed limits) to consider. These semantic
elements may have different mathematical descriptions such as obstacle,
constraint and cost. It is non-trivial to tune the effects from different
combinations of semantic elements for a stable and generalizable behavior. In
this paper, we propose a novel unified spatio-temporal semantic corridor (SSC)
structure, which provides a level of abstraction for different types of
semantic elements. The SSC consists of a series of mutually connected
collision-free cubes with dynamical constraints posed by the semantic elements
in the spatio-temporal domain. The trajectory generation problem then boils
down to a general quadratic programming (QP) formulation. Thanks to the unified
SSC representation, our framework can generalize to any combination of semantic
elements. Moreover, our formulation provides a theoretical guarantee that the
entire trajectory is safe and constraint-satisfied, by using the convex hull
and hodograph properties of piecewise Bezier curve parameterization. We also
release the code of our method to accommodate benchmarking.

uppermost valence band (UVB). Both bands are spin degenerate at the
Gamma-point. All other states are neglected. The resulting exciton states are
analyzed in the framework of an invariant expansion of a model Hamiltonian: The
spin-orbit coupling in the conduction- and valence band is simulated by
introducing a fictive magnetic field, giving rise to a splitting of the
electron- and hole states outside the $\Gamma$-point. Then the electron-hole
exchange-interaction is introduced into the exciton Hamiltonian. It is due to
the fact that electron and hole are indistinguishable particles in the exciton
problem. In D3h crystal symmetry this electron-hole exchange-interaction has
two different contributions: While a first term accounts for an energy
re-normalization of all exciton states, a second term does not influence the
optical active (spin-singlet) states but affects only the optical inactive
(spin-triplet) states, which become mixed in-between the different exciton

wishes to broadcast information to $n$ receivers in a way that enables the
$i$th receiver to retrieve the $i$th bit $x_i$. Every receiver has prior side
information comprising a subset of the bits of $x$, and the goal is to minimize
the length of the information sent via the broadcast channel. Porter and
Wootters have recently introduced the model of embedded index coding, where the
receivers also play the role of the sender and the goal is to minimize the
total length of their broadcast information. An embedded index code is said to
be task-based if every receiver retrieves its bit based only on the information
provided by one of the receivers.
  This paper studies the effect of the task-based restriction on linear
embedded index coding. It is shown that for certain side information maps there
exists a linear embedded index code of length quadratically smaller than that
of any task-based embedded index code. The result attains, up to a
multiplicative constant, the largest possible gap between the two quantities.
The proof is by an explicit construction and the analysis involves spectral
techniques.

from five minutes in the photosphere to three minutes in the chromosphere. In
this paper, we explore the two most popular models proposed to explain the
three-minute oscillations: the chromospheric acoustic resonator and the
propagation of waves with frequency above the cutoff value directly from lower
layers. We employ numerical simulations of wave propagation from the solar
interior to the corona. Waves are driven by a piston at the bottom boundary. We
have performed a parametric study of the measured chromospheric power spectra
in a large number of numerical simulations with differences in the driving
method, the height of the transition region (or absence of transition region),
the strength of the vertical magnetic field, and the value of the radiative
cooling time. We find that both mechanisms require the presence of waves with
period in the three-minute band at the photosphere. These waves propagate
upward and their amplitude increases due to the drop of the density. Their
amplification is stronger than that of evanescent low-frequency waves. This
effect is enough to explain the dominant period observed in chromospheric
spectral lines. However, waves are partially trapped between the photosphere
and the transition region, forming an acoustic resonator. This chromospheric
resonant cavity strongly enhances the power in the three-minute band. The
chromospheric acoustic resonator model and the propagation of waves in the
three-minute band directly from the photosphere can explain the observed
chromospheric three-minute oscillations. They are both important in different
scenarios. Resonances are produced by waves trapped between the temperature
minimum and the transition region. Strong magnetic fields and radiative losses
remove energy from the waves inside the cavity, resulting in weaker amplitude
resonances.

Newtonian dynamics. The normalization of $g2$-space significantly reduce the
effect of both random and systematic uncertainties as well as enable a
comparison of the geometries of different galaxies. Analyzing the gas-dominated
galaxies (as opposed to other galaxies) further suppress the impact of the mass
to light ratios.
  It is found that the overall geometry of the gas dominated galaxies in SPARC
is consistent with a rightward curving geometry in the normalized $g2$-space
(characterized by $r_{obs}>r_{bar}$, where $r_{bar}=\arg \max_r[g_{bar}(r)]$

geometry of all galaxies in SPARC which best approximates a geometry curing
nowhere in normalized $g2$-space (characterized by $r_{obs}=r_{bar}$) with a
slight inclination toward a rightward curving geometry. The geometry of the gas
dominated galaxies not only indicate the true (independent of mass to light
ratios to leading order) geometry of data in $g2$-space (which can be used to
infer properties on the solution to the missing mass problem) but also - when

complex environments due to the integration with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).
At the same time, Genetic Algorithms (GAs), often seen as a competing approach
to RL, had limited success in scaling up to the DNNs required to solve
challenging tasks. Contrary to this dichotomic view, in the physical world,
evolution and learning are complementary processes that continuously interact.
The recently proposed Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL) framework has
demonstrated mutual benefits to performance when combining the two methods.
However, ERL has not fully addressed the scalability problem of GAs. In this
paper, we show that this problem is rooted in an unfortunate combination of a
simple genetic encoding for DNNs and the use of traditional
biologically-inspired variation operators. When applied to these encodings, the
standard operators are destructive and cause catastrophic forgetting of the
traits the networks acquired. We propose a novel algorithm called Proximal
Distilled Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (PDERL) that is characterised by
a hierarchical integration between evolution and learning. The main innovation
of PDERL is the use of learning-based variation operators that compensate for
the simplicity of the genetic representation. Unlike traditional operators, our
proposals meet the functional requirements of variation operators when applied
on directly-encoded DNNs. We evaluate PDERL in five robot locomotion settings
from the OpenAI gym. Our method outperforms ERL, as well as two
state-of-the-art RL algorithms, PPO and TD3, in all tested environments.

that end we introduce the notion of Low Density Majority Codes (LDMCs). These
codes are non-linear sparse-graph codes, which output majority function
evaluated on randomly chosen small subsets of the data bits. This is similar to
  Low Density Generator Matrix codes (LDGMs), except that the XOR function is

performance of any linear systematic code. The effect of non-linearity
bootstraping the initial iterations of BP, suggests that LDMCs should improve

numerically the local plastic thresholds in the steady state flow of a

specifically, we compute the local residual strength, $\Delta\tau^{c}$, for
arbitrary loading orientations and find that plastic deformation generically
induces material polarization, i.e., a forward-backward asymmetry in the
$\Delta\tau^{c}$ distribution. In steady plastic flow, local packings are on
average closer to forward (rather than backward) instabilities, due to the
stress-induced bias of barriers. However, presumably due to mechanical noise, a
significant fraction of zones lie close to reverse (backward) yielding, as the
distribution of $\Delta\tau^{c}$ for reverse shearing extends quasilinearly
down to zero local residual strength. By constructing an elementary model of
the early plastic response, we then show that unloading causes reverse
plasticity of a growing amplitude, i.e., reverse softening, while it shifts
away forward-yielding barriers. This result in an inversion of polarization in
the low-$\Delta\tau^{c}$ region and, consequently, in the Bauschinger effect.
This scenario is quite generic, which explains the pervasiveness of the effect.

of about 0.1 mas/yr, significant at 2-sigma level. This supports a similar
conclusion based on a comparison with stellar positions in the Hipparcos frame.
The accuracy is currently limited by the small number of radio sources used, by
uncertainties in the Gaia DR2 proper motions, and by the astrophysical nature
of the radio stars. While the origin of the indicated rotation is understood
and can be avoided in future data releases, it remains important to validate
the bright reference frame of Gaia by independent observations. This can be
achieved using VLBI astrometry, which may require re-observing the old sample
of radio stars as well as measuring new objects. The unique historical value of
positional measurements is stressed and VLBI observers are urged to ensure that
relevant positional information is preserved for the future.

within the solar circle at a Galactocentric distance of about 7 kpc. Few open
clusters have been studied in detail in the inner disc region before the
Gaia-ESO Survey. New data from the Gaia-ESO Survey allowed us to conduct an
extended radial velocity membership study as well as spectroscopic metallicity
and detailed chemical abundance measurements for this cluster. Gaia-ESO Survey
data for 142 potential members, lying on the upper MS and on the red clump,
yielded radial velocity measurements, which, together with proper motion
measurements from the Gaia DR2, were used to determine the systemic velocity of
the cluster and membership of individual stars. Photometry from Gaia DR2 was
used to re-determine cluster parameters based on high confidence member stars
only. Cluster abundance measurements of six radial-velocity member stars with
UVES high-resolution spectroscopy are presented for 23 elements. According to
the new estimates, based on high confidence members, Pismis 18 has an age of
$700^{+40}_{-50}$ Myr, interstellar reddening of E(B-V) =
$0.562^{+0.012}_{-0.026}$ mag and a de-reddened distance modulus of $DM_0 =
11.96^{+0.10}_{-0.24}$ mag. The median metallicity of the cluster (using the
six UVES stars) is [Fe/H] = $+0.23 \pm 0.05$ dex, with [$\alpha$/Fe]= $0.07 \pm
0.13$ and a slight enhancement of s- and r- neutron-capture elements. With the
present work, we fully characterized the open cluster Pismis 18, confirming its
present location in the inner disc. We estimated a younger age than the
previous literature values and gave, for the first time, its metallicity and
its detailed abundances. Its [$\alpha$/Fe] and [s-process/Fe], both slightly
super-solar, are in agreement with other inner-disc open clusters observed by
the Gaia-ESO survey. [abridged]

re-identification attacks based on the concept of honeytokens, decoy or ""bait""
records with the goal to lure malicious users. While the concept of honeytokens
has been widely used in the security domain, this is the first approach to
apply the concept on the data privacy domain. Records with high
re-identification risk, called AnonTokens, are inserted into anonymized

feasible without significant impact on the released dataset.

solved through a power series expansion, which reduces in solving difference
equations. In this paper a probability problem is presented whose solution
follows a completely reversed but systematic approach. Hence, this work is
about illustrating how complex probability problems could be tackled with the
more powerful techniques of a better studied and well understood field, that of
differential equations. The problem is defined as follows: Inside a box
containing r red and w white balls random removals occur. The balls are removed
successively according to the three following rules. Rule I: If a white ball is
chosen it is immediately discarded. If a red ball is chosen, it is placed back
into the box and a new ball is randomly chosen. The second ball is then removed
irrespective of the color. Rule II: Once one ball is removed, the game
continues from Rule I. Rule III: The game ends once all the red balls are
removed. The question posed is the determination of the probability that k
white balls remain where k = 0, 1, 2, ..., w. Ending the game once all the
white balls are removed, a second question is the determination of the
probability that k red balls remain where k = 0, 1, 2, ..., r. While inductive
solutions are possible, the current approach demonstrates a different and
algorithmic route. In particular, the law of total probability yields a
recursion that is transformed into a linear inhomogeneous 2D PDE, with suitable
boundary conditions. The PDE solutions, which are found analytically, provide
the generating functionals of the required probabilities as a function of r, w
and k. Using the functionals, the probability formulas for any r, w and k are
finally obtained in a closed form. Reproducing existing results of the
literature this method is quite generic and adaptable to a large class of
problems.

result in claims of human parity that in fact simply correspond to Type II

Reinforcement learning (RL) is particularly promising method for neuromorphic

are considered under the assumption of perfect and imperfect channel state
information (CSI). Low-resolution ADCs are considered for both data detection
and channel estimation, and the resulting performance is analyzed. Asymptotic
approximations of the spectrum efficiency (SE) for large systems are derived
based on random matrix theory. With these results, we can provide insights into
the trade-offs between the SE and the ADC resolution and study the influence of
the Rician K-factors on the performance. It is shown that a large value of
K-factors may lead to better performance and alleviate the influence of
quantization noise on channel estimation. Moreover, we investigate the power
scaling laws for both receivers under imperfect CSI and it shows that when the
number of base station (BS) antennas is very large, without loss of SE
performance, the transmission power can be scaled by the number of BS antennas
for both receivers while the overall performance is limited by the resolution
of ADCs. The asymptotic analysis is validated by numerical results. Besides, it
is also shown that the SE gap between the two receivers is narrowed down when
the K-factor is increased. We also show that ADCs with moderate resolutions
lead to better energy efficiency (EE) than that with high-resolution or
extremely low-resolution ADCs and using ZF receivers achieve higher EE as
compared with the MRC receivers.

II: The Effect of Streaming Velocities","16 pages, 21 figures, resubmitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/staa2605",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Models of the decoupling of baryons and photons during the recombination
epoch predict the existence of a large-scale velocity offset between baryons
and dark matter at later times, the so-called streaming velocity. In this
paper, we use high resolution numerical simulations to investigate the impact
of this streaming velocity on the spin and shape distributions of high-redshift
minihalos, the formation sites of the earliest generation of stars. We find
that the presence of a streaming velocity has a negligible effect on the spin
and shape of the dark matter component of the minihalos. However, it strongly
affects the behaviour of the gas component. The most probable spin parameter
increases from $\sim$0.03 in the absence of streaming to $\sim$0.15 for a run
with a streaming velocity of three times $\sigma_{\rm rms}$, corresponding to
1.4 km\,s$^{-1}{}$ at redshift $z=15$. The gas within the minihalos becomes
increasingly less spherical and more oblate as the streaming velocity
increases, with dense clumps being found at larger distances from the halo
centre. The impact of the streaming velocity is also mass-dependent: less
massive objects are influenced more strongly, on account of their shallower
potential wells. The number of halos in which gas cooling and runaway
gravitational collapse occurs decreases substantially as the streaming velocity
increases. However, the spin and shape distributions of gas that does manage to
cool and collapse are insensitive to the value of the streaming velocity and we
therefore do not expect the properties of the stars that formed from this
collapsed gas to depend on the value of the streaming velocity. The spin and
shape of this central gas clump are uncorrelated with the same properties
measured on the scale of the halo as a whole.

instructed to step in time to the avatar's movements, as viewed through a

errors (asynchronies) between them. Participants completed either a visual-only

asynchronies exhibited slow drift in the Visual-Only condition, but became

Digital Sky Survey imaging and its bar pattern speed (Omega_bar=71+/-4
km/s/kpc) using the Tremaine-Weinberg method with stellar-absorption
integral-field spectroscopy performed with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic
Explorer at the Very Large Telescope. We derived the circular velocity
(V_circ=189+/-10 km/s) by correcting the stellar streaming velocity for
asymmetric drift and calculated the corotation radius (R_cor=2.8+/-0.2 kpc)
from the bar pattern speed. Finally, we estimated the bar rotation rate
(R_cor/a_bar=0.88+/-0.23). We find that NGC 4264 hosts a strong and large bar
extending out to the corotation radius. This means that the bar is rotating as
fast as it can like nearly all the other bars measured so far even when the
systematic error due to the uncertainty on the disc position angle is taken
into account. The accurate measurement of the bar rotation rate allows us to
infer that the formation of the bar of NGC 4264 was due to self-generated
internal processes and not triggered by the ongoing interaction.

of the target to even modest surges in the miRNA transcription rate. While
static, competition-mediated regulation can be achieved by the miRNA-decoy

games with unsplittable flows. The goal is to place tolls on edges, such that
there exists a pure Nash equilibrium in the tolled game that is a social
optimum in the untolled one. Additionally, we require the number of tolled
edges to be the minimum. This problem has been extensively studied in
non-atomic games, however, to the best of our knowledge, it as not been
considered for atomic games before. By a reduction from the weighted CNF SAT
problem, we show both the NP-hardness of the problem and the W[2]-hardness when
parameterizing the problem with the number of tolled edges. On the positive
side, we present a polynomial time algorithm for networks on series-parallel
graphs that turns any given state of the untolled game into a pure Nash
equilibrium of the tolled game with the minimum number of tolled edges.

interesting result is that TOI-150b shows an eccentric orbit
($e=0.262^{+0.045}_{-0.037}$), which is quite uncommon among hot Jupiters. We
estimate that this is consistent, however, with the circularization timescale
which is slightly larger than the age of the system. These two hot Jupiters are
both prime candidates for further characterization --- in particular, both are
excellent candidates for determining spin-orbit alignments via the
Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect and for characterizing atmospheric thermal

located closely to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Continuous Viewing

estimation scheme based on compressive sensing. By exploiting the sporadic
traffic of massive connected user equipments and the virtual angular domain
sparsity of massive MIMO channels, the proposed scheme can support massive
access with dramatically reduced access latency. Specifically, we design
non-orthogonal pseudo-random pilots for uplink broadband massive access, and
formulate the active user detection and channel estimation problems as a
generalized multiple measurement vector compressive sensing problem.
Furthermore, by leveraging the structured sparsity of the uplink channel
matrix, we propose an efficient generalized multiple measurement vector
approximate message passing (GMMV-AMP) algorithm to realize simultaneous active
user detection and channel estimation based on a spatial domain or an angular
domain channel model. To jointly exploit the channel sparsity presented in both
the spatial and the angular domains for enhanced performance, a Turbo-GMMV-AMP
algorithm is developed for detecting the active users and estimating their
channels in an alternating manner. Finally, an adaptive access scheme is
proposed, which adapts the access latency to guarantee reliable massive access
for practical systems with unknown channel sparsity level. Additionally, the
state evolution of the proposed GMMV-AMP algorithm is derived to predict its
performance. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
active user detection and channel estimation schemes compared to several
baseline schemes.

estimation of the pose, i.e., the relative position and attitude, of a known
non-cooperative spacecraft using monocular vision. In contrast to other
state-of-the-art pose estimation approaches for spaceborne applications, the
SPN method does not require the formulation of hand-engineered features and
only requires a single grayscale image to determine the pose of the spacecraft
relative to the camera. The SPN method uses a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) with three branches to solve for the pose. The first branch of the CNN
bootstraps a state-of-the-art object detector to detect a 2D bounding box
around the target spacecraft. The region inside the bounding box is then used
by the other two branches of the CNN to determine the attitude by initially
classifying the input region into discrete coarse attitude labels before
regressing to a finer estimate. The SPN method then uses a novel Gauss-Newton
algorithm to estimate the position by using the constraints imposed by the
detected 2D bounding box and the estimated attitude. The secondary contribution
of this work is the generation of the Spacecraft PosE Estimation Dataset
(SPEED). SPEED consists of synthetic as well as actual camera images of a
mock-up of the Tango spacecraft from the PRISMA mission. The synthetic images
are created by fusing OpenGL-based renderings of the spacecraft's 3D model with
actual images of the Earth captured by the Himawari-8 meteorological satellite.
The actual camera images are created using a 7 degrees-of-freedom robotic arm,
which positions and orients a vision-based sensor with respect to a full-scale
mock-up of the Tango spacecraft. The SPN method, trained only on synthetic
images, produces degree-level attitude error and cm-level position errors when
evaluated on the actual camera images not used during training.

parameter that can be expressed as a function of the density operator, such as
the expectation value of an observable, the fidelity to a pure state, the
purity, or the von Neumann entropy. Potential applications include quantum
state characterization for many-body systems, optical imaging, and
interferometry, where full tomography of the quantum state is often infeasible
and only a few select properties of the system are of interest.

transistors and blue LEDs, for its extraordinary properties. SiC would be
attractive for more applications, but large-scale or large-surface area
fabrication, with control over defects and surface is challenging. Sol-gel
based techniques are an affordable alternative towards such requirements. This
report describes two types of microcrystalline SiC derived after carbothermal
reduction from sol-gel-based precursors, one with nitrogen added, the other
aluminum. Characterization of their bulk, structure and surface shows that
incorporation of dopants affects the formation of polytypes and surface
chemistry. Nitrogen leads exclusively to cubic SiC, exhibiting a native oxide
surface. Presence of aluminum instead promotes growth of hexagonal polytypes
and induces self-passivation of the crystallites surface during growth. This is
established by hydrogenation of silicon bonds and formation of a protecting
aluminum carbonate species. XPS provides support for the suggested mechanism.
This passivation is achieved in only one step, solely by aluminium in the
precursor. Hence, it is shown that growth, doping and passivation of SiC can be
performed as one-pot synthesis. Material without insulating oxide and a limited
number of defects is highly valuable for applications involving
surface-sensitive charge-transfer reactions, therefore the potential of this
method is significant.

mapping. Moreover, text-to-speech synthesizers were shown to produce higher
quality speech when using a continuous pitch estimate, which takes non-zero
pitch values even when voicing is not present. Therefore, in this paper on
UTI-based SSI, we use a simple continuous F0 tracker which does not apply a
strict voiced / unvoiced decision. Continuous vocoder parameters (ContF0,
Maximum Voiced Frequency and Mel-Generalized Cepstrum) are predicted using a
convolutional neural network, with UTI as input. The results demonstrate that
during the articulatory-to-acoustic mapping experiments, the continuous F0 is
predicted with lower error, and the continuous vocoder produces slightly more
natural synthesized speech than the baseline vocoder using standard
discontinuous F0.

Energy Sharing of Prosumers on Constrained Networks","13 pages, 7 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The advent of intelligent agents who produce and consume energy by themselves
has led the smart grid into the era of ""prosumer"", offering the energy system
and customers a unique opportunity to revaluate/trade their spot energy via a
sharing initiative. To this end, designing an appropriate sharing mechanism is
an issue with crucial importance and has captured great attention. This paper
addresses the prosumers' demand response problem via energy sharing. Under a
general supply-demand function bidding scheme, a sharing market clearing
procedure considering network constraints is proposed, which gives rise to a
generalized Nash game. The existence and uniqueness of market equilibrium are
proved in non-congested cases. When congestion occurs, infinitely much
equilibrium may exist because the strategy spaces of prosumers are correlated.
A price-regulation procedure is introduced in the sharing mechanism, which
outcomes a unique equilibrium that is fair to all participants. Properties of
the improved sharing mechanism, including the individual rational behaviors of
prosumers and the components of sharing price, are revealed. When the number of
prosumers increases, the proposed sharing mechanism approaches social optimum.
Even with fixed number of resources, introducing competition can result in a
decreasing social cost. Illustrative examples validate the theoretical results
and provide more insights for the energy sharing research.

lower losses and better control over the scattering patterns compared to their
plasmonic metallic counterparts. The emergence of several resonances in those
systems results in an overall high complexity, where the electric and magnetic
dipoles have significant overlap in the case of spherical symmetry, thus
concealing the contributions of each resonance separately. Here we show,
experimentally and theoretically, the emergence of strong light-matter coupling
between the magnetic and electric-dipole resonances of individual silicon
nanodisks coupled to a J-aggregated organic semiconductor resonating at optical
frequencies, evidencing how the different properties of the two resonances
results in two different coupling strengths. The energy splittings observed are
of the same order of magnitude as in similar plasmonic systems, thus confirming
dielectric nanoparticles as promising alternatives for localized strong

the historical data of the particular route. We propose a system that generates
ETA information for a trip and updates it as the trip progresses based on the
real-time information. We train a deep learning based generative model that
learns the probability distribution of ETA data across trips and conditional on
the current trip information updates the ETA information on the go. Our plug
and play model not only captures the non-linearity of the task well but that
any transit agency can use without needing any other external data source. The
experiments run over three routes, data collected in the city of Delhi
illustrates the promise of our approach.

globally trained time-series forecasting models. The ARU combines the
advantages of learning complex data transformations across multiple time series
from deep global models, with per-series localization offered by closed-form
linear models. Unlike existing methods of adaptation that are either
memory-intensive or non-responsive after training, ARUs require only fixed
sized state and adapt to streaming data via an easy RNN-like update operation.
The core principle driving ARU is simple --- maintain sufficient statistics of
conditional Gaussian distributions and use them to compute local parameters in
closed form. Our contribution is in embedding such local linear models in
globally trained deep models while allowing end-to-end training on the one
hand, and easy RNN-like updates on the other. Across several datasets we show
that ARU is more effective than recently proposed local adaptation methods that
tax the global network to compute local parameters.

measuring nuclear modification factors as a function of transverse momentum and

$p$$+$Al and $p$$+$Au collisions, a suppression (enhancement) is observed at
forward (backward) rapidity compared to the binary scaled yields in $p$+$p$

$p$$+$Au collisions than in $p$$+$Al collisions, which have a smaller number of
participating nucleons. However, the results at forward rapidity show a similar
suppression within uncertainties. The results in the integrated centrality are
compared with calculations using nuclear parton distribution functions, which
show a reasonable agreement at the forward rapidity but fail to describe the

abundances in the prototypical photodissociation region (PDR) the Horsehead
nebula to gain insight into sulphur chemistry in UV irradiated regions. Based
on the WHISPER millimeter (mm) line survey, our goal is to provide an improved
and more accurate description of sulphur species and their abundances towards
the core and PDR positions in the Horsehead.
  Methods. The Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) methodology and the molecular
excitation and radiative transfer code RADEX were used to explore the parameter
space and determine physical conditions and beam-averaged molecular abundances.
  Results. A total of 13 S-bearing species (CS, SO, SO2, OCS, H2CS - both ortho
and para - HDCS, C2S, HCS+, SO+, H2S, S2H, NS and NS+) have been detected in
the two targeted positions. This is the first detection of SO+ in the Horsehead
and the first detection of NS+ in any PDR. We find a differentiated chemical
behaviour between C-S and O-S bearing species within the nebula. The C-S
bearing species C2S and o-H2CS present fractional abundances a factor grater
than two higher in the core than in the PDR. In contrast, the O-S bearing
molecules SO, SO2, and OCS present similar abundances towards both positions. A
few molecules, SO+, NS, and NS+, are more abundant towards the PDR than towards
the core, and could be considered as PDR tracers.
  Conclusions. This is the first complete study of S-bearing species towards a
PDR. Our study shows that CS, SO, and H2S are the most abundant S-bearing
molecules in the PDR with abundances of a few 1E-9. We recall that SH, SH+, S,
and S+ are not observable at the wavelengths covered by the WHISPER survey. At
the spatial scale of our observations, the total abundance of S atoms locked in
the detected species is < 1E-8, only ~0.1% of the cosmic sulphur abundance.

geometric parameters which are special case of isothermal parameters. With
respect to such parameters the surface is determined uniquely up to a motion by
the Gauss curvature and the curvature of the normal connection, which satisfy a
system of two PDE's (the system of natural PDE's).
  For any maximal space-like surface parametrized by canonical parameters we
obtain a special Weierstrass representation -- canonical Weierstrass
representation. These Weierstrass formulas allow us to solve explicitly the
system of natural PDE's by virtue of two holomorphic functions in the Gauss
plane. We find the relation between two pairs of holomorphic functions
generating one and the same solution to the system of natural PDE's.
  We establish a geometric correspondence between the maximal space-like
surfaces of general type in $\RR^4_2$, the solutions to the system of natural
PDE's and the pairs of holomorphic functions in the Gauss plane. We prove that
any maximal space-like surface in the four-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean space

performance of action recognition is highly dependent on the type of features
being extracted and how the actions are represented. Since the release of the
Kinect camera, a large number of Kinect-based human action recognition
techniques have been proposed in the literature. However, there still does not
exist a thorough comparison of these Kinect-based techniques under the grouping
of feature types, such as handcrafted versus deep learning features and
depth-based versus skeleton-based features. In this paper, we analyze and
compare ten recent Kinect-based algorithms for both cross-subject action
recognition and cross-view action recognition using six benchmark datasets. In
addition, we have implemented and improved some of these techniques and
included their variants in the comparison. Our experiments show that the
majority of methods perform better on cross-subject action recognition than
cross-view action recognition, that skeleton-based features are more robust for
cross-view recognition than depth-based features, and that deep learning
features are suitable for large datasets.

thermal transport characteristics in $\Phi^4$ chains. The particles of the
modified chain, henceforth termed as the $\Phi^{4C}$ chain, can collide with
each other. Collisions have been modelled by adding a short-ranged soft-sphere
potential to the Hamiltonian of the $\Phi^4$ chain. The inclusion of
soft-sphere potential drastically alters the thermal transport characteristics
while still satisfying the Fourier's law: at low temperatures, the temperature
profile has negligible boundary jumps in $\Phi^{4C}$ chains, thermal
conductivity of $\Phi^{4C}$ chains is significantly smaller than $\Phi^4$
chains at low temperatures, at high temperatures, $\Phi^{4C}$ chains have a
higher thermal conductivity than $\Phi^4$ chains, and unlike $\Phi^4$ chains,
where thermal conductivity keeps decreasing upon increasing temperature, in
$\Phi^{4C}$ chains thermal conductivity abruptly decreases first and then
increases beyond an inversion temperature. Splitting the total heat current
into the contributions of the harmonic and anharmonic inter-particle forces,
reveals that the harmonic contributions decrease with increasing temperature.
On the contrary, anharmonic contributions increase with rising temperature, and
beyond the inversion temperature they overtake the harmonic contributions.
Exploring the dynamics in Fourier space helps in identifying that the energy of
the lowest modes redistribute to other modes much faster in $\Phi^{4C}$ chains
due to collisions. The quicker redistribution of the energy to higher modes is
the reason behind smaller thermal conductivity in $\Phi^{4C}$ chains at low
temperatures. The proposed $\Phi^{4C}$ chains have the features of both
momentum conserving as well as momentum non-conserving systems, and may become
an important tool to study thermal transport in real-life systems.

non-associativity of the representation product in a peculiar channel $R\otimes

symmetric and orthogonal, and therefore admit two decompositions: as quadratic
forms, $\bar S \sim {\cal E}^{tr}{\cal E}$, and as operators: $\bar T\bar S\bar
T = S T^{-1} S^{-1}$. Here $\bar T$ and $T$ consist of the eigenvalues of the
quantum ${\cal R}$-matrices in channels $R\otimes \bar R$ and $R\otimes R$

${\cal E}$ is a {\it triangular} matrix. It can be further used to construct
the KNTZ evolution matrix ${\cal B}={\cal E}\bar T^2{\cal E}^{-1}$, which is
also triangular and explicitly expressible through the skew Schur and Macdonald
functions -- what makes Racah matrices calculable. Moreover, ${\cal B}$ is
somewhat similar to Ruijsenaars Hamiltonian, which is used to define Macdonald
functions, and gets triangular in the Schur basis. Discovery of this pentad

changes of the nanopillars depend on irradiation-induced amorphization and
thermally driven dynamic annealing. While at room temperature, the nanopillars
evolve to a conical shape due to ion-induced plastic deformation and viscous
flow of amorphized Si, simultaneous dynamic annealing during the irradiation at
elevated temperatures prevents amorphization which is necessary for the viscous
flow. Above the critical temperature of ion-induced amorphization, a steady
decrease of the diameter was observed as a result of the dominating forward

then include the yields in our galactic chemical evolution code to predict the
evolution of elemental abundances in the solar neighborhood and dwarf
spheroidal (dSph) galaxies: Fornax, Sculptor, Sextans, and Carina. In the
observations of the solar neighborhood stars, Mn shows an opposite trend to
$\alpha$ elements, showing an increase toward higher metallicities, which is
very well reproduced by deflagration-detonation transition of Ch-mass WDs, but
never by double detonations of sub-Ch-mass WDs alone. The problem of Ch-mass
SNe Ia was the Ni over-production at high metallicities. However, we found that
Ni yields of Ch-mass SNe Ia are much lower with the solar-scaled initial
composition than in previous works, which keeps the predicted Ni abundance
within the observational scatter. From the evolutionary trends of elemental
abundances in the solar neighborhood, we conclude that the contribution of
sub-Ch-mass SNe Ia in chemical enrichment is up to 25\%. In dSph galaxies,
however, larger enrichment from sub-Ch-mass SNe Ia than in the solar
neighborhood may be required, which causes a decrease in [(Mg, Cr, Mn, Ni)/Fe]
at lower metallicities. The observed high [Mn/Fe] ratios in Sculptor and Carina
may also require additional enrichment from pure deflagrations, possibly as

Data. A first important step is to identify temporal correlations between data
sets. Given the characteristics of Big Data in terms of volume and velocity,
techniques that identify correlations not only need to be fast and scalable,
but also need to help users in ordering the correlations across temporal scales
so that they can focus on important relationships. In this paper, we present
AMIC (Adaptive Mutual Information-based Correlation), a method based on mutual
information to identify correlations at multiple temporal scales in large time
series. Discovered correlations are suggested to users in an order based on the
strength of the relationships. Our method supports an adaptive streaming
technique that minimizes duplicated computation and is implemented on top of
Apache Spark for scalability. We also provide a comprehensive evaluation on the
effectiveness and the scalability of AMIC using both synthetic and real-world
data sets.

makes it a very challenging problem. In this context, the Brain Imaging Data
Structure (BIDS) appears as a solution for organising and describing
neuroimaging datasets. Since its publication in 2015, BIDS has gained
widespread attention in the field, as it provides a common way to arrange and
share multimodal brain images. Although the evident benefits it presents, BIDS
has not been widely adopted in the field of MRI yet and we believe that this is
due to the lack of a go-to tool to create and managed BIDS datasets. Motivated
by this, we present the BIDS Toolbox, a web service to manage brain imaging
datasets in BIDS format. Different from other tools, the BIDS Toolbox allows
the creation and modification of BIDS-compliant datasets based on MRI data. It
provides both a web interface and REST endpoints for its use. In this paper we
describe its design and early prototype, and provide a link to the public

SrFeO3 exhibits features in its magnetoresistance that are consistent with its

SrFeO3 measured at the Fe L edge resonance energy asymmetrically broadens with
decreasing temperature in its multi-q state. In contrast, insulating CaFeO3 has
a symmetric scattering peak with an intensity 10x weaker than SrFeO3. Enhanced
magnetic scattering at O K edge prepeak energies demonstrates the role of a
negative charge transfer energy and the resulting oxygen ligand holes in the
magnetic ordering of these ferrates. By measuring magnetic diffraction of
CaFeO3/SrFeO3 superlattices with thick CaFeO3 layers, we find that the CaFeO3
helical ordering is coherent across 1 unit cell-thick SrFeO3 layers but not 6

overcome this in endoscopic approaches, hyperrealistic concepts have been
proposed to be used in an augmented reality-setting, which are based on deep
image-to-image transformation methods. Such concepts are able to generate
realistic representations of phantoms learned from real intraoperative
endoscopic sequences. Conditioned on frames from the surgical training process,
the learned models are able to generate impressive results by transforming
unrealistic parts of the image (e.g.\ the uniform phantom texture is replaced
by the more heterogeneous texture of the tissue). Image-to-image synthesis
usually learns a mapping $G:X~\to~Y$ such that the distribution of images from
$G(X)$ is indistinguishable from the distribution $Y$. However, it does not
necessarily force the generated images to be consistent and without artifacts.
In the endoscopic image domain this can affect depth cues and stereo
consistency of a stereo image pair, which ultimately impairs surgical vision.
We propose a cross-domain conditional generative adversarial network approach
(GAN) that aims to generate more consistent stereo pairs. The results show
substantial improvements in depth perception and realism evaluated by 3 domain

properties of real cluster data through the two-component modelling of the

here the maxima bending increases when $n$ decreases, suggesting that
$\epsilon$-near-zero metamaterials can enhance optical gyroscopes and

one may expect that a wave that travels faster would bend less. The apparent
contradiction is clarified via the Minkowski momentum picture for a

classical and quantum experiments. Integrated components allow for compact,
modular and stable light-processing systems and as such their use in real-world
systems continues to expand. In order to use these devices in the most
demanding applications, where efficiency and/or spectral performance are
critical, it is important that the devices are fully optimized. In order to
achieve these optimizations, it is first necessary to gain a thorough
understanding of current fabrication limits and their impact on the devices
final performance. In this paper we investigate the current fabrication limits
of titanium in-diffused lithium niobate waveguides produced using a masked
photolithographic method. By dicing a long (~cm) sample into smaller pieces and
recording the resulting phasematching spectra, the fabrication error present in
the UV photolithographic process is characterized. The retrieved imperfections
fit well with theoretical expectations and from the measured imperfection
profile it is shown that one can directly reconstruct the original distorted
phasematching spectrum. Therefore, our measurements directly quantify the
intrinsic limitations of the current standard UV photolitographic technique for
the realization of integrated waveguides in lithium niobate.

computer aided diagnosis (CAD) in medical imaging, DNA microarrays in genomics,
optical character recognition (OCR), speech recognition (SR), spam email

ML; diverse fields but one theory. In particular, ML has gained a lot of
attention in the field of cyberphysical security, especially in the last
decade. It is of great importance to this field to design detection algorithms
that have the capability of learning from security data to be able to hunt
threats, achieve better monitoring, master the complexity of the threat
intelligence feeds, and achieve timely remediation of security incidents. The
field of ML can be decomposed into two basic subfields: \textit{construction}
and \textit{assessment}. We mean by \textit{construction} designing or
inventing an appropriate algorithm that learns from the input data and achieves
a good performance according to some optimality criterion. We mean by
\textit{assessment} attributing some performance measures to the constructed ML
algorithm, along with their estimators, to objectively assess this algorithm.
\textit{Construction} and \textit{assessment} of a ML algorithm require
familiarity with different other fields: probability, statistics, matrix
theory, optimization, algorithms, and programming, among others.f

large Kerr nonlinearity, realized here using the nonlinear kinetic inductance
of a large array of Josephson junctions. The experimentally measured nonlinear
resonance lineshapes of the junction array modes show significant deviations
from steady-state numerical predictions, and necessitate time-dependent
numerical simulations indicative of strong measurement-induced dephasing in the
system arising from the large cross-Kerr effect between array modes. Analytical
and numerical calculations of switching rate corroborate this by showing the
emergence of a slow time scale, which is much longer than the linear decay rate
and is set by fluctuation-induced switching times in the bistable regime.
Furthermore, our analysis shows that the usual quantum-activated escape
treatment is inadequate for prediction of the switching rates at large
frequency shifts caused by strong nonlinearities, necessitating a quantum
treatment that utilizes the full system Liouvillian. Based on our analysis, we
identify a universal crossover parameter that delineates the regimes of
validity of semiclassical and quantum descriptions, respectively. Our work
shows how dynamical switching effects in strongly nonlinear systems provide a

the neutron decay in experiments with trapped ultracold neutrons. Conversely,
this effect is basically undetectable in experiments in which the neutron
lifetime is measured by measuring the decays of beams of neutrons. As a test of
our claim, we propose a simple qualitative correlation between the number of
neutrons in the trap and the neutron lifetime: the larger the number, the
faster the decay. Finally we discuss also the presently available measurements

critical importance both in statistical network theory and across multiple
application domains. Although single-graph inference is well-studied, multiple
graph inference is largely unexplored, in part because of the challenges
inherent in appropriately modeling graph differences and yet retaining
sufficient model simplicity to render estimation feasible. This paper addresses
exactly this gap, by introducing a new model, the common subspace
independent-edge (COSIE) multiple random graph model, which describes a
heterogeneous collection of networks with a shared latent structure on the
vertices but potentially different connectivity patterns for each graph. The
COSIE model encompasses many popular network representations, including the
stochastic blockmodel. The model is both flexible enough to meaningfully
account for important graph differences and tractable enough to allow for
accurate inference in multiple networks. In particular, a joint spectral
embedding of adjacency matrices - the multiple adjacency spectral embedding
(MASE) - leads, in a COSIE model, to simultaneous consistent estimation of
underlying parameters for each graph. Under mild additional assumptions, MASE
estimates satisfy asymptotic normality and yield improvements for graph
eigenvalue estimation and hypothesis testing. In both simulated and real data,
the COSIE model and the MASE embedding can be deployed for a number of
subsequent network inference tasks, including dimensionality reduction,
classification, hypothesis testing and community detection. Specifically, when
MASE is applied to a dataset of connectomes constructed through diffusion
magnetic resonance imaging, the result is an accurate classification of brain
scans by patient and a meaningful determination of heterogeneity across scans
of different subjects.

equivalence principle motivates a geometrical description of gravity. The
standard formulation of General Relativity \`a la Einstein attributes gravity
to the spacetime curvature, to which we have grown accustomed. However, this
perception has masked the fact that two alternative, though equivalent,
formulations of General Relativity in flat spacetimes exist, where gravity can
be fully ascribed either to torsion or to non-metricity. The latter allows a
simpler geometrical formulation of General Relativity that is oblivious to the
affine spacetime structure. Generalisations along this line permit to generate
teleparallel and symmetric teleparallel theories of gravity with exceptional
properties. In this work we explore modified gravity theories based on
non-linear extensions of the non-metricity scalar. After presenting some
general properties and briefly studying some interesting background cosmologies
(including accelerating solutions with relevance for inflation and dark
energy), we analyse the behaviour of the cosmological perturbations. Tensor
perturbations feature a re-scaling of the corresponding Newton's constant,
while vector perturbations do not contribute in the absence of vector sources.
In the scalar sector we find two additional propagating modes, hinting that
$f(Q)$ theories introduce, at least, two additional degrees of freedom. These
scalar modes disappear around maximally symmetric backgrounds because of the
appearance of an accidental residual gauge symmetry corresponding to a
restricted diffeomorphism. We finally discuss the potential strong coupling
problems of these maximally symmetric backgrounds caused by the discontinuity
in the number of propagating modes.

but the models used in the market definition have not developed much in the
past three decades since the Critical Loss Analysis (CLA) was proposed in 1989.
The CLA helps the Hypothetical Monopolist Test to determine whether the
hypothetical monopolist is going to profit from the small but significant and
non-transitory increase in price (SSNIP). However, the CLA has long been
criticized by academic scholars for its tendency to conclude a narrow market.
Although the CLA was adopted by the 2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines (the 2010
Guidelines), the criticisms are likely still valid. In this dissertation, we
discussed the mathematical deduction of CLA, the data used, and the SSNIP
defined by the Agencies. Based on our research, we concluded that the narrow
market conclusion was due to the incorrect implementation of the CLA; not the
model itself. On the other hand, there are other unresolvable problems in the
CLA and the Hypothetical Monopolist Test. The SSNIP test and the CLA are bright
resolutions for market definition problem during their time, but we have more
advanced tools to solve the task nowadays. In this dissertation, we propose a
model which is based directly on the multi-dimensional substitutability between
the products and is capable of maximizing the substitutability of product
features within each group. Since the 2010 Guidelines does not exclude the use
of models other than the ones mentioned by the Guidelines, our method can
hopefully supplement the current models to show a better picture of the
substitutive relations and provide a more stable definition of the market.

train and test machine learning models, which are often data hungry. While some
languages, e.g., English, have a vast array of these resources, most
under-resourced languages do not, especially for fine-grained sentiment tasks,
such as aspect-level or targeted sentiment analysis. To improve this situation,
we propose a cross-lingual approach to sentiment analysis that is applicable to
under-resourced languages and takes into account target-level information. This
model incorporates sentiment information into bilingual distributional
representations, by jointly optimizing them for semantics and sentiment,
showing state-of-the-art performance at sentence-level when combined with
machine translation. The adaptation to targeted sentiment analysis on multiple
domains shows that our model outperforms other projection-based bilingual
embedding methods on binary targeted sentiment tasks. Our analysis on ten
languages demonstrates that the amount of unlabeled monolingual data has
surprisingly little effect on the sentiment results. As expected, the choice of
annotated source language for projection to a target leads to better results
for source-target language pairs which are similar. Therefore, our results
suggest that more efforts should be spent on the creation of resources for less
similar languages to those which are resource-rich already. Finally, a domain
mismatch leads to a decreased performance. This suggests resources in any
language should ideally cover varieties of domains.

methods (PNMs) are obtained when Bayesian statistical principles are deployed.
Bayesian PNM have the appealing property of being closed under composition,
such that uncertainty due to different sources of discretisation in a numerical
method can be jointly modelled and rigorously propagated. Despite recent
attention, no exact Bayesian PNM for the numerical solution of ordinary

Bayesian PNM is proposed as a proof-of-concept. Our proposal is a synthesis of
classical Lie group methods, to exploit underlying symmetries in the gradient

ODE. The procedure is presented in detail for first and second order ODEs and
relies on a certain strong technical condition -- existence of a solvable Lie

currents and will normally experience Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV), which
can cause fast accumulation of fatigue damage. The ocean current is often
three-dimensional (3D), i.e., the direction and magnitude of the current vary
throughout the water column. Today, semi-empirical tools are used by the
industry to predict VIV induced fatigue on risers. The load model and
hydrodynamic parameters in present VIV prediction tools are developed based on
two-dimensional (2D) flow conditions, as it is challenging to consider the
effect of 3D flow along the risers. Accordingly, the current profiles must be
purposely made 2D during the design process, which leads to significant
uncertainty in the prediction results. Further, due to the limitations in the
laboratory, VIV model tests are mostly carried out under 2D flow conditions and
thus little experimental data exist to document VIV response of riser subjected
to varying directions of the current. However, a few experiments have been
conducted with 3D current. We have used results from one of these experiments
to investigate how well 1) traditional and 2) an alternative method based on a
data driven prediction can describe VIV in 3D currents. Data driven modelling
is particularly suited for complicated problems with many parameters and
non-linear relationships. We have applied a data clustering algorithm to the
experimental 3D flow data in order to identify measurable parameters that can
influence responses. The riser responses are grouped based on their statistical
characteristics, which relate to the direction of the flow. Furthermore we fit
a random forest regression model to the measured VIV response and compare its
performance with the predictions of existing VIV prediction tools (VIVANA-FD).

model is trained on the modal coefficients extracted from the high-resolution
data using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) transform, and (ii) in the
testing phase, the trained model predicts the modal coefficients for the total
time recursively based on the initial time history. To illustrate the
predictive performance of the proposed framework, the mean flow fields and time
series response of the field values are reconstructed from the predicted modal
coefficients by using an inverse POD transform. As a representative benchmark
test case, we consider a two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic (QG) ocean
circulation model which, in general, displays an enormous range of fluctuating
spatial and temporal scales. We first illustrate that the conventional Galerkin
projection based ROM of such systems requires a high number of POD modes to
obtain a stable flow physics. In addition, ROM-GP does not seem to capture the
intermittent bursts appearing in the dynamics of the first few most energetic
modes. However, the proposed non-intrusive ROM framework based on LSTM
(ROM-LSTM) yields a stable solution even for a small number of POD modes. We
also observe that the ROM-LSTM model is able to capture quasi-periodic
intermittent bursts accurately, and yields a stable and accurate mean flow
dynamics using the time history of a few previous time states, denoted as the
lookback time-window in this paper. Our findings suggest that the proposed ROM
framework is capable of predicting noisy nonlinear fluid flows in an extremely

  Attention-GRU","9 pages, 6 figures, submitted to CIKM 2019 Applied Research Track",,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, interactive recommender systems are becoming increasingly popular.
The insight is that, with the interaction between users and the system, (1)
users can actively intervene the recommendation results rather than passively
receive them, and (2) the system learns more about users so as to provide
better recommendation.
  We focus on the single-round interaction, i.e. the system asks the user a
question (Step 1), and exploits his feedback to generate better recommendation
(Step 2). A novel query-based interactive recommender system is proposed in
this paper, where \textbf{personalized questions are accurately generated from
millions of automatically constructed questions} in Step 1, and \textbf{the
recommendation is ensured to be closely-related to users' feedback} in Step 2.
We achieve this by transforming Step 1 into a query recommendation task and
Step 2 into a retrieval task. The former task is our key challenge. We firstly
propose a model based on Meta-Path to efficiently retrieve hundreds of query
candidates from the large query pool. Then an adapted Attention-GRU model is
developed to effectively rank these candidates for recommendation. Offline and
online experiments on Taobao, a large-scale e-commerce platform in China,
verify the effectiveness of our interactive system. The system has already gone
into production in the homepage of Taobao App since Nov. 11, 2018 (see
https://v.qq.com/x/page/s0833tkp1uo.html on how it works online). Our code and
dataset are public in https://github.com/zyody/QueryQR.

  a high temperature study",,,"10.1088/1361-6463/ab4842",,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report the high temperature impedance and dielectric measurement of the
nanocomposites comprising of CoFe2O4 (CFO) and LaNiO3 (LNO) by changing the
content of LaNiO3 (0, 5, 10 and 15 %). The aim of the present study is to
relate the structural defects expected at the interfaces of the composites with
the result of impedance and dielectrics. The result separately shows the grain,
grain boundary and electrode relaxation behaviour in the impedance and modulus
spectroscopy. As calculated using Arrhenius law it indicates a reduced
activation energy of the grain boundary in the presence of LNO compared to pure
CFO. This assists the charge carriers for short range hopping across the
boundary as reflected from ac conductivity. The dielectric constant at high
frequency side manifests the interband transition in both pure CFO and the
composite materials. The frequency of the transition can be tuned by LNO
content. Thus this detail study will help to understand the relaxation
phenomenon and dielectric behaviour in the presence of structural defects and
disorder.

users. The workers receive a compensation for their work according to the
serious of the tasks they managed to accomplish. The evaluation of the quality
of responses obtained from the crowd remains one of the most important problems
in this context. Several methods have been proposed to estimate the expertise
level of crowd workers. We propose an innovative measure of expertise assuming
that we possess a dataset with an objective comparison of the items concerned.
Our method is based on the definition of four factors with the theory of belief
functions. We compare our method to the Fagin distance on a dataset from a real
experiment, where users have to assess the quality of some audio recordings.
Then, we propose to fuse both the Fagin distance and our expertise measure.

renewable energy resources and an efficient photovoltaic device is required to
convert this energy into utilizable energy. Different types of solar cells (SC)
are commercially available. However, various parameters need to be optimized to
get maximum efficiency from a SC. In this study we have presented a SC model in
which dependence of quantum efficiency (QE) on various parameters has been
investigated. The mobility of the carriers has been varied with wide range
along with the carrier life time (LT). Results show that maximum efficiencies
can be achieved up to 11.10% and 10.81% keeping the electron and hole mobility
to be 1500 cm2V-1s-1 and 300 cm2V-1s-1 respectively with electron and hole
carrier LT to be 3ns and 7ns respectively. The effect of surface recombination
velocity (SRV) has also been brought under observation and the maximum
efficiency is found to be 13.75% at electron and hole SRV equal to be 103ms-1.
Results shows that the higher photovoltaic efficiencies can be achieved by
increasing the mobility and carrier LT while decreasing the surface
recombination velocities.

devices, as smallest local inhomogeneities can change the entire behaviour of
identically built devices without showing obvious failure. Inhomogeneities can
occur at various steps of device preparation and appear in all layers with
different length scales and impact. The hole-transport interlayer (HTL) in OPV
devices blocks unwanted electron diffusion to the anode and corrects energetic
mismatch between oxide electrode and organic semiconductor. Most commonly used
is commercial ink based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT PSS) colloidal particles. However, exactly these
are suspected to cause microscopic inhomogeneities, causing known
irreproducibility of device characteristics. Considering PEDOT:PSS
acidity-caused electrode corrosion, it is questionable how much impact colloids
have on device homogeneity. In this report, we give proof that a colloidal HTL
does not necessarily cause device inhomogeneity and decreased efficiency, by
comparing OPV devices with different HTLs, namely from commercial PEDOT:PSS ink
and from MoO3, obtained from two liquid precursors, leading to quasi-continuous
or colloidal layers. With a combination of X-ray diffraction, atomic force and
Kelvin probe microscopy, photoelectron and ambient air photoemission
spectroscopy, we discuss the layers properties from nano- to macroscale and
demonstrate their impact upon implementation into OPV devices, via
spatially-resolved characterization.

10%, the control of stability and degradation mechanisms of solar cells became
a prominent task. The improvement of device efficiency due to incorporation of
a hole-transport layer (HTL) in bulk-heterojunction solar cells has been
extensively reported. However, the most widely used HTL material, PEDOT:PSS is
frequently suspected to be the dominating source for devices instability under
environmental conditions. Thereby effects like photooxidation and electrode
corrosion are often reported to shorten device lifetime. However, often in
environmental device studies, the source of degradation, whether being from the
HTL, the active layer or the metal cathode are rather difficult to distinguish,
because the external diffusion of oxygen and water affects all components. In
this study, different HTLs, namely prepared from traditional PEDOT:PSS and also
two types of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3), are exposed to different environments
such as oxygen, light or humidity, prior to device finalization under inert
conditions. This allows investigating any effects within the HTL and from
reactions at its interface to the indium-tin-oxide electrode or the active
layer. The surface and bulk chemistry of the exposed HTL has been monitored and
discussed in context to the observed device physics, dynamic charge transport
and spatial performance homogeneity of the according OPV device. The results
show that merely humidity-exposure of the HTL leads to decreased device
performance for PEDOT:PSS, but also for one type of the tested MoO3. The losses
are related to the amount of absorbed water in the HTL, inducing loss of active
area in terms of interfacial contact. The device with PEDOT:PSS HTL after humid
air exposure showed seriously decreased photocurrent by micro-delamination of
swelling/shrinkage of the hygroscopic layer.
