dithering methods such as epsilon-greedy sampling are insufficient to solve a
given task. Many recent methods have proposed to intrinsically motivate an
agent to seek novel states, driving the agent to discover improved reward.
However, while state-novelty exploration methods are suitable for tasks where
novel observations correlate well with improved reward, they may not explore
more efficiently than epsilon-greedy approaches in environments where the two
are not well-correlated. In this paper, we distinguish between exploration
tasks in which seeking novel states aids in finding new reward, and those where
it does not, such as goal-conditioned tasks and escaping local reward maxima.
We propose a new exploration objective, maximizing the reward prediction error
(RPE) of a value function trained to predict extrinsic reward. We then propose
a deep reinforcement learning method, QXplore, which exploits the temporal
difference error of a Q-function to solve hard exploration tasks in
high-dimensional MDPs. We demonstrate the exploration behavior of QXplore on
several OpenAI Gym MuJoCo tasks and Atari games and observe that QXplore is
comparable to or better than a baseline state-novelty method in all cases,
outperforming the baseline on tasks where state novelty is not well-correlated

detection of the respiration rate from video sequences. Common techniques
either directly assess the movement of the chest due to breathing or are based
on analyzing subtle color changes that occur as a result of hemodynamic
properties of the skin tissue by means of remote photoplethysmography (rPPG).
However, extracting hemodynamic parameters from rPPG is often difficult
especially if the skin is not visible to the camera. In contrast, extracting
respiratory signals from chest movements turned out to be a robust method.
However, the detectability of chest regions cannot be guaranteed in any
application scenario, for instance if the camera setting is optimized to
provide close-up images of the head. In such a case an alternative method for
respiration detection is required.
  It is reasonable to assume that the mechanical coupling between chest and
head induces minor movements of the head which, like in rPPG, can be detected
from subtle color changes as well. Although the strength of these movements is
expected to be much smaller in scale, sensing these intensity variations could
provide a reasonably suited respiration signal for subsequent respiratory rate
analysis.
  In order to investigate this coupling we conducted an experimental study with
12 subjects and applied motion- and rPPG-based methods to estimate the
respiratory frequency from both head regions and chest. Our results show that
it is possible to derive signals correlated to chest movement from facial
regions. The method is a feasible alternative to rPPG-based respiratory rate
estimations when rPPG-signals cannot be derived reliably and chest movement
detection cannot be applied as well.

  In this paper we consider a particular kind of cosmological perturbation
theory which starts from a gauge fixed version of General Relativity. The gauge
fixing is performed using a material reference system called Gaussian dust. The
resulting system has no constraints any more but possesses a physical
Hamiltonian that drives the dynamics of both geometry and matter. As observable
matter content we restrict to a scalar field (inflaton). We then explore the
sector of that theory which is purely homogeneous and isotropic with respect to
the geometry degrees of freedom but contains inhomogeneous perturbations up to
second order of the scalar field.
  The purpose of this paper is to explore the quantum field theoretical
challenges of the space adiabatic framework in a cosmological model of
inflation which is technically still relatively simple. We compute the quantum
backreaction effects from every energy band of the inhomogeneous matter modes
on the evolution of the homogeneous geometry up to second order in the
adiabatic parameter. These contributions turn out to be significant due to the
infinite number of degrees of freedom and are very sensitive to the choice of
Fock representation chosen for the inhomogeneous matter modes.

multi-shot EPI sequence for rapid simultaneous quantification of T1 and T2
parameters. Methods: The proposed Cartesian MRF method involved the acquisition
of highly subsampled MR images using a 16-shot EPI readout. A linearly varying
flip angle train was used for rapid, simultaneous T1 and T2 quantification. The
accuracy of parametric map estimations were improved by using an iterative
projection algorithm. The results were compared to a conventional spiral MRF
implementation. The acquisition time per slice was 8s and this method was
validated on a phantom and a healthy volunteer brain in vivo. Results: Joint T1
and T2 estimations using the 16-shot EPI readout are in good agreement with the
spiral implementation using the same acquisition parameters (deviation less
than 3% for T1 and less than 4% for T2) for the healthy volunteer brain. The T1
and T2 values also agree with the conventional values previously reported in
the literature. The visual quality of the multi-parametric maps generated by
the multi-shot EPI-MRF and spiral-MRF implementations were comparable.
Conclusion: The multi-shot EPI-MRF method generated accurate quantitative
multi-parametric maps similar to conventional Spiral - MRF. This multi-shot
approach achieved provides an alternative for performing MRF using an
accelerated Cartesian readout, thereby increasing the potential usability of

M1=0.6402+/-0.0052 Msun and M2=0.6511+/-0.0052 Msun and radii of
R1=0.687^{+0.017}_{-0.024} Rsun and R2=0.672^{+0.018}_{-0.022} Rsun. Spectral
types were estimated to be K6V and K7V. These stars rotate in a circular orbit
with an orbital inclination of i=86.22+/-0.61 degrees and a period of
P=0.5607222(2) d. The distance to the system is estimated to be
d=135.2^{+7.6}_{-7.9} pc, in excellent agreement with the value from Gaia. If
solar metallicity were assumed, the age of the system would be older than
log(age)~8 based on the Mbol-log Teff diagram. NSVS 10653195 is composed of two
oversized and active K stars. While their radii is above model predictions
their Teff are in better agreement with models.

integrates an original Kullback-Leibler (KL) fairness term with a large class

different from the existing combinatorial and spectral solutions, our
variational multi-term approach enables to control the trade-off levels between
the fairness and clustering objectives. We derive a general tight upper bound
based on a concave-convex decomposition of our fairness term, its
Lipschitz-gradient property and the Pinsker's inequality. Our tight upper bound
can be jointly optimized with various clustering objectives, while yielding a
scalable solution, with convergence guarantee. Interestingly, at each
iteration, it performs an independent update for each assignment variable.
Therefore, it can be easily distributed for large-scale datasets. This
scalability is important as it enables to explore different trade-off levels
between the fairness and clustering objectives. Unlike spectral relaxation, our
formulation does not require computing its eigenvalue decomposition. We report
comprehensive evaluations and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods over
various fair-clustering benchmarks, which show that our variational formulation
can yield highly competitive solutions in terms of fairness and clustering
objectives.

system is surrounded by a circumbinary disk. We have carried out low resolution
spectroscopy in the 8-13$\mu$m range using VISIR at ESO's Very Large Telescope.
The silicate features of both sources are clearly different. The NW component
has a broad, smooth absorption profile lacking structure. The SE component
shows the silicate feature in emission, with structure longwards of 9.5$\mu$m
indicating the presence of crystalline dust in the dominant form of forsterite.
The apparent lack of an absorption feature caused by foreground dust is
probably due to the filling of the band with emission by amorphous silicates in
the envelope of the object. Despite their virtually certain coevality, the
differences in the components of the HH250-IRS binary are most likely due to
markedly different circumstellar environments. The NW component displays an
unevolved envelope, whereas dust growth and crystallization has taken place in
the SE component. The weak or absent signatures of enstatite in the latter are
fairly unusual among envelopes with crystalline dust, and we tentatively relate
it to a possible wide gap or an inner truncation of the disk already hinted in
previous observations by a drop in the $L'$-band flux, which might indicate
that the SE component could actually be a very close binary. We speculate that
the clear differences between the silicate feature spectra of both components
of HH250-IRS may be due either to disk evolution sped up by multiplicity, or by
accretion variability leading to episodes of crystal formation.

one of the most successful fields of astrophysics. Data of high quality were
obtained through the implementation of networks of ground-based observatories
such as the GONG project or the BiSON network, coupled with space-based
telescopes such as SOHO and SDO missions. Besides the improvement of
observational data, solar seismologists developed sophisticated techniques to
infer the internal structure of the Sun. These methods, then already
extensively used in the field of Geophysics, are called inversion techniques.
They allowed to determine the position of the solar convective envelope, its
helium abundance and the internal radial profiles of thermodynamic quantities.
Back in 1990s these comparisons showed a very high agreement between solar
models and the Sun. However, the downward revision of the CNO surface
abundances in the Sun induced a drastic reduction of this agreement leading to
the solar modelling problem. More than ten years later, in the era of the
space-based photometry missions which have established asteroseismology of
solar-like stars as a standard approach to obtain their masses, radii and ages,
the solar modelling problem still awaits a solution. We will present the
results of new helioseismic inversions, discuss the current uncertainties of
solar models as well as some possible solutions to the solar problem. We will
show how helioseismology can help us grasp what is amiss in our models. We will
also show that, far from being an argument about details of solar models, the
solar problem has significant implications for seismology of solar-like stars,
on the main sequence and beyond, impacting asteroseismology as a whole as well
as the fields requiring precise and accurate knowledge of stellar masses, radii
and ages, such as Galactic archaeology and exoplanetology.

Background matter is considered in the form of a perfect fluid with non-linear
equations of state both in the external/our and internal spaces and the model
is set to include an additional bare cosmological constant $\Lambda_6$. In the
weak-field approximation, the background is perturbed by pressureless
gravitating mass that is a static point-like particle. The non-linearity of the
equations of state of a perfect fluid makes it possible to solve simultaneously
a number of problems. The demand that the parameterized post-Newtonian
parameter $\gamma$ be equal to 1 in this configuration, first, ensures
compatibility with gravitational tests in the Solar system (deflection of light
and time delay of radar echoes) at the same level of accuracy as General
Relativity. Second, it translates into the absence of internal space variations
so that the gravitational potential coincides exactly with the Newtonian one,
securing the absence of the fifth force. Third, the gravitating mass remains
pressurless in the external space as in the standard approach to
non-relativistic astrophysical objects and meanwhile, acquires effective
tension in the internal space.

conundra. The sudden drop in the pressure of relativistic matter at
$W^{\pm}/Z^{0}$ decoupling, the quark--hadron transition and $e^{+}e^{-}$
annihilation enhances the probability of primordial black hole (PBH) formation
in the early Universe. Assuming the amplitude of the primordial curvature
fluctuations is approximately scale-invariant, this implies a multi-modal PBH
mass spectrum with peaks at $10^{-6}$, 1, 30, and $10^{6}\,M_{\odot}$. This
suggests a unified PBH scenario which naturally explains the dark matter and
recent microlensing observations, the LIGO/Virgo black hole mergers, the
correlations in the cosmic infrared and X-ray backgrounds, and the origin of
the supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei at high redshift. A distinctive
prediction of our model is that LIGO/Virgo should observe black hole mergers in
the mass gaps between 2 and $5\,M_{\odot}$ (where no stellar remnants are
expected) and above $65\,M_{\odot}$ (where pair-instability supernovae occur)
and low-mass-ratios in between. Therefore the recent detection of events
GW190425, GW190814 and GW190521 with these features is striking confirmation of
our prediction and may indicate a primordial origin for the black holes. In
this case, the exponential sensitivity of the PBH abundance to the equation of
state would offer a unique probe of the QCD phase transition. The detection of
PBHs would also offer a novel way to probe the existence of new particles or
phase transitions with energy between $1\,{\rm MeV}$ and $10^{10}\,$GeV.

PT-symmetric models of quantum mechanics, where the primary focus is with the
study of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that nevertheless produce countably
infinite sets of real-valued eigenvalues. One of the fundamental models of such
a system is governed by the Hamiltonian $H = \hat{p}^2 +
x^2(ix)^{\varepsilon}$. In their work, Bender & Boettcher proposed a WKB
methodology for the prediction of the discrete eigenvalues in the so-called
unbroken region of $\varepsilon > 0$. However, the authors noted that this
methodology fails to predict those 'broken' eigenvalues for $\varepsilon < 0$.
Here, we shall explain why the traditional WKB methodology fails, and we shall
demonstrate how eigenvalues for all relevant values of $\varepsilon$ can be
predicted using techniques in exponential asymptotics. These predictions
provide excellent agreement to exact numerical results over nearly the entire
range of values. Moreover, such techniques can be extended to a much wider
range PT-symmetric problems.

Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene devices are rotated relative to each other by a
small angle $\theta$. We show that at small twist angles ($\theta\sim 1^\circ$)
the effective mass of the TDBG system is greatly enhanced, leading to a
drastically increased phonon-induced resistivity in the high-temperature limit
where phonon scattering leads to a linearly increasing resistivity with
increasing temperature. We also discuss possible implications of our theory on
superconductivity in such a system, and provide an order of magnitude
estimation of the superconducting transition temperature.

have attracted a tremendous amount of attention in recent years. However, most
of the computational approaches of OT do not learn the underlying transport
map. Although some algorithms have been proposed to learn this map, they rely
on kernel-based methods, which makes them prohibitively slow when the number of
samples increases. Here, we propose a way to learn an approximate transport map
and a parametric approximation of the Wasserstein barycenter. We build an
approximated transport mapping by leveraging the closed-form of Gaussian
(Bures-Wasserstein) transport; we compute local transport plans between matched
pairs of the Gaussian components of each density. The learned map generalizes
to out-of-sample examples. We provide experimental results on simulated and
real data, comparing our proposed method with other mapping estimation
algorithms. Preliminary experiments suggest that our proposed method is not
only faster, with a factor 80 overall running time, but it also requires fewer
components than state-of-the-art methods to recover the support of the
barycenter. From a practical standpoint, it is straightforward to implement and
can be used with a conventional machine learning pipeline.

standardized evaluation techniques. To facilitate progress in this field, we
introduce the Tasks Assessing Protein Embeddings (TAPE), a set of five
biologically relevant semi-supervised learning tasks spread across different
domains of protein biology. We curate tasks into specific training, validation,
and test splits to ensure that each task tests biologically relevant
generalization that transfers to real-life scenarios. We benchmark a range of
approaches to semi-supervised protein representation learning, which span
recent work as well as canonical sequence learning techniques. We find that
self-supervised pretraining is helpful for almost all models on all tasks, more
than doubling performance in some cases. Despite this increase, in several
cases features learned by self-supervised pretraining still lag behind features
extracted by state-of-the-art non-neural techniques. This gap in performance
suggests a huge opportunity for innovative architecture design and improved
modeling paradigms that better capture the signal in biological sequences. TAPE
will help the machine learning community focus effort on scientifically
relevant problems. Toward this end, all data and code used to run these

this work we address the prospects of the LSST in discovering Tidal Disruption
Events (TDEs) and in probing the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass
distribution in the Universe. We used the LSST simulation framework and defined
TDE catalogs on 20 fields of 20.25 deg$^2$ size. TDE properties were defined by
randomly chosen impact factors and SMBH masses drawn from six different mass
distributions. Observations of TDEs in 10 years of LSST operations were
simulated by querying the simulated observing strategy database minion_1016.
Based on the results of our simulations we estimate that the LSST should
discover between 35 000 and 80 000 TDEs in 10 years of operations, depending on
the assumed SMBH mass distribution. We also find that probing the SMBH mass
distribution with TDE observations will not be straightforward due to the fact
that TDEs caused by low mass black holes ($10^ 5 M_\odot$) are expected to be
less luminous and shorter than TDEs by heavier SMBHs ($> 10^6 M_\odot$), and
therefore will mostly be missed by the irregular LSST cadence minion_1016.

The line was narrow (FWHM ~ 0.6 km/s) and ~40 km/s blueshifted with respect to
the systemic velocity, which suggests association with the expanding
jets/bullets in CRL 618. We also report non-detection at Arecibo of any other

analytically related yet. In this work we show that Divisive Normalization can
be obtained from the Wilson-Cowan model. Specifically, assuming that Divisive
Normalization is the steady state solution of the Wilson-Cowan differential
equation, we find that the kernel that controls neural interactions in Divisive
Normalization depends on the Wilson-Cowan kernel but also has a
signal-dependent contribution. A standard stability analysis of a Wilson-Cowan
model with the parameters obtained from our relation shows that the Divisive
Normalization solution is a stable node. This stability demonstrates the
consistency of our steady state assumption.
  The proposed theory provides a physiological foundation (a relation to a
dynamical network with fixed wiring among neurons) for the functional
suggestions that have been done on the need of signal-dependent Divisive
Normalization [e.g. in Coen-Cagli et al., PLoS Comp.Biol. 2012]. Moreover, this
theory explains the modifications that had to be introduced ad-hoc in Gaussian
kernels of Divisive Normalization in [Martinez et al. Front. Neurosci. 2019] to
reproduce contrast responses. The proposed relation implies that the
Wilson-Cowan dynamics also reproduces visual masking and subjective image
distortion metrics, which up to now had been mainly explained via Divisive
Normalization. Finally, this relation allows to apply to Divisive Normalization
the methods which up to now had been developed for dynamical systems such as

omni-directional total reflection, called anti-super Klein tunneling, is
observed if the junction is parallel to the armchair edge. Applying the
nonequilibrium Green's function method on the tight-binding model, we calculate

the atypical transport properties, which can be used in nano-devices to
collimate and filter the electron flow, or to switch its direction.

a continually reducing dark matter mass as the scalar field rolls in the recent

high precision astrometry of Proxima Centauri. This requires ${\approx 10}$
years of observations at an individual epoch precision of $0.5 \, \mu$as,

characteristic spectral features resulting from reprocessing of hard X-rays by
the accretion disc, such as an Fe K$\alpha$ line and a Compton hump. This
emission probes of the innermost region of the accretion disc through general
relativistic distortions to the line profile. However, these spectral
distortions are insensitive to black hole mass, since they depend on disc
geometry in units of gravitational radii. Measuring the reverberation lag
resulting from the difference in path length between direct and reflected
emission calibrates the absolute length of the gravitational radius. We use a
relativistic model able to reproduce the behaviour of the lags as a function of

reverberation lags on short timescales and the intrinsic hard lags on longer
timescales. We jointly fit the time-averaged spectrum and the real and

very high resolution (12~pc/h) cosmological hydrodynamic zoom simulation. To
realistically describe the formation and evolution of small-mass stellar
satellites, our model includes a full baryonic physics treatment including a
recipe for UV self-shielding. We find that the mini-halos form objects
resembling dwarf galaxies. Despite our high resolution, none of our
'mini-halos' form objects that might be considered globular cluster-like.
Instead such objects are formed in the host galaxy's gaseous disk. We
investigate why some form stars more efficiently than others. We find that the
majority of their star forming gas is accreted after reionisation, thus the
survival of a mini-halo's gas to reionisation is not an important factor.
Instead, the key factor seems to be the ability for a mini-halo to cool its
recently accreted gas, which is more efficient in more massive halos. We find
halos in denser environments suffer more mergers, enabling them to grow their
mass such that cooling of accreted gas can occur efficiently. Although the host
galaxy is only a dwarf galaxy itself, we find that ram pressure is an efficient
means by which accreted mini-halos lose their gas content, both by interacting
with hot halo gas but also in direct collisions with the gas disk of the host.
The satellites are also disrupted by the tidal forces near the center of the
host galaxy. Compared to the disrupted satellites, surviving satellites are
relatively more massive, but tend to infall later into the host galaxy, thus
reducing the time they are subjected to destructive environmental mechanisms
and dynamical friction. In summary, our results suggest that the
characteristics of satellites are mainly determined by their ability to
efficiently cool gas that is accreted in the redshift range z=3-5, prior to
their infall into the host galaxy.

that the globular cluster system of our Galaxy has followed a similarly
intricate formation path. $Aims$. To constrain this formation path, we explore
the link between the globular clusters and the known merging events that the
Milky Way has experienced. $Methods$. To this end, we combined the kinematic
information provided by $Gaia$ for almost all Galactic clusters, with the
largest sample of cluster ages available after carefully correcting for
systematic errors. To identify clusters with a common origin we analysed their
dynamical properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion.
$Results$. We find that about 40% of the clusters likely formed in situ. A
similarly large fraction, 35%, appear to be possibly associated to known merger
events, in particular to $Gaia$-Enceladus (19%), the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy
(5%), the progenitor of the Helmi streams (6%), and to the Sequoia galaxy (5%),
although some uncertainty remains due to the degree of overlap in their
dynamical characteristics. Of the remaining clusters, 16% are tentatively
associated to a group with high binding energy, while the rest are all on
loosely bound orbits and likely have a more heterogeneous origin. The resulting
age-metallicity relations are remarkably tight and differ in their detailed
properties depending on the progenitor, providing further confidence on the
associations made. $Conclusions$. We provide a table listing the likely
associations. Improved kinematic data by future Gaia data releases and

out the cosmological constant with decisive statistical significance and is a
strong alternative to explain combination of different cosmological

with an environment. For weakly-damped systems the Lindblad-form Markovian
master equation is invaluable for this task due to its tractability and
efficiency. This equation only applies, however, when the frequencies of any
subset of the system's transitions are either equal (degenerate), or their
differences are much greater than the transitions' linewidths (far-detuned).
Outside of these two regimes the only available efficient description has been
the Bloch-Redfield (B-R) master equation, the efficacy of which has long been
controversial due to its failure to guarantee the positivity of the density
matrix. The ability to efficiently simulate weakly-damped systems across all
regimes is becoming increasingly important, especially in the area of quantum
technologies. Here we solve this long-standing problem. We discover that a
condition on the slope of the spectral density is sufficient to derive a
Lindblad form master equation that is accurate for all regimes. We further show
that this condition is necessary for weakly-damped systems to be described by
the B-R equation or indeed any Markovian master equation. We thus obtain a
replacement for the B-R equation over its entire domain of applicability that
is no less accurate, simpler in structure, completely positive, allows
simulation by efficient quantum trajectory methods, and unifies the previous
Lindblad master equations. We also show via exact simulations that the new
master equation can describe systems in which slowly-varying transition
frequencies cross each other during the evolution. System identification tools,
developed in systems engineering, play an important role in our analysis. We
expect these tools to prove useful in other areas of physics involving complex

signature of $\mathcal{T-P}$ symmetry breaking considering superconductivity

both modulating charge and current densities. This framework takes into account
an intricate competition between the ubiquitous charge density wave and SC,

stabilized, provided the BDW itself breaks $\mathcal{T}-\mathcal{P}$. But this
ground state ceases to occur at higher temperatures. However, we show that

absorption lines of the elements under consideration. We used estimates of
temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity that we previously determined
from the same spectra. We estimated systematic error by examining the
dispersion of abundances within mono-metallic globular clusters. The median
uncertainties for [Cr/Fe], [Co/Fe], and [Ni/Fe] are 0.20, 0.20, and 0.13,
respectively. Finally, we validated our estimations of uncertainty through
duplicate measurements, and we evaluated the accuracy and precision of our
measurements through comparison to high-resolution spectroscopic measurements
of the same stars.

molecules causes a distortion of the potential energy hypersurfaces which
determine the motion of nuclei in a molecule and influences possible reaction
pathways. The coupling strength varies with the angle between the light
electric field and valence orbital, and thereby adds another dimension to the
effective molecular potential energy surface, allowing for the emergence of
light-induced conical intersections. Here, we demonstrate in theory and
experiment that the full complexity of such light-induced potential energy
surfaces can be uncovered. In H$_2^+$, the simplest of molecules, we observe a
strongly modulated angular distribution of protons which has escaped prior
observation. These modulations directly result from ultrafast dynamics on the
light-induced molecular potentials and can be modified by varying the
amplitude, duration and phase of the mid-infrared dressing field. This opens
new opportunities for manipulating the dissociation of small molecules using

centre of our galaxy. Building up such a massive black hole within the ~10^10
year lifetime of our galaxy would require a mean accretion rate of ~4x10^-4
Msun/yr. At present, X-ray observations constrain the rate of hot gas accretion
at the Bondi radius (10^5 R_Sch = 0.04 pc at 8kpc) to \dot{M}_Bondi ~ 3x10^-6
Msun/yr, and polarization measurements constrain it near the event horizon to
\dot{M}_horizon ~ 10^{-8} Msun/yr. A range of models was developed to describe
the accretion gas onto an underfed black hole. However, the exact physics still
remains to be understood. One challenge with the radiation inefficient
accretion flows is that even if one understands the dynamics there is no
accepted prescription for associating emissivity (and absorption) with the
flow. The other issue is the lack of model-independent probes of accretion flow
at intermediate radii (between few and ~ 10^5 R_Sch), i.e. the constraints that
do not assume a model of accretion flow as an input parameter. We report
detection and imaging of the 10^4 K ionized gas disk within 2x10^4 R_Sch in a
mm hydrogen recombination line H30alpha: n = 31 -> 30 at 231.9 GHz using the
ALMA. The emission was detected with a double-peaked line profile spanning full
width of 2,200 km/s with the approaching and the receding components straddling
Sgr A*, each offset from it by 0.11arcsec= 0.004pc. The red-shifted side is
displaced to the north-east, while the blue-shifted side is displaced to the
south-west. The limit on the total mass of ionized gas estimated from the
emission is 10^-4 - 10^-5 Sun at a mean hydrogen density 10^5-10^6 cm^-3,
depending upon whether or not we assume the presence of a uniform density disk
or an ensemble of orbiting clouds, and the amplification factor of the mm

Two-particle correlation functions are measured as a function of relative
azimuthal angle over the relative pseudorapidity range $2<|\Delta\eta|<5$ for
different intervals of charged-particle multiplicity and transverse momentum.
The measurements are corrected for the presence of background charged particles
generated by collisions that occur during one passage of two colliding proton

from hard processes are removed using a template-fitting procedure. Sinusoidal
modulation in the correlation functions is observed and quantified by the
second Fourier coefficient of the correlation function, $v_{2,2}$, which in
turn is used to obtain the single-particle anisotropy coefficient $v_{2}$. The
$v_{2}$ values in the $Z$-tagged events, integrated over $0.5<p_{\mathrm{T}}<5$

within uncertainties with previous measurements in inclusive $pp$ collisions.

implicitly assumed or described informally. This makes it difficult to
establish appropriate baselines for comparison in research papers, as well as
making it difficult for practitioners to find the papers relevant to their
concrete application. This paper aims to fill this gap and support researchers

  The deformation is a product of hermitian operators on the left and right
systems that are identical to each other and that lasts for a small amount of
time.
  We study the linear dependence on the quench to the properties of the
deformation under time reversal. If the quench is time symmetric, then the
linear response after the quench of all T-even operators vanishes. This
includes the response of the energy on the left system and all the
thermodynamic expectation values (the time averaged expectation values of the
operators). Also, we show under an assumption of non-degeneracy of the
Hamiltonian that the entanglement entropy between left and right is not
affected to this order. We also study a variation of the quench where an
instantaneous deformation is given by an operator of fixed T-parity and it's
time derivative. It is shown that the sign of the response of the Hamiltonian
is correlated with the T-parity of the operator. We can then choose the sign of
the amplitude of the quench to result in a reduction in the energy. This
implies a reduction of the entanglement entropy between both sides.

dense medium, whose evolution can be calculated by a hydrocode. On the other
hand, the orbital evolution of satellites is generally performed using N-body
integrators. We have developed a new numerical model that combines a
1-dimensional hydrocode with the N-body integrator SyMBA. The disk evolves due
to its viscosity, and resonant torques from satellites. The latter is applied
to the satellites as an additional ""kick"" to their accelerations. The
integrator also includes the ability to spawn new moonlets at the disk's outer
edge if the latter expands beyond a material-dependent Roche limit, as well as
the effects of tidal dissipation in the planet and/or the satellite on the
satellite orbits. The resulting integrator allows one to accurately model the
evolution of an inner circumplanetary disk, and the formation of satellites by
accumulation of disk material, all within a single self-consistent framework.
Potential applications include the formation of Earth's Moon, the evolution of
the inner Saturn system, the martian and uranian moons, and compact
exoplanetary systems.

the random walk in this landscape under various effective temperature $\mu$,
which continuously modulates the dynamic heterogeneity. We show in the long
time limit, the trap dynamics on the landscape is equivalent to the quenched
trap model, in which sub-diffusion appears for $\mu<1$. The non-Gaussian
distribution of displacement has been analytically estimated for short $t$, of
which the stretched exponential tail is expected for $\mu\neq1$. Due to the
localization in the ensemble of trajectory segments, an additional peak arises
in $P(x,t)$ around $x=0$ even for $\mu>1$. Evolving in different time scales,
the peak and the tail of $P(x,t)$ are well split for a wide range of $t$. This
theoretical study reveals the connections among the sub-diffusion, non-Gaussian

  cyclones over South-West Indian ocean, using the UEMS-WRF regional climate
  model","22 pages, 18 Figures",,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Tropical cyclones remain a major threat to the lives, property and economy of
communities around the South West Indian ocean (SWIO), notably Southern Africa
and Madagascar. This study uses the weather research forecast (WRF) model to
perform a series of simulations for tropical cyclone Enawo with the aim of
investigating the effect of an increase or decrease (by 2$^{\circ}C$) in sea
surface temperature (SST) on the intensity of the tropical cyclone (using
windspeed, precipitation and pressure as measures of cyclone intensity). The
experiment uses the data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 re-analysis dataset to validate the results of the WRF
model which was ran using boundary conditions data from climate forecast system
reanalysis (CFSR).
  The results indicate that the WRF model performs reasonably well in
simulating the track and windspeed of the tropical cyclone, when compared to
observational data. In simulating the tropical cyclone, the WRF model shows
that an increase in the SST by 2$^{\circ}C$ generally increases the intensity
of the tropical cyclone formed. This is evident in the increasing maximum
precipitation rate as well as windspeed, and decreasing minimum pressure. An
increase in SST also causes the emergence of a second low pressure system. On
the other hand, a decrease in the SST by 2$^{\circ}C$ leads to a minute effect
in the intensity but generally acts to decrease it. This results in a smoother
track path for the tropical cyclone, a decrease in the maximum precipitation
rate and windspeed, and an increase in the surface pressure.
  The results of this study have shown that increasing the global temperature
by around 2$^{\circ}C$ - violation of the Paris Accord - would lead to more
violent and unpredictable tropical cyclones within the SWIO, and hence more
destruction and loss of lives.

through particle layers at 10\% volume fraction, using ensemble-averaged
results from particle-resolved large eddy simulations. The advantage of using
large eddy simulations to study this problem is that they capture the strong
velocity shears and flow separation caused by the no-slip condition at the
particle surfaces. The shock particle cloud interaction produces a reflected
shock wave, whose strength increases with decreasing particle Reynolds number.
This results in important changes to the flow field that enters the particle
cloud. The results show an approximate proportionality between the mean flow
velocity and the flow fluctuation magnitudes. Maximum particle drag forces are
in excellent agreement with previous inviscid studies, and we complement these
results with statistics of time-averaged particle forces as well as the
variation of temporal oscillations. The results of this work provides a basis
for development of improved simplified dispersed flow models.

high-fidelity quantum computing. However, their performance is limited by
charge noise, which is ubiquitous in solid-state devices, and phonon-induced
dephasing. Here we explore methods for improving the quantum operations of a
hybrid qubit, using strong microwave driving to enable gate operations that are
much faster than decoherence processes. Using numerical simulations and a
theoretical method based on a cumulant expansion, we analyze qubit dynamics in
the presence of $1/f$ charge noise, which forms the dominant decoherence
mechanism in many solid-state devices. We show that, while strong-driving
effects and charge noise both reduce the quantum gate fidelity, simple
pulse-shaping techniques effectively suppress the strong-driving effects.
Moreover, a broad AC sweet spot emerges when the detuning parameter and the
tunneling coupling are driven simultaneously. Taking into account
phonon-mediated noise, we find that it should be possible to achieve $X_{\pi}$
gates with fidelities higher than $99.9\%$.

accuracy, inference latency, and computational cost. Traditionally, researchers
manually craft deep neural networks to meet the needs of mobile devices. Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) was proposed to automate the neural architecture
design without requiring extensive domain expertise and significant manual
efforts. Recent works utilized NAS to design mobile models by taking into
account hardware constraints and achieved state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer
parameters and less computational cost measured in Multiply-accumulates (MACs).
To find highly compact neural architectures, existing works relies on
predefined cells and directly applying width multiplier, which may potentially
limit the model flexibility, reduce the useful feature map information, and
cause accuracy drop. To conquer this issue, we propose GRAM(GRAph propagation
as Meta-knowledge) that adopts fine-grained (node-wise) search method and
accumulates the knowledge learned in updates into a meta-graph. As a result,
GRAM can enable more flexible search space and achieve higher search
efficiency. Without the constraints of predefined cell or blocks, we propose a
new structure-level pruning method to remove redundant operations in neural
architectures. SwiftNet, which is a set of models discovered by GRAM,
outperforms MobileNet-V2 by 2.15x higher accuracy density and 2.42x faster with
similar accuracy. Compared with FBNet, SwiftNet reduces the search cost by 26x
and achieves 2.35x higher accuracy density and 1.47x speedup while preserving
similar accuracy. SwiftNetcan obtain 63.28% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with
only 53M MACs and 2.07M parameters. The corresponding inference latency is only

cast.
  We introduce a model for, and initiate the study of, bribery in such an
online, sequential setting. We show that even for election systems whose
winner-determination problem is polynomial-time computable, an online,
sequential setting may vastly increase the complexity of bribery, jumping the
problem up to completeness for high levels of the polynomial hierarchy or even
PSPACE. But we also show that for some natural, important election systems,
such a dramatic complexity increase does not occur, and we pinpoint the
complexity of their bribery problems.

average of the random process satisfies the deterministic picture accepted in
the physical literature. Assuming that the number of quanta is finite the
proposed Markov process consists of two components: the number of the quanta in
the black hole and the amount of the quanta outside.
  The stochastic representation allows us to apply large deviation theory to
study the asymptotics of probabilities of rare events when the number of quanta
grows to infinity. The theory provides explicitly the rate functional for the
process. Its infimum over the set of all trajectories leading to a large
emission event is attained on the most probable trajectory. This trajectory is
a solution of a highly nonlinear Hamiltonian system of equations. Under the
condition of the stationarity of the fraction of quanta in the black hole, we
found the most probable trajectory corresponding to a large emission event.

frequencies, as well as to the time-averaged spectrum. This not only enables
better geometric constraints than only modelling the relativistically broadened
reflection features in the time-averaged spectrum, but additionally enables
constraints on the mass of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei
and stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries. We include a self-consistently
calculated radial profile of the disk ionization parameter and properly account
for the effect that the telescope response has on the predicted time lags. We
find that a number of previous spectral analyses have measured artificially low
source heights due to not accounting for the former effect and that timing
analyses have been affected by the latter. In particular, the magnitude of the
soft lags in active galactic nuclei may have been under-estimated, and the
magnitude of lags attributed to thermal reverberation in X-ray binaries may
have been over-estimated. We fit \textsc{reltrans} to the lag-energy spectrum

FSRQ PKS 0346-27 (z=0.991), as revealed by Fermi-LAT monitoring data, and the
concurrent multi-wavelength variability observed from radio through X-rays. The
quasi-simultaneous multi-wavelength coverage allowed us to construct
time-resolved spectral energy distributions (SEDs). PKS 0346-27 entered an
elevated $\gamma$-ray activity state starting from the beginning of 2018. The
high-state continued throughout the year, displaying the highest fluxes in May
2018. We find evidence of short-time scale variability down to $\sim$1.5 hours,
which constrains the $\gamma$-ray emission region to be compact. The extended
flaring period was characterized by a persistently harder spectrum with respect
to the quiescent state, indicating changes in the broadband spectral properties
of the source. This was confirmed by the multi-wavelength observations, which
show a shift in the position of the two SED peaks by $\sim$2 orders of
magnitude in energy and peak flux value. As a result, during the high state the
non-thermal jet emission completely outshines the thermal contribution from the
dust torus and accretion disk. The broadband SED of PKS 0346-27 transitions
from a typical Low-Synchrotron-Peaked (LSP) to the
Intermediate-Synchrotron-Peaked (ISP) class, a behavior previously observed in
other flaring $\gamma$-ray sources. Our one-zone leptonic emission model of the
high-state SEDs constrains the $\gamma$-ray emission region to have a lower
magnetic field, larger radius, and higher maximum electron Lorentz factors with
respect to the quiescent SED. Finally, we note that the bright and hard
$\gamma$-ray spectrum observed during the peak of flaring activity in May 2018
implies that PKS 0346-27 could be a promising target for future ground-based
Cherenkov observatories such as the CTA.

observing all communication to and from the server cannot learn any private

given protocols for secure aggregation that achieve differential privacy

Either the expected aggregation error or the amount of communication per user
scales as a polynomial $n^{\Omega(1)}$ in the number of users $n$. In this
paper we propose simple and more efficient protocol for aggregation in the

presence of a reflecting boundary, an interacting test particle undergoes
velocity fluctuations. Such effect is regarded as a sort of quantum analog of
the classical Brownian motion. Several aspects about this system have been
recently investigated in the literature, for instance, finite temperature
effects, curved spacetime framework, near-boundary regime, late time behavior,
and subvacuum phenomena. Here, further steps are given in this analysis by
considering the effect of vacuum fluctuations of a scalar field in the presence
of a perfectly reflecting flat boundary over the motion of a scalar test
particle when the background field does not satisfy the Huygens' principle.
Specifically, the background field is allowed to have mass and the system is
studied in $D+1$ dimensions. A method of implementing a smooth transition
between distinct states of the field is also developed, rendering regularized
analytic expressions describing the velocity fluctuations of the test particle.
This method is applied to study some special behaviors of the system. Possible
applications include fields known to occur in nature as, for instance, the
massive Higgs' field, for which the velocity fluctuations are here predicted to
acquire a characteristic oscillation, thus behaving differently from their
electromagnetic counterparts.

enable channel estimation at the FC, CHs send pilots, prior to data
transmission. We derive the mean square error (MSE) corresponding to the linear
minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator of the source at the FC, and derive
the Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). Our goal is to find (i) the optimal

transmit their amplified measurements to their CH, and (iii) the optimal weight
vector employed by each CH for its linear signal fusion, such that the MSE is
minimized, subject to a network power constraint. To untangle the performance
gain that optimizing each set of these variables provide, we also analyze three
special cases of the original problem, where in each special case, only two
sets of variables are optimized across clusters. We define three factors that
allow us to quantify the effectiveness of each power allocation scheme in
achieving an MSE-power tradeoff that is close to that of the Bayesian CRB.
Combining the information gained from the factors and Bayesian CRB with our

quantitative complexity-versus-MSE improvement tradeoffs offered by different

trivial to use CNN-based methods for saliency detection on light field images
because these methods are not specifically designed for processing light field

importance due to today's large real-world networks. In such algorithms, a node
is allowed only to have local interactions with its immediate neighbors. This
is because the whole network topological structure is often unknown to each
node. Recently, distributed detection of central nodes, concerning different
notions of importance, within a network has received much attention. Closeness
centrality is a prominent measure to evaluate the importance (influence) of
nodes, based on their accessibility, in a given network. In this paper, first,
we introduce a local (ego-centric) metric that correlates well with the global
closeness centrality; however, it has very low computational complexity.
Second, we propose a compressive sensing (CS)-based framework to accurately
recover high closeness centrality nodes in the network utilizing the proposed
local metric. Both ego-centric metric computation and its aggregation via CS
are efficient and distributed, using only local interactions between
neighboring nodes. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method
through extensive experiments on various synthetic and real-world networks. The
results show that the proposed local metric correlates with the global
closeness centrality, better than the current local metrics. Moreover, the
results demonstrate that the proposed CS-based method outperforms the

current models based on single ionization-rate equations do not account for the
gradual heating of the charge carriers which, for short laser pulses, might not
be sufficient to start an avalanche. On the other hand, models based on
multiple rate equations that track the carriers kinetics rely on several free
parameters, which limits the physical insight that we can gain from them. In
this paper, we develop a model that overcomes these issues by tracking both the
plasma density and carriers' mean kinetic energy as a function of time, forming
a set of delayed rate equations that we use to match the laser-induced damage
threshold of several dielectric materials. In particular, we show that this
simplified model reproduces the predictions from the multiple rate equations,

investigated. The grains exhibit self-organized domain structure in these

higher electrical conductivity in comparison to ""inter-cluster"" grain

such, polarization-dependent conductivity of the grain boundaries was observed
for the first time in ferroelectric thin films. The results are rationalized by
thermodynamic modelling combined with finite element simulations of the charge

conductivity. The observed polarization-dependent conductivity of grain

We analyzed Fermi-LAT data in order to study possible connections between the

galaxies, both in terms of variability and average properties. We discuss the
individual source results and draw preliminary conclusions on sample properties
including published VLBI results from the MOJAVE survey, with a total of
fifteen sources. We find that the first $\gamma$-ray detection of Pictor A
might be associated with the passage of a new VLBI component through the radio
core. For the peculiar AGN PKS 0521-36, we detect subluminal parsec-scale jet
motions, and we confirm the presence of fast $\gamma$-ray variability in the
source down to timescales of 6 hours. We robustly confirm the presence of
significant superluminal motion, up to $\beta_{app}\sim$3, in the jet of the
TeV radio galaxy PKS 0625-35. Finally, we place a lower limit on the age of the
Compact Symmetric Object (CSO) PKS 1718-649. We draw some preliminary
conclusions on the relationship between pc-scale jets and $\gamma$-ray emission
in radio galaxies. We find that the VLBI core flux density correlates with the
$\gamma$-ray flux, as seen in blazars. On the other hand, the $\gamma$-ray
luminosity does not show any dependence on the core brightness temperature and
core dominance, two indicators of Doppler boosting, suggesting that
$\gamma$-ray emission in radio galaxies is not driven by orientation-dependent

"1906.08345","Guillaume Bal","Guillaume Bal","Topological invariants for interface modes","39 pages, rewritten sections on bulk-difference invariants and the
  bulk-interface correspondence",,,,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider topologically non-trivial interface Hamiltonians, which find
several applications in materials science and geophysical fluid flows. The
non-trivial topology manifests itself in the existence of topologically
protected, asymmetric edge states at the interface between two two-dimensional
half spaces in different topological phases. It is characterized by a quantized
interface conductivity. The objective of this paper is to compute such a
conductivity and show its stability under perturbations. We present two
methods.
  The first one computes the conductivity using the winding number of branches
of absolutely continuous spectrum of the interface Hamiltonian. This
calculation is independent of any bulk properties but requires a sufficient
understanding of the spectral decomposition of the Hamiltonian. In the fluid
flow setting, it also applies in cases where the so-called bulk-interface
correspondence fails.
  The second method establishes a bulk-interface correspondence between the
interface conductivity and a so-called bulk-difference invariant. We introduce
the bulk-difference invariants characterizing pairs of half spaces. We then
relate the interface conductivity to the bulk-difference invariant by means of
a Fedosov-H\""ormander formula, which computes the index of a related Fredholm
operator.
  The two methods are used to compute invariants for representative $2\times2$
and $3\times3$ systems of equations that appear in the applications.

involve, amongst others, the binomial transform, truncated multiple zeta and
multiple zeta star values, as well as special functions. As an application we
discuss the limit law of the number of comparisons of the Quicksort algorithm:
we reprove that the moments of the limit law are rational polynomials in the

  Astrophysics","11 pages",,"10.1088/1538-3873/ab2743",,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Astronomical observations already produce vast amounts of data through a new
generation of telescopes that cannot be analyzed manually. Next-generation
telescopes such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the Square Kilometer
Array are planned to become operational in this decade and the next, and will
increase the data volume by many orders of magnitude. The increased spatial,
temporal and spectral resolution afford a powerful magnifying lens on the
physical processes that underlie the data but, at the same time, generate
unprecedented complexity hard to exploit for knowledge extraction. It is
therefore imperative to develop machine intelligence, machine learning (ML) in
particular, suitable for processing the amount and variety of astronomical data
that will be collected, and capable of answering scientific questions based on
the data. Astronomical data exhibit the usual challenges associated with 'big
data' such as immense volumes, high dimensionality, missing or highly distorted
observations. In addition, astronomical data can exhibit large continuous
observational gaps, very low signal-to-noise ratio and the need to distinguish
between true missing data and non-detections due to upper limits). There are
strict laws of physics behind the data production which can be assimilated into
ML mechanisms to improve over general off-the-shelf state-of-the-art methods.
Significant progress in the face of these challenges can be achieved only via
the new discipline of Astroinformatics: a symbiosis of diverse disciplines,
such as ML, probabilistic modeling, astronomy and astrophysics, statistics,
distributed computing and natural computation. This editorial summarizes the
contents of a soon to appear Focus Issue of the PASP on Machine Learning in
Astronomy and Astrophysics (with contributions by 69 authors representing 15
countries, from 6 continents).

in agreement with previous measurements; however, the $\Xi_c^0$ baryon lifetime
is approximately 3.3 standard deviations larger than the world average value.

systems developed by Lakos. The Lakosian approach is one of the few design
methodologies to address physical design rather than just logical design. Using
the MLSA toolkit developed in prior work for analysis of multilingual software,
we focus in on one FFI -- the pybind11 FFI. An extension to the Lakosian C++
design rules is proposed to address multilingual software that uses pybind11.
Using a sample of 50 public GitHub repositories that use pybind11, we measure
how many repositories would currently satisfy these rules. We conclude with a
proposed generalization of the pybind11-based rules for any multilingual
software using an FFI interface.

have been developed by surface passivation and encapsulation with atomic layers
of MgO using materials by design; the physical properties investigated. The
passivation and encapsulation led to a remarkable improvement in optical and
electronic properties. The valence-band offset $\Delta E_v$ between MgO and
ZnO, ZnO and MgO/ZnO, and ZnO and MgO/ZnO/MgO heterointerfaces are determined
to be 0.37 $\pm$0.02, -0.05$\pm$0.02, and -0.11$\pm$0.02 eV, respectively; the
conduction-band offset $\Delta E_c$ is deduced to be 0.97$\pm$0.02,
0.46$\pm$0.02, and 0.59$\pm$0.02 eV indicating straddling type-I in MgO and
ZnO, and staggering type-II heterojunction band alignment in ZnO and the
various heterostructures. The band-offsets and interfacial charge transfer are
used to explain the origin of $n$-type conductivity in the superlattices.
Enhanced optical absorption due to carrier confinement in the layers
demonstrates that MgO is an excellent high-$\kappa$ dielectric gate oxide for
encapsulating ZnO-based optoelectronic devices.

platform for quantum sensing applications. Sensitivity of the applications
using NV centers in NDs is often limited due to presence of paramagnetic
impurity contents near the ND surface. Here, we investigate near-surface
paramagnetic impurities in NDs. Using high-frequency (HF) electron paramagnetic
resonance spectroscopy, the near-surface paramagnetic impurity within the shell
of NDs is probed and its g-value is determined to be 2.0028(3). Furthermore, HF
electron-electron double resonance-detected nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy and a first principle calculation show that a possible structure
of the near-surface impurity is the negatively charged vacancy V-. The
identification of the near-surface impurity by the present investigation
provides a promising pathway to improve the NV properties in NDs and the

C 79 (2019) 706","10.1140/epjc/s10052-019-7159-8","LHCb-PAPER-2019-013; CERN-EP-2019-108","hep-ex","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The decay-time-dependent $CP$ asymmetry in $B^{0}_{s}\to J/\psi K^{+} K^{-}$
decays is measured using proton-proton collision data, corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of $1.9\,\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$, collected with the LHCb
detector at a centre-of-mass energy of $13\,\mathrm{TeV}$ in 2015 and 2016.
Using a sample of approximately 117\,000 signal decays with an invariant $K^{+}
K^{-}$ mass in the vicinity of the $\phi(1020)$ resonance, the $CP$-violating
phase $\phi_s$ is measured, along with the difference in decay widths of the
light and heavy mass eigenstates of the $B^{0}_{s}$-$\bar{B}^{0}_{s}$ system,
$\Delta\Gamma_s$. The difference of the average $B^{0}_{s}$ and $B^{0}$ meson
decay widths, $\Gamma_s-\Gamma_d$, is determined using in addition a sample of
$B^{0} \to J/\psi K^{+} \pi^{-}$ decays. The values obtained are $\phi_s =
-0.083\pm0.041\pm0.006\,\mathrm{rad}$, $\Delta\Gamma_s = 0.077 \pm 0.008 \pm
0.003\, \mathrm{ps^{-1}}$ and $\Gamma_s-\Gamma_d = -0.0041 \pm 0.0024 \pm
0.0015\,\mathrm{ps^{-1}}$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the
second systematic. These are the most precise single measurements of these
quantities to date and are consistent with expectations based on the Standard
Model and with a previous LHCb analysis of this decay using data recorded at

help the understandability of global post-hoc explanations, presented in the

explains artificial neural networks by means of decision trees, and we extend
it to include ontologies modeling domain knowledge in the process of generating
explanations. We present the results of a user study that measures the

coverage back to 2005, but we extend the observational baseline for AR Sco back
to the beginning of the 20th century by analyzing observations from the Digital
Access to a Sky Century at Harvard project (DASCH). We find that the orbital
waveform of AR Sco remained constant across that baseline with no significant
deviations from its average brightness. This result strongly suggests that the
absence of accretion in modern observations is a long-term feature of AR Sco.
Additionally, the DASCH light curve provides an opportunity to test an earlier
prediction that an obliquity of the WD would result in a precessional period
observable in long-term studies of the orbital light curve. The DASCH
observations do not indicate the presence of such a period, and we show that
previous, inconclusive tests of this hypothesis were insensitive to the
existence of a precessional period. Furthermore, the long DASCH baseline
enables us to constrain the rate of change of the orbital frequency to
$\dot{\nu} \lesssim 3.8\times10^{-20}$ Hz s$^{-1}$, constraining the efficacy
of magnetic braking as a mechanism of angular-momentum loss in this system.
Finally, we discuss how the combination of the orbital waveform's stability,
high amplitude, and short period should make it possible to identify additional
WD pulsars in all-sky survey data.

novel method for the extraction of hierarchical connectivity components in the
human brain using resting-state fMRI. The method builds upon prior work of
Sparse Connectivity Patterns (SCPs) by introducing a hierarchy of sparse
overlapping patterns. The components are estimated by deep factorization of
correlation matrices generated from fMRI. The goal of the paper is to extract
interpretable hierarchical patterns using correlation matrices where a low rank
decomposition is formed by a linear combination of a high rank decomposition.
We formulate the decomposition as a non-convex optimization problem and solve
it using gradient descent algorithms with adaptive step size. We also provide a
method for the warm start of the gradient descent using singular value
decomposition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method on two
different real-world datasets by showing that multi-scale hierarchical SCPs are
reproducible between sub-samples and are more reproducible as compared to
single scale patterns. We also compare our method with existing hierarchical
community detection approaches. Our method also provides novel insight into the

edge-preserving mapping from the vertex set of $G$ to the vertex set of $H$.
For a fixed graph $H$, by \textsc{Hom($H$)} we denote the computational problem
which asks whether a given graph $G$ admits a homomorphism to $H$. If $H$ is a
complete graph with $k$ vertices, then \textsc{Hom($H$)} is equivalent to the
$k$-\textsc{Coloring} problem, so graph homomorphisms can be seen as
generalizations of colorings. It is known that \textsc{Hom($H$)} is
polynomial-time solvable if $H$ is bipartite or has a vertex with a loop, and
NP-complete otherwise [Hell and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, JCTB 1990]. In this paper we
are interested in the complexity of the problem, parameterized by the treewidth
of the input graph $G$. If $G$ has $n$ vertices and is given along with its
tree decomposition of width $\mathrm{tw}(G)$, then the problem can be solved in
time $|V(H)|^{\mathrm{tw}(G)} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, using a
straightforward dynamic programming. We explore whether this bound can be
improved. We show that if $H$ is a \emph{projective core}, then the existence
of such a faster algorithm is unlikely: assuming the Strong Exponential Time
Hypothesis (SETH), the \textsc{Hom($H$)} problem cannot be solved in time
$(|V(H)|-\epsilon)^{\mathrm{tw}(G)} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, for any
$\epsilon > 0$. This result provides a full complexity characterization for a
large class of graphs $H$, as almost all graphs are projective cores. We also
notice that the naive algorithm can be improved for some graphs $H$, and show a
complexity classification for all graphs $H$, assuming two conjectures from
algebraic graph theory. In particular, there are no known graphs $H$ which are
not covered by our result. In order to prove our results, we bring together
some tools and techniques from algebra and from fine-grained complexity.

  Embeddings",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Word embedding spaces are powerful tools for capturing latent semantic
relationships between terms in corpora, and have become widely popular for
building state-of-the-art natural language processing algorithms. However,
studies have shown that societal biases present in text corpora may be
incorporated into the word embedding spaces learned from them. Thus, there is
an ethical concern that human-like biases contained in the corpora and their
derived embedding spaces might be propagated, or even amplified with the usage
of the biased embedding spaces in downstream applications. In an attempt to
quantify these biases so that they may be better understood and studied,
several bias metrics have been proposed. We explore the statistical properties
of these proposed measures in the context of their cited applications as well
as their supposed utilities. We find that there are caveats to the simple
interpretation of these metrics as proposed. We find that the bias metric
proposed by Bolukbasi et al. 2016 is highly sensitive to embedding
hyper-parameter selection, and that in many cases, the variance due to the
selection of some hyper-parameters is greater than the variance in the metric
due to corpus selection, while in fewer cases the bias rankings of corpora vary
with hyper-parameter selection. In light of these observations, it may be the
case that bias estimates should not be thought to directly measure the
properties of the underlying corpus, but rather the properties of the specific
embedding spaces in question, particularly in the context of hyper-parameter
selections used to generate them. Hence, bias metrics of spaces generated with
differing hyper-parameters should be compared only with explicit consideration
of the embedding-learning algorithms particular configurations.

methodology in many applications such as video games, autonomous driving, and

global convergence of PG methods is lacking in the literature. In this work, we
close the gap by viewing PG methods from a nonconvex optimization perspective.
In particular, we propose a new variant of PG methods for infinite-horizon
problems that uses a random rollout horizon for the Monte-Carlo estimation of
the policy gradient. This method then yields an unbiased estimate of the policy
gradient with bounded variance, which enables the tools from nonconvex
optimization to be applied to establish global convergence. Employing this
perspective, we first recover the convergence results with rates to the
stationary-point policies in the literature. More interestingly, motivated by
advances in nonconvex optimization, we modify the proposed PG method by
introducing periodically enlarged stepsizes. The modified algorithm is shown to
escape saddle points under mild assumptions on the reward and the policy
parameterization. Under a further strict saddle points assumption, this result
establishes convergence to essentially locally-optimal policies of the
underlying problem, and thus bridges the gap in existing literature on the
convergence of PG methods. Results from experiments on the inverted pendulum
are then provided to corroborate our theory, namely, by slightly reshaping the
reward function to satisfy our assumption, unfavorable saddle points can be
avoided and better limit points can be attained. Intriguingly, this empirical
finding justifies the benefit of reward-reshaping from a nonconvex optimization
perspective.

often regulated to be fair, in the sense that the predicted target should
satisfy some quantitative notion of parity with respect to a protected
attribute. However, the exact tradeoff between fairness and accuracy is not
entirely clear, even for the basic paradigm of classification problems. In this
paper, we characterize an inherent tradeoff between statistical parity and
accuracy in the classification setting by providing a lower bound on the sum of
group-wise errors of any fair classifiers. Our impossibility theorem could be
interpreted as a certain uncertainty principle in fairness: if the base rates
differ among groups, then any fair classifier satisfying statistical parity has
to incur a large error on at least one of the groups. We further extend this
result to give a lower bound on the joint error of any (approximately) fair
classifiers, from the perspective of learning fair representations. To show
that our lower bound is tight, assuming oracle access to Bayes (potentially
unfair) classifiers, we also construct an algorithm that returns a randomized
classifier that is both optimal (in terms of accuracy) and fair. Interestingly,
when the protected attribute can take more than two values, an extension of
this lower bound does not admit an analytic solution. Nevertheless, in this
case, we show that the lower bound can be efficiently computed by solving a
linear program, which we term as the TV-Barycenter problem, a barycenter
problem under the TV-distance. On the upside, we prove that if the group-wise
Bayes optimal classifiers are close, then learning fair representations leads
to an alternative notion of fairness, known as the accuracy parity, which
states that the error rates are close between groups. Finally, we also conduct
experiments on real-world datasets to confirm our theoretical findings.

Contemporary off-policy algorithms either replay past experiences uniformly or

we consider learning a replay policy to optimize the cumulative reward. Replay
learning is challenging because the replay memory is noisy and large, and the
cumulative reward is unstable. To address these issues, we propose a novel
experience replay optimization (ERO) framework which alternately updates two
policies: the agent policy, and the replay policy. The agent is updated to
maximize the cumulative reward based on the replayed data, while the replay
policy is updated to provide the agent with the most useful experiences. The
conducted experiments on various continuous control tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of ERO, empirically showing promise in experience replay learning

fundamental importance in various fields. The known nonlocal games or
equivalent linear Bell inequalities are only useful for Bell networks of single
entanglement. Our goal in this paper is to propose a unified method for
constructing cooperating games in network scenarios. We first propose an
efficient method to construct numerous multipartite games from any graphs. The
main idea is the graph representation of entanglement-based quantum networks.
We further specify these graphic games with quantum advantages by providing a
simple sufficient and necessary condition. The graphic games imply the first
linear testing of the nonlocality of general quantum networks consisting of EPR
states. It also allows generating new instances going beyond well-known CHSH
games. Our result has interesting applications in quantum networks, Bell
theory, computational complexity, and theoretical computer science.

set of measurement vectors $\mathcal{X}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, a set of items
$\mathcal{Z}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, a fixed confidence $\delta$, and an unknown
vector $\theta^{\ast}\in \mathbb{R}^d$, the goal is to infer
$\text{argmax}_{z\in \mathcal{Z}} z^\top\theta^\ast$ with probability
$1-\delta$ by making as few sequentially chosen noisy measurements of the form
$x^\top\theta^{\ast}$ as possible. When $\mathcal{X}=\mathcal{Z}$, this setting
generalizes linear bandits, and when $\mathcal{X}$ is the standard basis
vectors and $\mathcal{Z}\subset \{0,1\}^d$, combinatorial bandits. Such a
transductive setting naturally arises when the set of measurement vectors is
limited due to factors such as availability or cost. As an example, in drug
discovery the compounds and dosages $\mathcal{X}$ a practitioner may be willing
to evaluate in the lab in vitro due to cost or safety reasons may differ vastly
from those compounds and dosages $\mathcal{Z}$ that can be safely administered
to patients in vivo. Alternatively, in recommender systems for books, the set
of books $\mathcal{X}$ a user is queried about may be restricted to well known
best-sellers even though the goal might be to recommend more esoteric titles
$\mathcal{Z}$. In this paper, we provide instance-dependent lower bounds for
the transductive setting, an algorithm that matches these up to logarithmic
factors, and an evaluation. In particular, we provide the first non-asymptotic
algorithm for linear bandits that nearly achieves the information theoretic
lower bound.

However, the principled design of specific movements is made difficult by the
number and nonlinearity of interactions. Here, we model mechanical systems as
linkages of rigid bonds (edges) connected by joints (nodes), and formulate a
simple but powerful framework for designing full nonlinear coordinated motions
using concepts from dynamical systems theory. We begin with principles for
designing finite and infinitesimal motions in small modules, and show that each
module is a one-dimensional map between distances across pairs of nodes. Next,
we represent the act of combining modules as an iteration of this map, and
design networks whose geometries reflect the map's fixed points, limit cycles,
and chaos. We use this representation to design different folding sequences
from a deployable network and a soliton, to a branched network acting as a
mechanical AND gate. Finally, we design large changes in curvature of the
entire network, and construct physical networks from laser-cut acrylic,
origami, and 3D printed material to demonstrate the framework's potential and
versatility for designing the full conformational trajectory of morphing

consideration of BESS life loss for different BESS application scenarios is
economic imperative. In this paper, a novel linear BESS life loss calculation
model for BESS-integrated wind farm in scheduled power tracking is proposed.
Firstly, based on the life cycle times-depth of discharge (DOD) relation-curve,
the BESS life loss coefficient for unit throughput energy with different state
of charge (SOC) can be determined from the life cycle times-DOD relation-curve
fitting function directly. Secondly, as unidirectional variation of SOC in a
single time step, the BESS life loss can be calculated through integration of
the life loss coefficient-SOC relation function. A linear BESS life loss
calculation model is established through self-optimal piecewise linearization
of the primitive function of the life loss coefficient-SOC relation function.
Thirdly, the proposed life loss calculation model is incorporated in the
BESS-integrated wind farm scheduled power tracking optimization. Case studies
demonstrate that with the proposed method, the BESS life loss item can be
incorporated in the optimization model effectively, and the scheduled power
tracking cost of the BESS-integrated wind farm can be determined and optimized

astronomy and cosmology. In the era of precision cosmology, we urgently need
better measurements of cosmological distances to observationally test the
increasing $H_{0}$ tension of the Hubble constant measured from different
tools. Using spectroastrometry, GRAVITY at The Very Large Telescope
Interferometer successfully revealed the structure, kinematics and angular
sizes of the broad-line region (BLR) of 3C 273 with an unprecedentedly high
spatial resolution. Fortunately, reverberation mapping (RM) of active galactic
nuclei (AGNs) reliably provides linear sizes of their BLRs. Here we report a
joint analysis of spectroastrometry and RM observations to measure AGN
distances. We apply this analysis to 3C 273 observed by both GRAVITY and an RM
campaign,and find an angular distance of $551.5_{-78.7}^{+97.3}\, {\rm Mpc}$
and $H_{0}=71.5_{-10.6}^{+11.9}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. Advantages of the
analysis are 1) its pure geometrical measurements and 2) it simultaneously
yields mass of the central black hole in the BLR. Moreover, we can conveniently
repeat measurements of selected AGNs to efficiently reduce the statistical and
systematic errors. Future observations of a reasonably sized sample ($\sim 30$
AGNs) will provide distances of the AGNs and hence a new way of measuring
$H_{0}$ with a high precision $\left(\lesssim 3\%\right)$ to test the $H_{0}$
tension.

more extensive networks of gas-sensitive semiconductor-based (GSS) sensors
deployed at neighbourhood scales in Los Angeles: one of ~20 and one of ~45 GSS
ozone sensors. Of these, ten sensors were co-located with different regulatory
measurement stations, allowing a rigorous test of the accuracy of the
algorithms used for off-site calibration and adjustment of low cost sensors.
The method is based on adjusting the gain and offset of the low-cost sensor to
match the first two moments of the probability distribution of the sensor
result to that of a proxy: a calibrated independent measurement (usually
derived from regulatory monitors) whose probability distribution evaluated over
a time that emphasizes diurnal variations is similar to that at the test
location. The regulatory measurement station physically closest to the low-cost
sensor was a good proxy for most sites. The algorithms developed were
successful in detecting and correcting sensor drift, and in identifying
locations where geographical features resulted in significantly different
patterns of ozone variation due to the relative dominance of different
dispersion, emission and chemical processes. The entire network results show
very large variations in ozone concentration that take place on short time- and
distance scales across the Los-Angeles region. Such patterns were not captured
by the more sparsely distributed stations of the existing regulatory network

(i.e. mixed heterostructures) via weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions and
systematically investigate the dependence of their interfacial thermal

configurations of multilayer in-plane Gr/h-BN heterostructures (MIGHHs)
decrease with increasing layer number n and both saturate at n = 3. And
surprisingly, we find that the MIGHH is more advantageous to interfacial
thermal transport than the monolayer in-plane Gr/h-BN heterostructure, which is
in strong contrast to the commonly held notion that the multilayer structures
of Gr and h-BN suppress the phonon transmission. The underlying physical
mechanisms for these puzzling phenomena are probed through the analyses of heat
flux, temperature jump, stress concentration factor, overlap of phonon
vibrational spectra and phonon participation ratio. In particular, by changing
the stacking angle of MIGHH, a higher ITC can be obtained due to the thermal
rectification behavior. Furthermore, we find that the ITC in MIGHH can be
well-regulated by controlling the coupling strength between layers. Our
findings here are of significance for understanding the interfacial thermal
transport behaviors of multilayer in-plane Gr/h-BN heterostructure, and are
expected to attract extensive interest in exploring its new physics and

trained by using several thousand annotated projection X-ray images. The
trained model is capable of identifying the location of the prostate target for
a given input X-ray projection image. To assess the accuracy of the approach,
three patients with prostate cancer received volumetric modulated arc therapy
(VMAT) were retrospectively studied. The results obtained by using the deep
learning model and the actual position of the prostate were compared
quantitatively. The deviations between the target positions obtained by the
deep learning model and the corresponding annotations ranged from 1.66 mm to
2.77 mm for anterior-posterior (AP) direction, and from 1.15 mm to 2.88 mm for
lateral direction. Target position provided by deep learning model for the kV
images acquired using OBI is found to be consistent that derived from the
fiducials. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that highly accurate
markerless prostate localization based on deep learning is achievable. The
strategy provides a clinically valuable solution to daily patient positioning

a bias-free representation of the question. In this work, we investigate the
strengths and shortcomings of AdvReg with the goal of better understanding how
it affects inference in VQA models. Despite achieving a new state-of-the-art on
VQA-CP, we find that AdvReg yields several undesirable side-effects, including
unstable gradients and sharply reduced performance on in-domain examples. We
demonstrate that gradual introduction of regularization during training helps
to alleviate, but not completely solve, these issues. Through error analyses,
we observe that AdvReg improves generalization to binary questions, but impairs
performance on questions with heterogeneous answer distributions.
Qualitatively, we also find that regularized models tend to over-rely on visual

suggest that AdvReg requires further refinement before it can be considered a

that heat ""stops"" diffusing. By analogy to the wave physics framework, the
motionless and moving temperature profiles are manifestations of the
anti-parity-time APT symmetry and symmetry breaking states, respectively. Their
experimental setup consists of two thermally coupled rings rotating in the
opposite direction. At a particular rotation speed, known as the exceptional
point, the APT symmetry of the system changes, resulting in the temperature
profile switching between stationary and moving states. In fact, this seemingly
unusual and exotic behavior can be elegantly captured and predicted using a
conventional heat transfer framework with similarity and scaling analysis. In
this work, we show the system behavior can be characterized into three zones by
two widely-used dimensionless parameters on a regime map. The exceptional
point, discovered using wave physics, is located precisely on the zone boundary
on the regime map, indicating a balance between the contribution of thermal
coupling and mechanical motion. Furthermore, the observed cessation of thermal
diffusion is merely a result of the long diffusion time constant of the

This is no trivial matter due to the possible inconsistencies between the

well-mixed gas cloud, which is consistent with previous studies. We also
present a kinematic analysis, which suggests that most of our program stars
likely belong to the inner-halo population, with orbits passing as close as
$\sim$ 2.9 kpc from the Galactic center. We discuss the implications of these

computer-aided design and motivates the very recent direct modeling paradigm,
which features intuitive push-pull manipulation of the model geometry. In
mechanical design, a substantial part of B-rep models being used are quadric
models (composed of linear and quadric surfaces). However, push-pulling such
models is not trivial due to the possible smooth face-face connections in the
models. The major issue is that, during push-pull moves, it is often desirable
to preserve these connections for functional, manufacturing, or aesthetic
reasons, but this could cause complex inconsistencies between the geometry and
topology in the model and lead to robustness issues in updating the model. The
challenge lies in effectiveness towards detecting the instants when
geometry-topology inconsistencies occur during push-pull moves. This paper
proposes a novel reverse detection method to solve the challenge and then,
based on it, presents a robust method for push-pull direct modeling while
preserving smooth connections. Case studies and comparisons have been conducted
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

that reduces to the so-called momentum-exchange model in the short-range

current correlation function, which is related to the thermal conductivity via
the Green--Kubo formula. From the time-decay of the current correlation, we
show three qualitatively crucial results. First, the anomalous exponent in the
time-decay {\it continuously} changes as a function of the index of the
long-range interaction. Second, there is a regime where the current correlation
diverges as increasing the system size with fixed time, and hence the exponent
of the time-decay cannot be defined. Third, even momentum-nonconserving systems

numbers in a rational homology $3$-sphere $Y$. Assume the link complement
$X:=Y\setminus\nu(L)$ has nondegenerate Thurston norm. In this paper, we study
when a Thurston norm-minimizing surface $S$ properly embedded in $X$ remains
norm-minimizing after Dehn filling all boundary components of $X$ according to
$\partial S$ and capping off $\partial S$ by disks. In particular, for $n=2$
the capped-off surface is norm-minimizing when $[S]$ lies outside of a finite
set of rays in $H_2(X,\partial X;\mathbb{R})$. When $Y$ is an integer homology
sphere this gives an upper bound on the number of surgeries on $L$ which may
yield $S^1\times S^2$. The main techniques come from Gabai's proof of the
Property R conjecture and related work.

we derive the AV map from the near-IR color excess of the IRSF data updated

the N(H) maps of the different velocity components to successfully decompose it

detail features with decoder semantic features through nested connections,

salient objects. In addition, we construct the first publicly available optical

PointNLM captures the long-range relationship between the point clouds via a

methods applied to inference and learning. We revisit here some of these
methods using high-temperature expansions for disordered systems initiated by
Plefka, Georges and Yedidia. We derive the Gibbs free entropy and the
subsequent self-consistent equations for a generic class of statistical models
with correlated matrices and show in particular that many classical
approximation schemes, such as adaptive TAP, Expectation-Consistency, or the
approximations behind the Vector Approximate Message Passing algorithm all rely
on the same assumptions, that are also at the heart of high-temperature
expansions. We focus on the case of rotationally invariant random coupling
matrices in the `high-dimensional' limit in which the number of samples and the
dimension are both large, but with a fixed ratio. This encapsulates many widely
studied models, such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines or Generalized Linear
Models with correlated data matrices. In this general setting, we show that all
the approximation schemes described before are equivalent, and we conjecture
that they are exact in the thermodynamic limit in the replica symmetric phases.
We achieve this conclusion by resummation of the infinite perturbation series,
which generalizes a seminal result of Parisi and Potters. A rigorous derivation
of this conjecture is an interesting mathematical challenge. On the way to
these conclusions, we uncover several diagrammatical results in connection with
free probability and random matrix theory, that are interesting independently
of the rest of our work.

clustering problems such as $k$-means and $k$-median: given a set of $n$ data
points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and a binary type associated to each data point, the
goal is to cluster the points while ensuring that the proportion of each type
in each cluster is roughly the same as its underlying proportion. Subsequent
work has focused on either extending this setting to when each data point has
multiple, non-disjoint sensitive types such as race and gender [6], or to
address the problem that the clustering algorithms in the above work do not
scale well. The main contribution of this paper is an approach to clustering
with fairness constraints that involve multiple, non-disjoint types, that is
also scalable. Our approach is based on novel constructions of coresets: for
the $k$-median objective, we construct an $\varepsilon$-coreset of size
$O(\Gamma k^2 \varepsilon^{-d})$ where $\Gamma$ is the number of distinct
collections of groups that a point may belong to, and for the $k$-means
objective, we show how to construct an $\varepsilon$-coreset of size $O(\Gamma
k^3\varepsilon^{-d-1})$. The former result is the first known coreset
construction for the fair clustering problem with the $k$-median objective, and
the latter result removes the dependence on the size of the full dataset as in
[39] and generalizes it to multiple, non-disjoint types. Plugging our coresets
into existing algorithms for fair clustering such as [5] results in the fastest
algorithms for several cases. Empirically, we assess our approach over the
\textbf{Adult}, \textbf{Bank}, \textbf{Diabetes} and \textbf{Athlete} dataset,
and show that the coreset sizes are much smaller than the full dataset. We also
achieve a speed-up to recent fair clustering algorithms [5,6] by incorporating
our coreset construction.

established that it is a $T_0$-compactification of $X$. Such compactification
of $X$ possesses the extension property for continuous functions, though it
lacks Hausdorffness in general. Therefore, it is natural to search for
condition(s) under which it becomes Hausdorff. In the last section, a set of
necessary and sufficient conditions for such compactification to become a
Stone-Ceck compatification, is finally arrived at.

  overexpanded nozzle with free shock separation","submitted to the Journal of Fluid Mechanics",,"10.1017/jfm.2020.280",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A delayed detached eddy simulation (DDES) of an overexpanded nozzle flow with
shock-induced separation is carried out at a Reynolds number equal to 1.7 10^7.
The flow unsteadiness, characterised by self-sustained shock oscillations,
induces local unsteady loads on the nozzle wall as well as global off-axis
forces. A clear physical understanding of the driving factors of the
unsteadiness is still lacking. Under the current conditions, the nozzle
operates in a highly-overexpanded regime and comprises a conical separation
shock within the nozzle contour, merging into a Mach disk in the nozzle centre.
Our current study focuses on the unsteady pressure signature on the nozzle
wall, through the use of Fourier-based spectral analysis performed in time and
in the azimuthal wavenumber space. The numerical data well agrees with the
experimental measurements in terms of mean and fluctuating wall pressure
statistics. The frequency spectra are characterised by the presence of a large
bump in the low frequency range associated to a breathing motion of the shock
system and a broad and high amplitude peak at high frequencies generated by the
turbulent activity of the detached shear layer. Moreover, a distinct peak at an
intermediate frequency (of the order 1000 Hz) is observed to persist in the
wall-pressure spectra along the nozzle wall. The analysis of the pressure
signals in the azimuthal wavenumber space indicates that this peak is clearly
associated to the first (non-symmetrical) pressure mode and it is thus
connected to the generation of side loads. Furthermore, it is found that the
unsteady Mach disk is characterised by an intense vortex shedding activity and
the interaction of these vortices with the second shock cell is a key factor in
the sustainment of an aeroacoustic feedback loop within the nozzle.

of multiple-identity images (MIIs)---face images stored in a database that
resemble multiple persons, such that novel images of any of the constituent
persons are verified as matching the identity of the MII. Research on this mode
of attack has focused on defence by detection, with no explanation as to why
the vulnerability exists. New quantitative results are presented that support
an explanation in terms of the geometry of the representations spaces used by
the verification systems. In the spherical geometry of those spaces, the
angular distance distributions of matching and non-matching pairs of face
representations are only modestly separated, approximately centred at 90 and
40-60 degrees, respectively. This is sufficient for open-set verification on
normal data but provides an opportunity for MII attacks. Our analysis considers
ideal MII algorithms, demonstrating that, if realisable, they would deliver
faces roughly 45 degrees from their constituent faces, thus classed as matching
them. We study the performance of three methods for MII generation---gallery
search, image space morphing, and representation space inversion---and show
that the latter two realise the ideal well enough to produce effective attacks,
while the former could succeed but only with an implausibly large gallery to
search. Gallery search and inversion MIIs depend on having access to a facial
comparator, for optimisation, but our results show that these attacks can still
be effective when attacking disparate comparators, thus securing a deployed
comparator is an insufficient defence.

that we make, meaning that each covariate has a different and unknown variance.
The goal of the decision maker is then to figure out on the fly the optimal way
to allocate the total budget of $T$ samples between covariates, as sampling
several times a specific one will reduce the variance of the estimated model

to minimize the $\ell^2$-loss $\mathbb{E}

minimizing the trace of the covariance matrix of the problem, which corresponds
then to online A-optimal design. Combining techniques from bandit and convex

cross entropy function. However, applying the loss in this manner assumes
conditional independence of each label given the input, and thus cannot
accurately express inter-label dependencies. To address this issue, we
introduce an adversarial training scheme that operates directly on the

satisfies the inequality d > $\sqrt$ r $\times$ l. This conjecture has been
proven by M. Nagata in 1959, if r is a perfect square greater than 9. Up to
now, it remains open for every non-square r $\ge$ 10, after more than a half
century of attention by many researchers. In this paper, we formulate new
transcendental versions of this conjecture coming from pluripotential theory
and which are equivalent to a version in C n of the Nagata Conjecture.

diamond lattices of septivalent Os (d1) ions tetrahedrally coordinated by four
oxide ions without local inversion symmetry; hence an antisymmetric spin-orbit
coupling is expected in the crystals. The K and Rb compounds have Weiss
temperatures of theta = -66 and -18 K, effective magnetic moments of mu_eff =
1.44 and 1.45 mu_B/Os, and antiferromagnetic transition temperatures of T_N =

exhibiting a first-order structural transition at T_s = 152.5 K. The decline of
the Os moment from 1.73 mu_B/Os for the simple d1 spin, particularly for Cs, is
likely to originate from the antiparallel orbital moment, although the
spin-orbit coupling is generally quenched in the low-lying e orbitals.

electromagnetic and thermal response of aerospace materials due to their
interaction with a plasma arc under lightning strike conditions. Current
approaches treat the interaction between these two states of matter either in a
decoupled manner or through one-way coupled 'co-simulation'. In this paper a
methodology for multiphysics simulations of two-way interaction between
lightning and elastoplastic materials is presented, which can inherently
capture the non-linear feedback between these two states of matter. This is
achieved by simultaneously solving the magnetohydrodynamic and the
elastoplastic systems of equations on the same computational mesh, evolving the
magnetic and electric fields dynamically. The resulting model allows for the
topological evolution and movement of the arc attachment point coupled to the
structural response and Joule heating of the substrate. The dynamic
communication between the elastoplastic material and the plasma is facilitated
by means of Riemann problem-based ghost fluid methods. This two-way coupling,
to the best of the authors' knowledge, has not been previously demonstrated.
The proposed model is first validated against experimental laboratory studies,
demonstrating that the growth of the plasma arc can be accurately reproduced,
dependent on the electrical conductivity of the substrate. It is then
subsequently evaluated in a setting where the dynamically-evolved properties
within the substrate feed back into the plasma arc attachment. Results are
presented for multi-layered substrates of different materials, and for a
substrate with temperature-dependent electrical conductivity. It is
demonstrated that these conditions generate distinct behaviour due to the
interaction between the plasma arc and the substrate.

extreme value problems, spatial pooling of information is the standard approach
for marginal tail estimation. We propose the first extreme value spatial
clustering methods which account for both the similarity of the marginal tails
and the spatial dependence structure of the data to determine the appropriate
level of pooling. Spatial dependence is incorporated in two ways: to determine
the cluster selection and to account for dependence of the data over sites
within a cluster when making the marginal inference. We introduce a statistical
model for the pairwise extremal dependence which incorporates distance between
sites, and accommodates our belief that sites within the same cluster tend to
exhibit a higher degree of dependence than sites in different clusters. We use
a Bayesian framework which learns about both the number of clusters and their
spatial structure, and that enables the inference of site-specific marginal
distributions of extremes to incorporate uncertainty in the clustering
allocation. The approach is illustrated using simulations, the analysis of
daily precipitation levels in Norway and daily river flow levels in the UK.

where large amount of redundant data can be generated very quickly via packet

We explore here the use of Bayesian coresets, a technique that reduces the

distribution using Bayesian learning. We analyze how Bayesian coresets affect
the accuracy of learned models, and how time-space requirements are traded-off,
both in a static scenario and in a streaming scenario.

two types of smoothness assumption: the potential has a Lipschitz-continuous

coded multicasting gain by exploiting coding into multiple transmitted signals.
The goal of coded caching design is to jointly optimize the placement and
delivery scheme so as to minimize the amount of transmitted coded signals.
However, few research efforts consider multiple-round coded caching design
problem, in which fixed and mobile users may coexist in one network different
number of active users present in successive rounds. Obviously, such dynamic
network configurations may lead to undesired frequent placement caching content
updating at user sides, if we assume coded caching scheme for each round
separately. Thus how to tailor the coded caching design, such that the frequent
caching content updating in the placement phase can be avoided, and
simultaneously retaining full caching gain in delivery phase in multiple rounds
will become highly desirable. In this paper, by carefully examining the
bipartite graph representation of the coded caching scheme, a dynamic
centralized coded caching design is proposed on the basis of the
concatenating-based placement and the saturating matching based delivery
scheme. Our analysis unveils that, the proposed dynamic coded caching scheme
can realize the flexible coded multicast, and is order optimal.

classify node classes in networks, and have reached the highest accuracy in
multiple node classification tasks. In the absence of available tagged samples,
active learning methods have been developed to obtain the highest accuracy
using the minimal number of queries to an oracle. The current best active
learning methods use the sample class uncertainty as selection criteria.
However, in graph based classification, the class of each node is often related
to the class of its neighbors. As such, the uncertainty in the class of a
node's neighbor may be a more appropriate selection criterion. We here propose
two such criteria, one extending the classical uncertainty measure, and the
other extending the page-rank algorithm. We show that the latter is optimal
when the fraction of tagged nodes is low, and when this fraction grows to one
over the average degree, the regional uncertainty performs better than all
existing methods. While we have tested this methods on graphs, such methods can
be extended to any classification problem, where a distance metrics can be
defined between the input samples.

slow diffusion of cosmic rays could be general around pulsars, and the cosmic
positron spectrum from pulsars could be significantly changed. As a
consequence, the most likely pulsar source of the positron excess, Geminga, is
no more a viable candidate under the additional constraint from Fermi-LAT.
Moreover, the latest measurement by AMS-02 shows a clear cutoff in the positron
spectrum, which sets a strict constraint on the age of the pulsar source.
Considering these new developments we reanalyze the scenario in this work. By
checking all the observed pulsars under the two-zone diffusion scenario, we
propose for the first time that PSR B1055-52 is a very promising source of the
positron excess. B1055-52 can well reproduce both the intensity and the
high-energy cut of the AMS-02 positron spectrum, and may also explain the
H.E.S.S $e^-+e^+$ spectrum around 10 TeV. Moreover, if the slow diffusion is
universal in the local interstellar medium, B1055-52 will be the unique
reasonable source of the AMS-02 positron spectrum among the observed pulsars.

sunquakes along the flare ribbon (Sharykin & Kosovichev 2018; Zhao & Chen

(HMI) line-of-sight (LOS) and Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope observations to show
evidence of the chromospheric response to these sunquakes. Analysis of the Ca
II 8542 \AA\space line profiles of the wavefronts revealed that the crests
produced a strong blue asymmetry, whereas the troughs produced at most a very
slight red asymmetry. We used the combined HMI, SST datasets to create
time-distance diagrams and derive the apparent transverse velocity and
acceleration of the response. These velocities ranged from 4.5 km s$^{-1}$ to
29.5 km s$^{-1}$ with a constant acceleration of 8.6 x 10$^{-3}$ km s$^{-2}$.
We employed NICOLE inversions, in addition to the Center-of-Gravity (COG)
method to derive LOS velocities ranging 2.4 km s$^{-1}$ to 3.2 km s$^{-1}$.
Both techniques show that the crests are created by upflows. We believe that
this is the first chromospheric signature of a flare induced sunquake.

tracks multiple non-rigid soft surface using its onboard sensor measurements.
An elaborate analysis is conducted on conventional deformation modelling
method, Embedded Deformation (ED) graph. We demonstrate and prove that the ED
graph widely used in such scenarios is unobservable and leads to multiple
solutions unless suitable priors are provided. Example as well as theoretical
prove are provided to show the ambiguity of ED graph and camera pose. In
modelling non-rigid scenario with ED graph, motion priors of the deforming
environment is essential to separate robot pose and deforming environment. The
conclusion can be extrapolated to any free form deformation formulation. In
solving the observability, this research proposes a preliminary deformable SLAM
approach to estimate robot pose in complex environments that exhibits regular
motion. A strategy that approximates deformed shape using a linear combination
of several previous shapes is proposed to avoid the ambiguity in robot movement
and rigid and non-rigid motions of the environment. Fisher information matrix
rank analysis with a base case is discussed to prove the effectiveness.
Moreover, the proposed algorithm is validated extensively on Monte Carlo
simulations and real experiments. It is demonstrated that the new algorithm
significantly outperforms conventional rigid SLAM and ED based SLAM especially
in scenarios where there is large deformation.

the magnetic response at a particular energy and momentum transfer upon

case of iron-based superconductors, the neutron resonance has been extensively
studied experimentally, and a peculiar spin-space anisotropy has been
identified by polarized inelastic neutron scattering experiments. Here we
perform a theoretical study of the energy- and spin-resolved magnetic
susceptibility in the superconducting state with $ s_{+-} $-wave order
parameter, relevant to iron-pnictide and iron-chalcogenide superconductors. Our
model is based on a realistic bandstructure including spin-orbit coupling with
electronic Hubbard-Hund interactions included at the RPA level. Spin-orbit
coupling is taken into account both in the generation of spin-fluctuation
mediated pairing, as well as the numerical computation of the spin
susceptibility in the superconducting state. We find that spin-orbit coupling
and superconductivity in conjunction can reproduce the salient experimentally
observed features of the magnetic anisotropy of the neutron resonance. This
includes the possibility of a double resonance, the tendency for a $c$-axis
polarized resonance, and the existence of enhanced magnetic anisotropy upon
entering the superconducting phase.

According to the visibility probability, tiles are classified as viewport,
marginal and invisible tiles. The server-side tile rate allocation problem for

to minimize the overall received video distortion of all users and the quality
difference between the viewport and marginal tiles of each user, subject to the

develop a steepest descent algorithm to solve this non-linear discrete

experimental measurements at nonzero filling factor $N/N_{2D}$, where $N$ is
the total number of atoms and $N_{2D}$ is the threshold number to reach the 2D

important to know how the superconducting pairing emerges from the unusual
normal states of cuprate superconductors, including pseudogap, anomalous Fermi
liquid and strange metal (SM). A long-standing issue under debate is how the
superconducting pairing is formed and condensed in the SM phase because the
superconducting transition temperature is the highest in this phase. Here, we
report the first experimental observation of a pressure-induced crossover from
two- to three-dimensional superconducting states in the optimally-doped
Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta bulk superconductor at a pressure above 2.8 GPa, through
state-of-the-art in-situ high-pressure measurements of resistance,
magnetoresistance and magnetic susceptibility. By analyzing the temperature
dependence of resistance, we find that the two-dimensional (2D) superconducting
transition exhibits a Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like behavior. The
emergence of this 2D superconducting transition provides direct and strong
evidence that the SM state is predominantly 2D-like. This is important to a
thorough understanding of the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors.

providing an alternative to pivot translation which also allows us to better

  In this work, we carried out an investigation on this capability of the
multilingual NMT models. First, we intentionally create an encoder architecture
which is independent with respect to the source language. Such experiments shed
light on the ability of NMT encoders to learn multilingual representations, in
general. Based on such proof of concept, we were able to design regularization
methods into the standard Transformer model, so that the whole architecture
becomes more robust in zero-shot conditions. We investigated the behaviour of
such models on the standard IWSLT 2017 multilingual dataset. We achieved an
average improvement of 2.23 BLEU points across 12 language pairs compared to
the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art multilingual system.

observational data in healthcare, civics, e-commerce, and beyond. One big
hurdle to policy learning is a commonplace lack of overlap in the data for
different actions, which can lead to unwieldy policy evaluation and poorly
performing learned policies. We study a solution to this problem based on
retargeting, that is, changing the population on which policies are optimized.
We first argue that at the population level, retargeting may induce little to
no bias. We then characterize the optimal reference policy and retargeting
weights in both binary-action and multi-action settings. We do this in terms of
the asymptotic efficient estimation variance of the new learning objective.
Extensive empirical results in a simulation study and a case study of
personalized job counseling demonstrate that retargeting is a fairly easy way
to significantly improve any policy learning procedure applied to observational
data.

clinics to make a variety of measurements related to tissue viscoelastic
properties. These instruments include elastography imaging scanners,
rheological shear viscometers, and a variety of calibrated stress-strain
analyzers. From these many sources of disparate data, a common step in
analyzing results is to fit the measurements of tissue response to some
viscoelastic model. In the best scenario, this places the measurements within a
theoretical framework and enables meaningful comparisons of the parameters
against other types of tissues. However, there is a large set of established
rheological models, even within the class of linear, causal, viscoelastic solid
models, so which of these should be chosen? Is it simply a matter of best fit
to a minimum mean squared error of the model to several data points? We argue
that the long history of biomechanics, including the concept of the extended
relaxation spectrum, along with data collected from viscoelastic soft tissues
over an extended range of times and frequencies, and the theoretical framework
of multiple relaxation models which model the multi-scale nature of physical
tissues, all lead to the conclusion that fractional derivative models represent
the most succinct and meaningful models of soft tissue viscoelastic behavior.
These arguments are presented with the goal of clarifying some distinctions
between, and consequences of, some of the most commonly used models, and with
the longer term goal of reaching a consensus among different sub-fields in
acoustics, biomechanics, and elastography that have common interests in
comparing tissue measurements.

systematically treat total derivatives and boundary terms, which has led to
some confusion about how exactly to apply the formalism in the presence of
boundaries. In particular the original construction of the canonical
Hamiltonian relies on the assumed existence of a certain boundary quantity
""$B$"", whose physical interpretation has not been clear. We here give an
algorithmic procedure for applying the covariant phase space formalism to field
theories with spatial boundaries, from which the term in the Hamiltonian
involving $B$ emerges naturally. Our procedure also produces an additional
boundary term, which was not present in the original literature and which so
far has only appeared implicitly in specific examples, and which is already
nonvanishing even in general relativity with sufficiently permissive boundary
conditions. The only requirement we impose is that at solutions of the
equations of motion the action is stationary modulo future/past boundary terms
under arbitrary variations obeying the spatial boundary conditions; from this
the symplectic structure and the Hamiltonian for any diffeomorphism that
preserves the theory are unambiguously constructed. We show in examples that
the Hamiltonian so constructed agrees with previous results. We also show that
the Poisson bracket on covariant phase space directly coincides with the
Peierls bracket, without any need for non-covariant intermediate steps, and we
discuss possible implications for the entropy of dynamical black hole horizons.

and the predictive uncertainty that it provides can be used to mitigate risk of

We derive analytically a bound on the prediction loss with respect to

Furthermore, we apply a Bayesian Neural Network to the MIMIC-III dataset,
predicting risk of mortality of ICU patients. Our empirical results show that
uncertainty can indeed prevent potential errors and reliably identifies
out-of-domain patients. These results suggest that Bayesian predictive

the operation of installed components, we can wait-and-see (second stage). To
identify a sustainable design, we need to account for both economical and
environmental criteria leading to multi-objective optimization problems.
However, multi-objective optimization leads not to one optimal design but to
multiple Pareto-efficient design options in general. Thus, the decision maker
usually has to decide manually which design should finally be implemented.
  In this paper, we propose the flexible here-and-now decision (flex-hand)
approach for automatic identification of one single design for multi-objective
optimization. The approach minimizes the distance of the Pareto front based on
one fixed design to the Pareto front allowing multiple designs. Uncertainty
regarding parameters of future operations can be easily included through a
robust extension of the flex-hand approach.
  Results of a real-world case study show that the obtained design is highly
flexible to adapt operation to the considered objective functions. Thus, the
design provides an energy system with the ability to adapt to a changing focus
in decision criteria, e. g., due to changing political aims.

scenarios obtaining labels is expensive, time-consuming and might require
expert knowledge. This has motivated the fast development of semi-supervised
techniques, whose performance is on a par with or better than supervised
approaches. A current major challenge for semi-supervised techniques is how to
better handle the network calibration and confirmation bias problems for
improving performance. In this work, we argue that energy models are an
effective alternative to such problems. With this motivation in mind, we
propose a hybrid framework for semi-supervised classification called CREPE
model (1-Lapla$\mathbf{C}$ian g$\mathbf{R}$aph $\mathbf{E}$nergy for
$\mathbf{P}$seudo-lab$\mathbf{E}$ls). Firstly, we introduce a new energy model
based on the non-smooth $\ell_1$ norm of the normalised graph 1-Laplacian. Our
functional enforces a sufficiently smooth solution and strengthens the
intrinsic relation between the labelled and unlabelled data. Secondly, we
provide a theoretical analysis for our proposed scheme and show that the
solution trajectory does converge to a non-constant steady point. Thirdly, we
derive the connection of our energy model for pseudo-labelling. We show that
our energy model produces more meaningful pseudo-labels than the ones generated
directly by a deep network. We extensively evaluate our framework, through
numerical and visual experiments, using six benchmarking datasets for natural
and medical images. We demonstrate that our technique reports state-of-the-art

both optimization w.r.t. the action sequences initialized from the policy
network, and also online optimization directly w.r.t. the parameters of the
policy network. We show that POPLIN obtains state-of-the-art performance in the
MuJoCo benchmarking environments, being about 3x more sample efficient than the
state-of-the-art algorithms, such as PETS, TD3 and SAC. To explain the

parameter space is smoother than in action space. Further more, we found the

extensive research on quantifying how data features influence model
predictions. Feature influence can be direct (a direct influence on model
outcomes) and indirect (model outcomes are influenced via proxy features).
Feature influence can also be expressed in aggregate over the training or test
data or locally with respect to a single point. Current research has typically
focused on one of each of these dimensions. In this paper, we develop
disentangled influence audits, a procedure to audit the indirect influence of
features. Specifically, we show that disentangled representations provide a
mechanism to identify proxy features in the dataset, while allowing an explicit
computation of feature influence on either individual outcomes or
aggregate-level outcomes. We show through both theory and experiments that
disentangled influence audits can both detect proxy features and show, for each
individual or in aggregate, which of these proxy features affects the
classifier being audited the most. In this respect, our method is more powerful
than existing methods for ascertaining feature influence.

Extinction by interstellar grains induces modulations of a given photolelectric

grains. We simulated data of instruments with characteristics of resolution and
sensitivity of the current Athena, XRISM and Arcus concepts. In the relatively
near future, the depletion and abundances of the elements under study will be
determined with confidence. In the case of carbon and sulfur, the
characterization of the chemistry of the absorbing dust will be also
determined, depending on the dominant compound. For aluminum and calcium,
despite the large depletion in the interstellar medium and the prominent dust
absorption, in many cases the edge feature may not be changing significantly
with the change of chemistry in the Al$^-$ or Ca$^-$ bearing compounds. The
exinction signature of large grains may be detected and modeled, allowing a
test on different grain size distributions for these elements. The low cosmic
abundance of Ti and Ni will not allow us a detailed study of the edge features.

create conditions conducive for their regeneration; this is the proposal of
Sellwood and Carlberg, based on simulations of stellar disks. The linear
response of an axisymmetric stellar disk, to an adiabatic non-axisymmetric
transient mode, gives a final distribution function (DF) that is equal to the
initial DF everywhere in phase space, except at the Lindblad and corotation
resonances where the final DF is singular. We use the nonlinear theory of
adiabatic capture into resonance to resolve the singularities and calculate the
finite changes in the DF. These take the form of axisymmetric ""scars""
concentrated around resonances, whose DFs have simple general forms. Global
changes in the physical properties are explored for a cool Mestel disk: we
calculate the DFs of scars, and estimate the changes in the disk angular
momentum, surface density and orbital frequencies leading to shifts of
resonances. Resonant torques between disk stars and any new linear
non-axisymmetric mode are suppressed within a scar, as is epicyclic heating.
Since all the resonances of a linear mode with the same angular wavenumber and
pattern speed as its precursor lie inside the scars of the precursor, it
suffers less damping. Hence, scars filter the spectrum of noise-generated
modes, promoting the renewal of a few select modes. Relic scars sustained by a
galaxy disk, due to past tidal interaction with a passing companion, may still
be active enablers of non-axisymmetric modes, such as the two-armed ""grand
design"" spiral patterns.

Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics (MPCD) to be able to deal with soft,
polymeric colloids. Our methods build on the knowledge of the monomer density
profile that can be obtained from monomer-resolved simulations without
hydrodynamics or from theoretical arguments. We hereby propose two different
approaches. The first one simply extends the MPCD method by including in the
simulations effective monomers with a given density profile, thus neglecting
monomer-monomer interactions. The second one considers the macromolecule as a
single penetrable soft colloid (PSC), which is permeated by an inhomogeneous
distribution of solvent particles. By defining an appropriate set of rules to
control the collision events between the solvent and the soft colloid, both
linear and angular momenta are exchanged. We apply these methods to the case of
linear chains and star polymers for varying monomer lengths and arm number,
respectively, and compare the results for the dynamical properties with those
obtained within monomer-resolved simulations. We find that the effective
monomer method works well for linear chains, while the PSC method provides very
good results for stars. These methods pave the way to extend MPCD treatments to
complex macromolecular objects such as microgels or dendrimers and to work with
soft colloids at finite concentrations.

merging binary black holes (BHs). The evolution of such binaries is driven by
interactions with other stars, most notably, binary-single interactions.
Traditionally, so-called `strong' interactions are believed to be the driving
force in this evolution. However, we recently showed that more distant, i.e.,
""weak"" or ""secular"" encounters, can have important implications for the
properties of merging BH binaries in globular clusters. This motivates more
detailed understanding of the effects of secular encounters on a binary. In
another previous paper, we analytically calculated expressions for the changes
of the eccentricity and angular-momentum vectors taking into account
second-order (SO) perturbation theory, and showed that, for highly eccentric
binaries, the new expressions give rise to behavior that is not captured by
first-order (FO) theory. Here, we extend our previous work to third order (TO)
perturbation theory. We also include terms up to and including octupole order.
The latter are nonzero for binaries with unequal component masses. In addition,
we consider the effects of post-Newtonian terms, and we determine the
steady-state distribution due to the cumulative effect of secular encounters by
computing the associated angular-momentum diffusion coefficients, and applying
the Fokker-Planck equation. Together with our previous work, the results in
this paper provide a framework for incorporating the effects of distant

Virtual reality (VR) provides an alternative to create immersive working

consequently, a serious fall. Previous studies showed that VR is a promising
tool for measuring the impact of height on the postural sway. However, most of
these studies used the treadmill as the walking locomotion apparatus in a
virtual environment (VE). This paper was focused on natural walking locomotion
to reduce the inherent postural perturbations of VR devices. To investigate the
impact of virtual height on gait characteristics and keep the level of realism
and feeling of presence at their highest, we enhanced the
first-person-character model with ""virtual legs"". Afterward, we investigated
its effect on the gait parameters of the participants with and without the
presence of height. To that end, twelve healthy adults were asked to walk on a
virtual loop path once at the ground level and once at the 17th floor of an
unfinished structure. By quantitatively comparing the participants' gait
pattern results, we observed a decrease in the stride length and increase in
the gait duration of the participants exposed to height. At the ground level,
the use of the enhanced model reduced participants' average stride length and
height. The results of this study help us understand users' behaviors when they
were exposed to elevated surfaces and establish a firm ground for gait
stability analysis for the future height-related VR studies. We expect this
developed VR platform can generate reliable results of VR application in more
construction safety studies.

Neural networks traditionally produce a scalar value for an activated neuron.
Capsules, on the other hand, produce a vector of values, which Hinton argues
correspond to a single, composite feature wherein the values of the components
of the vectors indicate properties of the feature such as transformation or
contrast. We present a new way of parameterizing and training capsules that we
refer to as homogeneous vector capsules (HVCs). We demonstrate, experimentally,
that altering a convolutional neural network (CNN) to use HVCs can achieve
superior classification accuracy without increasing the number of parameters or
operations in its architecture as compared to a CNN using a single final fully
connected layer. Additionally, the introduction of HVCs enables the use of
adaptive gradient descent, reducing the dependence a model's achievable
accuracy has on the finely tuned hyperparameters of a non-adaptive optimizer.
We demonstrate our method and results using two neural network architectures.
First, a very simple monolithic CNN that when using HVCs achieved a 63%
improvement in top-1 classification accuracy and a 35% improvement in top-5
classification accuracy over the baseline architecture. Second, with the CNN
architecture referred to as Inception v3 that achieved similar accuracies both
with and without HVCs. Additionally, the simple monolithic CNN when using HVCs
showed no overfitting after more than 300 epochs whereas the baseline showed
overfitting after 30 epochs. We use the ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 classification
challenge dataset with both networks.

to lesser-known aspects of Einstein's paper such as his failure to test his
model against observation, his failure to consider the stability of the model
and a slight mathematical confusion concerning the introduction of the
cosmological constant term. Taken in conjunction with his later cosmological

mass dependence of the lensing properties of the galaxy sample. We analyse to
what extent models assuming the Planck18 cosmology fit to the number density
and clustering can accurately predict the small-scale lensing signal. In
qualitative agreement with previous BOSS studies at redshift $z \sim 0.5$ and
with results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we find that the expected
signal at small scales ($0.1 < r_{\rm p} < 3 \, h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$) is higher
by $\sim 25\%$ than what is measured. Here, we show that this result is
persistent over the redshift range $0.1 < z < 0.7$ and for galaxies of
different stellar masses. If interpreted as evidence for cosmological
parameters different from the Planck CMB findings, our results imply $S_8 =
\sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m} / 0.3} = 0.744 \pm 0.015$, whereas $S_8 = 0.832
\pm 0.013$ for Planck18. However, in addition to being in tension with CMB
results, such a change in cosmology alone does not accurately predict the
lensing amplitude at larger scales. Instead, other often neglected systematics
like baryonic feedback or assembly bias are likely contributing to the
small-scale lensing discrepancy. We show that either effect alone, though, is
unlikely to completely resolve the tension. Ultimately, a combination of the
two effects in combination with a moderate change in cosmological parameters
might be needed.

the mass of the fermions. Assuming the scalar decays into electrons and muons,
it can manifest cleaner experimental signatures. In this paper we suggest that
a singly-charged scalar singlet, with electroweak production, can start to be
probed in the near future with dedicated search strategies. Depending on the
strength of the Yukawa couplings, two independent scenarios are considered:
direct pair-production (small couplings) and single-production via virtual
neutrino exchange (large couplings). We show that, up to a mass as large as 500

running the computation-intensive web render engine on a specific processor

utility function to quickly search for the optimal processor setting to
carefully trade responsive time for reduced energy consumption. We integrate
our techniques to the open-source Chromium browser and apply it to two
representative mobile user events: scrolling and pinching (i.e., zoom in and

hottest websites and two big.LITTLE heterogeneous mobile platforms. Our
extensive experiments show that the proposed approach reduces the system-wide

formation of a majority Nb2N phase while the morphology shows granular nature

metal-to-superconductor transition featuring two distinct transition regions.
The region close to the normal state varies strongly with the film thickness,
whereas, the second region in the vicinity of the superconducting state remains
almost unaltered but exhibiting resistive tailing. The current-voltage
characteristics also display wide transition embedded with intermediate
resistive states originated by phase slip lines. The transition width in
current and the number of resistive steps depend on film thickness and they
both increase with decrease in thickness. The broadening in transition width is
explained by progressive establishment of superconductivity through proximity
coupled superconducting nano-grains while finite size effects and quantum
fluctuation may lead to the resistive tailing. Finally, by comparing with Nb
control samples, we emphasize that Nb2N offers unconventional superconductivity
with promises in the field of phase slip based device applications.

use surface brightness (SB) profiles and g-i colour maps to obtain information
on the internal structure of these galaxies and find signatures of the
mechanisms that drive their evolution in high-density environment, which is
inside the virial radius of the cluster. By modelling galaxy isophotes, we
extract the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles in four optical
bands. We also derive g-i colour profiles, and structural parameters like total
magnitude and effective radius. For 10 of the galaxies in this sample, we
observe a clear discontinuity in their SB profiles, derive their break radius
(Br), and classify their disc-breaks into Type-II (down-bending) or Type-III
(up-bending). We find that Type-II galaxies have bluer average (g-i) colour in
their outer discs while Type-III galaxies are redder. Br increases with stellar
mass and molecular gas mass while decreases with molecular gas-fractions. The
inner and outer scale-lengths increase monotonically with absolute magnitude,
as found in other works. In Fornax, galaxies with morphological type 5< T< 9
(~60 % of the sample) are located beyond the high-density, ETG-dominated
regions, but no correlation found between T and the disc-break type. The main
results of this work suggest that the disc-breaks of LTGs inside the virial
radius of the Fornax cluster seem to have arisen through a variety of
mechanisms, which is evident in their outer-disc colours and the absence of
molecular gas beyond their break radius in some cases. This can result in a
variety of stellar populations inside and outside the break radii.

methods, few-shot sequence labeling poses a unique challenge as it also calls
for modeling the label dependencies. To consider both the item similarity and
label dependency, we propose to leverage the conditional random fields (CRFs)
in few-shot sequence labeling. It calculates emission score with similarity
based methods and obtains transition score with a specially designed transfer
mechanism. When applying CRF in the few-shot scenarios, the discrepancy of
label sets among different domains makes it hard to use the label dependency
learned in prior domains. To tackle this, we introduce the dependency transfer
mechanism that transfers abstract label transition patterns. In addition, the
similarity methods rely on the high quality sample representation, which is
challenging for sequence labeling, because sense of a word is different when
measuring its similarity to words in different sentences. To remedy this, we
take advantage of recent contextual embedding technique, and further propose a
pair-wise embedder. It provides additional certainty for word sense by
embedding query and support sentence pairwisely. Experimental results on slot
tagging and named entity recognition show that our model significantly
outperforms the strongest few-shot learning baseline by 11.76 (21.2%) and 12.18

Numerical simulations are carried out on a reduced model to show the

of the scattering matrix and the power delivered by the system. Finally, an
experimental implementation validate the potential of programmable boundary

present sufficient conditions in terms of multiple generalized Lyapunov

specifically, we show that even if the value of the generalized Lyapunov
functions increase between consecutive switches, finite-time stability can be
guaranteed if the finite-time convergent mode is active long enough. In
contrast to earlier work where the Lyapunov functions are required to be
decreasing during the continuous flows and non-increasing at the discrete
jumps, we allow the generalized Lyapunov functions to increase \emph{both}
during the continuous flows and the discrete jumps. As thus, the derived
stability results are less conservative compared to the related literature.

the sky of the AdS bulk from a point on the boundary. Using the formula, we
demonstrate that, for a thermal state dual to the Schwarzschild-AdS$_4$

Decision Process (MDP) for which the expected shortest path from any state to

states and $A$ possible actions per state. Upon choosing an action $a_t$ at
state $s_t$, one receives a real value reward $r_t$, then one transits to a
next state $s_{t+1}$. The reward $r_t$ is generated from a fixed reward
distribution depending only on $(s_t, a_t)$ and similarly, the next state
$s_{t+1}$ is generated from a fixed transition distribution depending only on
$(s_t, a_t)$. The objective is to maximize the accumulated rewards after $T$
interactions. In this paper, we consider the case where the reward
distributions, the transitions, $T$ and $D$ are all unknown. We derive the
first polynomial time Bayesian algorithm, BUCRL{} that achieves up to logarithm
factors, a regret (i.e the difference between the accumulated rewards of the
optimal policy and our algorithm) of the optimal order
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{DSAT})$. Importantly, our result holds with high
probability for the worst-case (frequentist) regret and not the weaker notion
of Bayesian regret. We perform experiments in a variety of environments that
demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over previous techniques.

interest. In particular, we derive a sharper upper bound for the KL-divergence
of Bernoulli random variables. We also derive sharper upper and lower bounds
for Beta and Binomial quantiles. All the bound are very simple and only use

included in this study. The left eye was measured four times with a corneo
scleral topographer (Eye Surface Profiler). From the raw anterior eye height
data of each measurement, topographical limbus was demarcated and fitted in
three dimensions to a circle, an ellipse and a Fourier series. Root mean square
error (RMSE) was calculated to evaluate the goodness of fit. In addition, white

important control problem in power systems. A key challenge is the large number
of (partially uncertain) parameters and decision variables that increase the
computational burden and that complicate the structured consideration of
uncertainties. Reducing the number of decision variables by means of
aggregation can alleviate these issues. However, despite the frequent use of
aggregation for storage, few works in the literature provide formal
justification. In the present paper, we investigate aggregation of
heterogeneous (storage) devices with time-varying power and energy constraints.
In particular, we propose mild conditions on the constraints of each device
guaranteeing the applicability of an aggregated model in scheduling without any
loss of optimality in comparison to the complete problem. We conclude with a

  derivation from spaceborne altimeter measurements",,,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent research shows that the surface wave energy dissipation, which is the
vertical energy flux across the air-sea interface, can be calculated as the
product of air density, reference wind speed cubed and an energy transfer
coefficient determined by the dimensionless parameters made of wind speed,
significant wave height and dominant wave period. In a similar way, the
horizontal wave energy flux of wind generated waves can be represented by the
same dimensionless wind and wave parameters. Satellite altimeters routinely
report reference wind speed and significant wave height. An algorithm to derive
the characteristic wave period of ocean waves in the altimeter footprint using
the similarity properties of ocean wind and waves is described. The vertical
and horizontal energy fluxes derived from the satellite altimeter are in very
good agreement with the estimation from ocean buoy measurements in four
geography locations with significantly different wind and wave climates. The
vertical energy flux follows closely the cubic wind speed dependence,
reflecting the dominance of short wave contribution in wave generation and
breaking dissipation. The wind speed dependence of horizontal energy flux is
much weaker especially in mild to moderate wind speed, reflecting its dominance
by long swell component. Application of the energy flux parameterization
functions to satellite altimeter measurements offers an efficient method of
estimating the air-sea exchange and ocean energy budget in global scale. Such
data are extremely difficult to acquire using other means.

representations, existing studies for entity linking (EL) have resorted to
neural networks to exploit both the local mention-to-entity compatibility and
the global interdependence between different EL decisions for target entity
disambiguation. However, most neural collective EL methods depend entirely upon
neural networks to automatically model the semantic dependencies between
different EL decisions, which lack of the guidance from external knowledge. In
this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network with recurrent
random-walk layers for collective EL, which introduces external knowledge to
model the semantic interdependence between different EL decisions.
Specifically, we first establish a model based on local context features, and
then stack random-walk layers to reinforce the evidence for related EL
decisions into high-probability decisions, where the semantic interdependence
between candidate entities is mainly induced from an external knowledge base.
Finally, a semantic regularizer that preserves the collective EL decisions
consistency is incorporated into the conventional objective function, so that
the external knowledge base can be fully exploited in collective EL decisions.
Experimental results and in-depth analysis on various datasets show that our
model achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art models. Our code

anti-symmetric, free shear, viscoelastic flows obeying the Oldroyd-B
constitutive equation in the limit of low to moderate Reynolds number and
Weissenberg number. The resulting fourth order Orr-Sommerfeld equation is
reduced to a set of six auxiliary equations which are numerically integrated
starting from the rescaled far-field conditions, i.~e., via the Compound Matrix
Method. Numerical results indicate that with increasing Weissenberg number: (a)
the peak of the maximal growth rate (i. e., the maximum value of the imaginary
component of the growth rate) is reduced, (b) the entire range of unstable
spectrum is shifted towards longer waves (i.~e., the entire region of temporal
instability is gradually concentrated near zero wavenumber), (c) the vorticity
structure contours are dilated and (d) the residual Reynolds stresses are
diminished. All these observations suggest that viscoelasticity reduces the
temporal instability but does not completely suppress it. The Briggs idea of
analytic continuation is deployed to classify regions of temporal stability,
absolute and convective instabilties as well as evanescent (false) modes, in a
finite range of Reynolds number, Weissenberg number and the viscosity
coefficient. The main result is that, unlike Newtonian fluids, the free shear
flow of dilute polymeric liquids are either (absolutely/convectively) unstable
for all Reynolds number or the transition to instability occurs at very low
Reynolds number, a finding attributed to the fact that viscoelasticity
aggravates free surface flow instabilities. Although this transitional pathway
connecting the temporally stable state to the elastoinertially unstable state
have been identified by some in-vitro experiments, but until now, has not been
quantified theoretically via linear stability analysis.

simultaneously accounting for the primary X-rays, the secondary X-rays due to

this case, we were able to demonstrate that the shock height is small, based on
the high reflection amplitude, and hence the maximum temperature of the

Despite the high specific accretion rate required to explain the small shock
height, we do not detect any spin modulation in our NuSTAR data, consistent
with the modest amount of complex absorption seen spectroscopically. We argue
that our results are robust because they are based on the joint
temporal-spectral analysis of broadband X-ray data. The spectrum of V2731 Oph
is more highly absorbed. Through our analysis of the Suzaku data, we present a
spectral model with nitrogen overabundance without the previously claimed soft
blackbody that should be further explored. We have been unable to constrain

to SSA production. Parameters are formulated to represent surface processes
with characteristic length scales over a broad range, from tens of meters to a
few centimeters. The result shows that the correlation coefficients between SSA
properties (number, volume and flux) and surface process parameters improve
toward the shortest length scale. This suggests that whereas surface wave
breaking is a necessary initial and boundary condition, the final state of the
atmospheric SSA properties is controlled primarily by turbulent processes
characterized by the ocean surface roughness. The investigation also reveals
distinct differences of the SSA properties in rising winds and falling winds,
with higher efficiency of breaking production in low or falling winds. Previous
studies show that the length scale of breaking waves is shorter in mixed seas
than in wind seas. Combining the observations together, it is suggestive that
larger air cavities are entrained in rising winds (with wind seas more likely).
The larger air cavities escape before they can be fully broken down into small
bubbles for the subsequent SSA production. In contrast, the shorter breakers in
low or falling winds (with mixed seas more likely) trap smaller air cavities

buoyancy is developed following the observation that the entrained bubble plume
buoyancy constitutes a large portion of the breaking wave energy dissipation.
The formulation leads to estimations of an effective or equivalent-buoyancy
depth of bubble entrainment as well as the volume and surface area of bubbles
entrained by surface wave breaking. The results show that the air-water
interface area per unit sea surface area is enhanced dramatically by the
entrained bubbles: on the order of 10 m^2 at about 15 m/s wind speed. The
effective entrainment depth represents the vertical reach of the bubble plume
as if all the bubbles were collected into this depth. Based on empirical
observations of whitecaps and breaking wave energy dissipation, it is about
0.11 m and relatively independent on wind speed. The void fraction of the top
meter ocean layer is related linearly to the whitecap coverage with a
proportionality factor of 0.11. The nearly-constant effective entrainment depth
essentially renders the bubble entrainment process during the active wave
breaking stage into a lateral 2D problem. Published high speed video recordings
of bubble plume evolution appear to support this conclusion. Consistent with
the nearly-constant effective entrainment depth, relevant breaking wave speeds
are within a narrow range between about 2 and 3.5 m/s and depend on wind speed
only weakly. Whitecap observations can also be used to quantify some elusive
breaking properties such as the breaking strength parameter b relating the
breaking energy dissipation rate and length of breaking front.

object detectors, notably the YOLOv3 detector. Unlike previous work on physical
object detection attacks, which required the patch to overlap with the objects
being misclassified or avoiding detection, we show that a properly designed
patch can suppress virtually all the detected objects in the image. That is, we
can place the patch anywhere in the image, causing all existing objects in the
image to be missed entirely by the detector, even those far away from the patch
itself. This in turn opens up new lines of physical attacks against object
detection systems, which require no modification of the objects in a scene. A

industry is an automated detection of defects of small sizes on specular car
body surfaces. A new statistical learning approach is presented for surface
finish defect detection based on spline smoothing method for feature extraction
and $k$-nearest neighbour probabilistic classifier. Since the surfaces are
specular, structured lightning reflection technique is applied for image
acquisition. Reduced rank cubic regression splines are used to smooth the pixel
values while the effective degrees of freedom of the obtained smooths serve as
components of the feature vector. A key advantage of the approach is that it
allows reaching near zero misclassification error rate when applying standard
learning classifiers. We also propose probability based performance evaluation
metrics as alternatives to the conventional metrics. The usage of those
provides the means for uncertainty estimation of the predictive performance of
a classifier. Experimental classification results on the images obtained from
the pilot system located at Volvo GTO Cab plant in Ume{\aa}, Sweden, show that
the proposed approach is much more efficient than the compared methods.

However, achieving desired negative differential resistance characteristics,

little consensus on the underlying mechanism and unclear design criteria. Here,
we report a material-independent model of current-controlled negative
differential resistance to explain a broad range of characteristics, including
the origin of the discontinuous snap-back response observed in many transition
metal oxides. This is achieved by explicitly accounting for a non-uniform
current distribution in the oxide film and its impact on the effective circuit
of the device, rather than a material-specific phase transition. The
predictions of the model are then compared with experimental observations to
show that the continuous S-type and discontinuous snap-back characteristics
serve as fundamental building blocks for composite behaviour with higher
complexity. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our approach for
predicting and engineering unconventional compound behaviour with novel
functionality for emerging electronic and neuromorphic computing applications.

activating multiple D2D pairs within the serving cell. This ensures that the
same radio resource will be reused across the primary LTE UEs and different D2D

neighboring LTE primary users. We model the system and show via extensive

Norbert Wiener on Brownian motion in the early 1920s. This view is not false
and we show in this article that Wiener used the first path integral of the
history of physics to describe the Brownian motion. That said, Wiener, as he
pointed out, was inspired by the work of some French mathematicians,
particularly Gateaux and Levy. Moreover, although Richard Feynman has
independently found this notion, we show that in the course of the 1930s, while
searching a kind of geometrization of quantum mechanics, another French
mathematician, Adolphe Buhl, noticed by the philosopher Gaston Bachelard, had
himself been close to forge such a notion. This reminder does not detract from
the remarkable discovery of Feynman, which must undeniably be attributed to
him. We also show, however, that the difficulties of this notion had to wait
many years before being resolved, and it was only recently that the path
integral could be rigorously established from a mathematical point of view.

provider of the worlds electricity, while effects of global climate change
unfold. This development begs the question: is climate change affecting the
energy production of solar cells? In this article, we attempt to answer this
question looking backward and forward. We start by analyzing recent trends for
global meteorological conditions and solar cell performance parameters,
covering the ten-year period between 20016 and 2015. We leverage a
field-verified performance model for two of the most well-established solar
cell technologies that also feature very different sensitivities to changing
operating conditions: silicon and cadmium telluride. We find that climate
change has already left its mark: ten years ago, silicon solar panels -- on
average -- generated 4 kWh per m2 more power than today. Correlating solar cell
performance ratio changes and changes in operating conditions, we find that
temperature globally is the leading factor for silicon (-0.52 pm 0.03% per K),
accounting for approx. 85% of the observed effect. Water related light
absorption in the atmosphere is most likely responsible for much of the
remaining contribution. To predict how future solar cell performance is
affected, we focus on the implications of raising temperatures. For the end of
the 21st century, we project that silicon PV panels globally will suffer
performance reductions of between 0.7% and 2.5% (8 to 30 kWh per kWp in North
America), depending on the global warming scenario. These reductions will
result in significant socioeconomic penalties, particularly in a world that
produces a significant portion of its electricity from PV panels, and
especially if additional effects of global warming, like accelerated panel
degradation and extreme weather are considered.
