(2018) 757-762",,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automated 3D pose estimation of satellites and other known space objects is a
critical component of space situational awareness. Ground-based imagery offers
a convenient data source for satellite characterization; however, analysis
algorithms must contend with atmospheric distortion, variable lighting, and
unknown reflectance properties. Traditional feature-based pose estimation
approaches are unable to discover an accurate correlation between a known 3D
model and imagery given this challenging image environment. This paper presents
an innovative method for automated 3D pose estimation of known space objects in
the absence of satisfactory texture. The proposed approach fits the silhouette
of a known satellite model to ground-based imagery via particle filtering. Each
particle contains enough information (orientation, position, scale, model
articulation) to generate an accurate object silhouette. The silhouette of
individual particles is compared to an observed image. Comparison is done
probabilistically by calculating the joint probability that pixels inside the
silhouette belong to the foreground distribution and that pixels outside the
silhouette belong to the background distribution. Both foreground and
background distributions are computed by observing empty space. The population
of particles are resampled at each new image observation, with the probability
of a particle being resampled proportional to how the particle's silhouette
matches the observation image. The resampling process maintains multiple pose
estimates which is beneficial in preventing and escaping local minimums.
Experiments were conducted on both commercial imagery and on LEO satellite
imagery. Imagery from the commercial experiments are shown in this paper.

time passes. Aging processes are ubiquitous and play a fundamental role in the
physics of glasses and spin glasses and in other applications (e.g. in
algorithms minimizing complex cost/loss functions). The theory of aging in the
out of equilibrium dynamics of mean-field spin glass models has achieved a
fundamental role, thanks to the asymptotic analytic solution found by
Cugliandolo and Kurchan. However this solution is based on assumptions (e.g.
the weak ergodicity breaking hypothesis) which have never been put under a
strong test until now. In the present work we present the results of an
extraordinary large set of numerical simulations of the prototypical mean-field
spin glass models, namely the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick and the Viana-Bray
models. Thanks to a very intensive use of GPUs, we have been able to run the
latter model for more than $2^{64}$ spin updates and thus safely extrapolate
the numerical data both in the thermodynamical limit and in the large times
limit. The measurements of the two-times correlation functions in isothermal
aging after a quench from a random initial configuration to a temperature
$T<T_c$ provides clear evidence that, at large times, such correlations do not
decay to zero as expected by assuming weak ergodicity breaking. We conclude
that strong ergodicity breaking takes place in mean-field spin glasses aging
dynamics which, asymptotically, takes place in a confined configurational
space. Theoretical models for the aging dynamics need to be revised
accordingly.

an optical or plasmonic cavity is strong enough to overcome the dissipative
process, hybrid light-matter states (polaritons) become the fundamental
excitations in the system. The mixing between the light and matter characters
modifies the photophysical and photochemical properties. Especially, it was
reported that these polaritons can be employed to control photochemical
reactions, charge and energy transfer, and other processes. In addition,
according to recent studies, vibrational strong coupling can be employed to
resonantly enhance the thermally-activated chemical reactions. In this work, a
theoretical model and an efficient numerical method for studying the dynamics
of molecules strongly interacting with quantum light are developed based on
non-adiabatic excited-state molecular dynamics. The methodology was employed to
study the \textit{cis-trans} photoisomerization of a realistic molecule in a
cavity. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the photochemical reactions can
be controlled by tuning the properties of the cavity. In the calculated
example, the isomerization is suppressed when polaritonic states develop a
local minimum on the lower polaritonic state. Moreover, the observed reduction
of isomerization is tunable via the photon energy and light-molecule coupling

information processing. If there are two, pure, non-orthogonal states then both
local and collective schemes are known to reach the Helstrom bound, the maximum
probability of successful discrimination allowed by quantum theory. For mixed
states, it is known that only collective schemes can perform optimally, so it
might be expected that these schemes are more resilient to preparation noise.
We calculate the probability of success for two schemes, one local and one
collective, in the regime of imperfect preparation fidelity. We find two
surprising results. Firstly, both schemes converge upon the same many-copy
limit, which is less than unity. Secondly, the local scheme performs better in
all cases. This highlights the point that one should take into account noise
when designing state discrimination schemes.

any other sort of explicit dark energy fluid. Starting with a modified Newton's
second law, where $G$ is taken as a function of time, we derive the first
Friedmann--Lema{\^i}tre equation, where a second parameter, $G^*$, appears as
the gravitational constant. This parameter is related to the original $G$ from
the second law, which remains in the acceleration equation. We use this
approach to reproduce various cosmological scenarios that are studied in the
literature, and we test these models with low-redshift probes: type-Ia
supernovae (SNIa), baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic chronometers,
taking also into account a possible change in the supernovae intrinsic
luminosity with redshift. As a result, we obtain several models with similar
$\chi^2$ values as the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. When we allow for a
redshift-dependence of the SNIa intrinsic luminosity, a model with a $G$
exponentially decreasing to zero while remaining positive (model 4) can explain
the observations without acceleration. When we assume no redshift-dependence of
SNIa, the observations favour a negative $G$ at large scales, while $G^*$
remains positive for most of these models. We conclude that these models offer
interesting interpretations to the low-redshift cosmological observations,
without needing a dark energy term.

data using $L_1$-norm regularization is considered. The use of the randomized
singular value decomposition methodology facilitates tackling the computational
challenge that arises in the solution of these large-scale inverse problems. As
such the powerful randomized singular value decomposition is used for the
numerical solution of all linear systems required in the algorithm. A
comprehensive comparison of the developed methodology for the inversion of
magnetic and gravity data is presented. These results indicate that there is
generally an important difference between the gravity and magnetic inversion
problems. Specifically, the randomized singular value decomposition is
dependent on the generation of a rank $q$ approximation to the underlying model
matrix, and the results demonstrate that $q$ needs to be larger, for equivalent
problem sizes, for the magnetic problem as compared to the gravity problem.
Without a relatively large $q$ the dominant singular values of the magnetic
model matrix are not well-approximated. The comparison also shows how the use
of the power iteration embedded within the randomized algorithm is used to
improve the quality of the resulting dominant subspace approximation,
especially in magnetic inversion, yielding acceptable approximations for
smaller choices of $q$. The price to pay is the trade-off between approximation
accuracy and computational cost. The algorithm is applied for the inversion of
magnetic data obtained over a portion of the Wuskwatim Lake region in Manitoba,

has the very special property that simultaneously combines both, the
Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) and modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) hierarchies in a
single integrable structure. This relationship between gravitation in
three-dimensional spacetimes and two-dimensional integrable systems is based on
an extension of the recently introduced ""soft hairy boundary conditions"" on
AdS$_3$, where the chemical potentials are now allowed to depend locally on the
dynamical fields and their spatial derivatives. The complete integrable
structure of the Gardner system, i.e., the phase space, the Poisson brackets
and the infinite number of commuting conserved charges, are directly obtained
from the asymptotic analysis and the conserved surface integrals in the
gravitational theory. These boundary conditions have the particular property
that they can also be interpreted as being defined in the near horizon region
of spacetimes with event horizons. Black hole solutions are then naturally
accommodated within our boundary conditions, and are described by static
configurations associated to the corresponding member of the Gardner hierarchy.

function subject to a cardinality constraint in the data stream model.
Previously, the best known algorithm for this problem was a
$5.828$-approximation semi-streaming algorithm based on a local search
technique (Feldman et al., 2018). For the special case of this problem in which
the objective function is also monotone, the state-of-the-art semi-streaming
algorithm is an algorithm known as Sieve-Streaming, which is based on a
different technique (Badanidiyuru, 2014). Adapting the technique of
Sieve-Streaming to non-monotone objective functions has turned out to be a
challenging task, which has so far prevented an improvement over the local
search based $5.828$-approximation. In this work, we overcome the above
challenge, and manage to adapt Sieve-Streaming to non-monotone objective
functions by introducing a ""just right"" amount of randomness into it.
Consequently, we get a semi-streaming polynomial time $4.282$-approximation
algorithm for non-monotone objectives. Moreover, if one allows our algorithm to
run in super-polynomial time, then its approximation ratio can be further
improved to $3 + \varepsilon$.

event-horizon-scale images of the supermassive black hole candidate in the
center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. We have resolved the central compact
radio source as an asymmetric bright emission ring with a diameter of 42+/-3

with a flux ratio ~10:1. The emission ring is recovered using different
calibration and imaging schemes, with its diameter and width remaining stable

observed image is consistent with expectations for the shadow of a Kerr black
hole as predicted by general relativity. The asymmetry in brightness in the
ring can be explained in terms of relativistic beaming of the emission from a
plasma rotating close to the speed of light around a black hole. We compare our
images to an extensive library of ray-traced general-relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes and derive a central mass of M =

to EHT observing wavelengths and the production of instrumentation that can be
deployed on a heterogeneous array of existing telescopes and facilities. To
meet sensitivity requirements, high-bandwidth digital systems were developed
that process data at rates of 64 gigabit/s, exceeding those of currently

general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and synthetic
images produced by general relativistic ray tracing. We compare the observed
visibilities with this library and confirm that the asymmetric ring is
consistent with earlier predictions of strong gravitational lensing of
synchrotron emission from a hot plasma orbiting near the black hole event
horizon. The ring radius and ring asymmetry depend on black hole mass and spin,
respectively, and both are therefore expected to be stable when observed in
future EHT campaigns. Overall, the observed image is consistent with
expectations for the shadow of a spinning Kerr black hole as predicted by
general relativity. If the black hole spin and M87's large scale jet are
aligned, then the black hole spin vector is pointed away from Earth. Models in
our library of non-spinning black holes are inconsistent with the observations
as they do not produce sufficiently powerful jets. At the same time, in those
models that produce a sufficiently powerful jet, the latter is powered by
extraction of black hole spin energy through mechanisms akin to the
Blandford-Znajek process. We briefly consider alternatives to a black hole for
the central compact object. Analysis of existing EHT polarization data and data
taken simultaneously at other wavelengths will soon enable new tests of the

emission region and black hole parameters from these analyses with those
recovered from reconstructed images. There is a remarkable consistency among
all methods and data sets. We find that >50% of the total flux at arcsecond
scales comes from near the horizon, and that the emission is dramatically
suppressed interior to this region by a factor >10, providing direct evidence
of the predicted shadow of a black hole. Across all methods, we measure a

single-particle basis. The result is equivalent to that of the so-called
variation after particle-number projection in the HFB case, but now the
particle number is always conserved and the time-consuming projection is
avoided. Specifically, we derive the analytical expression for the gradient of
the average energy with respect to changes of the canonical basis, which is
then used in the family of gradient minimizers to iteratively minimize energy.
In practice, we find the so-called ADAM minimizer (adaptive moments of

the computer time cost (in the HFB case) is several times that of solving HF by
the gradient minimizers. We hope the new algorithm could become a common

webs of causality and policy variables. FCMs are fuzzy signed directed graphs
that allow degrees of causal influence and event occurrence. Such causal models
can simulate a wide range of policy scenarios and decision processes. Their
directed loops or cycles directly model causal feedback. Their nonlinear
dynamics permit forward-chaining inference from input causes and policy options
to output effects. Users can add detailed dynamics and feedback links directly
to the causal model or infer them with statistical learning laws. Users can
fuse or combine FCMs from multiple experts by weighting and adding the
underlying fuzzy edge matrices and do so recursively if needed. The combined
FCM tends to better represent domain knowledge as the expert sample size
increases if the expert sample approximates a random sample. Many causal models
use more restrictive directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and Bayesian probabilities.
DAGs do not model causal feedback because they do not contain closed loops.
Combining DAGs also tends to produce cycles and thus tends not to produce a new
DAG. Combining DAGs tends to produce a FCM. FCM causal influence is also
transitive whereas probabilistic causal influence is not transitive in general.
Overall: FCMs trade the numerical precision of probabilistic DAGs for pattern
prediction, faster and scalable computation, ease of combination, and richer
feedback representation. We show how FCMs can apply to problems of public
support for insurgency and terrorism and to US-China conflict relations in
Graham Allison's Thucydides-trap framework. The appendix gives the textual
justification of the Thucydides-trap FCM. It also extends our earlier theorem

gravitationally bound at birth. These high-pressure clouds are compressed by
feedback-driven winds and/or collisions of smaller clouds/gas streams in highly
gas-rich, turbulent environments. The newly formed clusters follow a power-law
mass function of dN/dM~M^-2. The cluster formation efficiency is similar across
galaxies with stellar masses of ~10^7-10^10 Msun at z>5. The age spread of
cluster stars is typically a few Myrs and increases with cluster mass. The
metallicity dispersion of cluster members is ~0.08 dex in [Z/H] and does not
depend on cluster mass significantly. Our findings support the scenario that
present-day old globular clusters (GCs) were formed during relatively normal
star formation in high-redshift galaxies. Simulations with a stricter/looser

of a correlation measurement technique, we detect the back-action of a single

coherence time, even in such a large system. We repeatedly let the qubit
interact with the spin bath and measure its state. Between such cycles, the

filtering problem in which filtering performs the maximal compression of
relevant information contained in inputs (arrays of zeroes and ones). This
problem serves as a reference model for the statistics of filtering and related
sampling problems. The filter patterns in this problem conveniently allow a
microscopic, combinatorial consideration. This allows us to find the statistics
of outputs, namely the exact distribution of output degeneracies, for arbitrary
input sizes. We observe that the resulting degeneracy distribution of outputs
decays as $e^{-c\log^\alpha \!d}$ with degeneracy $d$, where $c$ is a constant
and exponent $\alpha>1$, i.e. faster than a power law. Importantly, its form
essentially depends on the size of the input data set, appearing to be closer
to a power-law dependence for small data set sizes than for large ones. We
demonstrate that for sufficiently small input data set sizes typical for
empirical studies, this distribution could be easily perceived as a power law.

the shortest filter pattern provides the maximum informative representations of

constraints on black hole populations from optical, UV and X-ray studies, we
find that they lead to widely different black hole number densities and halo
occupation fractions which are currently observationally unconstrained. In
terms of future electromagnetic spectrum observations, the faint-end quasar
luminosity function and the low-mass-end black hole-host galaxy scaling
relations are very sensitive to the specific massive seed prescription.
Specifically, the direct collapse model exhibits a seeding efficiency which
decreases rapidly with cosmic time and produces much fewer black holes in low
mass galaxies, in contrast to the original Illustris simulation. We further
find that the total black hole merger rate varies by more than one order of
magnitude for different seed models, with the redshift evolution of the chirp
mass changing as well. Supermassive black hole merger detections with LISA and
International Pulsar Timing Array may hence provide the most direct means of
constraining massive black hole seed formation in the early Universe.

of the broad-line region (BLR) in active galactic nuclei. However, inferring
physical BLR properties from an observed spectroscopic time series is a
difficult inverse problem. Here, we present a blind test of two widely used RM
methods: MEMEcho (developed by Horne) and CARAMEL (developed by Pancoast and
collaborators). The test data are simulated spectroscopic time series that
track the H$\alpha$ emission line response to an empirical continuum light
curve. The underlying BLR model is a rotating, biconical accretion disc wind,
and the synthetic spectra are generated via self-consistent ionization and
radiative transfer simulations. We generate two mock data sets, representing
Seyfert galaxies and QSOs. The Seyfert model produces a largely *negative*
response, which neither method can recover. However, both fail
$``gracefully''$, neither generating spurious results. For the QSO model both
CARAMEL and expert interpretation of MEMEcho's output both capture the broadly
annular, rotation-dominated nature of the line-forming region, though MEMEcho
analysis overestimates its size by 50%, but CARAMEL is unable to distinguish
between additional inflow and outflow components. Despite fitting individual
spectra well, the CARAMEL velocity-delay maps and RMS line profiles are
strongly inconsistent with the input data. Finally, since the H$\alpha$
line-forming region is rotation dominated, neither method recovers the disc
wind nature of the underlying BLR model. Thus considerable care is required
when interpreting the results of RM analyses in terms of physical models.

Retrieval with Private Coded Side Information (PIR-PCSI) problem. In this
problem, there is a database of $K$ messages whose copies are replicated across
$N$ servers, and there is a user who knows a random linear combination of a
random subset of $M$ messages in the database as side information. The user
wishes to download one message from the servers, while protecting the

information. We assume that the servers know the number of messages forming the
user's side information in advance, whereas the indices of these messages and
their coefficients in the side information are not known to any of the servers
a priori.
  Our goal is to characterize (or derive a lower bound on) the capacity, i.e.,
the maximum achievable download rate, for the following two settings. In the
first setting, the set of messages forming the linear combination available to
the user as side information, does not include the user's demanded message. For
this setting, we show that the capacity is equal to
$\left(1+{1}/{N}+\dots+{1}/{N^{K-M-1}}\right)^{-1}$. In the second setting, the
demand message contributes to the linear combination available to the user as

user's side information. For this setting, we show that the capacity is
lower-bounded by $\left(1+{1}/{N}+\dots+{1}/{N^{K-M}}\right)^{-1}$. The
proposed achievability schemes and proof techniques leverage ideas from both

that for both the sudden quench and the finite-time quench, a topological phase

nonanalyticity in the first-order or second-order derivative of circuit
complexity with respect to time in the short-time regime, and a topological

to generalize the notion of an exactly marginal deformation. Without a
boundary, one must find an operator of protected scaling dimension $\Delta$
equal to the space-time dimension $d$ of the conformal field theory, while with
a boundary, as long as the operator dimension is protected, one can make up for
the difference $d-\Delta$ by including a factor $z^{\Delta-d}$ in the
deformation where $z$ is the distance from the boundary. This coordinate
dependence does not lead to a reduction in the underlying $SO(d,1)$ global
conformal symmetry group of the boundary conformal field theory. We show that
such terms can arise from boundary flows in interacting field theories.
Ultimately, we would like to be able to characterize what types of boundary
conformal field theories live on the orbits of such deformations. As a first
step, we consider a free scalar with a conformally invariant mass term $z^{-2}
\phi^2$, and a fermion with a similar mass. We find a connection to double
trace deformations in the AdS/CFT literature.

rotating regular-dS black holes with an additional cosmological horizon apart

without strong assumptions on the outcome-generating process. Appropriately
using covariates further yields more precise estimators in randomized
experiments. R. A. Fisher suggested blocking on discrete covariates in the
design stage or conducting analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in the analysis
stage. We can embed blocking into a wider class of experimental design called
rerandomization, and extend the classical ANCOVA to more general regression
adjustment. Rerandomization trumps complete randomization in the design stage,
and regression adjustment trumps the simple difference-in-means estimator in
the analysis stage. It is then intuitive to use both rerandomization and
regression adjustment. Under the randomization-inference framework, we
establish a unified theory allowing the designer and analyzer to have access to
different sets of covariates. We find that asymptotically (a) for any given
estimator with or without regression adjustment, rerandomization never hurts
either the sampling precision or the estimated precision, and (b) for any given
design with or without rerandomization, our regression-adjusted estimator never
hurts the estimated precision. Therefore, combining rerandomization and
regression adjustment yields better coverage properties and thus improves
statistical inference. To theoretically quantify these statements, we discuss
optimal regression-adjusted estimators in terms of the sampling precision and

enabling a feedback loop to regulate tissue growth. However, the interplay
between cell-cell adhesion strength, local cell density and force fluctuations
in regulating cell proliferation is poorly understood. Here, we show that
spatial variations in the tumor growth rates, which depend on the location of
cells within tissue spheroids, are strongly influenced by cell-cell adhesion.
As the strength of the cell-cell adhesion increases, intercellular pressure
initially decreases, enabling dormant cells to more readily enter into a
proliferative state. We identify an optimal cell-cell adhesion regime where
pressure on a cell is a minimum, allowing for maximum proliferation. We use a
theoretical model to validate this novel collective feedback mechanism coupling
adhesion strength, local stress fluctuations and proliferation.Our results,
predicting the existence of a non-monotonic proliferation behavior as a
function of adhesion strength, are consistent with experimental results.
Several experimental implications of the proposed role of cell-cell adhesion in
proliferation are quantified, making our model predictions amenable to further
experimental scrutiny. We show that the mechanism of contact inhibition of
proliferation, based on a pressure-adhesion feedback loop, serves as a unifying
mechanism to understand the role of cell-cell adhesion in proliferation.

second shortest cyanopolyyne (HC$_{2n+1}$N), is abundant around some massive
young stellar objects (MYSOs), which is not predicted by classical carbon-chain
chemistry. For example, the observed HC$_{5}$N abundance toward the
G28.28$-$0.36 MYSO is higher than that in L1527, which is one of the warm
carbon chain chemistry (WCCC) sources, by more than one order of magnitude
(Taniguchi et al., 2017). In this paper, we present chemical simulations of
hot-core models with a warm-up period using the astrochemical code Nautilus. We
find that the cyanopolyynes are formed initially in the gas phase and accreted
onto the bulk and surface of granular ice mantles during the lukewarm phase,
which occurs at $25 < T < 100$ K. In slow warm-up period models, the peak
abundances occur as the cyanopolyynes desorb from dust grains after the
temperature rises above 100 K. The lower limits of the abundances of HC$_{5}$N,
CH$_{3}$CCH, and CH$_{3}$OH observed in the G28.28$-$0.36 MYSO can be
reproduced in our hot-core models, after their desorption from dust grains.
Moreover, previous observations suggested chemical diversity in envelopes
around different MYSOs. We discuss possible interpretations of relationships
between stages of the star-formation process and such chemical diversity, such
as the different warm-up timescales. This timescale depends not only on the
mass of central stars but also on the relationship between the size of warm
regions and their infall velocity.

linguists have suggested that a tree's ""true"" punctuation marks are not
observed (Nunberg, 1990). These latent ""underlying"" marks serve to delimit or
separate constituents in the syntax tree. When the tree's yield is rendered as
a written sentence, a string rewriting mechanism transduces the underlying
marks into ""surface"" marks, which are part of the observed (surface) string but
should not be regarded as part of the tree. We formalize this idea in a
generative model of punctuation that admits efficient dynamic programming. We
train it without observing the underlying marks, by locally maximizing the
incomplete data likelihood (similarly to EM). When we use the trained model to
reconstruct the tree's underlying punctuation, the results appear plausible
across 5 languages, and in particular, are consistent with Nunberg's analysis
of English. We show that our generative model can be used to beat baselines on
punctuation restoration. Also, our reconstruction of a sentence's underlying

significant number of old, metal-poor globular clusters. We investigate
early-time neutron-star mergers as the mechanism for this enrichment. Through
both numerical modeling and analytical arguments, we show that neutron-star
mergers cannot be induced through dynamical interactions early in the history
of the cluster, even when the most liberal assumptions about neutron-star
segregation are assumed. Therefore, if neutron-star mergers are the primary
mechanism for r-process dispersion in globular clusters, they likely result
from the evolution of isolated, primordial binaries in the clusters. Through
population modeling, we find that moderate fractions of GCs with enrichment are
only possible when a significant number of double neutron-star progenitors
proceed through Case BB mass transfer --- under various assumptions for the
initial properties of globular clusters, a neutron-star merger with the
potential for enrichment will occur in ~15-60% (~30-90%) of globular clusters
if this mass transfer proceeds stably (unstably). The strong anti-correlation
between the pre-supernova orbital separation and post-supernova systemic
velocity due to mass loss in the supernova leads to efficient ejection of most
enrichment candidates from their host clusters. Thus, most enrichment events
occur shortly after the double neutron stars are born. This requires
star-forming gas that can absorb the r-process ejecta to be present in the
globular cluster 30-50 Myr after the initial burst of star formation. If
scenarios for redistributing gas in globular clusters cannot act on these
timescales, the number of neutron-star merger enrichment candidates drops
severely, and it is likely that another mechanism, such as r-process enrichment
from collapsars, is at play.

essential for benign overfitting in this setting: the number of directions in
parameter space that are unimportant for prediction must significantly exceed
the sample size. By studying examples of data covariance properties that this
characterization shows are required for benign overfitting, we find an
important role for finite-dimensional data: the accuracy of the minimum norm

narrower range of properties of the data distribution when the data lies in an
infinite dimensional space versus when the data lies in a finite dimensional

Synchrotron-producing REs were generated during low density, Ohmic, diverted
plasma discharges in the Alcator C-Mod tokamak. The ten-channel Motional Stark
Effect diagnostic was used to measure spatial profiles of the polarization
angle $\theta_{\mathrm{pol}}$ and the fraction $\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{pol}}$ of

$\theta_{\mathrm{pol}}$ of 90$\deg$---from horizontal to vertical polarization
and vice versa---are observed in experimental data and are well-explained by
the gyro-motion of REs and high directionality of synchrotron radiation.
Polarized synchrotron emission is modeled with the synthetic diagnostic SOFT;
its output Green's (or detector response) functions reveal a critical RE pitch
angle at which $\theta_{\mathrm{pol}}$ flips by 90$\deg$ and
$\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{pol}}$ is minimal. Using SOFT, we determine the dominant
RE pitch angle which reproduces measured $\theta_{\mathrm{pol}}$ and
$\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{pol}}$ values. The spatiotemporal evolutions of

for one C-Mod discharge. For channels viewing REs near the magnetic axis and
flux surfaces $q$ = 1 and 4/3, disagreements between synthetic and experimental

Furthermore, other sources of pitch angle scattering, not considered in this

dynamical information about chiral molecules, from the microwave to the extreme
ultraviolet range. Most schemes employ circularly or elliptically polarized
radiation, and more sophisticated configurations involve, for instance, light
pulses with time-varying polarization states. In all these schemes, the
polarization state of light is always considered as constant over one optical
cycle. In this study, we zoom into the optical cycle in order to resolve and
control a subcyle attosecond chiroptical process. We engineer an electric field
whose instantaneous chirality can be controlled within the optical cycle, by
combining two phase-locked orthogonally polarized fundamental and second
harmonic fields. While the composite field has zero net ellipticity, it shows
an instantaneous optical chirality which can be controlled via the two-color
delay. We theoretically and experimentally investigate the photoionization of
chiral molecules with this controlled chiral field. We find that electrons are
preferentially ejected forward or backward relative to the laser propagation
direction depending on the molecular handedness, similarly to the
well-established photoelectron circular dichroism process. However, since the
instantaneous chirality switches sign from one half cycle to the next,
electrons ionized from two consecutive half cycles of the laser show opposite
forward/backward asymmetries. This chiral signal provides a unique insight into
the influence of instantaneous chirality in the dynamical photoionization
process. Our results demonstrate the important role of sub-cycle polarization
shaping of electric fields, as a new route to study and manipulate chiroptical

and machine learning, used as a generic method to obtain a small yet
""representative"" subset of the data. In this work, we investigate the
robustness of sampling against adaptive adversarial attacks in a streaming
setting: An adversary sends a stream of elements from a universe $U$ to a
sampling algorithm (e.g., Bernoulli sampling or reservoir sampling), with the
goal of making the sample ""very unrepresentative"" of the underlying data
stream. The adversary is fully adaptive in the sense that it knows the exact
content of the sample at any given point along the stream, and can choose which
element to send next accordingly, in an online manner.
  Well-known results in the static setting indicate that if the full stream is
chosen in advance (non-adaptively), then a random sample of size $\Omega(d /
\varepsilon^2)$ is an $\varepsilon$-approximation of the full data with good
probability, where $d$ is the VC-dimension of the underlying set system
$(U,R)$. Does this sample size suffice for robustness against an adaptive
adversary? The simplistic answer is \emph{negative}: We demonstrate a set
system where a constant sample size (corresponding to VC-dimension $1$)
suffices in the static setting, yet an adaptive adversary can make the sample
very unrepresentative, as long as the sample size is (strongly) sublinear in
the stream length, using a simple and easy-to-implement attack.
  However, this attack is ""theoretical only"", requiring the set system size to
(essentially) be exponential in the stream length. This is not a coincidence:
We show that to make Bernoulli or reservoir sampling robust against adaptive
adversaries, the modification required is solely to replace the VC-dimension
term $d$ in the sample size with the cardinality term $\log |R|$. This nearly
matches the bound imposed by the attack.

false data injection (FDI) attack against AC SE with ANN: by injecting a
deliberate attack vector into measurements, the attacker can degrade the
accuracy of ANN SE while remaining undetected. We propose a population-based
algorithm and a gradient-based algorithm to generate attack vectors. The
performance of these algorithms is evaluated through simulations on IEEE 9-bus,
14-bus and 30-bus systems under various attack scenarios. Simulation results
show that DE is more effective than SLSQP on all simulation cases. The attack
examples generated by DE algorithm successfully degrade the ANN SE accuracy
with high probability.

existing signal model that simultaneously combines linear time invariant (LTI)

sparsity-assisted signal denoising (SASD) by combining our proposed filter

consists in accretion of planetesimals, bodies 1-1000 km in size, from smaller

good observational constraints on the complex physical processes that
contribute to planetesimal formation. In the outer solar system, the best place
to look for clues is the Kuiper belt, where icy planetesimals survived to this
day. Here we report evidence that Kuiper belt planetesimals formed by the
streaming instability, a process in which aerodynamically concentrated clumps
of pebbles gravitationally collapse into 100-km-class bodies. Gravitational
collapse was previously suggested to explain the ubiquity of equal-size
binaries in the Kuiper belt. We analyze new hydrodynamical simulations of the
streaming instability to determine the model expectations for the spatial
orientation of binary orbits. The predicted broad inclination distribution with
80% of prograde binary orbits matches the observations of trans-Neptunian
binaries. The formation models which imply predominantly retrograde binary
orbits can be ruled out. Given its applicability over a broad range of
protoplanetary disk conditions, it is expected that the streaming instability
seeded planetesimal formation also elsewhere in the solar system, and beyond.

distinguishing molecular absorption signatures in a measured transmission
spectrum from the varying intensity or ""baseline"" of the light source. Baseline
correction becomes particularly difficult when the measurement involves
complex, broadly absorbing molecules or non-ideal transmission effects such as
etalons. We demonstrate a technique that eliminates the need to account for the
laser intensity in absorption spectroscopy by converting the measured
transmission spectrum of a gas sample to a modified form of the time-domain
molecular free induction decay (m-FID) using a cepstral analysis technique
developed for audio signal processing. Much of the m-FID signal is temporally
separated from and independent of the source intensity, and this portion can be
fit directly with a model to determine sample gas properties without correcting
for the light source intensity. We validate the new approach in several complex
absorption spectroscopy scenarios and discuss its limitations. The technique is

two-dimensional platform for semiconductor devices. One such application,
whereby the added low dimensional crystal physics (i.e. optical spin selection
rules) may prove TMDs a competitive candidate, are quantum dots as qubits. The
band structure of TMD monolayers offers a number of different degrees of
freedom and combinations thereof as potential qubit bases, primarily electron
spin, valley isospin and the combination of the two due to the strong spin
orbit coupling known as a Kramers qubit. Pure spin qubits in monolayer MoX$_2$
(where X=S or Se) can be achieved by energetically isolating a single valley
and tuning to a spin degenerate regime within that valley by a combination of a
sufficiently small quantum dot radius and large perpendicular magnetic field.
Within such a TMD spin qubit, we theoretically analyse single qubit rotations
induced by electric dipole spin resonance. We employ a rotating wave
approximation within a second order time dependent Schrieffer-Wolf effective
Hamiltonian to derive analytic expressions for the Rabi frequency of single
qubit oscilations, and optimise the mechanism or the parameters to show
oscilations up to $250\,{\rm MHz}$.

Engineering (SE) research is to provide relevant evidence to practice. In
health related fields, Rapid Reviews (RRs) have shown to be an effective method
to achieve that goal. However, little is known about how the SE research
community perceives the potential applicability of RRs. Aims: The goal of this
study is to understand the SE research community viewpoints towards the use of
RRs as a means to provide evidence to practitioners. Method: To understand
their viewpoints, we invited 37 researchers to analyze 50 opinion statements
about RRs, and rate them according to what extent they agree with each
statement. Q-Methodology was employed to identify the most salient viewpoints,
represented by the so called factors. Results: Four factors were identified:
Factor A groups undecided researchers that need more evidence before using RRs;
Researchers grouped in Factor B are generally positive about RRs, but highlight
the need to define minimum standards; Factor C researchers are more skeptical
and reinforce the importance of high quality evidence; Researchers aligned to
Factor D have a pragmatic point of view, considering RRs can be applied based
on the context and constraints faced by practitioners. Conclusions: In
conclusion, although there are opposing viewpoints, there are also some common
grounds. For example, all viewpoints agree that both RRs and Systematic Reviews
can be poorly or well conducted.

for the stability statement associated with the spacetime version of the

true. This conjecture is then established under the assumption of spherical
symmetry in all dimensions. More precisely, it is shown that a sequence of
asymptotically flat initial data satisfying the dominant energy condition,
without horizons except possibly at an inner boundary, and with ADM masses
tending to zero must arise from isometric embeddings into a sequence of static
spacetimes converging to Minkowski space in the pointed volume preserving
intrinsic flat sense. The difference of second fundamental forms coming from
the embeddings and initial data must converge to zero in $L^p$, $1\leq p<2$. In

increasing electron doping, the plasmon excitations show monotonic hardening in

near the Fermi surface (FS). Importantly, the plasmon excitations evolve from a
broad feature into a well defined peak with much increased life time, revealing
the evolution of the electrons from incoherent states to coherent
quasi-particles near the FS. Such evolution marks the reduction of the

work for large-scale scenarios. The entire system for large-scale 3D point

since the National Football League (NFL) released its Next Gen Stats tracking
data publicly for the first time in December 2018. While tracking datasets in
other sports often contain detailed annotations of on-field events, annotations
in the NFL's tracking data are limited. Methods for creating these annotations
typically require extensive human labeling, which is difficult and expensive.
We begin tackling this class of problems by creating annotations for pass
coverage types by defensive backs using unsupervised learning techniques, which
require no manual labeling or human oversight. We define a set of features from
the NFL's tracking data that help distinguish between ""zone"" and ""man""
coverage. We use Gaussian mixture modeling and hierarchical clustering to
create clusters corresponding to each group, and we assign the appropriate type
of coverage to each cluster through qualitative analysis of the plays in each
cluster. We find that the mixture model's ""soft"" cluster assignments allow for
more flexibility when identifying coverage types. Our work makes possible
several potential avenues of future NFL research, and we provide a basic
exploration of these in this paper.

self-deformation. Despite the diversity of body plans and the complex
challenges of integrating electrical, chemical, and mechanical signals to
achieve such shape changes, in steady forward movement, limbless systems across
scales and environments often use traveling waves of axial body bending.
However, delineating how parameters (wave amplitudes, frequencies) lead to high
locomotor performance (e.g. speed, stability, energy) remains challenging. Here
we show that a geometric framework developed in the last decades by theoretical
physicists and control engineers that replaces complex calculation with a
diagrammatic scheme is well suited to the discovery and comparison of optimal
patterns of wave dynamics in living systems across scales. We focus on a regime
of undulatory locomotion, that of highly damped environments which is
applicable not only to small organism movement in viscous fluids but also to
animals moving in frictional fluids (sand) and on frictional ground. We find
that the traveling wave dynamics used by mm-scale nematode worms and cm-scale
desert-dwelling snakes and lizards can be described by sinusoidal
time-variation of the amplitudes of two sinuous-like modes. These near-circular
paths in a self-deformation space enclose near-maximal surface integral
(geometric phase) across two decades in body length. Thus, the introduction of
techniques from differential geometry into living systems can assist in the
growth of comparative neuromechanics, allowing comparison of self-deformation
dynamics across taxa and providing hypotheses for function at lower levels of

by Nd$_{2}$PdSi$_{3}$ adopting the AlB$_2$-type structure with a single Nd
site, and we do not find evidence for superlattice peaks in neutron
diffraction. Our results confirm the onset of long range magnetic order below
$T_0=17$~K, where the whole sample enters the ordered state. Neutron
diffraction measurements establish the presence of a ferromagnetic component in
this compound, as well as an antiferromagnetic one which has a propagation
vector $\mathbf{k_2}=(1/2,1/2,1/4-\delta)$ with a temperature dependent
$\delta\approx0.02-0.04$, and moments orientated exclusively along the
$c$-axis. $\mu$SR measurements suggest that these components coexist on a
microscopic level, and therefore the magnetic structure of Nd$_{2}$PdSi$_{3}$
is predominantly ferromagnetic, with a sinusoidally modulated antiferromagnetic
contribution which reaches a maximum amplitude at 11~K, and becomes smaller
upon further decreasing the temperature. INS results show the presence of

variables after model or variable selection. Recently, selective inference, a
kind of post-selection inference framework, has garnered the attention in the

variable selection procedure, selective inference can properly control for
so-called selective type I error, which is a type I error conditional on a
variable selection procedure, without imposing excessive additional
computational costs. While selective inference can provide a valid hypothesis
testing procedure, the main focus has hitherto been on Gaussian linear
regression models. In this paper, we develop a selective inference framework
for binary classification problem. We consider a logistic regression model
after variable selection based on marginal screening, and derive the high
dimensional statistical behavior of the post-selection estimator. This enables
us to asymptotically control for selective type I error for the purposes of
hypothesis testing after variable selection. We conduct several simulation
studies to confirm the statistical power of the test, and compare our proposed
method with data splitting and other methods.

large magnetoresistance (XMR) for both YbAs and the nonmagnetic counterpart
LuAs, is also observed, which can consistently be accounted for by the presence
of electron-hole compensation. Moreover, an angle-dependent study of the
Shubnikov-de Haas effect oscillations reveals very similar Fermi surfaces
between YbAs and LuAs, with light effective masses down to at least 0.5 K,
indicating that the Yb-$4f$ electrons are well localized, and do not contribute
to the Fermi surface. However, the influence of the localized Yb-$4f$ electrons

hypotheses with nonnegative weights summing to 1 and a set of tests that each
partition the hypotheses, output a decision tree using the provided tests that
uniquely identifies each hypothesis and has minimum (weighted) average depth.
Previous works showed that the greedy algorithm achieves a $O(\log n)$
approximation ratio for this problem and it is NP-hard beat a $O(\log n)$
approximation, settling the complexity of the problem.
  However, for Uniform Decision Tree, i.e. Decision Tree with uniform weights,
the story is more subtle. The greedy algorithm's $O(\log n)$ approximation
ratio was the best known, but the largest approximation ratio known to be
NP-hard is $4-\varepsilon$. We prove that the greedy algorithm gives a
$O(\frac{\log n}{\log C_{OPT}})$ approximation for Uniform Decision Tree, where
$C_{OPT}$ is the cost of the optimal tree and show this is best possible for
the greedy algorithm. As a corollary, we resolve a conjecture of Kosaraju,
Przytycka, and Borgstrom. Leveraging this result, for all $\alpha\in(0,1)$, we
exhibit a $\frac{9.01}{\alpha}$ approximation algorithm to Uniform Decision
Tree running in subexponential time $2^{\tilde O(n^\alpha)}$. As a corollary,
achieving any super-constant approximation ratio on Uniform Decision Tree is
not NP-hard, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis. This work therefore adds
approximating Uniform Decision Tree to a small list of natural problems that
have subexponential time algorithms but no known polynomial time algorithms.
All our results hold for Decision Tree with weights not too far from uniform. A
key technical contribution of our work is showing a connection between greedy
algorithms for Uniform Decision Tree and for Min Sum Set Cover.

form in the ice mantle of dust grains and are subsequently returned into the
gas due to grain heating by intense radiation of protostars. Previous research
on the desorption of molecules from the ice mantle assumed that grains are at
rest which is contrary to the fact that grains are suprathermally rotating as a
result of their interaction with an anisotropic radiation or gas flow. {To
clearly understand how molecules are released in to the gas phase, the effect
of grain suprathermal rotation on surface chemistry must be quantified}. In
this paper, we study the effect of suprathermal rotation of dust grains spun-up
by radiative torques on the desorption of molecules from icy grain mantles
around protostars. We show that centrifugal potential energy due to grain
rotation reduces the potential barrier of molecules and significantly enhances
their desorption rate. We term this mechanism {\it rotational-thermal} or {\it
ro-thermal} desorption. We apply the ro-thermal mechanism for studying the
desorption of molecules from icy grains which are simultaneously heated to high
temperatures and spun-up to suprathermal rotation by an intense radiation of
protostars. We find that ro-thermal desorption is much more efficient than
thermal desorption for molecules with high binding energy such as water and
COMs. Our results have important implications for understanding the origin of
COMs detected in star-forming regions and call for attention to the effect of
suprathermal rotation of icy grains to use molecules as a tracer of physical
conditions of star-forming regions.

using the Dark Energy Survey (DES): $\sim$11,800 optically selected RM-Y3 and
$\sim$1,000 X-ray selected MARD-Y3 clusters. We show that cluster radio loud
AGN are highly concentrated around cluster centers to $z\sim1$. We measure the
halo occupation number for cluster radio AGN above a threshold luminosity,
finding that the number of radio AGN per cluster increases with cluster halo
mass as $N\propto M^{1.2\pm0.1}$ ($N\propto M^{0.68\pm0.34}$) for the RM-Y3
(MARD-Y3) sample. Together, these results indicate that radio mode feedback is
favoured in more massive galaxy clusters. Using optical counterparts for these
sources, we demonstrate weak redshift evolution in the host broad band colors
and the radio luminosity at fixed host galaxy stellar mass. We use the redshift
evolution in radio luminosity to break the degeneracy between density and
luminosity evolution scenarios in the redshift trend of the radio AGN
luminosity function (LF). The LF exhibits a redshift trend of the form
$(1+z)^\gamma$ in density and luminosity, respectively, of $\gamma_{\rm

$\gamma_{\rm D}=2.6\pm0.7$ and $\gamma_{\rm P}=0.31\pm0.15$ in MARD-Y3. We
discuss the physical drivers of radio mode feedback in cluster AGN, and we use
the cluster radio galaxy LF to estimate the average radio-mode feedback energy
as a function of cluster mass and redshift and compare it to the core

free of errors. In practice, however, they contain errors despite all efforts
to minimise them. These errors then propagate up to the accuracy assessment
stage and impact the validation results. For photo-interpreted reference data,
the three most widely studied sources of error are systematic incorrect
labelling, vigilance drops, and demographic factors. How internal estimation
errors, i.e., errors intrinsic to the response design, affect the accuracy of
reference data is far less understood. We analysed the impact of estimation
errors for two types of legends as well as for point-based and partition-based
response designs with a range of sub-sample sizes. We showed that the accuracy
of response designs depends on the class proportions within the sampling units,
with complex landscapes being more prone to errors. As a result, response
designs where the number of sub-samples are fixed are inefficient, and the
labels of reference data sets have inconsistent confidence levels. To control
estimation errors, to guarantee high accuracy standards of validation data, and
to minimise data collection efforts, we proposed to rely on confidence
intervals of the photo-interpreted data to define how many sub-samples should
be labelled. In practice, sub-samples are iteratively selected and labelled
until the estimated class proportions reach the desired level of confidence. As
a result, less effort is spent on labelling obvious cases and the spared effort
can be allocated to more complex cases. This approach could reduce the
labelling effort by 50% to 75% in our study site, with greater gains in
homogeneous landscapes. We contend that adopting this optimisation approach
will not only increase the efficiency of reference data collection but will
also help deliver reliable accuracy estimates to the user community.

e-e interactions on energy-relaxation is largest in metals with strong e-p

vitro on sciatic nerve of Sprague-Dawley rats. Design of the RLC circuit was
performed in electrical circuit modelling software, aided by in vitro impedance
measurements on nerve and nerve cuff in the range 5 Hz to 50 kHz. Main results:
The frequency range 17 +/- 1 kHz was selected for the RLC experiment. The RLC
experiment was performed on four subjects using an RLC circuit designed to
produce a resonant frequency of 17 kHz with a bandwidth of 3.6 kHz, and
containing a 22 mH inductive element and a 3.45 nF capacitive element. With the
RLC circuit connected, relative increases in the impedance signal (+/- 3sig
noise) of 44 % (+/-15 %), 33 % (+/-30 %), 37 % (+/-8.6 %), and 16 % (+/-19 %)
were produced. Significance: The increase in impedance signal amplitude at high
frequencies, generated by the novel implementation of a parallel RLC circuit
across the drive current, improves spatial resolution by increasing the number
of parallel drive currents which can be implemented in a frequency division
multiplexed (FDM) EIT system, and aids the long term goal of a real-time FDM

where large regular exomoons escape after tidal-interchange of angular momentum
with its parent planet, becoming small planets by themselves. We name this
hypothetical type of object a \textit{ploonet}. By performing semi-analytical
simulations of tidal interactions between a large moon with a close-in giant,
and integrating numerically their orbits for several Myr, we found that in
$\sim$50 per cent of the cases a young ploonet may survive ejection from the
planetary system, or collision with its parent planet and host star, being in
principle detectable. Volatile-rich ploonets are dramatically affected by
stellar radiation during both planetocentric and siderocentric orbital
evolution, and their radius and mass change significantly due to the
sublimation of most of their material during time-scales of hundred of Myr. We
estimate the photometric signatures that ploonets may produce if they transit
the star during the phase of evaporation, and compare them with noisy
lightcurves of known objects (""Kronian"" stars and non-periodical dips in dusty
lightcurves). Additionally, the typical transit timing variations (TTV) induced

brightest GBM bursts, and the high-energy emission shows delayed onset as well

several GRBs with durations over 10 ks. Furthermore, the larger number of LAT

\cite{Clevenson2015,Wolf2015,Barry2016,Chatzidrosos2017}. Here we investigate
the irradiation and annealing process applied to 28 diamond samples using a new
ambient-temperature, all-optical approach. As the presence of the
neutrally-charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV$^\text{0}$) center is deleterious to
sensor performance, this photoluminescence decomposition analysis (PDA) is
first employed to determine the concentration ratio of NV$^\text{-}$ to NV$^0$
in diamond samples from the measured photoluminescence spectrum. The analysis
hinges on (i) isolating each NV charge state's emission spectrum and (ii)
measuring the NV$^\text{-}$ to NV$^0$ emission ratio, which is found to be
2.5$\pm$0.5 under low-intensity 532 nm illumination. Using the PDA method, we
measure the effects of irradiation and annealing on conversion of
substitutional nitrogen to NV centers. Combining these measurements with a
phenomenological model for diamond irradiation and annealing, we extract an
estimated monovacancy creation rate of $0.52\pm 0.26$ cm$^{\text{-1}}$ for 1
MeV electron irradiation and an estimated monovacancy diffusion coefficient of
1.8 nm$^2$/s at 850~$^\circ$C. Finally we find that irradiation doses $\gtrsim

  interferogram analysis",,,,,"eess.IV physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Complex object wave recovery from single-shot interference pattern is an
important practical problem in interferometry and digital holography. The most
popular single-shot interferogram analysis method involves Fourier filtering of
cross-term but this method suffers from poor resolution. For obtaining full
pixel resolution, it is necessary to model the object wave recovery as an
optimization problem. The optimization approach typically involves minimizing a
cost function consisting of a data consistency term and one or more constraint
terms. Despite its potential performance advantages, this method is not used
widely due to several tedious and difficult tasks such as empirical tuning of
free parameters. We introduce a new optimization approach Mean gradient descent
(MGD) for single-shot interferogram analysis that is simple to implement,
robust and does not require any free parameters. The MGD iteration does not try
to achieve minimization of any cost function but instead aims to reach a
solution point where the data consistency and the constraint terms balance each
other. This is achieved by iteratively progressing the solution in the
direction that bisects the descent directions associated with the error and
constraint terms. Numerical illustrations are shown for recovery of a step
phase object from its corresponding off-axis as well as on-axis interferograms
simulated with multiple noise levels. Our results show full pixel resolution as
evident from the recovery of phase step and excellent rms phase accuracy
relative to the ground truth phase map. The concept of MGD as presented here
can potentially find applications to wider class of optimization problems.

applications, because of the flexibility and effectiveness in modeling
uncertainties without prior information. However, the existing evidence theory
is insufficient to consider the situations where it has no capability to
express the fluctuations of data at a given phase of time during their
execution, and the uncertainty and imprecision which are inevitably involved in
the data occur concurrently with changes to the phase or periodicity of the
data. In this paper, therefore, a generalized Dempster-Shafer evidence theory
is proposed. To be specific, a mass function in the generalized Dempster-Shafer
evidence theory is modeled by a complex number, called as a complex basic
belief assignment, which has more powerful ability to express uncertain
information. Based on that, a generalized Dempster's combination rule is
exploited. In contrast to the classical Dempster's combination rule, the
condition in terms of the conflict coefficient between the evidences K<1 is
released in the generalized Dempster's combination rule. Hence, it is more
general and applicable than the classical Dempster's combination rule. When the
complex mass function is degenerated from complex numbers to real numbers, the
generalized Dempster's combination rule degenerates to the classical evidence
theory under the condition that the conflict coefficient between the evidences
K is less than 1. In a word, this generalized Dempster-Shafer evidence theory
provides a promising way to model and handle more uncertain information.

results from interactions of quarks, under the approximate chiral symmetry
restoration, with metastable local domains of gluon fields of non-zero
topological charges out of QCD vacuum fluctuations. Those local domains violate
the $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{CP}$ invariance, potentially offering a
solution to the strong $\mathcal{CP}$ problem in explaining the magnitude of
the matter-antimatter asymmetry in today's universe. Relativistic heavy-ion
collisions, with the likely creation of the high energy density quark-gluon
plasma and restoration of the approximate chiral symmetry, and the possibly
long-lived strong magnetic field, provide a unique opportunity to detect the
CME. Early measurements of the CME-induced charge separation in heavy-ion
collisions are dominated by physics backgrounds. Major efforts have been
devoted to eliminate or reduce those backgrounds. We review those efforts, with
a somewhat historical perspective, and focus on the recent innovative
experimental undertakings in the search for the CME in heavy-ion collisions.

view plays a critical role in how much of the environment a downward facing
camera can perceive at any one time. Furthermore, in other applications, such
as on roads or in indoor environments, additional factors such as camera
resolution and sensor placement altitude can also affect this coverage. The
sensor coverage and the subsequent processing of its data also has significant
computational implications. In this paper we present for the first time a set

visual localization performance, enabling the identification of the minimum
visual sensor coverage required to obtain optimal localization performance with
minimal compute. We develop a localization performance indicator based on the
overlapping coefficient, and demonstrate its predictive power for localization
performance with a certain sensor coverage. We evaluate our method on several

superconductivity by doping the topological insulator Bi2Se3, we find that
there exist highly anisotropic phonons, with the linewidths of the acoustic
phonons increasing substantially at long wavelengths, but only for those along
the [001] direction. This observation indicates a large and singular
electron-phonon coupling at small momenta, which we propose to give rise to the
exotic p-wave nematic superconducting pairing in the MxBi2Se3 (M = Cu, Sr, Nb)
superconductor family. Therefore, we show these superconductors to be example
systems where electron-phonon interaction can induce more exotic
superconducting pairing than the s-wave, consistent with the topological
superconductivity.

Along with the success of deep convolutional neural networks, semantic
segmentation has made great achievements and improvements, in terms of both
urban scene parsing and indoor semantic segmentation. However, most of the
state-of-the-art models are still faced with a challenge in discriminative
feature learning, which limits the ability of a model to detect multi-scale
objects and to guarantee semantic consistency inside one object or distinguish
different adjacent objects with similar appearance. In this paper, a practical
and efficient edge-aware neural network is presented for semantic segmentation.
This end-to-end trainable engine consists of a new encoder-decoder network, a
large kernel spatial pyramid pooling (LKPP) block, and an edge-aware loss
function. The encoder-decoder network was designed as a balanced structure to
narrow the semantic and resolution gaps in multi-level feature aggregation,
while the LKPP block was constructed with a densely expanding receptive field
for multi-scale feature extraction and fusion. Furthermore, the new powerful
edge-aware loss function is proposed to refine the boundaries directly from the
semantic segmentation prediction for more robust and discriminative features.
The effectiveness of the proposed model was demonstrated using Cityscapes,
CamVid, and NYUDv2 benchmark datasets. The performance of the two structures
and the edge-aware loss function in ELKPPNet was validated on the Cityscapes
dataset, while the complete ELKPPNet was evaluated on the CamVid and NYUDv2
datasets. A comparative analysis with the state-of-the-art methods under the

There are several concerns that make security difficult to deal with; for
instance, (1) when stakeholders discuss general requirements in (review)
meetings, they are often not aware that they should also discuss
security-related topics, and (2) they typically do not have enough security
expertise. These concerns become even more challenging in agile development
contexts, where lightweight documentation is typically involved. The goal of
this paper is to design and evaluate an approach to support reviewing
security-related aspects in agile requirements specifications of web
applications. The designed approach considers user stories and security
specifications as input and relates those user stories to security properties
via Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Based on the related security
properties, our approach then identifies high-level security requirements from
the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) to be verified and generates
a focused reading techniques to support reviewers in detecting detects. We
evaluate our approach via two controlled experiment trials, comparing the
effectiveness and efficiency of novice inspectors verifying security aspects in
agile requirements using our reading technique against using the complete list
of OWASP high-level security requirements. The (statistically significant)
results indicate that using the reading technique has a positive impact (with
very large effect size) on the performance of inspectors in terms of

dense 3D point cloud of each scene by using stereo sequences, and then obtains
3D geometric constraints including 3D optical flow and 6-DoF pose as

accuracy to dynamic objects and textureless environments. In DeepVIO training,
2D optical flow network is constrained by the projection of its corresponding

for second-order elliptic partial differential equations in non-divergence
form. Unlike the classical finite element method which uses weak formulations
of PDEs not applicable for the non-divergence equation, the first-order
least-squares formulations naturally have stable weak forms without using
integration by parts, allow simple finite element approximation spaces, and
have build-in a posteriori error estimators for adaptive mesh refinements.
  The non-divergence equation is first written as a system of first-order
equations by introducing the gradient as a new variable. Then two versions of
least-squares finite element methods using simple $C^0$ finite elements are
developed in the paper, one is the $L^2$-LSFEM which uses linear elements, the
other is the weighted-LSFEM with a mesh-dependent weight to ensure the optimal
convergence. Under a very mild assumption that the PDE has a unique solution,
optimal a priori and a posteriori error estimates are proved. With an extra
assumption on the operator regularity which is weaker than traditionally
assumed, convergences in standard norms for the weighted-LSFEM are also
discussed. $L^2$-error estimates are derived for both formulations. We perform
extensive numerical experiments for smooth, non-smooth, and even degenerate
coefficients on smooth and singular solutions to test the accuracy and
efficiency of the proposed methods.

complementary geometric cues. However, due to the inaccessibility of depth
sensors, depth information is usually unavailable for the test images. In this
paper, we leverage only the depth of training images as the privileged

loss weight map by employing two depth-related measurements of hard pixels:
Depth Prediction Error and Depthaware Segmentation Error. The loss weight map
is then applied to segmentation loss, with the goal of learning a more robust

  We investigate the geometric structure of the associated stable and unstable

single connecting orbit of codimension one and an entire cylinder of
structurally stable connecting orbits between two saddle periodic orbits. We
employ a boundary-value problem set-up to compute their stable and unstable

intersection sets with a suitable three-dimensional Poincar\'e section. We show
that, locally near the intersection set of the heterodimensional cycle, the

which is due to the fact that it is not possible to find a Poincar\'e section

DC$_3$N ($J=9-8$). We detected a dense molecular clump that contains FIR 4/5.
We also detected in $^{13}$CO blueshifted and redshifted components driven
presumably by protostellar outflows in this region. The axes of the FIR 3 and
VLA 13 outflows, projected on the plane of the sky, appear to point toward the
FIR 4 clump, suggesting that the clump may be compressed by protostellar
outflows from Class I sources, FIR 3 and VLA 13. Applying the hyperfine fit of
N$_2$H$^+$ lines, we estimated the excitation temperature to be $\sim$ 20 K.
The high excitation temperature is consistent with the fact that the clump
contains protostars. The CCS emission was detected in this region for the first
time. Its abundance is estimated to be a few $\times 10^{-12}$, indicating that
the region is chemically evolved at $\sim 10^5$ years, which is comparable to
the typical lifetime of the Class I protostars. This timescale is consistent
with the scenario that star formation in FIR 4 is triggered by dynamical
compression of the protostellar outflows. The [HNC]/[HCN] ratio is evaluated to
be $\sim 0.5$ in the dense clump and the outflow lobes, whereas it is somewhat
larger in the envelope of the dense clump. The small [HNC]/[HCN] ratio
indicates that the HNC formation was prevented due to high temperatures. Such
high temperatures seem to be consistent with the scenario that either
protostellar radiation or outflow compression, or both, affected the thermal
properties of this region.

targets multi-domain word segmentation and provides separate models for
different domains, such as web, medicine, and tourism. Besides, due to the lack
of labeled data in many domains, we propose a domain adaptation paradigm to
introduce cross-domain semantic knowledge via a translation system. Through
this method, we generate synthetic data using a large amount of unlabeled data
in the target domain and then obtain a word segmentation model for the target
domain. We also further refine the performance of the default model with the
help of synthetic data. Experiments show that PKUSEG achieves high performance
on multiple domains. The new toolkit also supports POS tagging and model
training to adapt to various application scenarios. The toolkit is now freely

messages, leaving programmers confused and requiring them to spend precious
time to resolve the underlying error. To find help, programmers often take to
online question-and-answer forums such as Stack Overflow to start discussion
threads about the errors they encountered.
  Aims: We conjecture that information from Stack Overflow threads which
discuss compiler errors can be automatically collected and repackaged to
provide programmers with enhanced compiler error messages, thus saving
programmers' time and energy.
  Method: We present Pycee, a plugin integrated with the popular Sublime Text
IDE to provide enhanced compiler error messages for the Python programming
language. Pycee automatically queries Stack Overflow to provide customised and
summarised information within the IDE. We evaluated two Pycee variants through
a think-aloud user study during which 16 programmers completed Python
programming tasks while using Pycee.
  Results: The majority of participants agreed that Pycee was helpful while
completing the study tasks. When compared to a baseline relying on the official
Python documentation to enhance compiler error messages, participants generally
preferred Pycee in terms of helpfulness, citing concrete suggestions for fixes
and example code as major benefits.
  Conclusions: Our results confirm that data from online sources such as Stack
Overflow can be successfully used to automatically enhance compiler error
messages. Our work opens up venues for future work to further enhance compiler
error messages as well as to automatically reuse content from Stack Overflow
for other aspects of programming.

apply a recent region based convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for the
automatic detection of polyps in images and videos obtained from colonoscopy
examinations. We use a deep-CNN model (Inception Resnet) as a transfer learning
scheme in the detection system. To overcome the polyp detection obstacles and
the small number of polyp images, we examine image augmentation strategies for
training deep networks. We further propose two efficient post-learning methods
such as, automatic false positive learning and off-line learning, both of which
can be incorporated with the region based detection system for reliable polyp
detection. Using the large size of colonoscopy databases, experimental results
demonstrate that the suggested detection systems show better performance
compared to other systems in the literature. Furthermore, we show improved
detection performance using the proposed post-learning schemes for colonoscopy
videos.

Maccarone et al. (2019) as having being induced by an accretion event on a
massive white dwarf, resembling a dwarf nova super-outburst. These authors
argued that the supersoft X-ray spectrum had a different origin than in an
atmosphere heated by shell nuclear burning, because no mass was ejected. We
find instead that the event's timescale and other characteristics are typical
of non-mass ejecting thermonuclear runaways, as already predicted by Shara et
al. (1977) and the extensive grid of nova models by Yaron et al. (2005). We
suggest that the low X-ray and bolometric luminosity in comparison to the
predictions of the models of nuclear burning are due to an optically thick
accretion disk, hiding most of the white dwarf surface. If this is the case, we
calculated that the optical transient can be explained as a non-ejective
thermonuclear event on a WD of $\simeq$1.1M$_\odot$ accreting at the rate of
$\simeq3.5{-}5{\times}10^{-7}$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. We make predictions that
should prove whether the nature of the transient event was due to thermonuclear
burning or to accretion; observational proof should be obtained in the next few
years, because a new outburst should occur within $\simeq$10-15 years of the
event.

the lack of labeled polyp training images. In this paper, we propose a

form of polyp mask which represents only the polyp position as an input
conditioned image, realistic polyp image generation is a difficult task in a
generative adversarial networks approach. We propose an edge filtering-based
combined input conditioned image to train our proposed networks. This enables
realistic polyp image generations while maintaining the original structures of
the colonoscopy image frames. More importantly, our proposed framework
generates synthetic polyp images from normal colonoscopy images which have the
advantage of being relatively easy to obtain. The network architecture is based
on the use of multiple dilated convolutions in each encoding part of our
generator network to consider large receptive fields and avoid many
contractions of a feature map size. An image resizing with convolution for
upsampling in the decoding layers is considered to prevent artifacts on
generated images. We show that the generated polyp images are not only
qualitatively realistic but also help to improve polyp detection performance.

defining the acquisition function as a learning predictor and training it by
reinforcement feedback collected from each labeling round. As active learning
is a scarce data regime, we bootstrap from a well-known heuristic that filters
the bulk of data points on which all heuristics would agree, and learn a policy
to warp the top portion of this ranking in the most beneficial way for the
character of a specific data distribution. Our system consists of a Bayesian
neural net, the predictor, a bootstrap acquisition function, a probabilistic
state definition, and another Bayesian policy network that can effectively
incorporate this input distribution. We observe on three benchmark data sets

levels of NH by Ar for energies up to 3000 cm-1 . After thermal average of the

Nevertheless, traditional change detection methods can neither take full
advantage of spatial context information nor cope with the complex internal
heterogeneity of VHR images. In this paper, a powerful feature extraction model
entitled multi-scale feature convolution unit (MFCU) is adopted for change
detection in multi-temporal VHR images. MFCU can extract multi-scale
spatial-spectral features in the same layer. Based on the unit two novel deep
siamese convolutional neural networks, called as deep siamese multi-scale
convolutional network (DSMS-CN) and deep siamese multi-scale fully
convolutional network (DSMS-FCN), are designed for unsupervised and supervised
change detection, respectively. For unsupervised change detection, an automatic
pre-classification is implemented to obtain reliable training samples, then
DSMS-CN fits the statistical distribution of changed and unchanged areas from
selected training samples through MFCU modules and deep siamese architecture.
For supervised change detection, the end-to-end deep fully convolutional
network DSMS-FCN is trained in any size of multi-temporal VHR images, and
directly outputs the binary change map. In addition, for the purpose of solving
the inaccurate localization problem, the fully connected conditional random

Neural Network-based segmentation using two U-net architectures. The first
U-net refines the result of NMAR and the muscle segmentation is performed by
the second U-net. We conducted experiments using simulated images of 20
patients and real images of three patients to evaluate the segmentation
accuracy of 19 muscles. In simulation study, the proposed method showed
statistically significant improvement (p<0.05) in the average symmetric surface

all muscles from 1.17 +/- 0.543 mm (mean +/- std over all patients) to 1.10 +/-

often use Document Preparation Systems (DPS) to write and Computer Algebra

the expressions manually between DPS and CAS. This process is time-consuming

Maple and Mathematica as the CAS, and LaTeX as our DPS.
  Design/methodology/approach: Bruce Miller at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) developed a collection of special LaTeX macros
that create links from mathematical symbols to their definitions in the NIST
Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF). We are using these macros to
perform rule-based translations between the formulae in the DLMF and CAS.
Moreover, we develop software to ease the creation of new rules and to discover
inconsistencies.
  Findings: We created 396 mappings and translated 58.8% of DLMF formulae
(2,405 expressions) successfully between Maple and DLMF. For a significant
percentage, the special function definitions in Maple and the DLMF were
different. Therefore, an atomic symbol in one system maps to a composite
expression in the other system. The translator was also successfully used for
automatic verification of mathematical online compendia and CAS. Our evaluation
techniques discovered two errors in the DLMF and one defect in Maple.
  Originality: This paper introduces the first translation tool for special
functions between LaTeX and CAS. The approach improves error-prone manual
translations and can be used to verify mathematical online compendia and CAS.

450,646 stars with RVs measured by both surveys and 27,716 of them turn out to

sub-structures which are mostly ring-like. One interpretation is that these
rings are caused by growing planets. These potential planets are not yet
opening very deep gaps in their discs. These planets instead form small gaps in
the discs to generate small pressure bumps exterior to their orbits that stop
the inflow of the largest dust particles. In the pebble accretion paradigm,
this planetary mass corresponds to the pebble isolation mass, where pebble
accretion stops and efficient gas accretion starts. We perform planet
population synthesis via pebble and gas accretion including type-I and type-II
migration. In the first stage of our simulations, we investigate the conditions
necessary for planets to reach the pebble isolation mass and compare their
position to the observed gaps. We find that in order to match the gap
structures 2000 M E in pebbles is needed, which would be only available for the
most metal rich stars. We then follow the evolution of these planets for a few
My to compare the resulting population with the observed exoplanet populations.
Planet formation in discs with these large amounts of pebbles result in mostly
forming gas giants and only very little super-Earths, contradicting
observations. This leads to the conclusions that either (i) the observed discs
are exceptions, (ii) not all gaps in observed discs are caused by planets or
(iii) that we miss some important ingredients in planet formation related to
gas accretion and/or planet migration.

for a qubit where the only control variable is the longitudinal $z$-field,
while the transverse $x$-field remains constant. This restrictive framework is
pertinent to some important tasks in quantum computing, for example the design
of a high fidelity controlled-phase gate can be mapped to the adiabatic quantum
control of such a qubit. We study this problem in the adiabatic reference frame
and with appropriately rescaled time, using as control input the derivative of
the total field polar angle (with respect to rescaled time). We first show that
a constant pulse can achieve perfect adiabatic rapid passage at only specific
times, corresponding to resonant shortcuts to adiabaticity. We next show that,
by using ""on-off-on-...-on-off-on"" pulse-sequences with appropriate
characteristics (amplitude, timing, and number of pulses), a perfect fidelity
can be obtained for every duration larger than the limit $\pi/\Omega$, where
$\Omega$ is the constant transverse $x$-field. We provide equations from which
these characteristics can be calculated. The proposed methodology for
generalized resonant shortcuts exploits the advantages of composite pulses in
the rescaled time, while the corresponding control $z$-field varies
continuously and monotonically in the original time. Of course, as the total
duration approaches the lower limit, the changes in the control signal become
more abrupt. These results are not restricted only to quantum information
processing applications, but is also expected to impact other areas, where
adiabatic rapid passage is used.

remnant. The composition of such winds is crucial in the understanding of the
electromagnetic emission in the recently observed macronova following GW170817.
Compared to the original version, we introduce an optical-depth-dependent flux
factor to model the average angle of neutrino propagation, and a modulation
that accounts for flux anisotropies in non-spherical geometries. We scrutinise
our approach by first comparing the new scheme against the original one for a
spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova snapshot, both in 1D and in 3D,
and additionally against a two-moment (M1) scheme as implemented in 1D into the
code GR1D. The luminosities and mean energies agree to a few percents in most
tests. Finally, for the case of a binary merger remnant snapshot we compare the
new ASL scheme with the M1 scheme that is implemented in the Eulerian adaptive
mesh refinement code FLASH. We find that the neutrino absorption distribution
in the semi-transparent regime is overall well reproduced. Both approaches
agree to within $\lesssim 15\%$ for the average energies and to better than
$\sim 35 \%$ in the total luminosities.

standards since the first proposals to carry out precision spectroscopy on

uncertainty of today's leading optical standards is currently in the $10^{-18}$
range, approximately two orders of magnitude better than that of the best
caesium primary frequency standards. This exceptional accuracy and stability is
resulting in a growing number of research groups developing optical clocks.
While good review papers covering the topic already exist, more practical
guidelines are needed as a complement. The purpose of this document is
therefore to provide technical guidance for researchers starting in the field
of optical clocks. The target audience includes national metrology institutes
(NMIs) wanting to set up optical clocks (or subsystems thereof) and PhD
students and postdocs entering the field. Another potential audience is
academic groups with experience in atomic physics and atom or ion trapping, but
with less experience of time and frequency metrology and optical clock
requirements. These guidelines have arisen from the scope of the EMPIR project
""Optical clocks with $1 \times 10^{-18}$ uncertainty"" (OC18). Therefore, the
examples are from European laboratories even though similar work is carried out
all over the world. The goal of OC18 was to push the development of optical
clocks by improving each of the necessary subsystems: ultrastable lasers,
neutral-atom and single-ion traps, and interrogation techniques. This document
shares the knowledge acquired by the OC18 project consortium and gives
practical guidance on each of these aspects.

frequently report an unusually low total-to-selective extinction ratio ($R_{\rm
V} < 2$) and small peak wavelength of polarization ($\lambda_{\rm max}< 0.4 \mu
m$). Recently, Hoang et al. proposed that the increase in the abundance of
small grains relative to large grains near SNe Ia due to RAdiative Torque
Disruption (RATD) can explain this puzzle. To test this scenario, we will
perform detailed modeling of dust extinction and polarization of SNe Ia
accounting for grain disruption by RATD and grain alignment by RAdiative
Torques (RATs). For dust clouds at distance $d< 4$ pc from the source, we find
that $R_{\rm V}$ decreases rapidly from the standard value of $3.1$ to $\sim
1.5$ after a disruption time $t_{\rm disr}\le 40$ days. We then calculate the
observed SNe Ia light curve and find that the colors of SNe Ia would change
with time due to time-varying extinction for dust clouds at distance of $d<4$
pc. We also calculate the wavelength-dependence polarization produced by grains
aligned with the magnetic fields by RATs. We find that $ \lambda_{\rm max}$
decreases rapidly from $\sim 0.55 \mu$m to $\sim 0.15 \mu$m over an alignment
time of $t_{\rm align}< 10$ days due to the enhanced alignment of small grains.
By fitting the theoretical polarization curve with the Serkowski law, we find
that the parameter $K$ from the Serkowski law increases when large grains are
disrupted by RATD which can explain the $K$ vs. $\lambda_{\rm max}$ data
observed for SNe Ia. Finally, we discover an anti-correlation between $K$ and
$R_{\rm V}$ which might already be supported by SNe Ia observational data. Our
results demonstrate the important effect of rotational disruption of dust
grains by radiative torques on the time-dependent extinction, polarization, and
colors of SNe Ia.

have recently been experimentally investigated as thermoelectric materials
owing to their low thermal conductivity and high controllability of constituent
elements. However, thermoelectric performance of LaOBiPbS$_3$ is at present not
very high and that of its analogous compounds remains to be unknown. In this
study, we theoretically investigate thermoelectric properties of 24 possible
variations of the constituent elements in LaOBiPbS$_3$ from the viewpoint of
the electronic structure. We find that some compounds can have much better
thermoelectric performance than LaOBiPbS$_3$; in particular, LaOSbPbSe$_3$ is
predicted to have a power factor five times as large as that of LaOBiPbS$_3$.
Here, the choice of the pnictogen atom (As, Sb, and Bi), of which the
low-energy conduction bands mainly consist, correlates with the calculated
power factor and the dimensionless figure of merit, $ZT$. Such correlation
comes from the fact that the low-dimensionality of the electronic structure,
which enhances the density of states near the band edge, strongly depends on
the pnictogen atom through, e.g., the strength of the spin-orbit coupling.
Moreover, hybridization of the wave functions in the pnictogen-dichalcogenide
layer and those in the rock-salt layer plays a key role in gap opening, and
thus is important for achieving high thermoelectric performance. In
LaOSbPbSe$_3$, such hybridization also pushes up the conduction band bottom,
which enhances the density of states near the band edge and thus the power

public or trusted sinks. Existing mechanisms cover a wide array of options,
ranging from lightweight taint analysis to heavyweight information flow control
that also considers implicit flows. Dynamic analysis, which is particularly
popular for languages such as JavaScript, faces the question whether to invest
in analyzing flows caused by not executing a particular branch, so-called
hidden implicit flows. This paper addresses the questions how common different
kinds of flows are in real-world programs, how important these flows are to
enforce security policies, and how costly it is to consider these flows. We
address these questions in an empirical study that analyzes 56 real-world
JavaScript programs that suffer from various security problems, such as code
injection vulnerabilities, denial of service vulnerabilities, memory leaks, and
privacy leaks. The study is based on a state-of-the-art dynamic information
flow analysis and a formalization of its core. We find that implicit flows are
expensive to track in terms of permissiveness, label creep, and runtime
overhead. We find a lightweight taint analysis to be sufficient for most of the
studied security problems, while for some privacy-related code, observable
tracking is sometimes required. In contrast, we do not find any evidence that
tracking hidden implicit flows reveals otherwise missed security problems. Our
results help security analysts and analysis designers to understand the
cost-benefit tradeoffs of information flow analysis and provide empirical
evidence that analyzing implicit flows in a cost-effective way is a relevant
problem.

$|\psi,0\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[|L\rangle+|R\rangle]$ when the Hamiltonian
$\hat H$ is set equal to 0, and when $\hat H$ is the free field Hamiltonian.
Here $|L\rangle, |R\rangle$ are coherent states which represent clumps of
particles, with mean particle number density $N\chi_{i}^{2}(x)$, where
$\chi_{1}(x),\chi_{1}(x) $ are gaussians of width $\sigma>>m^{-1}$ with mean
positions separated by distance $>>\sigma$. It is shown that, with high
probability, the solution for $\hat H=0$ (identical to the short time solution
for $\hat H\neq 0$) favors collapse toward eigenstates of the scalar field
whose eigenvalues are close to $\sim\chi_{i}(x)$. Thus, this collapse dynamics
results in essentially one clump of particles. However, eventually particle
production dominates the density matrix since, as is well known, the collapse
generates energy/sec-volume of every particle momentum in equal amounts.
Because of the particle production, this is not an experimentally viable
physical theory but, as is emphasized by the discussion, it is a sound
relativistic collapse model, with sensible collapse behavior.

adaptation transform. It has been found that adaptation methods using
discriminative objective functions - such as cross-entropy loss - often require
careful regularisation to avoid over-fitting to errors in the one-best
transcriptions. In this paper we solve this problem by performing
discriminative adaptation using lattices obtained from a first pass decoding,
an approach that can be readily integrated into the lattice-free maximum mutual
information (LF-MMI) framework. We investigate this approach on three
transcription tasks of varying difficulty: TED talks, multi-genre broadcast

enables many more parameters to be adapted without over-fitting being observed,

50%.

[PODC 2017] showed that there is an algorithm in the CONGEST model that finds a
$\Delta$-approximation for $\MaxIS$ in $O(\MIS(n,\Delta)\log W)$ rounds, where
$W$ is the maximum weight of a node in the graph, which can be as high as
$\poly (n)$. Whether their algorithm is deterministic or randomized depends on
the $\MIS$ algorithm that is used as a black-box.
  Our main result in this work is a randomized $(\poly(\log\log

$(1+\epsilon)\Delta$-approximation for $\MaxIS$ in the CONGEST model. That is,
by sacrificing only a tiny fraction of the approximation guarantee, we achieve
an \emph{exponential} speed-up in the running time over the previous best known

given by Kuhn, Moscibroda and Wattenhofer [JACM, 2016] on the number of rounds
for any (possibly randomized) algorithm that finds a maximal independent set

knowledge, in this case, the most appropriate solution for pooled steganalysis
is to use a Single-Image Detector (SID) to estimate/quantify if an image is

obtaining steganalysis efficiencies comparable to those obtained by a

an integral aspect of obtaining the state-of-the-art performance for any model.
Most often, hyperparameters are optimized just by training a model on a grid of
possible hyperparameter values and taking the one that performs best on a
validation sample (grid search). More recently, methods have been introduced
that build a so-called surrogate model that predicts the validation loss for a
specific hyperparameter setting, model and dataset and then sequentially select
the next hyperparameter to test, based on a heuristic function of the expected
value and the uncertainty of the surrogate model called acquisition function
(sequential model-based Bayesian optimization, SMBO).
  In this paper we model the hyperparameter optimization problem as a
sequential decision problem, which hyperparameter to test next, and address it
with reinforcement learning. This way our model does not have to rely on a
heuristic acquisition function like SMBO, but can learn which hyperparameters
to test next based on the subsequent reduction in validation loss they will
eventually lead to, either because they yield good models themselves or because
they allow the hyperparameter selection policy to build a better surrogate
model that is able to choose better hyperparameters later on. Experiments on a
large battery of 50 data sets demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches for hyperparameter learning.

single-crystalline Nb(100) samples were investigated in and ex-situ during
annealing in UHV as well as in nitrogen atmospheres with temperatures and
pressures similar to the ones employed in real Nb cavity treatments. Annealing
of Nb specimens up to 800{\deg}C in vacuum promotes partial reduction of the
natural surface oxides (Nb2O5, NbO2, NbO) into NbO. Upon cooling to 120{\deg}C,
no evidence of nitrogen-rich layers was detected after nitrogen exposure times
of up to 48 hours. Oxygen enrichment below the Nb/oxide interface and posterior
diffusion of oxygen species towards the Nb matrix, along with a partial
reduction of the natural surface oxides was observed upon a stepwise annealing
up to 250{\deg}C. Nitrogen introduction to the system at 250{\deg}C neither
promotes N diffusion into the Nb matrix nor the formation of new surface
layers. Upon further heating to 500{\deg}C in a nitrogen atmosphere, the growth
of a new subsurface Nb$_x$N$_y$ layer was detected. These results shed light on
the composition of the near-surface region of Nb after low-temperature nitrogen

abounds in the technological and natural world around us, ranging from
squealing car brake pads to earthquakes along geological faults. A general
framework for understanding and interpreting frictional rupture commonly
involves an analogy to ordinary crack propagation, with far-reaching
implications for various disciplines, from engineering tribology to geophysics.
An important feature of the analogy to cracks is the existence of a reduction
in the stress-bearing capacity of the ruptured interface, i.e. of a drop from
the applied stress, realized far ahead of a propagating rupture, to the
residual stress left behind it. Yet, how and under what conditions such finite
and well-defined stress drops emerge from basic physics are not well
understood. Here we show that for rapid rupture a stress drop is directly
related to wave radiation from the frictional interface to the bodies
surrounding it and to long-range bulk elastodynamics, and not exclusively to
the physics of the contact interface. Furthermore, we show that the emergence
of a stress drop is a transient effect, affected by the wave travel time in
finite systems and by the decay of long-range elastic interactions. Finally, we
supplement our results for rapid rupture with predictions for slow rupture. All
of the theoretical predictions are supported by available experimental data and
by extensive computations. Our findings elucidate the origin of stress drops in
frictional rupture, i.e. they offer a comprehensive and fundamental
understanding of why, how and to what extent frictional rupture might be viewed

and surveillance applications and has gained significant interest in recent
years. In patrolling, mobile robots repeatedly travel through an environment,
capture sensor data at certain sensing locations and deliver this data to the
base station in a way that maximizes the changes of detection. Robots move on
tours, exchange data when they meet with robots on neighboring tours and so
eventually deliver data to the base station.
  In this paper we jointly consider two important optimization criteria of
multi-robot patrolling: (i) idleness, i.e. the time between consecutive visits
of sensing locations, and (ii) delay, i.e. the time between capturing data at
the sensing location and its arrival at the base station. We systematically
investigate the effect of the robots' moving directions along their tours and
the selection of meeting points for data exchange. We prove that the problem of
determining the movement directions and meeting points such that the data delay
is minimized is NP-hard. We propose heuristics and provide a simulation study
which shows that the cooperative approach can outperform an uncooperative
approach where every robot delivers the captured data individually to the base
station.

which in turn, affects the critical behaviour. The effect is significant at the

measuring the error between new grasp attempts and the model prediction, the

possibility to coherently generate macroscopic quantum states, which have
attracted tremendous attention as ideal platforms for quantum simulation.
Ultracold atoms in optical lattices are one of such promising systems, where
their realizations of different phases of matter exhibit promising applications
in condensed matter physics, chemistry, and cosmology. Nevertheless, this is
only accessible with ultralow temperatures in the nano to micro Kelvin scale
set by the typical inverse mass of an atom. Alternative systems such as
lattices of trapped ions and superconducting circuit arrays also rely on
ultracold temperatures. Exciton polaritons with extremely light effective mass,
are regarded as promising alternatives to realize Bose-Einstein condensation in
lattices at higher temperatures. Along with the condensation, an efficient
exciton polariton quantum simulator would require a strong lattice with robust
trapping at each lattice site as well as strong inter-site coupling to allow
coherent quantum motion of polaritons within the lattice. However, exciton
polaritons in a strong lattice have only been shown to condense at liquid
helium temperatures. Here, we report the observation of exciton polariton
condensation in a one-dimensional strong lead halide perovskite lattice at room

perovskite lattice exhibits a large forbidden bandgap opening up to 13.3 meV

previous systems. Above a critical density, we observe exciton polariton
condensation into py orbital states with long-range spatial coherence at room

The original Weyl quadratic gravity,
based on Weyl conformal geometry, is a theory invariant under Weyl symmetry of
(gauged) local scale transformations. In this theory Planck scale ($M$) emerges
as the scale where this symmetry is broken spontaneously by a geometric
Stueckelberg mechanism, to Einstein-Proca action for the Weyl ""photon"" (of mass
near $M$). With this action as a ""low energy"" broken phase of Weyl gravity,
century-old criticisms of the latter (due to non-metricity) are avoided. In
this context, inflation with field values above $M$ is natural, since this is
just a phase transition scale from Weyl gravity (geometry) to Einstein gravity
(Riemannian geometry), where the massive Weyl photon decouples. We show that
inflation in Weyl gravity coupled to a scalar field has results close to those
in Starobinsky model (recovered for vanishing non-minimal coupling), with a
mildly smaller tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$). Weyl gravity predicts a specific,
narrow range $0.00257 \leq r\leq 0.00303$, for a spectral index $n_s$ within
experimental bounds at $68\%$CL and e-folds number $N=60$. This range of values
will soon be reached by CMB experiments and provides a test of Weyl gravity.
Unlike in the Starobinsky model, the prediction for $(r, n_s)$ is not affected
by unknown higher dimensional curvature operators (suppressed by some large
mass scale) since these are forbidden by the Weyl gauge symmetry.

network instabilities giving rise to oscillations, and the so-called `false

observed, without a change of stability) occurring beyond this onset. We
highlight that functional connectivity (FC) is inherited robustly from

false bifurcations, structure only weakly influences FC. Secondly, we develop a
weakly-coupled oscillator description to analyse oscillatory phase-locked

possibility to uncover statistical properties of the gas density and velocity
fields using reflected emission of a short (with duration much less than the
cloud's light-crossing time) X-ray flare. Such situation is relevant for the
Central Molecular Zone of our Galaxy where several clouds get illuminated by a
$\sim110$ yr-old flare from the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. Due to
shortness of the flare ($\Delta t\lesssim1.6$ yrs), only a thin slice ($\Delta
z\lesssim0.5$ pc) of the molecular gas contributes to the X-ray reflection
signal at any given moment, and its surface brightness effectively probes the
local gas density. This allows reconstructing the density probability
distribution function over a broad range of scales with virtually no influence
of attenuation, chemo-dynamical biases and projection effects. Such measurement
is key to understanding the structure and star-formation potential of the
clouds evolving under extreme conditions in the CMZ. For cloud parameters
similar to the currently brightest in X-ray reflection molecular complex Sgr A,
the sensitivity level of the best available data is sufficient only for
marginal distinction between solenoidal and compressive forcing of turbulence.
Future-generation X-ray observatories with large effective area and high
spectral resolution will dramatically improve on that by minimising systematic
uncertainties due to contaminating signals. Furthermore, measurement of the
iron fluorescent line centroid with sub-eV accuracy in combination with the
data on molecular line emission will allow direct investigation of the gas
velocity field.

With its high complexity, large size, and close distance, the
ringworld around GG Tau A is an appealing case to study the formation and
evolution of protoplanetary disks around multiple star systems. However,
investigations with radiative transfer models are usually neglecting the
influence of the circumstellar dust around the individual stars. Aims. We
investigate how circumstellar disks around the stars of GG Tau A are
influencing the emission that is scattered at the circumbinary disk and if
constraints on these circumstellar disks can be derived.
  Methods. We perform radiative transfer simulations with the code POLARIS to
obtain spectral energy distributions and emission maps in the H-Band
(near-infrared). Subsequently, we compare them with observations to achieve our
aims.
  Results. We studied the ratio of polarized intensity at different locations
in the circumbinary disk and conclude that the observed scattered-light
near-infrared emission is best reproduced, if the circumbinary disk lies in the
shadow of at least two co-planar circumstellar disks surrounding the central
stars. This implies that the inner wall of the circumbinary disk is strongly
obscured around the midplane, while the observed emission is actually dominated
by the most upper disk layers. In addition, the inclined dark lane (""gap"") on
the western side of the circumbinary disk, which is a stable (non rotating)
feature since ~20yr, can only be explained by the self-shadowing of a
misaligned circumstellar disk surrounding one of the two components of the
secondary close-binary star GG Tau Ab.

investigating such a rare decay it is necessary to minimize the background of
the experiment. In Phase II of the GERDA experiment the scintillation light of
liquid argon (LAr) is used as an additional background veto. In order to
estimate the efficiency of such a LAr veto it has to be known how far the
scintillation light, which peaks at 128 nm, can travel within the LAr. A
dedicated setup was built to measure the attenuation length of the
scintillation light in the LAr in-situ within the cryostat of GERDA. The setup
is composed of a stainless steel housing with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) at

  Furthermore, a sophisticated simulation was developed in order to determine
the solid angle correction as well as the background for this measurement. The
analysis results in an absorption length of $15.8 \pm 0.7$ (stat)

in their own language. A key component is an automated cognitive tutor that
guides the participants through a controlled escalation/de-escalation process
during the development of a joint narrative. We performed a controlled study
comparing a trained human mediator to the automated mediator. The results
demonstrate that an automated mediator, although simple at this stage,
effectively supports interactions and helps to achieve positive outcomes
comparable to those attained by the trained human mediator.

a multivariate statistical analysis of a sample that includes roughly one in

the traditional admissions metrics of undergraduate GPA and the Graduate
Records Examination (GRE) Quantitative, Verbal, and Physics Subject Tests do
not predict completion in US physics graduate programs with the efficacy often
assumed by admissions committees. We find only undergraduate GPA to have a
statistically significant association with physics PhD completion across all
models studied. In no model did GRE Physics or GRE Verbal predict PhD
completion. GRE Quantitative scores had statistically significant relationships
with PhD completion in two of four models studied. However, in practice,
probability of completing the PhD changed by less than 10 percentage points for
students scoring in the 10 ^th vs 90 ^th percentile of US test takers that were
physics majors. Noting the significant race, gender, and citizenship gaps in
GRE scores, these findings indicate that the heavy reliance on these test
scores within typical PhD admissions process is a deterrent to increasing
access, diversity, and equity in physics. Misuse of GRE scores selects against
already-underrepresented groups and US citizens with tools that fail to

Chemical segregation is observed in the AB Aur disk: HCO+ shows intense

the dust cavity, and ring-like emission at larger radii, while HCN is only
detected in an annular ring that is coincident with the dust ring and presents
an intense peak close to the dust trap. We use HCO+ to investigate the gas
dynamics inside the cavity. The observed bright HCO+ bridge connects the
compact central source with the outer dusty ring. This bridge can be
interpreted as an accretion flow from the outer ring to the inner disk/jet

fast acquisition because of its wide-field implementations, however, it has
been limited in resolution because a missing spatial-frequency band occurs when
trying to use a shift magnitude surpassing the cutoff frequency of the
detection system beyond a factor of two, which causes ghosting to appear. Here,
we propose a method of chip-based 3D nanoscopy through large and tunable
spatial-frequency-shift effect, capable of covering full extent of the
spatial-frequency component within a wide passband. The missing of
spatial-frequency can be effectively solved by developing a
spatial-frequency-shift actively tuning approach through wave vector
manipulation and operation of optical modes propagating along multiple
azimuthal directions on a waveguide chip to interfere. In addition, the method
includes a chip-based sectioning capability, which is enabled by saturated
absorption of fluorophores. By introducing ultra-large propagation effective
refractive index, nanoscale resolution is possible, without sacrificing the
temporal resolution and the field-of-view. Imaging on GaP waveguide material
demonstrates a lateral resolution of lamda/10, which is 5.4 folds above Abbe
diffraction limit, and an axial resolution of lamda/19 using 0.9 NA detection
objective. Simulation with an assumed propagation effective refractive index of
10 demonstrates a lateral resolution of lamda/22, in which the huge gap between
the directly shifted and the zero-order components is completely filled to
ensure the deep-subwavelength resolvability. It means that, a fast wide-field
3D deep-subdiffraction visualization could be realized using a standard
microscope by adding a mass-producible and cost-effective
spatial-frequency-shift illumination chip.

manipulation. Localization helps explain a positive detection by identifying
the pixels of the image which have been tampered. We propose a deep learning
based method for splice localization without prior knowledge of a test image's
camera-model. It comprises a novel approach for learning rich filters and for
suppressing image-edges. Additionally, we train our model on a surrogate task
of camera model identification, which allows us to leverage large and widely
available, unmanipulated, camera-tagged image databases. During inference, we
assume that the spliced and host regions come from different camera-models and
we segment these regions using a Gaussian-mixture model. Experiments on three
test databases demonstrate results on par with and above the state-of-the-art
and a good generalization ability to unknown datasets.

particles in smooth Randall-Sundrum models. For this, we show that it is
possible to find an effective potential which describe the motion of the
particle over the extra dimension. For the bosonic case it is a known fact that
free test particles cannot be localized neither in thin nor thick branes.
Recently, a coupling to a scalar field has been used to localize a limited
range of masses. Up to now, no mechanism has been found that can trap test
particles of any mass over the brane. To solve this, we show that a coupling
with the dilaton can trap particles of any mass. Next we analyze the spinning
particle. The spin variables $\psi^{P}$ introduces an interaction with the
curvature Riemann tensor. This introduces a correction to the effective
potential. By analyzing it, we find that the spinning particle can be localized
at a position different of the brane. We also show that a spinning particle
over the brane can escape to infinity. Therefore, we can conclude that free
bosonic and spinning particles are not trapped to the brane.

Recently, many defences have been proposed, but none have improved the
robustness of neural networks consistently. Here, we propose to use adversarial
attacks as a function evaluation to search for neural architectures that can
resist such attacks automatically. Experiments on neural architecture search
algorithms from the literature show that although accurate, they are not able
to find robust architectures. A significant reason for this lies in their
limited search space. By creating a novel neural architecture search with
options for dense layers to connect with convolution layers and vice-versa as
well as the addition of concatenation layers in the search, we were able to
evolve an architecture that is inherently accurate on adversarial samples.
Interestingly, this inherent robustness of the evolved architecture rivals
state-of-the-art defences such as adversarial training while being trained only
on the non-adversarial samples. Moreover, the evolved architecture makes use of
some peculiar traits which might be useful for developing even more robust
ones. Thus, the results here confirm that more robust architectures exist as
well as opens up a new realm of feasibilities for the development and
exploration of neural networks.

neutrino signal coming from the Sun would be a smoking gun. This possibility
relies on the DM capture by the Sun driven by the local DM distribution
assumptions: the local mass density and the velocity distribution. In this
context, we revisit those astrophysical hypotheses (also relevant for direct
detection). We focus especially on the DM velocity distribution considering
different possibilities beyond the popular Maxwellian distribution. Namely,
some alternatives can be considered through analytical approaches and by
looking into cosmological simulations of spiral galaxies. Most of the fitting
formulas used to constrain the local velocity distribution function fail to
describe the peak and the high velocity tail of the velocity distribution
observed in simulations, the latter being improved when adding the local escape
velocity of DM into the benchmark fitting models. In addition we test the
predictions by the Eddington inversion method and also illustrate the
importance of the galactic dynamical history. We estimate the resulting
uncertainties on the DM capture rate by the Sun and conclude that different
velocity distributions will affect the capture rate of DM by the Sun up to a
$15-20\%$. On top of that, the calculation of the intrinsic variance of the
capture rate leads to poorly controlled uncertainties especially for high WIMP
masses ($>$30 GeV) raising concerns about the capture scenario.

subjective or fail to detect very small differences. We propose the use of
quantization errors obtained from Self Organizing Maps for image content

added synthetic lesions. We have used a global approach that considers changes
on the entire image as opposed to changes in segmented lesion regions only. We
claim that this approach does not suffer from the limitations imposed by
segmentation, which may compromise the results. Results show quantization
errors increased with the increase in lesions on the images. The results are
also consistent with previous studies using alternative approaches. We then
compared the detectability ability of our method to that of human novice
observers having to detect very small local differences in random-dot images.
The quantization errors of the SOM outputs compared with correct positive
rates, after subtraction of false positive rates (guess rates), increased
noticeably and consistently with small increases in local dot size that were
not detectable by humans. We conclude that our method detects very small
changes in complex images and suggest that it could be implemented to assist

those involving spins coupled to each other, as over-simplifications of
empirical phenomena. At the same time, while models of rational agents who
strategically make choices based on complete information so as to maximize
their utility are commonly used in economics, many physicists consider them to
be caricatures of reality. We show here that while these contrasting approaches
may seem irreconcilable there are in fact many parallels and analogies between
them. In addition, we suggest that a new formulation of statistical mechanics
may be necessary to permit a complete mapping of the game-theoretic formalism
to a statistical physics framework. This may indeed turn out to be the most
significant contribution of econophysics.

the way for the monolithic growth on silicon of an efficient single photon

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SFL) is a promising technique to improve and
automate debugging. SFL techniques use control-flow spectra to pinpoint the
most suspicious program elements. However, data-flow spectra provide more
detailed information about the program execution, which may be useful for fault
localization. Aims: We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of ten SFL
ranking metrics using data-flow spectra. Method: We compare the performance of
data- and control-flow spectra for SFL using 163 faults from 5 real-world open
source programs, which contain from 468 to 4130 test cases. The data- and
control-flow spectra types used in our evaluation are definition-use
associations (DUAs) and lines, respectively. Results: Using data-flow spectra,
up to 50% more faults are ranked in the top-15 positions compared to
control-flow spectra. Also, most SFL ranking metrics present better
effectiveness using data-flow to inspect up to the top-40 positions. The
execution cost of data-flow spectra is higher than control-flow, taking from 22
seconds to less than 9 minutes. Data-flow has an average overhead of 353% for
all programs, while the average overhead for control-flow is of 102%.
Conclusions: The results suggest that SFL techniques can benefit from using
data-flow spectra to classify faults in better positions, which may lead
developers to inspect less code to find bugs. The execution cost to gather
data-flow is higher compared to control-flow, but it is not prohibitive.
Moreover, data-flow spectra also provide information about suspicious variables
for fault localization, which may improve the developers' performance using
SFL.

serially by miners and validators and determine the Proof-of-Work (PoW). Such
serial execution is unable to exploit modern multi-core resources efficiently,
hence limiting the system throughput and increasing the transaction acceptance
latency. The objective of this work is to increase the transaction throughput
by introducing parallel transaction execution using a static analysis
technique. We propose a framework DiPETrans for the distributed execution of
the transactions in a block. Here, peers in the blockchain network form a
community to execute the transactions and find the PoW parallelly, using a
leader-follower approach. During mining, the leader statically analyzes the
transactions, creates different groups (shards) of independent transactions,
and distributes them to followers to execute them in parallel. After the
transaction executes, the community's compute power is utilized to solve the
PoW concurrently. When a block is successfully created, the leader broadcasts
the proposed block to other peers in the network for validation. On receiving a
block, validators re-execute the block transactions and accept the block if
they reach the same state as shared by the miner. Validation can also be done
as a community, in parallel, following the same leader-follower approach as
mining. We report experiments using over 5 Million real transactions from the
Ethereum blockchain and execute them using our DiPETrans framework to
empirically validate the benefits of our techniques over traditional sequential
execution. We achieve a maximum speedup of 2.2x for the miner and 2.0x for the
validator, with 100 to 500 transactions per block. Further, we achieve a peak
of 5x end-to-end block creation speedup using a parallel miner over a serial
miner when using 6 machines in the community.

near Neptune. It was attributed to the existence of a partial ring or ring arc.
The existence of ring arcs around Neptune was confirmed during subsequent years
via other occultation experiments and by the Voyager 2 spacecraft. The Voyager
observations established that the Neptunian arcs are concentrations of
particles embedded within Neptune's narrow Adams ring, the outermost of six
tenuous rings discovered by Voyager and discussed here. Four ring arcs were
identified: the trailing arc Fraternit\'e, a double-component arc Egalit\'e,
dubbed Egalit\'e 1 and 2, Libert\'e, and the leading arc Courage. The arcs
varied in extent from $\sim$ 1$^\circ$ to $\sim$ 10$^\circ$, and together were
confined to a longitude range of 40$^\circ$, with typical radial widths of
$\sim$ 15 km and optical depth of order 0.1. The properties of the dusty
component of Neptune's rings are also discussed in this chapter. Although the
arcs should have been destroyed in a few months time through differential
Keplerian motion, they appeared to persist at least throughout the Voyager era,
and well beyond. However, observations from Earth (both with the Hubble Space
Telescope and ground-based adaptive optics) show an evolution in the last three
decades, with the disappearance of both Courage and Libert\'e by 2009. This
chapter reviews the constraints provided on the mean motion of the arcs and
Galatea, the satellite possibly responsible for the arc confinement. This in
turn constrains the various models that have been proposed to explain the arc
longevity.

neural network (NN) classifiers are widely used in many tasks which include
natural language processing, computer vision and cyber security. In recent
works, people noticed the existence of adversarial examples. These adversarial
examples break the NN classifiers' underlying assumption that the environment
is attack free and can easily mislead fully trained NN classifier without
noticeable changes. Among defensive methods, adversarial training is a popular
choice. However, original adversarial training with single-step adversarial
examples (Single-Adv) can not defend against iterative adversarial examples.
Although adversarial training with iterative adversarial examples (Iter-Adv)
can defend against iterative adversarial examples, it consumes too much
computational power and hence is not scalable. In this paper, we analyze
Iter-Adv techniques and identify two of their empirical properties. Based on
these properties, we propose modifications which enhance Single-Adv to perform
competitively as Iter-Adv. Through preliminary evaluation, we show that the
proposed method enhances the test accuracy of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
Single-Adv defensive method against iterative adversarial examples by up to
16.93% while reducing its training cost by 28.75%.

huge interest to learn the 'disentangled' latent variables, where each

many regularization approaches have been proposed on variational autoencoders,
heuristic tuning is required to balance between disentanglement and loss in
reconstruction accuracy -- due to the unsupervised nature, there is no
principled way to find an optimal weight for regularization. Motivated to
completely bypass regularization, we consider a projection strategy: modifying
the canonical Gaussian encoder, we add a layer of scaling and rotation to the
Gaussian mean, such that the marginal correlations among latent sub-coordinates
become exactly zero. This achieves a theoretically maximal disentanglement, as
guaranteed by zero cross-correlation between one latent sub-coordinate and the
observed varying with the rest. Unlike regularizations, the extra projection
layer does not impact the flexibility of the previous encoder layers, leading
to almost no loss in expressiveness. This approach is simple to implement in
practice. Our numerical experiments demonstrate very good performance, with no

Ichihara, who considered more general Hamiltonians but with better regularity
for $f$. Without enforcing this assumption, to our knowledge, there are no
results on uniqueness in the literature. In this short article, we show that
the equation has a unique positive solution for any locally Lipschitz
continuous, coercive $f$ which satisfies $|D f(x)| \le \kappa\bigl(1

$2-\frac{1}{\gamma}>1$, this assumption imposes very mild restrictions on the
growth of the potential $f$. We also show that this solution fully
characterizes optimality for the associated ergodic problem. Our method
involves the study of an infinite dimensional linear program for elliptic
equations for measures, and is very different from earlier approaches. It also
applies to the larger class of Hamiltonians studied by Ichihara, and we show
that it is well suited to provide verification of optimality results for the
associated ergodic control problems, even in a pathwise sense, and without

selective attention can single it out for scrutiny. The way in which these
well-known mechanisms, with rather opposing effects, interact remains largely
unknown. To address this, we had observers perform a gaze-contingent search
task that nudged them to deploy either spatial or feature-based attention to
maximize performance. We found that, depending on the type of attention
employed, visual spatial integration strength changed either in a strong and
localized or a more modest and global manner compared with a baseline

obstacles in the environment on-the-fly during the exploration. As the robot
has a specific energy budget, it might not be able to cover the complete
environment in one traversal. Instead, it will need to visit a static charging
station periodically in order to recharge its energy. To solve the stated
problem, we propose a budgeted depth-first search (DFS)-based exploration
strategy that helps the robot to cover any unknown planar environment while
bounding the maximum path length to a constant-factor of the shortest-possible
path length. Our $O(1)$-approximation guarantee advances the state-of-the-art

fields in subsurface flow and solute transport models remains a challenging
problem. This is mainly due to the non-Gaussian property, the non-linear
physics, and the fact that many repeated evaluations of the forward model are
often required. In this study, we develop a convolutional adversarial
autoencoder (CAAE) to parameterize non-Gaussian conductivity fields with
heterogeneous conductivity within each facies using a low-dimensional latent
representation. In addition, a deep residual dense convolutional network
(DRDCN) is proposed for surrogate modeling of forward models with
high-dimensional and highly-complex mappings. The two networks are both based
on a multilevel residual learning architecture called residual-in-residual
dense block. The multilevel residual learning strategy and the dense connection
structure ease the training of deep networks, enabling us to efficiently build
deeper networks that have an essentially increased capacity for approximating
mappings of very high-complexity. The CCAE and DRDCN networks are incorporated
into an iterative ensemble smoother to formulate an inversion framework. The
numerical experiments performed using 2-D and 3-D solute transport models
illustrate the performance of the integrated method. The obtained results
indicate that the CAAE is a robust parameterization method for non-Gaussian
conductivity fields with different heterogeneity patterns. The DRDCN is able to
obtain accurate approximations of the forward models with high-dimensional and
highly-complex mappings using relatively limited training data. The CAAE and
DRDCN methods together significantly reduce the computation time required to
achieve accurate inversion results.

can greatly improve the computational efficiency by using a small proxy model
to perform data selection (e.g., selecting data points to label for active

architectures, and training for fewer epochs, we create proxies that are an
order of magnitude faster to train. Although these small proxy models have
higher error rates, we find that they empirically provide useful signals for
data selection. We evaluate this ""selection via proxy"" (SVP) approach on
several data selection tasks across five datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet,

SVP can give an order of magnitude improvement in data selection runtime (i.e.,
the time it takes to repeatedly train and select points) without significantly
increasing the final error (often within 0.1%). For core-set selection on
CIFAR10, proxies that are over 10x faster to train than their larger, more

different at sub-proton scales where the magnetic energy spectrum measured by
different spacecrafts does not fit with the classical turbulence predictions: a
power law index close to $-8/3$ is generally reported which is far from the
predictions of strong and wave turbulence, $-7/3$ and $-5/2$ respectively. This
discrepancy is considered as a major problem for solar wind turbulence. Here,
we show with a nonlinear diffusion model of weak kinetic Alfv\'en wave
turbulence where the cascade is driven by local triadic interactions (Passot
and Sulem, 2019), that a magnetic spectrum with a power law index of $-8/3$ can
emerge. This scaling corresponds to a self-similar solution of the second kind
with a front propagation following the law $k_f \sim (t_*-t)^{-3/4}$, with
$t<t_*$. This solution appears when we relax the implicit assumption of
stationarity generally made in turbulence. The agreement between the theory and
observations can be interpreted as an evidence of the non-stationarity of solar
wind turbulence at sub-proton scales.

result given as functions of signal velocity, source-lens and lens-observer
distances, angular position of the source and lens mass. Two time delays,
$\Delta t_v$ between signals with different velocities but coming from same
side of the lens and $\Delta t_\mathrm{p}$ between signals from different sides
of the lens, as well as the difference $\Delta t_{\mathrm{p}v}$ between two
$\Delta t_\mathrm{p}$'s are calculated. These time delays are applied to the
gravitational-lensed supernova neutrinos and gravitational waves (GW). It is
shown that the $\Delta t_v$ between different mass eigenstates of supernova
neutrinos can be related to the mass square difference of these eigenstates and
therefore could potentially be used to discriminate neutrino mass orderings,
while the difference $\Delta t_{\mathrm{p}v}$ between neutrino and optical

modified Chaplygin gas (VMCG). We begin with a thermodynamical treatment of
VMCG described by the equation of state $P = A\rho-B\rho^{-\alpha}$, and obtain
its temperature as a function of redshift $z$. We show that the results are
consistent with similar works on other types of Chaplygin gas models. In
addition to deriving the exact expression of temperature of the fluid in terms
of the boundary conditions and redshift, we also used observational data to
determine the redshift at the epoch of transition from the decelerated to the
accelerated phase of expansion of the universe. The values of other relevant
parameters like the Hubble parameter, the equation-of-state parameter and the
speed of sound are obtained in terms of the redshift parameter, and these
values are compared with the results obtained from previous works on MCG and
other Chaplygin gas models for the various values of $n$ permitted by
thermodynamic stability. We assume the present value of temperature of the
microwave background radiation to be given by $ T_0 = 2.7 K $, and the
parameter $ A $ in the equation of state is taken as $ 1/3 $ since it
corresponds to the radiation-dominated phase of the universe. The value of the
parameter $\Omega_x$ has been assumed to be $0.7$ in our calculation. Since it
is known that the redshift of photon decoupling is $ z\simeq 1100 $, we used
this value to calculate the temperature of decoupling.

multislice modularity, is characterized by two model parameters, namely
resolution factor and inter-layer coupling factor. The former corresponds to a
notion of layer-specific relevance, whereas the inter-layer coupling factor
represents the strength of node connections across the network layers. Despite
the potential of this approach, the setting of both parameters can be
arbitrarily selected, without considering specific characteristics from the
topology of the multilayer network as well as from an available community
structure. Also, the multislice modularity is not designed to explicitly model
order relations over the layers, which is of prior importance for dynamic
networks.
  This paper aims to overcome the main limitations of the multislice modularity
by introducing a new formulation of modularity for multilayer networks. We
revise the role and semantics of both the resolution and inter-layer coupling
factors based on information available from the within-layer and inter-layer
structures of the multilayer communities. Also, our proposed multilayer
modularity is general enough to consider orderings of network layers and their
constraints on layer coupling. Experiments were carried out on synthetic and
real-world multilayer networks using state-of-the-art approaches for multilayer
community detection. The obtained results have shown the meaningfulness of the
proposed modularity, revealing the effects of different combinations of the
resolution and inter-layer coupling functions. This work also represents a
starting point for the development of new optimization methods for community
detection in multilayer networks.

established through observations of synchrotron radiation and Faraday rotation.
They are conjectured to be generated via small-scale dynamo by turbulent flow
motions in the intracluster medium (ICM). Some of giant radio relics, on the
other hand, show the structures of synchrotron polarization vectors, organized
over the scales of $\sim$ Mpc, challenging the turbulence origin of cluster
magnetic fields. Unlike turbulence in the interstellar medium, turbulence in
the ICM is subsonic. And it is driven sporadically in highly stratified
backgrounds, when major mergers occur during the hierarchical formation of
clusters. To investigate quantitatively the characteristics of turbulence
dynamo in such ICM environment, we performed a set of turbulence simulations
using a high-order-accurate, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code. We find that
turbulence dynamo could generate the cluster magnetic fields up to the observed
level from the primordial seed fields of $10^{-15}$ G or so within the age of
the universe, if the MHD description of the ICM could be extended down to
$\sim$ kpc scales. However, highly organized structures of polarization
vectors, such as those observed in the Sausage relic, are difficult to be
reproduced by the shock compression of turbulence-generated magnetic fields.
This implies that the modeling of giant radio relics may require the
pre-existing magnetic fields organized over $\sim$ Mpc scales.

with CRNs, where we think of the initial concentrations of some species as the

desiderata, permitting implementations that violate mass-action kinetics, or

then exactly characterize the functions computable by such CRNs as

often be used to solve highly non-linear problems at a much lower computational

the first method to perform fully non-linear, rapid and probabilistic Bayesian
inversion of travel time data for 2D velocity maps using a mixture density
network. We compare multiple methods to estimate probability density functions
that represent the tomographic solution, using different sets of prior
information and different training methodologies. We demonstrate the importance
of prior information in such high dimensional inverse problems due to the curse
of dimensionality: unrealistically informative prior probability distributions
may result in better estimates of the mean velocity structure, however the
uncertainties represented in the posterior probability density functions then
contain less information than is obtained when using a less informative prior.
This is illustrated by the emergence of uncertainty loops in posterior standard
deviation maps when inverting travel time data using a less informative prior,
which are not observed when using networks trained on prior information that
includes (unrealistic) a priori smoothness constraints in the velocity models.
We show that after an expensive program of training the networks, repeated

This is the well-known Trombi-Varadarajan theorem for spherical functions on

  U-Net",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantification of uncertainty in production/injection forecasting is an
important aspect of reservoir simulation studies. Conventional approaches
include intrusive Galerkin-based methods (e.g., generalized polynomial chaos
(gPC) and stochastic collocation (SC) methods) and non-intrusive Monte Carlo
(MC) based methods. Nevertheless, the quantification is conducted in
reformulations of the underlying stochastic PDEs with fixed well controls. If
one wants to take various well control plans into account, expensive
computations need to be repeated for each well design independently. In this
project, we take advantages of the equation-free spirit of convolutional neural
network (CNN) to overcome this challenge and thus achieve the flexibility of
efficient uncertainty quantification with various well controls. We are
interested in the development of surrogate models for uncertainty
quantification and propagation in reservoir simulations using a deep
convolutional encoder-decoder network as an analogue to the image-to-image
regression tasks in computer science. First, a U-Net architecture is applied to
replace conventional expensive deterministic PDE solver. Then we adopt the idea
from shape-guided image generation using variational U-Net and design a new
variational U-Net architecture for ""control-guided"" reservoir simulation.
Backward propagation is learned in the network to extract the hidden physical
quantities and then predict the future production by the learned forward
propagation using the hidden variable with various well controls. Comparisons
in computational efficiency are made between our proposed CNN approach and
conventional MC approach. Significant improvements in computational speed with
reasonable accuracy loss are observed in the numerical tests.

described as the gauge boson that appears when the free electrons' Lagrangian
in the crystal is requested to be locally gauge invariant with respect to T(3),
the group of the infinitesimal spatial translations. However, the
non-Abelianity of T(3) makes the acoustic phonon a frequency-gapped mode, in
contradiction with its description as Goldstone boson. A different perspective
overcomes this contradiction. In fact, we show that both the acoustic and
optical phonon - the latter never appearing following the other two approaches
- emerge respectively as the gapless Goldstone (phase) and the gapped Higgs
(amplitude) fluctuation mode of an order parameter arising from the spontaneous
breaking of a global symmetry, without invoking the gauge principle. The
optical phonon's frequency-gap is present in all regimes, and it arises from a
mass-like term in the Lagrangian due to the Higgs mechanism itself. Instead, an
eventual acoustic phonon's frequency-gap appears only in the strong nonlinear
regime, and it is due to an anharmonic term, the same term arising from the
gauging of T(3), an approach which did not provide any description of the
optical phonon, though. In addition, the Higgs mechanism describes all the
phonon-phonon interactions, including a possible perturbation on the acoustic
phonon's frequency dispersion relation induced by the eventual optical phonon,

2015 Ionescu and Jansson presented the approach underlying the ""Domain Specific
Languages of Mathematics"" (DSLsofMath) course even before the first course
instance. We were then encouraged to come back to present our experience and
the student results. Now, three years later, we have seen three groups of
learners attend the course, and the first two groups have also continued on to
take challenging courses in the subsequent year. In this paper we present three
examples from the course material to set the scene, and we present an
evaluation of the student results showing improvements in the pass rates and
grades in later courses.
