Carleson embedding theorem, featuring a matrix valued Carleson sequence as well
as products of norms for the embedding. We show that assuming an A2 weight is
also not sufficient. Indeed, a uniform bound on the conditioning number of the
matrix weight is necessary and sufficient to get the bilinear embedding. We
show that any improvement of a recent matrix weighted bilinear embedding,
featuring a scalar Carleson sequence and inner products instead of norms must
fail. In particular, replacing the scalar sequence by a matrix sequence results
in failure even when maintaining the formulation using inner products. Any
formulation using norms, even in the presence of a scalar Carleson sequence
must fail. As a positive result, we prove the so called matrix weighted

enhanced situational awareness for many emergency response and disaster
management applications since they are capable of operating in remote and
difficult to access areas. In addition, by utilizing an embedded platform and
deep learning UAVs can autonomously monitor a disaster stricken area, analyze
the image in real-time and alert in the presence of various calamities such as
collapsed buildings, flood, or fire in order to faster mitigate their effects
on the environment and on human population. To this end, this paper focuses on
the automated aerial scene classification of disaster events from on-board a
UAV. Specifically, a dedicated Aerial Image Database for Emergency Response
(AIDER) applications is introduced and a comparative analysis of existing
approaches is performed. Through this analysis a lightweight convolutional
neural network (CNN) architecture is developed, capable of running efficiently
on an embedded platform achieving ~3x higher performance compared to existing
models with minimal memory requirements with less than 2% accuracy drop
compared to the state-of-the-art. These preliminary results provide a solid
basis for further experimentation towards real-time aerial image classification
for emergency response applications using UAVs.

various words to which a numerical value corresponding to sentiment can be
assigned. In principle, classifiers can be obtained from these algorithms by
comparison with human annotation, which is considered the gold standard. In
practise this is difficult in languages such as Portuguese where there is a
paucity of human annotated texts. Thus in order to compare algorithms, a next
best step is to directly compare different algorithms with each other without
referring to human annotation. In this paper we develop methods for a
statistical comparison of algorithms which does not rely on human annotation or
on known class labels. We will motivate the use of marginal homogeneity tests,
as well as log linear models within the framework of maximum likelihood
estimation We will also show how some uncertainties present in lexicon based
sentiment analysis may be similar to those which occur in human annotated

the PIV is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis again based on both
the observed sample and the counterfactuals, provided the same null hypothesis
has already been rejected based on the observed sample. Under either
frequentist or Bayesian framework, one can bound the PIV of an inference based
on his bounded belief about the counterfactuals, which is often needed when the
unconfoundedness assumption is dubious. The PIV is equivalent to statistical
power when the NHST is thought to be based on both the observed sample and the
counterfactuals. We summarize the process of evaluating internal validity with
the PIV into an eight-step procedure and illustrate it with an empirical
example (i.e., Hong and Raudenbush (2005)).

which is not possible for the emerging case of hybrid quantum/classical

first derivatives of hybrid quantum/classical methods using only observable

construct the key first-derivative property of the nuclear energy gradient for
the recently-developed multistate, contracted variant of the variational
quantum eigensolver (MC-VQE) within the context of the ab initio exciton model
(AIEM). We show that a clean separation between the quantum and classical parts
of the problem is enabled by the definition of an appropriate set of relaxed
density matrices, and show how the wavefunction response equations in the
quantum part of the algorithm (coupled-perturbed MC-VQE or CP-MC-VQE equations)
are decoupled from the wavefunction response equations and and gradient
perturbations in the classical part of the algorithm. We explore the magnitudes

information and thus insensitive to outliers. The method is nonparametric,
objective, and the required data processing is parsimonious. Main ingredients
are a rank-order data matrix and its transform to a stable form, which provide
linear trends in excellent agreement with least squares regression, despite the
loss of magnitude information. A group symmetry orthogonal decomposition of the
2D rank-order transform for iid (white) noise is further ordered by principal
component analysis. This two-step procedure provides a noise ""etalon"" used to
characterize arbitrary stationary stochastic processes. The method readily
distinguishes both the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and chaos generated by the
logistic map from white noise. Ranking within randomness differs fundamentally
from that in deterministic chaos and signals, thus forming the basis for signal
detection. To further illustrate the breadth of applications, we apply this
ordinate method to the canonical nonlinear parameter estimation problem of
two-species radioactive decay, outperforming special-purpose least square
software. It is demonstrated that the method excels when extracting trends in
heavy-tailed noise and, unlike the Thiele-Sen estimator, is not limited to
linear regression. Lastly, a simple expression is given that yields a close
approximation for signal extraction of an underlying generally nonlinear

crystallographic re-orientations associated with the growth of twins, little is
known about the strengthening mechanisms associated with this deformation mode.
A crystal plasticity based phase field model for twinning is employed in this
work to study the strengthening mechanisms resulting from the interaction
between twin growth and precipitates. The full-field simulations reveal in
great detail the pinning and de-pinning of a twin boundary at individual
precipitates, resulting in a maximum resistance to twin growth when the
precipitate is partially embedded in the twin. Furthermore, statistically
representative precipitate distributions are used to systematically investigate
the influence of key microstructural parameters such as precipitate
orientation, volume fraction, size, and aspect ratio on the resistance to twin
growth. The results indicate that the effective critical resolved shear stress
(CRSS) for twin growth increases linearly with precipitate volume fraction and
aspect ratio. For a constant volume fraction of precipitates, reduction of the
precipitate size below a critical level produces a strong increase in the CRSS
due to the Orowan-like strengthening mechanism between the twin interface and
precipitates. Above this level the CRSS is size independent. The results are
quantitatively and qualitatively comparable with experimental measurements and

characterize the functors which induce such morphisms. In particular, we
examine continuous comorphism of sites and show that this class of comorphisms

general theorem providing necessary and sufficient explicit conditions for a
morphism of sites to induce an equivalence of toposes. This stems from a
detailed analysis of arrows in Grothendieck toposes and denseness conditions,
which yields results of independent interest. We also derive site
characterizations of the property of a geometric morphism to be an inclusion

off magnetic poles, which justifies the presence of velocity-dependent magnetic
charges as an effective description of either the behaviour of monopoles in
scattering with matter or their production from matter particles at colliders.
Hence, in such an approach, perturbativity of the magnetic charge is ensured
for relative low velocities of monopoles with respect to matter particles. The
model employs a ${\rm U(1)}_{\rm weak} \times {\rm U(1)}_{\rm strong}$
effective gauge field theory under which electrons and monopoles (assumed to be
fermions) are appropriately charged. The non-perturbative quantum effects of
the strongly coupled sector of the theory lead to dressed effective couplings
of the monopole/dyon with the electromagnetic photon, due to non-trivial
wave-function renormalization effects. For slowly-moving monopole/dyons, such
effects lead to weak coupling, thus turning the bare non-perturbative magnetic
charge, which is large due to the Dirac/Schwinger quantization rule, into a
perturbative effective, velocity-(""$\beta$"")-dependent magnetic coupling. Our
work thus offers formal support to previous conjectural studies, employing
effective U(1)-electromagnetic gauge field theories for the description of
monopole production from Standard Model matter, which are used in contemporary
collider searches of such objects. This work necessarily pertains to composite
monopoles, as seems to be the case of all known monopoles so far, that are
solutions of specific particle physics models. This is a consequence of the
fact that the wave-function renormalization of the (slowly-moving) monopole
fermion turns out to violate unitarity bounds that would characterise
asymptotic elementary particle states.

the training trajectory, and the latter can struggle in textureless regions. By
contrast, scene coordinate regression (SCoRe) methods generalise to novel poses
and can leverage dense correspondences to improve robustness, and recent work
has shown how to adapt SCoRe forests between scenes, allowing their
state-of-the-art performance to be leveraged online. However, because they use
features hand-crafted for indoor use, they do not generalise well to harder
outdoor scenes. Whilst replacing the forest with a neural network and learning
suitable features for outdoor use is possible, the techniques used to adapt
forests between scenes are unfortunately harder to transfer to a network
context. In this paper, we address this by proposing a novel way of leveraging
a network trained on one scene to predict points in another scene. Our approach
replaces the appearance clustering performed by the branching structure of a
regression forest with a two-step process that first uses the network to
predict points in the original scene, and then uses these predicted points to
look up clusters of points from the new scene. We show experimentally that our

representations from both network structure and node attributes. Existing
methods can be categorized into two groups: (1) the first group learns two
separated node representations from network structure and node attribute
respectively and concatenates them together; (2) the other group obtains node
representations by translating node attributes into network structure or vice
versa. However, both groups have their drawbacks. The first group neglects the
correlation between network structure and node attributes, while the second
group assumes strong dependence between these two types of information. In this
paper, we address attributed network embedding from a novel perspective, i.e.,
learning node context representation for each node via modeling its attributed
local subgraph. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel attributed network
auto-encoder framework, namely ANAE. For a target node, ANAE first aggregates
the attribute information from its attributed local subgraph, obtaining its
low-dimensional representation. Next, ANAE diffuses the representation of the
target node to nodes in its local subgraph to reconstruct their attributes.
Such an encoder-decoder framework allows the learned representations to better
preserve the context information manifested in both network structure and node
attributes, thus having high capacity to learn good node representations for
attributed network. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art
approaches at the tasks of link prediction and node classification.

that introduces two parameters $\{Q,\eta\}$ at the level of linear
perturbations and allow to take into account the modified clustering (or
effective gravitational constant) and anisotropic stress appearing in models
beyond $\Lambda$CDM. We characterize the effective dark energy fluid by an
equation of state parameter $w=-0.95$ and various sound speed cases in the
range $10^{-6}\leq c^2_s\leq 1$, thus covering K-essence and quintessence
cosmologies. We calculate the angular power spectra of standard and
relativistic effects for these scenarios under the $\{Q,\eta\}$
parametrization, and we compare these relative to a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology. We find that, overall, deviations relative to $\Lambda$CDM are
stronger at low redshift since the behavior of the dark energy fluid can mimic
the cosmological constant during matter domination era but departs during dark
energy domination. In particular, at $z=0.1$ the matter density fluctuations
are suppressed by up to $\sim3\%$ for the quintessence-like case, while
redshift-space distortions and Doppler effect can be enhanced by $\sim15\%$ at
large scales for the lowest sound speed scenario. On the other hand, at $z=2$
we find deviations of up to $\sim5\%$ in gravitational lensing, whereas the
Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect can deviate up to $\sim17\%$. Furthermore, when
considering an imperfect dark energy fluid scenario, we find that all effects
are insensitive to the presence of anisotropic stress at low redshift, and only
the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect can detect this feature at $z=2$ and very

liquid film, wetting a flat substrate inclined at a non-zero angle to the
horizontal. The dynamics of the thin film is influenced by an electric field
which is set up parallel to the substrate surface - this nonlocal physical
mechanism has a linearly stabilizing effect on the interfacial dynamics. Our
particular interest is in fluid films that are hanging from the underside of
the substrate; these films may drip depending on physical parameters, and we
investigate whether a sufficiently strong electric field can suppress such
nonlinear phenomena. For a non-electrified flow, it was observed by Brun et al.
(Phys. Fluids 27, 084107, 2015) that the thresholds of linear absolute
instability and dripping are reasonably close. In the present study, we
incorporate an electric field and analyse the absolute/convective instabilities
of a hierarchy of reduced-order models to predict the dripping limit in
parameter space. The spatial stability results for the reduced-order models are
verified by performing an impulse-response analysis with direct numerical
simulations (DNS) of the Navier-Stokes equations coupled to the appropriate
electrical equations. Guided by the results of the linear theory, we perform
DNS on extended domains with inflow/outflow conditions (mimicking an
experimental set-up) to investigate the dripping limit for both non-electrified
and electrified liquid films. For the latter, we find that the absolute
instability threshold provides an order-of-magnitude estimate for the electric
field strength required to suppress dripping; the linear theory may thus be
used to determine the feasibility of dripping suppression given a set of
geometrical, fluid and electrical parameters.

lensing and large-scale structure tracers will be an important cosmological
probe in the coming years. Quadratic estimators provide a simple and powerful
(if suboptimal) way to reconstruct the CMB lensing potential and are widely
used. For Gaussian fields, the cross-correlation of a quadratic-estimator CMB
lensing reconstruction with a tracer is exactly unbiased if the power spectra
are known and consistent analytic lensing mode response functions are used.
However, the bispectrum induced by non-linear large-scale structure growth and
post-Born lensing can introduce an additional bias term ($N_L^{(3/2)}$) in the
cross-correlation spectrum, similar to the $N_L^{(3/2)}$ bias in the
auto-spectrum demonstrated in recent works. We give analytic flat-sky results
for the cross-correlation bias using approximate models for the post-Born and
large-scale structure cross-bispectra, and compare with N-body simulation
results using ray-tracing techniques. We show that the bias can be at the
5-15\% level in all large-scale structure cross-correlations using small-scale
CMB temperature lensing reconstruction, but is substantially reduced using
polarization-based lensing estimators or simple foreground-projected
temperature estimators. The relative magnitude of these effects is almost three
times higher than in the CMB lensing auto-correlation, but is small enough that
it can be modelled to sufficient precision using simple analytic models. We
show that $N_L^{(3/2)}$ effects in cross-correlation will be detected with high

that the eigenvalue problem in the coupling parameter $v$ leads to spectral
functions of the form $v= G(E)$ which are concave, and at most uni-modal with a
maximum near the lower limit $E = -m$ of the eigenenergy $E \in (-m, \, m)$.

recent deep learning models encode attention mechanisms to focus on the most
task-relevant parts of the input signal for further processing, which is called
Machine/Neural/Artificial attention. Understanding the relation between human
and machine attention is important for interpreting and designing neural
networks. Many works claim that the attention mechanism offers an extra
dimension of interpretability by explaining where the neural networks look.
However, recent studies demonstrate that artificial attention maps do not
always coincide with common intuition. In view of these conflicting evidence,
here we make a systematic study on using artificial attention and human
attention in neural network design. With three example computer vision tasks,
diverse representative backbones, and famous architectures, corresponding real
human gaze data, and systematically conducted large-scale quantitative studies,
we quantify the consistency between artificial attention and human visual
attention and offer novel insights into existing artificial attention
mechanisms by giving preliminary answers to several key questions related to
human and artificial attention mechanisms. Overall results demonstrate that
human attention can benchmark the meaningful `ground-truth' in attention-driven
tasks, where the more the artificial attention is close to human attention, the
better the performance; for higher-level vision tasks, it is case-by-case. It
would be advisable for attention-driven tasks to explicitly force a better
alignment between artificial and human attention to boost the performance; such
alignment would also improve the network explainability for higher-level
computer vision tasks.

we consider the presence of non-BPS five branes, which allows the construction
of apparent stable dS vacua. Since moduli stabilization requires the presence
of NS-NS fluxes, we also describe the minimal required conditions to avoid the
appearance of Freed-Witten anomalies. Cancellation of these anomalies implies a
topological transformation between non-BPS states and fluxes with the same
discrete K- theory charge. After the transition, we observe that the scalar
potential undergoes major changes, implying that the dS vacua are unstable. We
discuss a scenario in which, even if the discrete K-theory charge is globally
cancelled, the above transitions could still be relevant, allowing the
existence of short-lived dS minima. We briefly comment on how these

increased diversity of information and perspectives for users -- has
exacerbated user polarization on many issues. A popular theory for this
phenomenon centers on the concept of ""filter bubbles"": by automatically
recommending content that a user is likely to agree with, social network
algorithms create echo chambers of similarly-minded users that would not have
arisen otherwise. However, while echo chambers have been observed in real-world
networks, the evidence for filter bubbles is largely post-hoc.
  In this work, we develop a mathematical framework to study the filter bubble
theory. We modify the classic Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model by
introducing another actor, the network administrator, who filters content for
users by making small changes to the edge weights of a social network (for
example, adjusting a news feed algorithm to change the level of interaction
between users).
  On real-world networks from Reddit and Twitter, we show that when the network
administrator is incentivized to reduce disagreement among users, even
relatively small edge changes can result in the formation of echo chambers in
the network and increase user polarization. We theoretically support this
observed sensitivity of social networks to outside intervention by analyzing
synthetic graphs generated from the stochastic block model. Finally, we show
that a slight modification to the incentives of the network administrator can
mitigate the filter bubble effect while minimally affecting the administrator's
target objective, user disagreement.

IR-to-HCN ratios, observational proxies for the dense gas fraction and dense
gas star formation efficiency, depend on host galaxy and local environment. We
find that the fraction of dense gas correlates with stellar surface density,
gas surface density, molecular-to-atomic gas ratio, and dynamical equilibrium
pressure. In EMPIRE, the star formation rate per unit dense gas anti-correlates
with these same environmental parameters. Thus, although dense gas appears
abundant the central regions of many spiral galaxies, this gas appears
relatively inefficient at forming stars. These results qualitatively agree with
previous work on nearby galaxies and the Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone. To
first order, EMPIRE demonstrates that the conditions in a galaxy disk set the
gas density distribution and that the dense gas traced by HCN shows an
environment-dependent relation to star formation. However, our results also
show significant ($\pm 0.2$ dex) galaxy-to-galaxy variations. We suggest that

lower limit to the true FUV/NUV ratio since the GALEX FUV band does not include
Lyman-alpha, which dominates the FUV output of low-mass stars. This is a

black hole transition dynamically to spheroidal, differentially rotating stars

as the Kozai-Lidov mechanism, can pump the exoplanet's eccentricity up to
values that will destroy it via a collision or strong interaction with its
parent star. During the final stages of this process, any exomoons orbiting the
exoplanet will be detached by the star's tidal force and placed into orbit
around the star. Using ensembles of three and four-body simulations, we
demonstrate that while most of these detached bodies either collide with their
star or are ejected from the system, a substantial fraction, ~10%, of such
""orphaned"" exomoons (with initial properties similar to those of the Galilean
satellites in our own solar system) will outlive their parent exoplanet. The
detached exomoons generally orbit inside the ice line, so that strong radiative
heating will evaporate any volatile-rich layers, producing a strong outgassing
of gas and dust, analogous to a comet's perihelion passage. Small dust grains
ejected from the exomoon may help generate an opaque cloud surrounding the
orbiting body but are quickly removed by radiation blow-out. By contrast,
larger solid particles inherit the orbital properties of the parent exomoon,
feeding an eccentric disk of solids that drains more gradually onto the star
via Poynting-Robertson drag, and which could result in longer-timescale dimming
of the star. For characteristic exomoon evaporation times of ~ 1e5-1e6 yr,
attenuation of the stellar light arising from one or more out-gassing exomoons
provides a promising explanation for both the dipping and secular dimming

mismatch exhibits an extra ""confinement"" effect, which are most pronounced
within a certain range of the cavity radius and the electrostatic strength
between the monomers and counterions and multivalent counterions. For cavities
with a charged surface, surface polarization leads to an increased amount of
counterions adsorbed in the outer side, further compressing the confined

conformation of the chain is dependent upon several key factors including the
relative permittivities of the media inside and outside the cavity, multivalent

factor limiting the system performance. One way to alleviate this problem is to
manage the radio resources in order to maximize either the average or the
worst-case performance. However, joint consideration of both metrics is often
neglected as they are competing in nature. In this article, a mechanism for
radio resource management using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL) is
proposed, which strikes the right trade-off between maximizing the average and
the $5^{th}$ percentile user throughput. Each transmitter in the network is
equipped with a deep RL agent, receiving partial observations from the network
(e.g., channel quality, interference level, etc.) and deciding whether to be
active or inactive at each scheduling interval for given radio resources, a
process referred to as link scheduling. Based on the actions of all agents, the
network emits a reward to the agents, indicating how good their joint decisions
were. The proposed framework enables the agents to make decisions in a
distributed manner, and the reward is designed in such a way that the agents
strive to guarantee a minimum performance, leading to a fair resource
allocation among all users across the network. Simulation results demonstrate
the superiority of our approach compared to decentralized baselines in terms of
average and $5^{th}$ percentile user throughput, while achieving performance
close to that of a centralized exhaustive search approach. Moreover, the
proposed framework is robust to mismatches between training and testing
scenarios. In particular, it is shown that an agent trained on a network with
low transmitter density maintains its performance and outperforms the baselines
when deployed in a network with a higher transmitter density.

propagate as a collective mode. In particular, tachyonic instabilities can
appear, leading to ""fast flavor conversion"" that is independent of neutrino
masses and mixing angles. On the other hand, without neutrino-neutrino
interaction, a prepared wave packet of flavor coherence simply dissipates by
kinematical decoherence of infinitely many non-collective modes. We reexamine
the dispersion relation for fast flavor modes and show that for any
wavenumber,there exists a continuum of non-collective modes besides a few
discrete collective ones. So for any initial wave packet, both decoherence and
collective motion occurs, although the latter typically dominates for a
sufficiently dense gas. We derive explicit eigenfunctions for both collective
and non-collective modes. If the angular mode distribution of electron-lepton
number crosses between positive and negative values, two non-collective modes
can merge to become a tachyonic collective mode. We explicitly calculate the
interaction strength for this critical point. As a corollary we find that a
single crossing always leads to a tachyonic instability. For an even number of
crossings, no instability needs to occur.

gas around the disintegrating rocky exoplanet K2-22 b to constrain its gas-loss
and sublimation processes.
  Methods. We observed four transits of K2-22 b with X-shooter on ESO's Very
Large Telescope to obtain time-series of intermediate-resolution (R $\sim$
11400) spectra. Our analysis focused on the two sodium D lines (588.995 nm and
589.592 nm) and the Ca$^{+}$ triplet (849.802 nm, 854.209 nm and 866.214 nm).
Planet-related absorption is searched for in the velocity rest frame of the
planet, which changes from $\pm$66 kms$^{-1}$ during the transit.
  Results. Since K2-22 b exhibits highly variable transit depths, we analyzed
the individual nights and their average. By injecting signals we reached
5$\sigma$ upper-limits on the individual nights that ranged from 11% - 13% and
1.7% - 2.0% for the tail's sodium and ionized calcium absorption, respectively.
Night 1 was contaminated by its companion star so we considered weighted
averages with and without Night 1 and quote conservative 5$\sigma$ limits
without Night 1 of 9% and 1.4%, respectively. Assuming their mass fractions to
be similar to those in the Earth's crust, these limits correspond to scenarios
in which 0.04% and 35% of the transiting dust is sublimated and observed as
absorbing gas. However, this assumes the gas to be co-moving with the planet.
We show that for the high irradiation environment of K2-22 b, sodium and
ionized calcium could be quickly accelerated to 100s of km s$^{-1}$ due to
radiation pressure and entrainment by the stellar wind, making them much more
difficult to detect. No evidence for such possibly broad and blue-shifted
signals are seen in our data.
  Conclusions. Future observations aimed at observing circumplanetary gas
should take into account the possible broad and blue-shifted velocity field of
atomic and ionized species.

the major challenges in using detection systems in practice is in dealing with
an overwhelming number of alerts that are triggered by normal behavior (the
so-called false positives), obscuring alerts resulting from actual malicious
activity. While numerous methods for reducing the scope of this issue have been
proposed, ultimately one must still decide how to prioritize which alerts to
investigate, and most existing prioritization methods are heuristic, for
example, based on suspiciousness or priority scores. We introduce a novel
approach for computing a policy for prioritizing alerts using adversarial
reinforcement learning. Our approach assumes that the attackers know the full
state of the detection system and dynamically choose an optimal attack as a
function of this state, as well as of the alert prioritization policy. The
first step of our approach is to capture the interaction between the defender
and attacker in a game theoretic model. To tackle the computational complexity
of solving this game to obtain a dynamic stochastic alert prioritization
policy, we propose an adversarial reinforcement learning framework. In this
framework, we use neural reinforcement learning to compute best response
policies for both the defender and the adversary to an arbitrary stochastic
policy of the other. We then use these in a double-oracle framework to obtain
an approximate equilibrium of the game, which in turn yields a robust
stochastic policy for the defender. Extensive experiments using case studies in
fraud and intrusion detection demonstrate that our approach is effective in
creating robust alert prioritization policies.

circuit design, where the challenge is to connect a large and arbitrary number
of circuit components with wires without violating the design rules for the
printed circuit boards or integrated circuits. Similar routing problems also
exist in the design of complex hydraulic systems, pipe systems and logistic
networks. Existing solutions typically consist of greedy algorithms and
hard-coded heuristics. As such, existing approaches suffer from a lack of model
flexibility and non-optimum solutions. As an alternative approach, this work
presents a deep reinforcement learning method for solving the global routing
problem in a simulated environment. At the heart of the proposed method is deep
reinforcement learning that enables an agent to produce an optimal policy for
routing based on the variety of problems it is presented with leveraging the
conjoint optimization mechanism of deep reinforcement learning. Conjoint
optimization mechanism is explained and demonstrated in details; the best
network structure and the parameters of the learned model are explored. Based
on the fine-tuned model, routing solutions and rewards are presented and
analyzed. The results indicate that the approach can outperform the benchmark
method of a sequential A* method, suggesting a promising potential for deep
reinforcement learning for global routing and other routing or path planning
problems in general. Another major contribution of this work is the development
of a global routing problem sets generator with the ability to generate
parameterized global routing problem sets with different size and constraints,
enabling evaluation of different routing algorithms and the generation of

considered. Conventionally, Shannon's random coding arguments -- using randomly
generated unstructured codebooks whose blocklength is taken to be
asymptotically large -- are used to derive achievability results. However, it
was recently observed that in various multi-terminal communications scenarios,
using random codes with constant finite blocklength may lead to improved
achievable regions compared to the conventional approach. In other words, in
some network communication scenarios, there is a finite optimal value in the
blocklength of the randomly generated code used for distributed processing of
information sources. Motivated by this, a coding scheme is proposed which
consists of two codebook layers: i) the primary codebook which has constant
finite blocklength, and ii) the secondary codebook whose blocklength is taken
to be asymptotically large. The achievable region is analyzed in two steps. In
the first step, a characterization of the achievable region is derived using
information measures which are functions of multi-letter probability
distributions. In the next step, a computable single-letter inner-bound to the
achievable region is derived. It is shown through several examples that the

maximization problem is formulated that involves a joint optimization of the
task offloading decisions, computation resource allocation, and caching
decisions. To tackle this challenging problem, a single-agent Q-learning
(SAQ-learning) algorithm is invoked to learn a long-term resource allocation
strategy. Furthermore, a Bayesian learning automata (BLA) based multi-agent
Q-learning (MAQ-learning) algorithm is proposed for task offloading decisions.
More specifically, a BLA based action select scheme is proposed for the agents
in MAQ-learning to select the optimal action in every state. We prove that the
BLA based action selection scheme is instantaneously self-correcting and the
selected action is an optimal solution for each state. Extensive simulation
results demonstrate that: 1) The prediction error of the proposed LSTMs based
task popularity prediction decreases with increasing learning rate. 2) The
proposed framework significantly outperforms the benchmarks like all local

BLA based MAQ-learning achieves an improved performance compared to
conventional reinforcement learning algorithms.

the homoenergetic solutions for the Boltzmann equation that we began in [18].
They have the form $f\left( x,v,t\right) =g\left(v-L\left( t\right) x,t\right)
$ where $L\left( t\right) =A\left(I+tA\right) ^{-1}$ where $A$ is a constant
matrix. Homoenergetic solutions satisfy an integro-differential equation which
contains, in addition to the classical Boltzmann collision operator, a linear
hyperbolic term. Depending on the properties of the collision kernel the
collision and the hyperbolic terms might be of the same order of magnitude as
$t\to\infty$, or the collision term could be the dominant one for large times,
or the hyperbolic term could be the largest. The first case has been rigorously
studied in [17]. Formal asymptotic expansions in the second case have been
obtained in [18]. All the solutions obtained in this case can be approximated
by Maxwellian distributions with changing temperature. In this paper we focus
in the case where the hyperbolic terms are much larger than the collision term
for large times (hyperbolic-dominated behavior). In the hyperbolic-dominated
case it does not seem to be possible to describe in a simple way all the long
time asymptotics of the solutions, but we discuss several physical situations
and formulate precise conjectures. We give explicit formulas for the
relationship between density, temperature and entropy for these solutions.
These formulas differ greatly from the ones at equilibrium.

Previous literature has employed electroencephalography (EEG) to this end
despite having observed that EEG correlates of mental workload vary across
subjects and physical strain, thus making it difficult to devise models capable
of simultaneously presenting reliable performance across users. Domain
adaptation consists of a set of strategies that aim at allowing for improving
machine learning systems performance on unseen data at training time. Such
methods, however, might rely on assumptions over the considered data
distributions, which typically do not hold for applications of EEG data.
Motivated by this observation, in this work we propose a strategy to estimate
two types of discrepancies between multiple data distributions, namely marginal
and conditional shifts, observed on data collected from different subjects.
Besides shedding light on the assumptions that hold for a particular dataset,
the estimates of statistical shifts obtained with the proposed approach can be
used for investigating other aspects of a machine learning pipeline, such as
quantitatively assessing the effectiveness of domain adaptation strategies. In
particular, we consider EEG data collected from individuals performing mental
tasks while running on a treadmill and pedaling on a stationary bike and
explore the effects of different normalization strategies commonly used to
mitigate cross-subject variability. We show the effects that different
normalization schemes have on statistical shifts and their relationship with

short-term evolution and for reproducing the long-term statistics of a
multi-scale spatio-temporal Lorenz 96 system is examined. The methods are: echo
state network (a type of reservoir computing, RC-ESN), deep feed-forward
artificial neural network (ANN), and recurrent neural network with long
short-term memory (RNN-LSTM). This Lorenz 96 system has three tiers of
nonlinearly interacting variables representing slow/large-scale ($X$),
intermediate ($Y$), and fast/small-scale ($Z$) processes. For training or
testing, only $X$ is available; $Y$ and $Z$ are never known or used. We show
that RC-ESN substantially outperforms ANN and RNN-LSTM for short-term
prediction, e.g., accurately forecasting the chaotic trajectories for hundreds
of numerical solver's time steps, equivalent to several Lyapunov timescales.
The RNN-LSTM and ANN show some prediction skills as well; RNN-LSTM bests ANN.
Furthermore, even after losing the trajectory, data predicted by RC-ESN and
RNN-LSTM have probability density functions (PDFs) that closely match the true
PDF, even at the tails. The PDF of the data predicted using ANN, however,
deviates from the true PDF. Implications, caveats, and applications to
data-driven and data-assisted surrogate modeling of complex nonlinear dynamical
systems such as weather/climate are discussed.

shrink. While this shrinkage improves performance and density, it also reduces
trust: the price to build leading-edge fabrication facilities has skyrocketed,
forcing even nation states to outsource the fabrication of high-performance
ICs. Outsourcing fabrication presents a security threat because the black-box
nature of a fabricated IC makes comprehensive inspection infeasible. Since
prior work shows the feasibility of fabrication-time attackers' evasion of
existing post-fabrication defenses, IC designers must be able to protect their
physical designs before handing them off to an untrusted foundry. To this end,
recent work suggests methods to harden IC layouts against attack.
Unfortunately, no tool exists to assess the effectiveness of the proposed
defenses---meaning gaps may exist.
  This paper presents an extensible IC layout security analysis tool called IC
Attack Surface (ICAS) that quantifies defensive coverage. For researchers, ICAS
identifies gaps for future defenses to target, and enables the quantitative
comparison of existing and future defenses. For practitioners, ICAS enables the
exploration of the impact of design decisions on an IC's resilience to
fabrication-time attack. ICAS takes a set of metrics that encode the challenge
of inserting a hardware Trojan into an IC layout, a set of attacks that the
defender cares about, and a completed IC layout and reports the number of ways
an attacker can add each attack to the design. While the ideal score is zero,
practically, our experience is that lower scores correlate with increased
attacker effort.

advancement significantly improves computing capability, fabrication costs have
skyrocketed. As a result, most IC designers must now outsource fabrication.
Outsourcing, however, presents a security threat: comprehensive
post-fabrication inspection is infeasible given the size of modern ICs, so it
is nearly impossible to know if the foundry has altered the original design
during fabrication (i.e., inserted a hardware Trojan). Defending against a
foundry-side adversary is challenging because---even with as few as two
gates---hardware Trojans can completely undermine software security.
Researchers have attempted to both detect and prevent foundry-side attacks, but
all existing defenses are ineffective against Trojans with footprints of a few
gates or less.
  We present Targeted Tamper-Evident Routing (T-TER), a preventive layout-level
defense against untrusted foundries, capable of thwarting the insertion of even
the stealthiest hardware Trojans. T-TER is directed and routing-centric: it
prevents foundry-side attackers from routing Trojan wires to, or directly
adjacent to, security-critical wires by shielding them with guard wires. Unlike
shield wires commonly deployed for cross-talk reduction, T-TER guard wires pose
an additional technical challenge: they must be tamper-evident in both the
digital (deletion attacks) and analog (move and jog attacks) domains. We
address this challenge by developing a class of designed-in guard wires, that
are added to the design specifically to protect security-critical wires.
T-TER's guard wires incur minimal overhead, scale with design complexity, and
provide tamper-evidence against attacks.

that there are certain periods such as holiday season in which excessive demand
is observed. The demand strictly exceeds the carrier's capacity; even though,
the average demand can be still fulfilled throughout the year. In this sense,
we let the carrier has three options to respond to the demand: Dispersing the
demand with a penalty, leasing additional asset(s) temporarily, and outsourcing
some capacity. We propose a modeling and solution approach that jointly
incorporates asset management and sizing, outsourcing (3PLs), and
earliness/tardiness penalties. The objective is to minimize the overall
operational costs by optimally selecting and scheduling the home fleet with
respect to 'demand shifting' choices, selecting services from third parties,
and routing the commodities on the designed network. We propose an arc-based
formulation as well as valid inequalities and present a comprehensive
computational study on the randomly generated instances. The formulations with
valid inequalities (VIs) outperform the regular formulation in obtaining
tighter lower bounds. One set of VIs can improve the CPU time elapsed by 25% on

localization performance by leveraging the use of zero-type constraint
equations in the navigation filter. Without external aiding, inertial
navigation solutions inherently exhibit cubic error growth. Furthermore, for
planetary rovers that are traversing diverse types of terrain, wheel odometry
is often unreliable for use in localization, due to wheel slippage. For current
Mars rovers, computer vision-based approaches are generally used whenever there
is a high possibility of positioning error; however, these strategies require
additional computational power, energy resources, and significantly slow down
the rover traverse speed. To this end, we propose a navigation approach that
compensates for the high likelihood of odometry errors by providing a reliable
navigation solution that leverages non-holonomic vehicle constraints as well as
state-aware pseudo-measurements (e.g., zero velocity and zero angular rate)
updates during periodic stops. By using this, computationally expensive
visual-based corrections could be performed less often. Experimental tests that
compare against GPS-based localization are used to demonstrate the accuracy of
the proposed approach. The source code, post-processing scripts, and example
datasets associated with the paper are published in a public repository.

advantageous in settings where scalable model training is a consideration (for
instance in an industrial environment where multiple and frequent updates need
to be made to the classification system). In this paper, we conduct empirical
analysis on realizing independent updates to OVA models and its impact on the
accuracy of the overall OVA system. Given that asynchronous updates lead to
differences in training datasets for OVA models, we first define a metric to
quantify the differences in datasets. Thereafter, using Natural Language
Understanding as a task of interest, we estimate the impact of three factors:
(i) number of classes, (ii) number of data points and, (iii) divergences in

observe the accuracy impact of increased asynchrony in a Spoken Language

We propose a method for defining an order for a sampling basis that is optimal
with respect to capturing variance in data, thus allowing for meaningful
sensing at any desired level of compression. We focus on the Walsh-Hadamard
sampling basis for its relevance to hardware constraints, but our approach

our method on the Physical Sciences Inc. Fabry-P\'{e}rot interferometer sensor

our sampling and reconstruction with the adaptive coherence estimator (ACE) and
bulk coherence for chemical detection and we incorporate an algorithmic
threshold for ACE values to determine the presence or absence of a chemical. We
compare results across sampling methods in this context. We have successful
chemical detection at a compression rate of 90%. For all three datasets, we
compare our sampling approach to standard orderings of sampling basis such as
random, sequency, and an analog of sequency that we term `frequency.' In one

approaches that only find a device placement for a specific computation graph,
Placeto can learn generalizable device placement policies that can be applied
to any graph. We propose two key ideas in our approach: (1) we represent the
policy as performing iterative placement improvements, rather than outputting a
placement in one shot; (2) we use graph embeddings to capture relevant
information about the structure of the computation graph, without relying on
node labels for indexing. These ideas allow Placeto to train efficiently and
generalize to unseen graphs. Our experiments show that Placeto requires up to
6.1x fewer training steps to find placements that are on par with or better
than the best placements found by prior approaches. Moreover, Placeto is able
to learn a generalizable placement policy for any given family of graphs, which
can then be used without any retraining to predict optimized placements for
unseen graphs from the same family. This eliminates the large overhead incurred
by prior RL approaches whose lack of generalizability necessitates re-training
from scratch every time a new graph is to be placed.

However, studies in robot motion control indicate that choosing an action space

with kinematic constraints), and Surface Wiping (task with continuous contact).
We show that VICES improves sample efficiency, maintains low energy

RL policies learned with VICES can transfer across different robot models in

descriptors and the potential energy surface of a system of atoms has emerged
as a new frontier in the development of interatomic potentials (IAPs). Here, we
present a comprehensive evaluation of ML-IAPs based on four local environment
descriptors --- Behler-Parrinello symmetry functions, smooth overlap of atomic
positions (SOAP), the Spectral Neighbor Analysis Potential (SNAP) bispectrum
components, and moment tensors --- using a diverse data set generated using
high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The data set
comprising bcc (Li, Mo) and fcc (Cu, Ni) metals and diamond group IV
semiconductors (Si, Ge) is chosen to span a range of crystal structures and
bonding. All descriptors studied show excellent performance in predicting
energies and forces far surpassing that of classical IAPs, as well as
predicting properties such as elastic constants and phonon dispersion curves.
We observe a general trade-off between accuracy and the degrees of freedom of
each model, and consequently computational cost. We will discuss these
trade-offs in the context of model selection for molecular dynamics and other
applications.

the estimation could be further improved by generating pictures in the game

visual depth and ego-motion estimation: Stacked Generative Adversarial

layer estimates the depth and ego-motion while the higher layers estimate the
spatial features. It can also capture the temporal dynamic due to the use of a
recurrent representation across the layers. See Fig.1 for details. We select
the most commonly used KITTI [1] data set for evaluation. The evaluation

solved exactly by a constant-depth quantum circuit using bounded fan-in gates
(or QNC^0 circuits), but cannot be solved by any constant-depth classical
circuit using bounded fan-in AND, OR, and NOT gates (or NC^0 circuits). In
other words, they exhibited a search problem in QNC^0 that is not in NC^0.
  We strengthen their result by proving that the 2D HLF problem is not
contained in AC^0, the class of classical, polynomial-size, constant-depth
circuits over the gate set of unbounded fan-in AND and OR gates, and NOT gates.
We also supplement this worst-case lower bound with an average-case result:
There exists a simple distribution under which any AC^0 circuit (even of nearly
exponential size) has exponentially small correlation with the 2D HLF problem.
Our results are shown by constructing a new problem in QNC^0, which we call the
Relaxed Parity Halving Problem, which is easier to work with. We prove our AC^0
lower bounds for this problem, and then show that it reduces to the 2D HLF
problem.
  As a step towards even stronger lower bounds, we present a search problem
that we call the Parity Bending Problem, which is in QNC^0/qpoly (QNC^0
circuits that are allowed to start with a quantum state of their choice that is
independent of the input), but is not even in AC^0[2] (the class AC^0 with
unbounded fan-in XOR gates).
  All the quantum circuits in our paper are simple, and the main difficulty
lies in proving the classical lower bounds. For this we employ a host of
techniques, including a refinement of H{\aa}stad's switching lemmas for
multi-output circuits that may be of independent interest, the
Razborov-Smolensky AC^0[2] lower bound, Vazirani's XOR lemma, and lower bounds

that must be addressed with utmost attention. In the recent past, many efforts
have been made toward the possibility of employing local master equations,
which compute the interaction with the environment neglecting the direct

we provide a detailed derivation of the Markovian master equation for two
coupled qubits interacting with common and separate baths, considering pure
dephasing as well as dissipation. Then, we explore the differences between the
local and global master equation, showing that they intrinsically depend on the
way we apply the secular approximation. Our results prove that the global
approach with partial secular approximation always provides the most accurate
choice for the master equation when Born-Markov approximations hold, even for
small inter-system coupling constants. Using different master equations we
compute the stationary heat current between two separate baths, the
entanglement dynamics generated by a common bath, and the emergence of
spontaneous synchronization, showing the importance of the accurate choice of

co-located teams. The last decade has seen the spread of agile into large
scale, distributed and regulated domains. Many case studies show successful
agile adoption in GSD, however, taken as a whole, it remains unclear how
widespread this trend is, and what form the agile adoption takes in a global
software development (GSD) setting.
  Aims: Our objective is to gain a deeper understanding of how organisations
adopt agile development methods in distributed settings. Specifically we aim to
plot the current development process landscape in GSD.
  Method: We analyse industrial survey data from 33 different countries
collected as part of the project that explored the wider use of hybrid
development approaches in software development. We extract and analyse the
results of 263 surveys completed by participants involved in globally
distributed projects.
  Results: In our sample, 72 of globally distributed projects implement a mix
of both agile and traditional approaches (termed `hybrid'). 25 of GSD
organisations are predominantly agile, with only very few (5) opting for
traditional approaches. GSD projects that used only agile methods tended to be
very large.
  Conclusions: Globally Distributed Software Development (and project size) is
not a barrier to adopting agile practices. Yet, to facilitate project
coordination and general project management, many adopt traditional approaches,
resulting in a hybrid approach that follows defined rules.

chromosphere in the optical and millimeter wavelength ranges, obtained with
ALMA and the IBIS instrument at the Dunn Solar Telescope. In this paper we
concentrate on the comparison between the brightness temperature observed in
ALMA Band 3 (3 mm; 100 GHz) and the core width of the H$\alpha$ 656.3 nm line,
previously identified as a possible diagnostic of the chromospheric
temperature. We find that in the area of plage, network and fibrils covered by
our FOV the two diagnostics are well correlated, with similar spatial
structures observed in both. The strength of the correlation is remarkable,
given that the source function of the mm-radiation obeys local thermodynamic
equilibrium, while the H$\alpha$ line has a source function that deviates
significantly from the local Planck function. The observed range of ALMA
brightness temperatures is sensibly smaller than the temperature range that was
previously invoked to explain the observed width variations in H$\alpha$. We
employ analysis from forward modeling with the RH code to argue that the strong
correlation between H$\alpha$ width and ALMA brightness temperature is caused
by their shared dependence on the population number $n_2$ of the first excited
level of hydrogen. This population number drives millimeter opacity through
hydrogen ionization via the Balmer continuum, and H$\alpha$ width through a
curve-of-growth-like opacity effect. Ultimately, the $n_2$ population is
regulated by the enhancement or lack of downward Ly$\alpha$ flux, which
coherently shifts the formation height of both diagnostics to regions with
different temperature, respectively.

tailored for Bayesian optimization. Whilst the current sparse spectrum methods
provide desired approximations for regression problems, it is observed that
this particular form of sparse approximations generates an overconfident GP,
i.e. it produces less epistemic uncertainty than the original GP. Since the
balance between predictive mean and the predictive variance is the key
determinant to the success of Bayesian optimization, the current sparse
spectrum methods are less suitable for it. We derive a new regularized marginal
likelihood for finding the optimal frequencies to fix this over-confidence
issue, particularly for Bayesian optimization. The regularizer trades off the
accuracy in the model fitting with a targeted increase in the predictive
variance of the resultant GP. Specifically, we use the entropy of the global
maximum distribution from the posterior GP as the regularizer that needs to be
maximized. Since this distribution cannot be calculated analytically, we first
propose a Thompson sampling based approach and then a more efficient sequential
Monte Carlo based approach to estimate it. Later, we also show that the
Expected Improvement acquisition function can be used as a proxy for the
maximum distribution, thus making the whole process further efficient.
Experiments show considerable improvement to Bayesian optimization convergence
rate over the vanilla sparse spectrum method and over a full GP when its
covariance matrix is ill-conditioned due to the presence of a large number of

hit-and-run collision; in both cases,<10% of impactor's core materials are
fragmented and finally embedded in the martian mantle. Isotopic evidence from
martian meteorites, and interpretations from atmospheric mapping data show that
a global surface water reservoir could be present during the early Noachian
(before ca. 4100 Ma). The millimeter-sized metal hail could thus react with a
martian hydrosphere to generate ~3 bars of H2, which is adequate to act as a
greenhouse and keep early Mars warm. Yet, we also find that this atmosphere is
transient. It typically survives shorter than 3 Myr based on the expected
extreme ultraviolet (EUV) flux of the early Sun; if the Sun was a slow rotator
an accordingly weaker EUV flux could extend this lifetime to >10 Myr. A dense
pre-Noachian CO2 atmosphere should lower the escape efficiency of hydrogen by
IR emission. A more detailed hydrodynamic atmospheric model of this early
hydrogen atmosphere is warranted to examine its effect on pre-Noachian Mars.

clustering has become very popular these days, which is conventionally called
multi-view clustering. Generally, it is essential to measure the importance of
each individual view, due to some noises, or inherent capacities in
description. Many previous works model the view importance as weight, which is
simple but effective empirically. In this paper, instead of following the
traditional thoughts, we propose a new weight learning paradigm in context of
multi-view clustering in virtue of the idea of re-weighted approach, and we
theoretically analyze its working mechanism. Meanwhile, as a carefully achieved
example, all of the views are connected by exploring a unified Laplacian rank
constrained graph, which will be a representative method to compare with other
weight learning approaches in experiments. Furthermore, the proposed weight
learning strategy is much suitable for multi-view data, and it can be naturally
integrated with many existing clustering learners. According to the numerical
experiments, the proposed intrinsic weight learning approach is proved
effective and practical to use in multi-view clustering.

to estimate the photometric redshifts of quasars. Our schemes are based on the
idea that the samples are firstly classified into subsamples by a classifier
and then photometric redshift estimation of different subsamples is performed
by a regressor. Random Forest is adopted as the core algorithm of the
classifiers, while Random Forest and kNN are applied as the key algorithms of
regressors. The samples are divided into two subsamples and four subsamples
depending on the redshift distribution. The performance based on different
samples, different algorithms and different schemes are compared. The
experimental results indicate that the accuracy of photometric redshift
estimation for the two schemes generally improve to some extent compared to the
original scheme in terms of the percents in \frac{|\Delta z|}{1+z_{i}}<0.1 and
\frac{|\Delta z|}{1+z_{i}}<0.2 and mean absolute error. Only given the running
speed, kNN shows its superiority to Random Forest. The performance of Random
Forest is a little better than or comparable to that of kNN with the two
datasets. The accuracy based on the SDSS-WISE sample outperforms that based on
the SDSS sample no matter by kNN or by Random Forest. More information from
more bands is considered and helpful to improve the accuracy of photometric
redshift estimation. Evidently it can be found that our strategy to estimate
photometric redshift is applicable and may be applied to other datasets or
other kinds of objects. Only talking about the percent in \frac{|\Delta

photometric redshift estimation.

  Quantify Impact of Construction Projects on Emergency Response in Urban
  Settings",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Continuous construction and rehabilitation in urban settings have unavoidable
impacts on arrival times of first responders to emergency locations. Current
research efforts on emergency response assessments focus on case studies, where
specific periods (e.g., super storm Sandy) of emergency response times are
analyzed. Simulation based studies that aim to evaluate response times in
relation to various constraints/fleet sizes also exist. However, they do not
analyze how specific changes (e.g., new and ongoing construction projects) in
urban settings impact emergency response times of first responders. This paper
aims to fill the gap and proposes a novel approach to predict the expected
emergency response time for a given location using the fabric of zones
regarding construction activities. This approach relies on historical records
of emergency response and construction permits issued by city agencies. The
approach first defines the signature of a zone (by zip codes) for construction
activities based on the distribution of historical construction work types
permitted in that zone over time. Then, zones that share similar signatures are
clustered to find if there exists a relationship between construction
signatures and emergency response times. Next, supervised learning algorithms
are deployed to predict the average emergency response times for each cluster.
The approach was tested using New York City's construction permit and emergency
response records, and can be easily replicated for other cities with similar
public datasets. This study serves as the first step towards quantitatively
understanding construction projects' impact on a quality of life (QoL)
indicator (specifically emergency response times) in urban settings.

by radioactive decays of freshly synthesized r-process nuclei. Although
observational properties are largely affected by bound-bound opacities of
r-process elements, available atomic data have been limited. In this paper, we
study element-to-element variation of the opacities in the ejecta of neutron
star mergers by performing systematic atomic structure calculations of
r-process elements for the first time. We show that the distributions of energy
levels tend to be higher as electron occupation increases for each electron
shell due to the larger energy spacing caused by larger effects of spin-orbit
and electron-electron interactions. As a result, elements with a fewer number
of electrons in the outermost shells tend to give larger contributions to the
bound-bound opacities. This implies that Fe is not representative for the
opacities of light r-process elements. The average opacities for the mixture of
r-process elements are found to be kappa ~ 20-30 cm^2 g^{-1} for the electron
fraction of Ye < 0.20, kappa ~ 3-5 cm^2 g^{-1} for Ye = 0.25-0.35, and kappa ~
1 cm^2 g^{-1} for Ye = 0.40 at T = 5,000-10,000 K, and they steeply decrease at

opacity in the ejecta changes with time by one order of magnitude from 1 to 10
days after the merger. Our radiative transfer simulations with the new opacity

cloud that screens the impurity spin. This basic phenomenon is called the Kondo
effect. Contrary to electric charge screening, the spin screening cloud occurs
quantum coherently, forming spin-singlet entanglement with the impurity.
Although the spins interact locally around the impurity, the cloud can spread
out over micrometers. The Kondo cloud has never been detected to date, and its
existence, a fundamental aspect of the Kondo effect, remains as a long-standing
controversial issue. Here we present experimental evidence of a Kondo cloud
extending over a length of micrometers comparable to the theoretical length
$\xi_\mathrm{K}$. In our device, a Kondo impurity is formed in a quantum dot
(QD), one-sided coupling to a quasi-one dimensional
channel~\cite{Theory_Proposal_HS} that houses a Fabry-Perot (FP) interferometer
of various gate-defined lengths $L > 1 \, \mu$m. When we sweep a voltage on the
interferometer end gate separated from the QD by the length $L$ to induce FP
oscillations in conductance, we observe oscillations in measured Kondo
temperature $T_\mathrm{K}$, a sign of the cloud at distance $L$. For $L
\lesssim \xi_\mathrm{K}$ the $T_\mathrm{K}$ oscillation amplitude becomes
larger for the smaller $L$, obeying a scaling function of a single parameter
$L/ \xi_\mathrm{K}$, while for $L>\xi_\mathrm{K}$ the oscillation is much
weaker. The result reveals that $\xi_\mathrm{K}$ is the only length parameter
associated with the Kondo effect, and that the cloud lies mostly inside the
length $\xi_\mathrm{K}$ which reaches microns. Our experimental method of using
electron interferometers offers a way of detecting the spatial distribution of
exotic non-Fermi liquids formed by multiple magnetic impurities or multiple
screening channels and solving long-standing issues of spin-correlated systems.

interprets the solution process generated by our numerical schemes as a Markov

the convergence analysis of our method in computing long time solutions. Most
importantly our convergence analysis reveals the connection of discrete-type

autonomous robots. Current approaches to this problem include inverse
reinforcement learning (IRL), which uses expert demonstrations, and
preference-based learning, which iteratively queries the user for her
preferences between trajectories. In robotics however, IRL often struggles
because it is difficult to get high-quality demonstrations; conversely,
preference-based learning is very inefficient since it attempts to learn a
continuous, high-dimensional function from binary feedback. We propose a new
framework for reward learning, DemPref, that uses both demonstrations and
preference queries to learn a reward function. Specifically, we (1) use the
demonstrations to learn a coarse prior over the space of reward functions, to
reduce the effective size of the space from which queries are generated; and
(2) use the demonstrations to ground the (active) query generation process, to
improve the quality of the generated queries. Our method alleviates the
efficiency issues faced by standard preference-based learning methods and does
not exclusively depend on (possibly low-quality) demonstrations. In numerical
experiments, we find that DemPref is significantly more efficient than a
standard active preference-based learning method. In a user study, we compare
our method to a standard IRL method; we find that users rated the robot trained
with DemPref as being more successful at learning their desired behavior, and
preferred to use the DemPref system (over IRL) to train the robot.

pairs that have relation and then assign a correct relation class. However, the
number of non-relation entity pairs in context (negative instances) usually far
exceeds the others (positive instances), which negatively affects a model's
performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose a multi-task architecture
which jointly trains a model to perform relation identification with
cross-entropy loss and relation classification with ranking loss. Meanwhile, we
observe that a sentence may have multiple entities and relation mentions, and
the patterns in which the entities appear in a sentence may contain useful
semantic information that can be utilized to distinguish between positive and
negative instances. Thus we further incorporate the embeddings of
character-wise/word-wise BIO tag from the named entity recognition task into
character/word embeddings to enrich the input representation. Experiment
results show that our proposed approach can significantly improve the
performance of a baseline model with more than 10% absolute increase in

high velocity. Motivated by the recent discovery of fast-moving objects that
occupy unusual locations on the HR diagram, we explore the impact of the
thermonuclear supernovae on the donors in this specific double detonation
scenario. We use MESA to model the binary up to the moment of detonation, then
3D Athena++ to model the hydrodynamic interaction of the supernova ejecta with
the donor star, calculating the amount of mass that is stripped and the entropy
deposited in the deep stellar interior by the strong shock that traverses it.
We show that these donor remnants are ejected with velocities primarily set by
their orbital speeds: $700-900\ \rm km\ s^{-1}$. We model the long-term thermal
evolution of remnants by introducing the shock entropy into MESA models. In
response to this entropy change, donor remnants expand and brighten for
timescales ranging from $10^6-10^8$ years, giving ample time for these runaway
stars to be observed in their inflated state before they leave the galaxy. Even
after surface layers are stripped, some donors retain enough mass to resume

the world is changing throughout the text, and despite recent advances, current
systems still struggle with this task. Our approach is to leverage the fact
that, for many procedural texts, multiple independent descriptions are readily
available, and that predictions from them should be consistent (label
consistency). We present a new learning framework that leverages label
consistency during training, allowing consistency bias to be built into the
model. Evaluation on a standard benchmark dataset for procedural text, ProPara
(Dalvi et al., 2018), shows that our approach significantly improves prediction
performance (F1) over prior state-of-the-art systems.

shows that the optimal variational error of a depth-$\mathrm{P}$ quantum

special {\em regular} optimal solution, which is computationally optimal and
does not require any prior knowledge about the spectral gap. We explicitly
demonstrate here that such a schedule is adiabatic, in a digitized sense, and
can therefore be interpreted as an optimized digitized-QA protocol. We also

design the intensity of our point process model as a mixture of kernels, where
the mixture weights are modeled by a deep neural network. This formulation
allows us to automatically learn the complex nonlinear effects of the
contextual factors on event occurrence. At the same time, this formulation
makes analytical integration over the intensity, which is required for point
process estimation, tractable. We use real-world data sets from different
domains to demonstrate that DMPP has better predictive performance than
existing methods.

scalar coupling $Q$ with matter works to change the star radius in comparison
to General Relativity, while the maximum allowed mass of neutron stars is
hardly modified for both SLy and FPS equations of state. In Brans-Dicke theory
with the massive potential $V(\phi)=m^2 \phi^2/2$, where $m^2$ is a positive

stable field profile due to the existence of an exponentially growing mode
outside the star. As in $f(R)$ gravity with the $R^2$ term, this property is
related to the requirement of extra boundary conditions of the field at the

this problem can be circumvented by the fact that the second derivative
$V_{,\phi \phi}=3\lambda\phi^2$ approaches 0 at spatial infinity. In this case,

decreasing the strength of the side channels as measured by entropy-based

leaks while guaranteeing a user-specified maximal acceptable performance
overhead. We dub the decision version of this problem Shannon mitigation, and
consider two variants, deterministic and stochastic. First, we show the
deterministic variant is NP-hard. However, we give a polynomial algorithm that
finds an optimal solution from a restricted set. Second, for the stochastic
variant, we develop an algorithm that uses optimization techniques specific to
the entropy-based objective used. For instance, for min-guess entropy, we used
mixed integer-linear programming. We apply the algorithm to a threat model
where the attacker gets to make functional observations, that is, where she
observes the running time of the program for the same secret value combined
with different public input values. Existing mitigation approaches do not give
confidentiality or performance guarantees for this threat model. We evaluate
our tool SCHMIT on a number of micro-benchmarks and real-world applications
with different entropy-based objectives. In contrast to the existing mitigation
approaches, we show that in the functional-observation threat model, SCHMIT is
scalable and able to maximize confidentiality under the performance overhead

solutions which generalize the standard boson stars by allowing a particular
superposition of scalar fields in which each of the fields is characterized by
a fixed value of its non-vanishing angular momentum number $\ell$. We call such
solutions ""$\ell$-boson stars"". Here, we perform a series of fully non-linear
dynamical simulations of perturbed $\ell$-boson stars in order to study their
stability, and the final fate of unstable configurations. We show that for each
value of $\ell$, the configuration of maximum mass separates the parameter
space into stable and unstable regions. Stable configurations, when perturbed,
oscillate around the unperturbed solution and very slowly return to a
stationary configuration. Unstable configurations, in contrast, can have three
different final states: collapse to a black hole, migration to the stable
branch, or explosion (dissipation) to infinity. Just as it happens with
$\ell=0$ boson stars, migration to the stable branch or dissipation to infinity
depends on the sign of the total binding energy of the star: bound unstable
stars collapse to black holes or migrate to the stable branch, whereas unbound
unstable stars either collapse to a black hole or explode to infinity. Thus,
the parameter $\ell$ allows us to construct a new set of stable configurations.
All our simulations are performed in spherical symmetry, leaving a more

substrate on which they are cultured: they assume small, rounded shapes in soft
ECMs, they elongate within stiffer ECMs, and flatten out on hard substrates.
Cells tend to prefer stiffer parts of the substrate, a phenomenon known as
durotaxis. Such mechanosensitive responses to ECM mechanics are key to
understanding the regulation of biological tissues by mechanical cues, as it
occurs, e.g., during angiogenesis and the alignment of cells in muscles and
tendons. Although it is well established that the mechanical cell-ECM
interactions are mediated by focal adhesions, the mechanosensitive molecular
complexes linking the cytoskeleton to the substrate, it is poorly understood
how the stiffness-dependent kinetics of the focal adhesions eventually produce
the observed interdependence of substrate stiffness and cell shape and cell
behavior. Here we show that the mechanosensitive behavior of single-focal
adhesions, cell contractility and substrate adhesivity together suffice to
explain the observed stiffness-dependent behavior of cells. We introduce a
multiscale computational model that is based upon the following assumptions:
(1) cells apply forces onto the substrate through FAs; (2) the FAs grow and
stabilize due to these forces; (3) within a given time-interval, the force that
the FAs experience is lower on soft substrates than on stiffer substrates due
to the time it takes to reach mechanical equilibrium; and (4) smaller FAs are
pulled from the substrate more easily than larger FAs. Our model combines the
cellular Potts model for the cells with a finite-element model for the
substrate, and describes each FA using differential equations. Together these
assumptions provide a unifying model for cell spreading, cell elongation and
durotaxis in response to substrate mechanics.

synthesizes a high resolution image by adding together several lower resolution

which can further reduce array costs. To limit the image acquisition time, we
formulate an optimization problem for minimizing the number of component

predict the F0 and spectral features of singing voice in order to better
describe the dependencies among the acoustic features of consecutive frames.
For F0 modeling, discretized F0 values are used and the influences of the
history length in DAR are analyzed by experiments. An F0 post-processing
strategy is also designed to alleviate the inconsistency between the predicted
F0 contours and the F0 values determined by music notes. Furthermore, we extend
the DAR model to deal with continuous spectral features, and a prenet module
with self-attention layers is introduced to process historical frames.
Experiments on a Chinese singing voice corpus demonstrate that our method using

formation of a primordial black hole is an extremely rare event. We also show
that, from the point of view of mass distribution, broad and narrow spectra

conductive filament either during electroforming or from current bifurcation
due to the super-linear temperature dependence of the film conductivity. The
snap-back response then arises from current redistribution between regions of
low and high current-density due to the rapid increase in conductivity created
within the high current density region. This redistribution is further shown to
depend on the relative resistance of the low current-density region with the
characteristics of NbOx cross-point devices transitioning between continuous

binary inspiral, with the tidal deformability of the supranuclear density
matter leaving an imprint on the gravitational-wave signal. As demonstrated in
the case of GW170817, this leads to a constraint on the neutron star radius
(and hence the equation of state). A deeper understanding of the tidal response
requires an analysis of both the state and composition of matter. While these
aspects may not have dramatic impact, they could lead to systematic effects
that need to be kept in mind as the observational data become more precise. As
a step in this direction we explore the role of the composition of matter,
which is likely to remain ""frozen"" during the late stages of binary inspiral.
We provide the first in-depth analysis of the problem, including estimates of
how composition impacts on the effective tidal deformability. The results
provide improved insight into how aspects of physics that tend to be ""ignored""
impact on binary neutron star gravitational-wave signals.

low-latency communication that places constraints on the computational
complexity of channel decoders. 5G low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes have
the so-called protograph-based raptor-like (PBRL) structure which offers
inherent rate-compatibility and excellent performance. Practical LDPC decoder
implementations use message-passing decoding with finite precision, which
becomes coarse as complexity is more severely constrained. Performance degrades
as the precision becomes more coarse. Recently, the information bottleneck (IB)
method was used to design mutual-information-maximizing lookup tables that
replace conventional finite-precision node computations. Additionally, the IB
approach exchanges messages represented by integers with very small bit width.
This paper extends the IB principle to the flexible class of PBRL LDPC codes as
standardized in 5G. The extensions includes puncturing and rate-compatible IB
decoder design. As an example of the new approach, a 4-bit information
bottleneck decoder is evaluated for PBRL LDPC codes over a typical range of
rates. Bit error rate simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms
offset min-sum decoding algorithms and operates within 0.2 dB of
double-precision sum-product belief propagation decoding.

recently observed trade-offs caused by Gaussian data augmentation and

robustness to corruptions that are concentrated in the low frequency domain.
This suggests that one way to mitigate these trade-offs via data augmentation

instances of the task, including various object arrangements in the scene as
well as variations in object geometry, texture, material, and environmental
illumination.
  In this paper, we propose a method that learns to perform table-top instance
grasping of a wide variety of objects while using no real world grasping data,
outperforming the baseline using 2.5D shape by 10%. Our method learns 3D point
cloud of object, and use that to train a domain-invariant grasping policy. We
formulate the learning process as a two-step procedure: 1) Learning a
domain-invariant 3D shape representation of objects from about 76K episodes in
simulation and about 530 episodes in the real world, where each episode lasts
less than a minute and 2) Learning a critic grasping policy in simulation only
based on the 3D shape representation from step 1. Our real world data
collection in step 1 is both cheaper and faster compared to existing approaches
as it only requires taking multiple snapshots of the scene using a RGBD camera.
Finally, the learned 3D representation is not specific to grasping, and can
potentially be used in other interaction tasks.

a curious property of the two-dimensional Hubbard model (and related theories)
with hole doping: the presence of close-in-energy competing ground states that
display very different physical properties. On the one hand, there is a
complicated state exhibiting intertwined spin, charge, and pair density wave
orders. We call this `type A'. On the other hand, there is a uniform d-wave
superconducting state that we denote as `type B'. We advocate, with the support
of both microscopic theoretical calculations and experimental data, dividing
the high-temperature cuprate superconductors into two corresponding families,
whose properties reflect either the type A or type B ground states at low
temperatures. We review the anomalous properties of the pseudogap phase that
led us to this picture, and present a modern perspective on the role that
umklapp scattering plays in these phenomena in the type B materials. This
reflects a consistent framework that has emerged over the last decade, in which
Mott correlations at weak coupling drive the formation of the pseudogap. We
discuss this development, recent theory and experiments, and open issues.

fixed, curved spacetime background. Such a description is valid only if the
spatial volume of the region considered is so large that its size and shape
moduli behave classically. However, if we trace an inflating universe back to
early times, the volume of any comoving region of interest -- for example the
present Hubble volume -- becomes exponentially small. Hence, quantum
fluctuations in the trajectory of the background cannot be neglected at early
times. In this paper, we develop a path integral description of a flat,
inflating patch (approximated as de Sitter spacetime), treating both the
background scale factor and the gravitational wave perturbations quantum
mechanically. We find this description fails at small values of the initial
scale factor, because \emph{two} background saddle point solutions contribute
to the path integral. This leads to a breakdown of QFT in curved spacetime,
causing the fluctuations to be unstable and out of control. We show the problem
may be alleviated by a careful choice of quantum initial conditions, for the
background and the fluctuations, provided that the volume of the initial,
inflating patch is larger than $\gg H^{-1}$ in Planck units with $H$ the Hubble
constant at the start of inflation. The price of the remedy is high: not only
the inflating background, but also the stable, Bunch-Davies fluctuations must
be input by hand. Our discussion emphasizes that, even if the inflationary
scale is far below the Planck mass, new physics is required to explain the
initial quantum state of the universe.

important task for both researchers and practitioners. Previous methods mainly
leverage demographics, temporal and structural patterns of early adopters for
popularity prediction. However, most existing methods are less effective to
precisely capture the cascading effect in information diffusion, in which early
adopters try to activate potential users along the underlying network. In this
paper, we consider the problem of network-aware popularity prediction,
leveraging both early adopters and social networks for popularity prediction.
We propose to capture the cascading effect explicitly, modeling the activation
state of a target user given the activation state and influence of his/her
neighbors. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel method, namely CoupledGNN,
which uses two coupled graph neural networks to capture the interplay between
node activation states and the spread of influence. By stacking graph neural
network layers, our proposed method naturally captures the cascading effect
along the network in a successive manner. Experiments conducted on both
synthetic and real-world Sina Weibo datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for popularity

Jaisson\&Rosenbaum \cite{JR16} in the small-time, large-time and $\alpha \to

qualitatively the same way as a general rough stochastic volatility model (cf.\
\cite{FZ17}, \cite{FGP18a} et al.), and the rate function is equal to the
Fenchel-Legendre transform of a simple transformation of the solution to the
same Volterra integral equation (VIE) that appears in \cite{ER19}, but with the
drift and mean reversion terms removed. The solution to this VIE satisfies a
space-time scaling property which means we only need to solve this equation for
the moment values of $p=1$ and $p=-1$ so the rate function can be efficiently
computed using an Adams scheme or a power series, and we compute a power series
in the log-moneyness variable for the asymptotic implied volatility which
yields tractable expressions for the implied vol skew and convexity. The
limiting asymptotic smile in the large-maturity regime is obtained via a
stability analysis of the fixed points of the VIE, and is the same as for the
standard Heston model in \cite{FJ11}. Finally, using L\'{e}vy's convergence
theorem, we show that the log stock price $X_t$ tends weakly to a non-symmetric
random variable $X^{(1/2)}_t$ as $\alpha \to 1/2$ (i.e. $H\to 0$) whose mgf is
also the solution to the Rough Heston VIE with $\alpha=1/2$, and we show that
$X^{(1/2)}_t/\sqrt{t}$ tends weakly to a non-symmetric random variable as $t\to
0$, which leads to a non-flat non-symmetric asymptotic smile in the Edgeworth
regime. We also show that the third moment of the log stock price tends to a
finite constant as $H\to 0$ (in contrast to the Rough Bergomi model discussed
in \cite{FFGS20} where the skew flattens or blows up) and the $V$ process

addressed in Bayesian RL recently where some approximation techniques have been
developed to find suboptimal policies. While existing approaches mainly focus
on approximating the value function, or on involving Thompson sampling, we

optimal policy directly, by combining the time-decomposition based dynamic

revised progressive hedging algorithm (PHA) at the upper layer, for a type of
Bayesian RL problem. The key feature of our approach is to separate reducible
system uncertainty from irreducible one at two different layers, thus
decomposing and conquering. We demonstrate our solution framework more
especially via the linear-quadratic-Gaussian problem with unknown gain, which,
although seemingly simple, has been a notorious subject over more than half

the deterministic HOTRG method in the clock models is noted by the extreme
vulnerability of the numerical leading zero identification against stochastic

characterize the system-size dependence of the numerical vulnerability of the

transitions in the clock models are not of an ordinary first- or second-order

find that their FSS behaviors show excellent agreement with our predictions of
the logarithmic corrections to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless ansatz at

three major aspects, i.e., accuracy, energy consumption and computational
complexity. In the literature, the latter two aspects have not received much
attention compared to the accuracy of WSN time synchronization. Especially in
multi-hop WSNs, intermediate gateway nodes are overloaded with tasks for not
only relaying messages but also a variety of computations for their offspring
nodes as well as themselves. Therefore, not only minimizing the energy
consumption but also lowering the computational complexity while maintaining
the synchronization accuracy is crucial to the design of time synchronization
schemes for resource-constrained sensor nodes. In this paper, focusing on the
three aspects of WSN time synchronization, we introduce a framework of reverse
asymmetric time synchronization for resource-constrained multi-hop WSNs and
propose a beaconless energy-efficient time synchronization scheme based on
reverse one-way message dissemination. Experimental results with a WSN testbed
based on TelosB motes running TinyOS demonstrate that the proposed scheme
conserves up to 95% energy consumption compared to the flooding time

function has recently been determined by Hwang et al. (2018) up to additive
errors of $O((\log n)/n)$. The same approach proposed there also leads to a
full asymptotic expansion with errors of the form $O(n^{-K}\log n)$ for any
$K>0$. This precise result is obtained by matched asymptotics with rigorous
error analysis (or by solving asymptotically the underlying recurrences via
inductive approximation arguments), ideas radically different from
well-established techniques for the running time analysis of evolutionary
computation such as drift analysis. This paper revisits drift analysis for the
(1+1) EA on OneMax and obtains that the expected running time $E(T)$, starting
from $\lceil n/2\rceil$ one-bits, is determined by the sum of inverse drifts up
to logarithmic error terms, more precisely $$\sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor
n/2\rfloor}\frac{1}{\Delta(k)} - c_1\log n \le E(T) \le \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor
n/2\rfloor}\frac{1}{\Delta(k)} - c_2\log n,$$ where $\Delta(k)$ is the drift
(expected increase of the number of one-bits from the state of $n-k$ ones) and
$c_1,c_2 >0$ are explicitly computed constants. This improves the previous
asymptotic error known for the sum of inverse drifts from $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$
to a logarithmic error and gives for the first time a non-asymptotic error
bound. Using standard asymptotic techniques, the difference between $E(T)$ and
the sum of inverse drifts is found to be $(e/2)\log n+O(1)$.

the fairness properties of algorithms. The trade-offs between fairness and
utilization have a long history in this domain. A recent line of work has
considered fairness questions for resource allocation when the demands for the
resource are distributed across multiple groups and drawn from probability
distributions. In such cases, a natural fairness requirement is that
individuals from different groups should have (approximately) equal
probabilities of receiving the resource. A largely open question in this area
has been to bound the gap between the maximum possible utilization of the
resource and the maximum possible utilization subject to this fairness
condition.
  Here, we obtain some of the first provable upper bounds on this gap. We
obtain an upper bound for arbitrary distributions, as well as much stronger
upper bounds for specific families of distributions that are typically used to
model levels of demand. In particular, we find - somewhat surprisingly - that
there are natural families of distributions (including Exponential and Weibull)
for which the gap is non-existent: it is possible to simultaneously achieve
maximum utilization and the given notion of fairness. Finally, we show that for
power-law distributions, there is a non-trivial gap between the solutions, but
this gap can be bounded by a constant factor independent of the parameters of
the distribution.

The process consists of several
random events among which the reinitiation of transcription by RNAP is an
important one. The RNAP molecules can bind the gene only after the promoter
gets activated by transcription factors. Several transcription factors bind the
promoter to put the gene in the active state. The gene turns into inactive
state as the bound transcription factors leave the promoter. During the active
period of the gene, many RNAP molecules transcribe the gene to synthesize the
mRNAs. The binding event of RNAP to the active state of the gene is a
probabilistic process and therefore, introduces noise or fluctuations in the
mRNA and protein levels. In this paper, we analytically calculate the Fano
factor in mRNA and protein levels and also the probability distribution of mRNA
numbers exactly with the binding event of RNAPs in gene transcription process.
The analytically calculated expression of Fano factor of proteins shows
excellent agreement with an experimental result. Then we show that the Fano
factor in mRNA levels can be sub-Poissonian due to the reinitiation of
transcription by RNAP and the mean mRNA level can be increased without
increasing the Fano factor. Our study show that the Fano factor can also be
reduced keeping mRNA levels fixed. We find that the reinitiation of
transcription can behave as a fine-tuned control process to regulate the
mRNA/protein level in the cell.

understanding of Jupiter's internal dynamics. The gravity data constrain the
depth of the zonal flows observed at cloud level and suggest that they slow
down considerably at a depth of about $0.96\,r_J$, where $r_J$ is the mean
radius at the one bar level. Juno's magnetometer reveals the planet's internal
magnetic field. We combine the new zonal flow and magnetic field models with an
updated electrical conductivity profile to assess the zonal wind induced dynamo
action, concentrating on the outer part of Jupiter's molecular hydrogen region
where the conductivity increases very rapidly with depth. Dynamo action remains
quasi-stationary and can thus reasonably be estimated where the magnetic
Reynolds number remains smaller than one, which is roughly the region above
$0.96\,r_J$. We calculate that the locally induced radial magnetic field
reaches rms values of about $10^{-6}\,$T in this region and may just be
detectable by the Juno mission. Very localized dynamo action and a distinct
pattern that reflects the zonal wind system increases the chance to disentangle
this locally induced field from the background field. The estimates of the
locally induced currents also allow calculating the zonal flow related Ohmic
heating and associated entropy production. The respective quantities remain
below new revised predictions for the total dissipative heating and total
entropy production in Jupiter for any of the explored model combinations. Thus
neither Ohmic heating nor entropy production offer additional constraints on
the depth of the zonal winds.

  Governed by the Obstacle Problem",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is concerned with second-order optimality conditions for Tikhonov
regularized optimal control problems governed by the obstacle problem. Using a
simple observation that allows to characterize the structure of optimal
controls on the active set, we derive various conditions that guarantee the
local/global optimality of first-order stationary points and/or the
local/global quadratic growth of the reduced objective function. Our analysis
extends and refines existing results from the literature, and also covers those
situations where the problem at hand involves additional box-constraints on the
control. As a byproduct, our approach shows in particular that Tikhonov
regularized optimal control problems for the obstacle problem can be
reformulated as state-constrained optimal control problems for the Poisson
equation, and that problems involving a subharmonic obstacle and a convex
objective function are uniquely solvable. The paper concludes with three
counterexamples which illustrate that rather peculiar effects can occur in the
analysis of second-order optimality conditions for optimal control problems
governed by the obstacle problem, and that necessary second-order conditions
for such problems may be hard to derive.

information science. Standard coherence distillation and dilution problems have
been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we introduce and study the problem of
one-shot coherence distillation with catalysts. In order to distill more
coherence from a state of interest, a catalytic system can be involved and a
jointly free operation is applied to both systems. The joint output state
should be a maximally coherent state in tensor product with the unchanged
catalysts, with some allowable fidelity error. We consider several different
definitions of this problem. Firstly, with a small fidelity error in both
systems, we show that, even via the smallest free operation class (PIO), the
distillable coherence of any state with no restriction on the catalysts is
infinite, which is a ""coherence embezzling phenomenon"". We then define and
calculate a lower bound for the distillable coherence when the dimension of
catalysts is restricted. Finally, in consideration of physical relevance, we
define the ""perfect catalysts"" scenario where the catalysts are required to be
pure and precisely unchanged. Interestingly, we show that in this setting
catalysts basically provide no advantages in pure state distillation via IO and
SIO under certain smoothing restriction. Our work enhances the understanding of
catalytic effect in quantum resource theory.

due to its computational efficiency and favorable generalization properties.
Recently, it has been empirically demonstrated that the gradient noise in
several deep learning settings admits a non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed behavior.
This suggests that the gradient noise can be modeled by using $\alpha$-stable
distributions, a family of heavy-tailed distributions that appear in the
generalized central limit theorem. In this context, SGD can be viewed as a
discretization of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by a L\'{e}vy
motion, and the metastability results for this SDE can then be used for
illuminating the behavior of SGD, especially in terms of `preferring wide
minima'. While this approach brings a new perspective for analyzing SGD, it is
limited in the sense that, due to the time discretization, SGD might admit a
significantly different behavior than its continuous-time limit. Intuitively,
the behaviors of these two systems are expected to be similar to each other
only when the discretization step is sufficiently small; however, to the best
of our knowledge, there is no theoretical understanding on how small the
step-size should be chosen in order to guarantee that the discretized system
inherits the properties of the continuous-time system. In this study, we
provide formal theoretical analysis where we derive explicit conditions for the
step-size such that the metastability behavior of the discrete-time system is
similar to its continuous-time limit. We show that the behaviors of the two
systems are indeed similar for small step-sizes and we identify how the error
depends on the algorithm and problem parameters. We illustrate our results with

proposing novel metrics to single out the effect of the network dynamics from

approach to gauge the strength of the echo chamber effect over time. We define
a measure of opinion coherence in the network showing how the echo chamber
becomes weaker across the observed period. The analysis of the hashtags
diffusion in the network shows that this is due to the increase of social
interactions between users with opposite opinions. Finally, the analysis of the
mutual entropy between the opinions expressed and received by the users permits
to quantify the social contagion effect. We find empirical evidence that the
polarization of the users and the dynamics of their interactions may evolve
independently. Our findings may be of interest to the broad array of

antivirus tools can be used to identify infected clients in retrospect.
Domains, by contrast, have to be labeled individually after forensic analysis.
We explore transfer learning based on sluice networks; this allows the
detection models to bootstrap each other. In a large-scale experimental study,
we find that the model outperforms known reference models and detects
previously unknown malware, previously unknown malware families, and previously
unknown malicious domains.

higher risk of infection even in populations where HIV prevalence is moderate
or low. Alongside condom use, Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective
tool for sex workers to reduce their risk of HIV acquisition. However, PrEP
provides no direct protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
other than HIV, unlike condoms. We use an empirical network of sexual contacts
among female sex workers (FSWs) and clients to simulate the spread of HIV and
gonorrhea. We then investigate the effect of PrEP adoption and adherence, on
both HIV and gonorrhea prevalence. We also study the effect of a potential
increase in condomless acts due to lowered risk perception with respect of the
no-PrEP scenario (risk compensation). We find that when HIV is the only disease
circulating, PrEP is effective in reducing HIV prevalence, even with high risk
compensation. Instead, the complex interplay between the two diseases shows
that different levels of risk compensation require different intervention
strategies. Finally, we find that providing PrEP only to the most active FSWs
is less effective than uniform PrEP adoption. Our work shows that the effects
emerging from the complex interactions between these diseases and the available
prophylactic measures need to be accounted for, to devise effective
intervention strategies.

estimation. This task involves numerous evaluations of a computationally
expensive objective function. Surrogate-based optimization introduces a
computationally efficient predictive model that approximates the value of the
objective function. The standard approach involves learning a surrogate from
training examples that correspond to past evaluations of the objective
function. Current surrogate-based optimization methods use static, predefined
substitution strategies that decide when to use the surrogate and when the true
objective. We introduce a meta-model framework where the substitution strategy
is dynamically adapted to the solution space of the given optimization problem.
The meta model encapsulates the objective function, the surrogate model and the
model of the substitution strategy, as well as components for learning them.
The framework can be seamlessly coupled with an arbitrary optimization
algorithm without any modification: it replaces the objective function and
autonomously decides how to evaluate a given candidate solution. We test the
utility of the framework on three tasks of estimating parameters of real-world
models of dynamical systems. The results show that the meta model significantly
improves the efficiency of optimization, reducing the total number of
evaluations of the objective function up to an average of 77%.

Women-headed households are often more prominent in urban settings and they

We find that, taking into account the differences in users' calling behaviors,
women move less than men, visiting less unique locations and distributing their

mobility over the 52 comunas of Santiago, we find a higher mobility gap to be
correlated with socio-economic indicators, such as a lower average income, and
with the lack of public and private transportation options. Such results
provide new insights for policymakers to design more gender inclusive

sets of user requests, requiring an efficient strategy for storing and
retrieving virtual machine images (VMIs) at a large scale. The VMI storage
management require dealing with multiple VMIs, typically in the magnitude of
gigabytes, which entails VMI sprawl issues hindering the elastic resource
management and provisioning. Nevertheless, existing techniques to facilitate
VMI management overlook VMI semantics (i.e at the level of base image and
software packages) with either restricted possibility to identify and extract
reusable functionalities or with higher VMI publish and retrieval overheads. In
this paper, we design, implement and evaluate Expelliarmus, a novel VMI
management system that helps to minimize storage, publish and retrieval
overheads. To achieve this goal, Expelliarmus incorporates three complementary
features. First, it makes use of VMIs modelled as semantic graphs to expedite
the similarity computation between multiple VMIs. Second, Expelliarmus provides
a semantic aware VMI decomposition and base image selection to extract and
store non-redundant base image and software packages. Third, Expelliarmus can
also assemble VMIs based on the required software packages upon user request.
We evaluate Expelliarmus through a representative set of synthetic Cloud VMIs
on the real test-bed. Experimental results show that our semantic-centric
approach is able to optimize repository size by 2.2-16 times compared to
state-of-the-art systems (e.g. IBM's Mirage and Hemera) with significant VMI
publish and slight retrieval performance improvement.

some applications that slows its convergence. Restart schemes seek to improve
the convergence of FGM algorithms by suppressing the oscillatory behaviour.
Recently, a restart scheme for FGM has been proposed that provides linear
convergence for non strongly convex optimization problems that satisfy a
quadratic functional growth condition. However, the proposed algorithm requires
prior knowledge of the optimal value of the objective function or of the
quadratic functional growth parameter. In this paper we present a restart

data sets (including CMB, galaxy redshift surveys, etc.) naturally involves
marginalization, i.e., integration, over an unknown underlying random signal
field. Recently, I showed how a renormalization group method can be used to
carry out this integration efficiently by first integrating out the smallest
scale structure, i.e., localized structure on the scale of differences between
nearby data cells, then combining adjacent cells in a coarse graining step,
then repeating this process over and over until all scales have been
integrated. Here I extend the formulation in several ways in order to reduce
the prefactor on the method's linear scaling with data set size. The key
improvement is showing how to integrate out the difference between specific
adjacent cells before summing them in the coarse graining step, compared to the
original formulation in which small-scale fluctuations were integrated more
generally. I suggest some other improvements in details of the scheme,
including showing how to perform the integration around a maximum likelihood
estimate for the underlying random field. In the end, an accurate likelihood
computation for a million-cell Gaussian test data set runs in two minutes on my
laptop, with room for further optimization and straightforward parallelization.

particular, we focus on the decrease of lithium at high metallicity observed by
the AMBRE Project, the Gaia-ESO Survey, and other spectroscopic surveys, which
still remains unexplained by theoretical models. We analyse the various lithium
producers and confirm that novae are the main source of lithium in the Galaxy,
in agreement with other previous studies. Moreover, we show that, by assuming
that the fraction of binary systems giving rise to novae is lower at higher
metallicity, we can suggest a novel explanation to the lithium decline at
super-solar metallicities: the above assumption is based on independent
constraints on the nova system birthrate, that have been recently proposed in
the literature. As regards to the thick disc, it is less lithium enhanced due
to the shorter timescale of formation and higher star formation efficiency with
respect to the thin disc and, therefore, we have a faster evolution and the
""reverse knee"" in the A(Li) vs. [Fe/H] relation is shifted towards higher
metallicities. Finally, we present our predictions about lithium evolution in

two models characterised by different densities of the external gas. In both

forms a population of extreme SG stars with high helium enhancement, followed
by the formation of another SG group out of a mix of pristine gas and AGB
ejecta and characterised by a modest helium enhancement. On the other hand, the
high-density model forms in prevalence SG stars with modest helium enhancement.
Our simulations illustrate the dynamical processes governing the formation of
SG populations in GCs and shed light on the structural properties emerging at
the end of this phase. The newly born SG groups have different concentrations,
with more extreme SG stars more centrally concentrated than those with less

object the TESLA shaped superconducting cavities, as produced for the European

is explained by the available measurement data that can be leveraged to
substantiate the simulation model. Each step of the manufacturing chain is
documented together with the involved uncertainties. Several of these steps are
mimicked on the simulation side, e.g. by introducing a random eigenvalue
problem. The uncertainties are then quantified numerically and in particular
the sensitivities give valuable insight into the systems behavior. We also
compare these findings to purely statistical studies carried out for the
manufactured cavities. More advanced, adaptive, surrogate modeling techniques
are adopted, which are crucial to incorporate a large number of uncertain
parameters. The main contribution is the detailed comparison and fusion of
measurement results for the EXFEL cavities on the one hand and simulation based
uncertainty studies on the other hand. After introducing the quantities of
physical interest for accelerator cavities and the Maxwell eigenvalue problem,
the details on the manufacturing of the EXFEL cavities and measurements are
reported. This is followed by uncertainty modeling with quantification studies.

intersection of all the parallel strips perpendicular to and bounded by $n$

taking advantage of the VDD principle where main computations are linear

Standard Model calculations and several unfolded differential distributions are
measured. In the $WZ$ channel, the helicities of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons are
probed. Results are interpreted in terms of limits on anomalous gauge couplings
in the framework of effective field theories. Finally, the first evidence for
the production of three massive vector bosons ($WWW$, $WWZ$, $WZZ$) is

analysis methods are not adequate to analyze the microbiome as a mediator due
to the excessive number of zero-valued sequencing reads in the data that is
compounded by its compositional structure. The two main challenges raised by
the zero-inflated data structure are: (a) disentangling the mediation effect
induced by the point mass at zero; and (b) identifying the observed zero-valued
data points that are actually not zero (i.e., false zeros). We develop a novel
marginal mediation analysis method under the potential-outcomes framework to
fill this gap and show the marginal model can also account for the
compositional structure. The mediation effect can be decomposed into two
components that are inherent to the two-part nature of zero-inflated
distributions. With probabilistic models to account for observing zeros, we
also address the challenge with false zeros. A comprehensive simulation study

measurements of $\Lambda$CDM model parameter provided by high- and low-redshift
observations started to be in tension, i.e., the obtained values of such
parameters were shown to be significantly different in a statistical sense.
In~this work we tackle the tension on the value of the Hubble parameter, $H_0$,
and the weighted amplitude of matter fluctuations, $S_8$, obtained from local
or low-redshift measurements and from cosmic microwave background (CMB)
observations. We combine the main approaches previously used in the literature
by extending the cosmological model and accounting for extra systematic
uncertainties. With such analysis we aim at exploring non standard cosmological
models, implying deviation from a cosmological constant driven acceleration of
the Universe expansion, in the presence of additional uncertainties in
measurements. In more detail, we reconstruct the Dark Energy equation of state
as a function of redshift, while we study the impact of type-Ia supernovae
(SNIa) redshift-dependent astrophysical systematic effects on these tensions.
We consider a SNIa intrinsic luminosity dependence on redshift due to the star
formation rate in its environment, or the metallicity of the progenitor. We
find that the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions can be significantly alleviated, or~even
removed, if we account for varying Dark Energy for SNIa and CMB data. However,
the tensions remain when we add baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data into
the analysis, even after the addition of extra SNIa systematic uncertainties.
This points towards the need of either new physics beyond late-time Dark
Energy, or other unaccounted systematic effects (particulary in BAO
measurements), to fully solve the present tensions.

is played by an anomalous tunneling process where condensate elements are
coherently converted into phonon excitations, leading to even-order harmonics
in the AC currents as well as a DC contribution. At low bias, we find
dissipative components obeying Ohm's law, and bias-independent nondissipative
components, in sharp contrast to fermionic superconductors. Analyzing the DC
contribution, we find zero thermopower and Lorenz number at zero temperature, a
breakdown of the bosonic Wiedemann-Franz law. These results highlight
importance of the anomalous tunneling process inherent to charge neutral
superfluids. The consequences could readily be observed in existing cold-atom
transport setups.

correlated random variables: trapped fermions, random matrices and random
walks. In the first part, we show several exact mappings between the ground
state of a trapped Fermi gas and ensembles of random matrix theory. The Fermi
gas is inhomogeneous in the trapping potential and in particular there is a
finite edge beyond which its density vanishes. Going beyond standard
semi-classical techniques (such as local density approximation), we develop a
precise description of the spatial statistics close to the edge. This
description holds for a large universality class of hard edge potentials. We
apply these results to compute the statistics of the position of the fermion
the farthest away from the centre of the trap, the number of fermions in a
given domain (full counting statistics) and the related bipartite entanglement
entropy. Our analysis also provides solutions to open problems of extreme value
statistics in random matrix theory. We obtain for instance a complete
description of the fluctuations of the largest eigenvalue in the complex
Ginibre ensemble. In the second part of the thesis, we study extreme value
questions for random walks. We consider the gap statistics, which requires to
take explicitly into account the discreteness of the process. This question
cannot be solved using the convergence of the process to its continuous
counterpart, the Brownian motion. We obtain explicit analytical results for the
gap statistics of the walk with a Laplace distribution of jumps and provide
numerical evidence suggesting the universality of these results.

characterized by the topological charge $Q=2$, the spatial scale $\lambda$, and
another independent length $d$ that can be interpreted as a separation of two
$Q=1$ skyrmions inside a $Q=2$ topological defect in the background of uniform

DDI in a film having a sufficient number of atomic layers $N_{z}$. The shape of
biskyrmions has been obtained by the numerical minimization of the energy of

continuous control, such as physical control and autonomous driving. However,
it is challenging for a reinforcement model to learn a policy for each task
sequentially due to catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, the model would
forget knowledge it learned in the past when trained on a new task. We consider
this challenge from two perspectives: i) acquiring task-specific skills is
difficult since task information and rewards are not highly related; ii)
learning knowledge from previous experience is difficult in continuous control
domains. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end framework namely Continual
Diversity Adversarial Network (CDAN). We first develop an unsupervised
diversity exploration method to learn task-specific skills using an
unsupervised objective. Then, we propose an adversarial self-correction
mechanism to learn knowledge by exploiting past experience. The two learning
procedures are presumably reciprocal. To evaluate the proposed method, we
propose a new continuous reinforcement learning environment named Continual Ant
Maze (CAM) and a new metric termed Normalized Shorten Distance (NSD). The
experimental results confirm the effectiveness of diversity exploration and
self-correction. It is worthwhile noting that our final result outperforms
baseline by 18.35% in terms of NSD, and 0.61 according to the average reward.

known about how these methods are used in practice. How are algorithmic
assessments built, validated, and examined for bias? In this work, we document
and analyze the claims and practices of companies offering algorithms for
employment assessment. In particular, we identify vendors of algorithmic
pre-employment assessments (i.e., algorithms to screen candidates), document
what they have disclosed about their development and validation procedures, and
evaluate their practices, focusing particularly on efforts to detect and
mitigate bias. Our analysis considers both technical and legal perspectives.
Technically, we consider the various choices vendors make regarding data
collection and prediction targets, and explore the risks and trade-offs that
these choices pose. We also discuss how algorithmic de-biasing techniques
interface with, and create challenges for, antidiscrimination law.

mature techniques that are used in fields of physics ranging from electrical

finite-size effects. Here, we present a novel class of algorithms that, for
certain systems, allows to directly access the thermodynamic limit. Our
approach, based on the Green's function formalism for discrete models, targets
systems which are mostly invariant by translation, i.e. invariant by
translation up to a finite number of orbitals and/or quasi-1D electrodes and/or
the presence of edges or surfaces. Our approach is based on an automatic
calculation of the poles and residues of series expansions of the Green's
function in momentum space. This expansion allows to integrate analytically in
one momentum variable. We illustrate our algorithms with several applications:
devices with graphene electrodes that consist of half an infinite sheet;
Friedel oscillation calculations of infinite 2D systems in presence of an
impurity; quantum spin Hall physics in presence of an edge; the surface of a
Weyl semi-metal in presence of impurities and electrodes connected to the
surface. In this last example, we study the conduction through the Fermi arcs
of the topological material and its resilience to the presence of disorder. Our
approach provides a practical route for simulating 3D bulk systems or surfaces

the pipeline is scaled four-fold, on par with gains from process technology.
However, up to 80% of this upside is unreachable by the best known branch

  New approaches are needed, and machine learning (ML) provides a palette of
powerful predictors. A growing body of work has shown that ML models are

are one way to customize CPUs post-silicon by training to customer

a key factor is the maximum temperature at which the Dirac surface states
dominate the transport behavior. Here, we employ Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations

different vanadium (V) doping levels are insulating in the 3-300 K region, 2)
the SdH oscillations show two-dimensional behavior, indicating that the
oscillations arise from the pure surface states; and 3) at 50 K, the V0.04
single crystals (Vx:Bi1.08-xSn0.02Sb0.9Te2S, where x = 0.04) still show clear

achieving both spectrum and energy efficient wireless communication systems in
the future. However, existing works on IRS mainly consider frequency-flat
channels and assume perfect knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the
transmitter. Motivated by this, in this paper we study an IRS-enhanced
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system under
frequency-selective channels and propose a practical transmission protocol with
channel estimation. First, to reduce the overhead in channel training and
estimation and to exploit the channel spatial correlation, we propose a novel
IRS elements grouping method, where each group consists of a set of adjacent
IRS elements that share a common reflection coefficient. Based on this grouping
method, we propose a practical transmission protocol where only the combined
channel of each group needs to be estimated, thus substantially reducing the
training overhead. Next, with any given grouping and estimated CSI, we
formulate the problem to maximize the achievable rate by jointly optimizing the
transmit power allocation and the IRS passive array reflection coefficients.
Although the formulated problem is non-convex and thus difficult to solve, we
propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution for
it, by alternately optimizing the power allocation and the passive array
coefficients in an iterative manner, along with a customized method for the
initialization. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly
improves the OFDM link rate performance as compared to the case without using
IRS. Moreover, it is shown that there exists an optimal size for IRS elements
grouping which achieves the maximum achievable rate due to the trade-off
between the training overhead and IRS passive beamforming flexibility.

perspective, phoneme and word discovery from multiple speakers is a more

different speakers exhibit different acoustic features. This paper proposes an
unsupervised phoneme and word discovery method that simultaneously uses
nonparametric Bayesian double articulation analyzer (NPB-DAA) and deep sparse
autoencoder with parametric bias in hidden layer (DSAE-PBHL). We assume that an
infant can recognize and distinguish speakers based on certain other features,
e.g., visual face recognition. DSAE-PBHL is aimed to be able to subtract
speaker-dependent acoustic features and extract speaker-independent features.
An experiment demonstrated that DSAE-PBHL can subtract distributed
representations of acoustic signals, enabling extraction based on the types of
phonemes rather than on the speakers. Another experiment demonstrated that a
combination of NPB-DAA and DSAE-PB outperformed the available methods in

In particular, we introduce a space-variant generalization of the TV
regularizer, referred to as TV$_p^{SV}$, where the so-called shape parameter
$p\,$ is automatically and locally estimated by applying a statistical
inference technique based on the generalized Gaussian distribution. The
restored image is efficiently computed by using an alternating direction method
of multipliers procedure. We validated our models on images corrupted by
Gaussian blur and two important types of noise, namely the additive white
Gaussian noise and the impulsive salt and pepper noise. Numerical examples show
that the proposed approach is particularly effective and well suited for images
characterized by a wide range of gradient distributions.

when the neural network is optimized for localization in the current
environmental conditions. In this paper we investigate the concept of feature
map filtering, where, rather than using all the activations within a
convolutional tensor, only the most useful activations are used. Since specific
feature maps encode different visual features, the objective is to remove
feature maps that are detract from the ability to recognize a location across
appearance changes. Our key innovation is to filter the feature maps in an
early convolutional layer, but then continue to run the network and extract a
feature vector using a later layer in the same network. By filtering early
visual features and extracting a feature vector from a higher, more viewpoint
invariant later layer, we demonstrate improved condition and viewpoint
invariance. Our approach requires image pairs for training from the deployment
environment, but we show that state-of-the-art performance can regularly be
achieved with as little as a single training image pair. An exhaustive
experimental analysis is performed to determine the full scope of causality
between early layer filtering and late layer extraction. For validity, we use
three datasets: Oxford RobotCar, Nordland, and Gardens Point, achieving overall
superior performance to NetVLAD. The work provides a number of new avenues for
exploring CNN optimizations, without full re-training.

many fully supervised learning methods for segmenting bioimages that can

introduce a deep convolutional neural network for microscopy image
segmentation. Annotation issues are circumvented by letting the network being
trainable on coarse labels combined with only a very small number of images

Image segmentation is stratified into three connected tasks: rough inner region
detection, object separation and pixel-wise segmentation. These tasks are
learned in an end-to-end multi-task learning framework. The method is
demonstrated on two microscopy datasets, where we show that the model gives
accurate segmentation results even if exact boundary labels are missing for a
majority of annotated data. It brings more flexibility and efficiency for
training deep neural networks that are data hungry and is applicable to
biomedical images with poor contrast at the object boundaries or with diverse

their macroscopic response, all the more when the process is essentially
microscopic as for microstructural degradation processes. However, the MG tends
to be approximated by ideal spherical packings with constitutive description of
the microstructural contacts. Interfaces tracking models like phase-field
modeling (PFM) are promising candidates to capture the microstructures
dynamics. Contact PFM (CPFM) enables to include catalyzing/inhibiting (CI)
effects, accelerating/delaying equilibrium, such as temperature or the presence
of certain constituents. To emphasize the influence of geometry and CI effects,
we study numerically the chemo-mechanical response of digitalized geomaterials
at the grain scale. An application to pressure solution creep (PSC) shows the
importance of the MG and how the influence of temperature and clay can be taken
into account without explicit modeling. As already inferred in previous works
on PSC, the lack of MG considerations could be the reason why a unique
description of PSC is missing. A simple reason could be that PSC is directly
dependent on the strain concentration, which is directly dependent on the MG.
This is our motivation here to investigate and suggest the influence of the MG
on a degradation process like PSC.

on user-item interaction patterns, are a key component of recommendation
systems. In many applications, contextual constraints need to be applied to
refine recommendations, e.g. when a user specifies a price range or product
category filter. The conventional approach, for both context-aware and standard
models, is to retrieve items and apply the constraints as independent
operations. The order in which these two steps are executed can induce
significant problems. For example, applying constraints a posteriori can result
in incomplete recommendations or low-quality results for the tail of the
distribution (i.e., less popular items). As a result, the additional
information that the constraint brings about user intent may not be accurately
captured.
  In this paper we propose integrating the information provided by the
contextual constraint into the similarity computation, by merging constraint
application and retrieval into one operation in the embedding space. This
technique allows us to generate high-quality recommendations for the specified
constraint. Our approach learns constraints representations jointly with the
user and item embeddings. We incorporate our methods into a matrix
factorization model, and perform an experimental evaluation on one internal and
two real-world datasets. Our results show significant improvements in
predictive performance compared to context-aware and standard models.
