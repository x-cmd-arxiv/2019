  Augmentation",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deploying machine learning systems in the real world requires both high
accuracy on clean data and robustness to naturally occurring corruptions. While
architectural advances have led to improved accuracy, building robust models
remains challenging. Prior work has argued that there is an inherent trade-off
between robustness and accuracy, which is exemplified by standard data augment
techniques such as Cutout, which improves clean accuracy but not robustness,
and additive Gaussian noise, which improves robustness but hurts accuracy. To
overcome this trade-off, we introduce Patch Gaussian, a simple augmentation
scheme that adds noise to randomly selected patches in an input image. Models
trained with Patch Gaussian achieve state of the art on the CIFAR-10 and
ImageNetCommon Corruptions benchmarks while also improving accuracy on clean
data. We find that this augmentation leads to reduced sensitivity to high
frequency noise(similar to Gaussian) while retaining the ability to take
advantage of relevant high frequency information in the image (similar to
Cutout). Finally, we show that Patch Gaussian can be used in conjunction with
other regularization methods and data augmentation policies such as
AutoAugment, and improves performance on the COCO object detection benchmark.

in its collapse, with the recorded discrete outcome designating the particular
eigenstate that the qubit collapsed into. We show that this picture breaks down
when the qubit is strongly driven during measurement. More specifically, for a
fast evolving qubit the measurement returns the time-averaged expectation value
of the measurement operator, erasing information about the initial state of the
qubit, while completely suppressing the measurement back-action. We call this
regime `quantum rifling', as the fast spinning of the Bloch vector protects it
from deflection into either of its eigenstates. We study this phenomenon with
two superconducting qubits coupled to the same probe field and demonstrate that
quantum rifling allows us to measure either one of the qubits on demand while
protecting the state of the other from measurement back-action. Our results
allow for the implementation of selective read out multiplexing of several
qubits, contributing to the efficient scaling up of quantum processors for
future quantum technologies.

volatility the IF gain (or loss) caused by a single paper, and this is
inversely proportional to journal size. We find high volatilities for hundreds
of journals annually due to their top-cited paper: whether it is a highly-cited
paper in a small journal, or a moderately (or even low) cited paper in a small
and low-cited journal. For example, 1218 journals had their most cited paper
boost their IF by more than 20%, while for 231 journals the boost exceeded 50%.
We find that small journals are rewarded much more than large journals for
publishing a highly-cited paper, and are also penalized more for publishing a
low-cited paper, especially if they have a high IF. This produces a strong
incentive for prestigious, high-IF journals to stay small, to remain
competitive in IF rankings. We discuss the implications for breakthrough papers
to appear in prestigious journals. We also question the practice of ranking
journals by IF given this uneven reward mechanism.

They are present in leading experimental platforms for quantum computation and

towards rectifying this problem, we prove two new Lieb-Robinson-type bounds
that constrain the time for signaling and scrambling in strongly long-range
interacting systems, for which no tight bounds were previously known. Our first
bound applies to systems mappable to free-particle Hamiltonians with long-range

generic long-range interacting spin Hamiltonians, and leads to a tight lower
bound for the signaling time to extensive subsets of the system for all $\alpha

towards achieving a tight scrambling bound that can prove the long-standing
fast scrambling conjecture.

Kepler field stars, 1647 of which are confirmed planet hosts. When we compare
the galactocentric velocities of planet hosts to those of the entire field star
sample, we observe a statistically significant (KS p-value = $10^{-70}$)
distinction, with planet hosts being apparently slower than field stars by
$\sim$40 km/s. We explore some potential explanations for this difference and
conclude that it is not a consequence of the planet-metallicity relation or
distinctions in the samples' thin/thick disk membership, but rather an artefact
of Kepler's selection function. Non Kepler-host stars that have nearly
identical distances, temperatures, surface gravities, and Kepler magnitudes to
the confirmed planet hosts also have nearly identical velocity distributions.
Using one of these identical non-host samples, we consider that the probability
of a star with velocity $v_{\mathrm{tot}}$ hosting a planet can be described by
an exponential function proportional to $e^{(-v_{\mathrm{tot}}/v_0)}$. Using a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler, we determine that $v_0 > $976 km/s to 99%

  In this paper, a dual process to the coupled Wright-Fisher diffusion is
derived, which contains transition rates corresponding to coalescence and

coalescence and mutation rates correspond to the typical transition rates of
Kingman's coalescent process. The single-locus selection rate not only contains
the single-locus selection parameters in a form that generalises the rates for
an ancestral selection graph, but it also contains the double-selection

pairwise interactions of the coupled Wright-Fisher diffusion.

transforming input information from digital to analogue, the converter can
perform information processing after training the network by selecting control

input layer in the form of current levels of the oscillators and is converted
into a set of non-repeating states of the chimeric synchronization of the

system using out-of-time-ordered correlation (OTOC) functions. The system
consists of a central qubit directly interacting with a set of satellite
qubits, which in turn interact with a second layer of satellite qubits. This
particular topology not only allows convenient preparation and filtering of
multiple quantum coherences between the central qubit and the first layer but
also to engineer scrambling in a controlled manner. Hence, it provides us with
an opportunity to experimentally study scrambling of information localized in
multi-spin correlations via the construction of relevant OTOCs. Since the
measurement of OTOC requires a time evolution, the non-scrambling processes
such as decoherence and certain experimental errors create an ambiguity.
Therefore, the unambiguous quantification of information scrambling requires
suppressing contributions from decoherence to the OTOC dynamics. To this end,
we propose and experimentally demonstrate a constant time protocol which is
able to filter contribution exclusively from information scrambling.

over shallow methods on large and complex datasets. Typically anomaly detection
is treated as an unsupervised learning problem. In practice however, one may
have---in addition to a large set of unlabeled samples---access to a small pool
of labeled samples, e.g. a subset verified by some domain expert as being
normal or anomalous. Semi-supervised approaches to anomaly detection aim to
utilize such labeled samples, but most proposed methods are limited to merely
including labeled normal samples. Only a few methods take advantage of labeled
anomalies, with existing deep approaches being domain-specific. In this work we
present Deep SAD, an end-to-end deep methodology for general semi-supervised
anomaly detection. We further introduce an information-theoretic framework for
deep anomaly detection based on the idea that the entropy of the latent
distribution for normal data should be lower than the entropy of the anomalous
distribution, which can serve as a theoretical interpretation for our method.
In extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, along with
other anomaly detection benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method is
on par or outperforms shallow, hybrid, and deep competitors, yielding
appreciable performance improvements even when provided with only little

superconductivity: quest achieved, at the cost of supplying 1.5-2 megabars of
pressure. Predictions of numerous high temperature superconducting metal
hydrides $XH_n$ ($X$=metal) have appeared, but are providing limited
understanding of what drives the high transition temperature T$_c$, or what
limits T$_c$. We apply an opportunistic atomic decomposition of the coupling
function to show, first, that the $X$ atom provides coupling strength as
commonly calculated, but is it irrelevant for superconductivity; in fact, it is
important for analysis that its contribution is neglected. Five $X$H$_n$
compounds, predicted to have T$_c$ in the 150-300K range, are analyzed
consistently for their relevant properties, revealing some aspects that
confront conventional wisdom. A phonon frequency -- critical temperature
($\omega_2$-T$_c$) phase diagram is obtained that reveals a common phase
instability limiting T$_c$ at the {\it low pressure} range of each compound.
The hydrogen scattering strength is identified and found to differ strongly
over the hydrides. A quantity directly proportional to T$_c$ in these hydrides
is identified.

strongly convex and smooth objective functions, DSGD asymptotically achieves
the optimal network independent convergence rate compared to centralized
stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Our main contribution is to characterize the
transient time needed for DSGD to approach the asymptotic convergence rate,
which we show behaves as $K_T=\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{n}{(1-\rho_w)^2}\right)$,
where $1-\rho_w$ denotes the spectral gap of the mixing matrix. Moreover, we
construct a ""hard"" optimization problem for which we show the transient time

(CLFs) and feedback stabilization strategies for deterministic nonlinear
control systems described by ordinary differential equations. Many numerical
methods for solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equations
specifying CLFs typically require dense state space discretizations and
consequently suffer from the curse of dimensionality. A relevant direction of
attenuating the curse of dimensionality concerns reducing the computation of
the values of CLFs and associated feedbacks at any selected states to
finite-dimensional nonlinear programming problems. In this work, exit-time
optimal control is used for that purpose. First, we state an exit-time optimal
control problem with respect to a sublevel set of an appropriate local CLF and
establish that, under a number of reasonable conditions, the concatenation of
the corresponding value function and the local CLF is a global CLF in the whole
domain of asymptotic null-controllability. This leads to a
curse-of-dimensionality-free approach to feedback stabilization. We also
investigate the formulated optimal control problem. A modification of these
constructions for the case when one does not find a suitable local CLF is
provided as well. Supporting numerical simulation results that illustrate our
development are subsequently presented and discussed. Furthermore, it is
pointed out that the curse of complexity may cause significant issues in
practical implementation even if the curse of dimensionality is mitigated.

According to the parity formula proposed by Fu, Berg, and Sato, odd-parity
pairing leads to conventional first-order topological superconductivity when a
normal metal has an odd number of Fermi surfaces. Here, we derive generalized
parity formulae for the topological invariants characterizing higher-order
topology of centrosymmetric superconductors. Based on the formulae, we
systematically classify all possible band structures of ferromagnetic metals
that can induce inversion-protected higher-order topological superconductivity.
Among them, doped ferromagnetic nodal semimetals are identified as the most
promising normal state platform for higher-order topological superconductivity.
In two dimensions, we show that odd-parity pairing of doped Dirac semimetals
induces a second-order topological superconductor. In three dimensions,
odd-parity pairing of doped nodal line semimetals generates a nodal line
topological superconductor with monopole charges. On the other hand, odd-parity
pairing of doped monopole nodal line semimetals induces a three-dimensional
third-order topological superconductor. Our theory shows that the combination
of superconductivity and ferromagnetic nodal semimetals opens up a new avenue

the Galactic value, the derived 'QPAH' fraction varies across the Galactic
value (0.071). The sSFR increases with galaxy type, while this is not the case

The galaxy sample is characterised by a tight relation between Mdust and Mstar

smaller Mdust. While the relation indicates that Mdust may fundamentally be
linked to Mstar, metallicity and Uav are the second parameter driving the

average ~20% higher than that derived from the KS law, and a large standard

concept to cases of inconsistent connectedness, where observables have
different distributions in different contexts. This article proposes a solution
within the framework of probabilistic causal models, which extend
hidden-variables theories, and then demonstrates an equivalence to the
contextuality-by-default (CbD) framework. CbD distinguishes contextuality from
direct influences of context on observables, defining the latter purely in
terms of probability distributions. Here we take a causal view of direct
influences, defining direct influence within any causal model as the
probability of all latent states of the system in which a change of context
changes the outcome of a measurement. Model-based contextuality
(M-contextuality) is then defined as the necessity of stronger direct
influences to model a full system than when considered individually. For
consistently connected systems, M-contextuality agrees with standard
contextuality. For general systems, it is proved that M-contextuality is
equivalent to the property that any model of a system must contain ""hidden
influences"", meaning direct influences that go in opposite directions for
different latent states, or equivalently signaling between observers that
carries no information. This criterion can be taken as formalizing the
""no-conspiracy"" principle that has been proposed in connection with CbD.
M-contextuality is then proved to be equivalent to CbD-contextuality, thus
providing a new interpretation of CbD-contextuality as the non-existence of a
model for a system without hidden direct influences.

A fundamental requirement of STC is that any intersection of subsets inherit
one and the same structure from all intersecting subsets. I show that when STC
is applied to systems of random variables, it can be recast in the language of
the Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) theory, and this allows one to extend STC to
arbitrary systems, in which the requirement in question (called ""consistent
connectedness'"" in CbD) is not necessarily satisfied. When applied to
deterministic systems, such as systems of logical statements with fixed truth
values, a problem arises of distinguishing lack of consistent connectedness
from contextuality. I show that it can be resolved by considering systems with
multiple possible deterministic realizations as quasi-probabilistic systems
with Bayesian priors assigned to the realizations. Although STC and CbD have
distinct native languages and distinct aims and means, the conceptual
modifications presented in this paper seem to make them essentially

forced and dissipated flows of the spectrally truncated Navier-Stokes (TNS)
equations. In both of these idealized systems a finite number of Fourier modes
is kept contained inside a sphere of radius $k_{max}$ but while the first
conserves energy in the second energy is injected by a body-force $\bf{f}$ and
dissipated by the viscosity $\nu$. For the TNS system stochastically forced
with energy injection rate $\mathcal{I}_\mathcal{E}$ we show, using an
asymptotic expansion of the Fokker-Planck equation, that in the limit of small
$k_{max}\eta$ (where $\eta=(\nu^3/\mathcal{I}_\mathcal{E})^{1/4}$ the
Kolmogorov lengthscale) the flow approaches the absolute equilibrium solution
of Kraichnan with such an effective ""temperature"" so that there is a balance
between the energy injection and the energy dissipation rate. Numerical
simulations verify the predictions of the model for small values of
$k_{max}\eta$. For intermediate values of $k_{max}\eta$ a transition from the
quasi-equilibrium ""thermal"" state to Kolmogorov turbulence is observed. If the
forcing is applied at small scales and the dissipation acts only at large
scales then the equipartition spectrum appears at all scales for all values of
$\nu$. In both cases a finite forward or inverse flux is present even for the
cases where the flow is close to the equilibrium state solutions. However,
unlike the classical turbulence where an energy cascade develops with a mean
energy flux that is large compared to its fluctuations, the quasi-equilibrium
state has a mean flux of energy that is subdominant to the large flux

Therefore it receives contributions only from the origin of $AdS$ and from
asymptotic infinity. From expanding both the Greens function and the quadratic
operators at the origin of $AdS$ and asymptotic infinity, we show that the
variation of the one loop determinant is proportional to an integer.
Furthermore, we show that this integer is an index of a first order

target for next generation gamma-ray observatories. So far, the remnant is only
detected in the radio and the X-ray bands, but its young age of ~100 yrs and
inferred shock speed of ~14,000 km/s could make it an efficient particle
accelerator. Aims. We aim to model the observed radio and X-ray spectra
together with the morphology of the remnant. At the same time, we aim to
estimate the gamma-ray flux from the source and evaluated the prospects of its
detection with future gamma-ray experiments. Methods. We performed spherical
symmetric 1-D simulations with the RATPaC code, in which we simultaneously
solve the transport equation for cosmic rays, the transport equation for
magnetic turbulence, and the hydro-dynamical equations for the gas flow.
Separately computed distributions of the particles accelerated at the forward
and the reverse shock are then used to calculate the spectra of synchrotron,
inverse Compton, and pion-decay radiation from the source. Results. The
emission from G1.9+0.3 can be self-consistently explained within the
test-particle limit. We find that the X-ray flux is dominated by emission from
the forward shock while most of the radio emission originates near the reverse
shock, which makes G1.9+0.3 the first remnant with non-thermal radiation
detected from the reverse shock. The flux of very-high-energy gamma-ray
emission from G1.9+0.3 is expected to be close to the sensitivity threshold of
the Cherenkov Telescope Array, CTA. The limited time available to grow
large-scale turbulence limits the maximum energy of particles to values below
100 TeV, hence G1.9+0.3 is not a PeVatron.

combination of i) a relativistically smeared reflection component, resulting
from the irradiation of an accretion disk by a compact hard X-ray source, ii)
one or several warm/ionized absorption components produced by AGN-driven
outflows crossing our line of sight, and iii) a non relativistic reflection
component produced by more distant material. Disentangling these components via
detailed model fitting can thus be used to constrain the black hole spin, the
geometry and characteristics of the accretion flow, as well as of the outflows
and surroundings of the black hole. We investigate how a high throughput high
resolution X-ray spectrometer, such as the Athena X-ray Integral Field Unit
(X-IFU) can be used to this aim, using the state of the art reflection model
Relxill in a lamp post geometrical configuration. We simulate a representative
sample of AGN spectra, including all necessary model complexities, as well as a
range of model parameters going from standard to more extreme values, and
considered X-ray fluxes that are representative of known AGN and Quasars (QSOs)
populations. We also present a method to estimate the systematic errors related
to the uncertainties in the calibration of the X-IFU. In a conservative
setting, in which the reflection component is computed self consistently by the
Relxill model from the pre-set geometry and no iron over abundance, the mean
errors on the spin and height of the irradiating source are <0.05 and ~0.2 Rg.
Similarly the absorber parameters are measured to an accuracy typically less
than ~5%. Extending the simulations to include blue shifted ultra fast
outflows, we show that X-IFU could measure their velocity with statistical
errors <1% even for high redshift objects (abridged).

including instrumental effects and beam-smearing, we fit simultaneously the
observed galaxy velocity and velocity dispersion along the kinematic major axis
to derive the intrinsic velocity dispersion $\sigma_0$. We find a reduction of
the average intrinsic velocity dispersion of disk galaxies as a function of
cosmic time, from $\sigma_0\sim45$ km s$^{-1}$ at $z\sim2.3$ to
$\sigma_0\sim30$ km s$^{-1}$ at $z\sim0.9$. There is substantial intrinsic
scatter ($\sigma_{\sigma_0, {\rm int}}\approx10$ km s$^{-1}$) around the
best-fit $\sigma_0-z$-relation beyond what can be accounted for from the
typical measurement uncertainties ($\delta\sigma_0\approx12$ km s$^{-1}$),
independent of other identifiable galaxy parameters. This potentially suggests
a dynamic mechanism such as minor mergers or variation in accretion being
responsible for the scatter. Putting our data into the broader literature
context, we find that ionized and atomic+molecular velocity dispersions evolve
similarly with redshift, with the ionized gas dispersion being $\sim10-15$ km
s$^{-1}$ higher on average. We investigate the physical driver of the on
average elevated velocity dispersions at higher redshift, and find that our
galaxies are at most marginally Toomre-stable, suggesting that their turbulent
velocities are powered by gravitational instabilities, while stellar feedback
as a driver alone is insufficient. This picture is supported through comparison
with a state-of-the-art analytical model of galaxy evolution.

due to tunneling effects on planet-forming disks. Our aim is to quantify the
astrophysical implications of atom tunneling for simple molecules that are
frequently used to infer disk structure information or to define the initial
conditions for planet (atmosphere) formation. We explain the tunneling effect
on reaction rates by using a scholarly example in comparison to previous
UMIST2012 rate constants. In a chemical network with 1299 reactions, we
identify all reactions that could show atom tunneling. We devise a simple
formulation of reaction rate constants that overestimates tunneling and screen
a standard T Tauri disk model for changes in species abundances. For those
reactions found to be relevant, we find values of the most recent literature
for the rate constants including tunneling and compare the resulting disk
chemistry to the standard disk models. The rate constants in the UMIST2012
database in many cases already capture tunneling effects implicitly. A rigorous
screening procedure identified three neutral-neutral reactions where atom
tunneling could change simple molecule abundances. However, by adopting recent
values of the rate constants of these reactions and due to the layered
structure of planet-forming disks, the effects are limited to a small region
where cold neutral-neutral chemistry dominates. Abundances of water close to
the midplane snowline can increase by a factor of two at most compared to
previous results with UMIST2012 rates. Observables from the disk surface, such
as high excitation (> 500 K) water line fluxes, decrease by 60% at most when
tunneling effects are explicitly excluded. On the other hand, disk midplane
quantities relevant for planet formation such as the C-to-O ratio and also the
ice-to-rock ratio are clearly affected by these gas-phase tunneling effects.

  Examining the black hole feedback model in IllustrisTNG","20 pages, submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/staa374",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Supermassive black hole feedback is thought to be responsible for the lack of
star formation, or quiescence, in a significant fraction of galaxies. We
explore how observable correlations between the specific star formation rate
(sSFR), stellar mass (M$_{\rm{star}}$), and black hole mass (M$_{\rm{BH}}$) are
sensitive to the physics of black hole feedback in a galaxy formation model. We
use the IllustrisTNG simulation suite, specifically the TNG100 simulation and
ten model variations that alter the parameters of the black hole model.
Focusing on central galaxies at $z = 0$ with M$_{\rm{star}} > 10^{10}$
M$_{\odot}$, we find that the sSFR of galaxies in IllustrisTNG decreases once
the energy from black hole kinetic winds at low accretion rates becomes larger
than the gravitational binding energy of gas within the galaxy stellar radius.
This occurs at a particular M$_{\rm{BH}}$ threshold above which galaxies are
found to sharply transition from being mostly star-forming to mostly quiescent.
As a result of this behavior, the fraction of quiescent galaxies as a function
of M$_{\rm{star}}$ is sensitive to both the normalization of the
M$_{\rm{BH}}$-M$_{\rm{star}}$ relation and the M$_{\rm{BH}}$ threshold for
quiescence in IllustrisTNG. Finally, we compare these model results to
observations of 91 central galaxies with dynamical M$_{\rm{BH}}$ measurements
with the caveat that this sample is not representative of the whole galaxy
population. While IllustrisTNG reproduces the observed trend that quiescent
galaxies host more massive black holes, the observations exhibit a broader
scatter in M$_{\rm{BH}}$ at a given M$_{\rm{star}}$ and show a smoother decline
in sSFR with M$_{\rm{BH}}$.

two-dimensional structure. The spatial distribution of highly probable Jhelum
members reveals a dense thin component and an associated diffuse, spatially
offset component. These two spatial components have indistinguishable proper
motions (at $\sigma\sim1\,\rm mas\,yr^{-1}$ level) and a similar ratio of blue
straggler to blue horizontal branch stars, which indicates a common origin for
the two components. The best-fit orbit to the narrow component (pericenter
$8\,\rm kpc$, apocenter $24\,\rm kpc$), however, does not explain the wide
component of the Jhelum stream. On the other hand, an older orbital wrap of
Jhelum's orbit traces the Indus stream, indicating a possible connection
between these two structures and additional complexity in Jhelum's formation.
Substructure in the Jhelum progenitor or precession of its tidal debris in the
Milky Way potential may explain the observed structure of Jhelum. Future
spectroscopic data will enable discrimination between these ""nature"" and

rotation affects electronic transports. Here we study the role of octahedra
tilting away from the c-axis, in determining superconducting pairing symmetry.
We show that the octahedra tilting changes the large Fermi surface to a Dirac
point, which strongly suppresses the conventional d-wave pairing. Furthermore,
it also promotes effective spin-triplet interactions in the strong Hubbard
interaction limit, leading to a transition from the even-parity to odd-parity
superconducting phase. Thus, tuning octahedra distortions can be used as a tool
to engineer a spin triplet superconductor in strongly correlated systems with

measurements of two observers at distant space-time points are expected to
remain independent until their past light-cones overlap. Surprisingly, we find
that in the presence of topological excitations correlations can develop
outside of horizon and indeed even between infinitely distant points. We
demonstrate this effect for a wide class of global quantum quenches to the

by relativistic invariance, clustering of initial correlations is required to
establish the ""horizon effect"". We show that quenches in the sine-Gordon model
have an interesting property: despite the fact that the initial states have
exponentially decaying correlations and cluster in terms of the bosonic fields,
they violate the clustering condition for the soliton fields, which is argued
to be related to the non-trivial field topology. The nonlinear dynamics
governed by the solitons makes the clustering violation manifest also in

fractional disclination charges from the Wannier representations in real space
and use band representation theory to construct topological indices of the
fractional disclination charge for all $2D$ TCIs that admit a (generalized)
Wannier representation. We find the disclination charge is fractionalized in
units of $\frac{e}{n}$ for $C_n$ symmetric TCIs; and for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
TCIs, with additional time reversal symmetry, the disclination charge is
fractionalized in units of $\frac{2e}{n}$. We furthermore prove that with
electron-electron interactions that preserve the $C_n$ symmetry and many-body
bulk gap, though we can deform a TCI into another which is topologically
distinct in the free fermion case, the fractional disclination charge
determined by our topological indices will not change in this process.
Moreover, we use an algebraic technique to generalize the indices for TCIs with
non-zero Chern numbers, where a Wannier representation is not applicable. With
the inclusion of the Chern number, our generalized fractional disclination
indices apply for all $C_n$ symmetric TCIs. Finally, we briefly discuss the

the first time, we present a systematic exploration based on analytic

representative examples of the most widely employed modeling abstractions. We
identify that the synaptic formalism, i.e. current or conductance based

significant factor in determining the properties of memory bandwidth saturation

find that for all types of abstractions, network latency and memory bandwidth

Despite its success, the design principle of the Transformer remains elusive.
In this paper, we provide a novel perspective towards understanding the
architecture: we show that the Transformer can be mathematically interpreted as
a numerical Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver for a
convection-diffusion equation in a multi-particle dynamic system. In
particular, how words in a sentence are abstracted into contexts by passing
through the layers of the Transformer can be interpreted as approximating
multiple particles' movement in the space using the Lie-Trotter splitting
scheme and the Euler's method. Given this ODE's perspective, the rich
literature of numerical analysis can be brought to guide us in designing
effective structures beyond the Transformer. As an example, we propose to
replace the Lie-Trotter splitting scheme by the Strang-Marchuk splitting
scheme, a scheme that is more commonly used and with much lower local
truncation errors. The Strang-Marchuk splitting scheme suggests that the
self-attention and position-wise feed-forward network (FFN) sub-layers should
not be treated equally. Instead, in each layer, two position-wise FFN
sub-layers should be used, and the self-attention sub-layer is placed in
between. This leads to a brand new architecture. Such an FFN-attention-FFN
layer is ""Macaron-like"", and thus we call the network with this new
architecture the Macaron Net. Through extensive experiments, we show that the
Macaron Net is superior to the Transformer on both supervised and unsupervised
learning tasks. The reproducible codes and pretrained models can be found at

axion decay constant $f$ to be super-Planckian in size. However, $f > M_{Pl}$
is disfavored by the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC). It is then pertinent to ask
if one can construct axion inflation models in conformity with WGC. In this
work we assume that WGC holds for the microscopic Lagrangian so that $f <
M_{Pl}$. However, inflation is controlled by an effective Lagrangian much below
the Planck scale where the inflaton is an effective axionic field associated
with an effective decay constant $f_e$ which could be very different from $f$.
In this work we propose a Coherent Enhancement Mechanism (CEM) for slow roll
inflation controlled by flat potentials which can produce $f_e \gg M_{Pl}$
while $f < M_{Pl}$. In the analysis we consider a landscape of chiral fields
charged under a $U\left(1\right)$ global shift symmetry and consider breaking
of the $U\left(1\right)$ symmetry by instanton type symmetry breaking terms. In
the broken phase there is one light pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-Boson (pNGB) which
acts as the inflaton. We show that with an appropriate choice of symmetry
breaking terms the inflaton potential is a superposition of many cosines and
the condition that they produce a flat potential allows one to enhance $f_e$ so
that $f_e / M_{Pl} \gg 1$. We discuss the utility of this mechanism for a
variety of inflaton models originating in supersymmetry and supergravity. The
Coherent Enhancement Mechanism allows one to reduce an inflation model with an
arbitrary potential to an effective model of natural inflation, i.e. with a
single cosine, by expanding the potential near a field point where horizon exit
occurs, and matching the expansion coefficients to those of natural inflation.

known as ultra-fast outflows (UFO) are commonly found in the spectra of many
Seyfert galaxies and quasars, and a correlation has been suggested between
them. Recent detections of low ionization and low column density outflows, but
with a high velocity comparable to UFOs, challenge such initial possible
correlations. Observations of UFOs in AGN indicate that their energetics may be
enough to have an impact on the interstellar medium (ISM). However,
observational evidence of the interaction between the inner high-ionization
outflow and the ISM is still missing. We present here the spectral analysis of
12 XMM-Newton/EPIC archival observations of the quasar PG 1114+445, aimed at
studying the complex outflowing nature of its absorbers. Our analysis revealed
the presence of three absorbing structures. We find a WA with velocity
$v\sim530$ km s$^{-1}$, ionization $\log\xi/\text{erg cm s}^{-1}\sim0.35,$ and
column density $\log N_\text{H}/\text{cm}^{-2}\sim22$, and a UFO with
$v_\text{out}\sim0.145c$, $\log\xi/\text{erg cm s}^{-1}\sim4$, and $\log

soft X-rays ($E<2$ keV) with velocity comparable to that of the UFO

comparable with those of the WA. The ionization, velocity, and variability of
the three absorbers indicate an origin in a multiphase and multiscale outflow,
consistent with entrainment of the clumpy ISM by an inner UFO moving at
$\sim15\%$ the speed of light, producing an entrained ultra-fast outflow

coupling condition guarantees that all the variables of the system are
dissipative even though the system is not totally dissipative. Hence it plays a
crucial role in terms of sufficient conditions for the global in time existence
of classical solutions. However, it is easy to find physically based models
that do not satisfy this condition, especially in several space dimensions. In
this paper, we consider two simple examples of partially dissipative hyperbolic
systems violating the Shizuta-Kawashima condition ([SK]) in 3D, such that some
eigendirections do not exhibit dissipation at all. We prove that, if the source
term is non resonant (in a suitable sense) in the direction where dissipation
does not play any role, then the formation of singularities is prevented,
despite the lack of dissipation, and the smooth solutions exist globally in
time. The main idea of the proof is to couple Green function estimates for
weakly dissipative hyperbolic systems with the space-time resonance analysis
for dispersive equations introduced by Germain, Masmoudi and Shatah. More
precisely, the partially dissipative hyperbolic systems violating [SK] are
endowed, in the non-dissipative directions, with a special structure of the
nonlinearity, the so-called Nonresonant Bilinear Form for the wave equation

mining by using a population-based approach. Blockchain relies on solving
difficult mathematical problems as proof-of-work within a network before blocks
are added to the chain. Brute force approach, advocated by some as the fastest
algorithm for solving partial hash collisions and implemented in Bitcoin
blockchain, implies exhaustive, sequential search. It involves incrementing the
nonce (number) of the header by one, then taking a double SHA-256 hash at each
instance and comparing it with a target value to ascertain if lower than that
target. It excessively consumes both time and power. In this paper, the
authors, therefore, suggest using an inner for-loop for the population-based
approach. Comparison shows that it's a slightly faster approach than brute
force, with an average speed advantage of about 1.67% or 3,420 iterations per
second and 73% of the time performing better. Also, we observed that the more
the total particles deployed, the better the performance until a pivotal point.
Furthermore, a recommendation on taming the excessive use of power by networks,
like Bitcoin's, by using penalty by consensus is suggested.

suggests that small, sparsified networks can be trained so long as the network

initializations is computationally expensive. One potential solution is to
reuse the same winning tickets across a variety of datasets and optimizers.
However, the generality of winning ticket initializations remains unclear.
Here, we attempt to answer this question by generating winning tickets for one
training configuration (optimizer and dataset) and evaluating their performance
on another configuration. Perhaps surprisingly, we found that, within the
natural images domain, winning ticket initializations generalized across a
variety of datasets, including Fashion MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, and
Places365, often achieving performance close to that of winning tickets
generated on the same dataset. Moreover, winning tickets generated using larger
datasets consistently transferred better than those generated using smaller
datasets. We also found that winning ticket initializations generalize across
optimizers with high performance. These results suggest that winning ticket
initializations generated by sufficiently large datasets contain inductive
biases generic to neural networks more broadly which improve training across
many settings and provide hope for the development of better initialization

interested in Nash equilibria (NE) of this game, as well as in characterizing
$defense$-$optimal$ networks which allow for the best $equilibrium$ $defense$

number of attackers that the defender catches in a NE. We provide
characterizations of the NEs of this game and defense-optimal networks. This
allows us to show that the NEs of the game coincide independently from the
coordination or not of the attackers. In addition, we give an algorithm for
computing NEs. Our algorithm requires exponential time in the worst case, but
it is polynomial-time for $\lambda$ constantly close to 1 or $n$. For the
special case of tree-networks, we refine our characterization which allows us
to derive a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding whether a tree is

breaks several of CEEI's desirable properties such as envy, regret, Pareto

residents is among the most widely-studied quantities in evolutionary dynamics.
Amplifiers of natural selection are population structures that increase the
fixation probability of advantageous mutants, compared to well-mixed
populations. Extensive studies have shown that many amplifiers exist for the
Birth-death Moran process, some of them substantially increasing the fixation
probability or even guaranteeing fixation in the limit of large population
size. On the other hand, no amplifiers are known for the death-Birth Moran
process, and computer-assisted exhaustive searches have failed to discover
amplification. In this work we resolve this disparity, by showing that any
amplification under death-Birth updating is necessarily \emph{bounded} and
\emph{transient}. Our boundedness result states that even if a population
structure does amplify selection, the resulting fixation probability is close
to that of the well-mixed population. Our transience result states that for any
population structure there exists a threshold $r^*$ such that the population
structure ceases to amplify selection if the mutant fitness advantage $r$ is
larger than $r^\star$. Finally, we also extend the above results to
$\delta$-death-Birth updating, which is a combination of Birth-death and
death-Birth updating. On the positive side, we identify population structures
that maintain amplification for a wide range of values $r$ and $\delta$. These
results demonstrate that amplification of natural selection depends on the

parametric, trace, and narrow band methods. The parametric method entails
constructing an approximating polyhedral surface $\Gamma$ whose faces comprise
the finite element triangulation. The finite element method is then posed over
the approximate surface $\Gamma$ in a manner very similar to standard FEM on
Euclidean domains. In the trace method it is assumed that the given surface
$\gamma$ is embedded in an $n+1$-dimensional domain $\Omega$ which has itself
been triangulated. An $n$-dimensional approximate surface $\Gamma$ is then
constructed roughly speaking by interpolating $\gamma$ over the triangulation
of $\Omega$, and the finite element space over $\Gamma$ consists of the trace
(restriction) of a standard finite element space on $\Omega$ to $\Gamma$. In
the narrow band method the PDE posed on the surface is extended to a
triangulated $n+1$-dimensional band about $\gamma$ whose width is proportional
to the diameter of elements in the triangulation. In all cases we provide
optimal a priori error estimates for the lowest-order finite element methods,

apparently incompatible properties of crystalline order and superfluidity, was
predicted 50 years ago. Solid helium was the natural candidate, but there
supersolidity has not been observed yet, despite numerous attempts. Ultracold
quantum gases have recently shown the appearance of the periodic order typical
of a crystal, due to various types of controllable interactions. A crucial
feature of a D-dimensional supersolid is the occurrence of up to D+1 gapless
excitations reflecting the Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous
breaking of two continuous symmetries: the breaking of phase invariance,
corresponding to the locking of the phase of the atomic wave functions at the
origin of superfluid phenomena, and the breaking of translational invariance
due to the lattice structure of the system. The occurrence of such modes has
been the object of intense theoretical investigations, but their experimental
observation is still missing. Here we demonstrate the supersolid symmetry
breaking through the appearance of two distinct compressional oscillation modes
in a harmonically trapped dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate, reflecting the
gapless Goldstone excitations of the homogeneous system. We observe that the
two modes have different natures, with the higher frequency mode associated
with an oscillation of the periodicity of the emergent lattice and the lower
one characterizing the superfluid oscillations. Our work paves the way to
explore the two quantum phase transitions between the superfluid, supersolid
and solid-like configurations that can be accessed by tuning a single
interaction parameter.

the relation between loop gravity and teleparallel gravity. We argue that these

first discretization leads to the \emph{{loop gravity}} kinematical phase space

to vanish {first}. Our argument is based on the observation that the GR
first-order Einstein--Cartan action can also be seen as a first-order action
for teleparallel gravity up to a boundary term. The results of our paper
suggest that the \emph{dual loop gravity} framework is a natural discretization
of teleparallel gravity, whereas \emph{loop gravity} is naturally related to
the standard GR metric description.

importance to comprehensively understand the dynamic traffic environment,
especially the future possible trajectories of surrounding vehicles. This paper
presents an algorithm for long-horizon trajectory prediction of surrounding
vehicles using a dual long short term memory (LSTM) network, which is capable
of effectively improving prediction accuracy in strongly interactive driving
environments. In contrast to traditional approaches which require trajectory
matching and manual feature selection, this method can automatically learn
high-level spatial-temporal features of driver behaviors from naturalistic
driving data through sequence learning. By employing two blocks of LSTMs, the
proposed method feeds the sequential trajectory to the first LSTM for driver
intention recognition as an intermediate indicator, which is immediately
followed by a second LSTM for future trajectory prediction. Test results from
real-world highway driving data show that the proposed method can, in
comparison to state-of-art methods, output more accurate and reasonable
estimate of different future trajectories over 5s time horizon with root mean
square error (RMSE) for longitudinal and lateral prediction less than 5.77m and
0.49m, respectively.

volatile cycle but remains debated. Given the large uncertainties surrounding
the spatio-temporal pattern of fluid flow and the equilibrium state within
subducting slabs, a model of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ transport in slabs should be
balanced between model simplicity and capability. We construct such a model in
a two-part contribution. In this Part I of our contribution, thermodynamic
parameterization is performed for the devolatilization of representative
subducting materials---sediments, basalts, gabbros, peridotites. The
parameterization avoids reproducing the details of specific devolatilization
reactions, but instead captures the overall behaviors of coupled (de)hydration
and (de)carbonation. Two general, leading-order features of devolatilization
are captured: (1) the released volatiles are H$_2$O-rich near the onset of
devolatilization; (2) increase of the ratio of bulk CO$_2$ over H$_2$O inhibits
overall devolatilization and thus lessens decarbonation. These two features
play an important role in simulation of volatile fractionation and infiltration
in thermodynamically open systems. When constructing the reactive fluid flow
model of slab H$_2$O and CO$_2$ transport in the companion paper Part II, this
parameterization can be incorporated to efficiently account for the open-system

a class of events, which we call extreme events, with the property that the
kinematic boundary of their allowed region in mass parameter space passes
through the true mass point. We develop techniques for recognizing extreme

(the density of kinematic boundary curves), the method avoids some of the
systematic errors associated with other techniques. We show that this new
approach is complementary to previously considered methods in the literature

corpora has practical significance for real-world applications, and it is one

unsupervised learning for solving such classification problems has been made

emphasize the key information that enables the success of unsupervised learning

Exploitation of such sequential statistics makes it possible to estimate

non-Gaussian tails from interacting quantum fields during early universe
inflation. The multi-field potential landscape may contain relatively flat
directions, as a result of energetically favorable adjustments of fields
coupled to the inflaton. Such additional fields do not contribute to CMB
fluctuations given a sufficient large-scale decay, related to a gap in the
critical exponents computed using stochastic methods. Along such directions
transverse to the inflaton, the field makes rare jumps to large values. Mixing
with the inflaton leads to a substantial tail in the resulting probability
distribution for the primordial perturbations. Incorporating a large number of
flavors of fields ensures theoretical control of radiative corrections and a
substantial abundance. This generates significant PBH production for a
reasonable window of parameters, with the mass range determined by the time
period of mixing and the inflationary Hubble scale. We analyze a particular
model in detail, and then comment on a broader family of models in this class

notion that is often too conservative for realized dataset instances. We
provide methods for scaling noise in an instance-dependent way and demonstrate
that they provide greater accuracy under average-case distributional

  Specifically, we consider the basic problem of privately estimating the mean

estimator can have arbitrarily-high global sensitivity. We propose the trimmed
mean estimator, which interpolates between the mean and the median, as a way of
attaining much lower sensitivity on average while losing very little in terms
of statistical accuracy.
  To privately estimate the trimmed mean, we revisit the smooth sensitivity
framework of Nissim, Raskhodnikova, and Smith (STOC 2007), which provides a
framework for using instance-dependent sensitivity. We propose three new
additive noise distributions which provide concentrated differential privacy

best candidate for a microinstability that scatters strahl electrons into the

threshold in two different $\beta_{\mathrm c}$ regimes, where $\beta_{\mathrm

pressure, and confirm the accuracy of these thresholds through comparison with
numerical solutions to the hot-plasma dispersion relation. We find that the
strahl-driven oblique FM/W instability creates copious FM/W waves under
low-$\beta_{\mathrm c}$ conditions when $U_{0\mathrm s}\gtrsim 3w_{\mathrm c}$,
where $U_{0\mathrm s}$ is the strahl speed and $w_{\mathrm c}$ is the thermal

local electron gyrofrequency. We also derive an analytic expression for the
oblique FM/W instability for $\beta_{\mathrm c}\sim 1$. The comparison of our

dish. From a visual perspective, every instruction step can be seen as a way to
change the visual appearance of the dish by adding extra objects (e.g., adding
an ingredient) or changing the appearance of the existing ones (e.g., cooking
the dish). In this paper, we aim to teach a machine how to make a pizza by
building a generative model that mirrors this step-by-step procedure. To do so,
we learn composable module operations which are able to either add or remove a
particular ingredient. Each operator is designed as a Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN). Given only weak image-level supervision, the operators are
trained to generate a visual layer that needs to be added to or removed from
the existing image. The proposed model is able to decompose an image into an
ordered sequence of layers by applying sequentially in the right order the
corresponding removing modules. Experimental results on synthetic and real
pizza images demonstrate that our proposed model is able to: (1) segment pizza
toppings in a weaklysupervised fashion, (2) remove them by revealing what is
occluded underneath them (i.e., inpainting), and (3) infer the ordering of the
toppings without any depth ordering supervision. Code, data, and models are

medical image segmentation, standard models still have some drawbacks. First,
the use of multi-scale approaches, i.e., encoder-decoder architectures, leads
to a redundant use of information, where similar low-level features are
extracted multiple times at multiple scales. Second, long-range feature
dependencies are not efficiently modeled, resulting in non-optimal
discriminative feature representations associated with each semantic class. In
this paper we attempt to overcome these limitations with the proposed
architecture, by capturing richer contextual dependencies based on the use of
guided self-attention mechanisms. This approach is able to integrate local
features with their corresponding global dependencies, as well as highlight
interdependent channel maps in an adaptive manner. Further, the additional loss
between different modules guides the attention mechanisms to neglect irrelevant
information and focus on more discriminant regions of the image by emphasizing
relevant feature associations. We evaluate the proposed model in the context of
semantic segmentation on three different datasets: abdominal organs,
cardiovascular structures and brain tumors. A series of ablation experiments
support the importance of these attention modules in the proposed architecture.
In addition, compared to other state-of-the-art segmentation networks our model
yields better segmentation performance, increasing the accuracy of the
predictions while reducing the standard deviation. This demonstrates the

we introduce a new dataset for figure captioning, FigCAP, based on FigureQA.
Second, we propose two novel attention mechanisms. To achieve accurate
generation of labels in figures, we propose Label Maps Attention. To model the
relations between figure labels, we propose Relation Maps Attention. Third, we
use sequence-level training with reinforcement learning in order to directly
optimizes evaluation metrics, which alleviates the exposure bias issue and
further improves the models in generating long captions. Extensive experiments
show that the proposed method outperforms the baselines, thus demonstrating a
significant potential for the automatic captioning of vast repositories of
figures.

multi-stream framework to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) manual signs
(consisting of movements of the hands, as well as non-manual face movements in
some cases) in real-time from RGB-D videos, by fusing multimodality features
including hand gestures, facial expressions, and body poses from multi-channels
(RGB, depth, motion, and skeleton joints). To learn the overall temporal
dynamics in a video, a proxy video is generated by selecting a subset of frames
for each video which are then used to train the proposed 3DCNN model. We
collect a new ASL dataset, ASL-100-RGBD, which contains 42 RGB-D videos
captured by a Microsoft Kinect V2 camera, each of 100 ASL manual signs,
including RGB channel, depth maps, skeleton joints, face features, and HDface.
The dataset is fully annotated for each semantic region (i.e. the time duration
of each word that the human signer performs). Our proposed method achieves
92.88 accuracy for recognizing 100 ASL words in our newly collected
ASL-100-RGBD dataset. The effectiveness of our framework for recognizing hand
gestures from RGB-D videos is further demonstrated on the Chalearn IsoGD
dataset and achieves 76 accuracy which is 5.51 higher than the state-of-the-art
work in terms of average fusion by using only 5 channels instead of 12 channels
in the previous work.

method, IDM differs from many existing dimensionality reduction and clustering
methods in that it neither requires a cherry-picked distance metric nor the
ground-true number of clusters, and that it can be used to unroll and zoom-in

research area for epidemiology, marketing, cybersecurity, and ecology. However,
current diffusion models cannot capture transmissions occurring for indirect
interactions. For example, an airborne infected individual releases infectious
particles at locations that can suspend in the air and infect susceptible
individuals arriving even after the infected individual left. Thus, current
diffusion models miss transmissions during indirect interactions. In this
thesis, a novel diffusion model called the same place different time
transmission based diffusion (SPDT) is introduced to take into account the
transmissions through indirect interactions. The behaviour of SPDT diffusion is
analysed on real dynamic contact networks and a significant amplification in
diffusion dynamics is observed. The SPDT model also introduces some novel
behaviours different from current diffusion models. In this work, a new SPDT
graph model is also developed to generate synthetic traces to explore SPDT
diffusion in several scenarios. The analysis shows that the emergence of new
diffusion becomes common thanks to the inclusion of indirect transmissions
within the SPDT model. This work finally investigates how diffusion can be
controlled and develops new methods to hinder diffusion.

Biometric systems such as recent deep face recognition models are not immune to
obstructions or other objects covering parts of the face. While most of the
current face recognition methods are not optimized to handle occlusions, there
have been a few attempts to improve robustness directly in the training stage.
Unlike those, we propose to study the effect of generative face completion on
the recognition. We offer a face completion encoder-decoder, based on a
convolutional operator with a gating mechanism, trained with an ample set of
face occlusions. To systematically evaluate the impact of realistic occlusions
on recognition, we propose to play the occlusion game: we render 3D objects
onto different face parts, providing precious knowledge of what the impact is
of effectively removing those occlusions. Extensive experiments on the Labeled
Faces in the Wild (LFW), and its more difficult variant LFW-BLUFR, testify that
face completion is able to partially restore face perception in machine vision

non-convex combinatorial problem, which is generally NP-hard and difficult to
get the optimal solution. Traditional methods to solve this problem are mainly
based on mathematical optimization techniques, where accurate channel state
information (CSI), usually obtained through channel estimation and feedback, is
needed. To overcome the high computational complexity of the traditional
methods and eliminate the costly channel estimation stage, machine leaning (ML)
has been introduced recently to address the wireless link scheduling problems.
In this paper, we propose a novel graph embedding based method for link
scheduling in D2D networks. We first construct a fully-connected directed graph
for the D2D network, where each D2D pair is a node while interference links
among D2D pairs are the edges. Then we compute a low-dimensional feature vector
for each node in the graph. The graph embedding process is based on the
distances of both communication and interference links, therefore without
requiring the accurate CSI. By utilizing a multi-layer classifier, a scheduling
strategy can be learned in a supervised manner based on the graph embedding
results for each node. We also propose an unsupervised manner to train the
graph embedding based method to further reinforce the scalability and
generalizability and develop a K-nearest neighbor graph representation method
to reduce the computational complexity. Extensive simulation demonstrates that
the proposed method is near-optimal compared with the existing state-of-art
methods but is with only hundreds of training samples. It is also competitive
in terms of scalability and generalizability to more complicated scenarios.

compress RNN layers by 15-38x with minimal accuracy loss. By quantizing the

light curve following the main burst. It is shown that an X-ray plateau at the
observed luminosity emerges naturally from a plerion-like model of the sGRB
remnant, in which the magnetized, relativistic wind of a millisecond magnetar
injects shock-accelerated electrons into a cavity confined by the sGRB blast
wave. A geometry-dependent fraction of the plerionic radiation is also
intercepted and reprocessed by the optically thick merger ejecta. The relative
contributions of the plerion and ejecta to the composite X-ray light curve are
estimated approximately with the aid of established ejecta models. The
plerionic component of the electron energy spectrum is evolved under the action
of time-dependent, power-law injection and adiabatic and synchrotron cooling in
order to calculate the X-ray light curve analytically. The model yields an
anti-correlation between the luminosity and duration of the plateau as well as
a sudden cut-off in the X-ray flux, if the decelerating magnetar collapses to
form a black hole. Both features are broadly consistent with the data and can
be related to the surface magnetic field of the magnetar and its angular
velocity at birth. The analogy with core-collapse supernova remnants is
discussed briefly.

[arXiv:1501.04252, arXiv:1511.08759, arXiv:1606.07870] and it is organized in
the following way. The second chapter is shown as the isometric group of the
space time AdS is exactly (isomorphic) match to the conformal group of the dual
CFT theory. We present the precise formulation of the duality AdS/CFT and we
describe the behavior of a massive scalar field in AdS space-time. In chapter 3
we present solutions of black holes widely known in the literature, which we
will use in some later calculations to gain intuition, we explain the no-hair
theorem and two examples of exact black hole solutions that can evade this
theorem. These results were published in [arXiv:1211.2765, arXiv:1311.6065,
arXiv:1311.7459]. Chapter 4 we present details of the methods of holographic
renormalization and Hamiltonian formalism, which are applied in the development
of the later chapters. For the solution SAdS calculate the on-shell action and
regularize, compare with the method of subtraction of the background. Chapter 5
is based on [arXiv:1606.07870]. We investigated the boundary conditions of AdS
in the presence of a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity with conformal
mass $m^{2}=-2/l^{2}$, for non-logarithmic and logarithmic branch. We calculate
the on-shell action, we study the variational principle and propose new
counter-terms that regularize the action. Chapter 6, is based on
[arXiv:1501.04252, arXiv:1606.07870], we describe the phase transitions of
black holes with scalar hair and horizons flat and spherical. We build the
thermodynamic phase diagrams and discuss their implications in the dual quantum
field theory. Finally in chapter 7 the conclusions and future directions of the
work are presented.

data with the goal of learning patient risk stratification models. Their
effectiveness is due, in part, to their use of parameter sharing over time
(i.e., cells are repeated hence the name recurrent). We hypothesize, however,
that this trait also contributes to the increased difficulty such models have
with learning relationships that change over time. Conditional shift, i.e.,
changes in the relationship between the input X and the output y, arises when
risk factors associated with the event of interest change over the course of a
patient admission. While in theory, RNNs and gated RNNs (e.g., LSTMs) in
particular should be capable of learning time-varying relationships, when
training data are limited, such models often fail to accurately capture these
dynamics. We illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of complete parameter
sharing (RNNs) by comparing an LSTM with shared parameters to a sequential
architecture with time-varying parameters on prediction tasks involving three
clinically-relevant outcomes: acute respiratory failure (ARF), shock, and
in-hospital mortality. In experiments using synthetic data, we demonstrate how
parameter sharing in LSTMs leads to worse performance in the presence of
conditional shift. To improve upon the dichotomy between complete parameter
sharing and no parameter sharing, we propose a novel RNN formulation based on a
mixture model in which we relax parameter sharing over time. The proposed
method outperforms standard LSTMs and other state-of-the-art baselines across
all tasks. In settings with limited data, relaxed parameter sharing can lead to
improved patient risk stratification performance.

experiments show that by applying the same policy to different network
architectures, AutoGrow can always discover near-optimal depth on various
datasets of MNIST, FashionMNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet. For

of the underlying model change over time. These components could be thought of
as the claim arrival rate, the claim-size distribution, and the premium rate,
but we allow the more general setting of the cumulative claim process being
modelled as a spectrally positive L\'evy process. We provide an intuitively
appealing mechanism to create such parameter uncertainty: at Poisson epochs we
resample the model components from a finite number of $d$ settings. It results
in a setup that is particularly suited to describe situations in which the risk
reserve dynamics are affected by external processes (such as the state of the
economy, political developments, weather or climate conditions, and policy
regulations). We extend the classical Cram\'er-Lundberg approximation
(asymptotically characterizing the all-time ruin probability in a light-tailed
setting) to this more general setup. In addition, for the situation that the
driving L\'evy processes are sums of Brownian motions and compound Poisson
processes, we find an explicit uniform bound on the ruin probability, which can
be viewed as an extension of Lundberg's inequality; importantly, here it is not
required that the L\'evy processes be spectrally one-sided. In passing we
propose an importance-sampling algorithm facilitating efficient estimation, and
prove it has bounded relative error. In a series of numerical experiments we
assess the accuracy of the asymptotics and bounds, and illustrate that
neglecting the resampling can lead to substantial underestimation of the risk.

down, and the pulse profile is found to be double-peaked up to 16 keV with the

semantics of the binary's functions through either manual or automatic
analysis. Manual semantic analysis is time-consuming, because abstractions
provided by high level languages, such as type information, variable scope, or
comments are lost, and past analyses cannot apply to the current analysis task.
Existing automated binary analysis tools currently suffer from low accuracy in
determining semantic function identification in the presence of diverse
compilation environments.
  We introduce Software Ethology, a binary analysis approach for determining
the semantic similarity of functions. Software Ethology abstracts semantic
behavior as classification vectors of program state changes resulting from a
function executing with a specified input state, and uses these vectors as a
unique fingerprint for identification. All existing semantic identifiers
determine function similarity via code measurements, and suffer from high
inaccuracy when classifying functions from compilation environments different
from their ground truth source. Since Software Ethology does not rely on code
measurements, its accuracy is resilient to changes in compiler, compiler
version, optimization level, or even different source implementing equivalent
functionality.
  Tinbergen, our prototype Software Ethology implementation, leverages a
virtual execution environment and a fuzzer to generate the classification
vectors. In evaluating Tinbergen's feasibility as a semantic function

encoders and a decoder, where these encoders independently encode source
sequences from two correlated sources into codewords, and the decoder
reconstructs both source sequences from the codewords. In this paper, we
consider the situation in which the SW coding system is asynchronous, i.e.,
each encoder samples a source sequence with some unknown delay. We assume that
delays are unknown but maximum and minimum values of possible delays are known
to encoders and the decoder. We also assume that sources are discrete
stationary memoryless and the probability mass function (PMF) of the sources is
unknown but the system knows that it belongs to a certain set of PMFs. For this
asynchronous SW coding system, we clarify the achievable rate region which is
the set of rate pairs of encoders such that the decoding error probability
vanishes as the blocklength tends to infinity. We show that this region does
not always coincide with that of the synchronous SW coding system in which each
encoder samples a source sequence without any delay.

  Approximate Probabilistic Relations",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a compositional approach for constructing abstractions of general
Markov decision processes using approximate probabilistic relations. The
abstraction framework is based on the notion of $\delta$-lifted relations,
using which one can quantify the distance in probability between the
interconnected gMDPs and that of their abstractions. This new approximate
relation unifies compositionality results in the literature by incorporating
the dependencies between state transitions explicitly and by allowing abstract
models to have either finite or infinite state spaces. Accordingly, one can
leverage the proposed results to perform analysis and synthesis over abstract
models, and then carry the results over concrete ones. To this end, we first
propose our compositionality results using the new approximate probabilistic
relation which is based on lifting. We then focus on a class of stochastic
nonlinear dynamical systems and construct their abstractions using both model
order reduction and space discretization in a unified framework. We provide
conditions for simultaneous existence of relations incorporating the structure
of the network. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
results by considering a network of four nonlinear dynamical subsystems
(together 12 dimensions) and constructing finite abstractions from their
reduced-order versions (together 4 dimensions) in a unified compositional
framework. We benchmark our results against the compositional abstraction
techniques that construct both infinite abstractions (reduced-order models) and
finite MDPs in two consecutive steps. We show that our approach is much less
conservative than the ones available in the literature.

networks. Despite of tremendous successes in practice, its theoretical
properties still remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we provide new
theoretical insights of gradient descent based adversarial training by studying
its computational properties, specifically on its inductive bias. We take the
binary classification task on linearly separable data as an illustrative
example, where the loss asymptotically attains its infimum as the parameter
diverges to infinity along certain directions. Specifically, we show that when
the adversarial perturbation during training has bounded $\ell_2$-norm, the
classifier learned by gradient descent based adversarial training converges in
direction to the maximum $\ell_2$-norm margin classifier at the rate of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$, significantly faster than the rate
$\mathcal{O}(1/\log T)$ of training with clean data. In addition, when the
adversarial perturbation during training has bounded $\ell_q$-norm for some
$q\ge 1$, the resulting classifier converges in direction to a maximum
mixed-norm margin classifier, which has a natural interpretation of robustness,
as being the maximum $\ell_2$-norm margin classifier under worst-case
$\ell_q$-norm perturbation to the data. Our findings provide theoretical
backups for adversarial training that it indeed promotes robustness against
adversarial perturbation.

assisting domain wall is created by interlayer exchange coupling. The
field-free deterministic switching is achieved by the movement of the domain

predicting exact pixel values of the target patches. The pretraining
architecture of Selfie includes a network of convolutional blocks to process
patches followed by an attention pooling network to summarize the content of
unmasked patches before predicting masked ones. During finetuning, we reuse the
convolutional weights found by pretraining. We evaluate Selfie on three

approximates well the actual FW line. This new criterion defines a line where
the isothermal compressibility takes its ideal gas value
$\chi_T=\chi_T^\text{id}$. We test our hypothesis by considering four commonly
used models for simple fluids. In all cases the new criterion yields a line in
the phase diagram that is close to the actual FW line for the thermodynamic
state points that are most relevant. We also investigate (Widom) lines of
maximal correlation length, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing

planer F phase robustly remains. We study the properties of the phase
boundaries by employing finite-size-scaling analyses. We find that the slope of
the spin-reorientation-transition line is positive with and without field,
i.e., $\frac{d\eta}{dT}>0$, which implies that the planar F phase changes to
the SO phase with lowering temperature. In the phase diagrams we observe a
characteristic shape of the P--planer F phase-transition line, whose maximum
point of $\eta$ is located at an intermediate temperature. This structure leads
to the temperature-induced reentrant transition associated with P and planar F

timeliness, but so far the potential for clinical implementations has been
largely limited to studies in intensive care units. This study will employ a
richer data set that will expand the applicability of these models beyond
intensive care units. Furthermore, we will circumvent several important
limitations that have been found in the literature: 1) Models are evaluated
shortly before sepsis onset without considering interventions already
initiated. 2) Machine learning models are built on a restricted set of clinical
parameters, which are not necessarily measured in all departments. 3) Model
performance is limited by current knowledge of sepsis, as feature interactions
and time dependencies are hardcoded into the model. In this study, we present a
model to overcome these shortcomings using a deep learning approach on a
diverse multicenter data set. We used retrospective data from multiple Danish
hospitals over a seven-year period. Our sepsis detection system is constructed
as a combination of a convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory
network. We suggest a retrospective assessment of interventions by looking at
intravenous antibiotics and blood cultures preceding the prediction time.
Results show performance ranging from AUROC 0.856 (3 hours before sepsis onset)
to AUROC 0.756 (24 hours before sepsis onset). We present a deep learning

density computed from an effective temperature functional which depends on the
state of the observer. The two ways of computing these quantities show a
mismatch at the light ring outside the black hole horizon. To better understand
this ambiguity, we show that even taking into account the (minor) breakdown of
the adiabatic evolution of the temperature functional which has a peak in the
same region of the mismatch, is not enough to remove it. We argue that the
appearance of this discrepancy can be traced back to the process of particle
creation by showing how the Wentzel--Kramers--Brillouin approximation for the
field modes breaks down between the light ring at $3M$ and $4M$, with a peak at
$r=3.3M$ exactly where the energy density mismatch is maximized. We hence
conclude that these facts strongly support a scenario where the Hawking flux

Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning offer new opportunities to
optimizing processes. The presented approach demonstrates an improvement of the
test process by using Machine Learning as a support tool for test management.
The scope is the semi-automation of the selection of regression tests. The
proposed lean testing process uses Machine Learning as a supporting machine,
while keeping the human test manager in charge of the adequate test case
selection. 1 Introduction Many established long running projects and programs
are execute regression tests during the release tests. The regression tests are
the part of the release test to ensure that functionality from past releases
still works fine in the new release. In many projects, a significant part of
these regression tests are not automated and therefore executed manually.
Manual tests are expensive and time intensive [1], which is why often only a
relevant subset of all possible regression tests are executed in order to safe
time and money. Depending on the software process, different approaches can be
used to identify the right set of regression tests. The source code file level
is a frequent entry point for this identification [2]. Advanced approaches
combine different file level methods [3]. To handle black-box tests, methods
like [4] or [5] can be used for test case prioritiza-tion. To decide which
tests can be skipped, a relevance ranking of the tests in a regression test
suite is needed. Based on the relevance a test is in or out of the regression
test set for a specific release. This decision is a task of the test manager
supported by experts. The task can be time-consuming in case of big (often a
4-to 5-digit number) regression test suites because the selection is specific
to each release. Trends are going to continuous prioritization [6], which this
work wants to support with the presented ML based approach for black box
regression test case prioritization. Any regression test selection is made upon
release specific changes. Changes can be new or deleted code based on
refactoring or implementation of new features. But also changes on externals
systems which are connected by interfaces have to be considered

stochastic arrival processes, remain on the roundabout a random number of
cells, and depart via off-ramps. Importantly, the model does not oversimplify
the dynamics of traffic on roundabouts, while various performance-related
quantities (such as delay and queue length) allow an analytical
characterization. In particular, we present an explicit expression for the
marginal stationary distribution of each cell on the lattice. Moreover, we
derive results that give insight on the dependencies between parts of the
roundabout, and on the queue distribution. Finally, we find scaling limits that
allow, for every partition of the roundabout in segments, to approximate 1) the
joint distribution of the occupation of these segments by a multivariate
Gaussian distribution; and 2) the joint distribution of their total queue
lengths by a collection of independent Poisson random variables. To verify the
scaling limit statements, we develop a novel way to empirically assess
convergence in distribution of random variables.

improve the data accuracy and reduce both the participant burden and the health
costs. In this paper, we propose a novel system based on artificial
intelligence to accurately estimate nutrient intake, by simply processing RGB
depth image pairs captured before and after a meal consumption. For the
development and evaluation of the system, a dedicated and new database of
images and recipes of 322 meals was assembled, coupled to data annotation using
innovative strategies. With this database, a system was developed that employed
a novel multi-task neural network and an algorithm for 3D surface construction.
This allowed sequential semantic food segmentation and estimation of the volume
of the consumed food, and permitted fully automatic estimation of nutrient
intake for each food type with a 15% estimation error.

underlying land surface is an important research problem in the geosciences. In
order to model this interaction adequately, it is necessary to develop tools
which can describe it quantitatively. Commonly employed methods, such as bulk
flow statistics, are known to be insufficient for this task, especially when
land surfaces with equal aggregate statistics but different spatial patterns
are involved. While geometrical properties of the surface forcing have a strong
influence on flow structure, it is precisely those properties that get
neglected when computing bulk statistics. Here, we present a set of descriptors
based on low-level topological information (i.\,e. connectivity), and show how
these can be used both in the structural analysis of the CBL and in modeling
its response to differences in surface forcing. The topological property of
connectivity is not only easier to compute than its higher-dimensional
homological counterparts, but also has a natural relation to the physical
concept of a coherent structure.

from its trap when the ambient pressure becomes comparable with or smaller than
a critical value, even if the particle motion is cooled by one of the feedback
(or cavity) cooling schemes realized so far. The critical ambient pressure may
be so small that it is not a limiting factor in ground-state cooling, but
critical feedback cooling rates, which are also introduced, are limiting
factors. The particle escapes from its trap if any of the feedback cooling
rates becomes comparable with or larger than its critical value. Critical
feedback cooling rate is different from the well-known manifestation of the
measurement noise. The critical feedback cooling rate corresponding to a
certain component of the particle motion is usually smaller than the optimum
feedback cooling rate at which the standard quantum limit happens unless that
component is cooled by the Coulomb force (instead of the optical gradient
force). Also, given that the measurement noise for the z component is smaller
than the measurement noises for the other two components (assuming that the
beam illuminating the particle for photodetection propagates parallel to the z
axis), the feedback scheme in which the z component of the particle motion is
cooled by the Coulomb force has the best performance. This conclusion is in
agreement with the experimental results published after writing the first
version of this paper. The dependence of the critical ambient pressure, the
critical feedback cooling rates, and the minimum achievable mean phonon numbers
on the parameters of the system is derived, and can be verified experimentally.

Sigmoid Loss (CMSL) with deep learning (DL) and localize possible cancer lesion
by COrrelation Attention Map (COAM) based on the learned features. The CMSL
embeds tumor features onto a hypersphere and imposes a decision margin through
cosine constraints. In this way, the DL model could learn more separable
inter-class features and more compact intra-class features in the angular
space. Furthermore, we utilize the correlations among feature vectors to
generate attention maps that could accurately localize cancer candidates with
only image-level label. We build the largest breast cancer dataset involving
10,290 DCE-MRI scan volumes for developing and evaluating the proposed methods.
The model driven by CMSL achieved classification accuracy of 0.855 and AUC of
0.902 on the testing set, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.857 and 0.852,

solar rotation period is found in all the activity indicators, with the only
exception being H$\delta$. The derived values vary from 26.29 days (H$\gamma$

that in most of the activity indicators the spectral power is split into
several ""bands"" of periods around 26 and 30 days, that might be explained by
the migration of active regions between the equator and a latitude of $\sim$
30$^{\circ}$, spot evolution or a combination of both effects. In agreement
with previous works a typical lifetime of active regions of $\sim$ ten rotation
periods is inferred from the pooled variance diagrams. We find that H$\alpha$,
H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, H$\epsilon$, and He I show a significant correlation with
the S index. Significant correlations between the contrast, bisector span, and
the heliocentric radial velocity with the activity indexes are also found. We
show that the full width at half maximum, the bisector, and the disc-integrated
magnetic field correlate with the radial velocity variations. The correlation
of the S index and H$\alpha$ changes with time, increasing with larger sun spot
numbers and solar irradiance. A similar tendency with the S index - radial
velocity correlation is also present in the data. Our results are consistent
with a scenario in which higher activity favours the correlation between the S

velocity variations.

Density Estimation, it only considers samples of the model which are close to
training data records. The second attack specifically targets Variational
Autoencoders, achieving high membership inference accuracy. Furthermore,
previous work mostly considers membership inference adversaries who perform
single record membership inference. We argue for considering regulatory actors
who perform set membership inference to identify the use of specific datasets
for training. The attacks are evaluated on two generative model architectures,
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
trained on standard image datasets. Our results show that the two attacks yield
success rates superior to previous work on most data sets while at the same

answer re-ranking. The re-ranking leverages different features that are
directly extracted from the QA pipeline, i.e., a combination of retrieval and

  problem",,,,,"math.NA physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent analysis of the divergence constraint in the incompressible
Stokes/Navier--Stokes problem has stressed the importance of equivalence
classes of forces and how it plays a fundamental role for an accurate space
discretization. Two forces in the momentum balance are velocity--equivalent if
they lead to the same velocity solution, i.e., if and only if the forces differ
by only a gradient field. Pressure-robust space discretizations are designed to
respect these equivalence classes. One way to achieve pressure-robust schemes
is to introduce a non-standard discretization of the right-side forcing term
for any inf-sup stable mixed finite element method. This modification leads to
pressure-robust and optimal-order discretizations, but a proof was only
available for smooth situations and remained open in the case of minimal
regularity, where it cannot be assumed that the vector Laplacian of the
velocity is at least square-integrable. This contribution closes this gap by
delivering a general estimate for the consistency error that depends only on
the regularity of the data term. Pressure-robustness of the estimate is
achieved by the fact that the new estimate only depends on the $L^2$ norm of
the Helmholtz--Hodge projector of the data term and not on the $L^2$ norm of
the entire data term. Numerical examples illustrate the theory.

spectral regions that can be independently mode-locked. Spectral overlap of the
two pulse trains is achieved outside the laser cavity by amplifying the 1030-nm
pulses and broadening them in a nonlinear fiber. Spatially overlapping the two
arms on a simple photodiode then generates a down-converted radio frequency
comb. The difference in repetition rates between the two pulse trains and hence
the line spacing of the down-converted comb can easily be tuned in this setup.
This feature allows for a flexible adjustment of the tradeoff between
non-aliasing bandwidth vs. measurement time in spectroscopy applications.
Furthermore, we show that by fine-tuning the center-wavelengths of the two
pulse trains, we are able to shift the down-converted frequency comb along the
radio-frequency axis. The usability of this dual-comb setup is demonstrated by
measuring the transmission of two different etalons while the laser is

implicitly the mass range between a few 100 GeV up to, say, roughly 2 TeV, such
that these particles can be searched for at the LHC. We study decay widths of
these mediators for several different tree-level neutrino mass models. The
models we consider range from the simplest $d=5$ seesaw up to $d=11$ neutrino
mass models. For each of the models we identify the most interesting parts of
the parameter space, where the heavy mediator fields are particularly
long-lived and can decay with experimentally measurable decay lengths. One has
to distinguish two different scenarios, depending on whether fermions or
scalars are the lighter of the heavy particles. For fermions we find that the
decay lengths correlate with the inverse of the overall neutrino mass scale.
Thus, since no lower limit on the lightest neutrino mass exists, nearly
arbitrarily long decay lengths can be obtained for the case where fermions are
the lighter of the heavy particles. For charged scalars, on the other hand,
there exists a maximum value for the decay length. This maximum value depends
on the model and on the electric charge of the scalar under consideration, but
can at most be of the order of a few millimeters. Interestingly, independent of
the model, this maximum occurs always in a region of parameter space, where
leptonic and gauge boson final states have similar branching ratios, i.e. where
the observation of lepton number violating final states from scalar decays is
possible.

carboxylic acid modified multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT-COOH) was dropped
on the nanofibers and allowed to dry at RT. Next, the thin films were
characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM),
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Finally, chemical sensing behaviors of the
sensors were analyzed against to ethanol (ETH), toluene (TOL),
trichloroethylene (TCE), acetone (ACE) and binary mixing with water. It was
demonstrated that increasing the temperature and gas concentration has led to
increased sensor response for SnO2-Pd nanofiber system. However, there was no

active research area in mobile and pervasive computing for several years. While
the majority of the proposed techniques are based on supervised learning,
semi-supervised approaches are being considered to significantly reduce the

approaches usually apply self-training or active learning to incrementally
refine the model, but their effectiveness seems to be limited to a restricted

recognized activities including those that are difficult to discriminate only
considering inertial sensors, and the ones that are highly context-dependent.
In this paper, we propose CAVIAR, a novel hybrid semi-supervised and

semantic reasoning to context data to refine the prediction of a
semi-supervised classifier. The context-refined predictions are used as new
labeled samples to update the classifier combining self-training and active

the effectiveness of the context-aware approach both on the recognition rates

CAVIAR with a purely statistical version, considering features computed on

(BAO) in galaxy surveys make use of a fiducial cosmological model to guide the
data compression required to transform from observed redshifts and angles to
the measured angular and radial BAO peak positions. In order to remove any
dependence on the fiducial cosmology from the results, all models compared to
the data should mimic the compression and its dependence on the fiducial model.
In practice, approximations are made when testing models: (1) There is assumed
to be no residual dependence on the fiducial cosmology after reconstruction,
(2) differences in the distance--redshift relationship are assumed to match a
linear scaling, and (3) differences in clustering between true and fiducial
models are assumed to be removed by the free parameters used to null the
non-BAO signal. We test these approximations using the current standard
measurement procedure with a set of halo catalogs from the {\sc Aemulus} suite
of $N$-body simulations, which span a range of $w\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmological
models. We focus on reconstruction of the primordial BAO and locating the BAO.
For the range of $w\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmologies covered by the {\sc Aemulus}
suite, we find no evidence for systematic errors in the measured BAO shift
parameters $\alpha_{\parallel}$ and $\alpha_{\bot}$ to $< 0.1\%$. However, the
measured errors $\sigma_{\alpha_{\parallel}}$ and $\sigma_{\alpha_{\bot}}$ show
a notable absolute increase by up to $+0.001$ and $+0.002$ respectively in the
case that the fiducial cosmology does not match the truth. These effects on the
inferred BAO scale will be important given the precision of measurements
expected from future surveys including DESI, Euclid, and WFIRST.

registration methods often repeatedly conduct the independent iterative search
of desired geometric transformation to align the source point set with the
target one. This limits their use in applications to handle the real-time point
set registration with large volume dataset. This paper presents a novel method,
named coherent point drift networks (CPD-Net), for the unsupervised learning of
geometric transformation towards real-time non-rigid point set registration. In
contrast to previous efforts (e.g. coherent point drift), CPD-Net can learn
displacement field function to estimate geometric transformation from a
training dataset, consequently, to predict the desired geometric transformation
for the alignment of previously unseen pairs without any additional iterative
optimization process. Furthermore, CPD-Net leverages the power of deep neural
networks to fit an arbitrary function, that adaptively accommodates different
levels of complexity of the desired geometric transformation. Particularly,
CPD-Net is proved with a theoretical guarantee to learn a continuous
displacement vector function that could further avoid imposing additional
parametric smoothness constraint as in previous works. Our experiments verify
the impressive performance of CPD-Net for non-rigid point set registration on
various 2D/3D datasets, even in the presence of significant displacement noise,

when an extreme event is imminent. When actuated, the controller only acts on
the degrees of freedom that are involved in the formation of the extreme

attractors of the controlled and uncontrolled systems share the same chaotic

may engage in the natural sciences and in metaphysics under the restriction
that certain conditions are imposed on our cognition of objects. Underlying
Kant's doctrine, however, is an ontological posit, of a sort, regarding the
fundamental nature of our cognition. This posit, sometimes called the
`discursivity thesis', while considered to be completely obvious and
uncontroversial by some, has nevertheless been denied by thinkers both before

who, despite his rejection of discursivity, also advocated for a
metaphilosophical understanding of critical philosophy. As I will explain, a
consequence for Fries of the denial of discursivity is a radical
reconceptualisation of the method of critical philosophy; whereas this method
is a priori for Kant, for Fries it is in general empirical. I discuss these
issues in the context of quantum theory, and I focus in particular on the views
of the physicist Niels Bohr and the Neo-Friesian philosopher Grete Hermann. I
argue that Bohr's understanding of quantum mechanics can be seen as a natural
extension of an orthodox Kantian viewpoint in the face of the challenges posed

want to check and/or retrieve in an XML document. When they are applied to a
semi-structured document or to a document with an overly complex model, the
lack or the ignorance of the explicit document model (DTD-Document Type
Definition, Schema, etc.) increases the risk of ob-taining an empty result set
when the query is too specific, or, too large result set when it is too vague
(e.g. it contains wildcards such as ""*""). The reason is that in both cases,
users write queries according to the document model they have in mind; this can
be very far from the one that can actually be extracted from the document.
Opposed to exact queries, preference queries are more flexible and can be
relaxed to expand the search space during their evalua-tions. Indeed, during
their evaluation, certain constraints (the preferences they contain) can be
relaxed if necessary to avoid precisely empty results; moreover, the returned
answers can be filtered to retain only the best ones. This paper presents an
algorithm for evaluating such queries inspired by the TreeMatch algorithm
proposed by Yao et al. for exact queries. In the pro-posed algorithm, the best
answers are obtained by using an adaptation of the Skyline operator (defined in
relational databases) in the context of documents (trees) to incrementally
filter into the partial solutions set, those which satisfy the maximum of

sender-receiver configuration can exhibit anticipated synchronization (AS) if
the Receiver neuron (R) also receives a delayed negative self-feedback.
Recently, AS was shown to occur in a three-neuron motif with standard chemical
synapses where the delayed inhibition was provided by an interneuron. Here we
show that a two-neuron model in the presence of an inhibitory autapse, which is
a massive self-innervation present in the cortical architecture, may present
AS. The GABAergic autapse regulates the internal dynamics of the Receiver
neuron and acts as the negative delayed self-feedback required by dynamical
systems in order to exhibit AS. In this biologically plausible scenario, a
smooth transition from the usual delayed synchronization (DS) to AS typically
occurs when the inhibitory conductance is increased. The phenomenon is shown to
be robust when model parameters are varied within a physiological range. For
extremely large values of the inhibitory autapse the system undergoes to a
phase-drift regime in which the Receiver is faster than the Sender.
Furthermore, we show that the inhibitory autapse promotes a faster internal
dynamics of the free-running Receiver when the two neurons are uncoupled, which
could be the mechanism underlying anticipated synchronization and the DS-AS
transition.

measured by local field potentials (LFPs) or electroencephalography (EEG) - are
of capital importance, as they allow to simultaneously obtain data from
multiple neurons. The exact biophysical basis of these signals is, however,
still not fully understood. Most models for the extracellular potential today
are based on volume conductor theory, which assumes that the extracellular
fluid is electroneutral and that the only contributions to the electric field
are given by membrane currents, which can be imposed as boundary conditions in
the mathematical model. This neglects a second, possibly important contributor
to the extracellular field: the time- and position-dependent concentrations of
ions in the intra- and extracellular fluids. In this thesis, a 3D model of a
single axon in extracellular fluid is presented based on the
Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations of electrodiffusion. This fundamental
model includes not only the potential, but also the concentrations of all
participating ion concentrations in a self-consistent way. This enables us to
study the propagation of an action potential (AP) along the axonal membrane
based on first principles by means of numerical simulations. By exploiting the
cylinder symmetry of this geometry, the problem can be reduced to two
dimensions. The numerical solution is implemented in a flexible and efficient
way, using the DUNE framework. A suitable mesh generation strategy and a
parallelization of the algorithm allow to solve the problem in reasonable time,
with a high spatial and temporal resolution. The methods and programming
techniques used to deal with the numerical challenges of this multi-scale

shown to be much less efficient for complex organic molecules, such as
methanol, because mostly photoproducts are ejected. The induced photolysis

efficiency to desorb intact molecules. We investigate the sputtering efficiency
of complex organic molecules that are observed either in the ice mantles of
interstellar dense clouds directly by infrared spectroscopy (CH3OH), or that
are observed in the gas phase by millimeter telescopes (CH3COOCH3) and that
could be released from interstellar grain surfaces. We irradiated ice films

with swift heavy ions in the electronic sputtering regime. We monitored the
infrared spectra of the film as well as the species released to the gas phase

is embedded in a water-ice mantle exposed to cosmic rays, a large portion is
sputtered as an intact molecule, with a sputtering yield close to that of the
main water-ice matrix. This must be even more true for more volatile ice
matrices, such as those that are embedded in carbon monoxide. Cosmic rays
penetrating deep into dense clouds provide an efficient mechanism to desorb
complex organic molecules. Compared to VUV photons induced by the interaction

Recently, the prime compilation for non-clausal formulae has received great
attention. The state-of-the-art approaches generate all primes along with a
prime cover constructed by prime implicates using dual rail encoding. However,
the dual rail encoding potentially expands search space. In addition,
constructing a prime cover, which is necessary for their methods, is
time-consuming. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-phase method --
CoAPI. The two phases are the key to construct a cover without using dual rail
encoding. Specifically, given a non-clausal formula, we first propose a
core-guided method to rewrite the non-clausal formula into a cover constructed
by over-approximate implicates in the first phase. Then, we generate all the
primes based on the cover in the second phase. In order to reduce the size of
the cover, we provide a multi-order based shrinking method, with a good
tradeoff between the small size and efficiency, to compress the size of cover
considerably. The experimental results show that CoAPI outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches. Particularly, for generating all prime implicates,
CoAPI consumes about one order of magnitude less time.

previous relation extraction models, TRE uses pre-trained deep language
representations instead of explicit linguistic features to inform the relation

characterized by vast individual and contextual heterogeneity. To achieve
meaningful human-computer and human-robot interactions, multi-modal models of
the users states (e.g., engagement) are therefore needed. Most of the existing
works that try to build classifiers for the users states assume that the data
to train the models are fully labeled. Nevertheless, data labeling is costly
and tedious, and also prone to subjective interpretations by the human coders.
This is even more pronounced when the data are multi-modal (e.g., some users
are more expressive with their facial expressions, some with their voice).
Thus, building models that can accurately estimate the users states during an
interaction is challenging. To tackle this, we propose a novel multi-modal
active learning (AL) approach that uses the notion of deep reinforcement
learning (RL) to find an optimal policy for active selection of the users data,
needed to train the target (modality-specific) models. We investigate different
strategies for multi-modal data fusion, and show that the proposed model-level
fusion coupled with RL outperforms the feature-level and modality-specific
models, and the naive AL strategies such as random sampling, and the standard
heuristics such as uncertainty sampling. We show the benefits of this approach
on the task of engagement estimation from real-world child-robot interactions
during an autism therapy. Importantly, we show that the proposed multi-modal AL
approach can be used to efficiently personalize the engagement classifiers to
the target user using a small amount of actively selected users data.

for some cases the requested set of paths cannot be implemented without adding

nonequilibrium nature they maintain nontrivial particle fluxes even at the
steady state. Here we suggest how to overcome this problem and formulate a
method for engineering reconfigurable networks of nonequilibrium condensates
with control of individual pairwise interactions. Representing spin by
condensate phase, the effective two spin interactions are created with
nonresonant pumping, are directed with dissipative channels, and are further
controlled with dissipative gates. The dissipative barriers are used to block
unwanted interactions between condensates. Together, spatial anisotropy of
dissipation and pump profiles allow an effective control of sign and intensity
of the coupling strength between any two neighboring sites independent of the
rest of the spins, which we demonstrate with a two dimensional square lattice
of polariton condensates. Experimental realisation of such fully-controllable
networks offers great potential for an efficient analog Hamiltonian optimizer

rekindling the interest in fast calculations of the radiative transfer. Aims.
We revisit the Opacity Distribution Functions (ODF) approach routinely applied
to speedup stellar spectral synthesis. To achieve a considerable speedup
relative to the current state-of-the-art, we further optimize the approach and
search for the best ODF configuration. Furthermore, we generalize the ODF
approach for fast calculations of flux in various filters often used in stellar
observations. Methods. In a parameter-sweep-fashion, we generated ODF in the
spectral range from UV to IR with different setups. The most accurate ODF
configuration for each spectral interval was determined. For calculations of
the radiative fluxes through filters we adapted the wavelength grid based on
the transmission curve, whereafter the normal ODF procedure was performed.
Results. Our optimum ODF configuration allows for a three fold speedup,
compared to the previously used ODF configurations. The ODF generalization to
calculate fluxes through filters results in a speedup of more than two orders

  2021","10.1145/3446216",,"cs.DS cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There has been a rise in the popularity of algebraic methods for graph
algorithms given the development of the GraphBLAS library and other sparse
matrix methods. An exemplar for these approaches is Breadth-First Search (BFS).
The algebraic BFS algorithm is simply a recurrence of matrix-vector
multiplications with the $n \times n$ adjacency matrix, but the many redundant
operations over nonzeros ultimately lead to suboptimal performance. Therefore
an optimal algebraic BFS should be of keen interest especially if it is easily
integrated with existing matrix methods.
  Current methods, notably in the GraphBLAS, use a Sparse Matrix masked-Sparse
Vector (SpMmSpV) multiplication in which the input vector is kept in a sparse
representation in each step of the BFS, and nonzeros in the vector are masked
in subsequent steps. This has been an area of recent research in GraphBLAS and
other libraries. While in theory these masking methods are asymptotically
optimal on sparse graphs, many add work that leads to suboptimal runtime. We
give a new optimal, algebraic BFS for sparse graphs, thus closing a gap in the
literature.
  Our method multiplies progressively smaller submatrices of the adjacency
matrix at each step. Let $n$ and $m$ refer to the number of vertices and edges,
respectively. On a sparse graph, our method takes $O(n)$ algebraic operations
as opposed to $O(m)$ operations needed by theoretically optimal sparse matrix
approaches. Thus for sparse graphs it matches the bounds of the best-known
sequential algorithm and on a Parallel Random Access Machine (PRAM) it is
work-optimal. Our result holds for both directed and undirected graphs.
Compared to a leading GraphBLAS library our method achieves up to 24x faster
sequential time and for parallel computation it can be 17x faster on large
graphs and 12x faster on large-diameter graphs.

graph normed domain of an unbounded operator that maps final states to the
corresponding initial states, and the resulting compatibility condition extends
to the coercive context. Lax--Milgram operators in vector distribution spaces
is the main framework, but the crucial tool that analytic semigroups always are
invertible in the class of closed operators is extended to unbounded

(1998) developed an upper bound on the generalization error of an ensemble
based on the margins of the training data, from which it was concluded that
larger margins should lead to lower generalization error, everything else being
equal. Many other researchers have backed this assumption and presented tighter

(Anti-)deuterons are identified via their specific energy loss
$\rm{d}E/\rm{d}x$ and via their time-of-flight. Their production in p-Pb
collisions is compared to pp and Pb-Pb collisions and is discussed within the
context of thermal and coalescence models. The ratio of integrated yields of
deuterons to protons (d/p) shows a significant increase as a function of the
charged-particle multiplicity of the event starting from values similar to
those observed in pp collisions at low multiplicities and approaching those
observed in Pb-Pb collisions at high multiplicities. The mean transverse
momenta are extracted from the deuteron spectra and the values are similar to
those obtained for p and $\Lambda$ particles. Thus, deuteron spectra do not
follow mass ordering. This behaviour is in contrast to the trend observed for
non-composite particles in p-Pb collisions. In addition, the production of the
rare $^{3}{\rm{He}}$ and $^{3}\bar{\rm He}$ nuclei has been studied. The
spectrum corresponding to all non-single diffractive p-Pb collisions is
obtained in the rapidity window $-1 < y < 0$ and the $p_{\rm{T}}$-integrated
yield d$N$/d$y$ is extracted. It is found that the yields of protons,
deuterons, and $^{3}{\rm{He}}$, normalised by the spin degeneracy factor,
follow an exponential decrease with mass number.

learning non-differentiable parameters of large supervised models. ES are
black-box optimization algorithms that estimate distributions of model
parameters; however they have only been used for relatively small problems so
far. We show that it is possible to scale ES to more complex tasks and models
with millions of parameters. While using ES for differentiable parameters is
computationally impractical (although possible), we show that a hybrid approach
is practically feasible in the case where the model has both differentiable and
non-differentiable parameters. In this approach we use standard gradient-based
methods for learning differentiable weights, while using ES for learning
non-differentiable parameters - in our case sparsity masks of the weights. This
proposed method is surprisingly competitive, and when parallelized over
multiple devices has only negligible training time overhead compared to
training with gradient descent. Additionally, this method allows to train
sparse models from the first training step, so they can be much larger than
when using methods that require training dense models first. We present results

superfluid components that can significantly affect their dynamics. The
description of such objects should rely on hydrodynamic models in which it is
possible to unambiguously assign the value of the thermodynamic variables from
microscopic calculations of the properties of matter. In this work we consider
the phenomenological approach to multifluids modelling championed by Carter
and, studying the relaxation of the system towards equilibrium, we assign a
precise thermodynamic interpretation to its variables. We show that in
thermodynamic equilibrium the equation of state contains less state variables
than those needed in the phenomenological model, implying the existence of a
gauge freedom of the theory that can be used to simplify the hydrodynamic
formulation in the non-dissipative limit. Once this is understood, it becomes
easy to translate the different multifluid formalisms that have been proposed
in the literature into Carter's form. Finally, we show that the usual concepts
of affinity and reaction coordinates, as they are introduced in chemistry, are
not affected by the presence of superfluid currents. In an effort to make the
concepts clear, the formalism is developed step-by-step from first principles,
providing model examples and several applications of practical relevance for
the study of superfluid neutron star interiors.

While it loosely resembles the Neumann and Kirchhoff models, its equations may
be viewed as the Euler equations for a centrally extended Euclidean algebra.
The model has a Lax pair and r-matrix leading to four generically independent
conserved quantities in involution, two of which are Casimirs. Their level sets
define four-dimensional symplectic leaves on which the system is Liouville
integrable. On each of these leaves, the common level sets of the remaining
conserved quantities are shown, in general, to be 2-tori. The non-generic level
sets can only be horn tori, circles and points. They correspond to measure zero
subsets where the conserved quantities develop relations and solutions
degenerate from elliptic to hyperbolic, circular or constant functions. A
geometric construction allows us to realize each common level set as a bundle
with base determined by the roots of a cubic polynomial. A dynamics is defined
on the union of each type of level set, with the corresponding phase manifolds
expressed as bundles over spaces of conserved quantities. Interestingly,
topological transitions in energy hypersurfaces are found to occur at energies
corresponding to horn tori, which support purely homoclinic orbits. The
dynamics on each horn torus is non-Hamiltonian, but expressed as a gradient
flow. Finally, we discover a family of action-angle variables for the system

In order to provide reliable communication within the SDN driven data-planes,
assuring that the implemented data-paths are the requested (and expected) ones

data-paths in the data-plane. In SDN, different applications may configure
different coexisting data-paths, the resulting data-paths a specific network

may be defected or compromised. We focus on discovering the operational
data-paths on SDN driven data-planes. However, the proposed approach is
applicable to any data-plane where the operational data-paths must be verified

variables conditional on covariate information have become an important aspect
of contemporary regression analysis. However, a limitation of such models is
that they often rely on rather simplistic assumptions, e.g. a constant
dependency structure that is not allowed to vary with the covariates or the
restriction to linear dependence between the responses only. We propose a
general framework for multivariate conditional transformation models that
overcomes these limitations and describes the entire distribution in a
tractable and interpretable yet flexible way conditional on nonlinear effects
of covariates. The framework can be embedded into likelihood-based inference,
including results on asymptotic normality, and allows the dependence structure
to vary with covariates. In addition, the framework scales well beyond
bivariate response situations, which were the main focus of most earlier
investigations. We illustrate the application of multivariate conditional

predict CGA presence from the same population. A third model was trained to
predict CGA presence from the subset of eyes with GA. For training and testing,

achieving high spectrum and energy efficiency in future wireless networks by
leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect the

continuous phase shifts at reflecting elements, which are practically difficult
to implement due to the hardware limitation. In contrast, we study in this
paper an IRS-aided wireless network, where an IRS with only a finite number of
phase shifts at each element is deployed to assist in the communication from a
multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna users. We aim to
minimize the transmit power at the AP by jointly optimizing the continuous
transmit precoding at the AP and the discrete reflect phase shifts at the IRS,
subject to a given set of minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) constraints at the user receivers. The considered problem is shown to be
a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) and thus is difficult to solve in
general. To tackle this problem, we first study the single-user case with one
user assisted by the IRS and propose both optimal and suboptimal algorithms for
solving it. Besides, we analytically show that as compared to the ideal case
with continuous phase shifts, the IRS with discrete phase shifts achieves the
same squared power gain in terms of asymptotically large number of reflecting
elements, while a constant proportional power loss is incurred that depends
only on the number of phase-shift levels. The proposed designs for the
single-user case are also extended to the general setup with multiple users
among which some are aided by the IRS. Simulation results verify our
performance analysis as well as the effectiveness of our proposed designs as

discovered that the analogy with Brownian dynamics breaks down when considering
the directional components of the velocity. For the vectorial components,
neither the equipartition theorem, nor the Einstein relation is obeyed.
Moreover, the kinetic energy estimated from the random walk of individual
objects is one order of magnitude higher than the value estimated from
Boltzmann statistics on the interaction between two spheres with embedded

  At each jump, the random walker is subject to a drift that depends on whether
it is sitting on top of a particle or a hole, so that its asymptotic behavior
is expected to depend on the density $\rho \in [0, 1]$ of the underlying SSEP.
  Our first result is a law of large numbers (LLN) for the random walker for
all densities $\rho$ except for at most two values $\rho_-, \rho_+ \in [0, 1]$.
  The asymptotic speed we obtain in our LLN is a monotone function of $\rho$.
  Also, $\rho_-$ and $\rho_+$ are characterized as the two points at which the
speed may jump to (or from) zero.
  Furthermore, for all the values of densities where the random walk
experiences a non-zero speed, we can prove that it satisfies a functional
central limit theorem (CLT).
  For the special case in which the density is $1/2$ and the jump distribution
on an empty site and on an occupied site are symmetric to each other, we prove
a LLN with zero limiting speed.
  Finally, we prove similar LLN and CLT results for a different environment,

linked to substantial property and infrastructural damage and are responsible
for the largest spatially aggregated financial losses. Such extreme winds are
typically generated by extratropical cyclone systems originating in the North
Atlantic and passing over Europe. Previous statistical studies tend to model
extreme winds at a given set of sites, corresponding to inference in a Eulerian
framework. Such inference cannot incorporate knowledge of the life cycle and
progression of extratropical cyclones across the region and is forced to make
restrictive assumptions about the extremal dependence structure. We take an
entirely different approach which overcomes these limitations by working in a
Lagrangian framework. Specifically, we model the development of windstorms over
time, preserving the physical characteristics linking the windstorm and the
cyclone track, the path of local vorticity maxima, and make a key finding that
the spatial extent of extratropical windstorms becomes more localised as its
magnitude increases irrespective of the location of the storm track. Our model
allows simulation of synthetic windstorm events to derive the joint
distributional features over any set of sites giving physically consistent
extrapolations to rarer events. From such simulations improved estimates of

power a global, eruptive superflare that releases approximately the same energy

understanding the motivations, behavior, and basic parameters that govern the

ensembles have been investigated in recent years, but with very limited control
over the network parameters and in noisy environments. In particular, research
has focused predominantly on all-to-all coupling, whereas current social
networks and human interactions are often based on complex coupling
configurations, such as nearest-neighbor coupling and small-world networks.
Because the synchronization of any ensemble is governed by its network
parameters, studying different types of human networks while controlling the
coupling and the delay is essential for understanding the dynamics of different
types of human networks. We studied the synchronization between professional
violin players in complex networks with full control over the network
connectivity, coupling strength of each connection, and delay. We found that
the usual models for coupled networks, such as the Kuramoto model, cannot be
applied to human networks. We found that the players can change their
periodicity by a factor of three to find a stable solution to the coupled
network, or they can delete connections by ignoring frustrating signals. These
additional degrees of freedom enable new strategies and yield better solutions
than are possible within current models. Our results may influence numerous

propose a PoseWarper network that leverages training videos with sparse
annotations (every k frames) to learn to perform dense temporal pose
propagation and estimation. Given a pair of video frames---a labeled Frame A
and an unlabeled Frame B---we train our model to predict human pose in Frame A
using the features from Frame B by means of deformable convolutions to
implicitly learn the pose warping between A and B. We demonstrate that we can
leverage our trained PoseWarper for several applications. First, at inference
time we can reverse the application direction of our network in order to
propagate pose information from manually annotated frames to unlabeled frames.
This makes it possible to generate pose annotations for the entire video given
only a few manually-labeled frames. Compared to modern label propagation
methods based on optical flow, our warping mechanism is much more compact (6M
vs 39M parameters), and also more accurate (88.7% mAP vs 83.8% mAP). We also
show that we can improve the accuracy of a pose estimator by training it on an

manual labels. Lastly, we can use our PoseWarper to aggregate temporal pose
information from neighboring frames during inference. This allows our system to

replace that Gaussian Elimination step, enabling a sizeable speed up in the
solution process. The key idea is to train an ANN with a large set of solutions
of random one-cell transport problems and then to use the trained ANN to
replace Gaussian Elimination large scale transport solvers. It has been
observed that ANNs decrease the solution times by at least a factor of 4, while
introducing mean absolute errors between 1-3 \% in large scale transport
solutions.

histories, as a step towards directly representing states in quantum gravity
via bulk tensor networks. Quantum causal histories are quantum extensions of
causal sets in the sense that on each event in a causal set is assigned a
Hilbert space of quantum states, and the local causal evolutions between events
are modeled by completely positive and trace-preserving maps. Here we utilize
the channel-state duality of completely positive and trace-preserving maps to
transform the causal evolutions to bipartite entangled states. We construct the
matrix product state for a single quantum causal history by projecting the
obtained bipartite states onto the physical states on the events. We also
construct the two dimensional tensor network states for entangled quantum
causal histories in a restricted case with compatible causal orders. The
possible holographic tensor networks are explored by mapping the quantum causal
histories in a way analogous to the exact holographic mapping. The constructed
tensor networks for quantum causal histories are exemplified by the non-unitary
local time evolution moves in a quantum system on temporally varying
discretizations, and these non-unitary evolution moves are shown to be
necessary for defining a bulk causal structure and a quantum black hole.
Finally, we comment on the limitations of the constructed tensor networks, and
discuss some directions for further studies aiming at applications in quantum
gravity.

suitable conjugacy, induced by a novel coupling, E-Capra, that has the property
of being constant along primal rays like the l0 pseudonorm. The coupling
E-Capra belongs to the class of one-sided linear couplings, that we introduce;
we show that they induce conjugacies that share nice properties with the

E-Capra, we relate the E-Capra conjugate and biconjugate of the l0 pseudonorm,
the characteristic functions of its level sets and the sequence of so-called

biconjugate: hence, the l0 pseudonorm is E-Capra-convex in the sense of
generalized convexity. As a corollary, we show that there exists a proper
convex lower semicontinuous function such that this function and the l0

the average value of the cross section from the $P_{c}(4312)$ contribution is
about 1.2 nb/100 MeV, which is consistent with existing rude data at

sharp increase at extreme forward angles, while the differential cross sections

dynamics and surface treatments. The results show that lower purity material
results in a higher fraction of trapped flux and that the trapped flux
sensitivity parameter $S$ is significantly affected by surface treatments but
without much change in the mean free path $l$. We discuss our results within an
overview of published data on the dependencies of $S(l,f)$ on $l$ and frequency
$f$ using theoretical models of rf losses of elastic vortex lines driven by
weak rf currents in the cases of sparse strong pinning defects and collective
pinning by many weak defects. Our analysis shows how multiscale pinning
mechanisms in cavities can result in a maximum in $S(l)$ similar to that
observed by the FNAL and Cornell groups and how pinning characteristics can be
extracted from the experimental data. Here the main contribution to $S$ come
from weak pinning regions at the cavity surface, where dissipative oscillations
along trapped vortices perpendicular to the surface propagate into the bulk
well beyond the layer of rf screening current.

the fundamental tasks is predicting their performance (e.g., scores) on future
exercises, where it is necessary to track each student's knowledge acquisition
during her exercising activities. However, existing approaches can only exploit
the exercising records of students, and the problem of extracting rich
information existed in the exercise's materials (e.g., knowledge concepts,
exercise content) to achieve both precise predictions of student performance
and interpretable analysis of knowledge acquisition remains underexplored. In
this paper, we present a holistic study of student performance prediction. To
directly achieve the primary goal of prediction, we first propose a general
Exercise-Enhanced Recurrent Neural Network (EERNN) framework by exploring both
student's records and the exercise contents. In EERNN, we simply summarize each
student's state into an integrated vector and trace it with a recurrent neural
network, where we design a bidirectional LSTM to learn the encoding of each
exercise's content. For making predictions, we propose two implementations
under EERNN with different strategies, i.e., EERNNM with Markov property and
EERNNA with Attention mechanism. Then, to explicitly track student's knowledge
acquisition on multiple knowledge concepts, we extend EERNN to an explainable
Exercise-aware Knowledge Tracing (EKT) by incorporating the knowledge concept
effects, where the student's integrated state vector is extended to a knowledge
state matrix. In EKT, we further develop a memory network for quantifying how
much each exercise can affect the mastery of students on concepts during the
exercising process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on large-scale
real-world data. The results demonstrate the prediction effectiveness of two
frameworks as well as the superior interpretability of EKT.

the aim to perform parallel transport. Through basic properties of symmetries,
we investigate how the implementations of a midpoint and the involution compare

us to identify transvections, the composition of two symmetries, as a mean to

remarkable effect on carbon budgets and negative economic impacts.
Consequently, a quantification of ecosystem responses to hotter droughts and a
better understanding of the underlying mechanisms is crucial. In this context,
the European hotter drought of the year 2018 may be considered as a key event.
As a first step towards the quantification of its causes and consequences, we

attention from researchers in the last two decades [1-4]. Today, there is an
enhanced emphasis on developing new experimental techniques to capture the
local temperature profiles in gases at rarefied conditions. The main underlying
reason behind this focus is the interesting physics exhibited by gases at these
rarefied conditions, especially in the transition regime. There is the onset of
local thermodynamic disequilibrium, which manifests as velocity slip and
temperature jump [1-4] at the wall. However, there is limited experimental
evidence on understanding these aforementioned phenomena. With the advances in
experimental facilities, it is today possible, at least in principle, to map
the local temperature profiles in gases at rarefied conditions. Molecular
tagging approach is one such technique which has shown the potential to map the
temperature profile in low pressure conditions [5]. In molecular tagging
approach, a very small percentage of tracer molecules are introduced into the
gas of interest, referred as carrier gas. In gas flow studies, the typical
tracers employed are acetone and biacetyl. These tracer molecules, assumed to
be in equilibrium with the carrier gas, are excited with a source of energy at
a specific wavelength, typically a laser. The excited molecules are unstable
and tend to de-excite in a radiative and non-radiative manner, which is
manifested as fluorescence and phosphorescence. Following the deformation with
time of a tagged line permits to obtain the flow velocity. In addition, the
dependence of the phosphorescence and fluorescence intensity to the gas
temperature could also allow to use this technique for local temperature
measurements. The objective of this study is to develop an experimental setup
capable of simultaneously mapping the wall and fluid near-wall temperatures
with the final goal to measure temperature jump at the wall when rarefied
conditions are reached. The originality of this setup shown in Figure 1 is to
