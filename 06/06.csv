a novel and rich form of information which has inspired new types of computers
and communications systems. Many diverse electron spin systems have been
studied with a view to storing quantum information, including molecular
radicals, point defects and impurities in inorganic systems, and quantum dots
in semiconductor devices. In these systems, spin coherence times can exceed
seconds, single spins can be addressed through electrical and optical methods,
and new spin systems with advantageous properties continue to be identified.
Spin ensembles strongly coupled to microwave resonators can, in principle, be
used to store the coherent states of single microwave photons, enabling
so-called microwave quantum memories. We discuss key requirements in realising
such memories, including considerations for superconducting resonators whose
frequency can be tuned onto resonance with the spins. Finally, progress towards
microwave quantum memories and other developments in the field of
superconducting quantum devices are being used to push the limits of
sensitivity of inductively-detected electron spin resonance. The
state-of-the-art currently stands at around 65 spins per root-Hz, with
prospects to scale down to even fewer spins.

and logarithmic scalar self-interaction potentials as benchmarks. We perform a
numerical analysis as well as a semi-analytic study on how the compactness and
the total mass will deviate from that of the usual boson stars formed with a
quartic repulsive self-interaction. We apply the recently suggested Swampland

derive the allowed mass range of scalar particles which compose the boson star.
We further analyze applications of the lensing of fast radio bursts (FRBs) and
the gravitational wave (GW) detection to probe the presence of such boson stars

the two types of boson star potentials can be discriminated by the FRB and GW

cohomology classes on the moduli space of genus-zero Riemann surfaces with
punctures compute tree-level scattering amplitudes in quantum field theories.
The relevant cohomology classes are twisted by representations of the
fundamental group that describes how punctures braid around each other on the
Riemann surface, which can be used to link it to the space of kinematic
invariants. Intersection numbers of said cohomology classes, whose
representatives we call twisted forms, can be shown to fully localize on the
boundaries of the moduli space, which are in one-to-one map with Feynman
diagrams. We prove that when twisted forms are logarithmic, their intersection
numbers have a simple expansion in terms of trivalent Feynman diagrams allowing
only for massless propagators on the internal and external lines. For physical
applications one also needs to study non-logarithmic forms as they are
responsible for propagation of massive states. We utilize the natural fibre
bundle structure of the moduli space, which allows for a direct access to the
boundaries, to introduce recursion relations for intersection numbers that
""integrate out"" puncture-by-puncture. The resulting recursion involves only
linear algebra of certain matrices describing braiding properties of the moduli
space and evaluating one-dimensional residues, thus paving a way for explicit
analytic computations of scattering amplitudes. Together with the previous
reformulation of the tree-level S-matrix of string theory in terms of twisted
forms, the results of this work complete a unified geometric framework for
studying scattering amplitudes from genus-zero Riemann surfaces. We show that a
web of dualities between different homology and cohomology groups allows for
deriving a host of identities among various types of amplitudes computed from
the moduli space.

model, built on this scenario, introduced the concept of fraction of frictional
contacts $f$ as the relevant order parameter for the shear thickening
transition. Central to the model is the ""equation-of-state"" relating $f$ to the
applied stress $\sigma$, which is directly linked to the distribution of the
normal components of non-hydrodynamics interparticle forces. Here, we develop a
model for this force distribution, based on the so-called $q$-model that we
borrow from granular physics. This model explains the known $f(\sigma)$ in the
simple case of sphere contacts displaying only sliding friction, but also
predicts strong deviation from this ""usual"" form when stronger kinds of
constraints are applied on relative motion. We verify these predictions in the
case of contacts with rolling friction, in particular a broadening of the
stress range over which shear thickening occurs. We finally discuss how a
similar approach can be followed to predict $f(\sigma)$ in systems with other
variations from the canonical system of monodisperse spheres with sliding
friction, in particular the case of large bidispersity.

The concentration of dissolved curcumin in NADES was measured. Simulated

curcumin solubility enhancement in NADES. Results NADES comprising choline
chloride and glycerol had the highest potential for curcumin dissolution. This
system was also successfully applied as an extraction medium for obtaining
curcuminoids from natural sources, as well as an effective stabilizer
preventing curcumin degradation from sunlight. The solubility of curcumin in
simulated gastrointestinal fluids revealed that the significant increase of
bioavailability takes place in the small intestinal fluid. Conclusions
Suspension of curcumin in NADES offers beneficial properties of this new liquid
drug formulation starting from excreting from natural sources, through safe
storage and ending on the final administration route. Therefore, there is a
possibility of using a one-step process with this medium. The performed quantum
chemistry computations clearly indicated the origin of the enhanced solubility
of curcumin in NADES in the presence of intestinal fluids. Direct
intermolecular contacts leading to hetero-molecular pairs with choline chloride

Choline chloride plays a dominant role in the system and the complexes formed

long-standing goal of machine learning: the former has the ability to
generalize with small training data, while the latter provides a principled
framework for dealing with noisy data. However, existing methods for combining
the best of both worlds are typically computationally intensive. In this paper,
we focus on Markov Logic Networks and explore the use of graph neural networks
(GNNs) for representing probabilistic logic inference. It is revealed from our
analysis that the representation power of GNN alone is not enough for such a
task. We instead propose a more expressive variant, called ExpressGNN, which
can perform effective probabilistic logic inference while being able to scale
to a large number of entities. We demonstrate by several benchmark datasets
that ExpressGNN has the potential to advance probabilistic logic reasoning to
the next stage.

which aim to improve the robustness over audio-only models in the presence of
noise. However, almost all of them ignore the impact of the Lombard effect,
i.e., the change in speaking style in noisy environments which aims to make
speech more intelligible and affects both the acoustic characteristics of
speech and the lip movements. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the
Lombard effect in audio-visual speech recognition. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work which does so using end-to-end deep
architectures and presents results on unseen speakers. Our results show that
properly modelling Lombard speech is always beneficial. Even if a relatively
small amount of Lombard speech is added to the training set then the
performance in a real scenario, where noisy Lombard speech is present, can be
significantly improved. We also show that the standard approach followed in the
literature, where a model is trained and tested on noisy plain speech, provides
a correct estimate of the video-only performance and slightly underestimates
the audio-visual performance. In case of audio-only approaches, performance is
overestimated for SNRs higher than -3dB and underestimated for lower SNRs.

for mosaic command and control that enables the secure and resilient
multi-domain operations. Under the mosaic design, pieces or agents in the
network are equipped with flexible interoperability and the capability of
self-adaptability, self-healing, and resiliency so that they can reconfigure
their responses to achieve the global mission in spite of failures of nodes and
links in the adversarial environment. The proposed games-in-games approach
provides a system-of-systems science for mosaic distributed design of
large-scale systems. Specifically, the framework integrates three layers of
design for each agent including strategic layer, tactical layer, and mission
layer. Each layer in the established model corresponds to a game of a different
scale that enables the integration of threat models and achieve self-mitigation
and resilience capabilities. The solution concept of the developed multi-layer
multi-scale mosaic design is characterized by Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE)
which considers the interactions between agents across different layers. The
developed approach is applicable to modern battlefield networks which are
composed of heterogeneous assets that access highly diverse and dynamic
information sources over multiple domains. By leveraging mosaic design
principles, we can achieve the desired operational goals of deployed networks
in a case study and ensure connectivity among entities for the exchange of
information to accomplish the mission.

two stages. First, we fit models for the expected outcome and the probability

models into a downstream estimator of the effect. Neural networks are a natural
choice for the models in the first step. The question we address is: how can we
adapt the design and training of the neural networks used in the first step in
order to improve the quality of the final estimate of the treatment effect? We
propose two adaptations based on insights from the statistical literature on
the estimation of treatment effects. The first is a new architecture, the
Dragonnet, that exploits the sufficiency of the propensity score for estimation
adjustment. The second is a regularization procedure, targeted regularization,
that induces a bias towards models that have non-parametrically optimal
asymptotic properties `out-of-the-box`. Studies on benchmark datasets for
causal inference show these adaptations outperform existing methods. Code is

renormalized particle-hole random-phase approximation for a given
multipolarity. The numerical calculations are carried out for several light,

using an effective MSk3 interaction. To study the pygmy dipole resonance (PDR),
the calculations are also performed for the two light and neutron-rich

show that the inclusion of ground-state correlations beyond the random-phase

affects the RPA solutions within the whole mass range, although this effect
decreases with increasing the mass number. At the same time, the anti-pairing
effect is observed via a significant reduction of pairing in neutron-rich

remains close to the empirical distribution induced by the given dataset. Our
approach leverages the principle of maximum entropy - amongst all distributions

KL-divergence to a given prior. While maximum entropy distributions can
succinctly encode distributions over large domains, they can be difficult to
compute. Our main contribution is an instantiation of this framework for our
set of constraints and priors, which encode our bias mitigation goals, and that
runs in time polynomial in the dimension of the data. Empirically, we observe
that samples from the learned distribution have desired representation rates

elongation of the shells increase with the stellar wind anisotropy. In our

novel topological phases hosting symmetry-protected electronic excitations and
exotic magnetic ground states. However, the paradigmatic states of the
idealized two-dimensional (2D) kagome lattice - Dirac fermions and topological
flat bands - have not been simultaneously observed, partly owing to the complex
stacking structure of the kagome compounds studied to date. Here, we take the
approach of examining FeSn, an antiferromagnetic single-layer kagome metal with
spatially-decoupled kagome planes. Using polarization- and
termination-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we
detect the momentum-space signatures of coexisting flat bands and Dirac
fermions in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. Intriguingly, when complemented
with bulk-sensitive de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) measurements, our data reveal an
even richer electronic structure that exhibits robust surface Dirac fermions on
specific crystalline terminations. Through band structure calculations and
matrix element simulations, we demonstrate that the bulk Dirac bands arise from
in-plane localized Fe-3d orbitals under kagome symmetry, while the surface
state realizes a rare example of fully spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions when
combined with spin-layer locking in FeSn. These results highlight FeSn as a
prototypical host for the emergent excitations of the kagome lattice. The
prospect to harness these excitations for novel topological phases and
spintronic devices is a frontier of great promise at the confluence of

  Hybrid Frequency-Selective mmWave MIMO Systems",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The large beamforming gain used to operate at millimeter wave (mmWave)
frequencies requires obtaining channel information to configure hybrid antenna
arrays. Previously proposed wideband channel estimation strategies, however,
assume perfect time-frequency synchronization and neglect phase noise, making
these approaches impractical. Consequently, achieving time-frequency
synchronization between transmitter and receiver and correcting for phase noise
(PN) as the channel is estimated, is the greatest challenge yet to be solved in
order to configure hybrid precoders and combiners in practical settings. In
this paper, building upon our prior work, we find the Maximum A Posteriori
(MAP) solution to the joint problem of timing offset (TO), carrier frequency
offset (CFO), PN and compressive channel estimation for broadband mmWave MIMO
systems with hybrid architectures. Simulation results show that, using
significantly less training symbols than in the beam training protocol in the
5G New Radio communications standard, joint synchronization and channel
estimation at the low SNR regime can be achieved, and near-optimum data rates
can be attained.

fundamental problem in supervised learning. This paper presents a framework for
estimating dependence between numerical features and a categorical label using
generalized Gini distance, an energy distance in reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces (RKHS). Two Gini distance based dependence measures are explored: Gini
distance covariance and Gini distance correlation. Unlike Pearson covariance
and correlation, which do not characterize independence, the above Gini
distance based measures define dependence as well as independence of random
variables. The test statistics are simple to calculate and do not require
probability density estimation. Uniform convergence bounds and asymptotic
bounds are derived for the test statistics. Comparisons with distance
covariance statistics are provided. It is shown that Gini distance statistics
converge faster than distance covariance statistics in the uniform convergence
bounds, hence tighter upper bounds on both Type I and Type II errors. Moreover,
the probability of Gini distance covariance statistic under-performing the
distance covariance statistic in Type II error decreases to 0 exponentially
with the increase of the sample size. Extensive experimental results are
presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

theoretical challenge to galaxy surveys which infer the large-scale structure
with Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs). Guided by RT simulations, prior studies
investigated the impact of RT on the large-scale LAE clustering, and claimed
that RT induces a selection effect which results in an anisotropic distortion
even in real space but in an otherwise negligible effect in redshift space.
However, our previous study, which relies on a full radiative transfer code run
on the Illustris simulations, shows that the anisotropic selection effect was
drastically reduced with higher spatial resolution. Adopting the same
simulation framework, we further study the impact of RT on the LAE clustering
in redshift space. Since we measure LAE's radial position through a spectral
peak of a Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, the frequency shift due to RT contaminates
the redshift measurement and hence the inferred radial position in redshift
space. We demonstrate that this additional RT offset suppresses the LAE
clustering along the line of sight, which can be interpreted as a novel
Fingers-of-God (FoG) effect. To assess the FoG effect, we develop a theoretical
framework with particular emphasis on its connection with the underlying
one-point velocity distribution which simultaneously takes into account the RT
offset as well as the peculiar velocity that is commonly studied in the context
of the Redshift Space Distortion (RSD). Although our findings strongly
encourage a more careful RSD modeling in LAE surveys, we also seek a method to
mitigate the additional FoG effect due to RT by making use of other information
in a Lyman-$\alpha$ spectrum.

direct detection constraints. We resolve this tension using a simple class of
models, where dark matter is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, having naturally
momentum-suppressed couplings to nuclei. Exploring the parameter space of the

compatible with constraints from the relic abundance and annihilation in dwarf
spheroidal galaxies. In certain regions of parameter space, the Higgs-dark
matter coupling can help stabilize the Higgs potential up to the Planck scale.
The scalar partner of the dark matter is an extra Higgs boson, that can explain
a tentative diphoton excess observed by CMS, and an excess of $b\bar b$ signal
from LEP, if its mass is $\sim 96$\,GeV and the model is extended to include a

with long short-term memory architectures to simultaneously generate sentences

(i.e. 1$\sigma$ mid-transit time uncertainties greater than 30 minutes) one
year after their TESS observations. We verify these results using a sample of
TESS planet candidates as well. In particular, of the simulated planets that
would be recommended as JWST targets by Kempton et al. (2018), $\sim$80% will
have mid-transit time uncertainties $>$ 30 minutes by the earliest time JWST
would observe them. This rapid deterioration is driven primarily by the
relatively short time baseline of TESS observations. We describe strategies for
maintaining TESS ephemerides fresh through follow-up transit observations. We
find that the longer the baseline between the TESS and the follow-up
observations, the longer the ephemerides stay fresh, and that 51% of simulated
primary mission TESS planets will require space-based observations. The
recently-approved extension to the TESS mission will rescue the ephemerides of
most (though not all) primary mission planets, but the benefits of these new
observations can only be reaped two years after the primary mission
observations. Moreover, the ephemerides of most primary mission TESS planets
(as well as those newly discovered during the extended mission) will again have
expired by the time future facilities such as the ELTs, Ariel and the possible
LUVOIR/OST missions come online, unless maintenance follow-up observations are

flavor, coupled to the SM via effective operators suppressed by the mass $M$ of
new electroweak-charged particles. This effective field theory is inspired by a
new tripled top model of supersymmetric neutral naturalness. The hidden sector
is accessed primarily via the $Z$ and Higgs portals, which also mediate the
decays of the hidden mesons back to SM particles. We find that exotic $Z$
decays at the LHC and future $Z$ factories provide the strongest sensitivity to

dominantly produce final states with two hidden mesons. ATLAS and CMS can probe
their prompt decays up to $M\sim 3\;\mathrm{TeV}$ at the high luminosity phase,

Bayesian SED model to simultaneously fit its synchrotron, interstellar and
supernova dust emission. We infer an interstellar dust extinction map with an
average $A_{\text{V}}$=1.08$\pm$0.38 mag, consistent with a small contribution
(<22%) to the Crab's overall infrared emission. The Crab's supernova dust mass
is estimated to be between 0.032 and 0.049 M$_{\odot}$ (for amorphous carbon
grains) with an average dust temperature $T_{\text{dust}}$=41$\pm$3K,
corresponding to a dust condensation efficiency of 8-12%. This revised dust
mass is up to an order of magnitude lower than some previous estimates, which
can be attributed to our different interstellar dust corrections, lower SPIRE
flux densities, and higher dust temperature than were used in previous studies.
The dust within the Crab is predominantly found in dense filaments south of the
pulsar, with an average V-band dust extinction of $A_{\text{V}}$=0.20-0.39 mag,
consistent with recent optical dust extinction studies. The modelled
synchrotron power-law spectrum is consistent with a radio spectral index
$\alpha_{\text{radio}}$=0.297$\pm$0.009 and an infrared spectral index
$\alpha_{\text{IR}}$=0.429$\pm$0.021. We have identified a millimetre excess
emission in the Crab's central regions, and argue that it most likely results
from two distinct populations of synchrotron emitting particles. We conclude
that the Crab's efficient dust condensation (8-12%) provides further evidence
for a scenario where supernovae can provide substantial contributions to the
interstellar dust budgets in galaxies.

emitters have attracted significant interest recently. For example, the strong
constructive or destructive interference of emitted light enables arrays to
function as nearly perfect mirrors, support topological edge states, and allow
for exponentially better quantum memories. In these proposals, the assumed
atomic structure was simple, consisting of a unique electronic ground state.
Within linear optics, the system is then equivalent to a periodic array of
classical dielectric particles, whose periodicity supports the emergence of
guided modes. However, it has not been known whether such phenomena persist in
the presence of hyperfine structure, as exhibited by most quantum emitters.
Here, we show that waveguiding can arise from rich atomic entanglement as a
quantum many-body effect, and elucidate the necessary conditions. Our work
represents a significant step forward in understanding collective effects in
arrays of atoms with realistic electronic structure.

early-type galaxies (ETGs) from the CALIFA integral field spectroscopic survey,
including 48 ellipticals and 21 S0's. We generate and quantitatively
characterize profiles of light-weighted mean stellar age and metallicity within
$\lesssim 2R_e$, as a function of radius and stellar-mass surface density
$\mu_*$. We study in detail the dependence of profiles on galaxies' global
properties, including velocity dispersion $\sigma_e$, stellar mass, morphology.
ETGs are universally characterized by strong, negative metallicity gradients
($\sim -0.3\,\text{dex}$ per $R_e$) within $1\,R_e$, which flatten out moving
towards larger radii. A quasi-universal local $\mu_*$-metallicity relation
emerges, which displays a residual systematic dependence on $\sigma_e$, whereby
higher $\sigma_e$ implies higher metallicity at fixed $\mu_*$. Age profiles are
typically U-shaped, with minimum around $0.4\,R_e$, asymptotic increase to
maximum ages beyond $\sim 1.5\,R_e$, and an increase towards the centre. The
depth of the minimum and the central increase anti-correlate with $\sigma_e$. A
possible qualitative interpretation of these observations is a two-phase
scenario. In the first phase, dissipative collapse occurs in the inner
$1\,R_e$, establishing a negative metallicity gradient. The competition between
the outside-in quenching due to feedback-driven winds and some form of
inside-out quenching, possibly caused by central AGN feedback or dynamical
heating, determines the U-shaped age profiles. In the second phase, the
accretion of ex-situ stars from quenched and low-metallicity satellites shapes
the flatter stellar population profiles in the outer regions.

strict tests of competing models of the Milky Way. Previous estimates, based on
samples of up to a few hundred events, gave larger values than expected from
the Galactic models and were difficult to reconcile with other constraints on
the Galactic structure. Here we used long-term photometric observations of the
Galactic bulge by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) to select
a homogeneous sample of 8000 gravitational microlensing events. We created the
largest and most accurate microlensing optical depth and event rate maps of the
Galactic bulge. The new maps ease the tension between the previous measurements
and Galactic models. They are consistent with some earlier calculations based
on bright stars and are systematically ~30% smaller than the other estimates
based on ""all-source"" samples of microlensing events. The difference is caused
by the careful estimation of the source star population. The new maps agree
well with predictions based on the Besancon model of the Galaxy. Apart from
testing the Milky Way models, our maps may have numerous other applications,
such as the measurement of the initial mass function or constraining the dark
matter content in the Milky Way center. The new maps will also inform the
planning of future space-based microlensing experiments by revising the

the metric integral is lower bounded by the topological $C_{2z}T$ Wilson loop

a topological lower bound proportional to the pairing gap. In contrast, trivial
flat bands have a zero superfluid weight. The superfluid weight is crucial in

extremely hard to compute realistic observables. A key discriminator of a
cosmological constant, however, is that the growth of structure is

construct a null test which vanishes for any model of gravity or dark energy

the exact environment full update (eeFU), introduced in Phys. Rev. B 99, 035115
(2019), which represents the purification of a thermal density matrix on an
infinite hexagonal lattice by an infinite projected entangled pair state
(iPEPS). We show that thanks to a dynamical mapping from a hexagonal to a
rhombic lattice, the eeFU on the hexagonal lattice is as efficient as the
simple full update (FU) algorithm. Critical temperatures for coupling constants
in the stripy and the antiferromagnetic phase are estimated. They are an order
of magnitude less than the couplings in the Hamiltonian. By a duality
transformation, these results can be mapped to, respectively, the ferromagnetic
and zigzag phases. For the special case of the pure Kitaev model, which is
tractable by quantum Monte-Carlo but the most challenging for tensor networks,
the algorithm is benchmarked against the Monte-Carlo results. It recovers
accurately the crossover to spin ordering and qualitatively the one to flux
ordering.

Moreover, the calculations show that, while the entanglement entropy decreases

suited for probing its atmospheric composition and structure. However, due to
instrument pointing motion, only five out of tens of observations have been
analyzed. We present an innovative retrieval method that corrects for the
effect of pointing motion by forward modeling the Cassini/UVIS instrument
response function with the pointing motion value obtained from the SPICE
C-kernel along the spectral dimension. To illustrate the methodology, an
occultation observation made during flyby T52 is analyzed, when the Cassini
spacecraft had insufficient attitude control. A high-resolution stellar model
and an instrument response simulator that includes the position of the point
source on the detector are used for the analysis of the pointing motion. The
Markov Chain Monte-Carlo method is used to retrieve the line-of-sight abundance
profiles of eleven species (CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C4H2, C6H6, HCN, C2N2, HC3N,
C6N2 and haze particles) in the spectral vector fitting process. We obtain
tight constraints on all of the species aside from C2H6, C2N2 and C6N2, for
which we only retrieved upper limits. This is the first time that the T52
occultation was used to derive abundances of major hydrocarbon and nitrile
species in Titan's upper and middle atmosphere, as pointing motion prohibited
prior analysis. With this new method, nearly all of the occultations obtained
over the entire Cassini mission could yield reliable profiles of atmospheric
composition, allowing exploration of Titan's upper atmosphere over seasons,
latitudes, and longitudes.

and computational determination of impurity levels makes a data-driven machine
learning approach appropriate. In this work, we show that a density functional
theory-generated dataset of impurities in Cd-based chalcogenides CdTe, CdSe,
and CdS can lead to accurate and generalizable predictive models of defect
properties. By converting any semiconductor + impurity system into a set of
numerical descriptors, regression models are developed for the impurity
formation enthalpy and charge transition levels. These regression models can
subsequently predict impurity properties in mixed anion CdX compounds (where X
is a combination of Te, Se and S) fairly accurately, proving that although
trained only on the end points, they are applicable to intermediate
compositions. We make machine-learned predictions of the Fermi-level dependent
formation energies of hundreds of possible impurities in 5 chalcogenide
compounds, and suggest a list of impurities which can shift the equilibrium
Fermi level in the semiconductor as determined by the dominant intrinsic
defects. These dominating impurities as predicted by machine learning compare
well with DFT predictions, revealing the power of machine-learned models in the
quick screening of impurities likely to affect the optoelectronic behavior of
semiconductors.

data association) and for evaluating the information-theoretic term for
different candidate actions in belief space planning (BSP). In this paper we
make two primary contributions. First, we develop a novel general-purpose
incremental covariance update technique, which efficiently recovers specific
covariance entries after any change in the inference problem, such as
introduction of new observations/variables or re-linearization of the state
vector. Our approach is shown to recover them faster than other
state-of-the-art methods. Second, we present a computationally efficient
approach for BSP in high-dimensional state spaces, leveraging our incremental
covariance update method. State of the art BSP approaches perform belief
propagation for each candidate action and then evaluate an objective function
that typically includes an information-theoretic term, such as entropy or
information gain. Yet, candidate actions often have similar parts (e.g. common
trajectory parts), which are however evaluated separately for each candidate.
Moreover, calculating the information-theoretic term involves a costly
determinant computation of the entire information (covariance) matrix which is
O(n^3) with n being dimension of the state or costly Schur complement
operations if only marginal posterior covariance of certain variables is of
interest. Our approach, rAMDL-Tree, extends our previous BSP method rAMDL, by
exploiting incremental covariance calculation and performing calculation re-use
between common parts of non-myopic candidate actions, such that these parts are
evaluated only once, in contrast to existing approaches.

brain activity using Electroencephalogram (EEG) or Magnetoencephalography (MEG)
recordings. Traditional EEG/MEG Source Imaging (ESI) methods usually assume
that either source activity at different time points is unrelated, or that
similar spatiotemporal patterns exist across an entire study period. The former
assumption makes ESI analyses sensitive to noise, while the latter renders ESI
analyses unable to account for time-varying patterns of activity. To
effectively deal with noise while maintaining flexibility and continuity among
brain activation patterns, we propose a novel probabilistic ESI model based on
a hierarchical graph prior. Under our method, a spanning tree constraint
ensures that activity patterns have spatiotemporal continuity. An efficient
algorithm based on alternating convex search is presented to solve the proposed
model and is provably convergent. Comprehensive numerical studies using
synthetic data on a real brain model are conducted under different levels of
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from both sensor and source spaces. We also examine
the EEG/MEG data in a real application, in which our ESI reconstructions are
neurologically plausible. All the results demonstrate significant improvements
of the proposed algorithm over the benchmark methods in terms of source
localization performance, especially at high noise levels.

for probing quantum and classical systems. Examples include the amplification
of small signals, investigating quantum paradoxes, and elucidating fundamental
quantum phenomena such as geometric phase. A key characteristic of the weak
value is that it can be complex, in contrast to a standard expectation value.
However, typically only either the real or imaginary component of the weak
value is determined in a given experimental setup. Weak measurements can be
used to, in a sense, simultaneously measure non-commuting observables. This
principle was used in the direct measurement of the quantum wavefunction.
However, the wavefunction's real and imaginary components, given by a weak
value, are determined in different setups or on separate ensembles of systems,
putting the procedure's directness in question. To address these issues, we
introduce and experimentally demonstrate a general method to simultaneously
read out both components of the weak value in a single experimental apparatus.
In particular, we directly measure the polarization state of an ensemble of
photons using weak measurement. With our method, each photon contributes to
both the real and imaginary parts of the weak-value average. On a fundamental
level, this suggests that the full complex weak value is a characteristic of
each photon measured.

reduce the effect of outliers by using the Box-Cox transformation of the

astrophysical modeling, with small variations in reaction rates having a large
impact on nucleosynthesis yields. Due to the lack of experimental data at
astrophysical energies, extrapolation and microscopic methods are needed to
model fusion probabilities.
  Purpose: To investigate deep sub-barrier $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C fusion cross
sections and establish trends for the $S$ factor.
  Method: Microscopic methods based on static Hartree-Fock (HF) and
time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) mean-field theory are used to obtain
$^{12}$C+$^{12}$C ion-ion fusion potentials. Fusion cross sections and
astrophysical $S$ factors are then calculated using the incoming wave boundary
condition (IWBC) method.
  Results: Both density-constrained frozen Hartree-Fock (DCFHF) and
density-constrained TDHF (DC-TDHF) predict a rising $S$ factor at low energies,
with DC-TDHF predicting a slight damping in the deep sub-barrier region
($\approx1$~MeV). Comparison between DC-TDHF calculations and maximum
experimental cross-sections in the resonance peaks are good. However the
discrepancy in experimental low energy results inhibits interpretation of the
trend.
  Conclusions: Using the fully microscopic DCFHF and DC-TDHF methods, no $S$
factor maximum is observed in the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C fusion reaction. In
addition, no extreme sub-barrier hindrance is predicted at low energies. The
development of a microscopic theory of fusion including resonance effects, as
well as further experiments at lower energies must be done before the deep
sub-barrier behavior of the reaction can be established.

two-stage region proposal based methods trained with centroid or bounding-box
annotations. We propose a highly accurate and efficient one-stage lesion
detector, by re-designing a RetinaNet to meet the particular challenges in
medical imaging. Specifically, we optimize the anchor configurations using a
differential evolution search algorithm. For training, we leverage the response
evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) annotation which are measured in
clinical routine. We incorporate dense masks from weak RECIST labels, obtained
automatically using GrabCut, into the training objective, which in combination
with other advancements yields new state-of-the-art performance. We evaluate
our method on the public DeepLesion benchmark, consisting of 32,735 lesions
across the body. Our one-stage detector achieves a sensitivity of 90.77% at 4
false positives per image, significantly outperforming the best reported
methods by over 5%.

several beneficial properties compared with the state-of-the-art. First, a

resonance imaging (fMRI) and electro-encephalography (EEG) have propelled a
growing interest in brain-network clustering via time-series analysis.
Notwithstanding, most of the brain-network clustering methods revolve around
state clustering and/or node clustering (a.k.a. community detection or topology
inference) within states. This work answers first the need of capturing
non-linear nodal dependencies by bringing forth a novel feature-extraction
mechanism via kernel autoregressive-moving-average modeling. The extracted
features are mapped to the Grassmann manifold (Grassmannian), which consists of
all linear subspaces of a fixed rank. By virtue of the Riemannian geometry of
the Grassmannian, a unifying clustering framework is offered to tackle all
possible clustering problems in a network: Cluster multiple states, detect
communities within states, and even identify/track subnetwork state sequences.
The effectiveness of the proposed approach is underlined by extensive numerical
tests on synthetic and real fMRI/EEG data which demonstrate that the advocated
learning method compares favorably versus several state-of-the-art clustering
schemes.

unexplored field of many-body physics. Certain fracton states' similarity to
gravity is an intriguing property. In an earlier work [H. Yan, Phys. Rev. B 99,
155126 (2019)], we have demonstrated that a simple fracton model in anti-de
Sitter space satisfies several major holographic properties. In this follow-up
paper, we study the eight-vertex model dual to the original model. The dual
model has the advantage of illuminating the mutual information and subsystem
charges pictorially, which helps to reveal its connections to various other
topics in the study of holography and fracton phases. At zero temperature, the
dual eight-vertex model is a discrete realization of the bit-thread model, a
powerful tool developed to visualize holography. The bit-thread picture
combined with subsystem charges can give a quantitative account of the isometry
between the bulk and the boundary at finite energy, which is also a key issue
for holography. The black hole microscopic degrees of freedom can be identified
in this picture, which turn out to be encoded non-locally on the horizon. The
eight-vertex model proves to be a very helpful venue to improve our
understanding of the hyperbolic fracton model as a toy model of holography.

QMC methods are faced with a sign problem, causing the severe limitation of an
exponential increase in the sampling complexity and hence the run-time of the

framework introduces measures of non-stoquasticity that -- as we demonstrate

optimization over the orthogonal group and ease the sign problem of frustrated
Heisenberg ladders. Complementing this pragmatic mindset, we prove that easing
the sign problem in terms of those measures is in general an NP-complete task
for nearest-neighbour Hamiltonians and simple basis choices by a polynomial
reduction to the MAXCUT-problem. Intriguingly, easing remains hard even in
cases in which we can efficiently assert that no exact solution exists.

contributions of the moving targets from those due to stationary background
reflectors. Both components of the data, that is, reflections from stationary
and moving targets, are considered as signal that is needed for target imaging
and tracking, respectively. The approach we use is to decompose the data matrix
into a low rank and a sparse part. This decomposition enables us to capture the
reflections from moving targets into the sparse part and those from stationary
targets into the low rank part of the data. The computational tool for this is
robust principal component analysis (RPCA) applied to the SAR data matrix. We
also introduce a lossless baseband transformation of the data, which simplifies
the analysis and improves the performance of the RPCA algorithm. Our main
contribution is a theoretical analysis that determines an optimal choice of
parameters for the RPCA algorithm so as to have an effective and stable
separation of SAR data coming from moving and stationary targets. This analysis
gives also a lower bound for detectable target velocities. We show in
particular that the rank of the sparse matrix is proportional to the square
root of the target's speed in the direction that connects the SAR platform
trajectory to the imaging region. The robustness of the approach is illustrated

and a magnetic field with a null point. All simulations have the same magnetic
field configuration but different transition region heights. Compressive wave
packets introduced in the photospheric portion of the simulations refract
towards the null and collapse it into a current sheet, which then undergoes
reconnection. The collapsed null forms a current sheet due to a strong magnetic
pressure gradient caused by the inability of magnetic perturbations to cross
the null. Although the null current sheet undergoes multiple reconnection
episodes due to repeated reflections off the lower boundary, we find no
evidence of oscillatory reconnection arising from the dynamics of the null
itself. Wave mode conversion around the null generates a series of slow mode
shocks localized near each separatrix. The shock strength is asymmetric across
each separatrix, and subsequent shock damping therefore creates a tangential
discontinuity across each separatrix, with long--lived current densities. A
parameter study of the injected wave energy to reach the null confirms our
previous WKB estimates. Finally, using current estimates of the photospheric
acoustic power, we estimate that the shock and Ohmic heating we describe may
account for $\approx1-10\%$ of the radiative losses from coronal bright points
with similar topologies, and are similarly insufficient to account for losses
from larger structures such as ephemeral regions. At the same time, the
dynamics are comparable to proposed mechanisms for generating type--II

authority allocated to the human partner to improve their sense of agency,
while improving safety. We evaluate the efficacy of our shared control
algorithm with a human subjects study (n=20) conducted in two simulated

free to operate each system however they would like (i.e., there is no

to consider more than 10,000 potential trajectories at each time step in a

success of deep learning in grid-structured data, graph neural network models
have been proposed to learn powerful node-level or graph-level representation.
However, most of the existing graph neural networks suffer from the following
limitations: (1) there is limited analysis regarding the graph convolution
properties, such as seed-oriented, degree-aware and order-free; (2) the node's
degree-specific graph structure is not explicitly expressed in graph
convolution for distinguishing structure-aware node neighborhoods; (3) the
theoretical explanation regarding the graph-level pooling schemes is unclear.
  To address these problems, we propose a generic degree-specific graph neural
network named DEMO-Net motivated by Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test
that recursively identifies 1-hop neighborhood structures. In order to
explicitly capture the graph topology integrated with node attributes, we argue
that graph convolution should have three properties: seed-oriented,
degree-aware, order-free. To this end, we propose multi-task graph convolution
where each task represents node representation learning for nodes with a
specific degree value, thus leading to preserving the degree-specific graph
structure. In particular, we design two multi-task learning methods:
degree-specific weight and hashing functions for graph convolution. In
addition, we propose a novel graph-level pooling/readout scheme for learning
graph representation provably lying in a degree-specific Hilbert kernel space.
The experimental results on several node and graph classification benchmark
data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed DEMO-Net

designed assuming availability of SNP-level information. However, modern
genetic and sequencing data present new challenges to access and sharing of
genotype-phenotype datasets, including cost management, difficulties in
consolidation of records across research groups, etc. These issues make methods
based on SNP-level summary statistics for a joint analysis of variants in a
group particularly appealing. The most common form of combining statistics is a
sum of SNP-level squared scores, possibly weighted, as in burden tests for rare
variants. The overall significance of the resulting statistic is evaluated
using its distribution under the null hypothesis. Here, we demonstrate that
this basic approach can be substantially improved by decorrelating scores prior
to their addition, resulting in remarkable power gains in situations that are
most commonly encountered in practice; namely, under heterogeneity of effect
sizes and diversity between pairwise LD. In these situations, the power of the
traditional test, based on the added squared scores, quickly reaches a ceiling,
as the number of variants increases. Thus, the traditional approach does not
benefit from information potentially contained in any additional SNPs, while
our decorrelation by orthogonal transformation (DOT) method yields steady gain
in power. We present theoretical and computational analyses of both approaches,
and reveal causes behind sometimes dramatic difference in their respective
powers. We showcase DOT by analyzing breast cancer data, in which our method
strengthened levels of previously reported associations and implied the
possibility of multiple new alleles that jointly confer breast cancer risk.

regularization methods based on learned convolutional operators are emerging in
MBIR. We modify the architecture of an iterative neural network, BCD-Net, for
PET MBIR, and demonstrate the efficacy of the trained BCD-Net using XCAT
phantom data that simulates the low true coincidence count-rates with high
random fractions typical for Y-90 PET patient imaging after Y-90 microsphere
radioembolization. Numerical results show that the proposed BCD-Net
significantly improves CNR and RMSE of the reconstructed images compared to
MBIR methods using non-trained regularizers, total variation (TV) and non-local

differs from the training data. Improvements were also demonstrated for the
clinically relevant phantom measurement data where we used training and testing

the total integrated mass profiles. The mass profile shape is quantified by the
sparsity, the ratio of M500 to M2500, the masses at density contrast 500 and
2500, respectively. We study the correlations between the various parameters
and their dependence on redshift. We confirm that SZ-selected samples, thought
to reflect most closely the underlying cluster population, are dominated by
disturbed and non-cool core objects at all z. There is no significant evolution
or mass dependence of either the cool core fraction or the centroid shift
parameter. The M parameter evolves slightly with z, having a correlation
coefficient of rho= -0.2 $\pm$ 0.1 and a null hypothesis p-value of 0.01. In
the high mass regime considered here, the sparsity evolves minimally with
redshift, increasing by 10% between z<0.2 and z>0.55, an effect significant at

state is much stronger, increasing by a factor of $\sim$60% from the 1/3 most
relaxed to the 1/3 most disturbed objects, an effect significant at more than 3

spoiled by the formation of DM bound states (also due to dark-photon effects),

O(10 GeV). The mixing of the dark photon with the Z and ordinary photon is
strongly suppressed by introducing a softly-broken discrete symmetry similar to
charge conjugation, which also ensures that the dark photon life-time is short
enough to avoid restrictions derived form big-bang nucleosynthesis and
large-scale structure formation. Other constraints are accommodated without the

the assumption that objects are usually continuous and therefore nearby pixels
should be assigned the same object label. Even if it is a valid assumption in
general, these methods do not offer a straightforward way to incorporate more
complex priors like convexity or arbitrary shape restrictions. In this work we
propose Post-DAE, a post-processing method based on denoising autoencoders
(DAE) trained using only segmentation masks. We learn a low-dimensional space
of anatomically plausible segmentations, and use it as a post-processing step
to impose shape constraints on the resulting masks obtained with arbitrary
segmentation methods. Our approach is independent of image modality and
intensity information since it employs only segmentation masks for training.
This enables the use of anatomical segmentations that do not need to be paired
with intensity images, making the approach very flexible. Our experimental
results on anatomical segmentation of X-ray images show that Post-DAE can
improve the quality of noisy and incorrect segmentation masks obtained with a
variety of standard methods, by bringing them back to a feasible space, with
almost no extra computational time.

for measuring an electron s OAM. It is based on two phase elements, which are

items. A key challenge is the wide variation in the physical properties of
food, demanding diverse acquisition strategies that are also capable of
adapting to previously unseen items. Our key insight is that items with similar
physical properties will exhibit similar success rates across an action space,
allowing the robot to generalize its actions to previously unseen items. To
better understand which skewering strategy works best for each food item, we
collected a dataset of 2450 robot bite acquisition trials for 16 food items
with varying properties. Analyzing the dataset provided insights into how the
food items' surrounding environment, fork pitch, and fork roll angles affect
bite acquisition success. We then developed a bite acquisition framework that
takes the image of a full plate as an input, segments it into food items, and
then applies our Skewering-Position-Action network (SPANet) to choose a target
food item and a corresponding action so that the bite acquisition success rate
is maximized. SPANet also uses the surrounding environment features of food
items to predict action success rates. We used this framework to perform
multiple experiments on uncluttered and cluttered plates. Results indicate that
our integrated system can successfully generalize skewering strategies to many
previously unseen food items.

  Components in Quantum Circuits",,,,,"quant-ph cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Research on quantum computing has recently gained significant momentum since
first physical devices became available. Many quantum algorithms make use of
so-called oracles that implement Boolean functions and are queried with highly
superposed input states in order to evaluate the implemented Boolean function
for many different input patterns in parallel. To simplify or enable a
realization of these oracles in quantum logic in the first place, the Boolean
reversible functions to be realized usually need to be broken down into several
non-reversible sub-functions. However, since quantum logic is inherently
reversible, these sub-functions have to be realized in a reversible fashion by
adding further qubits in order to make the output patterns distinguishable (a
process that is also known as embedding). This usually results in a significant
increase of the qubits required in total. In this work, we show how this
overhead can be significantly reduced by utilizing coding. More precisely, we
prove that one additional qubit is always enough to embed any non-reversible
function into a reversible one by using a variable-length encoding of the
output patterns. Moreover, we characterize those functions that do not require
an additional qubit at all. The made observations show that coding often allows
one to undercut the usually considered minimum of additional qubits in
sub-functions of oracles by far.

carrier recombination at defects in 2D materials has not been well understood,

mechanism into key physical quantities: zero-phonon line (ZPL) and Huang-Rhys
factor. At the end, we identified strain can effectively tune the
electron-phonon coupling at defect centers and drastically change non-radiative
recombination rates. Our theoretical development serves as a general platform
for understanding carrier recombination at defects in 2D materials, while
providing pathways for engineering of quantum efficiency of SPE.

  Monitoring Invalidated Lines",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  OS-based page sharing is a commonly used optimization in modern systems to
reduce memory footprint. Unfortunately, such sharing can cause Flush+Reload
cache attacks, whereby a spy periodically flushes a cache line of shared data
(using the clflush instruction) and reloads it to infer the access patterns of
a victim application. Current proposals to mitigate Flush+Reload attacks are
impractical as they either disable page sharing, or require application
rewrite, or require OS support, or incur ISA changes. Ideally, we want to
tolerate attacks without requiring any OS or ISA support and while incurring
negligible performance and storage overheads.
  This paper makes the key observation that when a cache line is invalidated
due to a Flush-Caused Invalidation (FCI), the tag and data of the invalidated
line are still resident in the cache and can be used for detecting Flush-based
attacks. We call lines invalidated due to FCI as Zombie lines. Our design
explicitly marks such lines as Zombies, preserves the Zombie lines in the
cache, and uses the hits and misses to Zombie lines to tolerate the attacks. We
propose Zombie-Based Mitigation (ZBM), a simple hardware-based design that
successfully guards against attacks by simply treating hits on Zombie-lines as
misses to avoid any timing leaks to the attacker. We analyze the robustness of
ZBM using three spy programs: attacking AES T-Tables, attacking RSA
Square-and-Multiply, and Function Watcher (FW), and show that ZBM successfully
defends against these attacks. Our solution requires negligible storage (4-bits
per cache line), retains OS-based page sharing, requires no OS/ISA changes, and
does not incur slowdown for benign applications.

technology that may solve most of the problems associated with current
refrigerant methods. Solid-state cooling consists of applying external fields
on caloric materials, which react thermally as a result of induced phase
transformations. From an energy efficiency point of view, mechanocaloric
compounds, in which the phase transitions of interest are driven by mechanical
stresses, probably represent the most encouraging type of caloric materials.
Conventional mechanocaloric materials like shape-memory alloys already display
good cooling performances however in most cases they also present critical
mechanical fatigue and hysteresis problems that limit their applicability.
Finding new mechanocaloric materials and mechanisms able to overcome those
problems while simultaneously rendering large temperature shifts, is necessary
to further advance the field of solid-state cooling. In this article, we review
novel families of mechanocaloric materials that in recent years have been shown
to be specially promising in the aspects that conventional mechanocaloric
materials are not, and which exhibit unconventional but significant caloric
effects. We put an emphasis on elastocaloric materials, in which the targeted
cooling spans are obtained through uniaxial stresses, since from an applied
perspective these appear to be the most accomplished. Two different types of
mechanocaloric materials emerge as particularly hopeful from our analysis,
compounds that exhibit field-induced order disorder phase transitions involving
either ions or molecules (fast-ion conductors and plastic crystals), and
multiferroics in which the structural parameters are strongly coupled with
polar and/or magnetic degrees of freedom (magnetic alloys and oxide
perovskites).

high capillary numbers the invading patterns advance symmetrically through

the wettability-dependent fluid-fluid interactions with the pore structure. The

in generating longer, richer and more fine-grained sentences and paragraphs as
image descriptions. Image captioning can be translated to the task of
sequential language prediction given visual content, where the output sequence
forms natural language description with plausible grammar. However, existing
image captioning methods focus only on language policy while not visual policy,
and thus fail to capture visual context that are crucial for compositional
reasoning such as object relationships (e.g., ""man riding horse"") and visual
comparisons (e.g., ""small(er) cat""). This issue is especially severe when
generating longer sequences such as a paragraph. To fill the gap, we propose a
Context-Aware Visual Policy network (CAVP) for fine-grained image-to-language
generation: image sentence captioning and image paragraph captioning. During
captioning, CAVP explicitly considers the previous visual attentions as
context, and decides whether the context is used for the current word/sentence
generation given the current visual attention. Compared against traditional
visual attention mechanism that only fixes a single visual region at each step,
CAVP can attend to complex visual compositions over time. The whole image
captioning model -- CAVP and its subsequent language policy network -- can be
efficiently optimized end-to-end by using an actor-critic policy gradient
method. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of CAVP by state-of-the-art
performances on MS-COCO and Stanford captioning datasets, using various metrics

light in vacuum. Our associated space-time measures do not diverge at the
maximum speed of each interval of speeds and implies a generalisation of

an expression for the energy of material particles, which approaches the

non-linear estimation of convolutionally encoded sequences is discussed. First
a probability measure (denoted Q), whose Radon-Nikodym derivative with respect

constructed. It is shown that with respect to Q, the observations are mutually

or/and temporally discretization of the governing equation into the
finite-dimensional algebraic system solved by computers. Due to complicated
nature of the physics and geometry, such process can be computational
prohibitive for most real-time applications and many-query analyses. Therefore,
developing a cost-effective surrogate model is of great practical significance.
Deep learning (DL) has shown new promises for surrogate modeling due to its
capability of handling strong nonlinearity and high dimensionality. However,
the off-the-shelf DL architectures fail to operate when the data becomes
sparse. Unfortunately, data is often insufficient in most parametric fluid
dynamics problems since each data point in the parameter space requires an
expensive numerical simulation based on the first principle, e.g.,
Naiver--Stokes equations. In this paper, we provide a physics-constrained DL
approach for surrogate modeling of fluid flows without relying on any
simulation data. Specifically, a structured deep neural network (DNN)
architecture is devised to enforce the initial and boundary conditions, and the
governing partial differential equations are incorporated into the loss of the
DNN to drive the training. Numerical experiments are conducted on a number of
internal flows relevant to hemodynamics applications, and the forward
propagation of uncertainties in fluid properties and domain geometry is studied
as well. The results show excellent agreement on the flow field and
forward-propagated uncertainties between the DL surrogate approximations and
the first-principle numerical simulations.

neural network. Model parameters of all the subproblems are optimized
collaboratively according to a neighborhood-based parameter-transfer strategy
and the DRL training algorithm. Pareto optimal solutions can be directly
obtained through the trained neural network models. In specific, the
multi-objective travelling salesman problem (MOTSP) is solved in this work
using the DRL-MOA method by modelling the subproblem as a Pointer Network.
Extensive experiments have been conducted to study the DRL-MOA and various

re-training the model. The solutions can be directly obtained by a simple
forward calculation of the neural network; thereby, no iteration is required
and the MOP can be always solved in a reasonable time. The proposed method
provides a new way of solving the MOP by means of DRL. It has shown a set of

  inverse analysis",,,,,"physics.comp-ph cs.LG physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inverse problems often involve matching observational data using a physical
model that takes a large number of parameters as input. These problems tend to
be under-constrained and require regularization to impose additional structure
on the solution in parameter space. A central difficulty in regularization is
turning a complex conceptual model of this additional structure into a
functional mathematical form to be used in the inverse analysis. In this work
we propose a method of regularization involving a machine learning technique
known as a variational autoencoder (VAE). The VAE is trained to map a
low-dimensional set of latent variables with a simple structure to the
high-dimensional parameter space that has a complex structure. We train a VAE
on unconditioned realizations of the parameters for a hydrological inverse
problem. These unconditioned realizations neither rely on the observational
data used to perform the inverse analysis nor require any forward runs of the
physical model, thus making the computational cost of generating the training
data minimal. The central benefit of this approach is that regularization is
then performed on the latent variables from the VAE, which can be regularized
simply. A second benefit of this approach is that the VAE reduces the number of

  Emotional Storytelling","Accepted for the Storytelling Workshop at ACL 2019",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Centrality of emotion for the stories told by humans is underpinned by
numerous studies in literature and psychology. The research in automatic
storytelling has recently turned towards emotional storytelling, in which
characters' emotions play an important role in the plot development. However,
these studies mainly use emotion to generate propositional statements in the
form ""A feels affection towards B"" or ""A confronts B"". At the same time,
emotional behavior does not boil down to such propositional descriptions, as
humans display complex and highly variable patterns in communicating their
emotions, both verbally and non-verbally. In this paper, we analyze how
emotions are expressed non-verbally in a corpus of fan fiction short stories.
Our analysis shows that stories written by humans convey character emotions
along various non-verbal channels. We find that some non-verbal channels, such
as facial expressions and voice characteristics of the characters, are more
strongly associated with joy, while gestures and body postures are more likely
to occur with trust. Based on our analysis, we argue that automatic
storytelling systems should take variability of emotion into account when
generating descriptions of characters' emotions.

We investigate SPDT diffusion behaviours by simulating airborne disease

inefficient long-term contracts where they purchase user data without knowing
the value it provides. This paper proposes a system, Zorro, which aims to

an individual's value and population mean. The challenge remains how to
operationalize this definition, independently of a buyer's model for VoD. We

estimate click-through-rate (CTR), as an example.
  Regarding (2), Zorro empowers advertisers to measure value of user data on a
query-by-query basis and based only on the increase in accuracy it provides in
estimating CTR. In contrast advertisers currently engage in inefficient
long-term data contracts with third party data sellers. We highlight two
results on a large ad-click dataset: (i) our system has R^2=0.58, in line with

linear forms, some possibly proportional, and any $1\leq a\leq |\Sigma|$, it
has been conjectured that $I_a(\Sigma)$, the ideal generated by all $a$-fold
products of $\Sigma$, has linear graded free resolution. In this article we
show the validity of this conjecture for two cases: the first one is when
$a=d+1$ and $\Sigma$ is dual to the columns of a generating matrix of a linear
code of minimum distance $d$; and the second one is when $k=3$ and $\Sigma$
defines a line arrangement in $\mathbb P^2$ (i.e., there are no proportional
linear forms). For the second case we investigate what are the graded betti
numbers of $I_a(\Sigma)$.

existing methods solve the dictionary (and sparse representations) based on
heuristic algorithms, usually without theoretical guarantees for either
optimality or complexity. The recent $\ell^1$-minimization based methods do
provide such guarantees but the associated algorithms recover the dictionary
one column at a time. In this work, we propose a new formulation that maximizes
the $\ell^4$-norm over the orthogonal group, to learn the entire dictionary. We
prove that under a random data model, with nearly minimum sample complexity,
the global optima of the $\ell^4$ norm are very close to signed permutations of
the ground truth. Inspired by this observation, we give a conceptually simple
and yet effective algorithm based on ""matching, stretching, and projection""

and cost per iteration is merely an SVD. In addition to strong theoretical
guarantees, experiments show that the new algorithm is significantly more

Fault diagnosis is considered as an essential task in rotary machinery since
possibility of an early detection and diagnosis of the faulty condition can
save both time and money. Traditional data-driven techniques of fault diagnosis
require signal processing for feature extraction, as they are unable to work
with raw signal data, consequently leading to need for expert knowledge and
human work. The emergence of deep learning architectures in condition-based
maintenance promises to ensure high performance fault diagnosis while lowering
necessity for expert knowledge and human work. This paper presents developed

machinery. The proposed technique input raw three axis accelerometer signal as
high-definition image into deep learning layers which automatically extract

Au/NbO$_\text{x}$/Al$_\text{2}$O$_\text{3}$/Al/Nb layers and exhibits strong
analog-type resistive changes depending on the history of the charge flow. In
the extended system strong changes in the dynamics of chaotic oscillations are
observable. The otherwise fluctuating amplitudes of the Chua system are
disrupted by transient silent states. After developing a model for Chua's

underling dynamics as driven by the slow-fast dynamics of the memory element.
Furthermore, the stabilizing and destabilizing dynamic bifurcations are
identified that are passed by the system during its chaotic behavior.

have proposed a modeling framework, referred to as Evo-Lexis, that provides
insight to some fundamental questions about evolving hierarchical systems.
  The predictions of the Evo-Lexis model should be tested using real data from
evolving systems in which the outputs can be well represented by sequences. In
this paper, we investigate the time series of iGEM synthetic DNA dataset
sequences, and whether the resulting iGEM hierarchies exhibit the qualitative
properties predicted by the Evo-Lexis framework. Contrary to Evo-Lexis, in iGEM
the amount of reuse decreases during the timeline of the dataset. Although this
results in development of less cost-efficient and less deep Lexis-DAGs, the
dataset exhibits a bias in reusing specific nodes more often than others. This
results in the Lexis-DAGs to take the shape of an hourglass with relatively
high H-score values and stable set of core nodes. Despite the reuse bias and
stability of the core set, the dataset presents a high amount of diversity
among the targets which is in line with modeling of Evo-Lexis.

the other is uncharged. We find that, if we turn on a boundary source for the

condensation occurs at a certain critical value of the source, depending on the

of superconductivity at zero chemical potential, through a fluctuation analysis

problems in distributed computation. In the CONGEST-CLIQUE model, in which $n$
nodes communicate with each other over a fully connected network by exchanging
messages of $O(\log n)$ bits in synchronous rounds, the best known general
algorithm for APSP uses $\tilde O(n^{1/3})$ rounds. Breaking this barrier is a
fundamental challenge in distributed graph algorithms. In this paper we
investigate for the first time quantum distributed algorithms in the
CONGEST-CLIQUE model, where nodes can exchange messages of $O(\log n)$ quantum
bits, and show that this barrier can be broken: we construct a $\tilde
O(n^{1/4})$-round quantum distributed algorithm for the APSP over directed
graphs with polynomial weights in the CONGEST-CLIQUE model. This speedup in the
quantum setting contrasts with the case of the standard CONGEST model, for
which Elkin et al. (PODC 2014) showed that quantum communication does not offer
significant advantages over classical communication.
  Our quantum algorithm is based on a relationship discovered by Vassilevska
Williams and Williams (JACM 2018) between the APSP and the detection of
negative triangles in a graph. The quantum part of our algorithm exploits the
framework for quantum distributed search recently developed by Le Gall and
Magniez (PODC 2018). Our main technical contribution is a method showing how to
implement multiple quantum searches (one for each edge in the graph) in
parallel without introducing congestions.

in both academic research and practical applications. The high demand for
localization accuracy has been essential for safe robot planing and navigation
while it makes the current geometric solutions less robust to environmental
changes. Recent research on end-to-end methods handle raw sensory data with
forms of navigation instructions and directly output the command for robot
control. However, the lack of intermediate semantics makes the system more
rigid and unstable for practical use. To explore these issues, this paper
proposes an innovate navigation framework based on the GPS-level localization,
which takes the raw perception data with publicly accessible navigation maps to
produce an intermediate navigation cost map that allows subsequent flexible
motion planning. A deterministic conditional adversarial network is adopted in
our method to generate visual goal-directed paths under diverse navigation
conditions. The adversarial loss avoids the pixel-level annotation and enables
a weakly supervised training strategy to implicitly learn both of the traffic
semantics in image perceptions and the planning intentions in navigation
instructions. The navigation cost map is then rendered from the goal-directed
path and the concurrently collected laser data, indicating the way towards the
destination. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted with a real vehicle
running in our campus and the results have verified the robustness to
localization error of the proposed navigation system.

absorption lines from disk winds, whose launching mechanism is still in debate.
The lines are predominantly observed in the high/soft state and disappear in
the low/hard state, anti-correlated with the jet. We have tested if the thermal
winds, which are driven by the irradiation of the outer disk by the X-rays from
the inner disk, can explain these observed properties or whether we need a
magnetic switch between jet and wind. We use analytic thermal-radiative wind
models to predict the column density, ionisation parameter and velocity of the
wind given the broadband continuum shape and luminosity determined from RXTE
monitoring. We use these to simulate the detailed photo-ionised absorption
features predicted at epochs where there are Chandra high resolution spectra.
These include low/hard, high/soft and very high states. The model was found to
well reproduce the observed lines in the high/soft state, and also successfully
predicts their disappearance in the low/hard state. However, the simplest
version of the thermal wind model also predicts that there should be strong
features observed in the very high state, which are not seen in the data.
Nonetheless, we show this is consistent with thermal winds when we include
self-shielding by the irradiated inner disk atmosphere. These results indicate
that the evolution of observed wind properties in different states during
outbursts in H 1743-322 can be explained by the thermal wind model and does not

discriminative deep learning models such as image classification, object

obtained through the manual design of architectures in the fields, NAS is
usually considered as a supplement approach. In this paper, we have
significantly expanded the application areas of NAS by performing an empirical
study of NAS to search generative models, or specifically, auto-encoder based
universal style transfer, which lacks systematic exploration, if any, from the
architecture search aspect. In our work, we first designed a search space where
common operators for image style transfer such as VGG-based encoders, whitening
and coloring transforms (WCT), convolution kernels, instance normalization
operators, and skip connections were searched in a combinatorial approach. With
a simple yet effective parallel evolutionary NAS algorithm with multiple
objectives, we derived the first group of end-to-end deep networks for
universal photorealistic style transfer. Comparing to random search, a NAS
method that is gaining popularity recently, we demonstrated that carefully
designed search strategy leads to much better architecture design. Finally
compared to existing universal style transfer networks for photorealistic
rendering such as PhotoWCT that stacks multiple well-trained auto-encoders and
WCT transforms in a non-end-to-end manner, the architectures designed by
StyleNAS produce better style-transferred images with details preserving, using
a tiny number of operators/parameters, and enjoying around 500x inference time
speed-up.

confronted difficulties in accurately predicting their electronic band
structures. Here we study CuX and AgX with many-body perturbation theory in the
$GW$ approximation, implemented in the full-potential linearized augmented
plane waves (FP-LAPW) framework. Comparing the quasi-particle band structures
calculated with the default LAPW basis and the one extended by high-energy
local orbitals (HLOs), denoted as LAPW+HLOs, we find that it is crucial to
include HLOs to achieve sufficient numerical accuracy in $GW$ calculations of
these materials. Using LAPW+HLOs in semi-local density functional approximation
based $GW_0$ calculations leads to good agreement between theory and experiment
for both band gaps and the splitting between metal (Cu or Ag) $d$ and X-$p$
states. It is indicated that quasi-particle band structures of CuX and AgX are
crucially influenced by the numerical accuracy of $GW$ implementations, similar
to what was found in ZnO [Jiang, H.; Blaha, P. Phys. Rev. B 2016, 93, 115203].

interest for LED, photodetector, and solar cell applications due to their

devices exhibit slow time-scale response, which have been explained by point
defect migration5-6. In this work, we report the discovery of a room
temperature intrinsic amplification process in methylammonium lead iodide
perovskite (MAPbI3) that can be triggered by few photons, down to a single
photon. The electrical properties of the material, by way of photoresponse, are
modified by an input energy as small as 0.19 attojoules, the energy of a single
photon. These observations cannot be explained by photo-excited electronic
band-to-band transitions or prevailing model of photo-excited point defect
migration since none of the above can explain the observed macroscopic property
change by absorption of single or few photons. The results suggest the
existence of an avalanche-like collective motion of iodides and their
accumulation near the anode, which we will call ionic impact ionization (I3
mechanism). The proposed I3 process is the ionic analog of the electronic
impact ionization, and has been considered impossible before because
conventionally it takes far more energy to move ions out of their equilibrium
position than electrons. We have performed first principle calculations to show
that in MAPbI3 the activation energy for the I3 mechanism is appreciably lower
than the literature value of the activation energy for the electronic impact
ionization. The discovery of I3 process in perovskite material opens up
possibilities for new classes of devices for photonic and electronic

sinks of ionizing radiation, both of which were dominated by small-scale
structure and are thus usually treated in cosmological reionization simulations
by subgrid modelling. The recombination rate of intergalactic hydrogen is
customarily boosted by a subgrid clumping factor,
${\left<n^2\right>/\left<n\right>^2}$, which corrects for unresolved
fluctuations in gas density ${n}$ on scales below the grid-spacing of
coarse-grained simulations. We investigate in detail the impact of this
inhomogeneous subgrid clumping on reionization and its observables, as follows:
(1) Previous attempts generally underestimated the clumping factor because of
insufficient mass resolution. We perform a high-resolution $N$-body simulation
that resolves haloes down to the pre-reionization Jeans mass to derive the
time-dependent, spatially-varying local clumping factor and a fitting formula
for its correlation with local overdensity. (2) We then perform a large-scale
$N$-body and radiative transfer simulation that accounts for this inhomogeneous
subgrid clumping by applying this clumping factor-overdensity correlation.
Boosting recombination significantly slows the expansion of ionized regions,
which delays completion of reionization and suppresses 21 cm power spectra on
large scales in the later stages of reionization. (3) We also consider a
simplified prescription in which the globally-averaged, time-evolving clumping
factor from the same high-resolution $N$-body simulation is applied uniformly
to all cells in the reionization simulation, instead. Observables computed with
this model agree fairly well with those from the inhomogeneous clumping model,
e.g. predicting 21 cm power spectra to within 20% error, suggesting it may be a
useful approximation.

  p.766-777, 2020",,,"cs.GT econ.GN math.DS nlin.CD physics.soc-ph q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Routing games are amongst the most studied classes of games. Their two most
well-known properties are that learning dynamics converge to equilibria and
that all equilibria are approximately optimal. In this work, we perform a
stress test for these classic results by studying the ubiquitous dynamics,
Multiplicative Weights Update, in different classes of congestion games,
uncovering intricate non-equilibrium phenomena. As the system demand increases,
the learning dynamics go through period-doubling bifurcations, leading to
instabilities, chaos and large inefficiencies even in the simplest case of
non-atomic routing games with two paths of linear cost where the Price of
Anarchy is equal to one.
  Starting with this simple class, we show that every system has a carrying
capacity, above which it becomes unstable. If the equilibrium flow is a
symmetric $50-50\%$ split, the system exhibits one period-doubling bifurcation.
A single periodic attractor of period two replaces the attracting fixed point.
Although the Price of Anarchy is equal to one, in the large population limit
the time-average social cost for all but a zero measure set of initial
conditions converges to its worst possible value. For asymmetric equilibrium
flows, increasing the demand eventually forces the system into Li-Yorke chaos
with positive topological entropy and periodic orbits of all possible periods.
Remarkably, in all non-equilibrating regimes, the time-average flows on the
paths converge exactly to the equilibrium flows, a property akin to no-regret
learning in zero-sum games. These results are robust. We extend them to routing
games with arbitrarily many strategies, polynomial cost functions, non-atomic
as well as atomic routing games and heteregenous users. Our results are also
applicable to any sequence of shrinking learning rates, e.g., $1/\sqrt{T}$, by
allowing for a dynamically increasing population size.

Interestingly the Killing symmetries in General Relativity (GR) are shown to
provide a subtle clue to the quantum gravity. The NP gravity is shown to
incorporate a $(B_{2}$$ \wedge $$F_{2})$ coupling, sourced by a non-Newtonian
potential, to an exact geometry in GR. Remarkably the NP correction is
identified as a mass dipole and is shown to be sourced by a propagating GT. A
detailed analysis is performed in a bulk GT to show a modification to the
precession of perihelion in a boundary NP gravity. The perspective of an
electromagnetic (EM) wave in the bulk is investigated to reveal a spin $2$
(mass-less) quantum sourced by an apparent 2-form. A Goldstone scalar is
absorbed by the apparent 2-form to describe a massive $2$-form in the coulomb

high-capacity wireless network access. However, the benefits of mmW are limited
by the fact that the channel between a mmW access point and the user equipment
can stochastically change due to severe blockage of mmW links by obstacles such
as the human body. Thus, one main challenge of mmW network coverage is to
enable directional line-of-sight links between access points and mobile
devices. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for optimizing mmW
network coverage within hotspots and in-venue regions, while being cognizant of
the body blockage of the network's users. In the studied model, the locations
of potential access points and users are assumed as predefined parameters while
the orientation of the users is assumed to be stochastic. Hence, a joint
stochastic access point placement and beam steering problem subjected to
stochastic users' body blockage is formulated, under desired network coverage
constraints. Then, a greedy algorithm is introduced to find an approximation
solution for the joint deployment and assignment problem using a new `size
constrained weighted set cover' approach. A closed-form expression for the
ratio between the optimal solution and approximate one (resulting from the
greedy algorithm) is analytically derived. The proposed algorithm is simulated
for three in-venue regions: the meeting room in the Alumni Assembly Hall of
Virginia Tech, an airport gate, and one side of a stadium football. Simulation
results show that, in order to guarantee network coverage for different
in-venue regions, the greedy algorithm uses at most three more access points
(APs) compared to the optimal solution. The results also show that, due to the
use of the additional APs, the greedy algorithm will yield a network coverage
up to 11.7 % better than the optimal, AP-minimizing solution.

messages with different IDs are typically sent at different times and with

Furthermore, this implies a strong \textit{a priori} on the parametric form of

characterizing the generalization performance of a DNN. The metric can be
disentangled into an information-theoretic non-robust component, responsible
for adversarial behavior, and a robust component. Then, we show by experiments
that current DNNs rely heavily on optimizing the non-robust component in
achieving decent performance. We also demonstrate that current state-of-the-art

them from using the non-robust component to distinguish samples from different

the possible direction for achieving decent standard performance and

with the fundamental principle of Background Independence. Ultimately the
background metric it formally depends on is selected self-consistently by means
of a suitable generalization of Einstein's equation. Self-consistent backround
spacetimes are scale dependent, and therefore ""going on-shell"" at the points
along a given renormalization group (RG) trajectory requires understanding two
types of scale dependencies: the (familiar) direct one carried by the off-shell
action functional, and an indirect one related to the self-consistent
background geometry. This paper is devoted to a careful delineation and
analysis of certain general questions concerning the indirect scale dependence,
as well as a detailed explicit investigation of the case where the
self-consistent metrics are determined predominantly by the RG running of the
cosmological constant. Mathematically, the object of interest is the spectral
flow induced by the background Laplacian which, on-shell, acquires an explicit
scale dependence. It encodes the information about the specific set of field
modes which, at any given scale, are the degrees of freedom constituting the
respective effective field theory. For a large class of RG trajectories we
discover a seemingly paradoxical behavior: the theory looses rather than gains
degrees of freedom at increasing energies. As an application, we investigate to
what extent it is possible to reformulate the exact theory in terms of matter
and gravity fluctuations on a rigid flat space. It turns out that, in vacuo,
this ""rigid picture"" breaks down after a very short RG time. Furthermore, we
reanalyze, and refute the claim that the huge energy densities one obtains in
standard quantum field theory by summing up to zero-point energies imply a
naturalness problem for the observed small value of the cosmological constant.

Frenkel excitons in organic materials emerged as a versatile, room-temperature
compatible platform to study nonlinear many-particle physics and bosonic
condensation. However, various aspects of the optical response of Frenkel
excitons in this regime remained largely unexplored. Here, we utilize a
hemispheric optical cavity filled with the fluorescent protein mCherry to
address two important questions in the field of room-temperature polariton
condensates. First, combining the high quality factor of the microcavity with a
well-defined mode structure allows us to provide a definite answer whether
temporal coherence in such systems can become competitive with their
low-temperature counterparts. We observe highly monochromatic and coherent
light beams emitted from the condensate, characterized by a coherence time
greater than 150$\,$ps, which exceeds the polariton lifetime by two orders of
magnitude. Second, the high quality of our device allows to sensibly trace the
emission energy of the condensate, and thus to establish a fundamental picture
which quantitatively explains the core nonlinear processes yielding the
characteristic density-dependent blueshift. We find that the energy shift of
Frenkel exciton-polaritons is largely dominated by the reduction of the
Rabi-splitting due to phase space filling effects, which is influenced by the
redistribution of polaritons in the system. While our finding of highly
coherent condensation at ambient conditions addresses the suitability of
organic polaritonics regarding their utilization as highly coherent room
temperature polariton lasers, shedding light on the non-linearity is of great
benefit towards implementing non-linear devices, optical switches, and lattices
based on exciton-polaritons at room temperature.

for the pulsar interaction with the accretion disk capable of explaining the
observed behavior. We suggest that during the high mode the disk is truncated
outside the light cylinder, allowing the pulsar wind to develop near the
equatorial plane and strike the disk. The dissipative wind-disk collision
energizes the disk particles and generates synchrotron emission, which peaks in
the X-ray band and extends down to the optical band. The emission is modulated
by the pulsar wind rotation, resulting in a pulse profile with two peaks
180\degr\ apart. This picture explains the high-mode luminosity, spectrum, and
pulse profile (X-ray and optical) of PSR J1023+0038. It may also explain the
X-ray flares as events of sudden increase in the effective disk cross section
intercepting the wind. In contrast to previously proposed models, we suggest
that the disk penetrates the light cylinder only during the low X-ray mode.
This penetration suppresses the dissipation caused by the pulsar wind-disk
collision, and the system enters the propeller regime. The small duty cycle of
the propeller explains the low spindown rate of the pulsar.

the high-energy emission bump is dominated by inverse Compton emission) the
energy density of any external soft radiation field (e.g. produced by a layer
surrounding the jet or in the accretion flow) cannot be larger than few times
that associated to the observed synchrotron radiation produced in the emission
region. Quite interestingly, the constraint that we derive is generally
stronger than the limit obtained from the condition that the source is
transparent to very-high energy $\gamma$-rays. Using this constraint we can
derive a robust upper limit for the efficiency of the photopion reaction
leading to the emission of PeV neutrinos, $f_{\pi}\lesssim 10^{-5}$, which
makes HBL quite inefficient neutrino sources. For the photodisintegration of
nuclei the results are more dependent on the spectral properties of the
radiation field. The photodisintegration efficiency is safely below 1 (and
nuclei can escape intact) for a `canonical' spectrum of the soft radiation
field $\propto \nu^{-0.5}$. For radiation fields characterized by a softer
spectrum and extended over a large portion of the jet, the efficiency increases

motivation, we study the reuse of an available large QG dataset in a secondary

supervised training for QG in both languages. We demonstrate the efficacy of
our proposed approach using two different primary languages, Hindi and Chinese.

remains unclear how the friction coefficient depends on the number of
crosslinkers and the size of the overlap between the microtubules. Here, we use
theory and computer simulations to study the friction between two filaments
that are crosslinked by passive proteins, which can hop between neighboring
binding sites while physically excluding each other. The simulations reveal
that the movement of one microtubule relative to the other is limited by
free-energy barrier crossings, causing rare and discrete jumps of the
microtubule that span the distance between adjacent crosslinker binding sites.
We derive an exact analytical expression for the free-energy landscape and
identify the reaction coordinate that governs the relative movement, which

operational data are sparsely distributed, we design an algorithm leveraging
cross entropy minimization.

the general efficiency of the approach. The results show that, compared with
simple random sampling, this approach requires only about a half of labeled

contrast-enhanced MRI data. However, the model-fitting can produce unreliable
results due to the limited data acquired and the high noise levels. Such
problems are especially prevalent in myocardial perfusion MRI leading to the
compromise of constrained numerical deconvolutions and segmental signal
averaging being commonly used as alternatives to the more complex
tracer-kinetic models. Methods: In this work, the use of hierarchical Bayesian
inference for the parameter estimation is explored. It is shown that with
Bayesian inference it is possible to reliably fit the two-compartment exchange
model to perfusion data. The use of prior knowledge on the ranges of kinetic
parameters and the fact that neighbouring voxels are likely to have similar
kinetic properties combined with a Markov chain Monte Carlo based fitting
procedure significantly improves the reliability of the perfusion estimates
with compared to the traditional least-squares approach. The method is assessed
using both simulated and patient data. Results: The average (standard
deviation) normalised mean square error for the distinct noise realisations of
a simulation phantom falls from 0.32 (0.55) with the least-squares fitting to
0.13 (0.2) using Bayesian inference. The assessment of the presence of coronary
artery disease based purely on the quantitative MBF maps obtained using
Bayesian inference matches the visual assessment in all 24 slices. When using
the maps obtained by the least-squares fitting, a corresponding assessment is
only achieved in 16/24 slices. Conclusion: Bayesian inference allows a

similar, iodomethane and iodobenzene molecules are more ionized than xenon
atoms. Moreover, we predict that the average total charge of iodobenzene is
much larger than that of iodomethane, because of the large number of electrons
in the benzene ring. The positive charges transferred from the iodine site to
the benzene ring are redistributed such that the higher carbon charges are
formed at the far end from the iodine site. Our first-principles calculations
provide fundamental insights into the interaction of molecules with x-ray
free-electron laser (XFEL) pulses. These insights need to be taken into account
for interpreting and designing future XFEL experiments.

properties of cubic and tetragonal STO by comparing the recently implemented
strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA functional with
the generalized gradient approximation (PBE96 and PBEsol) and the hybrid

the structural properties, in particular the rotational angle of the tetragonal

of a Hubbard $U$-term (SCAN+$U$, $U=7.45$ eV) allows to achieve the
experimental band gap of 3.25 eV with a moderate increase in the lattice
constant, whereas within GGA+$U$ the gap is underestimated even for high $U$
values. The effect of the exchange-correlation functional on the optical
properties is progressively reduced from 1.5 eV variance in the onset of the

many-body effects within the framework of the $GW$ approximation (single-shot
$G_0W_0$) and excitonic corrections by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation

of the optical spectrum at a lower cost compared to $G_0W_0$+BSE. Strong

properties of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies
are in excellent agreement with previous studies using the 2013 and 2015 data
releases. In particular, they are consistent with the Gaussian predictions of
the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, yet also confirm the presence of several
so-called ""anomalies"" on large angular scales. The novelty of the current
study, however, lies in being a first attempt at a comprehensive analysis of
the statistics of the polarization signal over all angular scales, using either
maps of the Stokes parameters, $Q$ and $U$, or the $E$-mode signal derived from
these using a new methodology (which we describe in an appendix). Although
remarkable progress has been made in reducing the systematic effects that
contaminated the 2015 polarization maps on large angular scales, it is still
the case that residual systematics (and our ability to simulate them) can limit
some tests of non-Gaussianity and isotropy. However, a detailed set of null
tests applied to the maps indicates that these issues do not dominate the
analysis on intermediate and large angular scales (i.e., $\ell \lesssim 400$).
In this regime, no unambiguous detections of cosmological non-Gaussianity, or
of anomalies corresponding to those seen in temperature, are claimed. Notably,
the stacking of CMB polarization signals centred on the positions of
temperature hot and cold spots exhibits excellent agreement with the
$\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, and also gives a clear indication of how
Planck provides state-of-the-art measurements of CMB temperature and
polarization on degree scales.

screening that is similar to the Kondo resonance observed in the differential

of the tunneling amplitudes for electron tunneling from the STM tip into the

that the Fano factor can be enhanced or suppressed due to interference effects
and as such, is not only a sensitive probe for the correlation effects arising

with quiescent periods. During an accretion outburst, the NS heats up due to
exothermic accretion-induced processes taking place in the crust. Besides the
long-known deep crustal heating of nuclear origin, a likely non-nuclear source
of heat, dubbed 'shallow heating', is present at lower densities. Most of the
accretion-induced heat slowly diffuses into the core on a timescale of years.
Over many outburst cycles, a state of equilibrium is reached when the core
temperature is high enough that the heating and cooling (photon and neutrino
emission) processes are in balance. We investigate how stellar characteristics
and outburst properties affect the long-term temperature evolution of a
transiently accreting NS. For the first time the effects of crustal properties
are considered, particularly that of shallow heating. Using our code NSCool, we
tracked the thermal evolution of a NS undergoing outbursts over a period of
$10^5$ yr. The outburst sequence is based on the regular outbursts observed
from Aql X-1. For each model, we calculated the timescale over which
equilibrium was reached and we present these timescales along with the
temperature and luminosity parameters of the equilibrium state. We find that
shallow heating significantly contributes to the equilibrium state. Increasing
its strength raises the equilibrium core temperature. We find that if deep
crustal heating is replaced by shallow heating alone, the core would still heat
up, reaching only a 2% lower equilibrium core temperature. Deep crustal heating
may therefore not be vital to the heating of the core. Additionally, shallow
heating can increase the quiescent luminosity to values higher than previously
expected.

points in most literature and minimize the gap for applications. The challenges
are that the motion pattern of the target is unknown and modeling its dynamics
is infeasible. To resolve these issues, the dynamics of the target is modeled
by a constant-velocity model and is employed as a process model in the
unscented Kalman filter (UKF), but process noise is uncertain and sensitive to
system instability. To ensure convergence of the estimate error, the noise
covariance matrix is estimated according to history data within a moving
window. The estimated motion from the UKF is implemented as a feedforward term
in the developed controller, so that tracking performance is enhanced.
Simulations are demonstrated to verify the efficacy of the developed estimator

algorithms, we study how the adiabatic gap depends on the spectra of the

show that perhaps counter-intuitively, changing the energy in the initial and
final Hamiltonians of only highly excited states (we do this by assigning all
eigenstates above a certain cutoff the same value), can turn the adiabatic
algorithm from being successful to failing. Interestingly, our system exhibits
a phase transition; when the cutoff in the spectrum becomes smaller than
roughly $n/2$, $n$ being the number of qubits, the behavior transitions from a
successful adiabatic process to a failed one. To analyze this behavior, and
provide an upper bound on both the minimal gap as well as the success of the
adiabatic algorithm, we introduce the notion of ""escape rate"", which quantifies
the rate by which the system escapes the initial ground state (a related notion
was also used by Ilin and Lychkovskiy in arXiv:1805.04083). Our results
indicate a phenomenon that is interesting on its own right: an adiabatic

microscopic Hamiltonian can in general only approximately be described by a
time local master equation. The quality of that approximation depends primarily
on the coupling strength and the structure of the environment. Various such
master equations have been proposed with different aims. Choosing the most
suitable one for a specific system is not straight forward. By focusing on the
accuracy of the reduced dynamics we provide a thorough assessment for a
selection of methods (Redfield Equation, Quantum Optical Master Equation,
Coarse-Grained Master Equation, a related dynamical map approach and a
partial-secular approximation). Whether or not an approach guarantees
positivity we consider secondary, here. We use two qubits coupled to a
Lorentzian environment in a spin-boson like fashion modeling a generic
situation with various system and bath time scales. We see that, independent of
the initial state, the simple Redfield Equation with time dependent
coefficients is significantly more accurate than all other methods under
consideration. We emphasize that positivity violation in the Redfield formalism
becomes relevant only in a regime where any of the perturbative master
equations considered here are rendered invalid anyway. This implies that the
loss of positivity should in fact be welcomed as an important feature: it
indicates the breakdown of the weak coupling assumption. In addition we present
the various approaches in a self-contained way and use the behavior of their
errors to provide further insight into the range of validity of each method.

concepts from granular mechanics, often overlooking the effect of cementation.
To probe the key differences between sand and sandstone mechanics, we performed
triaxial deformation experiments on Ottawa quartz sand at $5-40$ MPa effective
confining pressure. At $5$ MPa, the samples are able to dilate. At higher
confinement, the aggregates show continuous compaction, displaying strain
hardening. The stress-strain behaviour is non-linear and the exact onset of
inelastic compaction could not be determined accurately. Measured P-wave
velocities show the development of anisotropy. With increasing axial strain,
the along-axis velocities tend to increase, while velocities perpendicular to
the compression axis tend to decrease (at low pressure) or remain constant (at
high pressure). In samples deformed under elevated pressure conditions,
acoustic emission event locations are diffuse. Microstructural investigations
show an increase in grain chipping and crushing with increasing confining
pressure, but no evidence of localised compaction could be observed. The nature
of the pore-fluid, either decane or water, does not significantly influence the
mechanical behaviour at strain rates of $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-4}$ $s^{-1}$. Grain
angularity and grain-size distribution also did not significantly change the
mechanical behaviour. We infer that our observations indicate that the lack of
cementation introduces additional degrees of freedom for grains to slide,
rotate, and reorganise at the sample-scale, precluding the existence and
sustainability of stress concentrations beyond the grain-scale. This results in
progressive compaction and hardening, and lack of compaction localisation.

measure of the suboptimality of any primal-dual point. In classical mechanics
the equations of motion of a system can be derived from the Hamiltonian
function, which is a quantity that describes the total energy of the system. In
this paper we consider a convex optimization problem consisting of the sum of
two convex functions, sometimes referred to as a composite objective, and we
identify the duality gap to be the 'energy' of the system. In the Hamiltonian
formalism the energy is conserved, so we add a contractive term to the standard
equations of motion so that this energy decreases linearly (i.e.,
geometrically) with time. This yields a continuous-time ordinary differential
equation (ODE) in the primal and dual variables which converges to zero duality
gap, i.e., optimality. This ODE has several useful properties: it induces a
natural operator splitting; at convergence it yields both the primal and dual
solutions; and it is invariant to affine transformation despite only using
first order information. We provide several discretizations of this ODE, some
of which are new algorithms and others correspond to known techniques, such as
the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We conclude with some
numerical examples that show the promise of our approach. We give an example

generalize well when trained by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The
consensus explanation that has emerged credits the randomized nature of SGD for
the bias of the training process towards low-complexity models and, thus, for
implicit regularization. We take a careful look at this explanation in the
context of image classification with common deep neural network architectures.
We find that if we do not regularize \emph{explicitly}, then SGD can be easily
made to converge to poorly-generalizing, high-complexity models: all it takes
is to first train on a random labeling on the data, before switching to
properly training with the correct labels. In contrast, we find that in the
presence of explicit regularization, pretraining with random labels has no
detrimental effect on SGD. We believe that our results give evidence that
explicit regularization plays a far more important role in the success of
overparameterized neural networks than what has been understood until now.
Specifically, by penalizing complicated models independently of their fit to
the data, regularization affects training dynamics also far away from optima,
making simple models that fit the data well discoverable by local methods, such
as SGD.

modulus as a function of time. We observe that the creep curves, as well as
strain recovery, show a significant dependence on waiting time elapsed since
shear melting. The corrected strain, which is the strain in excess of the
recovered strain, has been observed to show time waiting time superposition in
the effective time domain, wherein time is normalized by time-dependent
relaxation time that shows a power-law dependence. The corresponding power law
exponent, which is close to unity in a limit of small stresses, decreases with
stress and tends to zero as stress approaches the yield stress. For a range of
stresses, the material shows time stress superposition suggesting the shape of
the evolving relaxation time spectrum to be independent of the time as well as
the stress. This work, therefore, suggests the presence of physical aging in an
aqueous dispersion of Carbopol even though the elastic modulus shows only a
weak enhancement. We also discuss Andrade type of creep behavior in aqueous

single point. More precisely, we allow small initial data localized around any
finite collection of points which can be arbitrarily far from one another.
Existing techniques do not directly apply to this setting because they require
norms with radial weights away from some center to be small. The smallness we
require on the data is measured in a norm which does not depend on the scale of
the configuration of the data.
  Our method of proof relies on a close analysis of the geometry of the
interaction between waves originating from different sources. We prove
estimates on the bilinear forms encoding the interaction, which allow us to
show improved bounds for the energy of the solution. We finally apply a variant
of the vector field method involving modified Klainerman--Sobolev estimates to
prove global stability. As a corollary of our proof, we are able to show global

often be significantly improved by using soft targets that are a weighted
average of the hard targets and the uniform distribution over labels. Smoothing
the labels in this way prevents the network from becoming over-confident and
label smoothing has been used in many state-of-the-art models, including image
classification, language translation and speech recognition. Despite its
widespread use, label smoothing is still poorly understood. Here we show
empirically that in addition to improving generalization, label smoothing
improves model calibration which can significantly improve beam-search.
However, we also observe that if a teacher network is trained with label
smoothing, knowledge distillation into a student network is much less
effective. To explain these observations, we visualize how label smoothing
changes the representations learned by the penultimate layer of the network. We
show that label smoothing encourages the representations of training examples
from the same class to group in tight clusters. This results in loss of
information in the logits about resemblances between instances of different
classes, which is necessary for distillation, but does not hurt generalization
or calibration of the model's predictions.

OGLE-2015-BLG-0060 based on observations obtained from 13 different telescopes.
Intensive coverage of the anomalous parts of the light curve was achieved by
automated follow-up observations from the robotic telescopes of the Las Cumbres
Observatory. We show that, for the first time, all main features of an
anomalous microlensing event are well covered by follow-up data, allowing us to
estimate the physical parameters of the lens. The strong detection of
second-order effects in the event light curve necessitates the inclusion of
longer-baseline survey data in order to constrain the parallax vector. We find
that the event was most likely caused by a stellar binary-lens with masses
$M_{\star1} = 0.87 \pm 0.12 M_{\odot}$ and $M_{\star2} = 0.77 \pm 0.11
M_{\odot}$. The distance to the lensing system is 6.41 $\pm 0.14$ kpc and the
projected separation between the two components is 13.85 $\pm 0.16$ AU.
Alternative interpretations are also considered.

discrete choices, where the consumer chooses at most one product in a category,
but selects from multiple categories in parallel. The consumer's utility is
additive in the different categories. Her preferences about product attributes
as well as her price sensitivity vary across products and are in general
correlated across products. We build on techniques from the machine learning
literature on probabilistic models of matrix factorization, extending the
methods to account for time-varying product attributes and products going out
of stock. We evaluate the performance of the model using held-out data from
weeks with price changes or out of stock products. We show that our model
improves over traditional modeling approaches that consider each category in
isolation. One source of the improvement is the ability of the model to
accurately estimate heterogeneity in preferences (by pooling information across
categories); another source of improvement is its ability to estimate the
preferences of consumers who have rarely or never made a purchase in a given
category in the training data. Using held-out data, we show that our model can
accurately distinguish which consumers are most price sensitive to a given

substantially increases the benefits of personalization in discounts.

proposes the first data-driven inverse optimization approach to measuring

clinical pathway concordance for stage III colon cancer. We develop a novel
concordance metric and demonstrate using real patient data from Ontario, Canada
that it has a statistically significant association with survival. Our
methodological approach considers a patient's journey as a walk in a directed
graph, where the costs on the arcs are derived by solving an inverse shortest

find the arc costs: reference pathways developed by a provincial cancer agency
(primary) and data from real-world patient-related activity from patients with
both positive and negative clinical outcomes (secondary). Thus, our inverse
optimization framework extends existing models by including data points of both
varying ""primacy"" and ""alignment"". Data primacy is addressed through a
two-stage approach to imputing the cost vector, while data alignment is
addressed by a hybrid objective function that aims to minimize and maximize

validity and reliability of forensic analyses. More specifically, these

conclusions drawn from forensic analyses. ""Black box"" studies for the various
subjective feature-based comparison methods are intended for this purpose.
  In general, ""black box"" studies often have unbalanced designs, comparisons
that are not independent, and missing data. These aspects pose difficulty in
the analysis of the results and are often ignored. Instead, interpretation of
the data relies on methods that assume independence between observations and a
balanced experiment. Furthermore, all of these projects are interpreted within
the frequentist framework and result in point estimates associated with
confidence intervals that are confusing to communicate and understand.
  We propose to use an existing likelihood-free Bayesian inference method,
called Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), that is capable of handling
unbalanced designs, dependencies among the observations, and missing data. ABC
allows for studying the parameters of interest without recourse to incoherent
and misleading measures of uncertainty such as confidence intervals. By taking
into account information from all decision categories for a given examiner and
information from the population of examiners, our method also allows for
quantifying the risk of error for the given examiner, even when no error has
been recorded for that examiner.

In this model, each job $j$ has a processing requirement (length) $v_{ij}$ and
arrives with a nonnegative nondecreasing cost function $g_{ij}(t)$ if it has
been dispatched to machine $i$, and this information is revealed to the system
upon arrival of job $j$ at time $r_j$. The goal is to dispatch the jobs to the
machines in an online fashion and process them preemptively on the machines so
as to minimize the generalized completion time $\sum_{j}g_{i(j)j}(C_j)$. Here
$i(j)$ refers to the machine to which job $j$ is dispatched, and $C_j$ is the
completion time of job $j$ on that machine. It is assumed that jobs cannot
migrate between machines and that each machine can work on a single job at any
time instance. In particular, we are interested in finding an online scheduling
policy whose objective cost is competitive with respect to a slower optimal
offline benchmark, i.e., the one that knows all the job specifications a priori
and is slower than the online algorithm. We first show that for the case of a
single machine and special cost functions $g_j(t)=w_jg(t)$, with nonnegative
nondecreasing $g(t)$, the highest-density-first rule is optimal for the
generalized fractional completion time. We then extend this result by giving a
speed-augmented competitive algorithm for the general nondecreasing cost
functions $g_j(t)$ by utilizing a novel optimal control framework. This
approach provides a principled method for identifying dual variables in
different settings of online job scheduling with general cost functions. Using
this method, we also provide a speed-augmented competitive algorithm for

competitive ratio depends on the curvature of cost functions $g_{ij}(t)$.

and large wind turbines. Recent studies show that these two noise problems can
be modelled analytically using the Wiener-Hopf method. However, the resulting
models involve infinite-interval integrals that cannot be evaluated
analytically, and consequently implementing them poses practical difficulty.
This paper develops easily-implementable noise prediction models for flat
plates with serrated leading and trailing edges, respectively. By exploiting
the fact that high-order modes are cut-off and adjacent modes do not interfere
in the far field except at sufficiently high frequencies, an infinite-interval
integral involving two infinite sums is approximated by a single
straightforward sum. Numerical comparison shows that the resulting models serve
as excellent approximations to the original models. Good agreement is also
achieved when the leading-edge model predictions are compared with experimental
results for sawtooth serrations of various root-to-tip amplitudes. Importantly,
the models developed in this paper can be evaluated robustly in a very
efficient manner. For example, a typical far-field noise spectrum can be
calculated within milliseconds for both the trailing- and leading-edge noise
models on a standard desktop computer. Due to their efficiency and ease of
numerical implementation, these models are expected to be of particular
importance in applications where a numerical optimization is likely to be

  Multi-Agent Systems","23 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.MA cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a class of distributed event-triggered algorithms that
solve the average consensus problem in multi-agent systems. By designing events
such that a specifically chosen Lyapunov function is monotonically decreasing,
event-triggered algorithms succeed in reducing communications among agents
while still ensuring that the entire system converges to the desired state.
However, depending on the chosen Lyapunov function the transient behaviors can
be very different. Moreover, performance requirements also vary from
application to application. Consequently, we are instead interested in
considering a class of Lyapunov functions such that each Lyapunov function
produces a different event-triggered coordination algorithm to solve the
multi-agent average consensus problem. The proposed class of algorithms all
guarantee exponential convergence of the resulting system and exclusion of Zeno
behaviors. This allows us to easily implement different algorithms that all
guarantee correctness to meet varying performance needs. We show that our
findings can be applied to the practical clock synchronization problem in
wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and further corroborate their effectiveness
with simulation results.

distributions over large discrete domains. Unlike classification or regression
where a wide variety of loss functions are used, in the distribution learning
and density estimation literature, very few losses outside the dominant $log\
loss$ are applied. We aim to understand this fact, taking an axiomatic approach
to the design of loss functions for learning distributions. We start by
proposing a set of desirable criteria that any good loss function should
satisfy. Intuitively, these criteria require that the loss function faithfully
evaluates a candidate distribution, both in expectation and when estimated on a
few samples. Interestingly, we observe that \emph{no loss function} possesses
all of these criteria. However, one can circumvent this issue by introducing a
natural restriction on the set of candidate distributions. Specifically, we
require that candidates are $calibrated$ with respect to the target
distribution, i.e., they may contain less information than the target but
otherwise do not significantly distort the truth. We show that, after
restricting to this set of distributions, the log loss, along with a large
variety of other losses satisfy the desired criteria. These results pave the
way for future investigations of distribution learning that look beyond the log
loss, choosing a loss function based on application or domain need.

In turn, we presume that the native population is heterogenous and consists of
high-skill and low-skill workers. The presence of assimilated migrants might
shape the comparison group of the natives, influencing the relative deprivation
of the low-skill workers and, in consequence, the choice to form human capital

choices of migrants and skill formation of natives, we construct a
coevolutionary model of the open-to-migration economy. Showing that the economy
might end up in a non-assimilation equilibrium, we discuss welfare consequences
of an assimilation policy funded from tax levied on the native population. We
identify conditions under which such costly policy can bring the migrants to
assimilation and at the same time increase the welfare of the natives, even

of the signal. Although the interpolation methods for periodic sampling have
been a topic of research for a long time, there is a lack of study in methods
capable of taking advantage of the Lebesgue sampling characteristics to
reconstruct time series more accurately. Indeed, Lebesgue sampling contains
additional information about the shape of the signal in-between two sampled
points. Using this information would allow us to generate an interpolated
signal closer to the original one. That is to say, the average distance between
the interpolated signal and the original signal will be smaller than a signal
interpolated with other interpolation methods. In this paper, we propose two
novel time series interpolation methods specifically designed for Lebesgue
sampling called ZeLiC and ZeChipC. ZeLiC is an algorithm that combines both
Zero-order hold interpolation and Linear interpolation to reconstruct time
series. ZeChipC is a similar idea, it is a combination of Zero-order hold and
PCHIP interpolation. Zero-order hold interpolation is favourable for
interpolating abrupt changes while Linear and PCHIP interpolation are more
suitable for smooth transitions. In order to apply one method or the other, we
have introduced a new concept called tolerated region. ZeLiC and ZeChipC
include a new functionality to adapt the reconstructed signal to concave/convex
regions. The proposed methods have been compared with the state-of-the-art
interpolation methods using Lebesgue sampling and have offered higher average
performance. Additionally, we have compared the performance of the methods
using both Riemann and Lebesgue sampling using an approximate number of sampled
points. The performance of the combination ""Lebesgue sampling with ZeChipC

requirement in many applications. Variance is harder to control in a cloud
deployment in the presence of stragglers. In spite of this challenge, inference
is increasingly being done in the cloud, due to the advent of affordable
machine learning as a service (MLaaS) platforms. Existing approaches to reduce
variance rely on replication which is expensive and partially negates the
affordability of MLaaS. In this work, we argue that MLaaS platforms also
provide unique opportunities to cut the cost of redundancy. In MLaaS platforms,
multiple inference requests are concurrently received by a load balancer which
can then create a more cost-efficient redundancy coding across a larger
collection of images. We propose a novel convolutional neural network model,
Collage-CNN, to provide a low-cost redundancy framework. A Collage-CNN model
takes a collage formed by combining multiple images and performs multi-image
classification in one shot, albeit at slightly lower accuracy. We then augment
a collection of traditional single image classifiers with a single Collage-CNN
classifier which acts as a low-cost redundant backup. Collage-CNN then provides
backup classification results if a single image classification straggles.
Deploying the Collage-CNN models in the cloud, we demonstrate that the 99th
percentile tail latency of inference can be reduced by 1.47X compared to
replication based approaches while providing high accuracy. Also, variation in
inference latency can be reduced by 9X with a slight increase in average
inference latency.

inherently time-delayed. These time-delays can not only slow the network but
can have a destabilizing effect on the network's dynamics leading to poor
performance. The same is true in computational networks used for machine
learning etc. where time-delays increase the network's memory but can degrade
the network's ability to be trained. However, not all networks can be
destabilized by time-delays. Previously, it has been shown that if a network or
high-dimensional dynamical system is intrinsically stable, which is a stronger
form of the standard notion of global stability, then it maintains its
stability when constant time-delays are introduced into the system. Here we
show that intrinsically stable systems, including intrinsically stable networks
and a broad class of switched systems, i.e. systems whose mapping is
time-dependent, remain stable in the presence of any type of time-varying
time-delays whether these delays are periodic, stochastic, or otherwise. We
apply these results to a number of well-studied systems to demonstrate that the
notion of intrinsic stability is both computationally inexpensive, relative to
other methods, and can be used to improve on some of the best known stability
results. We also show that the asymptotic state of an intrinsically stable
switched system is exponentially independent of the system's initial

first-principles calculation, we demonstrate monolayer chromium iodide arsenide
(CrIAs), an undiscovered stable two-dimensional material, is an intrinsic
ferromagnetic semiconductor with out-of-plane spin magnetization. The indirect
bandgaps are predicted to be 0.32 eV for majority spin and 3.31 eV for minority
spin, large enough to preserve semiconducting features at room temperature. Its
Curie temperature, estimated by Heisenberg model with magnetic anisotropic
energy using Monte Carlo method, is as high as 655 K that well above the room
temperature, owing to strong direct exchange interaction between chromium d and
iodine p orbitals. This work offers the affirmative answer of whether there
exists two-dimensional ferromagnetic semiconductor at room temperature. And the
practical realization of quantum spintronic devices, which have been suppressed
because of lacking suitable room temperature magnetic materials, would embrace
a great opportunity.

benchmark examples of a numerical method for the solution of a finite-strain
holonomic (rate-independent) Cosserat plasticity problem for materials,
possibly with microstructure. Two improvements are made in contrast to earlier
approaches: First, the micro-rotations are parameterized with the help of an
Euler-Rodrigues formula related to quaternions. Secondly, as main result, a
novel two-pass preconditioning scheme for searching the energy-minimizing
solutions based on the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldstein-Shanno
quasi-Newton method is proposed that consists of a predictor step and a
corrector-iteration. After outlining the necessary adaptations to the model,
numerical simulations compare the performance and efficiency of the new and the
old algorithm. The proposed numerical model can be effectively employed for
studying the mechanical response of complicated materials featuring large size
effects.

out that adversarial robustness is precisely what we need to directly
manipulate salient features of the input. Overall, our findings demonstrate the

  Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.MA cs.AI cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cooperation is a phenomenon that has been widely studied across many
different disciplines. In the field of computer science, the modularity and
robustness of multi-agent systems offer significant practical advantages over
individual machines. At the same time, agents using standard reinforcement
learning algorithms often fail to achieve long-term, cooperative strategies in
unstable environments when there are short-term incentives to defect. Political
philosophy, on the other hand, studies the evolution of cooperation in humans
who face similar incentives to act individualistically, but nevertheless
succeed in forming societies. Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan provides the classic
analysis of the transition from a pre-social State of Nature, where consistent
defection results in a constant state of war, to stable political community
through the institution of an absolute Sovereign. This thesis argues that
Hobbes's natural and moral philosophy are strikingly applicable to artificially
intelligent agents and aims to show that his political solutions are
experimentally successful in producing cooperation among modified Q-Learning
agents. Cooperative play is achieved in a novel Sequential Social Dilemma
called the Civilization Game, which models the State of Nature by introducing
the Hobbesian mechanisms of opponent learning awareness and majoritarian
voting, leading to the establishment of a Sovereign.

fields. A typical example is protein structure prediction, which takes an
multiple sequence alignment (MSA) as input and aims to infer structural
information from it. Almost all of the existing approaches exploit MSAs in an
indirect fashion, i.e., they transform MSAs into position-specific scoring
matrices (PSSM) that represent the distribution of amino acid types at each
column. PSSM could capture column-wise characteristics of MSA, however, the
column-wise characteristics embedded in each individual component sequence were
nearly totally neglected.
  The drawback of PSSM is rooted in the fact that an MSA is essentially an
unordered sequence set rather than a matrix. Specifically, the interchange of
any two sequences will not affect the whole MSA. In contrast, the pixels in an
image essentially form a matrix since any two rows of pixels cannot be
interchanged. Therefore, the traditional deep neural networks designed for
image processing cannot be directly applied on sequence sets. Here, we proposed
a novel deep neural network framework (called Seq-SetNet) for sequence set
processing. By employing a {\it symmetric function} module to integrate
features calculated from preceding layers, Seq-SetNet are immune to the order
of sequences in the input MSA. This advantage enables us to directly and fully
exploit MSAs by considering each component protein individually. We evaluated
Seq-SetNet by using it to extract structural information from MSA for protein
secondary structure prediction. Experimental results on popular benchmark sets
suggests that Seq-SetNet outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by 3.6% in
precision. These results clearly suggest the advantages of Seq-SetNet in
sequence set processing and it can be readily used in a wide range of fields,
say natural language processing.

is their potential use as tools for image manipulation. Recently, generative
adversarial networks (GANs) have been able to generate images of remarkable
quality. Unfortunately, adversarially-trained unconditional generator networks
have not been successful as image priors. One of the main requirements for a
network to act as a generative image prior, is being able to generate every
possible image from the target distribution. Adversarial learning often
experiences mode-collapse, which manifests in generators that cannot generate
some modes of the target distribution. Another requirement often not satisfied
is invertibility i.e. having an efficient way of finding a valid input latent
code given a required output image. In this work, we show that differently from
earlier GANs, the very recently proposed style-generators are quite easy to
invert. We use this important observation to propose style generators as
general purpose image priors. We show that style generators outperform other
GANs as well as Deep Image Prior as priors for image enhancement tasks. The
latent space spanned by style-generators satisfies linear identity-pose
relations. The latent space linearity, combined with invertibility, allows us
to animate still facial images without supervision. Extensive experiments are
performed to support the main contributions of this paper.

Existing 3D face spoofing databases, however, mostly based on 3D masks, are
restricted to small data size or poor authenticity due to the production
difficulty and high cost. In this work, we introduce the first wax figure face
database, WFFD, as one type of super-realistic 3D presentation attacks to spoof
the FRS. This database consists of 2200 images with both real and wax figure
faces (totally 4400 faces) with a high diversity from online collections.
Experiments on this database first investigate the vulnerability of three
popular FRS to this kind of new attack. Further, we evaluate the performance of
several face presentation attack detection methods to show the attack abilities
of this super-realistic face spoofing database.

arguments that such excitations, i.e. excited states of the Kohn-Sham
Hamiltonian, exist for $Z>N$, where $Z$ is the total nuclear charge and $N$ is
the number of electrons. The result applies under realistic assumptions on the
exchange-correlation functional, which we verify explicitly for the widely used
PZ81 and PW92 functionals. By contrast, and somewhat surprisingly, we find
using a method of Glaser, Martin, Grosse, and Thirring \cite{glaser1976} that
in case of the hydrogen and helium atoms, excited states do not exist in the
neutral case $Z=N$ when the self-consistent KS ground state density is replaced
by a realistic but easier to analyze approximation (in case of hydrogen, the
true Schr\""{o}dinger ground state density). Implications for interpreting minus
the HOMO eigenvalue as an approximation to the ionization potential are

inadequate due to its assumption of energy conversion, and it is incapable of
explaining the lack of change in saturation fragment length with the increase
in expansion velocity. In this paper, we present a theory to explain the
physical mechanism for fragmentation of shells and propose a highly efficient
model for predicting the number of necks after fragmentation. We recognize that
the fragmentation problem in shells is analogous to the cracking behavior of
tree bark, and closed form solutions is obtained to describe the relationship
between the expansion velocity and the number of necks with consideration of
the strain rate dependent strength of the shell material. The theoretical
results show excellent correlation with the experimental results.

is that, depending on the technology used, optical weighting elements may not
