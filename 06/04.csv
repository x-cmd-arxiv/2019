half-leaf veins for a one-way road and the harp-like shape for a two-way road.
Voltage swings are also detected while the vehicles move in the two-way road

is used to characterize the maximum length of a road as well as the maximum

patterns is one measure of expressivity; and the maximum number of patterns
grows exponentially with the depth. However, recent work has showed that the
practical expressivity of deep networks - the functions they can learn rather
than express - is often far from the theoretical maximum. In this paper, we
show that the average number of activation patterns for ReLU networks at
initialization is bounded by the total number of neurons raised to the input
dimension. We show empirically that this bound, which is independent of the
depth, is tight both at initialization and during training, even on
memorization tasks that should maximize the number of activation patterns. Our
work suggests that realizing the full expressivity of deep networks may not be
possible in practice, at least with current methods.

remains far less understood. This paper investigates the ductile fracture
process in commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) with particular emphasis on the
influence of grain orientation and local state of strain on void growth. An
experimental approach was developed to directly relate the growth of a void in
three dimensions to its underlying grain orientation. Grain orientation was
obtained by electron back scattered diffraction on void-containing CP-Ti sheets
prior to their diffusion bonding. Changes in void dimensions were measured
during in-situ straining within an x-ray tomography system. The strong
influence of the embedded grain orientation and that of its neighbors on void
growth rate and coalescence has been experimentally quantified. Finite element
crystal plasticity simulations that take into account both grain orientation
and the local strain state were found to predict the experimental void growth.
Grains where basal slip dominates show the largest void growth rates because
they are closer to a plane strain condition that favors void growth and
coalescence.

maximizing mutual information between features extracted from multiple views of
a shared context. For example, one could produce multiple views of a local
spatio-temporal context by observing it from different locations (e.g., camera
positions within a scene), and via different modalities (e.g., tactile,
auditory, or visual). Or, an ImageNet image could provide a context from which
one produces multiple views by repeatedly applying data augmentation.
Maximizing mutual information between features extracted from these views
requires capturing information about high-level factors whose influence spans
multiple views -- e.g., presence of certain objects or occurrence of certain
events.
  Following our proposed approach, we develop a model which learns image
representations that significantly outperform prior methods on the tasks we
consider. Most notably, using self-supervised learning, our model learns
representations which achieve 68.1% accuracy on ImageNet using standard linear
evaluation. This beats prior results by over 12% and concurrent results by 7%.
When we extend our model to use mixture-based representations, segmentation

and techniques,ranging from exploration and presentation of static data, to
probabilistic classification, or identifying changes or irregularities in
streaming data. With the pervasiveness of embedded systems and digitisation,
this latter type of streaming and evolving data becomes more important.
Nevertheless, research in density estimation has so far focused on stationary
data, leaving the task of of extrapolating and predicting density at time
points outside a training window an open problem. For this task, Temporal
Density Extrapolation (TDX) is proposed. This novel method models and predicts
gradual monotonous changes in a distribution. It is based on the expansion of
basis functions, whose weights are modelled as functions of compositional data
over time by using an isometric log-ratio transformation. Extrapolated density
estimates are then obtained by extrapolating the weights to the requested time
point, and querying the density from the basis functions with back-transformed
weights. Our approach aims for broad applicability by neither being restricted
to a specific parametric distribution, nor relying on cluster structure in the
data.It requires only two additional extrapolation-specific parameters, for
which reasonable defaults exist. Experimental evaluation on various data
streams, synthetic as well as from the real-world domains of credit scoring and
environmental health, shows that the model manages to capture monotonous drift
patterns accurately and better than existing methods. Thereby, it requires not
more than 1.5-times the run time of a corresponding static density estimation
approach.

waveforms to be much more accurate. This task would be facilitated if one has a
variety of cross-checks to \emph{evaluate} accuracy, particularly in the

errors are estimated by comparing the candidate waveforms with the numerical
relativity (NR) ones, which are taken to be exact. The goal of this paper is to

CIFAR-10 datasets show that such networks can approach the performance of
conventional Binarized Neural Networks. We evidence that the training procedure
should be adapted for use with stochastic computing. Finally, the ASIC
implementation of our scheme is investigated, in a system that closely
associates logic and memory, implemented by Spin Torque Magnetoresistive Random
Access Memory. This analysis shows that the stochastic computing approach can
allow considerable savings with regards to conventional Binarized Neural
networks in terms of area (62% area reduction on the Fashion-MNIST task). It
can also allow important savings in terms of energy consumption, if we accept
reasonable reduction of accuracy: for example a factor 2.1 can be saved, with
the cost of 1.4% in Fashion-MNIST test accuracy. These results highlight the

compact sets in the 1950s. In the 1980s Zakharyuta showed that for suitable $D$
and $K$ the asymptotics \begin{equation*}
  \lim_{m\to \infty}\frac{- \log d_m(\mathcal{A}_K^D)}{m^{1/n}} =
  2\pi \left ( \frac{n!}{C(K,D)}\right ) ^{1/n}\,, \end{equation*} where
$C(K,D)$ is the Bedford-Taylor relative capacity of $K$ in $D$ is implied by a
conjecture, now known as Zakharyuta's Conjecture, concerning the
approximability of the regularised relative extremal function of $K$ and $D$ by
certain pluricomplex Green functions. Zakharyuta's Conjecture was proved by
Nivoche in 2004 thus settling the asymptotics above at the same time.
  We shall give a new proof of the asymptotics above for $D$ strictly
hyperconvex and $K$ non-pluripolar which does not rely on Zakharyuta's
Conjecture. Instead we proceed more directly by a two-pronged approach
establishing sharp upper and lower bounds for the Kolmogorov widths. The lower
bounds follow from concentration results of independent interest for the
eigenvalues of a certain family of Toeplitz operators, while the upper bounds
follow from an application of the Bergman-Weil formula together with an
exhaustion procedure by special holomorphic polyhedra.

the classical mean-variance approach and portfolio allocation strategies such
as risk parity. It is based on a novel concept called portfolio dimensionality
that connects diversification to the non-Gaussianity of portfolio returns and
can typically be defined in terms of the ratio of risk measures which are
homogenous functions of equal degree. The latter arises naturally due to our
requirement that diversification measures should be leverage invariant. We
introduce this new framework and argue the benefits relative to existing
measures of diversification in the literature, before addressing the question
of optimizing diversification or, equivalently, dimensionality. Maximising
portfolio dimensionality leads to highly non-trivial optimization problems with
objective functions which are typically non-convex and potentially have
multiple local optima. Two complementary global optimization algorithms are
thus presented. For problems of moderate size and more akin to asset allocation
problems, a deterministic Branch and Bound algorithm is developed, whereas for
problems of larger size a stochastic global optimization algorithm based on
Gradient Langevin Dynamics is given. We demonstrate analytically and through
numerical experiments that the framework reflects the desired properties often
discussed in the literature.

real-valued quantity. However, in systems that possess orbital angular momentum
symmetry, the description of states with a well-defined, non-zero z-projection
of the orbital angular momentum requires a complex-valued 2-RDM. We consider a
semidefinite program suitable for the direct optimization of a complex-valued
2-RDM and explore the role of orbital angular momentum constraints in systems
that possess the relevant symmetries. For atomic systems, constraints on the
expectation values of the square and z-projection of the orbital angular
momentum operator allow one to optimize 2-RDMs for multiple orbital angular
momentum states. Similarly, in linear molecules, orbital angular momentum
projection constraints enable the description of multiple electronic states,
and, moreover, for states with a non-zero z-projection of the orbital angular
momentum, the use of complex-valued quantities is essential for a qualitatively
correct description of the electronic structure. For example, in the case of
molecular oxygen, we demonstrate that orbital angular momentum constraints are
necessary to recover the correct energy ordering of the lowest-energy singlet
and triplet states near the equilibrium geometry. However, care must still be
taken in the description of the dissociation limit, as the 2-RDM-based approach
is not size consistent, and the size-consistency error varies dramatically,
depending on the z-projections of the spin and orbital angular momenta.

invariant with respect to interactions (as opposed to a ""soft"" Luttinger's
theorem, where this invariance is lost). Despite it's simplicity, the
conditions on the fermionic self energy under which Luttinger's theorem is
valid remains a matter of debate, with possible requirements for its validity
ranging from particle-hole symmetry to analyticity about the Fermi surface. In

strength by invoking the Atiyah-Singer index theorem to quantify the

directly dependent on the existence of a (D-1)-dimensional manifold of gapless
chiral excitations at the Fermi level, regardless of whether the system

applications, for several reasons. First, we wanted to focus on architectural
challenges, and thus we choose to \textit{not} have to deal with programming
language difference between source and target system. We chose JEE
applications, in particular, because they embody the range of complexities that
one can encounter in recent legacy applications, namely, multi-language
systems, multi-tier applications, the reliance on external configuration files,
and the reliance on frameworks and container services during runtime. These
characteristics pose unique challenges for the three issues mentioned above.

properties of xylo- and deoxyxylo-nucleic acids (XyNA and dXyNA), which are
derived from their respective RNA and DNA analogues by an inversion of
configuration at a single chiral center in the sugar moiety of the nucleotide
unit. The free energy landscapes of an octameric XyNA sequence and its dXyNA
analogue demonstrate the existence of a facile conformational transition
between a left-handed helix that is the global free energy minimum, and a
closely competing ladder-type structure with approximately zero helicity. The
separation of the competing conformational ensembles is better-defined for the
dXyNA system, whereas the XyNA analogue is inherently more flexible. The former
therefore appear more suitable candidates for a molecular switch. The
landscapes differ qualitatively from those reported in previous studies for
evolved biomolecules: they are significantly more frustrated, so that XyNAs
provide an example of an unnatural system for which the conditions constituting
the principle of minimal frustration are, as may be expected, violated.

explicitly show this.
  One of fundamental, important and difficult studies on this field is,
constructing explicit fold maps and investigating their source manifolds. As
fundamental and strong tools for systematic construction, the author has
introduced surgery operations (bubbling operations) to fold maps, motivated by
studies of Kobayashi etc. since 1990. The author has explicitly shown that
homology groups of Reeb spaces of maps constructed by iterations of these
operations are generally flexible and restricted in several specific cases. The
Reeb space of a map is defined as the space of all connected components of
inverse images of the maps, inheriting fundamental invariants of manifolds such
as homology groups etc. in considerable cases and fundamental and important
tools in the field.
  In this paper, we explicitly remark on the torsion subgroups of the homology
groups. More precisely, under explicit algebraic constraints, we see explicit
strong restrictions on the torsion subgroups, where the homology groups seem to
be very flexible in general. We note that this work is similar to several works

quantify this violation in terms of the model parameters. We also make the same
calculation within a Color Glass Condensate scenario and show that the
dependence of the saturation scale on the number of participants generally
leads to violation of limiting fragmentation. We further argue that wounded
parton models, provided the nucleon size and parton density vary predominantly
with Bjorken $x$, could in principle reproduce both multiplicity dependence
with energy and limiting fragmentation. We suggest, therefore, that an
experimental measurement of deviation from limiting fragmentation in heavy ion
collisions, for different system sizes and including the experimentally
available range of energies, is a powerful test of initial state models.

current methods. Bootstrapping error is due to bootstrapping from actions that
lie outside of the training data distribution, and it accumulates via the
Bellman backup operator. We theoretically analyze bootstrapping error, and
demonstrate how carefully constraining action selection in the backup can
mitigate it. Based on our analysis, we propose a practical algorithm,
bootstrapping error accumulation reduction (BEAR). We demonstrate that BEAR is
able to learn robustly from different off-policy distributions, including

PTF10tpz, a barred spiral galaxy at z=0.03994. We find the CO(1-0) emission to
be confined within the bar of the galaxy. The distribution and kinematics of
molecular gas in the host galaxy resemble gas flows along two lanes running
from the tips of the bar towards the galaxy center. These gas lanes end in a
gaseous structure in the inner region of the galaxy, likely associated with an
inner Lindblad resonance. The interaction between the large-scale gas flows in
the bar and the gas in the inner region plausibly leads to the formation of
massive molecular clouds and consequently massive clusters. This in turn can
result in formation of massive stars, and thus the likely progenitor of the
SLSN in a young, massive cluster. This picture is consistent with SLSN PTF10tpz
being located near the inner structure. We find the molecular gas in the
vicinity of the SLSN to have high surface densities, comparable with those in
interacting galaxies or starburst regions in nearby galaxies. This lends
support to high densities being favorable conditions for formation of SLSNe

to enter long-lived metastable states where the monopole excitations form
so-called noncontractible pairs [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 107201 (2010)]. While
the nature of these states is well understood, the dynamical mechanisms
underpinning their formation remain largely unexplored and are the subject of
this study. We find that the long-range tail of the Coulomb interactions
between monopoles plays a central role by suppressing the monopole-assisted
decay of noncontractible pairs with respect to monopole-antimonopole
annihilation. In conjunction with low final quench temperatures, where the
system enters a nonhydrodynamic regime in which the monopoles effectively move
at terminal velocity in the direction of the local force acting on them, the
interactions lead to a metastable plateau that persists in the thermodynamic
limit. This is a remarkable phenomenon, reminiscent of jamming and some
instances of glassiness: A transient modification of the short-time dynamics of
the system allows it to enter a metastable state whose lifetime can easily be
astronomically large at (experimentally relevant) low temperatures. We
demonstrate this using Monte Carlo simulations and mean field population
dynamics theory, and we provide an analytical understanding of the mechanisms
at play. When the interactions between monopoles are truncated to finite range,
the metastable plateau reduces to a finite size effect. We derive the finite
size scaling behaviour of the density of noncontractible pairs in the
metastable plateau for both short- and long-range interactions, and discuss the
experimental implications of our results.

expansion (PRE) X-ray bursts from the ultracompact binary 4U 1820-30. NICER
observed the source in 2017 August accumulating about 60 ks of exposure. Five
thermonuclear X-ray bursts were detected of which four showed clear signs of
PRE. We extracted spectra during the PRE phases and fit each to a model that
includes a comptonized component to describe the accretion-driven emission, and
a black body for the burst thermal radiation. The temperature and spherical
emitting radius of the fitted black body are used to assess the strength of PRE
in each burst. The two strongest PRE bursts (burst pair 1) had black body
temperatures of approximately 0.6 keV and emitting radii of 100 km (at a
distance of 8.4 kpc). The other two bursts (burst pair 2) had higher
temperatures (~0.67 keV) and smaller radii (75 km). All of the PRE bursts show
evidence of narrow line emission near 1 keV. By co-adding the PRE phase spectra
of burst pairs 1 and, separately, 2 we find, in both co-added spectra,
significant, narrow, spectral features near 1.0 (emission), 1.7 and 3.0 keV
(both in absorption). Remarkably, all the fitted line centroids in the co-added
spectrum of burst pair 1 appear systematically blue-shifted by a factor of
$1.046 \pm 0.006$ compared to the centroids of pair 2, strongly indicative of a
gravitational red-shift, a wind-induced blue-shift, or more likely some
combination of both effects. The observed shifts are consistent with this
scenario in that the stronger PRE bursts in pair 1 reach larger photospheric
radii, and thus have weaker gravitational red-shifts, and they generate faster
outflows, yielding higher blue-shifts. We discuss possible elemental
identifications for the observed features in the context of recent burst-driven

weak lensing and predictions from abundance matching questions our
understanding of cosmology, or of the galaxy-halo connection, or of both. We
re-examined this tension by considering, as models, different cosmological
simulations in the Illustris suite. We produced excess profiles $R\Delta\Sigma$
from subhalo snapshots at different redshifts in Illustris-1 and IllustrisTNG
(TNG100 and TNG300) simulations, enabling a direct comparison with weak-lensing
measurements. We separate the individual contributions of stars, dark matter
and gas within $\approx1$ Mpc (comoving length), beyond which correlated
two-halo terms dominate. The mismatch between measurements and predictions is
more severe than in previous studies: $R\Delta\Sigma$ profiles from
IllustrisTNG are $\approx2$ times higher than the measured ones. Contrary to
abundance matching results, the mismatch is mostly unchanged with increasing
redshifts. The contribution of gas to the $R\Delta\Sigma$ profiles is $5-10\%$
over the scales dominated by one-halo terms. Different procedures to link
stellar and halo masses (abundance matching, cosmological simulations) are
still significantly discrepant with weak lensing measurements, but their trends
are different. Therefore, the change in cosmological parameters advocated
through abundance-matching arguments may not resolve this tension. Also,
current criteria to select isolated massive galaxies in simulations are
susceptible to resolution issues and may not correspond to observational
criteria. The (currently subdominant) contribution of gas is non-negligible,
and even if the major discrepancy within stellar and halo masses is resolved,
it will be an appreciable source of systematics in the LSST era, when
uncertainties on the $R\Delta\Sigma$ profiles are expected to be $\approx10$
times smaller.

relations between radius, gas temperature, density and pressure using a
combination of power-laws, also evaluating the intrinsic scatter in these

density, with very small scatter. Also, the temperature correlates with gas
density with similar scatter. The slopes of these relations have values that

transition occurs at the radius $r_t = 0.19(\pm0.04)R_{500}$ and electron
density $n_t = (1.91\pm0.21)\cdot10^{-3} cm^{-3} E^2 (z)$. We find that above
0.2 $R_{500}$ the radial thermodynamic profiles are accurately reproduced by a
well defined and physically motivated framework, where the dark matter follows
the NFW potential and the gas is represented by a polytropic equation of state.
By modeling the gas temperature dependence upon both the gas density and

Fourier transforms of the lightcurves show only one dominant frequency.
Phase-resolved spectroscopy for three objects reveals significant radial

consistent with large amplitude radial oscillations. The mean T$_{\rm eff}$ and
log(g) for these stars are consistent with hot subdwarf B (sdB) effective

dualities in 2+1 dimensions, which morally relate $U(N)_k$ and $SU(k)_{-N}$
Chern-Simons-matter theories. The advantage of these dualities is that regions
of the phase diagram which may be obscure on one side of the duality can be
accessed by condensing local operators on the other side. Starting from parent
Abelian states, we use this approach to construct Landau-Ginzburg theories of
non-Abelian states through a pairing mechanism. In particular, we obtain the
bosonic Read-Rezayi sequence at fillings $\nu=k/(kM+2)$ by starting from $k$
layers of bosons at $\nu=1/2$ with $M$ Abelian fluxes attached. The Read-Rezayi
states arise when $k$-clusters of the dual non-Abelian bosons condense. We
extend this construction by showing that $N_f$-component generalizations of the
Halperin $(2,2,1)$ bosonic states have dual descriptions in terms of
$SU(N_f+1)_1$ Chern-Simons-matter theories, revealing an emergent global
symmetry in the process. Clustering $k$ layers of these theories yields a

subtracting the emission due to such rotating disk, we detect with a S/N=20 a

a time comparable to the gravitational time-scale. We provide analytic
arguments and simulations in spherical approximation, that need to be validated
by more comprehensive simulations. The above result can be important for
fundamental physics, because core-collapse supernova explosions seem
anthropically needed, as they spread intermediate-mass nuclei presumably
necessary for `life'. We also study stellar burning, finding that it does not
provide anthropic boundaries on $v$.

$g_{tt}g_{rr}=-1$, as well as for having second-order linearized equations
around maximally symmetric backgrounds. In this paper we provide strong
evidence that any gravitational effective action involving higher-curvature
corrections is equivalent, via metric redefinitions, to some GQTG. In the case
of theories involving invariants constructed from contractions of the Riemann
tensor and the metric, we show this claim to be true as long as (at least) one
non-trivial GQTG invariant exists at each order in curvature ---and extremely
conclusive evidence suggests this is the case in general dimensions. When
covariant derivatives of the Riemann tensor are included, the evidence provided
is not as definitive, but we still prove the claim explicitly for all theories
including up to eight derivatives of the metric as well as for terms involving
arbitrary contractions of two covariant derivatives of the Riemann tensor and
any number of Riemann tensors. Our results suggest that the physics of generic
higher-curvature gravity black holes is captured by their GQTG counterparts,
dramatically easier to characterize and universal. As an example, we map the
gravity sector of the Type-IIB string theory effective action in AdS$_5$ at
order $\mathcal{O}({\alpha^{\prime}}^3)$ to a GQTG and show that the
thermodynamic properties of black holes in both frames match.

maximal entropy. Such a state can be described in terms of a state of closed,
interacting, fundamental strings in their high-temperature Hagedorn phase. The
entropy density in this state is equal to the square root of the energy density
in Planck units, while the pressure is positive and equal to the energy
density. These relations imply a maximally large entropy density and,
therefore, a state that cannot be described by a semiclassical spacetime
geometry. If one nevertheless insists on an effective semiclassical description
of this state, she can do so by ignoring the entropy. This leads to a partially
equivalent description in which the pressure appears to be negative and equal
in magnitude to the energy density, as if the energy-momentum tensor was that
of a cosmological constant. From this effective perspective, the state
describes a period of string-scale inflation. The bound state of strings
ultimately decays, possibly by a process akin to Hawking radiation, and
undergoes a transition into a phase of hot radiation. But, from the effective
perspective, the same decay corresponds to the heating of the Universe at the
end of inflation. Small quantum mechanical fluctuations in the initial state
lead to scale-invariant temperature anisotropies in the hot radiation. The
temperature anisotropies are interpreted in the effective description as
arising from quantum fluctuations of the curvature and an effective inflaton
field. The stringy microscopic description determines the parameters of the
model of inflation, as well as the cosmological observables, in terms of the
string length scale and coupling strength. Our framework is similar,
conceptually, to a recent description of black holes in terms of a maximal
entropy state of strings in the Hagedorn phase.

handle the short-distance sensitivity in perturbation theory. However, we show
that a small number of extra coefficients are sufficient to match numerical
simulations with percent accuracy when a generic renormalization prescription
is implemented (allowing for running of the individual counter-terms). We show
that the level of accuracy increases with respect to the two loop results, up
to $k \simeq 0.4\, h$Mpc$^{-1}$ at redshift $z=0$, although the overall
improvement is somewhat marginal. At the same time, we argue there is evidence
that the behavior of the loop expansion in the EFTofLSS is typical of an
asymptotic series, already on the brink of its maximum predictive power (at
$z=0$). Hence, the inclusion of higher orders will likely deteriorate the
matching to data, even at moderate values of $k$. Part of the reason for this
behavior is due to large contributions to the (renormalized) power spectrum at
three loop order from mildly non-linear scales, even after the UV counter-terms
are included. In conclusion, the EFTofLSS to three loop orders provides the
best approximation to the (deterministic part of the) power spectrum in the
weakly non-linear regime at $z=0$, and higher loops are not expected to improve
our level of accuracy.

task for many applications such as surveillance, robotics, and human-computer
interaction. To understand subtle and precise actions within a long time
period, second-order information (e.g. feature covariance) or higher is
reported to be effective in the literature. However, extracting such high-order
information is considerably non-trivial. In particular, the dimensionality
increases exponentially with the information order, and hence gaining more
representation power also increases the computational cost and the risk of
overfitting. In this paper, we propose an approach to representing high-order
information for temporal action segmentation via a simple yet effective
bilinear form. Specifically, our contributions are: (1) From the multilinear
perspective, we derive a bilinear form of low complexity, assuming that the
three-way tensor has low-rank frontal slices. (2) Rather than learning the
tensor entries from data, we sample the entries from different underlying
distributions, and prove that the underlying distribution influences the
information order. (3) We employed our bilinear form as an intermediate layer
in state-of-the-art deep neural networks, enabling to represent high-order
information in complex deep models effectively and efficiently. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed bilinear form outperforms
the previous state-of-the-art methods on the challenging temporal action
segmentation task. One can see our project page for data, model and code:

both difficult to know a priori how successful a GRU network will perform on a

biological counterparts. Using a continuous time analysis, we gain intuition on
the inner workings of GRU networks. We restrict our presentation to low
dimensions, allowing for a comprehensive visualization. We found a surprisingly
rich repertoire of dynamical features that includes stable limit cycles
(nonlinear oscillations), multi-stable dynamics with various topologies, and
homoclinic bifurcations. At the same time we were unable to train GRU networks
to produce continuous attractors, which are hypothesized to exist in biological

Mallows model defined by Fligner and Verducci 1986. Despite the significant
research interest of ranking distributions, the exact sample complexity of
estimating the parameters of a Mallows and a Generalized Mallows Model is not
well-understood. The main result of the paper is a tight sample complexity

learning problem by analyzing a more general model which interpolates between
the single parameter Mallows Model and the $m$ parameter Mallows model. We call
our model Mallows Block Model -- referring to the Block Models that are a
popular model in theoretical statistics. Our sample complexity analysis gives
tight bound for learning the Mallows Block Model for any number of blocks. We
provide essentially matching lower bounds for our sample complexity results. As
a corollary of our analysis, it turns out that, if the central ranking is
known, one single sample from the Mallows Block Model is sufficient to estimate
the spread parameters with error that goes to zero as the size of the

CO-dark gas is found in regions with local visual extinctions $A_\text{V, 3D}
\sim$ 0.2 - 1.5, number densities of 10 - 10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$ and gas
temperatures of few 10 K - 100 K. CO-bright gas is found at number densities
above 300 cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures below 50 K. The CO-dark gas fractions
range from 40% to 95% and scale inversely with the amount of well-shielded gas
($A_\text{V, 3D}$ $\gtrsim$ 1.5), which is smaller in magnetised molecular
clouds. We show that the density, chemical abundances and $A_\text{V, 3D}$

quantities. As an example, pixels with a projected visual extinction of
$A_\text{V, 2D} \simeq$ 2.5 - 5 can be both, CO-bright or CO-dark, which can be
attributed to the presence or absence of strong density enhancements along the
line-of-sight. By producing synthetic CO(1-0) emission maps of the simulations
with RADMC-3D, we show that about 15 - 65\% of the H$_2$ is in regions with
intensities below the detection limit. Our clouds have $X_\text{CO}$-factors

up to a factor $\sim$ 4, implying a similar uncertainty in the derived total
H$_2$ masses and even worse for individual pixels. Based on our results, we
suggest a new approach to determine the H$_2$ mass, which relies on the
availability of CO(1-0) emission and $A_\text{V, 2D}$ maps. It reduces the
uncertainty of the clouds' overall H$_2$ mass to a factor of $\lesssim$ 1.8 and
for individual pixels, i.e. on sub-pc scales, to a factor of $\lesssim$ 3.

Collating these data makes it possible to understand the origin of these

the study of emission profiles in the associated reflection nebulae allows us
to consider the source of the outflow both from edge-on and pole-on points of
view. We present the observational results obtained with the 6 m telescope at

the SCORPIO multimode focal reducer with a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer.
Two epochs of the observations of the FS~Tau~B region in H$\alpha$ emission
(2001 and 2012) allowed us to measure the PM of the spectrally separated inner
structures of the jet. In addition to already known emission structures in the
FS~Tau~B system, we discover new features in the extended part of the jet and
in the counter-jet. Moreover, we reveal a new HH knot in the HH~276 independent
outflow system and point out its presumable source. In the terminal working
surface of the jet, structures with different radial velocities have PMs of the
same value. This result can be interpreted as the direct observation of
bow-shock and Mach disk regions. A bar-like structure, located southwest from
the source demonstrates zero PM and can be considered as one more example of
deflection shock. An analysis of H$\alpha$ profiles in the reflection nebulae

underlying memory representation, such as bit-flips that may be induced by
hardware fault attacks. We study the effects of bitwise corruptions on 19 DNN
models---six architectures on three image classification tasks---and we show
that most models have at least one parameter that, after a specific bit-flip in
their bitwise representation, causes an accuracy loss of over 90%. We employ
simple heuristics to efficiently identify the parameters likely to be
vulnerable. We estimate that 40-50% of the parameters in a model might lead to
an accuracy drop greater than 10% when individually subjected to such
single-bit perturbations. To demonstrate how an adversary could take advantage
of this vulnerability, we study the impact of an exemplary hardware fault
attack, Rowhammer, on DNNs. Specifically, we show that a Rowhammer enabled
attacker co-located in the same physical machine can inflict significant
accuracy drops (up to 99%) even with single bit-flip corruptions and no

measurement of the shapes and redshifts of background galaxies and requires
precise control of systematic errors. The Monte Carlo Control Loops (MCCL) is a
forward modelling method designed to tackle this problem. It relies on the
Ultra Fast Image Generator (UFig) to produce simulated images tuned to match
the target data statistically, followed by calibrations and tolerance loops. We
present the first end-to-end application of this method, on the Dark Energy
Survey (DES) Year 1 wide field imaging data. We simultaneously measure the
shear power spectrum $C_{\ell}$ and the redshift distribution $n(z)$ of the
background galaxy sample. The method includes maps of the systematic sources,
Point Spread Function (PSF), an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)
inference of the simulation model parameters, a shear calibration scheme, and
the fast estimation of the covariance matrix. We find a close statistical
agreement between the simulations and the DES Y1 data using an array of
diagnostics. In a non-tomographic setting, we derive a set of $C_\ell$ and
$n(z)$ curves that encode the cosmic shear measurement, as well as the
systematic uncertainty. Following a blinding scheme, we measure the combination
of $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and intrinsic alignment amplitude $A_{\rm{IA}}$,
defined as $S_8D_{\rm{IA}} = \sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}D_{\rm{IA}}$, where
$D_{\rm{IA}}=1-0.11(A_{\rm{IA}}-1)$. We find
$S_8D_{\rm{IA}}=0.895^{+0.054}_{-0.039}$, where systematics are at the level of
roughly 60\% of the statistical errors. We discuss these results in the context
of earlier cosmic shear analyses of the DES Y1 data. Our findings indicate that
this method and its fast runtime offer good prospects for cosmic shear
measurements with future wide-field surveys.

consider the case where nodes have different selection costs and provide bounds

sensor placement where the cost of placing sensors depends on the location of
the placement. We also elucidate that the empirical convergence of our proposed

pricing puzzle. Fortune (2000) noted that the margin loan interest rates
charged by stock brokers are very high in relation to the actual (low) credit
risk and the cost of funds. If we live in the Black-Scholes world, the brokers
are presumably making arbitrage profits by shorting dynamically precise amounts
of their clients' portfolios. First, we extend Fortune's (2000) application of
Merton's (1974) no-arbitrage approach to allow for brokers that can only revise
their hedges finitely many times during the term of the loan. We show that
extremely small differences in the revision frequency can easily explain the
observed variation in margin loan pricing. In fact, four additional revisions
per three-day period serve to explain all of the currently observed
heterogeneity. Second, we study monopolistic (or oligopolistic) margin loan
pricing by brokers whose clients are continuous-time Kelly gamblers. The broker
solves a general stochastic control problem that yields simple and pleasant
formulas for the optimal interest rate and the net interest margin. If the
author owned a brokerage, he would charge an interest rate of
$(r+\nu)/2-\sigma^2/4$, where $r$ is the cost of funds, $\nu$ is the

last decade. But with the increasing demand for large scale data, the need of
hand annotated data for the training becomes more and more impractical. One way
to avoid frame-based human annotation is the use of action order information to
learn the respective action classes. In this context, we propose a hierarchical
approach to address the problem of weakly supervised learning of human actions
from ordered action labels by structuring recognition in a coarse-to-fine
manner. Given a set of videos and an ordered list of the occurring actions, the
task is to infer start and end frames of the related action classes within the
video and to train the respective action classifiers without any need for hand
labeled frame boundaries. We address this problem by combining a framewise RNN
model with a coarse probabilistic inference. This combination allows for the
temporal alignment of long sequences and thus, for an iterative training of
both elements. While this system alone already generates good results, we show
that the performance can be further improved by approximating the number of
subactions to the characteristics of the different action classes as well as by
the introduction of a regularizing length prior. The proposed system is
evaluated on two benchmark datasets, the Breakfast and the Hollywood extended
dataset, showing a competitive performance on various weak learning tasks such
as temporal action segmentation and action alignment.

globally for neural networks on perception tasks. Most previous works on neural
network verification for perception tasks focus on robustness verification.
Unlike robustness verification, which aims to verify that the prediction of a
network is stable in some local regions around labelled points, our framework
provides a way to specify correctness globally in the whole target input space
and verify that the network is correct for all target inputs (or find the
regions where the network is not correct). We provide a specification through
1) a state space consisting of all relevant states of the world and 2) an
observation process that produces neural network inputs from the states of the
world. Tiling the state and input spaces with a finite number of tiles,
obtaining ground truth bounds from the state tiles and network output bounds
from the input tiles, then comparing the ground truth and network output bounds
delivers an upper bound on the network output error for any inputs of interest.
The presented framework also enables detecting illegal inputs -- inputs that
are not contained in (or close to) the target input space as defined by the
state space and observation process (the neural network is not designed to work
on them), so that we can flag when we don't have guarantees. Results from two
case studies highlight the ability of our technique to verify error bounds over
the whole target input space and show how the error bounds vary over the state
and input spaces.

qualitative description of a possible mechanism (termed the Mechanism) covering
the main stages of lightning initiation, starting before and including the
initiating event, followed by the initial electric field change (IEC), followed
by the first few initial breakdown pulses (IBPs). The Mechanism assumes
initiation occurs in a region of ~1 km3 with average electric field E>0.3 MV/(m
atm), which contains, because of turbulence, numerous small 'Eth-volumes' of
10^-4-10^-3 m3 with E>3 MV/(m atm). The Mechanism allows for lightning
initiation by either of two observed types of events: a high power VHF event
such as a Narrow Bipolar Event, or a weak VHF event. According to the
Mechanism, both types of initiating events are caused by a group of
relativistic runaway electron avalanche particles (where the initial electrons
are secondary particles of an extensive air shower) passing through many
Eth-volumes, thereby causing the nearly simultaneous launching of many positive
streamer flashes. Due to ionization-heating instability, unusual plasma
formations (UPFs) appear along the streamers' trajectories of the streamers.
These UPFs combine into three-dimensional (3D) networks of hot plasma channels
during the IEC, resulting in its observed weak current flow. The subsequent
development and combination of two (or more) of these 3D networks of hot plasma
channels then causes the first IBP. Each subsequent IBP is caused when another
3D network of hot plasma channels combines with the chain of networks caused by
earlier IBPs.

different morphologies are obtained, including the regular double emulsions,
decussate regimes with one or two alternate empty droplets, and structures with
multiple inner droplets contained in the continuous middle phase thread.
Bidisperse behaviors are also frequently encountered in the two-step formation

tension ratio can greatly change the morphologies of the obtained emulsion

side inlets or the distance between the two side inlets promotes the conversion
from the two-step formation regime to the one-step formation regime.

show that fixation probability under weak selection can be calculated in terms
of the coalescence times of random walks. This result leads naturally to a new
definition of effective population size. Using this and other methods, we
uncover the first known examples of transient amplifiers of selection (graphs

organized and functional computational device. Artificial neural networks,
however, rely on human-designed, hand-programmed architectures for their
remarkable performance. Can we develop artificial computational devices that
can grow and self-organize without human intervention? In this paper, we
propose a biologically inspired developmental algorithm that can 'grow' a
functional, layered neural network from a single initial cell. The algorithm
organizes inter-layer connections to construct a convolutional pooling layer, a
key constituent of convolutional neural networks (CNN's). Our approach is
inspired by the mechanisms employed by the early visual system to wire the
retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), days before animals open their
eyes. The key ingredients for robust self-organization are an emergent
spontaneous spatiotemporal activity wave in the first layer and a local
learning rule in the second layer that 'learns' the underlying activity pattern
in the first layer. The algorithm is adaptable to a wide-range of input-layer
geometries, robust to malfunctioning units in the first layer, and so can be
used to successfully grow and self-organize pooling architectures of different
pool-sizes and shapes. The algorithm provides a primitive procedure for
constructing layered neural networks through growth and self-organization.
Broadly, our work shows that biologically inspired developmental algorithms can
be applied to autonomously grow functional 'brains' in-silico.

phenomenon by which adding a carefully chosen video clip to the audio channel
affects the viewer's perception of what is said (McGurk and MacDonald, 1976).
We obtain empirical estimates that a significant fraction of both words and

We prove that a universal gate set for quantum computing cannot be realised by
supplementing locality-preserving logical operators with defect braiding, even
in more than two dimensions. However, notwithstanding this no-go theorem, we
demonstrate that higher dimensional defect-braiding schemes have the potential
to play an important role in realising fault-tolerant quantum computing.
Specifically, we present an approach to implement the full Clifford group via
braiding in any code possessing twist defects on which a fermion can condense.
We explore three such examples in higher dimensional codes, specifically: in
self-dual surface codes; the three dimensional Levin-Wen fermion mode; and the
checkerboard model. Finally, we show how our no-go theorems can be circumvented
to provide a universal scheme in three-dimensional surface codes without magic

logical operators conditional on logical measurement outcomes to lift a
combination of locality-preserving and braiding logical operators to
universality.

extract the low-energy information of quantum systems. The adiabatic projection
method, which is based on Euclidean time projection, is a procedure for
studying scattering and reactions on the lattice. The method constructs the
adiabatic Hamiltonian that gives the low-lying energies and wave functions of
two-cluster systems. In this paper we seek the answer to the question whether
an adiabatic Hamiltonian constructed in a smaller subspace of the two-cluster
state space can still provide information on the low-lying spectrum and the
corresponding wave functions. We present the results from our investigations on
constructing the adiabatic Hamiltonian using Euclidean time projection and
extracting details of the low-energy spectrum and wave functions by
diagonalizing it. In our analyses we consider systems of fermion-fermion and
fermion-dimer interacting via a zero-range attractive potential in one

in three dimensions. The results presented here provide a guide for improving
the adiabatic projection method and for reducing the computational costs of

  Analysis and Gaussian Process","16 pages, 11 Figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Segmentation of overlapping convex objects has various applications, for
example, in nanoparticles and cell imaging. Often the segmentation method has
to rely purely on edges between the background and foreground making the
analyzed images essentially silhouette images. Therefore, to segment the
objects, the method needs to be able to resolve the overlaps between multiple
objects by utilizing prior information about the shape of the objects. This
paper introduces a novel method for segmentation of clustered partially
overlapping convex objects in silhouette images. The proposed method involves
three main steps: pre-processing, contour evidence extraction, and contour
estimation. Contour evidence extraction starts by recovering contour segments
from a binarized image by detecting concave points. After this, the contour
segments which belong to the same objects are grouped. The grouping is
formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem and solved using the branch
and bound algorithm. Finally, the full contours of the objects are estimated by
a Gaussian process regression method. The experiments on a challenging dataset
consisting of nanoparticles demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
three current state-of-art approaches in overlapping convex objects
segmentation. The method relies only on edge information and can be applied to
any segmentation problems where the objects are partially overlapping and have
a convex shape.

applications built on top of it, i.e., the extraction of maximal multilayer
cores only, densest subgraph in multilayer networks, the speed-up of the
extraction of frequent cross-graph quasi-cliques, and the generalization of
community search to the multilayer setting. Then, we introduce the concept of
core decomposition in temporal networks; also in this case, we are interested
in the extraction of maximal temporal cores only. Finally, in the context of
discovering polarization in large-scale online data, we study the problem of
identifying polarized communities in signed networks. The proposed
methodologies are evaluated on a large variety of real-world networks against

type $\Xi_t^i\in \{1,\cdots,n\}$. While $X_t^i$ is a standard (independent)
diffusion process, the evolution of the type $\Xi_t^i$ is described by pairwise
interactions between different particles under a series of chemical reactions
described by a chemical reaction network. We prove that in the large particle
limit the stochastic dynamics converges to a mean field limit which is
described by a nonlocal reaction-diffusion partial differential equation. In
particular, we obtain a quantitative propagation of chaos result for the
interacting particle system. Our proof is based on the relative entropy method

shown the advantages of penalization methods in detecting G$\times$E

structural identification by distinguishing nonlinear interactions from

incorporated on both individual and group levels to identify the sparse main

selection more efficiently than existing methods. Simulation shows that the
proposed model outperforms competing alternatives in terms of both

identification of main and interaction effects with important implications in a

various networks including, in particular, brain networks. Motivated by data
from human brain functional networks, in this technical note, we analytically
show that partial synchronization can be induced by strong regional connections
in coupled subnetworks of Kuramoto oscillators. To quantify the required
strength of regional connections, we first obtain a critical value for the
algebraic connectivity of the corresponding subnetwork using the incremental 2
norm. We then introduce the concept of the generalized complement graph, and
obtain another condition on the weighted nodal degree by using the incremental
infinity norm. Under these two conditions, regions of attraction for partial
phase cohesiveness are estimated in the forms of the incremental 2 and infinity
norms, respectively. Our result based on the incremental infinity norm is the
first known criterion that is applicable to non-complete graphs. Numerical
simulations are performed on a two-level network to illustrate our theoretical
results; more importantly, we use real anatomical brain network data to show
how our results may reveal the interplay between anatomical structure and
empirical patterns of synchrony.

control and detection via magnetic resonance is widely exploited, e.g. in
chemistry, medicine, materials science and mining. Nuclear spins also featured
in early ideas and demonstrations of quantum information processing. Scaling up
these ideas requires controlling individual nuclei, which can be detected when
coupled to an electron. However, the need to address the nuclei via oscillating
magnetic fields complicates their integration in multi-spin nanoscale devices,
because the field cannot be localized or screened. Control via electric fields
would resolve this problem, but previous methods relied upon transducing
electric signals into magnetic fields via the electron-nuclear hyperfine
interaction, which severely affects the nuclear coherence. Here we demonstrate
the coherent quantum control of a single antimony (spin-7/2) nucleus, using
localized electric fields produced within a silicon nanoelectronic device. The
method exploits an idea first proposed in 1961 but never realized
experimentally with a single nucleus. Our results are quantitatively supported
by a microscopic theoretical model that reveals how the purely electrical
modulation of the nuclear electric quadrupole interaction, in the presence of
lattice strain, results in coherent nuclear spin transitions. The spin
dephasing time, 0.1 seconds, surpasses by orders of magnitude those obtained
via methods that require a coupled electron spin for electrical drive. These
results show that high-spin quadrupolar nuclei could be deployed as chaotic
models, strain sensors and hybrid spin-mechanical quantum systems using
all-electrical controls. Integrating electrically controllable nuclei with
quantum dots could pave the way to scalable nuclear- and electron-spin-based
quantum computers in silicon that operate without the need for oscillating

  Shift",,,"10.1109/TSP.2020.2988784",,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Matrix completion algorithms fill missing entries in a large matrix given a
subset of observed samples. However, how to best pre-select informative matrix
entries given a sampling budget is largely unaddressed. In this paper, we
propose a fast sample selection strategy for matrix completion from a graph
signal processing perspective. Specifically, we first regularize the matrix
reconstruction objective using a dual graph signal smoothness prior, resulting
in a system of linear equations for solution. We then select appropriate
samples to maximize the smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\min}$ of the coefficient
matrix, thus maximizing the stability of the linear system. To efficiently
solve this combinatorial problem, we derive a greedy sampling strategy,
leveraging on Gershgorin circle theorem, that iteratively selects one sample
(equivalent to shifting one Gershgorin disc) at a time corresponding to the
largest magnitude entry in the first eigenvector of a modified graph Laplacian
matrix. Our algorithm benefits computationally from warm start as the first
eigenvectors of incremented Laplacian matrices are computed recurrently for
more samples. To achieve computation scalability when sampling large matrices,
we further rewrite the coefficient matrix as a sum of two separate components,
each of which exhibits block-diagonal structure that we exploit for alternating
block-wise sampling. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world

amount of noise that degrades the positioning accuracy dramatically especially
in real-time applications. In this work, we consider a data-mining approach to
enhance the GPS signal. We build a large-scale high precision GPS receiver grid
system to collect real-time GPS signals for training. The Gaussian Process (GP)
regression is chosen to model the vertical Total Electron Content (vTEC)
distribution of the ionosphere of the Earth. Our experiments show that the
noise in the real-time GPS signals often exceeds the breakdown point of the
conventional robust regression methods resulting in sub-optimal system
performance. We propose a three-step approach to address this challenge. In the
first step we perform a set of signal validity tests to separate the signals
into clean and dirty groups. In the second step, we train an initial model on
the clean signals and then reweigting the dirty signals based on the residual
error. A final model is retrained on both the clean signals and the reweighted
dirty signals. In the theoretical analysis, we prove that the proposed
three-step approach is able to tolerate much higher noise level than the
vanilla robust regression methods if two reweighting rules are followed. We
validate the superiority of the proposed method in our real-time high precision
positioning system against several popular state-of-the-art robust regression
methods. Our method achieves centimeter positioning accuracy in the benchmark
region with probability $78.4\%$ , outperforming the second best baseline

lines, interpretation of solar chromospheric observations is difficult. The
origin and characteristics of many chromospheric features are, because of this,
unresolved. We focus here on studying two prominent features: long fibrils and
flare ribbons. To model them, we use a 3D MHD simulation of an active region
which self-consistently reproduces both of them. We model the H$\alpha$, Mg II
k, Ca II K, and Ca II 8542 {\AA} lines using the 3D non-LTE radiative transfer
code Multi3D.
  This simulation reproduces long fibrils that span between the
opposite-polarity sunspots and go up to 4 Mm in height. They can be traced in
all lines due to density corrugation. Opposite to previous studies, H$\alpha$,
Mg II h&k, and Ca II H&K, are formed at similar height in this model. Magnetic
field lines are aligned with the H$\alpha$ fibrils, but the latter holds to a
lesser extent for the Ca II 8542 {\AA} line.
  The simulation shows structures in the H$\alpha$ line core that look like
flare ribbons. The emission in the ribbons is caused by a dense chromosphere
and a transition region at high column mass. The ribbons are visible in all
chromospheric lines, but least prominent in Ca II 8542 {\AA} line. In some
pixels, broad asymmetric profiles with a single emission peak are produced,
similar to the profiles observed in flare ribbons. They are caused by a deep
onset of the chromospheric temperature rise and large velocity gradients.
  The simulation produces long fibrils similar to what is seen in observations.
It also produces structures similar to flare ribbons despite the lack of
non-thermal electrons in the simulation. The latter suggests that thermal
conduction might be a significant agent in transporting flare energy to the
chromosphere in addition to non-thermal electrons.

interactions of pairs of individuals when the responses to items represent the
actions (or behaviors, perceptions, etc.) of each individual (actor) made
within the context of a dyad formed with another individual (partner). Examples
of its use include the assessment of collaborative problem solving, or the
evaluation of intra-team dynamics. The dIRT model generalizes both Item
Response Theory (IRT) models for measurement and the Social Relations Model
(SRM) for dyadic data. The responses of an actor when paired with a partner are
modeled as a function of not only the actor's inclination to act and the
partner's tendency to elicit that action, but also the unique relationship of
the pair, represented by two directional, possibly correlated, interaction
latent variables. Generalizations are discussed, such as accommodating triads
or larger groups. Estimation is performed using Markov-chain Monte Carlo
implemented in Stan, making it straightforward to extend the dIRT model in
various ways. Specifically, we show how the basic dIRT model can be extended to
accommodate latent regressions, multilevel settings with cluster-level random
effects, as well as joint modeling of dyadic data and a distal outcome. A
simulation study demonstrates that estimation performs well. We apply our
proposed approach to speed-dating data and find new evidence of pairwise
interactions between participants, describing a mutual attraction that is
inadequately characterized by individual properties alone.

an eventually periodic sequence of 2-dimensional morphisms. We prove that it is
the same as the substitutive structure of the minimal subshift $X_0$ of the
Jeandel-Rao Wang shift computed in an earlier work by the author. As a
consequence, $\mathcal{P}_0$ is a Markov partition for the associated toral
$\mathbb{Z}^2$-rotation $R_0$. It also implies that the subshift $X_0$ is
uniquely ergodic and is isomorphic to the toral $\mathbb{Z}^2$-rotation $R_0$

announced. One of these pulsates with periods around 4.7 min, making it the
shortest period roAp star known to date. Four out of the five new roAp stars
are multiperiodic. Three of these, and the singly-periodic one show the
presence of rotational mode splitting. Individual frequencies are provided in

Additional modes of oscillation are found in some stars, while in others we are

ground-based data. We find that the pulsation amplitude in the TESS filter is
typically a factor 6 smaller than that in the $B$ filter which is usually used

inclination angle and magnetic obliquity, through the application of the
oblique pulsator model. We also confirm the absence of roAp-type pulsations
down to amplitude limits of 6 and 13 micromag, respectively, in two of the best

favorable for its own survival. Most planets experience numerous perturbations
throughout their lifetimes such as asteroid impacts, volcanism, and the
evolution of their host star's luminosity. For the Gaia hypothesis to be
viable, life must be able to keep the conditions of its host planet habitable,
even in the face of these challenges. ExoGaia, a model created to investigate
the Gaia hypothesis, has been previously used to demonstrate that a randomly
mutating biosphere is in some cases capable of maintaining planetary
habitability. However, those model scenarios assumed that all non-biological
planetary parameters were static, neglecting the inevitable perturbations that
real planets would experience. To see how life responds to climate
perturbations to its host planet, we created three climate perturbations in
ExoGaia: one rapid cooling of a planet and two heating events, one rapid and
one gradual. The planets on which Gaian feedbacks emerge without climate
perturbations are the same planets on which life is most likely to survive each
of our perturbation scenarios. Biospheres experiencing gradual changes to the
environment are able to survive changes of larger magnitude than those
experiencing rapid perturbations, and the magnitude of change matters more than
the sign. These findings suggest that if the Gaia hypothesis is correct, then
typical perturbations that a planet would experience may be unlikely to disrupt
Gaian systems.

structural balance, or to reflect hierarchies. We propose a model where agents
adjust their connections to appear credible to an external observer. In
particular, we envision a signed, directed network where positive edges
represent endorsements or trust and negative edges represent accusations or
doubt, and consider both the strategies an external observer might use to
identify credible nodes and the strategies nodes might use to then appear
credible by changing their outgoing edges. First, we establish that an external
observer may be able to exactly identify a set of 'honest' nodes from an
adversarial set of 'cheater' nodes regardless of the 'cheater' nodes'
connections. However, while these results show that an external observer's task
is not hopeless, some of these theorems involve network structures that are
NP-hard to find. Instead, we suggest a simple heuristic that an external
observer might use to identify which nodes are not credible based upon their
involvement with particular implicating edge motifs. Building on these notions,
and analogously to some models of structural balance, we develop a discrete
time dynamical system where nodes engage in implication avoiding dynamics,
where inconsistent arrangements of edges that cause a node to look 'suspicious'
exert pressure for that node to change edges. We demonstrate that these
dynamics provide a new way to understand group fracture when nodes are worried
about appearing consistent to an external observer.

access to examples of all object classes that are desired to be recognized

flexibility to adapt to new learning tasks. In practical settings, learning
tasks often arrive in a sequence and the models must continually learn to
increment their previously acquired knowledge. Existing incremental learning
approaches fall well below the state-of-the-art cumulative models that use all
training classes at once. In this paper, we propose a random path selection
algorithm, called Adaptive RPS-Net, that progressively chooses optimal paths
for the new tasks while encouraging parameter sharing between tasks. We
introduce a new network capacity measure that enables us to automatically
switch paths if the already used resources are saturated. Since the proposed
path-reuse strategy ensures forward knowledge transfer, our approach is
efficient and has considerably less computation overhead. As an added novelty,
the proposed model integrates knowledge distillation and retrospection along
with the path selection strategy to overcome catastrophic forgetting. In order
to maintain an equilibrium between previous and newly acquired knowledge, we
propose a simple controller to dynamically balance the model plasticity.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the Adaptive RPS-Net method
surpasses the state-of-the-art performance for incremental learning and by
utilizing parallel computation this method can run in constant time with nearly
the same efficiency as a conventional deep convolutional neural network.

it has been suggested that braiding operations may be performed which act as
logic operations, suitable for quantum computation. However, the unavoidable
misalignment of the magnetic field in any realistic device geometry has raised
questions about the feasibility of such braiding. In this paper, we numerically
simulate braiding operations in devices with Y-junction and tuning fork
geometries using an experimentally motivated nanowire model. We study how the
static and dynamical features vary with geometric parameters and identify
parameter choices that optimise the probability of a successful braid. Notably,
we find that there is an optimal Y-junction half-angle (about 20 degrees for
our parameter values), which balances two competing mechanisms that reduce the
energy gap to excitations. In addition, we find that a tuning fork geometry has
significant advantages over a Y-junction geometry, as it substantially reduces
the effect of dynamical phase oscillations that complicate the braiding
process. Our results suggest that performing a successful braid is in principle
possible with such devices, and lies within experimental reach.

progressively complicated. The typical trend in designing data structures in
scientific applications are basically nested data structures: pointing to a
data structure within another one. Managing nested data structures on a modern
heterogeneous system requires tremendous effort due to the separate memory
space design.
  In this paper, we will discuss the implications of deep copy on data
transfers on current heterogeneous. Then, we will discuss the two options that
are currently available to perform the memory copy operations on complex

examine the efficiency of upcoming approaches that address the challenge of

parameters (e.g. permeability) subsurface flow simulations. The mathematics
behind is to solve a dynamic constrained optimization problem. Traditional
methods like finite difference and forward sensitivity analysis require
computational cost that increases linearly with the number of parameters times
number of cost functions. Discrete adjoint sensitivity analysis (SA) is gaining
popularity due to its computational efficiency. This algorithm requires a
forward run followed by a backward run who involves integrating adjoint
equation backward in time. This was done by doing one forward solve and store
the snapshot by checkpointing. Using the checkpoint data, the adjoint equation
is numerically integrated. The computational cost of this algorithm only
depends on the number of cost functions and does not depend on the number of
parameters. The algorithm is highly powerful when the parameter space is large,
and in our case of heterogeneous permeability the number of parameters is
proportional to the number of grid cells. The aim of this project is to
implement the discrete sensitivity analysis method in parallel to solve
realistic subsurface problems. To achieve this goal, we propose to implement
the algorithm in parallel using data structures such as TSAdjoint and TAO. This
paper dealt with large-scale subsurface flow inversion problem with discrete
adjoint method. This method can effectively reduce the computational cost in

imposes style uniformly on all parts of the content image, which perturbs
central objects on the content image, such as faces or text, and makes them
unrecognizable. This work proposes a novel style transfer algorithm which
automatically detects central objects on the content image, generates spatial
importance mask and imposes style non-uniformly: central objects are stylized
less to preserve their recognizability and other parts of the image are
stylized as usual to preserve the style. Three methods of automatic central

that replicates the properties of the BOSS CMASS sample. The CMASS galaxy
sample has been well characterized by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
collaboration and was used to obtain the most powerful redshift-space galaxy
clustering measurements to date. A joint analysis of redshift-space distortions
(such as those probed by CMASS from SDSS) and a galaxy-galaxy lensing
measurement for an equivalent sample from DES can provide powerful cosmological
constraints. Unfortunately, the DES and SDSS-BOSS footprints have only minimal
overlap, primarily on the celestial equator near the SDSS Stripe 82 region.
Using this overlap, we build a robust Bayesian model to select CMASS-like
galaxies in the remainder of the DES footprint. The newly defined DES-CMASS
(DMASS) sample consists of 117,293 effective galaxies covering $1,244 {\rm
deg}^2$. Through various validation tests, we show that the DMASS sample
selected by this model matches well with the BOSS CMASS sample, specifically in
the South Galactic cap (SGC) region that includes Stripe 82. Combining
measurements of the angular correlation function and the clustering-z
distribution of DMASS, we constrain the difference in mean galaxy bias and mean
redshift between the BOSS CMASS and DMASS samples to be $\Delta b =
0.010^{+0.045}_{-0.052}$ and $\Delta z = \left( 3.46^{+5.48}_{-5.55} \right)

0.044^{+0.044}_{-0.043} $ and $\Delta z= ( 3.51^{+4.93}_{-5.91}) \times
10^{-3}$ for the full CMASS sample. These values indicate that the mean bias of
galaxies and mean redshift in the DMASS sample is consistent with both CMASS
samples within $1\sigma$.

fuel particles in oxidizer is studied analytically and numerically. Two types
of models are considered: First, a continuum model, wherein the individual
particulate sources are not resolved and the heat release is assumed spatially
uniform, is solved via conventional finite difference techniques. Second, a
discrete source model, wherein the heat diffusion from individual sources is
modeled via superposition of the Green's function of each source, is employed
to examine the influence of the random, discrete nature of the media. Heat
transfer to cold, isothermal walls and to a layer of inert gas surrounding the
reactive medium are considered as the loss mechanisms. Both cylindrical and
rectangular (slab) geometries of the reactive medium are considered, and the
flame speed is measured as a function of the diameter and thickness of the
domains, respectively. In the continuum model with inert gas confinement, a
universal scaling of critical diameter to critical thickness near 2:1 is found.
In the discrete source model, as the time scale of heat release of the sources
is made small compared to the interparticle diffusion time, the geometric
scaling between cylinders and slabs exhibits values greater than 2:1. The
ability of the flame in the discrete regime to propagate in thinner slabs than
predicted by continuum scaling is attributed to the flame being able to exploit
local fluctuations in concentration across the slab to sustain propagation. As
the heat release time of the sources is increased, the discrete source model
reverts back to results consistent with the continuum model. Implications of
these results for experiments are discussed.

annual cycle that includes a near-standstill in August and another in December.
The cycle is consistent with scattering by highly anisotropic plasma

among two conventions and derive benefits from coordinating neighbors, and
system performance is measured in terms of the agents' welfare. In this paper,
we assess an operator's ability to mitigate two types of adversarial attacks -
1) broad attacks, where the adversary incentivizes all agents in the network
and 2) focused attacks, where the adversary can force a selected subset of the
agents to commit to a prescribed convention. As a mitigation strategy, the
system operator can implement a class of distributed algorithms that govern the

significantly improves when the operator selects a decision-making process at

domains. In many cases, the human and AI form a team, in which the human makes
decisions after reviewing the AI's inferences. A successful partnership
requires that the human develops insights into the performance of the AI

system in this setting. While updates can increase the AI's predictive
performance, they may also lead to changes that are at odds with the user's
prior experiences and confidence in the AI's inferences, hurting therefore the
overall team performance. We introduce the notion of the compatibility of an AI
update with prior user experience and present methods for studying the role of
compatibility in human-AI teams. Empirical results on three high-stakes domains
show that current machine learning algorithms do not produce compatible
updates. We propose a re-training objective to improve the compatibility of an

performance/compatibility tradeoff, enabling more compatible yet accurate
updates.

interactions of a convolutional neural network and a linear layer over a
pre-trained deep network yields a strong binary sequence labeler, with
flexibility in producing predictions at -- and defining loss functions for --
varying label granularities, from the fully-supervised sequence labeling
setting to the challenging zero-shot sequence labeling setting, in which we
seek token-level predictions but only have document-level labels for training.
From this sequence-labeling layer we derive dense representations of the input
that can then be matched to instances from training, or a support set with
known labels. Such introspection with inference-time decision rules provides a
means, in some settings, of making local updates to the model by altering the
labels or instances in the support set without re-training the full model.
Finally, we construct a particular K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) model from
matched exemplar representations that approximates the original model's
predictions and is at least as effective a predictor with respect to the
ground-truth labels. This additionally yields interpretable heuristics at the
token level for determining when predictions are less likely to be reliable,
and for screening input dissimilar to the support set. In effect, we show that
we can transform the deep network into a simple weighting over exemplars and
associated labels, yielding an introspectable -- and modestly updatable --

distort the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) event rate.
The new interactions may involve CP violating phases that can potentially
affect these features. Assuming light vector mediators, we study the effects of
CP violation on the CEvNS process in the COHERENT sodium-iodine, liquid argon
and germanium detectors. We identify a region in parameter space for which the
event rate always involves a dip and another one for which this is never the
case. We show that the presence of a dip in the event rate spectrum can be used
to constraint CP violating effects, in such a way that the larger the detector
volume the tighter the constraints. Furthermore, it allows the reconstruction
of the effective coupling responsible for the signal with an uncertainty
determined by recoil energy resolution. In the region where no dip is present,
we find that CP violating parameters can mimic the Standard Model CEvNS
prediction or spectra induced by real parameters. We point out that the
interpretation of CEvNS data in terms of a light vector mediator should take
into account possible CP violating effects. Finally, we stress that our results
are qualitatively applicable for CEvNS induced by solar or reactor neutrinos.
Thus, the CP violating effects discussed here and their consequences should be
taken into account as well in the analysis of data from multi-ton dark matter
detectors or experiments such as CONUS, $\nu$-cleus or CONNIE.

years. Recent success of deep learning in computer vision has progressed such
research further. However, common limitations with such algorithms are reliance
on a large number of training images, and requirement of careful optimization
of the architecture of deep networks. In this paper, we attempt solving these
issues with transfer learning, where the state-of-the-art VGG architecture is
initialized with pre-trained weights from large benchmark datasets consisting
of natural images. The network is then fine-tuned with layer-wise tuning, where
only a pre-defined group of layers are trained on MRI images. To shrink the
training data size, we employ image entropy to select the most informative
slices. Through experimentation on the ADNI dataset, we show that with training
size of 10 to 20 times smaller than the other contemporary methods, we reach
state-of-the-art performance in AD vs. NC, AD vs. MCI, and MCI vs. NC
classification problems, with a 4% and a 7% increase in accuracy over the
state-of-the-art for AD vs. MCI and MCI vs. NC, respectively. We also provide
detailed analysis of the effect of the intelligent training data selection
method, changing the training size, and changing the number of layers to be
fine-tuned. Finally, we provide Class Activation Maps (CAM) that demonstrate
how the proposed model focuses on discriminative image regions that are
neuropathologically relevant, and can help the healthcare practitioner in
interpreting the model's decision making process.

more bombs can be placed into the same site. A site is destroyed if at least
one explosion occurs. A lock is a protection device which, placed in a site,
prevents its destruction with any number of bombs in it. The important feature
of the model is that AT can and will test every site, trying to find sites
without locks. This testing is not perfect: a test of a site may have a
positive result, even if there is no lock at the site, or a negative result,
even if there is a lock. The probabilities of correct identification of both
types (sensitivity and specificity) are known to both players. In the Bayesian

AT, although the actual positions of the locks are not. After the locks are

Furthermore, to improve the interpretability and compactness of the decoupled

vector with the constraint of sparsity regularization. Unlike conventional
pixel-level or filter-level network interpretation methods, we propose a
path-level analysis to explore the relationship between the combination of

rationale of the decoupled network. Extensive experiments show that the

server to aggregate local model updates. Server-based solutions are prone to
the problem of a single-point-of-failure. In this respect, collaborative
learning frameworks, such as federated learning (FL), are more robust. Existing
federated learning frameworks overlook an important aspect of participation:
fairness. All parties are given the same final model without regard to their
contributions. To address these issues, we propose a decentralized Fair and

federated deep learning models. In particular, we design a local credibility
mutual evaluation mechanism to guarantee fairness, and a three-layer
onion-style encryption scheme to guarantee both accuracy and privacy. Different
from existing FL paradigm, under FPPDL, each participant receives a different
version of the FL model with performance commensurate with his contributions.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FPPDL balances fairness,
privacy and accuracy. It enables federated learning ecosystems to detect and
isolate low-contribution parties, thereby promoting responsible participation.

censorship is less restrictive than one might hope: it apparently allows some
rather bizarre behaviour, and in particular does not prohibit arbitrarily large
angular momenta. We find however that most of the unwelcome geometries
permitted by censorship can be eliminated by requiring stability against
pair-production of branes. We suggest that the small set of surviving
problematic cases can be eliminated in a natural way by imposing a certain

of their discriminative counterparts. They are a natural choice to solve
discriminative tasks in a robust manner as they jointly optimize for predictive
performance and accurate modeling of the input distribution. In this work, we
investigate robust classification with likelihood-based generative models from
a theoretical and practical perspective to investigate if they can deliver on
their promises. Our analysis focuses on a spectrum of robustness properties:
(1) Detection of worst-case outliers in the form of adversarial examples; (2)
Detection of average-case outliers in the form of ambiguous inputs and (3)
Detection of incorrectly labeled in-distribution inputs. Our theoretical result
reveals that it is impossible to guarantee detectability of
adversarially-perturbed inputs even for near-optimal generative classifiers.
Experimentally, we find that while we are able to train robust models for
MNIST, robustness completely breaks down on CIFAR10. We relate this failure to
various undesirable model properties that can be traced to the maximum
likelihood training objective. Despite being a common choice in the literature,
our results indicate that likelihood-based conditional generative models may
are surprisingly ineffective for robust classification.

on the gas surface density, underestimates the $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ in these

single-freefall model of Krumholz et al. 2012 (KDM) is consistent with the
measured $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ in the nucleus and the star-forming clump

Salim et al. 2015 (SFK) agrees slightly better with the observations than the

suppression of the topological characteristics occurs in an intact and only

Predictions were compared against experimental data. It was found that the drag

for the two-way coupling while the second one accounts for the turbulence

codimension $k \geq 1$. A classical result of Gromov and Lawson, refined by
Hanke, Pape and Schick, states that $M$ does not admit a metric of positive
scalar curvature if $k = 2$ and the Dirac operator of $N$ has non-trivial
index, provided that suitable conditions are satisfied. In the cases $k=1$ and
$k=2$, Zeidler and Kubota, respectively, established more systematic results:
There exists a transfer $\mathrm{KO}_\ast(\mathrm{C}^{\ast} \pi_1 M)\to
\mathrm{KO}_{\ast - k}(\mathrm{C}^\ast \pi_1 N)$ which maps the index class of
$M$ to the index class of $N$. The main goal of this article is to construct
analogous transfer maps $E_\ast(\mathrm{B}\pi_1M) \to
E_{\ast-k}(\mathrm{B}\pi_1N)$ for different generalized homology theories $E$
and suitable submanifold embeddings. The design criterion is that it is
compatible with the transfer $E_\ast(M) \to E_{\ast-k}(N)$ induced by the
inclusion $N \subset M$ for a chosen orientation on the normal bundle. Under
varying restrictions on homotopy groups and the normal bundle, we construct
transfers in the following cases in particular: In ordinary homology, it works
for all codimensions. This slightly generalizes a result of Engel and
simplifies his proof. In complex K-homology, we achieve it for $k \leq 3$. For
$k \leq 2$, we have a transfer on the equivariant KO-homology of the
classifying space for proper actions.

final mass of a massive star and the nature of its remnant. Motivated by the
need to reconcile observational values and theory, we use a recently vetted
technique to analyze the mass-loss rates in a sample of OB stars that generate
bowshock nebulae. We measure peculiar velocities from new Gaia parallax and
proper motion data and their spectral types from new optical and infrared
spectroscopy. For our sample of 67 central stars in morphologically selected
bowshocks nebulae, 67 are OB stars. The median peculiar velocity is 11 km/s,
significantly smaller than classical `runaway star' velocities. Mass-loss rates
for these O and early B stars agree with recently lowered theoretical
predictions, ranging from ~10^-7 Msun/yr for mid-O dwarfs to 10^-9 Msun/yr for
late-O dwarfs---a factor of about 2.7 lower than the often-used Vink et al.
(2001) formulation. Our results provide the first observational mass-loss rates
for B0--B3 dwarfs and giants---10^-9 to 10^-8 Msun/yr. We find evidence for an
increase in the mass-loss rates below a critical effective temperature,
consistent with predictions of the bi-stability phenomenon in the range
Teff=19,000--27,000 K. The sample exhibits a correlation between modified wind
momentum and luminosity, consistent in slope but lower by 0.43 dex in magnitude
compared to canonical wind-luminosity relations. We identify a small subset of
objects deviating most significantly from theoretical expectations as probable
radiation-driven bow wave nebulae by virtue of their low stellar-to-nebular
luminosity ratios. For these, the inferred mass-loss rates must be regarded as
upper limits.

in music source separation, whose goal is to separate different sound sources
while maintaining the quality of the separated sounds. Therefore, this paper
investigates using stacked dilated convolutions as the backbone for music
source separation. However, while stacked dilated convolutions can reach wider
context than standard convolutions, their effective receptive fields are still
fixed and may not be wide enough for complex music audio signals. To reach
information at remote locations, we propose to combine dilated convolution with
a modified version of gated recurrent units (GRU) called the `Dilated GRU' to
form a block. A Dilated GRU unit receives information from k steps before
instead of the previous step for a fixed k. This modification allows a GRU unit
to reach a location with fewer recurrent steps and run faster because it can
execute partially in parallel. We show that the proposed model with a stack of
such blocks performs equally well or better than the state-of-the-art models

  Sentiment Analysis","10 pages","ACL 2019",,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In aspect-level sentiment classification (ASC), it is prevalent to equip
dominant neural models with attention mechanisms, for the sake of acquiring the
importance of each context word on the given aspect. However, such a mechanism
tends to excessively focus on a few frequent words with sentiment polarities,
while ignoring infrequent ones. In this paper, we propose a progressive
self-supervised attention learning approach for neural ASC models, which
automatically mines useful attention supervision information from a training
corpus to refine attention mechanisms. Specifically, we iteratively conduct
sentiment predictions on all training instances. Particularly, at each
iteration, the context word with the maximum attention weight is extracted as
the one with active/misleading influence on the correct/incorrect prediction of
every instance, and then the word itself is masked for subsequent iterations.
Finally, we augment the conventional training objective with a regularization
term, which enables ASC models to continue equally focusing on the extracted
active context words while decreasing weights of those misleading ones.
Experimental results on multiple datasets show that our proposed approach
yields better attention mechanisms, leading to substantial improvements over
the two state-of-the-art neural ASC models. Source code and trained models are

shown a spin polarisation, however the degree of helicity is difficult to
quantify from spin measurements. Here, we study 2DTI few-layer Na3Bi on
insulating Al2O3. A non-local conductance measurement geometry enables
sensitive detection of the edge conductance in the topological regime, with an
edge mean free path ~100 nm. Magnetic field suppresses spin-flip scattering in
the helical edges, resulting in a giant negative magnetoresistance (GNMR), up
to 80% at 0.9 T. Comparison to theory indicates >98% of scattering is helical
spin scattering significantly exceeding the maximum (67%) expected for a
non-helical metal. GNMR, coupled with non-local measurements demonstrating edge

platforms due to the intricate interplay between the single-electron nature of

studied mostly using nanowires and carbon nanotubes, which allow a combination
of tunability and proximity. Here we report a new type of quantum dot which
allows proximity to a broad range superconducting systems. The dots are
realized as embedded defects within semiconducting tunnel barriers in
van-der-Waals layers. By placing such layers on top of thin NbSe$_2$, we can
probe the Andreev bound state spectra of such dots up to high in-plane magnetic
fields without observing effects of a diminishing superconducting gap. As
tunnel junctions defined on NbSe$_2$ have a hard gap, we can map the sub-gap
spectra without background related to the rest of the junction. We find that
the proximitized defect states invariably have a singlet ground state, manifest
in the Zeeman splitting of the sub-gap excitation. We also find, in some cases,
bound states which converge to zero energy and remain there. We discuss the
role of the spin-orbit term, present both in the barrier and the

two ways. Firstly, it provides more support and examples describing possible
experimental approaches for purity analysis. A novelty is that it describes how
the beta distribution, or some other suitable probability distribution can be
used to approximate the distribution of the output quantity, i.e., the fraction
of a component. It also provides guidance on how to report coverage intervals
in those cases, where the usual approximation from the GUM (Guide to the
expression of Uncertainty in Measurement) to use the normal or t distribution
is inappropriate because of vicinity of zero. Coverage intervals play an
important role in conformity assessment, and it is also customary to report
measurement uncertainty in the form of a coverage interval, notwithstanding
that ISO/IEC 17025 does not explicitly require it. ISO 6141, which sets
requirements for certificates of calibration gas mixtures, does require the
statement of an expanded uncertainty, which has been interpreted that in the
case of a non-symmetric output probability distribution, a coverage interval
should be stated, along with the value and the standard uncertainty. This paper
gives a brief background to the choices made and examples in ISO 19229.

games. In the class of games we consider, there is a hierarchical game being
played between a leader and a follower with continuous action spaces. We
establish a number of connections between the Nash and Stackelberg equilibrium
concepts and characterize conditions under which attracting critical points of
simultaneous gradient descent are Stackelberg equilibria in zero-sum games.
Moreover, we show that the only stable critical points of the Stackelberg
gradient dynamics are Stackelberg equilibria in zero-sum games. Using this
insight, we develop a gradient-based update for the leader while the follower
employs a best response strategy for which each stable critical point is
guaranteed to be a Stackelberg equilibrium in zero-sum games. As a result, the
learning rule provably converges to a Stackelberg equilibria given an
initialization in the region of attraction of a stable critical point. We then
consider a follower employing a gradient-play update rule instead of a best
response strategy and propose a two-timescale algorithm with similar asymptotic
convergence guarantees. For this algorithm, we also provide finite-time high
probability bounds for local convergence to a neighborhood of a stable
Stackelberg equilibrium in general-sum games. Finally, we present extensive
numerical results that validate our theory, provide insights into the
optimization landscape of generative adversarial networks, and demonstrate that
the learning dynamics we propose can effectively train generative adversarial

rate ($\gamma_{max}$). Here we present a detailed parameter study on the effect
of $T_0$ and $v_e$, within a regime of the frequency ratio ($10 \leq
\frac{\omega_{pe}}{\Omega_{ce}} \leq 30$). In addition to $\gamma_{max}$, we
also analyze the effect on the corresponding wave frequency ($\omega^r_{max}$)
and propagation angle ($\theta_{max}$). We find that (1) $\gamma_{max}$
in-general decreases with increasing $v_e$, while its variation with $T_0$ is
more complex depending on the exact value of $v_e$; (2) with increasing $T_0$
and $v_e$, $\omega^r_{max}$ presents step-wise profiles with jumps separated by
gradual or very-weak variations, and due to the warm-plasma effect on the wave
dispersion relation $\omega^r_{max}$ can vary within the hybrid band (the
harmonic band containing the upper hybrid frequency) and the band higher; (3)
the propagation is either perpendicular or quasi-perpendicular, and
$\theta_{max}$ presents variations in line with those of $\omega^r_{max}$, as
constrained by the resonance condition. We also examine the profiles of

balance the exploitation-exploration trade-off in various applications such as
recommender systems. However, the learning speed of the traditional contextual
bandit algorithms is often slow due to the need for extensive exploration. This
poses a critical issue in applications like recommender systems, since users
may need to provide feedbacks on a lot of uninterested items. To accelerate the
learning speed, we generalize contextual bandit to conversational contextual
bandit. Conversational contextual bandit leverages not only behavioral
feedbacks on arms (e.g., articles in news recommendation), but also occasional
conversational feedbacks on key-terms from the user. Here, a key-term can
relate to a subset of arms, for example, a category of articles in news
recommendation. We then design the Conversational UCB algorithm (ConUCB) to
address two challenges in conversational contextual bandit: (1) which key-terms
to select to conduct conversation, (2) how to leverage conversational feedbacks
to accelerate the speed of bandit learning. We theoretically prove that ConUCB
can achieve a smaller regret upper bound than the traditional contextual bandit
algorithm LinUCB, which implies a faster learning speed. Experiments on
synthetic data, as well as real datasets from Yelp and Toutiao, demonstrate the
efficacy of the ConUCB algorithm.

or 4, and deuces and treys having values 2 and 3, respectively. The target
total is 7 (vs. 21 in blackjack), and ace-trey is a natural. The dealer stands

hit, double, or split, but split pairs receive only one card per paircard (like
split aces in blackjack), and there is no insurance.
  We analyze the game, both single and multiple deck, deriving basic strategy
and one-parameter card-counting systems. Unlike in blackjack, these derivations
can be done by hand, though it may nevertheless be easier and more reliable to

computations that would be prohibitively time-consuming at blackjack. We can
thereby enhance our understanding of blackjack by thoroughly exploring

two clusters: dash and search. The accelerations found in each of the clusters
were distributed normally. The speed and the duration of the clusters exhibited
an exponential distribution. Although the exponential model includes a single
parameter, an additional parameter that indicated instability of the behaviour
was required in many cases for fitting to the data. As this instability
parameter exhibited an inverse correlation with speed, the function of the
brain that maintained stability would be required for a better performance.

an important indicator, was not a robust estimator of the animals' condition.

all graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ can be lifted to the complex plane,
establishing the absence of zeros of the associated partition function in a
complex neighborhood of the region in parameter space corresponding to strong
spatial mixing. This allows us to give unified proofs of several recent results
of this kind, including the resolution by Peters and Regts of the Sokal
conjecture for the partition function of the hard core lattice gas. It also
allows us to prove new results on the location of Lee-Yang zeros of the
anti-ferromagnetic Ising model.
  We show further that our methods extend to the case when weak spatial mixing
on the Bethe lattice is not known to be equivalent to strong spatial mixing on
all graphs. In particular, we show that results on strong spatial mixing in the

zero-freeness results for the associated partition function. This extension
allows us to give the first deterministic FPTAS for counting the number of
$q$-colorings of a graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ provided only that $q\ge

lead to a certain emotion expression in text. Several techniques including rule
based methods and traditional machine learning methods have been proposed to
address this problem based on manually designed rules and features. More
recently, some deep learning methods have also been applied to this task, with
the attempt to automatically capture the causal relationship of emotion and its
causes embodied in the text. In this work, we find that in addition to the
content of the text, there are another two kinds of information, namely
relative position and global labels, that are also very important for emotion
cause identification. To integrate such information, we propose a model based
on the neural network architecture to encode the three elements ($i.e.$, text
content, relative position and global label), in an unified and end-to-end
fashion. We introduce a relative position augmented embedding learning
algorithm, and transform the task from an independent prediction problem to a
reordered prediction problem, where the dynamic global label information is
incorporated. Experimental results on a benchmark emotion cause dataset show
that our model achieves new state-of-the-art performance and performs
significantly better than a number of competitive baselines. Further analysis
shows the effectiveness of the relative position augmented embedding learning
algorithm and the reordered prediction mechanism with dynamic global labels.

introduced. Besides ambiguity itself, we take into account how ambiguity-averse
an agent is. This inclusion of ambiguity attitude, via an $\alpha$-maxmin
nonlinear expectation, renders the stopping problem time-inconsistent. We look
for subgame perfect equilibrium stopping policies, formulated as fixed points
of an operator. For a one-dimensional diffusion with drift and volatility
uncertainty, we show that every equilibrium can be obtained through a
fixed-point iteration. This allows us to capture much more diverse behavior,
depending on an agent's ambiguity attitude, beyond the standard worst-case (or
best-case) analysis. In a concrete example of real options valuation under
volatility uncertainty, all equilibrium stopping policies, as well as the best
one among them, are fully characterized. It demonstrates explicitly the effect
of ambiguity attitude on decision making: the more ambiguity-averse, the more
eager to stop -- so as to withdraw from the uncertain environment. The main
result hinges on a delicate analysis of continuous sample paths in the
canonical space and the capacity theory. To resolve measurability issues, a
generalized measurable projection theorem, new to the literature, is also
established.

  through learning preferences",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine learning has recently been widely adopted to address the managerial
decision making problems, in which the decision maker needs to be able to
interpret the contributions of individual attributes in an explicit form.
However, there is a trade-off between performance and interpretability. Full
complexity models are non-traceable black-box, whereas classic interpretable
models are usually simplified with lower accuracy. This trade-off limits the
application of state-of-the-art machine learning models in management problems,
which requires high prediction performance, as well as the understanding of
individual attributes' contributions to the model outcome. Multiple criteria
decision aiding (MCDA) is a family of analytic approaches to depicting the
rationale of human decision. It is also limited by strong assumptions. To meet
the decision maker's demand for more interpretable machine learning models, we
propose a novel hybrid method, namely Neural Network-based Multiple Criteria
Decision Aiding, which combines an additive value model and a fully-connected
multilayer perceptron (MLP) to achieve good performance while capturing the
explicit relationships between individual attributes and the prediction.
NN-MCDA has a linear component to characterize such relationships through
providing explicit marginal value functions, and a nonlinear component to
capture the implicit high-order interactions between attributes and their
complex nonlinear transformations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NN-MCDA
with extensive simulation studies and three real-world datasets. To the best of
our knowledge, this research is the first to enhance the interpretability of
machine learning models with MCDA techniques. The proposed framework also sheds
light on how to use machine learning techniques to free MCDA from strong

density by iteratively building up a mixture of simple component distributions

computational scalability and approximation error guarantees. But the
guarantees have strong conditions that do not often hold in practice, resulting
in degenerate component optimization problems; and we show that the ad-hoc
regularization used to prevent degeneracy in practice can cause BVI to fail in
unintuitive ways. We thus develop universal boosting variational inference
(UBVI), a BVI scheme that exploits the simple geometry of probability densities
under the Hellinger metric to prevent the degeneracy of other gradient-based
BVI methods, avoid difficult joint optimizations of both component and weight,
and simplify fully-corrective weight optimizations. We show that for any target
density and any mixture component family, the output of UBVI converges to the
best possible approximation in the mixture family, even when the mixture family
is misspecified. We develop a scalable implementation based on exponential
family mixture components and standard stochastic optimization techniques.
Finally, we discuss statistical benefits of the Hellinger distance as a
variational objective through bounds on posterior probability, moment, and
importance sampling errors. Experiments on multiple datasets and models show
that UBVI provides reliable, accurate posterior approximations.

that the global star formation rate is $\sim$1 \Msol yr$^{-1}$, which yields a
star formation efficiency (SFE) of 0.6 Gyr$^{-1}$ (depletion time $\tau =$1.5

(40\,pc resolution) of the relation between molecular gas and star formation
within the stellar component of an elliptical galaxy, from several kpc scale to
the circumnuclear region close to the powerful radio jet. Although on average
the SFEs are similar to those of spiral galaxies, the circumnuclear disk (CND)
presents SFEs of 0.3 Gyr$^{-1}$, lower by a factor of 4 than the outer disk.
The low SFE in the CND is in contrast to the high SFEs found in the literature
for the circumnuclear regions of some nearby disk galaxies with nuclear
activity, probably as a result of larger shear motions and longer AGN feedback.
The higher SFEs in the outer disk suggests that only central molecular gas or
filaments with sufficient density and strong shear motions will remain in
$\sim$1 Gyr, which will later result in the compact molecular distributions and
low SFEs usually seen in other giant ellipticals with cold gas.

play a vital role in affecting the electronic hybridization and magnetic

bright stars across the survey area. I also obtain more precise metallicity
estimates using priors from the $Gaia$ parallaxes for relatively nearby stars.
Close to the Galactic mid-plane ($|Z|<2$ kpc), a mean metallicity map reveals
deviations from the mirror symmetry between the northern and southern
hemispheres, displaying wave-like oscillations. The observed metallicity
asymmetry structure is almost parallel to the Galactic mid-plane, and coincides
with the previously known asymmetry in the stellar number density distribution.
This result reinforces the previous notion of the plane-parallel vertical waves
propagating through the disk, in which a local metallicity perturbation from
the mean vertical metallicity gradient is induced by the phase-space wrapping
of stars in the $Z$-$V_Z$ plane. The maximum amplitude of the metallicity
asymmetry ($\Delta$[Fe/H]$\sim0.05$) implies that these stars have been pulled
away from the Galactic mid-plane by an order of $\Delta|Z|\sim80$ pc as a

point-particle direct numerical simulations (DNS) of gravity-free turbulent
channel flow laden with small inertial particles, with high particle-to-fluid
density ratio and diameter of about $3$ viscous units. The most dilute flow
considered, solid volume fraction $O(10^{-5})$, shows the particle feedback on
the flow to be negligible, whereas differences with respect to the unladen
case, noteworthy a drag increase of about $10\%$, are found for a volume
fraction $O(10^{-4})$. This is attributed to a dense layer of particles at the
wall, caused by turbophoresis, flowing with large particle-to-fluid apparent
slip velocity. The most dilute case is therefore taken as the benchmark for
assessing the validity of a widely used point-particle model, where the
particle dynamics results only from inertial and nonlinear drag forces. In the
bulk of the channel, the first- and second-order moments of the particle
velocity from the point-particle DNS agree well with those from the
interface-resolved DNS. Close to the wall, however, most of the statistics show
major qualitative differences. We show that this difference originates from the
strong shear-induced lift force acting on the particles in the near-wall
region. This mechanism is well captured by the lift force model due to Saffman
(J. Fluid Mech., vol. 22 (2), 1965, pp. 385--400), while other widely used,
more elaborate, approaches aiming at extending the lift model for a wider range
of particle Reynolds numbers can actually underpredict the magnitude of the
near-wall particle velocity fluctuations for the cases analysed here.

latent variables and, when estimated on a collection of unlabelled texts,
learns to choose entities relying both on local context of each mention and on
coherence with other entities in the document. The resulting approach rivals
fully-supervised state-of-the-art systems on standard test sets. It also
approaches their performance in the very challenging setting: when tested on a
test set sampled from the data used to estimate the supervised systems. By
comparing to Wikipedia-only training of our model, we demonstrate that modeling

limitation: any robot will inevitably see new objects in unconstrained

visual modules are usually built on a limited set of classes and are based on
the strong prior that an object must belong to one of those classes.
Identifying whether an instance does not belong to the set of known categories
(i.e. open set recognition), only partially tackles this problem, as a truly
autonomous agent should be able not only to detect what it does not know, but
also to extend dynamically its knowledge about the world. We contribute to this
challenge with a deep learning architecture that can dynamically update its
known classes in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed deep network, based on a
deep extension of a non-parametric model, detects whether a perceived object
belongs to the set of categories known by the system and learns it without the

an image domain transferring task, i.e., from a single or several noise level
domains to a photo-realistic domain. In this paper, we propose an effective
image denoising method by learning two image priors from the perspective of
domain alignment. We tackle the domain alignment on two levels. 1) the
feature-level prior is to learn domain-invariant features for corrupted images
with different level noise; 2) the pixel-level prior is used to push the
denoised images to the natural image manifold. The two image priors are based
on $\mathcal{H}$-divergence theory and implemented by learning classifiers in
adversarial training manners. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for robust image
denoising on both synthetic and real-world noisy images. Furthermore, we show
that the feature-level prior is capable of alleviating the discrepancy between
different level noise. It can be used to improve the blind denoising
performance in terms of distortion measures (PSNR and SSIM), while pixel-level
prior can effectively improve the perceptual quality to ensure the realistic
outputs, which is further validated by subjective evaluation.

substantial hopping between closely placed Ir$^{5+}$ ions within Ir$_2$O$_9$
dimers in these 6H-iridates, modifies spin-orbit coupled states and reduces
spin-orbit excitation energies. Here, we are forced to use at least a two-site
model, to match the excitation spectrum going in line with the strong
intra-dimer hopping. Apart from SOC, low energy physics of iridates is thus
critically dependent on hopping, and may not be ignored even for systems having
moderate hopping, where the excitation spectra can be explained using an atomic
model. SOC which is generally found to be 0.4-0.5~eV in iridates, is scaled in
effect down to $\sim$0.26~eV for the 6H-systems, sustaining the hope to achieve

induce charge density modulations and decisively influence the transport
properties of materials, e.g. leading to conventional superconductivity. In
high critical temperature superconductors, where electronic correlation is the
main actor, the actual role of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is being
intensely debated theoretically and investigated experimentally. We present an
in-depth study of how the EPC strength can be obtained directly from resonant
inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) data through the theoretical approach derived
by Ament et al. [EPL 95, 27008 (2011)]. The role of the model parameters (e.g.
phonon energy $\omega_0$, intermediate state lifetime $1/\Gamma$, EPC matrix
element $M$, and detuning energy $\Omega$) is thoroughly analyzed, providing
general relations among them that can be used to make quantitative estimates of
the dimensionless EPC $g = (M/\omega_0)^2$ without detailed microscopic
modeling. We then apply these methods to very high resolution Cu $L_3$ edge
RIXS spectra of three Nd$_{1+x}$Ba$_{2-x}$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films. For the
insulating antiferromagnetic parent compound the value of $M$ as a function of
the in-plane momentum transfer is obtained for Cu-O bond-stretching (breathing)
and bond-bending (buckling) phonon branches. For the underdoped and the nearly
optimally doped samples, the effects of Coulomb screening and of
charge-density-wave correlations on $M$ are assessed. In light of the
anticipated further improvements of the RIXS experimental resolution, this work
provides a solid framework for an exhaustive investigation of the EPC in
cuprates and other quantum materials.

  Methods: A retrospective study evaluating the diagnostic performance of an AI

243 European ophthalmologists and 208 British optometrists, as determined in
previous studies, for the detection of glaucomatous optic neuropathy from 94

shown that in the zero pressure limit, the two different ground states are
separated by a quantum tricritical point whose position is determined by a
vanishing two-body scattering length. In the presence of a finite three-body
scattering amplitude, the superfluid gas at this point exhibits sound modes
whose velocity scales linearly with density while the compressibility diverges

in principle, provide constraints on new physics scenarios via a comparison of

constraints on specific models and the interpretation of measurements in the
view of effective field theories. A generic problem in the reinterpretations of
Standard Model measurements is the corrections applied to data to account for
detector effects. These corrections inherently assume the Standard Model to be
valid, thus implying a model bias of the final result. In this work, we study
the size of this bias by studying several new physics models and fiducial
phase-space regions. The studies are based on fast detector simulations of a
generic multi-purpose detector at the Large Hadron Collider. We conclude that
the model bias in the associated reinterpretations is negligible only in

precise definition of the final state signatures, has to be performed before

Recently, however, Kirov and Cotterell (2018) showed that modern
encoder-decoder (ED) models overcome many of these flaws. They also presented
evidence that ED models demonstrate humanlike performance in a nonce-word task.
Here, we look more closely at the behaviour of their model in this task. We
find that (1) the model exhibits instability across multiple simulations in
terms of its correlation with human data, and (2) even when results are
aggregated across simulations (treating each simulation as an individual human
participant), the fit to the human data is not strong---worse than an older
rule-based model. These findings hold up through several alternative training
regimes and evaluation measures. Although other neural architectures might do
better, we conclude that there is still insufficient evidence to claim that

temperature at approximately 47 K. From the temperature dependent PRS, it is
observed that a distinct phonon hardening occurs for the G-band modes at

contract to pristine DWNTs where phonon modes saturates to a constant frequency
at low temperatures. The abrupt increase in phonon frequency is indicative of a

coronal sources, and each individual source provides its own critical
information on acceleration of nonthermal electrons and plasma heating. Earlier
studies found that the HXR emission in some events manifests a broken-up
power-law spectrum with the break energy around a few hundred keV based on
spatially-integrated spectral analysis, without distinguishing the
contributions from individual sources. In this paper, we report the broken-up
spectra of a coronal source studied using HXR data recorded by Ramaty High
Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) during the SOL2017-09-10T16:06 (GOES
class X8.2) flare. The flare occurred behind the western limb with its
foot-point sources mostly occulted by the disk, and we could clearly identify
such broken-up spectra pertaining solely to the coronal source during the flare
peak time and after. Since a significant pileup effect on the RHESSI spectra is
expected for this intense solar flare, we have selected the pileup correction
factor, $p = 2$. In this case, we found the resulting \textit{RHESSI}
temperature (~30 MK) similar to the GOES soft X-ray temperature and break
energies of 45--60 keV. Above the break energy the spectrum hardens with time
from spectral index of 3.4 to 2.7, and the difference of spectral indices below
and above the break energy increases from 1.5 to 5 with time. We, however, note
that when $p = 2$ is assumed, a single power-law fitting is also possible with
the RHESSI temperature higher than the GOES temperature by ~10 MK. Possible
scenarios for the broken-up spectra of the loop-top HXR source are briefly
discussed.

problem. Towards learning diversified representations, a new approach, termed
Information Competing Process (ICP), is proposed in this paper. Aiming to
enrich the information carried by feature representations, ICP separates a
representation into two parts with different mutual information constraints.
The separated parts are forced to accomplish the downstream task independently
in a competitive environment which prevents the two parts from learning what
each other learned for the downstream task. Such competing parts are then
combined synergistically to complete the task. By fusing representation parts
learned competitively under different conditions, ICP facilitates obtaining
diversified representations which contain rich information. Experiments on
image classification and image reconstruction tasks demonstrate the great

interpreting images or videos by natural language. Most existing methods resort
to first detecting objects and their relationships, and then generating textual
descriptions, which heavily depends on pre-trained detectors and leads to
performance drop when facing problems of heavy occlusion, tiny-size objects and
long-tail in object detection. In addition, the separate procedure of detecting
and captioning results in semantic inconsistency between the pre-defined
object/relation categories and the target lexical words. We exploit prior human
commonsense knowledge for reasoning relationships between objects without any
pre-trained detectors and reaching semantic coherency within one image or video
in captioning. The prior knowledge (e.g., in the form of knowledge graph)
provides commonsense semantic correlation and constraint between objects that
are not explicit in the image and video, serving as useful guidance to build
semantic graph for sentence generation. Particularly, we present a joint
reasoning method that incorporates 1) commonsense reasoning for embedding image
or video regions into semantic space to build semantic graph and 2) relational
reasoning for encoding semantic graph to generate sentences. Extensive
experiments on the MS-COCO image captioning benchmark and the MSVD video
captioning benchmark validate the superiority of our method on leveraging prior
commonsense knowledge to enhance relational reasoning for visual captioning.

between two domains. Since in a majority of settings paired supervision is not
available, much work focuses on Unsupervised Domain Translation (UDT) where
data samples from each domain are unpaired. Following the seminal work of
CycleGAN for UDT, many variants and extensions of this model have been
proposed. However, there is still little theoretical understanding behind their
success. We observe that these methods yield solutions which are approximately
minimal w.r.t. a given transportation cost, leading us to reformulate the
problem in the Optimal Transport (OT) framework. This viewpoint gives us a new
perspective on Unsupervised Domain Translation and allows us to prove the
existence and uniqueness of the retrieved mapping, given a large family of
transport costs. We then propose a novel framework to efficiently compute
optimal mappings in a dynamical setting. We show that it generalizes previous
methods and enables a more explicit control over the computed optimal mapping.
It also provides smooth interpolations between the two domains. Experiments on
toy and real world datasets illustrate the behavior of our method.

these approaches, they have not yet been fully exploited for automation in a
warehouse system due to expensive sensors and setup requirements. This paper
focuses on the use of low-cost monocular camera-equipped drones for performing
warehouse management tasks like inventory scanning and position update. The
methods introduced are at par with the existing state of warehouse environment
present today, that is, the existence of a grid network for the ground
vehicles, hence eliminating any additional infrastructure requirement for drone
deployment. As we lack scale information, that in itself forbids us to use any
3D techniques, we focus more towards optimizing standard image processing
algorithms like the thick line detection and further developing it into a fast
and robust grid localization framework. In this paper, we show different line
detection algorithms, their significance in grid localization and their
limitations. We further extend our proposed implementation towards a real-time
navigation stack for an actual warehouse inspection case scenario. Our line
detection method using skeletonization and centroid strategy works considerably
even with varying light conditions, line thicknesses, colors, orientations, and
partial occlusions. A simple yet effective Kalman Filter has been used for
smoothening the {\rho} and {\theta} outputs of the two different line detection
methods for better drone control while grid following. A generic strategy that
handles the navigation of the drone on a grid for completion of the allotted
task is also developed. Based on the simulation and real-life experiments, the
final developments on the drone localization and navigation in a structured
environment are discussed.

correspondences of a person moving through a non-overlapping multi-camera
installation. Recent advances based on deep learning models for this task
mainly focus on supervised learning scenarios where accurate annotations are
assumed to be available for each setup. Annotating large scale datasets for
person re-identification is demanding and burdensome, which renders the
deployment of such supervised approaches to real-world applications infeasible.
Therefore, it is necessary to train models without explicit supervision in an
autonomous manner. In this paper, we propose an elegant and practical
clustering approach for unsupervised person re-identification based on the
cluster validity consideration. Concretely, we explore a fundamental concept in
statistics, namely \emph{dispersion}, to achieve a robust clustering criterion.
Dispersion reflects the compactness of a cluster when employed at the
intra-cluster level and reveals the separation when measured at the
inter-cluster level. With this insight, we design a novel Dispersion-based
Clustering (DBC) approach which can discover the underlying patterns in data.
This approach considers a wider context of sample-level pairwise relationships
to achieve a robust cluster affinity assessment which handles the complications
may arise due to prevalent imbalanced data distributions. Additionally, our
solution can automatically prioritize standalone data points and prevents
inferior clustering. Our extensive experimental analysis on image and video
re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a significant margin. Code is

that the period can be reliably extracted even for time windows of length one
quarter of the full period. We then turn to a long turbulent trajectory,
sliding an observation window through the time series and performing many DMD
computations. Our approach yields many more converged periodic orbits
(including multiple new solutions) than a standard recurrent flow analysis of
the same data. Furthermore, it also yields converged UPOs at points where the
recurrent flow analysis flagged a near recurrence but the Newton solver did not
converge, suggesting that the new approach can be used alongside the old to
generate improved initial guesses. Finally, we discuss some heuristics on what
constitutes a ""good"" time window for the DMD to identify a UPO.

an exact quaternary Jordan-Wigner mapping involving two Kitaev rings and two
spin rings with periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions. This mapping
facilitates us to demonstrate exactly how a topological extended-kink (TEK)
phase develops in the interacting Kitaev ring with odd number of lattice sites.
The emergence of this new phase is attributed to the effect of geometrical ring
frustration. Unlike the usual topological phases protected by energy gap in
noninteracting systems, the TEK phase is gapless. And because the spectra of
low energy excitations are quadratic, the specific heat per site approaches a
half of Boltzmann constant near absolute zero temperature. More interestingly,
the ground state is unique, immune to spontaneous symmetry breaking. It
exhibits a long-range correlation function with a nonlocal factor, but no local
order parameter can be defined. As a concomitant effect, a special kind of
localized kink zero mode (KZM) takes place if we introduce a type of bond
defect. We also show that the KZM is robust against moderate disorders.

a spatial averaging operator to the microscopic equations, we obtain a

generalisation of the multi-rate mass transfer (MRMT) model, originally
introduced by Haggerty & Gorelick. This new formulation does not require any
assumption on local equilibrium or geometry. We then show that the MRMT can be

in local equilibrium. The new Generalised Multi-Rate Mode (GMRM) has the
advantage of providing a direct method for calculating the model coefficients
for immobile regions of arbitrary shapes, through the solution of appropriate
micro-scale cell problems. An important finding is that a simple re-scaling or
re-parametrisation of the transfer rate coefficient (and thus, the memory

$\alpha$, has been used as an argument for a photospheric origin of GRB
spectra. Here, we investigate what fraction of GRBs have spectra that are
consistent with emission from a photopshere in a non-dissipative outflow. This
is the simplest possible photospheric emission scenario. We create synthetic
spectra, with a range of peak energies, by folding the theoretical predictions
through the detector response of the FERMI/GBM detector. These simulated
spectral data are fit with typically employed empirical models. We find that
the low-energy photon indices obtain values ranging $-0.4 < \alpha < 0.0$,
peaking at around $-0.1$, thus covering a non-negligible fraction of observed
values. These values are significantly softer than the asymptotic value of the
theoretical spectrum of $\alpha \sim 0.4$. The reason for the $\alpha$-values
to be much softer than expected, is the limitation of the empirical functions
to capture the true curvature of the theoretical spectrum. We conclude that
more than a $1/4$ of the bursts in the GBM catalogue have at least one
time-resolved spectrum, whose $\alpha$-values are consistent with a
non-dissipative outflow, releasing its thermal energy at the photosphere. The
fraction of spectra consistent with emission from the photosphere will increase
even more if dissipation of kinetic energy in the flow occurs below the
photosphere.

classical risk-neutral approach and the benchmark approach, and we examine the
associated static and optimal behaviors of both the investor and insurer. The
first model considered is the so-called minimal market model, where pricing is
achieved using the benchmark approach. The benchmark approach was introduced by
Platen in 2001 and has received wide acceptance in the finance community. Under
this approach, valuing an asset involves determining the minimum-valued
replicating portfolio, with reference to the growth optimal portfolio under the
real-world probability measure, and it both subsumes classical risk-neutral
pricing as a particular case and extends it to situations where risk-neutral
pricing is impossible. The second model is the Black-Scholes model for the
equity index, where the pricing of contracts is performed within the
risk-neutral framework. Crucially, we demonstrate that when the insurer prices
and reserves using the Black-Scholes model, while the insured employs a dynamic
withdrawal strategy based on the minimal market model, the insurer may be
underestimating the value and associated reserves of the contract.

exponential sums with equal weights: $$H_n(z; h)=\frac{\mu}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n
h(\lambda_k z),\quad \text{where}\quad \mu,\lambda_k\in \mathbb{C},$$ and $h$
is a fixed analytic function under few natural assumptions. The interpolation
of a function $f$ by $H_n$ is due to properly chosen $\mu$ and
$\{\lambda_k\}_{k=1}^n$, which depend on $f$, $h$ and $n$. The sums $H_n$ are
related to the $h$-sums and generalized exponential sums, i.e. to
$$\mathcal{H}^*_n(z; h)=\sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k h(\lambda_k z)\quad
\text{and}\quad\mathcal{H}_n(z; h):=\sum_{k=1}^n \mu_k h(\lambda_k z),\quad
\text{where}\quad \mu_k,\lambda_k\in \mathbb{C},$$ which generalize many
classical approximants and whose properties are actively studied. As for the
Pad\'e problem, we show that $H_n$ and $\mathcal{H}_n^*$ have similar
constructions and rates of interpolation, whereas calculating $H_n$ requires
less arithmetic operations. Although the Pad\'e problem for $\mathcal{H}_n$ is
known to have a doubled interpolation rate with respect to $\mathcal{H}_n^*$
and thus to $H_n$, it can be however unsolvable in many useful cases and this
may entirely eliminate the advantage of $\mathcal{H}_n$. We show that, in
contrast to $\mathcal{H}_n$, the Pad\'e problem for $H_n$ always has a unique
solution. More importantly, we also obtain efficient estimates for $\mu$ and
$\lambda_k$, valuable by themselves, and use them in further evaluating
interpolation quality and in applications. The Pad\'e problem and estimates
provide a basis for managing the more interesting Prony problem for exponential
sums with equal weights $H_n(z;\exp)$, i.e. when $h(z)=\exp(z)$. We show that
it is uniquely solvable and surprisingly $\mu$ and $\lambda_k$ can be
efficiently estimated. This is in sharp contrast to the case of well-known
exponential sums $\mathcal{H}_n(z;\exp)$.

classical Fenchel duality and derive a strong duality result for a predual
problem in the space of continuous functions. However, this problem may not
admit a minimizer, which prevents obtaining primal-dual optimality conditions.
We then show that the primal problem is naturally analyzed in the Orlicz space
of functions with finite entropy in the sense that the entropically regularized
problem admits a minimizer if and only if the marginals have finite entropy. We
then derive a dual problem in the corresponding dual space, for which existence
can be shown by purely variational arguments and primal-dual optimality
conditions can be derived. For marginals that do not have finite entropy, we
finally show Gamma-convergence of the regularized problem with smoothed

new training data which is not available or straightforward to acquire, and
model outputs are simple and may be dull and repetitive. This paper addresses
these two critical challenges in NNLG by: (1) scalably (and at no cost)
creating training datasets of parallel meaning representations and reference
texts with rich style markup by using data from freely available and naturally
descriptive user reviews, and (2) systematically exploring how the style markup
enables joint control of semantic and stylistic aspects of neural model output.
We present YelpNLG, a corpus of 300,000 rich, parallel meaning representations

attributes, and describe a novel methodology that can be scalably reused to
generate NLG datasets for other domains. The experiments show that the models
control important aspects, including lexical choice of adjectives, output

have illustrated significant advantages by focusing on individual regions of
interest (RoIs) for faces and facial components. However, the traditional
crop-and-resize focusing mechanism ignores all contextual area outside the
RoIs, and thus is not suitable when the component area is unpredictable, e.g.
hair. Inspired by the physiological vision system of human, we propose a novel

class affecting modern CPUs. The attacks rely on the ability to misguide
speculative execution, generally by exploiting the branch prediction
structures, to execute a vulnerable code sequence speculatively. In this paper,
we propose to use Control-Flow Integrity (CFI), a security technique used to
stop control-flow hijacking attacks, on the committed path, to prevent
speculative control-flow from being hijacked to launch the most dangerous
variants of the Spectre attacks (Spectre-BTB and Spectre-RSB). Specifically,
CFI attempts to constrain the possible targets of an indirect branch to a set
of legal targets defined by a pre-calculated control-flow graph (CFG). As CFI
is being adopted by commodity software (e.g., Windows and Android) and
commodity hardware (e.g., Intel's CET and ARM's BTI), the CFI information
becomes readily available through the hardware CFI extensions. With the CFI
information, we apply CFI principles to also constrain illegal control-flow
during speculative execution. Specifically, our proposed defense, SPECCFI,
ensures that control flow instructions target legal destinations to constrain
dangerous speculation on forward control-flow paths (indirect calls and
branches). We augment this protection with a precise speculation-aware hardware
stack to constrain speculation on backward control-flow edges (returns). We
combine this solution with existing solutions against branch target predictor
attacks (Spectre-PHT) to close all known non-vendor-specific Spectre
vulnerabilities. We show that SPECCFI results in small overheads both in terms

space, which quantifies the fractional ""mismatch"" $m$ between two (time- or
frequency-domain) waveforms. When searching for weak gravitational-wave or
electromagnetic signals from sources with unknown parameters $\lambda$ (masses,
sky locations, frequencies, etc.) the metric can be used to create and/or
characterize ""template banks"". These are grids of points in parameter space;
the metric is used to ensure that the points are correctly separated from one
another. For small coordinate separations $d\lambda^a$ between two points in
parameter space, the traditional ansatz for the mismatch is a quadratic form
$m=g_{ab} d\lambda^a d\lambda^b$. This is a good approximation for small
separations but at large separations it diverges, whereas the actual mismatch
is bounded. Here we introduce and discuss a simple ""spherical"" ansatz for the
mismatch $m=\sin^2(\sqrt{g_{ab} d\lambda^a d\lambda^b})$. This agrees with the
metric ansatz for small separations, but we show that in simple cases it
provides a better (and bounded) approximation for large separations, and argue
that this is also true in the generic case. This ansatz should provide a more
accurate approximation of the mismatch for semi-coherent searches, and may also
be of use when creating grids for hierarchical searches that (in some stages)
operate at relatively large mismatch.

three events a limb CMEs resulted in moderately geoeffective in-situ structures
at their target location in terms of the disturbance storm time (Dst) index

geomagnetic response, erupted from close to the disc centre as seen from Earth,
but it was not visible in coronagraph images from the spacecraft along the
Sun--Earth line and appeared narrow and faint from off-angle viewpoints. Making
the correct connection between CMEs at the Sun and their in-situ counterparts
is often difficult for problem storms. We investigate these four CMEs using
multiwavelength and multipoint remote-sensing observations (extreme
ultraviolet, white light, and radio), aided by 3D heliospheric modelling, in

ambiguous events and the importance of multispacecraft data for observing and

interpolation function (HVFIF) constructed by recurrent iterated function
system (RIFS) with function contractivity factors. The contractivity factors of

HVRFIF with function contractivity factors has more flexibility and diversity
than the HVFIF with constant contractivity factors. Stability of interpolation
function according to perturbation of the contractivity factors and the
box-counting dimension of interpolation function plays very important roles in
determining whether these functions can be applied to practical problems or
not. We first estimate errors on perturbation of function contractivity factors
and then obtain the upper and lower bounds of the box-counting dimension of one

help to better understand these phenomena but requires simulating the
interactions between different individuals. In the case of large populations,
assessing the parameters of a heterogeneous population model from experimental
data is intractable computationally. This paper investigates the mean-field
approximation of large dynamical systems with random initial conditions and
individual parameters, and with interaction being represented by pairwise
potentials between individuals. Under this approximation, each individual is in
interaction with an infinitely-crowded population, summarized by a probability
measure, the mean-field limit distribution, being itself the weak solution of a
non-linear hyperbolic partial differential equation. In particular, the
phenomenon of chaos propagation implies that the individuals are independent
asymptotically when the size of the population tends towards infinity. This
result provides perspectives for a possible simplification of the inference
problem. The simulation of the mean-field distribution, consisting in a

radii $R_1 = 10.4_{-2.8}^{+10.8}$ km and $R_2 = 0.5_{-0.3}^{+0.9}$ km,
respectively (assuming a distance of 1 kpc). A broad absorption line modeled
with a Gaussian profile centred at $0.39_{-0.03}^{+0.02}$ keV is required in
the fit. The pulse profile of PSR J0726-2612 is characterized by two peaks with
similar intensity separated by two unequal minima, a shape and pulsed fraction
that cannot be reproduced without invoking magnetic beaming of the X-ray
emission. The presence of a single radio pulse suggests that in PSR J0726-2612
the angles that the dipole axis and the line of sight make with the rotation
axis, $\xi$ and $\chi$ respectively, are similar. This geometry differs from
that of the two radio-silent XDINSs with a double peaked pulse profile similar
to that of PSR J0726-2612, for which $\xi \sim 90^\circ$ and $\chi \sim
45^\circ$ have been recently estimated. These results strengthen the similarity
between PSR J0726-2612 and the XDINSs and support the possibility that the lack
of radio emission from the latter might simply be due to an unfavourable
viewing geometry.

Plasmons allow for the concentration of the energy from light, down to sizes

this thesis, we have investigated the optical and plasmonic properties of
semi-continuous gold films (also called percolation films). These films consist
of complex tortuous fractal patterns on the nanoscale. They are an easy, fast,
and scalable method to fabricate metallic nanostructures. We show, that despite
their very complex overall geometry, a large part of the films' properties can
be understood alone based on their strongly localized plasmonic 'hotspots' -
areas of just a few nanometres in the films, wherein optical fields are
enhanced several thousand times. Additionally, we show that such films can be
used for the enhancement of gold two-photon photoluminescence and white light
continuum generation. We have also shown that it is possible, via
femtosecond-laser pulses, to inscribe information into the films, via
phototheral processes. This has potential applications for ultra-dense

remote sensing recently. Compared with the large-scale annotated dataset in
natural images, the lack of labeled data in remote sensing becomes an obstacle
to train a deep network very well, especially in SAR image interpretation.
Transfer learning provides an effective way to solve this problem by borrowing
the knowledge from the source task to the target task. In optical remote
sensing application, a prevalent mechanism is to fine-tune on an existing model
pre-trained with a large-scale natural image dataset, such as ImageNet.
However, this scheme does not achieve satisfactory performance for SAR
application because of the prominent discrepancy between SAR and optical
images. In this paper, we attempt to discuss three issues that are seldom
studied before in detail: (1) what network and source tasks are better to
transfer to SAR targets, (2) in which layer are transferred features more
generic to SAR targets and (3) how to transfer effectively to SAR targets
recognition. Based on the analysis, a transitive transfer method via
multi-source data with domain adaptation is proposed in this paper to decrease
the discrepancy between the source data and SAR targets. Several experiments
are conducted on OpenSARShip. The results indicate that the universal
conclusions about transfer learning in natural images cannot be completely
applied to SAR targets, and the analysis of what and where to transfer in SAR
target recognition is helpful to decide how to transfer more effectively.

apparently anomalous incorporation of O atoms into dust in dense clouds. We
re-visit the question of the depletion of the elements incorporated into the

light of recent analyses of the organics in comets, meteorites and

into an amorphous a-C:H:O:N phase, we posit that a significant fraction of C

viable solution to the oxygen depletion problem. Further, the thermal or

they reside in is still not fully understood. A debris disc can evolve due to
self-stirring, a process in which planetesimals can excite their neighbours to
the point of destructive collisions. In addition, the presence of a companion
could further stir the disc (companion-stirring). Additional information is
necessary to understand this fundamental step in the formation and evolution of
a planetary system, and at the moment of writing only a handful of systems are
known where a companion and a debris disc have both been detected and studied
at the same time.
  Aims. Our primary goal is to augment the sample of these systems and to
understand the relative importance between self-stirring and
companion-stirring.
  Methods. In the course of the VLT/NaCo Imaging Survey for Planets around
Young stars (ISPY), we observed HD 193571, an A0 debris disc hosting star at a
distance of 68 pc with an age between 60 and 170 Myr. We obtained two sets of
observations in L' band and a third epoch in H band using the GPI instrument at
Gemini-South.
  Results. A companion was detected in all three epochs at a projected
separation of 11 au (0.17 arcsec), and co-motion was confirmed through proper
motion analysis. Given the inferred disc size of 120 au, the companion appears
to reside within the gap between the host star and the disc. Comparison between
the L' and H band magnitude and evolutionary tracks suggests a mass of 0.31 -
0.39 solar masses .
  Conclusions. We discovered a previously unknown M-dwarf companion around HD
193571, making it the third low-mass stellar object discovered within a debris
disc. A comparison to self- and companion-stirring models suggests that the
companion is likely responsible for the stirring of the disc.

characterized in terms of maximal fidelity and fidelity deviation. The former
quantifies optimality of the process and is defined as the maximal average
fidelity achievable within the standard protocol and local unitary strategies,
whereas the latter, defined as the standard deviation of fidelity over all
input states, is a measure of fidelity fluctuations. The maximal fidelity for a
two-qubit state is known and is given by a simple formula that can be exactly
computed, but no such formula is known for the fidelity deviation. In this
paper, we derive an exact computable formula for the fidelity deviation in
optimal quantum teleportation with an arbitrary state of two qubits. From this
formula, we obtain the dispersion-free condition, also known as the
universality condition: the condition that all input states are teleported
equally well and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a state to be
both useful (maximal fidelity larger than the classical bound) and universal
(zero fidelity deviation). We also show that for any given maximal fidelity,
larger than the classical bound, there always exist dispersion-free or
universal states and argue that such states are the most desirable ones within
the set of useful states. We illustrate these results with well-known families
of two-qubit states: pure entangled states, Bell-diagonal states, and subsets
of $X$ states.

demonstrate that the naively expected vacuum superconductivity (VSC) in
constant magnetic field ${\bf B}=B\hat z$ is disfavored due to the splitting
magnetic catalysis effect (MCE) to chiral condensates with different quark
flavors. Based on the simple two-flavor NJL model, we illuminate, in the lowest
Landau level approximation, the similar origins of $\pi^0$ and $\bar{\rho}^+_1$
(${\rho}^+$ meson with spin $S_z=1$) mass reductions with smaller $B$ and their
different features at larger $B$. With the full Landau levels, the two-flavor
NJL model is found to be invalid to study the magnetic field effect to
$\bar{\rho}^+_1$ meson with physical vacuum mass $775~{\rm MeV}$. Then,
restricted to $\rho$ meson mass below two-quark threshold in vacuum, that is
$m_\rho^v<2m_q^v$, it is found that $\pi^0$ mass decreases and then increases
with $B$ slowly, and $\bar{\rho}^+_1$ mass vanishing point is delayed to larger
$B$ compared to the point particle result. In the more realistic three-flavor
NJL model, all the quark masses split in strong magnetic field as a
combinatorial result of their different current masses and electric charges. By
choosing a vacuum mass closer to the physical one, $\bar{\rho}^+_1$ meson mass
is found to be consistent with the LQCD results semi-quantitatively in smaller
$B$ region but increase in larger $B$ region. These features are mainly
outcomes of the interplay between the $S_z-B$ coupling effect and splitting MCE
to the composite $u$ and $d$ quarks, which definitely disfavors VSC when the
latter dominates. Furthermore, mesonic flavor mixing is modified by $B$ among
the neutral pseudoscalars: $\pi^0,\eta_0$ and $\eta_8$, which is very important
to suppress the mass enhancement of the effective mass eigenstates at large
$B$.

neural networks improve human pose estimation using supervised training data,
our focus is to explore the semi- and weakly-supervised schemes. Our proposed
schemes initially learn conventional model(s) for pose estimation from a small
amount of standard training images with human pose annotations. For the first
semi-supervised learning scheme, this conventional pose model detects candidate
poses in training images with no human annotation. From these candidate poses,
only true-positives are selected by a classifier using a pose feature
representing the configuration of all body parts. The accuracies of these
candidate pose estimation and true-positive pose selection are improved by
action labels provided to these images in our second and third learning
schemes, which are semi- and weakly-supervised learning. While the first and
second learning schemes select only poses that are similar to those in the
supervised training data, the third scheme selects more true-positive poses
that are significantly different from any supervised poses. This pose selection
is achieved by pose clustering using outlier pose detection with Dirichlet
process mixtures and the Bayes factor. The proposed schemes are validated with
large-scale human pose datasets.

inter-organizational business processes involving mutually untrusted parties.
Existing approaches to blockchain-based process execution are based on code
generation. In these approaches, a process model is compiled into one or more
smart contracts, which are then deployed on a blockchain platform. Given the
immutability of the deployed smart contracts, these compiled approaches ensure
that all process instances conform to the process model. However, this
advantage comes at the price of inflexibility. Any changes to the process model
require the redeployment of the smart contracts (a costly operation). In
addition, changes cannot be applied to running process instances. To address
this lack of flexibility, this paper presents an interpreter of BPMN process
models based on dynamic data structures. The proposed interpreter is embedded
in a business process execution system with a modular multi-layered
architecture, supporting the creation, execution, monitoring and dynamic update
of process instances. For efficiency purposes, the interpreter relies on
compact bitmap-based encodings of process models. An experimental evaluation
shows that the proposed interpreted approach achieves comparable or lower costs
relative to existing compiled approaches.

Algebraically the simplest case is that of a two-dimensional parity-invariant
six-fold rotation-symmetric flow, where eddy viscosity is negative, indicating
intervals of large-scale instability of the flow. Turning to the kinematic
dynamo problem for three-dimensional flows of an incompressible fluid, we
explore application of Pad\'e approximants for computation of tensors of
magnetic $\alpha$-effect and, for parity-invariant flows, of magnetic eddy
diffusivity. We construct Pad\'e approximants of the tensors expanded in power
series in the inverse molecular diffusivity $1/\eta$ around $1/\eta=0$. This
yields the values of the dominant growth rate due to the action of the
$\alpha$-effect or eddy diffusivity to satisfactory accuracy for $\eta$,
several dozen times smaller than the threshold, above which the power series is
convergent. For one sample flow, we observe eddy diffusivity tending to
negative infinity when $\eta$ tends from above to the point of the onset of
small-scale dynamo action in a symmetry-invariant subspace where a neutral
small-scale magnetic mode resides. However, 49 first coefficients in the power
series in $1/\eta$ prove insufficient for Pad\'e approximants to reproduce this
behaviour. We do computations in Fortran in the standard `double' (real*8) and
extended `quadruple' (real*16) precision, as well as perform symbolic
calculations in Mathematica.

highly-spin-polarized two-dimensional (2D) electron systems in

TcO$_2$ uni-cell layer (one-unit-cell thickness) on rutile TiO$_2$ (001)
substrate as a semiconductor heterostructure and use electric field to
manipulate its electronic and magnetic properties. Our study shows that the
heterostructure is a narrow-gap semiconductor with an antiferromagnet-like
ordering when the applied electric field is less than 0.026 V/\AA{}, and then
it transits to a half-metallic ferrimagnet with 100\% spin polarization. Our
further analysis indicates that the magnetization density and the electronic
states near the Fermi level originate mainly from the TcO$_2$ uni-cell layer,
with the remaining minor part from the interfacial Ti-O$_2$ monolayers, and the
bonds and bond angles quickly converge to the corresponding values of bulk
TiO$_2$ when crossing the interface and entering the TiO$_2$ layer. Therefore,
the heterostructure is actually a 2D electron system determined by the TcO$_2$
uni-cell layer and the TiO$_2$ substrate. Because the half-metallic phase with
100\% spin polarization can be achieved at 0.026 V/\AA{}, this epitaxial 2D

a small voltage. The S and CH$_3$S systems, on the contrary, exhibit rather low

Generating test inputs at
the unit level is fast, but can lead to false alarms when a function is called
with inputs that would not occur in a system context. If a generated input at
the system level causes a failure, this is a true alarm, as the input could
also have come from the user or a third party; but system testing is much
slower.
  In this paper, we introduce the concept of a test generation bridge, which
joins the accuracy of system testing with the speed of unit testing. A Test
Generation Bridge allows to combine an arbitrary system test generator with an
arbitrary unit test generator. It does so by carving parameterized unit tests
from system (test) executions. These unit tests run in a context recorded from
the system test, but individual parameters are left free for the unit test
generator to systematically explore. This allows symbolic test generators such
as KLEE to operate on individual functions in the recorded system context. If
the test generator detects a failure, we lift the failure-inducing parameter
back to the system input; if the failure can be reproduced at the system level,
it is reported as a true alarm. Our BASILISK prototype can extract and test
units out of complex systems such as a Web/Python/SQLite/C stack; in its
evaluation, it achieves a higher coverage than a state-of-the-art system test

complex, non-transitive reward structure (think rock/paper/scissors). It turns
out that most current deep reinforcement learning methods fail to efficiently
explore the strategy space, thus learning policies that generalise poorly to
unseen opponents. We then propose a novel hierarchical agent architecture,
where the hierarchy is grounded in the game-theoretic structure of the game --
the top level chooses strategic responses to opponents, while the low level
implements them into policy over primitive actions. This grounding facilitates
credit assignment across the levels of hierarchy. Our experiments show that the
proposed hierarchical agent is capable of generalisation to unseen opponents,
while conventional baselines fail to generalise whatsoever.

introduced a new parameter and required knowledge of strong convexity and
smoothness constants, which is rarely possible in practice. We rehabilitate the
method by introducing a new variant that needs only smoothness constant and
does not have any extra parameters. Furthermore, when removing the strong
convexity constant from the stepsize, we present a new analysis of the method,
which no longer uses the assumption that every component is strongly convex.
This allows us to also obtain so far unknown nonconvex convergence of MISO. To
make the proposed method efficient in practice, we derive minibatching bounds

(AI): (1) Why is deep learning so successful in classification problems and (2)
why are neural nets based on deep learning at the same time universally
unstable, where the instabilities make the networks vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. We present a solution to these questions that can be summed up in two
words; false structures. Indeed, deep learning does not learn the original
structures that humans use when recognising images (cats have whiskers, paws,
fur, pointy ears, etc), but rather different false structures that correlate
with the original structure and hence yield the success. However, the false
structure, unlike the original structure, is unstable. The false structure is
simpler than the original structure, hence easier to learn with less data and
the numerical algorithm used in the training will more easily converge to the
neural network that captures the false structure. We formally define the
concept of false structures and formulate the solution as a conjecture. Given
that trained neural networks always are computed with approximations, this
conjecture can only be established through a combination of theoretical and
computational results similar to how one establishes a postulate in theoretical
physics (e.g. the speed of light is constant). Establishing the conjecture
fully will require a vast research program characterising the false structures.
We provide the foundations for such a program establishing the existence of the
false structures in practice. Finally, we discuss the far reaching consequences
the existence of the false structures has on state-of-the-art AI and Smale's

patterns (if any), and replace them by new, randomly extracted patterns. This
""remove and replace"" procedure is iterated until perfect classification is
achieved. We call this procedure ""self-planting"" because the ""planted"" state is
not pre-assigned but results from a co-evolution of weights and patterns. We
find an algorithmic phase transition separating a region in which self-planting
is efficiently achieved from a region in which it takes exponential time in the
system size. We conjecture that this transition might exist in a broad class of
similar problems.

the value of this volume remains an arbitrary parameter devoid of physical

Gradient Descent (SGD) and Discrete Optimization in an unconventional way. Our
idea is to define a discrete neighborhood of the current SGD point containing a
number of ""potentially good moves"" that exploit gradient information, and to
search this neighborhood by using a classical metaheuristic scheme borrowed
from Discrete Optimization.
  In the present paper we investigate the use of a simple Simulated Annealing
(SA) metaheuristic that accepts/rejects a candidate new solution in the
neighborhood with a probability that depends both on the new solution quality
and on a parameter (the temperature) which is modified over time to lower the
probability of accepting worsening moves. We use this scheme as an automatic
way to perform hyper-parameter tuning, hence the title of the paper. A
distinctive feature of our scheme is that hyper-parameters are modified within
a single SGD execution (and not in an external loop, as customary) and
evaluated on the fly on the current minibatch, i.e., their tuning is fully
embedded within the SGD algorithm.
  The use of SA for training is not new, but previous proposals were mainly
intended for non-differentiable objective functions for which SGD is not
applied due to the lack of gradients. On the contrary, our SA method requires
differentiability of (a proxy of) the loss function, and leverages on the
availability of a gradient direction to define local moves that have a large
probability to improve the current solution.
  Computational results on image classification (CIFAR-10) are reported,
showing that the proposed approach leads to an improvement of the final
validation accuracy for modern Deep Neural Networks such as ResNet34 and VGG16.

energetic sources in the universe. The recent construction of large scale
observatories opened new possibilities in testing non thermal cosmic processes
with alternative probes, such as high energy neutrinos and gravitational waves.
We propose to combine information from gravitational wave detections, neutrino
observations and electromagnetic signals to obtain a comprehensive picture of
some of the most extreme cosmic processes. Gravitational waves are indicative
of source dynamics, such as the formation, evolution and interaction of compact
objects. These compact objects can play an important role in astrophysical
particle acceleration, and are interesting candidates for neutrino and in
general high-energy astroparticle studies. In particular we will concentrate on
the most promising gravitational wave emitter sources: compact stellar
remnants. The merger of binary black holes, binary neutron stars or black
hole-neutron star binaries are abundant gravitational wave sources and will
likely make up the majority of detections. However, stellar core collapse with
rapidly rotating core may also be significant gravitational wave emitter, while
slower rotating cores may be detectable only at closer distances. The joint
detection of gravitational waves and neutrinos from these sources will probe
the physics of the sources and will be a smoking gun of the presence of hadrons
in these objects which is still an open question. Conversely, the non-detection
of neutrinos or gravitational waves from these sources will be fundamental to
constrain the hadronic content.

electron beams are produced by diffracting electrons through thin
single-crystal silicon membranes that are lithographically patterned to
different thicknesses. For transform-limited x-ray production the desired
pattern is a series of regularly spaced lines (i.e. a grating) that generate
uniformly spaced nanobunches of electrons, however nearly any pattern can be
etched in the silicon, such as frequency-chirps or multiple patterns of
different colors or line spacings. When these patterns are transferred from the
spatial to the temporal dimension by accelerator electromagnetic optics they
will control the phase fronts of coherent x-rays, giving unprecedented
deterministic control over the phase of ultrashort x-ray pulses. In short, this
method allows the time-structure for a fully coherent x-ray beam to be

adversarial training strategies. However, most existing methods focus on
transfer of style and appearance, rather than on shape translation. The latter
task is challenging, due to its intricate non-local nature, which calls for
additional supervision. We mitigate this by descending the deep layers of a
pre-trained network, where the deep features contain more semantics, and
applying the translation from and between these deep features. Specifically, we
leverage VGG, which is a classification network, pre-trained with large-scale
semantic supervision. Our translation is performed in a cascaded,
deep-to-shallow, fashion, along the deep feature hierarchy: we first translate
between the deepest layers that encode the higher-level semantic content of the
image, proceeding to translate the shallower layers, conditioned on the deeper
ones. We show that our method is able to translate between different domains,
which exhibit significantly different shapes. We evaluate our method both

behavior of stochastic bandits algorithms under \emph{strategic behavior}
conducted by rational actors, i.e., the arms. Each arm is a
\emph{self-interested} strategic player who can modify its own reward whenever
pulled, subject to a cross-period budget constraint, in order to maximize its
own expected number of times of being pulled. We analyze the robustness of
three popular bandit algorithms: UCB, $\varepsilon$-Greedy, and Thompson
Sampling. We prove that all three algorithms achieve a regret upper bound
$\mathcal{O}(\max \{ B, K\ln T\})$ where $B$ is the total budget across arms,
$K$ is the total number of arms and $T$ is length of the time horizon. This
regret guarantee holds under \emph{arbitrary adaptive} manipulation strategy of
arms. Our second set of main results shows that this regret bound is
\emph{tight} -- in fact for UCB it is tight even when we restrict the arms'
manipulation strategies to form a \emph{Nash equilibrium}. The lower bound
makes use of a simple manipulation strategy, the same for all three algorithms,
yielding a bound of $\Omega(\max \{ B, K\ln T\})$. Our results illustrate the
robustness of classic bandits algorithms against strategic manipulations as

that of Frieze and Johansson (2018), finding $k$ MSTs of combined minimum

  Our results also hold (and mostly are derived) in a multigraph model where
edge weights for each vertex pair follow a Poisson process; here we
additionally have $\mathbb E(w(T_k)) \to \gamma_k$. Thinking of an edge of

$F_k(t)$, each initially empty and eventually equal to $T_k$, with each
arriving edge added to the first $F_k(t)$ where it does not create a cycle.
Using tools of inhomogeneous random graphs we obtain structural results
including that $C_1(F_k(t))/n$, the fraction of vertices in the largest
component of $F_k(t)$, converges in probability to a function $\rho_k(t)$,
uniformly for all $t$, and that a giant component appears in $F_k(t)$ at a time
$t=\sigma_k$. We conjecture that the functions $\rho_k$ tend to time
translations of a single function, $\rho_k(2k+x)\to\rho_\infty(x)$ as $k \to
\infty$, uniformly in $x\in \mathbb R$.
  Simulations and numerical computations give estimated values of $\gamma_k$
for small $k$, and support the conjectures just stated.

  Analysis of Neural Language Models and Brains",,"2nd BlackBoxNLP workshop @ACL2019",,,"cs.AI cs.CL q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we define and apply representational stability analysis
(ReStA), an intuitive way of analyzing neural language models. ReStA is a
variant of the popular representational similarity analysis (RSA) in cognitive
neuroscience. While RSA can be used to compare representations in models, model
components, and human brains, ReStA compares instances of the same model, while
systematically varying single model parameter. Using ReStA, we study four
recent and successful neural language models, and evaluate how sensitive their
internal representations are to the amount of prior context. Using RSA, we
perform a systematic study of how similar the representational spaces in the
first and second (or higher) layers of these models are to each other and to
patterns of activation in the human brain. Our results reveal surprisingly
strong differences between language models, and give insights into where the
deep linguistic processing, that integrates information over multiple
sentences, is happening in these models. The combination of ReStA and RSA on
models and brains allows us to start addressing the important question of what
kind of linguistic processes we can hope to observe in fMRI brain imaging data.
In particular, our results suggest that the data on story reading from Wehbe et
al. (2014) contains a signal of shallow linguistic processing, but show no
evidence on the more interesting deep linguistic processing.

available and the generated maps are usually sensor setup specific. Global
Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) can overcome this problem. However, they
are not always reliable especially in urban areas due to multi-path and
shadowing effects. Since aerial imagery is usually available, we can use it as
prior information. To match aerial images with grid maps, we use conditional
Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) which transform aerial images to the
grid map domain. The transformation between the predicted and measured grid map
is estimated using a localization network (LocNet). Given the geo-referenced
aerial image transformation the vehicle pose can be estimated. Evaluations
performed on the data recorded in region Karlsruhe, Germany show that our
LocGAN approach provides reliable global localization results.

written by undirected and untrained annotators. Free-form labeling is natural
for annotators, they intuitively provide very specific and exhaustive labels,
and no training stage is necessary. We first collect 729 labels on 15k images
using 124 different annotators. Then we automatically enrich the structure of
these free-form annotations by discovering a natural vocabulary of 4020 classes
within them. This vocabulary represents the natural distribution of objects
well and is learned directly from data, instead of being an educated guess done
before collecting any labels. Hence, the natural vocabulary emerges from a
large mass of free-form annotations. To do so, we (i) map the raw input strings
to entities in an ontology of physical objects (which gives them an unambiguous
meaning); and (ii) leverage inter-annotator co-occurrences, as well as biases
and knowledge specific to individual annotators. Finally, we also automatically
extract natural vocabularies of reduced size that have high object coverage
while remaining specific. These reduced vocabularies represent the natural
distribution of objects much better than commonly used predefined vocabularies.
Moreover, they feature more uniform sample distribution over classes.

  Methodology","15 pages, 1 embedded figure, 34 references",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As biomedical sciences discover new layers of complexity in the mechanisms of
life and disease, mathematical models trying to catch up with these
developments become mathematically intractable. As a result, in the grand
scheme of things, mathematical models have so far played an auxiliary role in
biomedical sciences. We propose a new methodology allowing mathematical
modeling to give, in certain cases, definitive answers to systemic biomedical
questions that elude empirical resolution. Our methodology is based on two
ideas: (1) employing mathematical models that are firmly rooted in established
biomedical knowledge yet so general that they can account for any, or at least
many, biological mechanisms, both known and unknown; (2) finding model
parameters whose likelihood-maximizing values are independent of observations
(existence of such parameters implies that the model must not meet regularity
conditions required for the consistency of maximum likelihood estimator). These
universal parameter values may reveal general patterns (that we call natural
laws) in biomedical processes. We illustrate this approach with the discovery
of a clinically important natural law governing cancer metastasis.
Specifically, we found that under minimal, and fairly realistic, mathematical
and biomedical assumptions the likelihood-maximizing scenario of metastatic
cancer progression in an individual patient is invariably the same: Complete
suppression of metastatic growth before primary tumor resection followed by an
abrupt growth acceleration after surgery. This scenario is widely observed in
clinical practice and supported by a wealth of experimental studies on animals
and clinical case reports published over the last 110 years. The above most
likely scenario does not preclude other possibilities e.g. metastases may start
aggressive growth before primary tumor resection or remain dormant after
surgery.

supervised semantic segmentation task, our approach learns about interactions
by watching videos of real human behavior and anticipating afforded actions.
Given a novel image or video, our model infers a spatial hotspot map indicating
how an object would be manipulated in a potential interaction, even if the
object is currently at rest. Through results with both first and third person
video, we show the value of grounding affordances in real human-object
interactions. Not only are our weakly supervised hotspots competitive with
strongly supervised affordance methods, but they can also anticipate object

FELs that rely on Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE), and this involves
increasing simulation activity in the design, optimization, and
characterization of these x-ray FELs. Most of the simulation codes in use rely
on the Slowly-Varying Envelope Approximation (SVEA) in which Maxwell's
equations are averaged over the fast time scale resulting in relatively small
computational requirements. While the SVEA codes are generally successful, the
predictions of these codes sometimes differ in various aspects of the FEL
interaction. In contrast, Particle-in-Cell (PiC) simulation codes do not
average Maxwell's equations and are considered to be a more complete model of
the underlying physics.Unfortunately, they require much longer run times than
SVEA codes and have not been validated by comparison with experiment as often
as the SVEA codes. In order to remedy this, and to resolve issues that arise
due to different predictions between the SVEA codes, we present a comparison
between one SVEA code (MINERVA) and a PiC simulation code (PUFFIN) with the
experimental measurements obtained at the SPARC SASE FEL experiment at ENEA
Frascati. The results show good agreement between the two codes and between the

common elements, this validates both formulations and demonstrates the
capability to model the FEL interaction from the start of teh undulator through

recommendations, but they are also notoriously difficult to explain. In this
work, we integrate regression trees to guide the learning of latent factor
models for recommendation, and use the learnt tree structure to explain the
resulting latent factors. Specifically, we build regression trees on users and
items respectively with user-generated reviews, and associate a latent profile
to each node on the trees to represent users and items. With the growth of
regression tree, the latent factors are gradually refined under the
regularization imposed by the tree structure. As a result, we are able to track
the creation of latent profiles by looking into the path of each factor on
regression trees, which thus serves as an explanation for the resulting
recommendations. Extensive experiments on two large collections of Amazon and
Yelp reviews demonstrate the advantage of our model over several competitive
baseline algorithms. Besides, our extensive user study also confirms the
practical value of explainable recommendations generated by our model.

the failure of fan or compressor blade in turbojet engines. In Ultra High
Bypass Ratio (UHBR) fan, the choke flutter appears at part speed regimes and at
low or negative incidence when a strong shock-wave chokes the blade to blade
channel. Localization of main excitation sources and the understanding of the
different work exchange mechanisms will help to avoid deficient and dangerous

using a time-linearized Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equation solver to
investigate the choke flutter. The steady state and the imposed vibration
(inter blade phase angle, reduced frequency and mode shape) are selected to be
in choke flutter situation. Superposition principle induced by the
linearization allow to decompose the blade in numerous small subsections to
track the contribution of each local vibration to the global damping. All
simulations have been performed on a 2D blade to blade extraction. Findings
:Result analysis points to a restricted number of excitation sources at the
trailing edge which induce a large part of the work exchange in a limited
region of the airfoil. Main phenomena suspected are the shock-wave motion and
the shock-wave/boundary layer interaction. Originality/value :An original
excitation source tracking methodology allowed by the linearized calculation is
addressed and applied to a UHBR fan test-case.

approaches are confronting remarkable challenges in designing low complexity
high accuracy decoding algorithm and constructing optimum codebooks.
Fortunately, the recent spotlighted deep learning technologies are of

Inspired by this, we explore approaches to improve SCMA performances with the
help of deep learning methods. We propose and train a deep neural network (DNN)
called DL-SCMA to learn to decode SCMA modulated signals corrupted by additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Putting encoding and decoding together, an
autoencoder called AE-SCMA is established and trained to generate optimal SCMA
codewords and reconstruct original bits. Furthermore, by manipulating the
mapping vectors, an autoencoder is able to generalize SCMA, thus a dense code
multiple access (DCMA) scheme is proposed. Simulations show that the DNN SCMA
decoder significantly outperforms the conventional message passing algorithm
(MPA) in terms of bit error rate (BER), symbol error rate (SER) and
computational complexity, and AE-SCMA also demonstrates better performances via
constructing better SCMA codebooks. The performance of deep learning aided DCMA

language$\lambda$Prolog by compiling programs into bytecode for an abstract
machine and executing this translated form using a simulator for the machine.
Teyjus supports a number of builtin relations that are realized through C code.
In the current scheme, these relations are realized by including the C programs
that implement them within the simulator and tailoring the compiler to produce
instructions to invoke such code. There are two drawbacks to such an approach.
First, the entire collection of library functions must be included within the
system, thereby leading to a larger than necessary memory footprint. Second,
enhancing the collection of built-in predicates requires changing parts of the
simulator and compiler, a task whose accomplishment requires specific knowledge
of these two subsystems. This project addresses these problems in three steps.
First, the code for the builtin functions is moved from the simulator into a
library from where relevant parts, determined by information in the bytecode
file, are linked into the runtime system at load time. Second, information is
associated with each library function about how it can be invoked from a
$\lambda$Prolog program and where the C code for it is to be found. Finally,
the compiler is modified to use the preceding information to include relevant
linking instructions in the bytecode file and to translate invocations to
builtin relations into a special instruction that calls the dynamically linked
code. More generally, these ideas are capable of supporting an interface in
$\lambda$Prolog to ""foreign functions"" implemented in C, a possibility that is
also discussed.

the usual Wheeler-DeWitt term and the term with the time derivative of the wave

representing OWL complex classes in AutomationML, and present algorithms for
the bidirectional translation between OWL complex classes and their
corresponding AML concept models. We show that this approach provides an
efficient and intuitive interface for nonexperts to visualize, modify, and
create OWL complex classes.

exploration of a large configuration space. For real-world control cabinets it
is impractical to evaluate all possible cabinet configurations. Therefore, we
need to apply methods for intelligent exploration of cabinet configuration
space that enable to find a near-optimal configuration without evaluation of
all possible configurations. In this paper, we describe an approach for
multi-objective optimization of control cabinet layout that is based on Pareto
Simulated Annealing. Optimization aims at minimizing the total wire length used
for interconnection of components and the heat convection within the cabinet.
We simulate heat convection to study the warm air flow within the control
cabinet and determine the optimal position of components that generate heat
during the operation. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach empirically for various control cabinet sizes and usage scenarios.

electromagnetic scattering problems with phaseless total-field data at a fixed
frequency. Motivated by our previous work ({\em SIAM J. Appl. Math. \bf78}
(2018), 1737-1753), where uniqueness results were proved for inverse acoustic
scattering with phaseless far-field data generated by superpositions of two
plane waves as the incident waves at a fixed frequency, in this paper, we use
superpositions of two point sources as the incident fields at a fixed frequency
and measure the modulus of the acoustic total-field (called phaseless acoustic
near-field data) on two spheres enclosing the scatterers generated by such
incident fields on the two spheres. Based on this idea, we prove that the
impenetrable bounded obstacle or the index of refraction of an inhomogeneous
medium can be uniquely determined from the phaseless acoustic near-field data
at a fixed frequency. Moreover, the idea is also extended to the
electromagnetic case, and it is proved that the impenetrable bounded obstacle
or the index of refraction of an inhomogeneous medium can be uniquely
determined by the phaseless electric near-field data at a fixed frequency, that
is, the modulus of the tangential component with the orientations $\mathbf
e_\phi$ and $\mathbf e_\theta$, respectively, of the electric total-field
measured on a sphere enclosing the scatters and generated by superpositions of
two electric dipoles at a fixed frequency located on the measurement sphere and
another bigger sphere with the polarization vectors $\mathbf e_\phi$ and
$\mathbf e_\theta$, respectively. As far as we know, this is the first
uniqueness result for three-dimensional inverse electromagnetic scattering with
phaseless near-field data.

Like other artificial intelligence techniques, evolutionary algorithms will
likely see increased use and development due to the increased availability of
computation, more robust and available open source software libraries, and the
increasing demand for artificial intelligence techniques. As these techniques
become more adopted and capable, it is the right time to take a perspective of
their ability to integrate into society and the human processes they intend to
augment. In this review, we explore a new taxonomy of evolutionary algorithms
and resulting classifications that look at five main areas: the ability to
manage the control of the environment with limiters, the ability to explain and
repeat the search process, the ability to understand input and output causality
within a solution, the ability to manage algorithm bias due to data or user
design, and lastly, the ability to add corrective measures. These areas are
motivated by today's pressures on industry to conform to both societies
concerns and new government regulatory rules. As many reviews of evolutionary
algorithms exist, after motivating this new taxonomy, we briefly classify a
broad range of algorithms and identify areas of future research.

presence of delivery vehicles in order to implement intelligent city planning

information about their category, model or trajectory. This paper proposes a
Deep Learning tool for classifying vehicles in a given image while considering
different categories of logistic vehicles, namely: light-duty, medium-duty and
heavy-duty vehicles. The proposed approach yields two main contributions: first
we developed an architecture to create an annotated and balanced database of
logistic vehicles, reducing manual annotation efforts. Second, we built a
classifier that accurately classifies the logistic vehicles passing through a
given road. The results of this work are: first, a database of 72 000 images
for 4 vehicles classes; and second two retrained convolutional neural networks
