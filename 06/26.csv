first (off) the output is shut off and the workload accumulates. This continues
until some stopping time. In the second (on), the process evolves like a
subordinator minus a positive drift (output rate) until it hits the origin. In
addition, we assume that the output rate of every on period is a random
variable which is determined at the beginning of this period. For example, at
each period, the output rate may depend on the workload level at the beginning
of the corresponding busy period. We derive the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of
the steady state distribution of the workload process and then apply this
result to solve a steady-state cost minimization problem with holding, setup

nondecreasing deterministic function of the workload level at the beginning of
the corresponding on period.

content, a minimalistic set of parameters such as prosodic, excitation, vocal
tract, and spectral descriptors are used as features. The fusion of these two

each modality. The proposed approach also includes preprocessing and
post-processing techniques which contribute favorably to improving the
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). Experimental results for predicting
spontaneous and natural emotions on the RECOLA dataset have shown that the

the introduction of a small viscosity in a sub-Keplerian flow, much like the
wind accretion in HMXBs such as Cir X-1, only a single Normal Boundary Layer

viscosity, the region extends radially and beyond some critical value, a
RAdiative KEplerian Disk/layer (RAKED) forms between the sub-Keplerian flow and
the NBOL. When viscosity is increased further only NBOL and RAKED remain. In
all such cases, the CENtrifugal pressure dominated BOundary Layer (CENBOL) is
formed, away from the star, as in the case of black holes. This is the first
self-consistent study where such a transition from sub-Keplerian flows has been
reported for neutron stars. We also identify the connection between accretion

Nonetheless, the intertwining between electronic correlation and lattice

Peierls distortion. Here, we suggest that this problem is in fact ill-posed:
the electronic correlations and the lattice vibrations conspire to stabilise
the monoclinic insulator, and so they must be both considered not to miss
relevant pieces of the VO$_2$ physics. Specifically, we design a minimal model
for VO$_2$ that includes all the important physical ingredients: the electronic
correlations, the multi-orbital character, and the two components
antiferrodistortive mode that condenses in the monoclinic insulator. We solve
this model by dynamical mean-field theory within the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer
approximation. Consistently with the first-order character of the
metal-insulator transition, the Born-Oppenheimer potential has a rich
landscape, with minima corresponding to the undistorted phase and to the four
equivalent distorted ones, and which translates into an equally rich
thermodynamics that we uncover by the Monte Carlo method. Remarkably, we find
that a distorted metal phase intrudes between the low-temperature distorted
insulator and high-temperature undistorted metal, which sheds new light on the
debated experimental evidence of a monoclinic metallic phase.

on one copy of each type whose outcome probability is a linear function of the
squared overlap. We show that a more precise estimate can be obtained by
allowing for general collective measurements on all copies. We derive the
statistics of the optimal measurement and compute the optimal mean square error
in the asymptotic pointwise and finite Bayesian estimation settings. Besides,
we consider two strategies relying on the estimation of one or both the states,

particular, the swap test is extremely inefficient for small values of the

Decomposition problems have been studied extensively for a variety of different
sequences and notions of a legal decompositions; for the Fibonacci numbers, a
legal decomposition is one for which each summand is used at most once and no
two consecutive summands may be chosen. Recently, Chen et al. [CCGJMSY]
generalized earlier work to $d$-dimensional lattices of positive integers;
there, a legal decomposition is a path such that every point chosen had each
component strictly less than the component of the previous chosen point in the
path. They were able to prove Gaussianity results despite the lack of
uniqueness of the decompositions; however, their results should hold in the
more general case where some components are identical. The strictly decreasing
assumption was needed in that work to obtain simple, closed form combinatorial
expressions, which could then be well approximated and led to the limiting
behavior. In this work we remove that assumption through inclusion-exclusion
arguments. These lead to more involved combinatorial sums; using generating
functions and recurrence relations we obtain tractable forms in $2$ dimensions
and prove Gaussianity again; a more involved analysis should work in higher
dimensions.

edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 4013. Supplementary LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) data
at 150MHz are used to study the low-frequency properties of this galaxy and
X-ray (Chandra, XMM-Newton) data are used to investigate the central region.
The central point source dominates the radio continuum in both CHANG-ES bands,
but no clear AGN classification is possible at this time. The scale height
analysis shows that Gaussian fits, with halo scale heights of 1.2 kpc in
C-band, 2.0 kpc in L-band, and 3.1 kpc at 150 MHz, better represent the
intensity profiles than do exponential fits. The radio continuum halo of NGC
4013 in C-band is rather small, while the low-frequency LOFAR data reveal a
large halo. The polarization data reveal plane-parallel, regular magnetic
fields within the entire disk and vertical halo components out to heights of
about 6 kpc indicating the presence of an axisymmetric field having a radial
component pointing outwards. The mean magnetic field strength of the disk of
NGC 4013 of 6.6 $\mu$G (using the revised equipartition formula) is rather
small. The interaction and the low star formation rate (SFR) across the disk of
NGC 4013 probably influence the appearance of its radio continuum. Several
observable quantities give consistent evidence that the CR transport in the
halo of NGC 4013 is diffusive: the frequency dependence of the synchrotron
scale height, the disk/halo flux density ratio, the vertical profile of the
synchrotron spectral index, the small propagation speed measured modeled with
spinnaker, and the low temperature of the X-ray emitting hot gas.

features that a person can directly understand. Recently, methods relying on
visual feature prototypes have been developed for this purpose. However, in
contrast to how humans categorize objects, these approaches have not yet made
use of any taxonomical organization of class labels. With such an approach, for
instance, we may see why a chimpanzee is classified as a chimpanzee, but not
why it was considered to be a primate or even an animal. In this work we
introduce a model that uses hierarchically organized prototypes to classify
objects at every level in a predefined taxonomy. Hence, we may find distinct
explanations for the prediction an image receives at each level of the
taxonomy. The hierarchical prototypes enable the model to perform another
important task: interpretably classifying images from previously unseen classes
at the level of the taxonomy to which they correctly relate, e.g. classifying a
hand gun as a weapon, when the only weapons in the training data are rifles.
With a subset of ImageNet, we test our model against its counterpart black-box
model on two tasks: 1) classification of data from familiar classes, and 2)
classification of data from previously unseen classes at the appropriate level
in the taxonomy. We find that our model performs approximately as well as its
counterpart black-box model while allowing for each classification to be
interpreted.

Often, this is addressed in the context of hierarchical reinforcement learning,

given situation. However, the meta-policy must still produce appropriate
decisions in all states. In this work, we propose a policy design that
decomposes into primitives, similarly to hierarchical reinforcement learning,
but without a high-level meta-policy. Instead, each primitive can decide for
themselves whether they wish to act in the current state. We use an
information-theoretic mechanism for enabling this decentralized decision: each
primitive chooses how much information it needs about the current state to make
a decision and the primitive that requests the most information about the
current state acts in the world. The primitives are regularized to use as
little information as possible, which leads to natural competition and

large thickness values might result in self-intersections on the inner boundary

explainability. Given a classification result from a model, it is typically
hard to determine what caused the decision to be made, and to give an
informative explanation. We explore a new method of generating counterfactual
explanations, which instead of explaining why a particular classification was
made explain how a different outcome can be achieved. This gives the recipients
of the explanation a better way to understand the outcome, and provides an
actionable suggestion. We show that the introduced method of Constrained
Adversarial Examples (CADEX) can be used in real world applications, and yields
explanations which incorporate business or domain constraints such as handling
categorical attributes and range constraints.

This requires the probability of the possible model decisions to be independent
of the sensitive information. We argue that the goal of imposing demographic
parity can be substantially facilitated within a multitask learning setting. We
leverage task similarities by encouraging a shared fair representation across
the tasks via low rank matrix factorization. We derive learning bounds
establishing that the learned representation transfers well to novel tasks both

contributions to the fracture process are modeled separately and a thickness
integration is established for the latter. The coupled system consists of two
nonlinear fourth-order PDEs and all quantities are defined on an evolving
two-dimensional manifold. Since the weak form requires $C^1$-continuity,
isogeometric shape functions are used. The mesh is adaptively refined based on
the phase field using Locally Refinable (LR) NURBS. Time is discretized based
on a generalized-$\alpha$ method using adaptive time-stepping, and the
discretized coupled system is solved with a monolithic Newton-Raphson scheme.
The interaction between surface deformation and crack evolution is demonstrated

from colloids interacting with simple pair interactions. To circumvent these
problems, one can self-assemble both structures in a closely packed MgCu2 Laves
phase from a binary mixture of colloidal spheres and then selectively remove
one of the sublattices. Although Laves phases have been proven to be stable in
a binary hard-sphere system, they have never been observed to spontaneously
crystallize in such a fluid mixture in simulations nor in experiments of
micron-sized hard spheres due to slow dynamics. Here we demonstrate, using
computer simulations, that softness in the interparticle potential suppresses
the degree of fivefold symmetry in the binary fluid phase and enhances

allows us to characterize the algebra beyond the MHV sector. This allows us to
both constrain some of the ambiguities of the kinematic algebra, and better
control the generalized gauge freedom that is associated with the BCJ

dimensions compute the next-to-MHV sector involving two scalars. The kinematic
algebra in this sector is simple, given that we introduce tensor currents that
generalize standard Yang-Mills vector currents. These tensor currents controls
the generalized gauge freedom, allowing us to generate multiple different

produce ever larger structures. During these merger processes, the smaller halo
can potentially survive as a subhalo of the larger halo, so a galaxy-scale halo
today likely possesses a rich abundance of substructure. This substructure can
greatly boost the rate of dark matter annihilation within the host halo, but
the precise magnitude of this boost is clouded by uncertainty about the
survival prospects of these subhalos. In particular, tidal forces gradually
strip material from the subhalos, reducing their annihilation signals and
potentially destroying them. In this work, we use high-resolution idealized
$N$-body simulations to develop and tune a model that can predict the impact of
this tidal evolution on the annihilation rates within subhalos. This model
predicts the time evolution of a subhalo's annihilation rate as a function of
three physically motivated parameters of the host-subhalo system: the energy
injected into subhalo particles per orbit about the host, the ratio of
stretching to compressive tidal forces, and the radial distribution of tidal
heating within the subhalo. Our model will improve the accuracy of predictions
of the magnitude and morphology of annihilation signals from dark matter
substructure. Additionally, our parametrization can describe the time evolution
of other subhalo properties, so it has implications for understanding aspects

relative anomalies between different symmetry fractionalization classes of a

symmetries. We demonstrate compatibility of the relative anomaly formula with
previous results for diagnosing anomalies for $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\bf T}$ space-time

mixed anomalies for $U(1) \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\bf T}$ and $U(1) \rtimes

filaments along which nearly all halos with M_v>10^9M_{sun} are located. This
sheet collapses at z~5 from the merger of two smaller sheets. The strong shock
generated by this merger leads to thermal instabilities in the post-shock
region, and to a shattering of the sheet resulting in <~kpc scale clouds with
temperatures of T>~2x10^4K and densities of n>~10^{-3}cm^{-3}, which are
pressure confined in a hot medium with T~10^6K and n>~10^{-5}cm^{-3}. When the
sheet is viewed face on, these cold clouds have neutral hydrogen column
densities of N_{HI}>10^{17.2}cm^{-2}, making them detectable as Lyman limit
systems, though they lie well outside the virial radius of any halo and even
well outside the dense filaments. Their chemical composition is pristine,
having zero metalicity, similar to several recently observed systems. Since
these systems form far from any galaxies, these results are robust to galaxy
formation physics, resulting purely from the collapse of large scale structure

the estimate of MHOU encoded in the next-to-leading order (NLO) theory
covariance matrix to the observed shifts between NLO and NNLO predictions. We
perform a NLO PDF determination which includes the MHOU, assess the impact of
the inclusion of MHOUs on the PDF central values and uncertainties, and
validate the results by comparison to the known shift between NLO and NNLO
PDFs. We finally study the impact of the inclusion of MHOUs in a global PDF
determination on LHC cross-sections, and provide guidelines for their use in
precision phenomenology. In addition, we also compare the results based on the

potential source for the detected polarisation signal. We calculate the
wavelength dependent absorption and intrinsic polarisation of spheroidally

porosity which appears to be present in disks when small grains coagulate to
form larger aggregates. For the first time our results show that (a) the
intrinsic polarisation decreases for increasing grain porosity and (b) the
polarisation orientation flips by 90 degree for certain ratios of wavelength to
grain size. We present a new method to constrain grain porosity and the grain
size in protoplanetary disks using multi-wavelength polarisation observations
in the far-infrared to millimetre wavelengths. Finally, we find that moderate
grain porosities ($\mathcal{P}\lesssim0.7$) potentially explain the observed

hypothesis (ETH). However, strong disorder can destroy ergodicity through
many-body localization (MBL) -- at least in one dimensional systems -- leading
to a clear signal of the MBL transition in the probability distributions of
energy eigenstate expectation values of local operators. For a paradigmatic
model of MBL, namely the random-field Heisenberg spin chain, we consider the
full probability distribution of eigenstate correlation functions across the

predicted by pure ETH. At intermediate disorder -- in the thermal phase -- we
find further evidence for anomalous thermalization in the form of heavy tails
of the distributions. In the MBL phase, we observe peculiar features of the
correlator distributions: a strong asymmetry in $S_i^z S_{i+r}^z$ correlators
skewed towards negative values; and a multimodal distribution for spin-flip
correlators. A quantitative quasi-degenerate perturbation theory calculation of
these correlators yields a surprising agreement of the full distribution with
the exact results, revealing, in particular, the origin of the multiple peaks
in the spin-flip correlator distribution as arising from the resonant and
off-resonant admixture of spin configurations. The distribution of the
$S_i^zS_{i+r}^z$ correlator exhibits striking differences between the MBL and

to their interactions with material bodies - encode very little of that
geometry: It is shown here that any given configuration is compatible with a
very large variety of spacetime metrics. For scalar fields in geometric optics,
or observables which are not sensitive to the detailed polarization content of
electromagnetic or gravitational waves, seven of the ten metric components are
essentially irrelevant. With polarization, five components are irrelevant. In
the former case, this result together with diffeomorphism invariance allows
essentially any geometric-optics configuration associated with a particular
spacetime to be embedded into any other spacetime, at least in finite regions.
Going beyond the geometric-optics approximation breaks some of this degeneracy,
although much remains even then. Overall, high-frequency wave propagation is
shown to be insensitive to compositions of certain conformal, Kerr-Schild, and
related transformations of the background metric. One application is that new
solutions for scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational waves may be generated
from old ones. In one example described here, the high-frequency scattering of
a plane wave by a point mass is computed by transforming a plane wave in flat
spacetime.

super Yang-Mills theories in $D=(8n+3)+3$ via the so-called Magic Star
algebras. A particularly interesting case occurs in signature $D=27+3$, where
the superalgebra is centrally extended by an electric 11-brane and its 15-brane
magnetic dual. The worldvolume symmetry of the 11-brane has signature $D=11+3$
and can reproduce super Yang-Mills theory in $D=11+3$. Upon reduction to
$D=26+2$, the 11-brane reduces to a 10-brane with $10+2$ worldvolume signature.
A single time projection gives a $10+1$ worldvolume signature and can serve as
a model for $D=10+1$ M-theory as a reduction from the $D=26+1$ signature of the
bosonic M-theory of Horowitz and Susskind; this is further confirmed by the
reduction of chiral $(1,0)$, $D=11+3$ superalgebra to the $\mathcal{N}=1$
superalgebra in $D=10+1$, as found by Rudychev, Sezgin and Sundell some time
ago. Extending previous results of Dijkgraaf, Verlinde and Verlinde, we also
put forward the realization of spinors as total cohomologies of (the largest
spatially extended) branes which centrally extend the $(1,0)$ superalgebra
underlying the corresponding exceptional super Yang-Mills theory. Moreover, by
making use of an ""anomalous"" Dynkin embedding, we strengthen Ramond and Sati's
argument that M-theory has hidden Cayley plane fibers.

black holes (BHs) and to be dominated by supernova feedback. However, recent
studies suggest that BH feedback could also strongly impact their growth. We
report the discovery of 35 dwarf galaxies hosting radio AGN out to redshift
$\sim$3.4, which constitutes the highest-redshift sample of AGN in dwarf
galaxies. The galaxies are drawn from the VLA-COSMOS 3 GHz Large Project and
all are star-forming. After removing the contribution from star formation to
the radio emission, we find a range of AGN radio luminosities of
$L^\mathrm{AGN}_\mathrm{1.4 GHz} \sim 10^{37}$-$10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The
bolometric luminosities derived from the fit of their spectral energy
distribution are $\gtrsim 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, in agreement with the presence
of AGN in these dwarf galaxies. The 3 GHz radio emission of most of the sources
is compact and the jet powers range from $Q_\mathrm{jet} \sim 10^{42}$ to
10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. These values, as well as the finding of jet
efficiencies $\geq 10$ \% in more than 50\% of the sample, indicate that dwarf
galaxies can host radio jets as powerful as those of massive radio galaxies
whose jet mechanical feedback can strongly affect the formation of stars in the
host galaxy. We conclude that AGN feedback can also have a very strong impact
on dwarf galaxies, either triggering or hampering star formation and possibly
the material available for BH growth. This implies that those low-mass AGN
hosted in dwarf galaxies might not be the untouched relics of the early seed
BHs, which has important implications for seed BH formation models.

holes and two-dimensional conformal field theory on the thermofield double

shock wave. Following Gao, Jafferis and Wall [1], we show that the negative
energy shock wave is dual to the infinite boost limit of a specific double
trace deformation which couples the left and right CFTs. We spell out the
mechanism of information transfer through traversable BTZ wormholes, treating
the backreaction of the message as a positive energy shockwave. The
corresponding spacetime is that of colliding spherical shells in the BTZ black
hole, which we explicitly construct. This construction allows us to obtain a
bound on the amount of information that can be sent through the wormhole, which
is consistent with previous work in the context of nearly $AdS_2$ gravity [2].
Consequently, we define a notion of traversibility of the wormhole and study it
in the context of a multiple shock geometry. We argue that the time-dependence
of traversibility in this geometry can be connected to certain aspects of the
black hole evaporation process, such as the second half of the Page curve.
Finally, we examine the claim that traversable wormholes are fast decoders. We
find evidence for this by computing the scrambling time in the shockwave
background and showing that it is delayed by the presence of the negative
energy shock wave.

Even for simple tasks, a detailed understanding of how recurrent networks work,
or a prescription for how to develop such an understanding, remains elusive. In
this work, we use tools from dynamical systems analysis to reverse engineer
recurrent networks trained to perform sentiment classification, a foundational
natural language processing task. Given a trained network, we find fixed points
of the recurrent dynamics and linearize the nonlinear system around these fixed
points. Despite their theoretical capacity to implement complex,
high-dimensional computations, we find that trained networks converge to highly
interpretable, low-dimensional representations. In particular, the topological
structure of the fixed points and corresponding linearized dynamics reveal an
approximate line attractor within the RNN, which we can use to quantitatively
understand how the RNN solves the sentiment analysis task. Finally, we find
this mechanism present across RNN architectures (including LSTMs, GRUs, and
vanilla RNNs) trained on multiple datasets, suggesting that our findings are
not unique to a particular architecture or dataset. Overall, these results
demonstrate that surprisingly universal and human interpretable computations

  Discussion, Section 4 rewritten for clarity, some citations added",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is known that the classical framework of causal models is not general
enough to allow for causal reasoning about quantum systems. While the framework
has been generalized in a variety of different ways to the quantum case, much
of this work leaves open whether causal concepts are fundamental to quantum
theory, or only find application at an emergent level of classical devices and
measurement outcomes. Here, we present a framework of quantum causal models,
with causal relations defined in terms intrinsic to quantum theory, and the
central object of study being the quantum process itself. Following Allen et
al., Phys. Rev. X 7, 031021 (2017), the approach defines quantum causal
relations in terms of unitary evolution, in a way analogous to an approach to
classical causal models that assumes underlying determinism and situates causal
relations in functional dependences between variables. We show that any unitary
quantum circuit has a causal structure corresponding to a directed acyclic
graph, and that when marginalising over local noise sources, the resulting
quantum process satisfies a Markov condition with respect to the graph. We also
prove a converse to this statement. We introduce an intrinsically quantum
notion that plays a role analogous to the conditional independence of classical
variables, and (generalizing a central theorem of the classical framework) show
that d-separation is sound and complete for it in the quantum case. We present
generalizations of the three rules of the classical do-calculus, in each case
relating a property of the causal structure to a formal property of the quantum
process, and to an operational statement concerning the outcomes of
interventions. In addition, we introduce and derive similar results for

we fabricate Au/Ti/TiOx/MoS2 samples as well as Au/Ti/MoS2 and Au/TiOx/MoS2 for
comparison. Elemental titanium reacts strongly with MoS2 whereas no interface
reactions are observed in the two types of samples containing TiOx/MoS2
interfaces. Using time domain thermoreflectance for the measurement of thermal
boundary conductance, we find that samples contacted with Ti and a thin TiOx
layer at the interface (less than or equal to 1.5 nm) exhibit the same behavior
as samples contacted solely with pure Ti. The Au/TiOx/MoS2 samples exhibit
approximately 20% lower thermal boundary conductance, despite having the same
MoS2 interface chemistry as the samples with thin oxide at the Ti/MoS2
interface. We identify the mechanism for this phenomenon, attributing it to the
different interfaces with the top Au contact. Our work demonstrates that the
use of thin interfacial oxide layers to reduce electrical contact resistance
does not compromise heat flow in 2D electronic devices. We note that the
thicknesses of the Ti and TiOx layers must be considered for optimal thermal

large reflecting surface (LRS), which consists of an array of reflector
elements with adjustable reflection phases. By knowing the phase shifts induced
by the composite propagation channels through the LRS, the phases of the
reflectors can be configured such that the signals combine coherently at the
destination, which improves the communication performance. However, perfect
phase estimation or high-precision configuration of the reflection phases is
unfeasible. In this paper, we study the transmission through an LRS with phase
errors that have a generic distribution. We show that the LRS-based composite
channel is equivalent to a point-to-point Nakagami fading channel. This
equivalent representation allows for theoretical analysis of the performance
and can help the system designer study the interplay between performance, the
distribution of phase errors, and the number of reflectors. Numerical
evaluation of the error probability for a limited number of reflectors confirms
the theoretical prediction and shows that the performance is remarkably robust
against the phase errors.

It is argued that the latter approach is inherently circular and physically
misguided. The typicality approach has engendered a deep-seated confusion
between contingent and law-like features, leading to misleading claims not only
about the Born rule but also about the nature of the wave function. By
artificially restricting the theory to equilibrium, the typicality approach has
led to further misunderstandings concerning the status of the uncertainty
principle, the role of quantum measurement theory, and the kinematics of the
theory (including the status of Galilean and Lorentz invariance). The
restriction to equilibrium has also made an erroneously-constructed stochastic
model of particle creation appear more plausible than it actually is. To avoid
needless controversy, we advocate a modest 'empirical approach' to the

understanding of both the visual content of images and the textual content of

key words in questions with key objects in images is central to VQA
performance. So far, most successful attempts at co-attention learning have
been achieved by using shallow models, and deep co-attention models show little
improvement over their shallow counterparts. In this paper, we propose a deep
Modular Co-Attention Network (MCAN) that consists of Modular Co-Attention (MCA)
layers cascaded in depth. Each MCA layer models the self-attention of questions
and images, as well as the guided-attention of images jointly using a modular
composition of two basic attention units. We quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluate MCAN on the benchmark VQA-v2 dataset and conduct extensive ablation
studies to explore the reasons behind MCAN's effectiveness. Experimental
results demonstrate that MCAN significantly outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art. Our best single model delivers 70.63$\%$ overall accuracy on

way that any solution to either point-cloud registration or to Wahba's problem

solutions: classic Horn's optimal quaternion method, Optimal Linear Attitude
Estimator (OLAE) that efficiently recovers the optimal Gibbs-Rodrigues vector
solving a small linear system, and an iterative non-linear Gauss-Newton solver.
Special care is given to explain how to overcome the Gibbs vector singularity

transformation scale mismatches. The approach also allows the introduction of
per-primitive relative weights, including an optional robust loss function that
is applicable only if an initial guess for the solution is known in advance.

algebra structures, both satisfying the required property to be a Lie
algebroid. We may then apply a {construction} by Marle to obtain a Poisson
bracket on the set of smooth real or complex valued functions on $M\times

set of examples include the standard Darboux symplectic structure and the
classical Lie Poisson brackets, but is a strictly larger class of Poisson
brackets than these. Our study includes the associated Hamiltonian flows and
their invariants, canonical maps induced by the Lie group action, and

target of multiattackers are designed to deal with the problem of cooperative
encirclement or simultaneous attack in the case of known target acceleration
and unknown target acceleration. Multi-attacker communication network only
needs to contain a directed spanning tree, and does not require all attackers
to observe the target information, where at least one can observe the target.
The components along the attacker-target line of sight in the novel guidance
laws can reduce the relative remaining distance between the attacker and the
target at the same speed, thus completing simultaneous attack and avoiding the
calculation of the remaining time. The components of the guidance laws
perpendicular to the attacker-target line of sight can make the normal overload
of relative motion zero, so that the trajectory will not be distorted and the
collision problem within the attacker group can be avoided. The simulation
results verify the practicability of the novel guidance laws.

the tests of time-varying gravitational constant $G$, gravitational dipole

new constraints on these theories by combining Cassini experiment, lunar laser
ranging (LLR) measurements, and pulsar observations from PSRs J1738$+$0333 and
J0348$+$0432. We find that screening mechanism has important influence on
theoretical constraints. The strongest, second, and weakest constraints on BD
are from Cassini, pulsar, and LLR tests, respectively. The most stringent
constraint on SMG comes from LLR measurements and improves the previous best
constraint by more than seven orders of magnitude. We derive the bounds on the
cosmological evolution of the scalar background in these theories using the
time variation of $G$. The results of all tests agree well with general
relativity (GR) and give more stringent constraints on the deviations from GR.
Finally, as an example, we consider the chameleon model and derive the

welfare maximization in settings of incomplete information. Given oracle access
to an algorithm for an underlying optimization problem, the goal is to simulate
an incentive compatible mechanism. The mechanism will be evaluated on its
expected welfare, relative to the algorithm provided, and its complexity is
measured by the time (and queries) needed to simulate the mechanism on any
input. While it is known that black-box reductions are not possible in many
prior-free settings, settings with priors appear more promising: there are
known reductions for Bayesian incentive compatible (BIC) mechanism design for
general classes of welfare maximization problems. This dichotomy begs the
question: which mechanism design problems admit black-box reductions, and which
do not?
  Our main result is that black-box mechanism design is impossible under two of
the simplest settings not captured by known positive results. First, for the
problem of allocating $n$ goods to a single buyer whose valuation is additive
and independent across the goods, subject to a downward-closed constraint on
feasible allocations, we show that there is no polytime (in $n$) BIC black-box
reduction for expected welfare maximization. Second, for the setting of
multiple single-parameter agents---where polytime BIC reductions are known---we
show that no polytime reductions exist when the incentive requirement is
tightened to Max-In-Distributional-Range. In each case, we show that achieving
a sub-polynomial approximation to the expected welfare requires exponentially
many queries, even when the set of feasible allocations is known to be
downward-closed.

extra bits over an existing coded transmission link (referred to as coded
payload link) without any cost of extra transmission energy or extra bandwidth.
This is possible since a gap to the channel capacity typically exists for a
practical code. A new concept, termed as accessible capacity, is introduced to
specify the maximum rate at which the superposition transmission of extra bits
is reliable and has a negligible effect on the performance of the coded payload
link. For a binary-input output-symmetric (BIOS) memoryless channel, the
accessible capacity can be characterized as the difference between the channel
capacity and the mutual information rate of the coded payload link, which can
be numerically evaluated for very short payload codes. For a general payload
code, we present a simple lower bound on the accessible capacity, given by the
channel capacity minus the coding rate of the payload code. We then focus on
the scenarios where low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are implemented for
the payload link. We propose to transmit extra bits by random superposition for
encoding, and exhaustive search (with the aid of statistical learning) for
decoding. We further propose, by establishing an auxiliary channel (called
syndrome channel) induced from ""zero-forcing"" over the binary field, to
transmit extra bits with structured codes such as repetition codes and
first-order Reed-Muller (RM) codes. Numerical results show that up to 60 extra
bits can be reliably transmitted along with a rate-1/2 LDPC code of length
8064.

includes most mid-infrared excess members that were not previously imaged at
high spatial resolution, excluding close binaries and highly extincted objects,
thereby providing a more representative look at disk properties at 1--2 Myr.
Our 1.3 mm continuum maps reveal 12 disks with prominent dust gaps and rings, 2
of which are around primary stars in wide binaries, and 20 disks with no
resolved features at the observed resolution (hereafter smooth disks), 8 of
which are around the primary star in wide binaries. The smooth disks were
classified based on their lack of resolved substructures, but their most
prominent property is that they are all compact with small effective emission
radii ($R_{\rm eff,95\%} \lesssim 50$ au). In contrast, all disks with $R_{\rm
eff,95\%}$ of at least 55 au in our sample show detectable substructures.
Nevertheless, their inner emission cores (inside the resolved gaps) have
similar peak brightness, power law profiles, and transition radii to the
compact smooth disks, so the primary difference between these two categories is
the lack of outer substructures in the latter. These compact disks may lose
their outer disk through fast radial drift without dust trapping, or they might
be born with small sizes. The compact dust disks, as well as the inner disk
cores of extended ring disks, that look smooth at the current resolution will
likely show small-scale or low-contrast substructures at higher resolution. The
correlation between disk size and disk luminosity correlation demonstrates that
some of the compact disks are optically thick at millimeter wavelengths.

unpaired in the secondary structure of an RNA, which we call RNA state
inference, can be studied by different machine learning techniques. Successful
state inference of RNA sequences can be used to generate auxiliary information
for data-directed RNA secondary structure prediction. Bidirectional long
short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool that
can model global nonlinear sequence dependencies and have achieved
state-of-the-art performances on many different classification problems. This
paper presents a practical approach to RNA secondary structure inference
centered around a deep learning method for state inference. State predictions
from a deep bidirectional LSTM are used to generate synthetic SHAPE data that
can be incorporated into RNA secondary structure prediction via the Nearest
Neighbor Thermodynamic Model (NNTM). This method produces predicted secondary
structures for a diverse test set of 16S ribosomal RNA that are, on average, 25
percentage points more accurate than undirected MFE structures. These
improvements range from several percentage points for some sequences to nearly
50 percentage points for others. Accuracy is highly dependent on the success of
our state inference method, and investigating the global features of our state
predictions reveals that accuracy of both our state inference and structure
inference methods are highly dependent on the similarity of the sequence to the
dataset. This paper presents a deep learning state inference tool, trained and
tested on 16S ribosomal RNA. Converting these state predictions into synthetic
SHAPE data with which to direct NNTM can result in large improvements in
secondary structure prediction accuracy, as shown on a test set of 16S rRNA.

closed prime three-manifolds that don't at present already have them. One knows
these compound prime three-manifolds, have canonically up to deformation from
the identity, incompressible torus walls whose complementary components are
diffeomorphic to ""elemental"" prime three-manifolds carrying single Thurston
geometries. These geometric elementary parts have finite volume or linear
volume growth. This metric geometry is generalized here to Lie geometry meaning
an open cover by special coordinate charts in a model space whose transition
mappings are related by one of several finite dimensional Lie groups acting on
the model space. The Lie group is allowed to vary in a constrained manner from
region to region in the manifold. Our geometric version of torus wall crossing
after fixing finitely many parameters is rigid using covering spaces, pushouts,
and sliding flat toroidal cylinders rigidly together. A new concept, Lie
generated geometry, describes abstractly what these constructions produce.
These Lie generated geometries are determined by special coordinate chart
coverings as suggested above, but structurally they consist of sheaves of germs
of charts into the upper half space which are related by four Lie groups acting
there. The key point beside the Lie group generating system is that each germ
of the structure can be analytically continued along any path, like solving a
classical ODE in the complex plane. This defines for each Lie geometrized
manifold a developing map of its universal cover into upper half space. The
Theorem solves a 44 year old question from a 1976 Princeton math department
preprint motivated by the Poincar\'{e} Conjecture and finally documented in the

distributed deep learning because of its training-time efficiency, however,
extremely large-batch SGD leads to poor generalization and easily converges to
sharp minima, which prevents naive large-scale data-parallel SGD (DP-SGD) from
converging to good minima. To overcome this difficulty, we propose gradient
noise convolution (GNC), which effectively smooths sharper minima of the loss
function. For DP-SGD, GNC utilizes so-called gradient noise, which is induced
by stochastic gradient variation and convolved to the loss function as a
smoothing effect. GNC computation can be performed by simply computing the
stochastic gradient on each parallel worker and merging them, and is therefore
extremely easy to implement. Due to convolving with the gradient noise, which
tends to spread along a sharper direction of the loss function, GNC can
effectively smooth sharp minima and achieve better generalization, whereas
isotropic random noise cannot. We empirically show this effect by comparing GNC
with isotropic random noise, and show that it achieves state-of-the-art
generalization performance for large-scale deep neural network optimization.

trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) form satellite systems. Although the largest
Plutonian satellite, Charon, is thought to be an intact fragment of an impactor
directly formed via a giant impact, whether giant impacts can explain the
variations in secondary-to-primary mass ratios and spin/orbital periods among
all large TNOs remains to be determined. Here we systematically perform
hydrodynamic simulations to investigate satellite formation via giant impacts.
We find that the simulated secondary-to-primary mass ratio varies over a wide
range, which overlaps with observed mass ratios. We also reveal that the
satellite systems' current distribution of spin/orbital periods and small
eccentricity can be explained only when their spins and orbits tidally evolve:
initially as fluid-like bodies, but finally as rigid bodies. These results
suggest that all satellites of large TNOs were formed via giant impacts in the

acoustic models trained on the same data significantly outperforms a

ensemble of models is too computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose
to distill the knowledge of essence in an ensemble of models (i.e. the teacher

computation to deploy. Previously, all the soften outputs of the teacher model
are used to optimize the student model. We argue that not all the outputs of
the ensemble are necessary to be distilled. Some of the outputs may even
contain noisy information that is useless or even harmful to the training of
the student model. In addition, we propose to train the student model with a
multitask learning approach by utilizing both the soften outputs of the teacher
model and the correct hard labels. The proposed method achieves some surprising
results on the Switchboard data set. When the student model is trained together
with the correct labels and the essence knowledge from the teacher model, it
not only significantly outperforms another single model with the same
architecture that is trained only with the correct labels, but also
consistently outperforms the teacher model that is used to generate the soft

results are as follows. Small gas clouds with densities larger than $10^{10}$
atoms cm^{-3} corresponding to first stellar cores can be developed from gas
without turbulence. Consequently, new stars can be formed from the gas with
high star formation efficiencies (>0.5) in a bursty manner. However, star
formation can be suppressed when the gas mass fractions within GCs (f_g) are
less than a threshold value (f_g, th). This f_g, th is larger for GCs with
lower masses and larger gas disks. Star-gas interaction and gravitational
potentials of GCs can combine to suppress the formation of massive stars (i.e.,
""top-light"" stellar initial mass function). Formation of He-rich stars directly
from gas of massive AGB stars is possible in massive GCs due to low f_g, th
(<0.01). Short bursty star formation only for f_g>f_g, th can be partly
responsible for discrete multiple star formation events within GCs.

success across a wide variety of applications. To understand how these models
make predictions, people routinely turn to feature importance measures
calculated from tree ensembles. It has long been known that Mean Decrease
Impurity (MDI), one of the most widely used measures of feature importance,
incorrectly assigns high importance to noisy features, leading to systematic
bias in feature selection. In this paper, we address the feature selection bias
of MDI from both theoretical and methodological perspectives. Based on the
original definition of MDI by Breiman et al. for a single tree, we derive a
tight non-asymptotic bound on the expected bias of MDI importance of noisy
features, showing that deep trees have higher (expected) feature selection bias
than shallow ones. However, it is not clear how to reduce the bias of MDI using
its existing analytical expression. We derive a new analytical expression for
MDI, and based on this new expression, we are able to propose a debiased MDI
feature importance measure using out-of-bag samples, called MDI-oob. For both
the simulated data and a genomic ChIP dataset, MDI-oob achieves
state-of-the-art performance in feature selection from Random Forests for both

density functional theory calculations within the meta-generalized gradient

within the pressure range of 100 to 500~GPa. The SCAN phase diagram predicts
that the $C2/c-24$ and $P6_122-36$ structures are the best candidates for phase
III with an energy difference of less than 1~meV/atom. To verify the stability
of the competitive insulator structures of $C2/c-24$ and $P6_122-36$, we apply
the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method to optimise the percentage $\alpha$ of
exact-exchange in the trial many-body wave function. We found that the
optimised $\alpha$ equals to $40 \%$, and denote the corresponding exchange and
correlation functional as PBE1. The energy gain with respect to the well-known
hybrid functional PBE0, where $\alpha = 25\%$, varies with density and
structure. The PBE1-DMC enthalpy-pressure phase diagram predicts that the

recognize places. The basic task we consider is geo-localization - finding the
pose (position & orientation) of a camera in a large 3D scene from a single
image. We aim to experimentally explore the role of geometry in
geo-localization in a convolutional neural network (CNN) solution. We do so by
ignoring the often available texture of the scene. We therefore deliberately
avoid using texture or rich geometric details and use images projected from a
simple 3D model of a city, which we term lean images. Lean images contain
solely information that relates to the geometry of the area viewed (edges,
faces, or relative depth). We find that the network is capable of estimating
the camera pose from the lean images, and it does so not by memorization but by
some measure of geometric learning of the geographical area. The main
contributions of this paper are: (i) providing insight into the role of
geometry in the CNN learning process; and (ii) demonstrating the power of CNNs
for recovering camera pose using lean images.

individual-sequence approach to the guessing problem: in this setting, the goal
is to guess a secret, individual (deterministic) vector $x^n=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$,
by using a finite-state machine that sequentially generates randomized guesses
from a stream of purely random bits. We define the finite-state guessing
exponent as the asymptotic normalized logarithm of the minimum achievable
moment of the number of randomized guesses, generated by any finite-state
machine, until $x^n$ is guessed successfully. We show that the finite-state
guessing exponent of any sequence is intimately related to its finite-state
compressibility (due to Lempel and Ziv), and it is asymptotically achieved by
the decoder of (a certain modified version of) the 1978 Lempel-Ziv data
compression algorithm (a.k.a. the LZ78 algorithm), fed by purely random bits.
The results are also extended to the case where the guessing machine has access
to a side information sequence, $y^n=(y_1,\ldots,y_n)$, which is also an
individual sequence.

substructures with thin walls and narrow channels are avoided in our design
procedure, the proposed beam splitter can be used for waves with much shorter

then derived for arbitrary Gibbs states of systems that include long-range
interactions Secondly, we establish a quantitative relationship between the
concentration bound of the Gibbs state and the equivalence of canonical and
micro-canonical ensembles. We then evaluate the difference in the averages of
thermodynamic properties between the canonical and the micro-canonical
ensembles. Under the assumption of the Gaussian concentration bound on the
canonical ensemble, the difference between the ensemble descriptions is
upper-bounded by $\left[n^{-1} \log (n^{3/2}\Delta^{-1})\right]^{1/2}$ with $n$

to fluid motion are neglected. The generalization investigated in this paper is
motivated by the possibility that the diffusional regimes governing the

fractional) type. Under rather general assumptions, well-posedness and
regularity results are shown. In particular, by writing the equation governing

better representation for speaker separation, thus achieving better accuracy on
the target-speaker ASR. We evaluated our proposed method using
two-speaker-mixed speech in various signal-to-interference-ratio conditions. We
first built a strong target-speaker ASR baseline based on the state-of-the-art
lattice-free maximum mutual information. This baseline achieved a word error
rate (WER) of 18.06% on the test set while a normal ASR trained with clean data
produced a completely corrupted result (WER of 84.71%). Then, our proposed loss
further reduced the WER by 6.6% relative to this strong baseline, achieving a
WER of 16.87%. In addition to the accuracy improvement, we also showed that the

dark matter, central bulges and initial supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds at
their centers. The purpose of this work is to study the mass and dynamical
evolution of the initial SMBH seed during a Hubble cosmological time. It is a
complementation of our previous paper with different initial orbit conditions
and by introducing the SMBH seed in the initial galaxy. The disc of the
secondary galaxy has coplanar or polar orientation in relation to the disc of
the primary galaxy and their initial orbit are eccentric and prograde. The
primary and secondary galaxies have mass and size of Milky Way with an initial
SMBH seed. We have found that the merger of the primary and secondary discs can
result in a final normal disc or a final warped disc. After the fusion of
discs, the final one is thicker and larger than the initial disc. The tidal
effects are very important, modifying the evolution of the SMBH in the primary
and secondary galaxy differently. The mass of the SMBH of the primary galaxy
have increased by a factor ranging from 52 to 64 times the initial seed mass,
depending on the experiment. However, the mass of the SMBH of the secondary
galaxy have increased by a factor ranging from 6 to 33 times the initial SMBH
seed mass, depending also on the experiment. Most of the accreted particles
have come from the bulge and from the halo, depleting their particles. This
could explain why the observations show that the SMBH with masses of
approximately $10^6 M_\odot$ are found in many bulgeless galaxies. Only a small
number of the accreted particles has come from the disc. In some cases of final
merging stage of the two galaxies, the final SMBH of the secondary galaxy was
{ejected out of the galaxy}.

with organisms that move with swell and currents, like kelps. This paper

In this paper, we present a concept to automatically co-register aerial imagery
and untextured 3D model data. To refine a given initial camera pose, our
algorithm computes dense correspondence fields using SIFT flow between gradient
representations of the model and camera image, from which 2D-3D correspondences
are obtained. These correspondences are then used in an iterative optimization
scheme to refine the initial camera pose by minimizing the reprojection error.
Since it is assumed that the model does not contain texture information, our
algorithm is built up on an existing method based on Average Shading Gradients
(ASG) to generate gradient images based on raw geometry information only. We
apply our algorithm for the co-registering of aerial photographs to an
untextured, noisy mesh model. We have investigated different magnitudes of
input error and show that the proposed approach can reduce the final
reprojection error to a minimum of 1.27 plus-minus 0.54 pixels, which is less
than 10 % of its initial value. Furthermore, our evaluation shows that our
approach outperforms the accuracy of a standard Iterative Closest Point (ICP)

throughout the network layers, defined by the same metric on the fixed input

necessarily optimal. Ideally, local neighborhoods should be different at
different layers, as more latent information is extracted at deeper layers. We

can be adopted at each layer. We propose both linear (affine) and non-linear

achieves higher accuracy for all categories, with 8\% gain on earphones and

study the unitary quantum dynamics of reverse annealing for the mean-field-type

equilibrium statistical mechanics. In particular, we corroborate the
equilibrium analysis prediction that reverse annealing provides an exponential
speedup over conventional quantum annealing in terms of solving the $p$-spin

effective at revealing essential aspects of the dynamics of quantum annealing.
We also compare the results of quantum dynamics with the corresponding
classical dynamics, to reveal their similarities and differences. We
distinguish between two reverse annealing protocols we call adiabatic and
iterated reverse annealing. We further show that iterated reverse annealing, as

training of very deep neural networks. Residual blocks or units are made of a
set of stacked layers, where the inputs are added back to their outputs with
the aim of creating identity mappings. In practice, such identity mappings are
accomplished by means of the so-called skip or residual connections. However,
multiple implementation alternatives arise with respect to where such skip
connections are applied within the set of stacked layers that make up a
residual block. While ResNet architectures for image classification using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely discussed in the
literature, few works have adopted ResNet architectures so far for 1D audio
classification tasks. Thus, the suitability of different residual block designs
for raw audio classification is partly unknown. The purpose of this paper is to
analyze and discuss the performance of several residual block implementations
within a state-of-the-art CNN-based architecture for end-to-end audio
classification using raw audio waveforms. For comparison purposes, we analyze
as well the performance of the residual blocks under a similar 2D architecture

sign on their models and send them to the blockchain. In case customers or
manufacturers are malicious, we use the blockchain to replace the centralized
aggregator in the traditional FL system. Since records on the blockchain are
untampered, malicious customers or manufacturers' activities are traceable. In
the second stage, manufacturers select customers or organizations as miners for
calculating the averaged model using received models from customers. By the end
of the crowdsourcing task, one of the miners, who is selected as the temporary
leader, uploads the model to the blockchain. To protect customers' privacy and
improve the test accuracy, we enforce differential privacy on the extracted
features and propose a new normalization technique. We experimentally
demonstrate that our normalization technique outperforms batch normalization
when features are under differential privacy protection. In addition, to
attract more customers to participate in the crowdsourcing FL task, we design
an incentive mechanism to award participants.

the idea that the injecting energy will promote the formation of Cooper pairs,
a smart meta-superconductor B(P)SCCO consisting of B(P)SCCO microparticles and
Y2O3:Eu3++Ag or Y2O3:Eu3+ luminophor was designed. In the applied electric

electroluminescence (EL), thereby promoting the TC via EL energy injection. A
series of Y2O3:Eu3++Ag topological luminophor-doped B(P)SCCO samples was

the influence of EL on the T_C rather than the rare earth effect. Results
indicated that the TC of the Y2O3 or Y2O3:Sm3+ doping sample decreased.
However, the TC of the 0.2 wt% Y2O3:Eu3++Ag or Y2O3:Eu3+ luminophor-doped

interest continues to grow in the fields of AI safety and machine ethics. As a
contribution to these fields, this paper introduces an extension to Deep
Q-Networks (DQNs), called Empathic DQN, that is loosely inspired both by
empathy and the golden rule (""Do unto others as you would have them do unto
you""). Empathic DQN aims to help mitigate negative side effects to other agents
resulting from myopic goal-directed behavior. We assume a setting where a
learning agent coexists with other independent agents (who receive unknown
rewards), where some types of reward (e.g. negative rewards from physical harm)
may generalize across agents. Empathic DQN combines the typical (self-centered)
value with the estimated value of other agents, by imagining (by its own
standards) the value of it being in the other's situation (by considering
constructed states where both agents are swapped). Proof-of-concept results in
two gridworld environments highlight the approach's potential to decrease
collateral harms. While extending Empathic DQN to complex environments is
non-trivial, we believe that this first step highlights the potential of
bridge-work between machine ethics and RL to contribute useful priors for
norm-abiding RL agents.

beyond the classically possible. There are many ways quantum systems can be
entangled, ranging from the archetypal two-qubit case to more exotic scenarios
of entanglement in high dimensions or between many parties. Consequently, a
plethora of entanglement quantifiers and classifiers exist, corresponding to
different operational paradigms and mathematical techniques. However, for most
quantum systems, exactly quantifying the amount of entanglement is extremely
demanding, if at all possible. This is further exacerbated by the difficulty of
experimentally controlling and measuring complex quantum states. Consequently,
there are various approaches for experimentally detecting and certifying
entanglement when exact quantification is not an option, with a particular
focus on practically implementable methods and resource efficiency. The
applicability and performance of these methods strongly depends on the
assumptions one is willing to make regarding the involved quantum states and
measurements, in short, on the available prior information about the quantum
system. In this review we discuss the most commonly used paradigmatic
quantifiers of entanglement. For these, we survey state-of-the-art detection

less than that estimated from non-thermal line widths. McIntosh & De Pontieu
(2012) suggested that this discrepancy in energy might be due to the
line-of-sight (LOS) superposition of the several oscillating structures, which
can lead to an underestimation of the Alfv\'enic wave amplitudes and energies.
McIntosh & De Pontieu (2012) termed this coronal `dark' or `hidden' energy.
However, their simulations required the use of an additional, unknown source of
Alfv\'enic wave energy to provide agreement with measurements of the coronal
non-thermal line widths. In this study, we investigate the requirement of this
unknown source of additional `dark' energy in the solar corona using
gravitationally stratified 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of
propagating waves. We excite the transverse MHD waves and generate synthetic
observations for the Fe XIII emission line. We establish that the LOS
superposition greatly reduces the Doppler velocity amplitudes and increases the
non-thermal line widths. Importantly, our model generates the observed
wedge-shaped correlation between Doppler velocities and non-thermal line
widths. We find that the observed wave energy is only 0.2-1\% of the true wave
energy which explains 2-3 orders of magnitude of the energy discrepancy. We
conclusively establish that the true wave energies are hidden in the
non-thermal line widths. Hence, our results rule out the requirement for an

involves various considerations and tradeoffs such as prioritizing the risks to
mitigate and costs. The vast majority of studies for selecting a countermeasure
deployment are based on a limited risk assessment procedure that utilizes the
common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS). Such a risk assessment procedure
does not necessarily consider the prerequisites and exploitability of a
specific asset, cannot distinguish insider from outsider threat actor, and does
not express the consequences of exploiting a vulnerability as well as the
attacker's lateral movements. Other studies applied a more extensive risk
assessment procedure that relies on manual work and repeated assessment. These
solutions however, do not consider the network topology and do not specify the
optimal position for deploying the countermeasures, and therefore are less
practical. In this paper we suggest a heuristic search approach for selecting
the optimal countermeasure deployment under a given budget limitation. The
proposed method expresses the risk of the system using an extended attack graph
modeling, which considers the prerequisites and consequences of exploiting a
vulnerability, examines the attacker's potential lateral movements, and express
the physical network topology as well as vulnerabilities in network protocols.
In addition, unlike previous studies which utilizes attack graph for
countermeasure planning, the proposed methods does not require re-generating
the attack graph at each stage of the procedure, which is computationally
heavy, and therefore it provides a more accurate and practical countermeasure
deployment planning process.

decision-making problems in areas as diverse as industrial engineering,
computer communication, operations research, financial engineering,

to derive well-performing (Whittle's) index policies that are obtained by
solving a relaxed version of the original problem. However, the computation of
Whittle's index itself is a difficult problem and hence researchers focused on
calculating Whittle's index numerically or with a problem dependent approach.
  In our main contribution we derive an analytical expression for Whittle's
index for any Markovian bandit with both finite and infinite transition rates.
We derive sufficient conditions for the optimal solution of the relaxed problem
to be of threshold type, and obtain conditions for the bandit to be indexable,
a property assuring the existence of Whittle's index. Our solution approach
provides a unifying expression for Whittle's index, which we highlight by
retrieving known indices from literature as particular cases. The applicability
of finite rates is illustrated with the machine repairmen problem, and that of
infinite rates by an example of communication networks where transmission rates
react instantaneously to packet losses.

star-forming galaxies found to emit gamma rays from 0.1 to 50 GeV. Precise
measurements of the high-energy spectrum are crucial to study the particle
accelerators and probe the dominant emission mechanisms. We have carried out
125 hours of observations of NGC 1068 with the MAGIC telescopes in order to
search for gamma-ray emission in the very high energy band. We did not detect
significant gamma-ray emission, and set upper limits at 95\% confidence level
to the gamma-ray flux above 200 GeV f<5.1x10^{-13} cm^{-2} s ^{-1} . This limit
improves previous constraints by about an order of magnitude and allows us to
put tight constraints on the theoretical models for the gamma-ray emission. By
combining the MAGIC observations with the Fermi-LAT spectrum we limit the
parameter space (spectral slope, maximum energy) of the cosmic ray protons
predicted by hadronuclear models for the gamma-ray emission, while we find that
a model postulating leptonic emission from a semi-relativistic jet is fully
consistent with the limits. We provide predictions for IceCube detection of the
neutrino signal foreseen in the hadronic scenario. We predict a maximal IceCube
neutrino event rate of 0.07 yr^{-1}.

approximate solutions of high quality for certain NP-hard problems in nearly
constant time. Before solving a problem on D-Wave, several pre-processing
methods can be applied, one of them being the so-called spin reversal or gauge
transform. The spin reversal transform flips the sign of selected variables and
coefficients of the Ising or QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization)
representation of the problem that D-Wave minimizes. The spin reversal
transform leaves the ground state of the Ising model invariant, but can average
out the biases induced through analog and systematic errors on the device, thus
improving the quality of the solution that D-Wave returns. This work
investigates the effectiveness of the spin reversal transform for D-Wave 2000Q.
We consider two important NP-hard problems, the Maximum Clique and the Minimum
Vertex Cover problems, and show on a variety of input problem graphs that using
the spin reversal transform can yield substantial improvements in solution
quality. In contrast to the native spin reversal built into D-Wave, we consider
more general ways to reverse individual spins and we investigate the dependence
on the problem type, on the spin reversal probability, and possible advantages
of carrying out reversals on the qubit instead of the chain level. Most
importantly, for a given individual problem, we use our findings to optimize
the spin reversal transform using a genetic optimization algorithm.

the purpose to either detect, locate or assess damage for a wide range of
applications. Derived from its monitoring, one major current challenge on the
analysis of the acquired signal is the proper identification and separation of
each AE event. Current advanced methods for detecting events are primarily
focused on identifying with high accuracy the beginning of the AE wave;
however, the detection of the conclusion has been disregarded in the
literature. For an automatic continuous detection of events within a data
stream, this lack of accuracy for the conclusion of the events generates errors
in two critical aspects. In one hand, it deteriorates the accuracy of the
measurement of the events duration, truncating the span of the event
(undesirable in evaluation applications), and in the other hand, it causes
false detections. In this work, an accurate and computationally efficient AE
activity detector is presented, using a framework inspired by the area of
speech processing, and which provides the required indicators to accurately
detect the onset and the end of an AE event. This is achieved by means of a
threshold approach that instead of directly operates with the transduced
voltage signal it does so over the Short-Term Energy and the Short-Term
Zero-Crossing Rate measures of the signal. The STE-ZCR method is developed for
an application related to the continuous monitoring of a single AE channel
derived from the characterization of metallic components by means of a uniaxial
tensile test. Additionally, two experimental test-benches are implemented with
the aim to quantify the accuracy and the quality of event detection of the
presented method. Finally, the obtained results are compared with four
different techniques, representing the current state of the art related to AE
activity detection.

challenge for modeling and analyzing graph data. Recently, Graph Neural Network
(GNNs) are proposed as a general and powerful framework to handle tasks on
graph data, e.g., node embedding, link prediction and node classification. As a
representative implementation of GNNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are
successfully applied in a variety of tasks on real datasets. However, GAT is
designed to networks with only positive links and fails to handle signed
networks which contain both positive and negative links. In this paper, we
propose Signed Graph Attention Networks (SiGATs), generalizing GAT to signed
networks. SiGAT incorporates graph motifs into GAT to capture two well-known
theories in signed network research, i.e., balance theory and status theory. In
SiGAT, motifs offer us the flexible structural pattern to aggregate and
propagate messages on the signed network to generate node embeddings. We
evaluate the proposed SiGAT method by applying it to the signed link prediction
task. Experimental results on three real datasets demonstrate that SiGAT
outperforms feature-based method, network embedding method and state-of-the-art

type of graph partitioning in order to efficiently parallelize these

structure of a thresholded density matrix, and partition that graph into
several components. Each separate submatrix (corresponding to each subgraph) is
then substituted into the matrix polynomial, and the result for the full matrix
polynomial is reassembled at the end from the individual polynomials. This
paper starts by introducing a rigorous definition as well as a mathematical
justification of this partitioning problem. We assess the performance of
several methods to compute graph partitions with respect to both the quality of
the partitioning and their runtime.

computers. Traditional approaches decrease the processor frequency in idle or
synchronisation periods. However, in High-Performance Computing (HPC) this is
not sufficient: if the executed code is load balanced, there are neither idle
nor synchronisation phases that can be exploited. Therefore, alternative
self-tuning approaches are needed, which allow exploiting different compute
characteristics of HPC programs.
  The novel notion of application regions based on function call stacks,
introduced in the Horizon 2020 Project READEX, allows us to define such a
self-tuning approach. In this paper, we combine these regions with the
Q-Learning typical state-action maps, which save information about available
states, possible actions to take, and the expected rewards. By exploiting the
existing processor power interface, we are able to provide direct feedback to
the learning process. This approach allows us to save up to 15% energy, while
only adding a minor runtime overhead.

  Learning for Autonomous Vehicles",,,,,"cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Autonomous vehicles are controlled today either based on sequences of
decoupled perception-planning-action operations, either based on End2End or
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems. Current deep learning solutions for
autonomous driving are subject to several limitations (e.g. they estimate
driving actions through a direct mapping of sensors to actuators, or require
complex reward shaping methods). Although the cost function used for training
can aggregate multiple weighted objectives, the gradient descent step is
computed by the backpropagation algorithm using a single-objective loss. To
address these issues, we introduce NeuroTrajectory, which is a multi-objective
neuroevolutionary approach to local state trajectory learning for autonomous
driving, where the desired state trajectory of the ego-vehicle is estimated
over a finite prediction horizon by a perception-planning deep neural network.
In comparison to DRL methods, which predict optimal actions for the upcoming
sampling time, we estimate a sequence of optimal states that can be used for
motion control. We propose an approach which uses genetic algorithms for
training a population of deep neural networks, where each network individual is
evaluated based on a multi-objective fitness vector, with the purpose of
establishing a so-called Pareto front of optimal deep neural networks. The
performance of an individual is given by a fitness vector composed of three
elements. Each element describes the vehicle's travel path, lateral velocity
and longitudinal speed, respectively. The same network structure can be trained
on synthetic, as well as on real-world data sequences. We have benchmarked our
system against a baseline Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), as well as against an
End2End supervised learning method.

octahedra and cation network in which one third of the octahedra are vacant,
one third host magnesium and one third titanium. By giving up these

Our experiments and electronic-energy-band-structure computations show that the
magnetic and electric properties of Mg-Ti-O films can drastically be changed
and controlled by Mg- and Ti-cation arrangement and abundancy in the octahedra.
Insulating titanium- and semiconducting magnesium-rich films were ferromagnetic
up to elevated temperatures. The presence and origin of ferromagnetic
insulating phase in the films is not apparent - the expectation, based on the
well-established rules set by Goodenough and Kanamori, is paramagnetic or
antiferromagnetic ordering. We show that ferro- and paramagnetic phases,
possessing the same stoichiometry, can be obtained by merely rearranging the
cations, thus allowing defect-free interfaces in multilayer structures.

to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of our observations and average out line

velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$,
which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales (1
pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual
filaments are about 0.05 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, which result in a total accretion
rate of 0.16 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Some filaments harbor dense cores that are
likely forming stars and stellar clusters. The stellar content of these dense
cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. We conclude that the cores may
merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing
a significant amount of gas, resulting in a ""damp"" merger. The high density and
mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments
with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming

is a promising technology for the manipulation of thermal loads in solid state

the electron-phonon coupling, as it represents a thermal leakage channel to the
phonon bath. Graphene is a two-dimensional material that exhibits a weaker
electron-phonon coupling compared to standard metals. For this reason, we study
the electron cooling in graphene-based systems consisting of a graphene sheet
contacted by two insulator/superconductor junctions. We show that, by properly
biasing the graphene, its electronic temperature can reach base values lower
than those achieved in similar systems based on metallic ultra-thin films.
Moreover, the lower electron-phonon coupling is mirrored in a lower heat power
pumped into the superconducting leads, thus avoiding their overheating and
preserving the cooling mechanisms. Finally, we analyze the possible application
of cooled graphene as a bolometric radiation sensor. We study its main figures
of merit, i.e. responsivity, noise equivalent power and response time. In
particular, we show that the built-in electron refrigeration allows reaching a
responsivity of the order of 50 nA/pW and a noise equivalent power of order of
$\rm 10^{-18}\, W\, Hz^{-1/2}$ while the response speed is about 10 ns,

specific requirements. These networks can be deployed by traditional mobile
network operators or entrant local operators. With a large number of verticals
with different service requirements, while considering the network deployment
cost in a single local area, it will not be economically feasible to deploy
separate networks for each vertical. Thus, locally deployed 5G networks (aka
micro operator networks) that can serve multiple verticals with multiple
tenants in a location have gained increasing attention. Network slicing will
enable a 5G micro-operator network to efficiently serve the multiple verticals
and their tenants with different network requirements. This paper addresses how
network slicing management functions can be used to implement, orchestrate and
manage network slicing in different deployments of a local 5G micro-operator
including the serving of closed, open and mixed customer groups. The paper
proposes a descriptive technique by which different network slicing management
functionalities defined by 3GPP can be used in coordination to create,
orchestrate and manage network slicing for different deployment scenarios of a
micro-operator. This is based on the network slice instance configuration type
that can exist for each scenario. A network slice formation sequence is
developed for the closed micro operator network to illustrate the tasks of the
management functions. The results indicate that network slicing management
plays a key role in designing local 5G networks that can serve different
customer groups in the verticals.

closed-shell stability that inhibit conventional nanoparticle (NP) growth
processes. Though MSCs have been of increasing interest, understanding the
reaction pathways toward their nucleation and stabilization is an outstanding
issue. In this work, we demonstrate that high concentration synthesis (1000 mM)
promotes a well-defined reaction pathway to form high-purity MSCs (greater than
99.9 percent). The MSCs are resistant to typical growth and dissolution
processes. Based on insights from in-situ X-ray scattering analysis, we
attribute this stability to the accompanying production of a large, hexagonal
organic-inorganic mesophase (greater than 100 nm grain size) that arrests
growth of the MSCs and prevents NP growth. At intermediate concentrations (500
mM), the MSC mesophase forms, but is unstable, resulting in NP growth at the
expense of the assemblies. These results provide an alternate explanation for
the high stability of MSCs. Whereas the conventional mantra has been that the
stability of MSCs derives from the precise arrangement of the inorganic
structures (i.e., closed-shell atomic packing), we demonstrate that anisotropic
clusters can also be stabilized by self-forming fibrous mesophase assemblies.
At lower concentration (less than 200 mM or greater than 16 acid-to-metal),
MSCs are further destabilized and NPs formation dominates that of MSCs.
Overall, the high concentration approach intensifies and showcases inherent
concentration-dependent surfactant phase behavior that is not accessible in
conventional (i.e., dilute) conditions. This work provides not only a robust
method to synthesize, stabilize, and study identical MSC products, but also
uncovers an underappreciated stabilizing interaction between surfactants and
clusters.

operations is local binary patterns. The proposed approach includes two steps.
First, a noise resistant version of color local binary patterns is proposed to
decrease sensitivity to noise of LBP. This step is evaluated based on
combination of color sensor information using AND operation. In second step, a
significant points selection algorithm is proposed to select significant LBP.
This phase decreases final computational complexity along with increasing
accuracy rate. The Proposed approach is evaluated using Vistex, Outex, and KTH
TIPS2a data sets. Our approach has been compared with some state of the art
methods. It is experimentally demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves
highest accuracy. In two other experiments, result show low noise sensitivity

previous versions of LBP. Rotation invariant, multi resolution, general
usability are other advantages of our proposed approach. In the present paper,
a new version of LBP is proposed originally, which is called Hybrid color local

extract color and texture features jointly. Also, a significant point selection

of Gliobastoma Multiform (GBM) and currently being investigated for additional
tumor types. TTFields are delivered to the tumor through the placement of
transducer arrays (TAs) placed on the patient scalp. The positions of the TAs
are associated with treatment outcomes via simulations of the electric fields.
Therefore, we are currently developing a method for recommending optimal
placement of TAs. A key step to achieve this goal is to correctly segment the
head into tissues of similar electrical properties. Visual inspection of
segmentation quality is invaluable but time-consuming. Automatic quality
assessment can assist in automatic refinement of the segmentation parameters,
suggest flaw points to the user and indicate if the segmented method is of
sufficient accuracy for TTFields simulation. As a first step in this direction,
we identified a set of features that are relevant to atlas-based segmentation
and show that these are significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with a similarity
measure between validated and automatically computed segmentations.
Furthermore, we incorporated these features in a decision tree regressor to
predict the similarity of the validated and computed segmentations of 20
TTFields patients using a leave-one-out approach. The predicted similarity
measures were highly correlated with the actual ones (average abs. difference
3% (SD = 3%); r = 0.92, p < 0.001). We conclude that quality estimation of
segmentations is feasible by incorporating machine learning and
segmentation-relevant features.

location-based service provision or DNA sequence analysis. This dissemination,

this paper, we consider the problem of sanitizing a string by concealing the
occurrences of sensitive patterns, while maintaining data utility, in two
settings that are relevant to many common string processing tasks.
  In the first setting, we aim to generate the minimal-length string that
preserves the order of appearance and frequency of all non-sensitive patterns.
Such a string allows accurately performing tasks based on the sequential nature
and pattern frequencies of the string. To construct such a string, we propose a
time-optimal algorithm, TFS-ALGO. We also propose another time-optimal
algorithm, PFS-ALGO, which preserves a partial order of appearance of
non-sensitive patterns but produces a much shorter string that can be analyzed
more efficiently. The strings produced by either of these algorithms are
constructed by concatenating non-sensitive parts of the input string. However,
it is possible to detect the sensitive patterns by ``reversing'' the
concatenation operations. In response, we propose a heuristic, MCSR-ALGO, which
replaces letters in the strings output by the algorithms with carefully
selected letters, so that sensitive patterns are not reinstated, implausible
patterns are not introduced, and occurrences of spurious patterns are
prevented. In the second setting, we aim to generate a string that is at
minimal edit distance from the original string, in addition to preserving the
order of appearance and frequency of all non-sensitive patterns. To construct
such a string, we propose an algorithm, ETFS-ALGO, based on solving specific

between two binary regions. However, modern segmentation algorithms output a
probability or confidence map with continuous values in the zero-to-one
interval. Moreover, these binary overlapping measures are biased to structure
size. Addressing these challenges is the objective of this work. Methods: We
extend the definition of the classical Dice coefficient (DC) overlap to
facilitate the direct comparison of a ground truth binary image with a
probabilistic map. We call the extended method continuous Dice coefficient
(cDC) and show that 1) cDC is less or equal to 1 and cDC = 1 if-and-only-if the
structures overlap is complete, and, 2) cDC is monotonically decreasing with
the amount of overlap. We compare the classical DC and the cDC in a simulation
of partial volume effects that incorporates segmentations of common targets for
deep-brainstimulation. Lastly, we investigate the cDC for an automatic
segmentation of the subthalamic-nucleus. Results: Partial volume effect
simulation on thalamus (large structure) resulted with DC and cDC averages (SD)
of 0.98 (0.006) and 0.99 (0.001), respectively. For subthalamic-nucleus (small
structure) DC and cDC were 0.86 (0.025) and 0.97 (0.006), respectively. The DC
and cDC for automatic STN segmentation were 0.66 and 0.80, respectively.
Conclusion: The cDC is well defined for probabilistic segmentation, less biased
to structure size and more robust to partial volume effects in comparison to
DC. Significance: The proposed method facilitates a better evaluation of

fundamentally different as the owners have complete control to do arbitrary

explore a hybrid approach where a managed cryptocurrency is maintained through
distributed consensus based methods. The currency administrator can perform
ongoing management functions while the consensus methods enforce the rules of
the cryptocurrency and provide transparency for all management actions. This
enables the introduction of money management features common in fiat currencies
but where the managing entity cannot perform arbitrary actions and transparency
is enforced. We thus eliminate the need for users to trust the currency
administrator but also to enable the administrator to manage the

intertemporal choices: trade-offs in time between closer options with potential
short-term benefit and future options with potential long-term benefit.
However, how software professionals make intertemporal decisions is not well
understood.
  Aim: This paper investigates how shifting time frames influence preferences
in software projects in relation to purposefully selected background factors.
  Method: We investigate temporal discounting by replicating a
questionnaire-based observational study. The replication uses a
changed-population and -experimenter design to increase the internal and
external validity of the original results.
  Results: The results of this study confirm the occurrence of temporal
discounting in samples of both professional and student participants from
different countries and demonstrate strong variance in discounting between
study participants. We found that professional experience influenced
discounting. Participants with broader professional experience exhibited less
discounting than those with narrower experience.
  Conclusions: The results provide strong empirical support for the relevance
and importance of temporal discounting in SE and the urgency of targeted
interdisciplinary research to explore the underlying mechanisms and their
theoretical and practical implications. The results suggest that technical debt
management could be improved by increasing the breadth of experience available
for critical decisions with long-term impact. In addition, the present study
provides a methodological basis for replicating temporal discounting studies in

quadratic or cubic nonlinearities in such systems can lead to growth of small,

establish global existence and diffusive Gaussian-like decay for exponentially

pointwise estimates. The situation becomes very delicate if other quadratic or

mix-term and a Burgers'-type coupling can compensate for a cubic term due to

Especially on the consumer market, manufacturers focus on new features and
early releases at the expense of a comprehensive security strategy. Hence,
experts have started calling for regulation of the IoT consumer market, while
policymakers are seeking for suitable regulatory approaches. We investigate how
manufacturers can be incentivized to increase sustainable security efforts for
IoT products. We propose mandatory security update labels that inform consumers
during buying decisions about the willingness of the manufacturer to provide
security updates in the future. Mandatory means that the labels explicitly
state when security updates are not guaranteed. We conducted a user study with
more than 1,400 participants to assess the importance of security update labels
for the consumer choice by means of a conjoint analysis. The results show that
the availability of security updates (until which date the updates are
guaranteed) accounts for 8% to 35% impact on overall consumers' choice,
depending on the perceived security risk of the product category. For products
with a high perceived security risk, this availability is twice as important as
other high-ranked product attributes. Moreover, provisioning time for security
updates (how quickly the product will be patched after a vulnerability is
discovered) additionally accounts for 7% to 25% impact on consumers' choices.
The proposed labels are intuitively understood by consumers, do not require
product assessments by third parties before release, and have a potential to
incentivize manufacturers to provide sustainable security support.

active. In the passive learning case, we show that limit-average automata are
not PAC-learnable as samples must be of exponential-size to provide (with good
probability) enough details to learn an automaton. We also show that the
problem of finding an automaton that fits a given sample is NP-complete. In the
active learning case, we show that limit-average automata can be learned
almost-exactly, i.e., we can learn in polynomial time an automaton that is
consistent with the target automaton on almost all words. On the other hand, we
show that the problem of learning an automaton that approximates the target
automaton (with perhaps fewer states) is NP-complete. The abovementioned
results are shown for the uniform distribution on words. We briefly discuss
learning over different distributions.

pure self-energy logarithmic contributions of order $\alpha^2(Z\alpha)^8m$ and
$\alpha^2(Z\alpha)^9m$ and estimated the subleading terms of order
$\alpha^2(Z\alpha)^7m$, $\alpha^2(Z\alpha)^8m$, and $\alpha^2(Z\alpha)^9m$. The
determination of those higher-order contributions enabled us to improve the
overall accuracy of the evaluation of the two-loop self-energy of the electron.
We investigated the asymptotic behavior of the integrand related to the
next-to-leading three-loop term (order $\alpha^3(Z\alpha)^5m$, coefficient
$C_{50}$ in standard notation) and applied it to approximate integration over
the loop momentum. Our result for contributions to the $1s$ Lamb shift for the

$(-3.3\pm10.5)(\alpha^3/\pi^3)(Z\alpha)^5m$. Altogether, we have completed the
evaluation of the logarithmic contributions to the $1s$ Lamb shift of order
$\alpha^8m$ and reduced the overall $\alpha^8m$ uncertainty by approximately a
factor of three for H, D, and He$^+$ as compared with the most recent CODATA

modelled as either an extensive-form game (EFG) in game theory or a partially

One issue with the current situation is that while most practical problems can
be modelled in both formalisms, the relationship of the two models is unclear,
which hinders the transfer of ideas between the two communities. A second issue
is that while EFGs have recently seen significant algorithmic progress, their
classical formalization is unsuitable for efficient presentation of the
underlying ideas, such as those around decomposition.
  To solve the first issue, we introduce factored-observation stochastic games
(FOSGs), a minor modification of the POSG formalism which distinguishes between
private and public observation and thereby greatly simplifies decomposition. To
remedy the second issue, we show that FOSGs and POSGs are naturally connected
to EFGs: by ""unrolling"" a FOSG into its tree form, we obtain an EFG.
Conversely, any perfect-recall timeable EFG corresponds to some underlying FOSG
in this manner. Moreover, this relationship justifies several minor
modifications to the classical EFG formalization that recently appeared as an
implicit response to the model's issues with decomposition. Finally, we
illustrate the transfer of ideas between EFGs and MARL by presenting three key
EFG techniques -- counterfactual regret minimization, sequence form, and
decomposition -- in the FOSG framework.

multi-dimensional integrals is explored. More specifically, a method based on
an adaptive scheme for error variance selection in Monte Carlo integration

framework to guide the optimization search. The MCI is employed to approximate
the integrals, because it provides the variance of the error in the
integration. In the proposed approach, the variance of the integration error is
included into a Stochastic Kriging framework by setting a target variance in
the MCI. We show that the variance of the error of the MCI may be controlled by
the designer and that its value strongly influences the computational cost and
the exploration ability of the optimization process. Hence, we propose an
adaptive scheme for automatic selection of the target variance during the sEGO
search. The robustness and efficiency of the proposed adaptive approach were
evaluated on global optimization stochastic benchmark functions as well as on a
tuned mass damper design problem. The results showed that the proposed adaptive
approach consistently outperformed the constant approach and a multi-start
optimization method. Moreover, the use of MCI enabled the method application in
problems with high number of stochastic dimensions. On the other hand, the main
limitation of the method is inherited from sEGO coupled with the Kriging
metamodel: the efficiency of the approach is reduced when the number of design
variables increases.

different sensing and acting capabilities of robots, their conceptual
understanding of objects must be generated from a robot's perspective entirely,
which asks for robot-centric conceptual knowledge about objects. With this goal
in mind, this article motivates that such knowledge should be based on physical

multi-modal property extraction forms the basis on which our second

unsupervised clustering methods to transform numerical property data into

generate conceptual knowledge about objects using the robot-centric symbols. A
preliminary implementation of the proposed framework is employed to acquire a
dataset comprising physical and functional property data of 110 houshold

boiling (DNB) crisis is essential to the design and safety of a two-phase flow
boiling system. Despite the abundance of predictive tools available to the
thermal engineering community, the path for an accurate, robust CHF model
remains elusive due to lack of consensus on the DNB triggering mechanism. This
work aims to apply a physics-informed, machine learning (ML)-aided hybrid
framework to achieve superior predictive capabilities. Such a hybrid approach
takes advantage of existing understanding in the field of interest (i.e.,
domain knowledge) and uses ML to capture undiscovered information from the
mismatch between the actual and domain knowledge-predicted target. A detailed
case study is carried out with an extensive DNB-specific CHF database to
demonstrate (1) the improved performance of the hybrid approach as compared to
traditional domain knowledge-based models, and (2) the hybrid model's superior
generalization capabilities over standalone ML methods across a wide range of
flow conditions. The hybrid framework could also readily extend its
applicability domain and complexity on the fly, showing an elevated level of
flexibility and robustness. Based on the case study conclusions, the
window-type extrapolation mapping methodology is further proposed to better
inform high-cost experimental work.

a negative answer to the question for $M = \mathbb{N}_0$: he constructed an
atomic integral domain $R$ such that the polynomial ring $R[x]$ is not atomic.
However, the question of whether a monoid algebra $F[x;M]$ over a field $F$ is
atomic provided that $M$ is atomic has been open since then. Here we offer a
negative answer to this question. First, we find for any infinite cardinal
$\kappa$ a torsion-free atomic monoid $M$ of rank $\kappa$ satisfying that the
monoid domain $R[x;M]$ is not atomic for any integral domain $R$. Then for
every $n \ge 2$ and for each field $F$ of finite characteristic we exhibit a
torsion-free atomic monoid of rank $n$ such that $F[x;M]$ is not atomic.
Finally, we construct a torsion-free atomic monoid $M$ of rank $1$ such that
$\mathbb{Z}_2[x;M]$ is not atomic.

multi-scale generalization of the celebrated Gibbs posterior distribution,
proving that the derived distribution achieves the unique minimum. This leads
to a new training procedure for neural nets with performance guarantees, which
exploits the chain rule of relative entropy rather than the chain rule of

band, and also unveiling populations that do not merge, thus providing a tracer
of the compact-object binary population in an enigmatic portion of its life. We
argue that periodically repeating lensing flares could be observed for ~100
ksec orbital-period binaries with the future Lynx X-ray mission, possibly
concurrent with gravitational wave emission in the LISA band. Binaries with
longer orbital periods could be more common and be detectable as single lensing
flares, though with reliance on a model for the flare that can be tested by
observations of succeeding flares. Non-detection of such events, even with
existing X-ray observations, will help to constrain the population of EM bright
compact-object binaries.

singular operators, which were extensively studied and generalized. They have a
natural multi-parameter counterpart. Decomposition of those operators into
paraproducts, and, more generally to multi-parameter paraproducts is a staple
of the theory. In this paper we consider weighted estimates for bi-parameter
paraproducts that appear from such multipliers. Then we apply our harmonic
analysis results to several complex variables. Namely, we show that a
(weighted) Carleson embedding for a scale of Dirichlet spaces from the bi-torus
to the bi-disc is equivalent to a simple ``box'' condition, for product weights
on the bi-disc and arbitrary weights on the bi-torus. This gives a new simple
necessary and sufficient condition for the embedding of the whole scale of
weighted Dirichlet spaces of holomorphic functions on the bi-disc. This scale
of Dirichlet spaces includes the classical Dirichlet space on the bi-disc. Our
result is in contrast to the classical situation on the bi-disc considered by
Chang and Fefferman, when a counterexample due to Carleson shows that the
``box'' condition does not suffice for the embedding to hold. But this was the
embedding of bi-harmonic functions in bi-harmonic Hardy class. Our result can
be viewed as a new and unexpected combinatorial property of all positive finite
planar measures.

material, like a transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer, residing on a
piezoelectric substrate. The essence of this effect lies in the emergence of a
drag electric current (and a spin current) due to a propagating surface
acoustic wave. This current consists of three contributions, one independent of
the valley index and proportional to the acoustic wave vector, the other
arising due to the trigonal warping of the electron dispersion, and the third
one is due to the Berry phase, which Bloch electrons acquire traveling along
the crystal. As a result, there appear components of the current orthogonal to
the acoustic wave vector. Further, we build an angular pattern, encompassing
nontrivial topological properties of the acoustoelectric current, and suggest a
way to run and measure the conventional diffusive, warping, and acoustoelectric
valley Hall currents independently. We develop a theory, which opens a way to
manipulate valley transport by acoustic methods, expanding the applicability of
valleytronic effects on acoustoelectronic devices.

few observations. First, we demonstrate that surrogate models with appropriate
noise distributions can absorb challenging structures in the objective function
by treating them as irreducible uncertainty. Secondly, we show that a latent

that, during electromechanical transients triggered by large contingencies,

implicitly factorizing a matrix with a closed form, and 2)the explicit
factorization of such matrix generates more powerful embeddings than existing

dense---is prohibitively expensive in terms of both time and space, making it
not scalable for large networks.
  In this work, we present the algorithm of large-scale network embedding as
sparse matrix factorization (NetSMF). NetSMF leverages theories from spectral
sparsification to efficiently sparsify the aforementioned dense matrix,
enabling significantly improved efficiency in embedding learning. The
sparsified matrix is spectrally close to the original dense one with a
theoretically bounded approximation error, which helps maintain the
representation power of the learned embeddings. We conduct experiments on
networks of various scales and types. Results show that among both popular
benchmarks and factorization based methods, NetSMF is the only method that
achieves both high efficiency and effectiveness. We show that NetSMF requires
only 24 hours to generate effective embeddings for a large-scale academic
collaboration network with tens of millions of nodes, while it would cost
DeepWalk months and is computationally infeasible for the dense matrix

equally spaced in time. However, this assumption does not hold in many diverse

There are some techniques that fit unequally spaced time series, such as the
continuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) processes. These models
are defined as the solution of a stochastic differential equation. It is not
uncommon in astronomical time series, that the time gaps between observations
are large. Therefore, an alternative suitable approach to modeling astronomical
time series with large gaps between observations should be based on the
solution of a difference equation of a discrete process. In this work we
propose a novel model to fit irregular time series called the complex irregular
autoregressive (CIAR) model that is represented directly as a discrete-time
process. We show that the model is weakly stationary and that it can be
represented as a state-space system, allowing efficient maximum likelihood
estimation based on the Kalman recursions. Furthermore, we show via Monte Carlo
simulations that the finite sample performance of the parameter estimation is
accurate. The proposed methodology is applied to light curves from periodic
variable stars, illustrating how the model can be implemented to detect poor
adjustment of the harmonic model. This can occur when the period has not been
accurately estimated or when the variable stars are multiperiodic. Last, we
show how the CIAR model, through its state space representation, allows
unobserved measurements to be forecast.

the oxygen carrier. To stabilize these nanoparticles at high temperatures, they
are embedded in an ordered, gas-permeable mesoporous silica matrix. We
experimentally obtained near 100% CO selectivity in a cyclic redox system at
750{\deg}C to 935{\deg}C, which is a significantly lower temperature range than

elucidate the origins for such selectivity and reveal that CH4 adsorption

exotic compact objects with near-horizon structure. Recently there have been
observational claims that echoes are indeed present in stretches of data from
Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo immediately following gravitational wave
signals from presumed binary black hole mergers, as well as a binary neutron
star merger. In this paper we deploy a morphology-independent search algorithm
for echoes introduced in Tsang et al., Phys. Rev. D 98, 024023 (2018), which
(a) is able to accurately reconstruct a possible echoes signal with minimal
assumptions about their morphology, and (b) computes Bayesian evidences for the
hypotheses that the data contain a signal, an instrumental glitch, or just
stationary, Gaussian noise. Here we apply this analysis method to all the
significant events in the first Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-1),
which comprises the signals from binary black hole and binary neutron star
coalescences found during the first and second observing runs of Advanced LIGO
and Advanced Virgo. In all cases, the ratios of evidences for signal versus
noise and signal versus glitch do not rise above their respective ""background
distributions"" obtained from detector noise, the smallest $p$-value being 3%
(for event GW170823). Hence we find no statistically significant evidence for
echoes in GWTC-1.

bounded sn-, cn- and dn-function solutions, as well as the hyperbolic soliton

also derive the complex-amplitude stationary solutions, in which all the
bounded cases obey either the \PT- or anti-\PT-symmetric relation. In
particular, the complex tanh-function solution can exhibit no spatial
localization in addition to the dark and anti-dark soliton profiles, which is
sharp contrast with the common dark soliton. Considering the physical relevance

larger, have never observed an event with even remotely comparable energy.
Thus, if the energy of the Fly's Eye event was indeed well measured, as
strongly suggested by the data, then it remains a great mystery or an
unbelievable stroke of luck. At such high energies, the Universe is very opaque
to electromagnetic interacting particles, whether photons, protons or heavy

  Collaborative Filtering","TOIS Minor",,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As the core of recommender system, collaborative filtering (CF) models the
affinity between a user and an item from historical user-item interactions,
such as clicks, purchases, and so on. Benefited from the strong representation
power, neural networks have recently revolutionized the recommendation
research, setting up a new standard for CF. However, existing neural
recommender models do not explicitly consider the correlations among embedding
dimensions, making them less effective in modeling the interaction function
between users and items. In this work, we emphasize on modeling the
correlations among embedding dimensions in neural networks to pursue higher
effectiveness for CF. We propose a novel and general neural collaborative
filtering framework, namely ConvNCF, which is featured with two designs: 1)
applying outer product on user embedding and item embedding to explicitly model
the pairwise correlations between embedding dimensions, and 2) employing
convolutional neural network above the outer product to learn the high-order
correlations among embedding dimensions. To justify our proposal, we present
three instantiations of ConvNCF by using different inputs to represent a user
and conduct experiments on two real-world datasets. Extensive results verify
the utility of modeling embedding dimension correlations with ConvNCF, which
outperforms several competitive CF methods.

Although data augmentation has been shown to significantly improve image
classification, its potential has not been thoroughly investigated for object

detection, data augmentation may be of even greater importance for this
computer vision task. In this work, we study the impact of data augmentation on
object detection. We first demonstrate that data augmentation operations
borrowed from image classification may be helpful for training detection
models, but the improvement is limited. Thus, we investigate how learned,
specialized data augmentation policies improve generalization performance for
detection models. Importantly, these augmentation policies only affect training
and leave a trained model unchanged during evaluation. Experiments on the COCO
dataset indicate that an optimized data augmentation policy improves detection
accuracy by more than +2.3 mAP, and allow a single inference model to achieve a
state-of-the-art accuracy of 50.7 mAP. Importantly, the best policy found on
COCO may be transferred unchanged to other detection datasets and models to
improve predictive accuracy. For example, the best augmentation policy
identified with COCO improves a strong baseline on PASCAL-VOC by +2.7 mAP. Our
results also reveal that a learned augmentation policy is superior to
state-of-the-art architecture regularization methods for object detection, even

is effective but struggles due to size of data and manual labour. This paper
explores to what extent predictive models can be used to predict network

whether the predictive performance is enhanced when analyzing DNS-queries and
responses together and which feature set that can be used for DNS-tunneled
network prediction. The tested protocols are SSH, SFTP and Telnet and the

To train the models we extract the IP Packet length, Name length and Name

experimental research strategy it is empirically shown that the performance of
the models increases when training the models on the query and respose pairs

$L\geq\Omega\left((S_1+S_2)\log^{2}(K+N)\right)$. Numerical experiments show
that the scaling constant in the theorem is not too large. We also introduce
variants of $\ell_1$-BranchHull for the purposes of tolerating noise and
outliers, and for the purpose of recovering piecewise constant signals. We

Previous work on the subject has derived the apparent form of an object, often
making mention of George Gamow's relativistic cyclist thought experiment. Here,
a rigorous re-analysis of the cyclist, this time in 3-dimensions, is undertaken
for a binocular observer, accounting for both the distortion in apparent
position and the relativistic colour and intensity shifts undergone by a fast
moving object. A methodology for analysing binocular relativistic data is then
introduced, allowing the fitting of experimental readings of an object's
apparent position to determine the distance to the object and its velocity.
This method is then applied to the simulation of Gamow's cyclist, producing
self-consistent results.

developed, which involve the discretisation of the internal energy equation,
with corrective terms to ensure the correct capture of shocks, and, more
generally, the consistency in the Lax-Wendroff sense. These schemes may be
staggered or colocated, using either struc-tured meshes or general simplicial
or tetrahedral/hexahedral meshes. The time discretization is performed by
fractional-step algorithms; these may be either based on semi-implicit pressure
correction techniques or segregated in such a way that only explicit steps are
involved (referred to hereafter as ""explicit"" variants). In order to ensure the
positivity of the density, the internal energy and the pressure, the discrete
convection operators for the mass and internal energy balance equations are
carefully designed; they use an upwind technique with respect to the material
velocity only. The construction of the fluxes thus does not need any Rie-mann
or approximate Riemann solver, and yields easily implementable algorithms. The
stability is obtained without restriction on the time step for the pressure
correction scheme and under a CFL-like condition for explicit variants:
preservation of the integral of the total energy over the computational domain,
and positivity of the density and the internal energy. The semi-implicit
first-order upwind scheme satisfies a local discrete entropy inequality. If a
MUSCL-like scheme is used in order to limit the scheme diffusion, then a weaker
property holds: the entropy inequality is satisfied up to a remainder term
which is shown to tend to zero with the space and time steps, if the discrete
solution is controlled in L $\infty$ and BV norms. The explicit upwind variant
also satisfies such a weaker property, at the price of an estimate for the
velocity which could be derived from the introduction of a new stabilization
term in the momentum balance. Still for the explicit scheme, with the
above-mentioned MUSCL-like scheme, the same result only holds if the ratio of
the time to the space step tends to zero.

we propose a new approach to train decoders to regress the word embedding of

attractive elastic force is activated. Particle transport and adhesion are
characterized in terms of their ability to reach the capillary peripheries

strength of their adhesive coating is varied (s = 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0) to

the conditions (e.g., environment, equipment) that were precisely specified,
the facts (e.g., observations) in the statements may no longer be valid. One
biological statement has one or multiple fact(s) and/or condition(s). Their
subject and object can be either a concept or a concept's attribute. Existing
information extraction methods do not consider the role of condition in the
biological statement nor the role of attribute in the subject/object. In this
work, we design a new tag schema and propose a deep sequence tagging framework
to structure conditional statement into fact and condition tuples from
biological text. Experiments demonstrate that our method yields a
information-lossless structure of the literature.

person's ability to hear, socialize and communicate. Overall, ASD has a broad
range of symptoms and severity; hence the term spectrum is used. One of the
main contributors to ASD is known to be genetics. Up to date, no suitable cure
for ASD has been found. Early diagnosis is crucial for the long-term treatment
of ASD, but this is challenging due to the lack of a proper objective measures.
Subjective measures often take more time, resources, and have false positives

help in diagnosing this disease early as possible with less effort.
  EEG measures the electric signals of the brain via electrodes placed on
various places on the scalp. These signals can be used to study complex
neuropsychiatric issues. Studies have shown that EEG has the potential to be

substantial benefits to the society as a whole. However, these systems may also
enclose potential conflicts and unintended consequences. Notably, people will
tend to adopt an A.I. system if it confers them an advantage, at which point
non-adopters might push for a strong regulation if that advantage for adopters
is at a cost for them. Here we propose an agent-based game-theoretical model
for these conflicts, where agents may decide to resort to A.I. to use and
acquire additional information on the payoffs of a stochastic game, striving to
bring insights from simulation to what has been, hitherto, a mostly
philosophical discussion. We frame our results under the current discussion on
ethical A.I. and the conflict between individual and societal gains: the
societal value alignment problem. We test the arising equilibria in the
adoption of A.I. technology under different norms followed by artificial
agents, their ensuing benefits, and the emergent levels of wealth inequality.
We show that without any regulation, purely selfish A.I. systems will have the
strongest advantage, even when a utilitarian A.I. provides significant benefits
for the individual and the society. Nevertheless, we show that it is possible
to develop A.I. systems following human conscious policies that, when
introduced in society, lead to an equilibrium where the gains for the adopters
are not at a cost for non-adopters, thus increasing the overall wealth of the
population and lowering inequality. However, as shown, a self-organised
adoption of such policies would require external regulation.

electrode theory model (or Newman model) of half-cell (dis)charge for an
electrode composed of uniformly sized spherical electrode particles of a single
chemistry. The derivation uses a formal asymptotic method based on the
disparity between the size of the thermal voltage and that of the
characteristic change in overpotential that occurs during (de)lithiation.
Comparison is made between solutions to the SPM and to the porous electrode
theory (PET) model for NMC, graphite and LFP. These are used to identify
regimes where the SPM gives accurate predictions. For most chemistries, even at
moderate (dis)charge rates, there are appreciable discrepancies between the PET
model and the SPM which can be attributed to spatial non-uniformities in the
electrolyte. This motivates us to calculate a correction term to the SPM. Once
this has been incorporated into the model its accuracy is significantly
improved. Generalised versions of the SPM, that can describe graded electrodes
containing multiple electrode particle sizes (or chemistries), are also
derived. The results of the generalised SPM, with the correction term, compare
favourably to the full PET model where the active electrode material is either
NMC or graphite.
