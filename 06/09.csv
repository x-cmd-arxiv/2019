viewpoints from different actors of the system: artists, collectors, galleries,
art scholars, data scientists. The writing process went as follows: a general
definition of the topic was put forward by two of the authors (Franceschet and
Colavizza), and used as reference to ask to a set of diverse authors to
contribute with their viewpoints asynchronously and independently. No
guidelines were offered before the first draft, if not to reach a minimum of
words to justify a separate section/contribution. Afterwards, all authors read
and commented on each other's work and minimal editing was done. Every author
was asked to suggest open questions and future perspectives on the topic of
crypto art from their vantage point, while keeping full control of their own
sections at all times. While this process does not necessarily guarantee the
uniformity expected from, say, a research article, it allows for multiple
voices to emerge and provide for a contribution on a common topic. The ending
section offers an attempt to pull all these threads together into a perspective
on the future of crypto art.

is crucial for quantum information tasks. We study a dissipative process
commonly used to describe dissipatively coupled systems and show that the
process can lead to pure unitary dynamics on one part of a bipartite system,
provided that the process is strong enough. If suitably engineered, the process
allows to implement generic unitary operations. In fact, we show within the
framework of quantum control theory that the dissipative process can turn the
system of interest into a system capable of universal quantum information task.
We characterize the time scales necessary to implement gates with high fidelity
through the dissipative evolution. The considered dissipative evolution is of
particular importance since it can be engineered in the laboratory in the realm
of superconducting circuits. Based on a reservoir that is formed by a lossy
microwave mode we present a detailed study of how our theoretical findings can
be realized in an experimental setting.

merging is more intrigue and little understood than the other. Here, we
construct a theoretical framework using the so-called restricted percolation

coalescence, clusters may move back and forth across the set boundary. The
inter-event time (IET) between two consecutive crossing times have two

without randomized experiments. This research direction draws increasing
attention in research areas such as economics, healthcare, and education. For
example, we can study how a medicine (the treatment) causally affects the
health condition (the outcome) of a patient using existing electronic health
records. To validate causal effects learned from observational data, we have to
control confounding bias -- the influence of variables which causally influence
both the treatment and the outcome. Existing work along this line
overwhelmingly relies on the unconfoundedness assumption that there do not
exist unobserved confounders. However, this assumption is untestable and can
even be untenable. In fact, an important fact ignored by the majority of
previous work is that observational data can come with network information that
can be utilized to infer hidden confounders. For example, in an observational
study of the individual-level treatment effect of a medicine, instead of
randomized experiments, the medicine is often assigned to each individual based
on a series of factors. Some of the factors (e.g., socioeconomic status) can be
challenging to measure and therefore become hidden confounders. Fortunately,
the socioeconomic status of an individual can be reflected by whom she is
connected in social networks. With this fact in mind, we aim to exploit the
network information to recognize patterns of hidden confounders which would
further allow us to learn valid individual causal effects from observational
data. In this work, we propose a novel causal inference framework, the network
deconfounder, which learns representations to unravel patterns of hidden
confounders from the network information. Empirically, we perform extensive
experiments to validate the effectiveness of the network deconfounder on
various datasets.

expected from the geometric effect of the jet edge entering our line of sight.
However, the favored optical post-break decline ($f_{\nu} \propto t^{-1.96 \pm
0.07}$) is also inconsistent with the $f_{\nu} \propto t^{-p}$ decline (where
$p \approx 2.3$ from the pre-break light curve), which is expected from
exponential lateral expansion of the jet; perhaps suggesting lateral expansion
that only affects a fraction of the jet. The post-break decline of GRB 160509A
is consistent with both the $t^{-3/4}$ steepening and with $f_{\nu} \propto
t^{-p}$. We also use {\sc boxfit} to fit afterglow models to both light curves
and find both to be energetically consistent with a millisecond magnetar
central engine, although the magnetar parameters need to be extreme (i.e. $E
\sim 3 \times 10^{52}$ erg). Finally, the late-time radio light curves of both
afterglows are not reproduced well by {\sc boxfit} and are inconsistent with
predictions from the standard jet model; instead both are well represented by a
single power law decline (roughly $f_{\nu} \propto t^{-1}$) with no breaks.
This requires a highly chromatic jet break ($t_{j,\mathrm{radio}} > 10 \times
t_{j,\mathrm{optical}}$) and possibly a two-component jet for both bursts.

attract each other. We calculate the phase diagram as a function of both the
volume fraction of the chains and the strength of the attractive potential. We
identify a large number of phases that include isotropic, nematic, smectic A,
smectic B and crystalline states. For tip attraction energies lower than the
thermal energy, our results are qualitatively consistent with experimental
findings: we find that an increase of the attraction strength shifts the
nematic to smectic A phase transition to lower volume fractions, with only
minor effect on the stability of the other phases. For sufficiently strong tip
attraction, the nematic phase disappears completely, in addition leading to the
destabilisation of the isotropic phase. In order to better understand the
underlying physics of these phenomena, we also investigate the clustering of
the particles at their attractive tips and the effective molecular field
experienced by the particles in the smectic A phase. Based on these results, we
argue that the clustering of the tips only affects the phase stability if
lamellar structures (``micelles'') are formed. We find that an increase of the
attraction strength increases the degree of order in the layered
phases.Interestingly, we also find evidence for the existence of an
anti-ferroelectric smectic A phase transition induced by the interaction
between the tips. A simple Maier-Saupe-McMillan model confirms our findings.

the Earth's turbulent atmosphere. The performance of tomographic adaptive
optics is strongly dependent on the vertical distribution (profile) of this
turbulence. An important way in which this manifests is the tomographic error,
arising from imperfect measurement and reconstruction of the turbulent phase at
altitude. Conventionally, a small number of reference profiles are used to
obtain this error in simulation however these profiles are not constructed to
be representative in terms of tomographic error. It is therefore unknown
whether these simulations are providing realistic performance estimates. Here,
we employ analytical adaptive optics simulation that drastically reduces
computation times to compute tomographic error for 10 691 measurements of the
turbulence profile gathered by the Stereo-SCIDAR instrument at ESO Paranal. We
assess for the first time the impact of the profile on tomographic error in a
statistical manner. We find, in agreement with previous work, that the
tomographic error is most directly linked with the distribution of turbulence
into discrete, stratified layers. Reference profiles are found to provide
mostly higher tomographic error than expected, which we attribute to the fact
that these profiles are primarily composed of averages of many measurements
resulting in unrealistic, continuous distributions of turbulence. We propose
that a representative profile should be defined with respect to a particular
system, and that as such simulations with a large statistical sample of
profiles must be an important step in the design process.

sequential decision making under uncertainty by seeking policies that are fully
adapted to the uncertainty. Often such flexible policies are not desirable, and
the decision maker may need to commit to a set of actions for a number of
planning periods. Two-stage stochastic programming might be better suited to
such settings, where the decisions for all periods are made here-and-now and do
not adapt to the uncertainty realized. In this paper, we propose a novel
alternative approach, where the stages are not predetermined but part of the
optimization problem. Each component of the decision policy has an associated
revision point, a period prior to which the decision is predetermined and after
which it is revised to adjust to the uncertainty realized thus far. We motivate
this setting using the multi-period newsvendor problem by deriving an optimal
adaptive policy. We label the proposed approach as adaptive two-stage
stochastic programming and provide a generic mixed-integer programming
formulation for finite stochastic processes. We show that adaptive two-stage
stochastic programming is NP-hard in general. Next, we derive bounds on the
value of adaptive two-stage programming in comparison to the two-stage and
multi-stage approaches for a specific problem structure inspired by the
capacity expansion planning problem. Since directly solving the mixed-integer
linear program associated with the adaptive two-stage approach might be very
costly for large instances, we propose several heuristic solution algorithms
based on the bound analysis. We provide approximation guarantees for these
heuristics. Finally, we present an extensive computational study on an
electricity generation capacity expansion planning problem and demonstrate the

$^{13}$CO (6--5) at selected positions. We analyze these data together with
previous CO (3--2) observations. In addition, we mapped the SiO (5--4) emission
in OMC-2 FIR 6. The CO (6--5) emission was detected in most of the outflow
lobes in the mapped regions, while the CO (7--6) was found mostly from the
OMC-3 outflows. In the OMC-3 MMS 5 outflow, a previously undetected extremely
high velocity gas was found in CO (6--5). This extremely high velocity emission
arises from the regions close to the central object MMS 5. Radiative transfer
models revealed that the high-velocity gas from MMS 5 outflow consists of gas
with $n_{\rm H_2}=$10$^4$--10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $T>$ 200 K, similar to what
is observed in young Class 0 low-mass protostars. For the other outflows,
values of $n_{\rm H_2}>$10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$ were found. The physical conditions
and kinematic properties of the young intermediate-mass outflows presented here
are similar to those found in outflows from Class 0 low-mass objects. Due to
their excitation requirements, mid$-J$ CO lines are good tracers of extremely
high velocity gas in young outflows likely related to jets.

latter performs an iterative diffusion in the feature space so that the

the learning of each task can be regularized and boosted by the complementary
task-level affinities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
the superiority of our method on the joint three tasks. Meanwhile, we achieve

enter into a runaway greenhouse state, where all surface water rapidly
evaporates, forming an optically thick H2O-dominated atmosphere. For Earth,
this extreme climate transition is thought to occur for a ~6% increase only of
the solar luminosity, though the exact limit at which the transition would
occur is still a highly debated topic. In general, the runaway greenhouse is
believed to be a fundamental process in the evolution of Earth-size, temperate
planets. Using 1-D radiative-convective climate calculations accounting for
thick, hot water vapour-dominated atmospheres, we evaluate the transit
atmospheric thickness of a post-runaway greenhouse atmosphere, and find that it
could possibly reach over a thousand kilometers (i.e., a few tens of % of Earth
radius). This abrupt radius inflation - resulting from the
runaway-greenhouse-induced transition - could be detected statistically by
ongoing and upcoming space missions such as TESS, CHEOPS and PLATO (combined
with precise radial velocity mass measurements with ground-based spectrographs
such as ESPRESSO, CARMENES or SPIRou), or even in particular cases in
multiplanetary systems such as TRAPPIST-1 (when masses and radii will be known
with good enough precision). This result provides the community with an
observational test of (1) the concept of runaway greenhouse, that defines the
inner edge of the traditional Habitable Zone, and the exact limit of the
runaway greenhouse transition. In particular, this could provide an empirical
measurement of the irradiation at which Earth analogs transition from a
temperate to a runaway greenhouse climate state. This astronomical measurement
would make it possible to statistically estimate how close Earth is from the

this very limit the monopole entropy assumes the form of an area-law,
strikingly similar to a black hole entropy in gravity. The phenomenon appears
universal and takes place for other solitons and non-perturbative objects. We
observe the same behaviour of entropy of a baryon in QCD with large number of
colors. These observations indicate that the area-law form of the entropy bound
extends beyond gravity and is deeply rooted in concepts of weak coupling and
perturbative unitarity. One provoked idea is that confinement in QCD may be

excellent initialization for bundle adjustment. A soft prior on the camera
poses is used to discourage large deviations from the spherical motion
assumption when performing bundle adjustment, which allows cameras to remain
properly constrained for optimization in the absence of well-triangulated 3D
points. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method we evaluate our
approach on both synthetic and real-world data, and demonstrate that camera
poses are accurate enough for multiview stereo.

state retrodiction for a system of optomechanical oscillators coupled to a

simultaneous optical measurement of the oscillators' transient dynamics at

reaching estimate sensitivity at the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). Simultaneous
estimation of the state of multiple oscillators places additional limits on the
estimate precision, due to the diffusive noise each oscillator adds to the

multi-mode state retrodiction reaches the SQL for sufficiently well-resolved

presented, which requires further accounting for technical fluctuations of the

localize ""the white truck in front of the yellow one"". To resolve this task
fundamentally, the model should first find out the contextual objects (e.g.,
the ""yellow"" truck) and then exploit them to disambiguate the referent from
other similar objects by using the attributes and relationships (e.g., ""white"",
""yellow"", ""in front of""). However, due to the lack of annotations on contextual
objects and their relationships, existing methods degenerate the above joint
grounding process into a holistic association between the expression and
regions, thus suffering from unsatisfactory performance and limited
interpretability. In this paper, we alleviate the missing-annotation problem
and enable the joint reasoning by leveraging the language scene graph which
covers both labeled referent and unlabeled contexts (other objects, attributes,
and relationships). Specifically, the language scene graph is a graphical
representation where the nodes are objects with attributes and the edges are
relationships. We construct a factor graph based on it and then perform
marginalization over the graph, such that we can ground both referent and
contexts on corresponding image regions to achieve the joint visual grounding
(JVG). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective
and interpretable, e.g., on three benchmarks, it outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods while offers a complete grounding of all the objects
mentioned in the referring expression.

design of different types of adversarial attacks. In particular, given a set of
risk sources, minimizing the worst-case attack loss can be reformulated as a
min-max problem by introducing domain weights that are maximized over the
probability simplex of the domain set. We showcase this unified framework in
three attack generation problems -- attacking model ensembles, devising
universal perturbation under multiple inputs, and crafting attacks resilient to
data transformations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach leads
to substantial attack improvement over the existing heuristic strategies as
well as robustness improvement over state-of-the-art defense methods trained to
be robust against multiple perturbation types. Furthermore, we find that the
self-adjusted domain weights learned from our min-max framework can provide a

less assumptions about the process. However, Fixed Rank Kriging requires the
estimation of a matrix which must be positive definite and the original

gauged supergravity model. The impact of the rotation parameter ($a$) and the
gauge coupling constant ($g$) on the behaviour of horizon and ergoregion of the
BH is studied. It is of interest to note that, compared with the extremal Kerr
BH, the gauge coupling constant, under certain constraints, can enhance the
maximum efficiency of energy extraction by the Penrose process almost double.
Under the same constraints, we can extract approximately 60.75\% of the initial
mass energy from the BH which is noticeably higher in contrast to the extremal
Kerr BH. The limit of energy extraction in terms of the local speeds of the
fragments is also examined with the help of the Wald inequality. We identify an
upper limit on the gauge coupling constant up to which the phenomenon of
Superradiance is likely to occur. Finally, we computed the center-of-mass
energy ($E_{CM}$) of two particles with the same rest masses moving in the
equatorial plane of the BH. Our study also aims to sensitize $E_{CM}$ to the
rotation parameter and the gauge coupling constant for extremal and nonextremal
spacetime as well. Especially, for the extremal case, an infinitely large
amount of $E_{CM}$ can be achieved closer to the horizon which allows the BH to
serve as a more powerful Planck-energy-scale collider as compared to Kerr and
any other generalized BHs in the Kerr family explored so far in general
relativity. However, $E_{CM}$ for the nonextremal spacetime is shown to be
finite and has an upper bound.

  Cooperative Fog Computing Networks","Final revision submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communications",,,,"cs.NI cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop a joint offloading and resource allocation framework for a
multi-layer cooperative fog computing network, aiming to minimize the total
energy consumption of multiple mobile devices subject to their service delay
requirements. The resulting optimization involves both binary (offloading
decisions) and real variables (resource allocations), making it an NP-hard and
computationally intractable problem. To tackle it, we first propose an improved
branch-and-bound algorithm (IBBA) that is implemented in a centralized manner.
However, due to the large size of the cooperative fog computing network, the
computational complexity of the proposed IBBA is relatively high. To speed up
the optimal solution searching as well as to enable its distributed
implementation, we then leverage the unique structure of the underlying problem
and the parallel processing at fog nodes. To that end, we propose a distributed
framework, namely feasibility finding Benders decomposition (FFBD), that
decomposes the original problem into a master problem for the offloading
decision and subproblems for resource allocation. The master problem (MP) is
then equipped with powerful cutting-planes to exploit the fact of resource
limitation at fog nodes. The subproblems (SP) for resource allocation can find
their closed-form solutions using our fast solution detection method. These
(simpler) subproblems can then be solved in parallel at fog nodes. The
numerical results show that the FFBD always returns the optimal solution of the
problem with significantly less computation time (e.g., compared with the
centralized IBBA approach). The FFBD with the fast solution detection method,
namely FFBD-F, can reduce up to $60\%$ and $90\%$ of computation time,
respectively, compared with those of the conventional FFBD, namely FFBD-S, and
IBBA.

describe the TIR object, which lack the sufficient discriminative capacity for

only trained on RGB images.To address this issue, we propose a multi-level
similarity model under a Siamese framework for robust TIR object tracking.
Specifically, we compute different pattern similarities on two convolutional
layers using the proposed multi-level similarity network. One of them focuses
on the global semantic similarity and the other computes the local structural
similarity of the TIR object. These two similarities complement each other and
hence enhance the discriminative capacity of the network for handling
distractors. In addition, we design a simple while effective relative entropy
based ensemble subnetwork to integrate the semantic and structural
similarities. This subnetwork can adaptive learn the weights of the semantic
and structural similarities at the training stage. To further enhance the
discriminative capacity of the tracker, we construct the first large scale TIR
video sequence dataset for training the proposed model. The proposed TIR
dataset not only benefits the training for TIR tracking but also can be applied
to numerous TIR vision tasks. Extensive experimental results on the VOT-TIR2015

be corrected for completeness and reliability. The final Kepler data release,
DR25, features a uniformly vetted planet candidate catalog and data products
that facilitate corrections. We present a new probabilistic approach to the
characterization of Kepler completeness and reliability, making full use of the
Kepler DR25 products. We illustrate the impact of completeness and reliability
corrections with a Poisson-likelihood occurrence rate method, using a recent
stellar properties catalog that incorporates Gaia stellar radii and essentially
uniform treatment of the stellar population. Correcting for reliability has a
significant impact: the exoplanet occurrence rate for orbital period and radius
within 20% of Earth's around GK dwarf stars, corrected for reliability, is
0.015+0.011-0.007, whereas not correcting results in 0.034+0.018-0.012 -
correcting for reliability reduces this occurrence rate by more than a factor
of two. We further show that using Gaia-based vs. DR25 stellar properties
impacts the same occurrence rate by a factor of two. We critically examine the
the DR25 catalog and the assumptions behind our occurrence rate method. We
propose several ways in which confidence in both the Kepler catalog and

is extended by three gauge singlet fermions and one additional scalar doublet,
all odd under an in-built $Z_2$ symmetry, the lightest singlet fermion which
also happens to be the lightest $Z_2$ odd particle, can be either thermal or
non-thermal DM candidate depending upon the strength of its couplings with SM
leptons and the $Z_2$ odd scalar doublet. In both the scenarios, the $Z_2$ odd
scalar doublet plays a non-trivial role either by assisting coannihilation with
thermal DM or by providing a source for non-thermal DM via decay. The heavier
$Z_2$ odd singlet fermion produces a net lepton asymmetry through its
out-of-equilibrium decay into SM leptons and $Z_2$ odd scalar doublet. We show
that the requirement of producing the observed baryon asymmetry pushes the
scale of leptogenesis in case of normal ordering of light neutrino masses to
several order of magnitudes above TeV scale. In case of inverted ordering
however, it is possible to have successful $N_2$ leptogenesis at a scale of few
tens of TeV. Inclusion of lepton flavour effects lowers this scale of
leptogenesis by around an order of magnitude in both the cases. Correct DM

minimizing true divergence between real and generated data up to a
multiplicative factor, and characterize this multiplicative factor as a
function of the statistics of the uncertain labels. Experiments on MNIST

accuracy in generating examples faithful to the class even with only a few

significant interest in the propagation of complex structures of light --

understanding of this research question has significantly grown over the last
two decades, outdoor-experiments with complex light structures are rare, and
comparisons with theory have been nearly lacking. Such situations show a
significant gap between theoretical models of atmospheric light behaviour and
current experimental effort. Here, in an attempt to reduce this gap, we
describe an interesting result of atmospheric models which are feasible for
empirical observation. We analyze in detail light propagation in different
spatial bases and present results of the theory that the influence of
atmospheric turbulence is basis-dependent. Concretely, light propagating as
eigenstate in one complete basis is stronger influenced by atmosphere than
light propagating in a different, complete basis. We obtain these results by
exploiting a family of the continuously adjustable, complete basis of spatial
modes -- the Ince-Gauss modes. Our concrete numerical results will hopefully
inspire experimental efforts and bring the theoretical and empirical study of
complex light patterns in realistic scenarios closer together.

attempt at explaining the micro-motion capabilities of these robots from a
modeling perspective. This paper presents the macro and micro motion kinematics
of a single segment continuum robot by using statics coupling effects among its
sub-segments. Experimental observations of the micro-scale motion demonstrate a
turning point behavior which could not be explained well using the current
modeling methods. We present a simplistic modeling approach that introduces two
calibration parameters to calibrate the moment coupling effects among the sub
segments of the robot. It is shown that these two parameters can reproduce the
turning point behavior at the micro-scale. The instantaneous macro and micro
scale kinematics Jacobians and the calibration parameters identification
Jacobian are derived. The modeling approach is verified against experimental
data showing that our simplistic modeling approach can capture the experimental
motion data with RMS position error of 5.82 micrometers if one wishes to fit
the entire motion profile with the turning point. If one chooses to exclude
motions past the turning point, our model can fit the experimental data with an

ranging measurements such as time of arrival (ToA), time difference of arrival

accurate and efficient embedding in a dynamic network scenario. To address this
issue, we present an efficient incremental skip-gram algorithm with negative

analyses to characterize the performance guarantee. Specifically, we first
partition a dynamic network into the updated, including addition/deletion of
links and vertices, and the retained networks over time. Then we factorize the
objective function of network embedding into the added, vanished and retained
parts of the network. Next we provide a new stochastic gradient-based method,
guided by the partitions of the network, to update the nodes and the parameter

with a bounded difference to that of the original objective function.
Experimental results show that our proposal can significantly reduce the

the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the practical usefulness of the
dynamic network embedding. We perform extensive experiments on multiple

Partial sharing models for cancel-on-complete and cancel-on-start redundancy

activity detection (rVAD). The method consists of two passes of denoising
followed by a voice activity detection (VAD) stage. In the first pass,
high-energy segments in a speech signal are detected by using a posteriori
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) weighted energy difference and if no pitch is
detected within a segment, the segment is considered as a high-energy noise
segment and set to zero. In the second pass, the speech signal is denoised by a
speech enhancement method, for which several methods are explored. Next,
neighbouring frames with pitch are grouped together to form pitch segments, and
based on speech statistics, the pitch segments are further extended from both
ends in order to include both voiced and unvoiced sounds and likely non-speech
parts as well. In the end, a posteriori SNR weighted energy difference is
applied to the extended pitch segments of the denoised speech signal for
detecting voice activity. We evaluate the VAD performance of the proposed
method using two databases, RATS and Aurora-2, which contain a large variety of
noise conditions. The rVAD method is further evaluated, in terms of speaker
verification performance, on the RedDots 2016 challenge database and its
noise-corrupted versions. Experiment results show that rVAD is compared
favourably with a number of existing methods. In addition, we present a
modified version of rVAD where computationally intensive pitch extraction is
replaced by computationally efficient spectral flatness calculation. The
modified version significantly reduces the computational complexity at the cost
of moderately inferior VAD performance, which is an advantage when processing a
large amount of data and running on low resource devices. The source code of
rVAD is made publicly available.

freedom - which are motivated from many high-energy embeddings - open up new
observational windows onto the physics of inflation. We construct a Bayesian
framework to statistically compare models with additional fields given the
current astronomical data. Putting inflation to the test, we perform our
analysis on the quadratic curvaton accompanying a range of inflationary
potentials, where we find that only one potential remains as a viable
candidate. Furthermore, if the curvaton mechanism were to be confirmed by
future non-Gaussianity measurements (from large scale structure surveys), the
model could prove to be tremendously informative of the early inflationary
history. The initial conditions given to these scalar fields become apparent
when considering their fundamentally quantum behaviour. Taking this physics
into account leads us to develop detailed models for post-inflationary
phenomenology (namely, the curvaton and freeze-in dark matter models) and to
discover powerful new probes of inflation itself. We further demonstrate how
this theoretical study complements our statistical approach by motivating the
prior information in our Bayesian analyses. The thesis finishes with a
discussion of the future prospects for inflationary model selection. By
hypothesising different toy survey configurations, we forecast different
outcomes using information theory and our newly developed Bayesian experimental
design formalism. In particular, we find that the most likely observable to
optimise model selection between single-field inflationary models, through an
order of magnitude precision improvement in the future, is the scalar spectral
index. We conclude with a summary of the results obtained throughout.

state trajectories of system dynamics. Most existing works on estimating ROA
rely on analytical Lyapunov functions, which are subject to two limitations:
the analytic Lyapunov functions may not be always readily available, and the
resulting ROA may be overly conservative. This work overcomes these two
limitations by leveraging the converse Lyapunov theorem in control theory to
eliminate the need of an analytic Lyapunov function and learning the unknown
Lyapunov function with the Gaussian Process (GP) approach. In addition, a
Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (GP-UCB) based sampling algorithm is
designed to reconcile the trade-off between the exploitation for enlarging the
ROA and the exploration for reducing the uncertainty of sampling region. Within
the constructed ROA, it is guaranteed in probability that the system state will
converge to the stable equilibrium with a confidence level. Numerical
simulations are also conducted to validate the assessment approach for the ROA
of the single machine infinite bus system and the New England $39$-bus system.
Numerical results demonstrate that our approach can significantly enlarge the
estimated ROA compared to that of the analytic Lyapunov counterpart.

90{\deg} switching. In subsequent ferroelectric switching, ferroelastic
switching is reduced by domain pinning and by the predominance of 180{\deg}
ferroelectric domains, as confirmed by polarized light microscopy. RUS under
in-situ electric field therefore demonstrates to be an effective technique for
the investigation of electromechanical coupling in ferroelectrics.

prohibitive to deploy on low-end devices. A promising high level approach
tackling this limitation is knowledge distillation, which let small student
model mimic cumbersome teacher model's output to get improved generalization.
However, related methods mainly focus on simple task of classification while do
not consider complex tasks like object detection. We show applying the vanilla
knowledge distillation to detection model gets minor gain. To address the
challenge of distilling knowledge in detection model, we propose a fine-grained
feature imitation method exploiting the cross-location discrepancy of feature
response. Our intuition is that detectors care more about local near object
regions. Thus the discrepancy of feature response on the near object anchor
locations reveals important information of how teacher model tends to
generalize. We design a novel mechanism to estimate those locations and let
student model imitate the teacher on them to get enhanced performance. We first
validate the idea on a developed lightweight toy detector which carries
simplest notion of current state-of-the-art anchor based detection models on
challenging KITTI dataset, our method generates up to 15% boost of mAP for the
student model compared to the non-imitated counterpart. We then extensively
evaluate the method with Faster R-CNN model under various scenarios with common

74% performance drop of student model compared to teacher. Codes released at

encode focussed proof search, and we show that the composition of the two

carefully composing with well-known embeddings of MALLw into MALL, we obtain a
similar delineation of MALL formulas, again carving out fragments complete for

that both MALLw and MALL are PSPACE-complete.
  A key insight is that we have to refine the usual presentation of focussing
to account for deterministic computations in proof search, which correspond to
invertible rules that do not branch. This is so that we may more faithfully
associate phases of focussed proof search to their alternating time complexity.
This presentation seems to uncover further dualities at the level of proof

construct energy stable schemes for phase field models. Both methods require an
assumption which the energy potential or energy is bounded from below. Under
this assumption, a positive constant $C$ need to be added to keep the square
root reasonable. However, it seems that it maybe more reasonable in both
physics and mathematics if the energy potential or energy is arbitrary.
Furthermore, if the bounded value from below is not obvious exactly, we are not
easy to give a proper constant $C$ before calculation. In this paper, by adding
a positive preserving function ($M(\phi)$ in IEQ and $E_0(\phi)$ in SAV )
instead of the positive constant in square root, we can improve this situation.

problems, where $k$ is the iteration counter. Our method does not require any
knowledge of neither convexity of the problem nor function parameters such as
Lipschitz constant of the gradient, i.e. it is adaptive to convexity and
smoothness and is uniformly optimal for smooth convex and non-convex problems.
Further, we develop its primal-dual modification for strongly convex problems
with linear constraints and prove the same $1/k^2$ for the primal objective
residual and constraints feasibility.

of a novel distributed event-triggered control and estimation strategy for DC
microgrids. The primary objective of this work is to efficiently stabilize the
grid voltage, and to further balance the energy level of the energy storage
(ES) systems. The locally-installed distributed controllers are utilised to
reduce the number of transmitted packets and battery usage of the installed
sensors, based on a proposed event-triggered communication scheme. Also, to
reduce the network traffic, an optimal observer is employed which utilizes a
modified Kalman consensus filter (KCF) to estimate the state of the DC
microgrid via the distributed sensors. Furthermore, in order to effectively
provide an intelligent data exchange mechanism for the proposed event-triggered
controller, the publish-subscribe communication model is employed to setup a
distributed control infrastructure in industrial wireless sensor networks
(WSNs). The performance of the proposed control and estimation strategy is
validated via the simulations of a DC microgrid composed of renewable energy
sources (RESs). The results confirm the appropriateness of the implemented
strategy for the optimal utilization of the advanced industrial network
architectures in the smart grids.

applications. However, this process is challenging due to the randomness and
slowness of the aging process. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a
comprehensive framework aimed at overcoming the challenges associated with
facial age estimation. First, we propose a novel age encoding method, referred
to as 'Soft-ranking', which encodes two important properties of facial age,
i.e., the ordinal property and the correlation between adjacent ages.
Therefore, Soft-ranking provides a richer supervision signal for training deep
models. Moreover, we also carefully analyze existing evaluation protocols for
age estimation, finding that the overlap in identity between the training and
testing sets affects the relative performance of different age encoding
methods. Finally, since existing face databases for age estimation are
generally small, deep models tend to suffer from an overfitting problem. To
address this issue, we propose a novel regularization strategy to encourage
deep models to learn more robust features from facial parts for age estimation
purposes. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed techniques improve
the age estimation performance; moreover, we achieve state-of-the-art
performance on the three most popular age databases, $i.e.$, Morph II,
CLAP2015, and CLAP2016.

natural and creative music pieces. In general, an analogy is made by partially
transferring the music abstractions, i.e., high-level representations and their

disentangling music representations, which usually takes little effort for
musicians but is non-trivial for computers. Three sub-problems arise:
extracting latent representations from the observation, disentangling the
representations so that each part has a unique semantic interpretation, and
mapping the latent representations back to actual music. In this paper, we
contribute an explicitly-constrained variational autoencoder (EC$^2$-VAE) as a
unified solution to all three sub-problems. We focus on disentangling the pitch
and rhythm representations of 8-beat music clips conditioned on chords. In
producing music analogies, this model helps us to realize the imaginary
situation of ""what if"" a piece is composed using a different pitch contour,
rhythm pattern, or chord progression by borrowing the representations from
other pieces. Finally, we validate the proposed disentanglement method using
objective measurements and evaluate the analogy examples by a subjective study.

estimations of crop production. Several approaches have been developed to get
early estimations of area and yield, the two components of crop production. The
most common methods, based on Earth observation data, are image classification
for crop area and correlation with vegetation index for crop yield. Regardless
of the approach used, early estimators of cropland area, crop area or crop
yield should have an accuracy providing lower production error than existing
historical crop statistics. The objective of this study is to develop a
methodological framework to define the accuracy requirements for early
estimators of cropland area, crop area and crop yield in Senegal. These
requirements are made according to (i) the inter-annual variability and the
trend of historical data, (ii) the calendar of official statistics data
collection, and (iii) the time at which early estimations of cropland area,
crop area and crop yield can theoretically be available. This framework is
applied to the seven main crops in Senegal using 20 years of crop production
data. Results show that the inter-annual variability of crop yield is the main
factor limiting the accuracy of pre-harvest production forecast. Estimators of
cropland area can be used to improve production prediction of groundnuts,
millet and rice, the three main crops in Senegal stressing the value of
cropland mapping for food security. While applied to Senegal, this study could
easily be reproduced in any country where reliable agricultural statistics are
available.

facets. Having introduced the local facets in Articles I to IV, we now show how
Article I's approach to Temporal Relationalism can be combined with Article
II's to Configurational Relationalism. This requires reformulating some of the
Principles of Dynamics to be Temporal Relationalism implementing, a strategy
which we follow through in each subsequent Article. All in all, around half of
the Principles of Dynamics needs to be rewritten to solve this noted,
50-year-old and hitherto unresolved foundational problem. This stands as
sufficient reason to render new resultant Principles of Dynamics - `TRiPoD' - a
significant and worthwhile development of the Principles of Dynamics. This
amounts to taking Jacobi's action principle more seriously than Jacobi himself
did, or any authors in between: to constitute a new starting point for the
entirety of the Principles of Dynamics is to be reworked. This can moreover be
viewed as a mild recategorization necessitated by the Problem of Time. While
mathematically simple to carry out, it requires quite a lot of conceptual
developments, by which it is both prudent and useful exposition to present this
first for finite rather than Field Theoretic examples in the current Article.
Article VI then extends this approach to Field Theory and GR.

mode collapse. In this work, we present an approach that involves the
prediction of several samples of the future with a winner-takes-all loss and
iterative grouping of samples to multiple modes. Moreover, we discuss how to

observations of the electromagnetic radiation in a wide range of wavelengths.
Only during the past two decades, new kinds of detectors have been developed,
exploiting other forms of cosmic probes: individual photons with energy above
the GeV, charged particles and antiparticles, neutrinos and, finally,
gravitational waves. These new ``telescopes'' leaded to unexpected
breakthroughs. Years 2016 and 2017 have seen the dawn of the astrophysics and
cosmology with gravitational waves, awarded with the 2017 Nobel Prize. The
events GW150914 (the first black hole-black hole merger) and GW170817 (the
coalescence of two neutron stars, producing a short gamma-ray burst and
follow-up observed by more than 70 observatories on all continents and in
space) represent really milestones in science that every physicist (senior or
in formation) should appreciate.
  In this document, after an accessible discussion on the generation and
propagation of GWs, the key features of observable quantities (the strain, the
GW frequency $\nu_{gw}$, and $\dot \nu_{gw}$) of GW150914 and GW170817 are
discussed using Newtonian physics, dimensional analysis and analogies with
electromagnetic waves. The objective is to show how astrophysical quantities
(the initial and final masses of merging objects, the energy loss, the
distance, their spin) are derived from observables. The results from the fully
general-relativistic analysis published in the two discovery papers are
compared with the output of our simple treatment. Then, some of the outcomes of
GW observations are discussed in terms of multimessenger astrophysics.

the implicit Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. For any implicit probabilistic

Metropolis-Hastings operates by learning a discriminator to estimate the

of density ratio introduces an error on every step of the chain, it is crucial
to analyze the stationary distribution of such chain. For that purpose, we

low-resolution (LR) PET, radial locations, axial locations, and HR MR. To
validate the CNN architectures, we performed both realistic simulation studies
using the BrainWeb digital phantom and clinical neuroimaging data analysis. For
both simulation and clinical studies, the LR PET images were based on the
Siemens HR+ scanner. Two different scenarios were examined in simulation: one
where the target HR image is the ground-truth phantom image and another where
the target HR image is based on the Siemens HRRT scanner --- a high-resolution
dedicated brain PET scanner. The latter scenario was also examined using
clinical neuroimaging datasets. A number of factors affected relative
performance of the different CNN designs examined, including network depth,
target image quality, and the resemblance between the target and anatomical
images. In general, however, all CNNs outperformed classical penalized
deconvolution techniques by large margins both qualitatively (e.g., edge and

the film. In our derivation, the idea is exploited that a physical boundary can
be looked upon as a region of rapid variation in polarization rather than a
simple geometric separation. With this no boundary conditions are needed in
solving the relevant electrostatics problem. Our approach makes it clear that
the responses consist of two contributions, one arising from the very presence
of surfaces while the other existing even in an infinite medium. The approach
can be applied not just to electrostatic but also many problems and is of great

In the second, a map of connected and pointed spaces is a weak equivalence if
it induces an isomorphism between fundamental groups and higher rationalized

this paper, we compare these two notions and show that $\pi_1$-rational

induce a quasi-isomorphism after applying the cobar functor to the dg

singular chains by using different algebraic notions of weak equivalences:
quasi-isomorphism and $\Omega$-quasi-isomorphisms. We further show that, in the

Compared to networks using standard group convolution, HGCNets have a huge
improvement in accuracy at the same model size and complexity level. Extensive
experimental results on the CIFAR dataset demonstrate that HGCNets obtain
significant reduction of parameters and computational cost to achieve
comparable performance over the prior CNN architectures designed for mobile

modeling the protein phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) on the temperature (T),

demonstrate a critical transition where phases merge, and PGK exhibits large
structural fluctuations. Above the critical temperature (Tc), the difference

the Tc moves to a lower T. We verify the calculations with experiments mapping
the T-P-$\phi$ space, which likewise reveal a critical point at 305 K and 170

critical line in its natural parameter space, where large conformational

research into the application of this social phenomenon has recently attracted
increasing attention. However, further exploration of the reasons behind the
weak-ties phenomenon is still challenging. Fortunately, data-driven network
science provides a novel way with substantial explanatory power to analyze the
causal mechanism behind social phenomenon. Inspired by this perspective, we
propose an approach to further explore the driving factors behind the temporal
weak-ties phenomenon. We find that the obvious intuition underlying the
weak-ties phenomenon is incorrect, and often large numbers of unknown mutual
friends associated with these weak ties is one of the key reason for the
emergence of the weak-ties phenomenon. In particular, for example scientific
collaborators with weak ties prefer to be involved in direct collaboration
rather than share ideas with mutual colleagues -- there is a natural tendency
to collapse short strong chains of connection.

proposed for equivalent wire-medium (WM) interfaces. The obtained ABCD matrices
for equivalent interfaces capture the non-local effects due to the evanescent
transverse magnetic (TM) WM mode and in part due to the propagating transverse
electromagnetic (TEM) WM mode. This enables one to characterize the overall
response of bounded WM structures by cascading the ABCD matrices of equivalent
WM interfaces and WM slabs as transmission lines supporting only the
propagating TEM WM mode, resulting in a simple circuit-model formalism for
bounded WM structures with arbitrary terminations, including the open-end,
patch/slot arrays, and thin metal/2D material, among others. The individual
ABCD matrices for equivalent WM interfaces apparently violate the conservation
of energy and reciprocity, and therefore, the equivalent interfaces apparently
behave as non-reciprocal lossy or active systems. However, the overall response
of a bounded WM structure is consistent with the lossless property maintaining
the conservation of energy and reciprocity. These unusual features are
explained by the fact that in the non-local WM the Poynting vector has an
additional correction term which takes into account a ""hidden power"" due to
non-local effects. Results are obtained for various numerical examples
demonstrating a rapid and efficient solution for bounded WM structures,
including the case of geometrically complex multilayer configurations with
arbitrary terminations, subject to the condition that WM interfaces are
decoupled by the evanescent TM WM mode below the plasma frequency.

a local model formalism and accurately predicts the response of WM structures

interaction of propagating and evanescent waves with WM structures. In

models for multi-label text classification consider either the non-consecutive

them both coherently is less studied. In addition, most existing methods treat
output labels as independent methods, but ignore the hierarchical relations
among them, leading to useful semantic information loss. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical taxonomy-aware and attentional graph capsule
recurrent CNNs framework for large-scale multi-label text classification.
Specifically, we first propose to model each document as a word order preserved
graph-of-words and normalize it as a corresponding words-matrix representation
which preserves both the non-consecutive, long-distance and local sequential
semantics. Then the words-matrix is input to the proposed attentional graph
capsule recurrent CNNs for more effectively learning the semantic features. To
leverage the hierarchical relations among the class labels, we propose a
hierarchical taxonomy embedding method to learn their representations, and
define a novel weighted margin loss by incorporating the label representation
similarity. Extensive evaluations on three datasets show that our model
significantly improves the performance of large-scale multi-label text
classification by comparing with state-of-the-art approaches.

XXZ-type magnetic van der Waals materials. Here, we investigated the magnetic
ordering of MnPS3, a two-dimensional antiferromagnetic material of
Heisenberg-type, by Raman spectroscopy from bulk all the way down to bilayer.
The phonon modes that involve the vibrations of Mn ions exhibit characteristic
changes as the temperature gets lowered through the N\'eel temperature. In bulk
MnPS3, the Raman peak at ~155 cm-1 becomes considerably broadened near the
N\'eel temperature and upon further cooling is subsequently red-shifted. The
measured peak positions and polarization dependences of the Raman spectra are
in excellent agreement with our first-principles calculations. In few-layer
MnPS3, the peak at ~155 cm-1 exhibits the characteristic red-shift at low
temperatures down to the bilayer, indicating that the magnetic ordering is
surprisingly stable at such a thin limit. Our work sheds light on the hitherto
unexplored magnetic ordering in the Heisenberg-type antiferromagnetic systems

idea of AI was first proposed. One common theme in these discussions is the
thesis that the ability of a machine to conduct convincing dialogues with human
beings can serve as at least a sufficient criterion of AGI. We argue that this
very ability should be accepted also as a necessary condition of AGI, and we
provide a description of the nature of human dialogue in particular and of
human language in general against this background. We then argue that it is for
mathematical reasons impossible to program a machine in such a way that it
could master human dialogue behaviour in its full generality. This is (1)
because there are no traditional explicitly designed mathematical models that
could be used as a starting point for creating such programs; and (2) because
even the sorts of automated models generated by using machine learning, which
have been used successfully in areas such as machine translation, cannot be
extended to cope with human dialogue. If this is so, then we can conclude that
a Turing machine also cannot possess AGI, because it fails to fulfil a
necessary condition thereof. At the same time, however, we acknowledge the
potential of Turing machines to master dialogue behaviour in highly restricted

singled out as a major AI challenge problem. Recently there has been a series
of breakthroughs culminating in agents that have successfully defeated the
strongest human players in two-player no-limit Texas hold 'em. The strongest
agents are based on algorithms for approximating Nash equilibrium strategies,
which are stored in massive binary files and unintelligible to humans. A recent
line of research has explored approaches for extrapolating knowledge from
strong game-theoretic strategies that can be understood by humans. This would
be useful when humans are the ultimate decision maker and allow humans to make
better decisions from massive algorithmically-generated strategies. Using
techniques from machine learning we have uncovered a new simple, fundamental
rule of poker strategy that leads to a significant improvement in performance
over the best prior rule and can also easily be applied by human players.

  Classification","4 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning models have a large number of freeparameters that need to be
calculated by effective trainingof the models on a great deal of training data
to improvetheir generalization performance. However, data obtaining andlabeling
is expensive in practice. Data augmentation is one of themethods to alleviate
this problem. In this paper, we conduct apreliminary study on how three
variables (augmentation method,augmentation rate and size of basic dataset per
label) can affectthe accuracy of deep learning for image classification. The
studyprovides some guidelines: (1) it is better to use transformationsthat
alter the geometry of the images rather than those justlighting and color. (2)
2-3 times augmentation rate is good enoughfor training. (3) the smaller amount
of data, the more obviouscontributions could have.

  Networks","CVPR 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite recent advancements in deep learning-based automatic colorization,
they are still limited when it comes to few-shot learning. Existing models
require a significant amount of training data. To tackle this issue, we present
a novel memory-augmented colorization model MemoPainter that can produce
high-quality colorization with limited data. In particular, our model is able
to capture rare instances and successfully colorize them. We also propose a
novel threshold triplet loss that enables unsupervised training of memory
networks without the need of class labels. Experiments show that our model has
superior quality in both few-shot and one-shot colorization tasks.

size and complexity of the object-oriented source code. The tag cloud is a
simple and popular visualization technique. The main idea of the tag cloud is
to represent tags according to their frequency in an alphabetical order where
the most important tags are highlighted via a suitable font size. This paper
proposes an original approach to visualize software code using a tag cloud. The
approach exploits all software identifier names to visualize software code as a
tag cloud. Experiments were conducted on several case studies. To validate the
approach, it is applied on NanoXML and ArgoUML. The results of this evaluation
validate the relevance and the performance of the proposed approach as all tag
names and their frequencies were correctly identified. The proposed tag cloud
visualization technique is a helpful addition to the software visualization
toolkit. The extracted tag cloud supports software engineers as they filter and
browse data.
