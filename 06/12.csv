This is the case,
for instance, in remote sensing and astronomy, where projects produce several
petabytes of data every year. While machine learning models are often trained
on relatively small subsets of the data, the inference phase typically requires
transferring significant amounts of data between the servers and the clients.
In many cases, the bandwidth available per user is limited, which then renders
the data transfer to be one of the major bottlenecks. In this work, we propose
a framework that automatically selects the relevant parts of the input data for
a given neural network. The model as well as the associated selection masks are
trained simultaneously such that a good model performance is achieved while
only a minimal amount of data is selected. During the inference phase, only
those parts of the data have to be transferred between the server and the
client. We propose both instance-independent and instance-dependent selection
masks. The former ones are the same for all instances to be transferred,
whereas the latter ones allow for variable transfer sizes per instance. Our
experiments show that it is often possible to significantly reduce the amount
of data needed to be transferred without affecting the model quality much.

a quantity associated with triples of points which is still invariant under the

Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is the metric most widely used to implement pattern
query, but its computational complexity is a well-known issue. In this paper we
present an approach aimed at learning a kernel able to approximate DTW to be
used for efficiently analyse streaming data collected from wearable sensors,
reducing the burden of computation. Contrary to kernel, DTW allows for
comparing time series with different length. Thus, to use a kernel, a feature
embedding is used to represent a time-series as a fixed length vector. Each
vector component is the DTW between the given time-series and a set of 'basis'
series, usually randomly chosen. The vector size is the number of basis series
used for the feature embedding. Searching for the portion of the data stream
minimizing the DTW with the reference subsequence leads to a global
optimization problem. The proposed approach has been validated on a benchmark
dataset related to the identification of users depending on their walking
activity. A comparison with a traditional DTW implementation is also provided.

a Poisson point process in time and space, each with a file to transmit to the

interference plus noise ratio, where the interference is from other active
users in the cell. Once the file is fully transmitted, the user leaves the

which is independent of the specific bounded path loss function. A novel
observation is that for a certain range of arrival rates, the network appears
stable for a possibly long time, and then suddenly exhibits instability. This
property, which is known in statistical physics but rarely observed in wireless
communication, is called metastability. Finally, we propose two heuristic
characterizations based on mean-field interpretation, of the network
steady-state regime when it exists. The first-order approximation is very
simple to compute, but loose in some regimes, whereas the second-order

The most relevant is 5-10 times smaller length compared to air-gap polarizers

SM polarizer is the matching of the substrate SLD (Scattering Length Density)
with the SM coating SLD for spin-down neutrons. For traditional Fe/Si SM on Si
substrate, this SLD step is positive when a neutron goes from the substrate to
the SM, which leads to a significant loss of the polarizer performance at small
Q. Instead, we use single-crystal Sapphire/Quartz substrates. The latter show a
negative SLD step for spin-down neutrons at the interface with Fe and,
therefore, avoid the total reflection regime at small Q. To optimize the
polarizer performance, we formulate the concept of Sapphire V-bender, perform
ray-tracing simulations of Sapphire V-bender, compare results with those for
traditional C-bender on Si, and study experimentally V-bender prototypes with
different substrates. Our results show that the choice of substrate material,
polarizer geometry and the strength and quality of magnetizing field have
dramatic effect. In particular, we compare the performance of polarizer for the
applied magnetic field strength of $50 mT$ and $300 mT$. Only the large field
strength provides an excellent agreement between the simulated and measured
polarization values. For the double-collision configuration, a record
polarization $>0.999$ was obtained in the neutron wavelength band of $0.3-1.2

the clear mechanism of the switching behavior of $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ N\'eel
order among three stable states. We also show that the observed ""saw-tooth""
Hall resistance is due to an artifact of Pt, not AF switching, while the
signature of AF switching is step-like Hall signals. This demonstration of
electrical control of magnetic moments in AF insulator (AFI) films will greatly
expand the scope of AF spintronics by leveraging the large family of AFIs.

interstellar medium increases, it becomes important to place meaningful
constraints on the formation pathways of these species. The molecular cloud
SgrB2(N) is host to several hot molecular cores in the early stage of star
formation, where a great variety of COMs are detected in the gas phase. Because
of its exposure to the extreme conditions of the the Galactic center region,
SgrB2(N) is one of the best targets to study the impact of environmental
conditions on the production of COMs. Our main goal is to characterize the
physico-chemical evolution of SgrB2(N)'s sources in order to explain their
chemical differences and constrain their environmental conditions. The chemical
composition of SgrB2(N)'s hot cores, N2, N3, N4, and N5 is derived by modeling
their 3mm emission spectra extracted from the EMoCA imaging spectral line
survey performed with ALMA. We derive the density distribution in the envelope
of the sources based on the masses computed from the ALMA dust continuum
emission maps. We use the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D to compute
temperature profiles based on the COM rotational temperatures derived from
population diagrams. We use published results of 3D RMHD simulations of
high-mass star formation to estimate the time evolution of the sources
properties. We employ the chemical code MAGICKAL to compute time-dependent
chemical abundances in the sources and investigate how physical properties and
environmental conditions influence the production of COMs. We find that
chemical models with a cosmic-ray ionization rate of 7e-16s-1 best reproduce
the abundances with respect to methanol of ten COMs observed toward
SgrB2(N2-N5). We also show that COMs still form efficiently on dust grains with
minimum dust temperatures in the prestellar phase as high as 15K, but that
minimum temperatures higher than 25K are excluded.

chirality, and porosity concentration are investigated. Our results indicate
that the thermal conductivity of NPG is about two orders smaller compared with

material. Also, the porosity concentration helps us to tune the thermal
conductivity. Moreover, the results show that the thermal conductivity
increases with growing sample length due to ballistic transport. On the other
hand, along the armchair direction, the thermal conductivity is larger than
zigzag direction. We also examined the thermal properties of the interface of
NPG and graphene. The temperature drops significantly through the interface
leading to the thermal resistance. The thermal resistance changes with imposed
heat flux direction, and this difference cause significantly large thermal
rectification factor, and heat current prefers one direction to another.
Besides, to investigate those quantities fundamentally, we study the phonon
density of states and scattering of them.

prerequisite for evaluation of brain development. However, automatic
segmentation is often hampered by motion artifacts caused by infant head
movements during image acquisition. Methods have been developed to remove or
minimize these artifacts during image reconstruction using frequency domain
data. However, frequency domain data might not always be available. Hence, in
this study we propose a method for removing motion artifacts from the already
reconstructed MR scans. The method employs a generative adversarial network
trained with a cycle consistency loss to transform slices affected by motion
into slices without motion artifacts, and vice versa. In the experiments 40
T2-weighted coronal MR scans of preterm born infants imaged at 30 weeks
postmenstrual age were used. All images contained slices affected by motion
artifacts hampering automatic tissue segmentation. To evaluate whether
correction allows more accurate image segmentation, the images were segmented
into 8 tissue classes: cerebellum, myelinated white matter, basal ganglia and
thalami, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, brain stem, cortical
gray matter, and extracerebral cerebrospinal fluid. Images corrected for motion
and corresponding segmentations were qualitatively evaluated using 5-point
Likert scale. Before the correction of motion artifacts, median image quality
and quality of corresponding automatic segmentations were assigned grade 2
(poor) and 3 (moderate), respectively. After correction of motion artifacts,
both improved to grades 3 and 4, respectively. The results indicate that
correction of motion artifacts in the image space using the proposed approach
allows accurate segmentation of brain tissue classes in slices affected by
motion artifacts.

such a subset in $O(n^2d^2)$ time and thus not used in practice. Our algorithm
computes this subset in $O(nd+d^4\log{n})$ time, using $O(\log n)$ calls to
Caratheodory's construction on small but ""smart"" subsets. This is based on a
novel paradigm of fusion between different data summarization techniques, known

function and robust mass estimates. The Euclid wide survey will cover 15000

in the $H$-band. The resulting data will make it possible to detect a large
number of galaxy clusters spanning a wide-range of masses up to redshift $\sim
2$. This paper presents the final results of the Euclid Cluster Finder
Challenge (CFC). The objective of these challenges was to select the cluster
detection algorithms that best meet the requirements of the Euclid mission. The
final CFC included six independent detection algorithms, based on different
techniques, such as photometric redshift tomography, optimal filtering,
hierarchical approach, wavelet and friend-of-friends algorithms. These
algorithms were blindly applied to a mock galaxy catalog with representative
Euclid-like properties. The relative performance of the algorithms was assessed
by matching the resulting detections to known clusters in the simulations.
Several matching procedures were tested, thus making it possible to estimate
the associated systematic effects on completeness to $<3$%. All the tested
algorithms are very competitive in terms of performance, with three of them
reaching $>80$% completeness for a mean purity of 80% down to masses of
$10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ and up to redshift $z=2$. Based on these results, two
algorithms were selected to be implemented in the Euclid pipeline, the AMICO
code, based on matched filtering, and the PZWav code, based on an adaptive
wavelet approach. [abridged]

collected by ProPublica in 2016 that fueled intense debate and research in the
nascent field of 'algorithmic fairness'. ProPublica's COMPAS data is used in an
increasing number of studies to test various definitions of algorithmic
fairness. This paper takes a closer look at the actual datasets put together by
ProPublica. In particular, the sub-datasets built to study the likelihood of
recidivism within two years of a defendant's original COMPAS survey screening
date. I take a new yet simple approach to visualize these data, by analyzing
the distribution of defendants across COMPAS screening dates. I find that
ProPublica made an important data processing error when it created these
datasets, failing to implement a two-year sample cutoff rule for recidivists in
such datasets (whereas it implemented a two-year sample cutoff rule for
non-recidivists). When I implement a simple two-year COMPAS screen date cutoff
rule for recidivists, I estimate that in the two-year general recidivism
dataset ProPublica kept over 40% more recidivists than it should have. This
fundamental problem in dataset construction affects some statistics more than
others. It obviously has a substantial impact on the recidivism rate;
artificially inflating it. For the two-year general recidivism dataset created
by ProPublica, the two-year recidivism rate is 45.1%, whereas, with the simple

acoustically, because the signal from alpha events is consistently larger in

early stage of development. The cornerstone of volumetric and morphologic
analysis in fetal MRI is segmentation of the fetal brain into different tissue
classes. Manual segmentation is cumbersome and time consuming, hence automatic
segmentation could substantially simplify the procedure. However, automatic
brain tissue segmentation in these scans is challenging owing to artifacts
including intensity inhomogeneity, caused in particular by spontaneous fetal
movements during the scan. Unlike methods that estimate the bias field to
remove intensity inhomogeneity as a preprocessing step to segmentation, we
propose to perform segmentation using a convolutional neural network that
exploits images with synthetically introduced intensity inhomogeneity as data
augmentation. The method first uses a CNN to extract the intracranial volume.
Thereafter, another CNN with the same architecture is employed to segment the
extracted volume into seven brain tissue classes: cerebellum, basal ganglia and
thalami, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, brain stem, cortical
gray matter and extracerebral cerebrospinal fluid. To make the method
applicable to slices showing intensity inhomogeneity artifacts, the training
data was augmented by applying a combination of linear gradients with random
offsets and orientations to image slices without artifacts.

non-trivial task, frequently leading to either significant performance
reduction or engineering time spent on training a network to be amenable to
quantization. Our approach relies on equalizing the weight ranges in the

In addition the method corrects biases in the error that are introduced during
quantization. This improves quantization accuracy performance, and can be
applied to many common computer vision architectures with a straight forward

subsets (pore throats). Lattice Boltzmann simulations are performed for each
pore throat to determine the hydrodynamic properties (entry capillary pressure,
primary drainage curve, liquid morphology, etc) at the microscale. The local

is of high mass ($\sim$1.06 M$_\odot$) and its colours are very peculiar ---
particularly the redder ones ($r$, $i$, $z$ and $y$), which suggest that it has
a late-type companion. This is the only magnetized, detached binary white dwarf

in-the-wild images from semantic label maps. Our approach is dramatically
different from recent work in this space, in that we make use of no learning.
Instead, our approach uses simple but classic tools for matching scene context,
shapes, and parts to a stored library of exemplars. Though simple, this
approach has several notable advantages over recent work: (1) because nothing
is learned, it is not limited to specific training data distributions (such as
cityscapes, facades, or faces); (2) it can synthesize arbitrarily
high-resolution images, limited only by the resolution of the exemplar library;
(3) by appropriately composing shapes and parts, it can generate an
exponentially large set of viable candidate output images (that can say, be
interactively searched by a user). We present results on the diverse COCO
dataset, significantly outperforming learning-based approaches on standard
image synthesis metrics. Finally, we explore user-interaction and
user-controllability, demonstrating that our system can be used as a platform
for user-driven content creation.

spectrum with multi-TeV squarks and SU(2) scalar singlets as well as the
decoupling limit in the SUSY Higgs sector. In this case the lightest CP-even
Higgs is SM-like when R-parity is conserved. In contrast, we show that when
R-parity violating interactions are added to the SUSY framework, significant
deviations may occur in some production and decay channels of the 125 GeV
Higgs-like state. Indeed, we assume a single-flavor (mostly third generation)
Bilinear RPV (BRPV) interactions, which generate Higgs-sneutrino mixing,
lepton-chargino mixing and neutrino-neutralino mixing, and find that notable
deviations of ${\cal O}(20-30\%)$ may be expected in the Higgs signal strength
observables in some channels, e.g., in $p p \to h \to \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+
\tau^-$. Moreover, we find that new and detectable signals associated with BRPV
Higgs decays to gauginos, $h\rightarrow\nu_{\tau}\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}$ and
$h\rightarrow\tau^{\pm}\chi_{2}^{\mp}$, may also arise in this scenario. These
decays yield a typical signature of $h \to \tau^\pm \ell^\mp + {{\not\!\!

also be accompanied by an ${\cal O}(20-30\%)$ enhancement in the di-photon

signals of Trilinear R-parity violation (TRPV) interactions in the production
and decays of the Higgs-sneutrino BRPV mixed state (assuming it is the 125 GeV
scalar) and show that, in this case also, large deviations up to ${\cal

cluster galaxy (BCG) located at the centre of the X-ray luminous cool core
cluster Abell 2667 (z = 0.2343). The bi-dimensional modelling of the BCG
surface brightness profile reveals the presence of a complex system of
substructures extending all around the galaxy. Clumps of different size and
shape plunged into a more diffuse component constitute these substructures,
whose intense 'blue' optical colour hints to the presence of a young stellar
population. Our results depict the BCG as a massive (M_star ~ 1.38 x 10^11
M_sun) dispersion-supported spheroid (v_star < 150 km/s, sigma_0 ~ 216 km/s)
hosting an active supermassive black hole (M_SMBH ~ 3.8 x 10^9 M_sun) whose
optical features are typical of low ionisation nuclear emission line regions.
Although the velocity pattern of the stars in the BCG is irregular, the stellar
kinematics in the regions of the clumps show a positive velocity of ~ 100 km/s,
similarly to the gas component. An analysis of the mechanism giving rise to the
observed lines in the clumps through empirical diagnostic diagrams points out
that the emission is composite, suggesting the contribution from both star
formation and AGN. We conclude our analysis describing how scenarios of both
chaotic cold accretion and merging with a gas-rich disc galaxy can
efficaciously explain the phenomena the BCG is undergoing.

superconductivity prevents the onset of low-temperature quantum criticality,
reminiscent of the behavior in several heavy-electron and iron-based materials.
At strong coupling, pairing of highly incoherent fermions sets in deep in the
Non-Fermi liquid regime, a behavior qualitatively similar to that in underdoped
cuprate superconductors. The pairing of incoherent time-reversal partners is
protected by a mechanism similar to Anderson's theorem for disordered
superconductors. The superconducting ground state is characterized by coherent
quasiparticle excitations and higher-order bound states thereof, revealing that
it is no longer an ideal gas of Cooper pairs, but a strongly coupled pair
fluid. The normal-state incoherency primarily acts to suppress the weight of

parameters, and possibly even properties of gravity. Such a measurement is,
however, complicated by the fact that the surroundings of galaxy clusters are
not spherical, but instead are a complicated collection of filaments, sheets

We find that for a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology these error-bars are typically of the
order of $20\%$. We numerically simulate three different implementations of
dark energy models and of a scalar dark sector interaction to address whether
the turn-around radius can be used to constrain non-trivial cosmologies, and we
find that only rather extreme models can be distinguished from a $\Lambda$CDM

material classification of unresolved space debris using a multispectral
rotating point spread function (RPSF). The use of RPSF allows one to estimate
the 3D locations of point sources from their rotated images acquired by a
single 2D sensor array, since the amount of rotation of each source image about
its x, y location depends on its axial distance z. Using multi-spectral images,
with one RPSF per spectral band, we are able not only to localize the 3D
positions of the space debris but also classify their material composition. We
propose a three-stage method for achieving joint localization and
classification. In Stage 1, we adopt an optimization scheme for localization in
which the spectral signature of each material is assumed to be uniform, which
significantly improves efficiency and yields better localization results than
possible with a single spectral band. In Stage 2, we estimate the spectral
signature and refine the localization result via an alternating approach. We
process classification in the final stage. Both Poisson noise and Gaussian
noise models are considered, and the implementation of each is discussed.
Numerical tests using multispectral data from NASA show the efficiency of our
three-stage approach and illustrate the improvement of point source
localization and spectral classification from using multiple bands over a

UV-optical filters. The final sample includes $\sim$1400 clumps, of which
$\sim$600 have magnitude uncertainties below 0.3 in all filters. The UV
luminosity function for the total sample of clumps is described by a power-law
with slope $\alpha = -2.03^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$. Clumps in the LARS galaxies have
on average $\Sigma_{SFR}$ values higher than what observed in HII regions of
local galaxies and comparable to typical SFR densities of clumps in z = 1-3
galaxies. We derive the clumpiness as the relative contribution from clumps to
the UV emission of each galaxy, and study it as a function of galactic-scale
properties, i.e. $\Sigma_{SFR}$ and the ratio between rotational and dispersion
velocities of the gas ($v_s/\sigma_0$). We find that in galaxies with higher

specifically consider the effect of a spatially and temporally finite,

Kolmogorov's $E(q)\sim q^{-5/3}$ scaling of the kinetic energy spectrum of
inertial turbulence with the wave vector $q$. In recent years, active fluids
have been shown to exhibit turbulent-like flows at low Reynolds number.
However, the existence of universal scaling properties in these flows has
remained unclear. To address this issue, here we propose a minimal defect-free
hydrodynamic theory for two-dimensional active nematic fluids at vanishing
Reynolds number. By means of large-scale simulations and analytical arguments,
we show that the kinetic energy spectrum exhibits a universal scaling $E(q)\sim
q^{-1}$ at long wavelengths. We find that the energy injection due to activity
has a peak at a characteristic length scale, which is selected by a nonlinear
mechanism. In contrast to inertial turbulence, energy is entirely dissipated at
the scale where it is injected, thus precluding energy cascades. Nevertheless,
the non-local character of the Stokes flow establishes long-ranged velocity
correlations, which lead to the scaling behavior. We conclude that active
nematic fluids define a distinct universality class of turbulence at low
Reynolds number.

globular clusters (GCs) retain a dynamical memory of this transformation. To
test this, we use the nbody6df code to simulate the dynamical evolution of GCs,
including stellar evolution, orbiting in static and time-varying potentials for
a Hubble time. We find that GCs orbiting within a cored dark matter halo, or
within a halo that has undergone a cusp-core transformation, grow to a size
that is substantially larger ($R_{\rm eff} > 10$ pc) than those in a static
cusped dark matter halo. They also produce much less tidal debris. We find that
the cleanest signal of an historic cusp-core transformation is the presence of
large GCs with tidal debris. However, the effect is small and will be
challenging to observe in real galaxies. Finally, we qualitatively compare our
simulated GCs with the observed GC populations in the Fornax, NGC 6822, IKN and
Sagittarius dwarf galaxies. We find that the GCs in these dwarf galaxies are
systematically larger ($\langle R_{\rm eff}\rangle \simeq 7.8$ pc), and have
substantially more scatter in their sizes, than in-situ metal rich GCs in the

probability distributions. Our procedure pools the data from the different

utilizes the number of edges connecting data points from different classes to
examine the closeness between the distributions. The proposed test is exactly
distribution-free (the null distribution does not depend on the distribution of
the data) and can be efficiently applied to multivariate as well as
non-Euclidean data, whenever the inter-point distances are well-defined. We
show that the test is universally consistent, and prove a distributional limit
theorem for the test statistic under general alternatives. Through simulation
studies, we demonstrate its superior performance against other common and
well-known multisample tests. In scenarios where our test suggests
distributional differences across classes, we also propose an approach for
identifying which class or group contributes to this overall difference. The
method is applied to single cell transcriptomics data obtained from the
peripheral blood, cancer tissue, and tumor-adjacent normal tissue of human
subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer. Our
method unveils patterns in how biochemical metabolic pathways are altered
across immune cells in a cancer setting, depending on the tissue location. All
of the methods described herein are implemented in the R package multicross.

severe signal attenuation in the mm-wave frequency band. However,
susceptibility to beam mis-alignment due to mobility or blockage requires the
use of beam-alignment schemes, with huge cost in terms of overhead and use of
system resources. In this paper, a beam-alignment scheme is proposed based on
Bayesian multi-armed bandits, with the goal to maximize the alignment
probability and the data-communication throughput. A Bayesian approach is
proposed, by considering the state as a posterior distribution over angles of
arrival (AoA) and of departure (AoD), given the history of feedback signaling
and of beam pairs scanned by the base-station (BS) and the user-end (UE). A
simplified sufficient statistics for optimal control is derived, in the form of
preference of BS-UE beam pairs. By bounding a value function, the second-best
preference policy is derived, which strikes an optimal balance between
exploration and exploitation by selecting the beam pair with the current
second-best preference. Through Monte-Carlo simulation with analog beamforming,
the superior performance of the second-best preference policy is demonstrated
in comparison to existing schemes based on first-best preference, linear
Thompson sampling, and upper confidence bounds, with up to 7%, 10% and 30%
improvements in alignment probability, respectively.

vortices driven by strong dc currents in layered superconductors. Dynamic
equations for interlayer phase differences in a stack of coupled
superconducting layers were solved to calculate a drag coefficient $\eta(J)$ of
the vortex as a function of the perpendicular dc current density $J$. It is
shown that Cherenkov radiation produced by a moving vortex causes significant
radiation drag increasing $\eta(v)$ at high vortex velocities $v$ and striking
instabilities of driven Josephson vortices moving faster than a terminal
velocity $v_c$. The steady-state flux flow breaks down at $v>v_c$ as the vortex
starts producing a cascade of expanding vortex-antivortex pairs evolving into
either planar macrovortex structures or branching flux patterns propagating
both along and across the layers. The pair production triggered by a rapidly
moving vortex is most pronounced in a stack of underdamped planar junctions
where it can occur at $J>J_s$ well below the interlayer Josephson critical
current density. Both $v_c$ and $J_s$ were calculated as functions of the
quasiparticle damping parameter, and the dc magnetic field applied parallel to
the layers. The effects of vortex interaction on the Cherenkov instability of
moving vortex chains and lattices in annular stacks of Josephson junctions were
considered. It is shown that a vortex driven by a current density $J>J_s$ in a
multilayer of finite length excites self-sustained large-amplitude standing
waves of magnetic flux, resulting in temporal oscillations of the total
magnetic moment. We evaluated a contribution of this effect to the power $W$

exploit the multi-scale resolution of a wavelet filter bank to obtain an

to translations, and stable to perturbations that are close to translations.
This stability property dons the scattering transform with a robustness to
small changes in the metric domain of the data. When considering network data,
regular convolutions do not hold since the data domain presents an irregular
structure given by the network topology.
  In this work, we extend scattering transforms to network data by using
multiresolution graph wavelets, whose computation can be obtained by means of
graph convolutions. Furthermore, we prove that the resulting graph scattering
transforms are stable to metric perturbations of the underlying network. This
renders graph scattering transforms robust to changes on the network topology,

Milky Way (MW) disc by an $m=2$ bar, using test particle simulations and the
actions $(J_R,L_z,J_z)$ estimated in an axisymmetric potential. These make
three useful diagnostics cleanly visible. (1.) We use the well-known
characteristic flip from outward to inward motion at the Outer Lindblad
Resonance (OLR, $l=+1,m=2$), which occurs along the axisymmetric resonance line
(ARL) in $(L_z,J_R)$, to identify in the \emph{Gaia} action data three
candidates for the bar's OLR and pattern speed $\Omega_\text{bar}$:
$1.85\Omega_0$, $1.20\Omega_0$, and $1.63\Omega_0$ (with $\sim0.1\Omega_0$
systematic uncertainty). The \emph{Gaia} data is therefore consistent with both
slow and fast bar models in the literature, but disagrees with recent
measurements of $\sim1.45\Omega_0$. (2.) For the first time, we demonstrate
that bar resonances -- especially the OLR -- cause a gradient in vertical
action $\langle J_z \rangle$ with $L_z$ around the ARL via ""$J_z$-sorting"" of
stars. This could contribute to the observed coupling of $\langle v_R \rangle$
and $\langle | v_z | \rangle$ in the Galactic disc. (3.) We confirm prior
results that the behaviour of resonant orbits is well approximated by
scattering and oscillation in $(L_z,J_R)$ along a slope $\Delta J_R/\Delta L_z
= l/m$ centered on the $l$:$m$ ARL. Overall, we demonstrate that
axisymmetrically estimated actions are a powerful diagnostic tool even in
non-axisymmetric systems.

complicated frequency dependence in the presence of Faraday rotation, and are
best recovered through broad fractional-bandwidth polarization measurements at
frequencies $\lesssim 5$ GHz. A unique opportunity for measuring the foreground

scope of a Southern sky survey in S-Band at 1 degree angular resolution and
explore its added advantage for application of powerful techniques, such as,
Stokes $Q$, $U$ fitting and RM-synthesis. A full Southern-sky polarization
survey with this telescope, when combined with other on-going efforts at
slightly higher frequencies, will provide an excellent frequency coverage for
modeling and extrapolating the foreground polarized synchrotron emission to CMB
frequencies ($\gtrsim80$~GHz) with rms brightness temperature better than 10~nK

the effects of Faraday depolarization, especially in low Galactic latitude

modulation of the phase, manifested by unusual superflow patterns and
circulating currents, that also break time-reversal symmetry. We list the
general conditions needed for realization of phase crystals. Using microscopic
theory we then derive an analytic expression for the superfluid density tensor
for the case of a non-uniform environment in a semi-infinite superconductor. We
demonstrate how the surface quasiparticle states enter the superfluid density
and identify phase crystallization as the main player in several previous
numerical observations in unconventional superconductors, and predict existence
of a similar phenomenon in superconductor-ferromagnetic structures. This
analytic approach provides a new unifying aspect for the exploration of
boundary-induced quasiparticles and collective excitations in superconductors.
More generally, we trace the origin of phase crystallization to non-local
properties of the gradient energy, which implies existence of similar
pattern-forming instabilities in many other contexts.

simulated using non-deterministic Cellular Automata. The method to implement
this program is outlined and our results show a good approximation to the exact
analytic solution. The phase transition in $2d$ Ising model is studied with a
$40\times40$ hexagonal-lattice with five different boundary conditions (bcs)
i.e., adiabatic, periodic, reflexive, fixed $+1$ and fixed $-1$ with random
orientation of spins as initial conditions in the absence of an external
applied magnetic field. The critical temperature below which the spontaneous
magnetization appears as well as other physical quantities such as the
magnetization, energy, specific heat, susceptibility and entropy with each of
the bcs are calculated. The phase transition occurs around $T^H_c$ = 1.5 which
approximates well with the result obtained from exact analytic solution by
Wannier and Houtappel. We compare the behavior of magnetisation per cell for
five different types of bcs by calculating the number of points close to the
line of zero magnetization for $T>T^H_c$. We find that the periodic, adiabatic
and reflexive bcs give closer approximation to the value of $T^H_c$ than fixed
$+1$ and fixed $-1$ bcs with all three initial conditions for lattice size less
than $50\times50$. However, for lattice size between $50\times50$ and
$200\times200$, fixed $+1$ bc and fixed $-1$ bc give closer approximation to
the $T^H_c$ with initial conditions in which all spins are in down
configuration and all spins are in up configuration respectively.

point-like boundary constraints and certain interior constraints in open

Gromov-Witten invariants of homologically non-trivial Lagrangians with more
than one point-like boundary constraint. In this case, the open Gromov-Witten

behaviour in finance. Learning expert agents' reward functions through their
external demonstrations is hence particularly relevant for subsequent design of
realistic agent-based simulations. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims at
acquiring such reward functions through inference, allowing to generalize the
resulting policy to states not observed in the past. This paper investigates
whether IRL can infer such rewards from agents within real financial stochastic
environments: limit order books (LOB). We introduce a simple one-level LOB,
where the interactions of a number of stochastic agents and an expert trading
agent are modelled as a Markov decision process. We consider two cases for the
expert's reward: either a simple linear function of state features; or a
complex, more realistic non-linear function. Given the expert agent's
demonstrations, we attempt to discover their strategy by modelling their latent
reward function using linear and Gaussian process (GP) regressors from previous
literature, and our own approach through Bayesian neural networks (BNN). While
the three methods can learn the linear case, only the GP-based and our proposed
BNN methods are able to discover the non-linear reward case. Our BNN IRL
algorithm outperforms the other two approaches as the number of samples
increases. These results illustrate that complex behaviours, induced by
non-linear reward functions amid agent-based stochastic scenarios, can be
deduced through inference, encouraging the use of inverse reinforcement
learning for opponent-modelling in multi-agent systems.

having various Au/Pt length ratios, swimming near a wall in an imposed
background flow. We find that their ability to robustly orient and move
upstream, i.e. to rheotax, depends strongly on the Au/Pt ratio, which is easily
tunable in synthesis. Numerical simulations of swimming rods actuated by a
surface slip show a similar rheotactic tunability when varying the location of
the surface slip versus surface drag. Slip location determines whether swimmers
are Pushers (rear-actuated), Pullers (front-actuated), or in between. Our
simulations and modeling show that Pullers rheotax most robustly due to their
larger tilt angle to the wall, which makes them responsive to flow gradients.
Thus, rheotactic response infers the nature of difficult to measure flow-fields
of an active particle, establishes its dependence on swimmer type, and shows
how Janus rods can be tuned for flow responsiveness. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of a simple geometric sieve for rheotactic ability.

experimental and an accompanying numerical toolbox to create and analyze

coupled harmonic oscillator systems that are very easily constructed, offer a
variety of geometric configurations, and whose eigenfunctions and eigenvalues
are amenable to detailed analysis. These systems offer well defined analogs to
coupled oscillator systems in general in that they are characterized by
resonances whose frequency spectra depend on the individual resonators, the
interactions between them, and the geometric and topological symmetries and
boundary conditions. In particular, we describe an experimental analog of a
small one-dimensional system, with excellent agreement with theory. The
numerical part of the toolbox allows for simulations of larger mesoscopic
systems with a semi-continuous band structure, in which all resonators still
exhibit individual signatures. Systematic parameter variation yields an
astonishing richness of band structures in this simple linear system, allowing
for further explorations into novel phenomena of topological modes.

to planets. This connection has been difficult to show unequivocally, as other
processes may also produce these features. Particularly, a photoelectric
instability (PEI) has been proposed, operating in gas-rich optically thin
disks, that generates structures predicted by planet--disk interactions. We
examine the question of how to disentangle planetary effects on disk structure
from the effects of the PEI. We use the Pencil Code to perform 2D global
hydrodynamical models of the dynamics of gas and dust in a thin disk, with and
without planetary perturbers. Photoelectric heating is modeled with an equation
of state where pressure is proportional to dust surface density. The drag force
on grains and its backreaction on the gas are included. Analyzing the situation
without PEI, we find that gas--dust interactions alter the shape of the
planetary gap from the dust-free case when the local dust-to-gas ratio
$\varepsilon$ approaches unity. This result applies also to primordial disks,
because dust drifting inwards accumulates at the edge of the planetary gap, and
any initial dust-to-gas ratio eventually achieves $\varepsilon=1$ if the dust
reservoir is sufficient. We find a result particular to high dust-to-gas ratio
disks as well: as dust drifts inwards, the dust front becomes a sharp
transition, and the backreaction triggers the Rossby wave instability. When PEI
is included, we find that it obscures structures induced by planets unless the
planet's mass is sufficiently large to carve a noticeable gap. Specifically,
the instability generates arcs and rings of regular spacing: a planet is
discernible when it carves a dust gap wider than the wavelength of the PEI.

with existing optimization methods, such as SGD and momentum SGD, for training
acceleration. Theoretical results show that the learning accuracy of ADASS is
comparable to that of counterparts with full training set. Furthermore,
empirical results on both shallow models and deep models also show that ADASS
can accelerate the training process of existing methods without sacrificing

enforcing noninterference. To address the practical need of selective and
flexible declassification of confidential information, several approaches have
developed a notion of relaxed noninterference, where security labels are either
functions or types. The labels-as-types approach to relaxed noninterference
supports expressive declassification policies, including recursive ones, via a
simple subtyping-based ordering, and provides a local, modular reasoning
principle. In this work, we extend this expressive declassification approach in
order to support polymorphic declassification. First, we identify the need for
bounded polymorphism through concrete examples. We then formalize polymorphic
relaxed noninterference in a typed object-oriented calculus, using a
step-indexed logical relation to prove that all well-typed terms are secure.
Finally, we address the case of primitive types, which requires a form of
ad-hoc polymorphism. Therefore, this work addresses practical hurdles to
providing controlled and expressive declassification for the construction of
information-flow secure systems.

compute optimal journeys in either a pure public transit network or a pure
transfer graph, combining the two increases running times significantly.
Existing approaches therefore typically only support limited walking between

transfer graph to be transitively closed. To overcome these shortcomings, we
propose a novel preprocessing technique called ULTRA (UnLimited TRAnsfers):
Given an unlimited transfer graph, which may represent any non-schedule-based

are provably sufficient for computing a Pareto set of optimal journeys. These
transfer shortcuts can be integrated into a variety of state-of-the-art public
transit algorithms, establishing the ULTRA-Query algorithm family. Our
extensive experimental evaluation shows that ULTRA improves these algorithms
from limited to unlimited transfers without sacrificing query speed. This is
true not just for walking, but also for faster transfer modes such as bicycle
or car. Compared to the state of the art for multimodal journey planning, the
fastest ULTRA-based algorithm achieves a speedup of an order of magnitude.

While recent progress has been made for this problem, most of the existing
methods ignore the compositionality in visual concept representation (e.g.
objects are built from parts or composed of semantic attributes), which is key
to the human ability to easily learn from a small number of examples. To
enhance the few-shot learning models with compositionality, in this paper we
present the simple yet powerful Compositional Feature Aggregation (CFA) module
as a weakly-supervised regularization for deep networks. Given the deep feature
maps extracted from the input, our CFA module first disentangles the feature
space into disjoint semantic subspaces that model different attributes, and
then bilinearly aggregates the local features within each of these subspaces.
CFA explicitly regularizes the representation with both semantic and spatial
compositionality to produce discriminative representations for few-shot
recognition tasks. Moreover, our method does not need any supervision for
attributes and object parts during training, thus can be conveniently plugged
into existing models for end-to-end optimization while keeping the model size
and computation cost nearly the same. Extensive experiments on few-shot image
classification and action recognition tasks demonstrate that our method
provides substantial improvements over recent state-of-the-art methods.

states following the classical pattern widely seen in other systems. We focus
the analysis on the He I emission lines at 5876 and 6678 Angs, as well as on
Halpha. We detect clear accretion disk wind features (P-Cyg profiles and broad
emission line wings) in the hard state, both during outburst rise and decay.
These are not witnessed during the several months long soft state. However, our
data suggest that the visibility of the outflow might be significantly affected
by the ionisation state of the accretion disk. The terminal velocity of the
wind is above ~ 1200 km/s, which is similar to outflow velocities derived from
(hard-state) optical winds and (soft-state) X-ray winds in other systems. The
wind signatures, in particular the P-Cyg profiles, are very shallow, and their
detection has only been possible thanks to a combination of source brightness
and intense monitoring at very high signal-to-noise. This study indicates that
cold, optical winds are most likely a common feature of black hole accretion,
and therefore, that wind-like outflows are a general mechanism of mass and
angular momentum removal operating throughout the entire X-ray binary outburst.

photometric error between images. Prior work on exploiting edge pixels instead
treats edges as features and employ various techniques to match edge lines or
pixels, which adds unnecessary complexity. Direct methods typically operate on
all pixel intensities, which proves to be highly redundant. In contrast our
method builds on direct visual odometry methods naturally with minimal added
computation. It is not only more efficient than direct dense methods since we
iterate with a fraction of the pixels, but also more accurate. We achieve high
accuracy and efficiency by extracting edges from only one image, and utilize
robust Gauss-Newton to minimize the photometric error of these edge pixels.
This simultaneously finds the edge pixels in the reference image, as well as
the relative camera pose that minimizes the photometric error. We test various
edge detectors, including learned edges, and determine that the optimal edge
detector for this method is the Canny edge detection algorithm using automatic
thresholding. We highlight key differences between our edge direct method and
direct dense methods, in particular how higher levels of image pyramids can
lead to significant aliasing effects and result in incorrect solution
convergence. We show experimentally that reducing the photometric error of edge
pixels also reduces the photometric error of all pixels, and we show through an
ablation study the increase in accuracy obtained by optimizing edge pixels
only. We evaluate our method on the RGB-D TUM benchmark on which we achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

that $\textit{ortho}$-hydrogen can be used as a probe that is sensitive to the

matrix method that includes the molecular hyperfine degrees of freedom and

provide an opportunity to directly observe Hawking radiation. Because the

applicable to a variety of unstructured and structured problems arising in,
e.g., scheduling, production planning, and graph optimization. As IP models
many provably hard to solve problems, modern IP solvers rely on many
heuristics. These heuristics are usually human-designed, and naturally prone to
suboptimality. The goal of this work is to show that the performance of those
solvers can be greatly enhanced using reinforcement learning (RL). In
particular, we investigate a specific methodology for solving IPs, known as the
Cutting Plane Method. This method is employed as a subroutine by all modern IP
solvers. We present a deep RL formulation, network architecture, and algorithms
for intelligent adaptive selection of cutting planes (aka cuts). Across a wide
range of IP tasks, we show that the trained RL agent significantly outperforms
human-designed heuristics, and effectively generalizes to 10X larger instances
and across IP problem classes. The trained agent is also demonstrated to
benefit the popular downstream application of cutting plane methods in
Branch-and-Cut algorithm, which is the backbone of state-of-the-art commercial
IP solvers.

we adopt a statistical perspective on local graph clustering, and we analyze
the performance of the l1-regularized PageRank method~(Fountoulakis et. al.)
for the recovery of a single target cluster, given a seed node inside the
cluster. Assuming the target cluster has been generated by a random model, we
present two results. In the first, we show that the optimal support of
l1-regularized PageRank recovers the full target cluster, with bounded false
positives. In the second, we show that if the seed node is connected solely to
the target cluster then the optimal support of l1-regularized PageRank recovers
exactly the target cluster. We also show empirically that l1-regularized
PageRank has a state-of-the-art performance on many real graphs, demonstrating
the superiority of the method. From a computational perspective, we show that
the solution path of l1-regularized PageRank is monotonic. This allows for the
application of the forward stagewise algorithm, which approximates the solution
path in running time that does not depend on the size of the whole graph.
Finally, we show that l1-regularized PageRank and approximate personalized
PageRank (APPR), another very popular method for local graph clustering, are
equivalent in the sense that we can lower and upper bound the output of one
with the output of the other. Based on this relation, we establish for APPR
similar results to those we establish for l1-regularized PageRank.

reconnection layers are unstable to the plasmoid instability, leading to a

remains questionable for many applications. First, the reconnection electric
field is often well above the runaway limit, implying that collisional
resistivity is invalid. Furthermore, both theory and simulations suggest that
plasmoid formation may rapidly induce a transition to kinetic scales, due to
the formation of thin current sheets. Here, this problem is studied for the
first time using a first-principles kinetic simulation with a Fokker-Planck
collision operator in 3D. The low-$\beta$ reconnecting current layer thins
rapidly due to Joule heating before onset of the oblique plasmoid instability.
Linear growth rates for standard ($k_y = 0$) tearing modes agree with
semi-collisional boundary layer theory, but the angular spectrum of oblique
($|k_y|>0$) modes is significantly narrower than predicted. In the non-linear
regime, flux-ropes formed by the instability undergo complex interactions as
they are advected and rotated by the reconnection outflow jets, leading to a
turbulent state with stochastic magnetic field. In a manner similar to previous
2D results, super-Dreicer fields induce a transition to kinetic reconnection in
thin current layers that form between flux-ropes. These results may be testable
within new laboratory experiments.

visual scene --- requires substantial training data. However, most predicates
only occur a handful of times making them difficult to learn. We introduce the
first scene graph prediction model that supports few-shot learning of
predicates. Existing scene graph generation models represent objects using
pretrained object detectors or word embeddings that capture semantic object
information at the cost of encoding information about which relationships they
afford. So, these object representations are unable to generalize to new
few-shot relationships. We introduce a framework that induces object
representations that are structured according to their visual relationships.
Unlike past methods, our framework embeds objects that afford similar
relationships closer together. This property allows our model to perform well
in the few-shot setting. For example, applying the 'riding' predicate
transformation to 'person' modifies the representation towards objects like
'skateboard' and 'horse' that enable riding. We generate object representations
by learning predicates trained as message passing functions within a new graph
convolution framework. The object representations are used to build few-shot
predicate classifiers for rare predicates with as few as 1 labeled example. We

Of the 50 G0-M3 Upper Sco members with disks in our sample, only seven host a

members without disks. This matches a trend seen in the 1-2 Myr old Taurus
region, where systems with a stellar companion within 40 au have a lower
fraction of infrared-identified disks than those without such companions,
indicating shorter disk lifetimes in close multiple systems. However, the
fractions of disk systems with a stellar companion within 40 au match in Upper
Sco and Taurus. Additionally, we see no difference in the millimeter
brightnesses of disks in Upper Sco systems with and without companions, in
contrast to Taurus where systems with a companion within 300 au are
significantly fainter than wider and single systems. These results suggest that
the effects of stellar companions on disk lifetimes occur within the first 1-2
Myr of disk evolution, after which companions play little further role. By
contrast, disks around single stars lose the millimeter-sized dust grains in
their outer regions between ages of 1-2 Myr and 5-11 Myr. The end result of
small dust disk sizes and faint millimeter luminosities is the same whether the
disk has been truncated by a companion or has evolved through internal

highly correlated with experimental results on the full dataset. We generate
these proxy datasets using by randomly sampling from examples or classes,
training on only the easiest or hardest examples and training on synthetic
examples generated by ""data distillation"". We compare these techniques to the
more widely used baseline of training on the full dataset for fewer epochs. For
each proxying strategy, we estimate three measures of ""proxy quality"": how much
of the variance in experimental results on the full dataset can be explained by
experimental results on the proxy dataset.
  Experiments on Imagenette and Imagewoof (Howard, 2019) show that running
hyperparameter search on the easiest 10% of examples explains 81% of the
variance in experiment results on the target task, and using the easiest 50% of
examples can explain 95% of the variance, significantly more than training on

proxies are higher quality than training on the full dataset for a reduced

those with an equivalent number of examples spread across all classes.

this work, we employ SRV coordinates as a feature set for Markov state model

from SRV coordinates are more robust to the choice of input features, exhibit
faster implied timescale convergence, and permit the use of shorter lagtimes to
construct higher kinetic resolution models. We apply this methodology to study
the folding kinetics and conformational landscape of the Trp-cage miniprotein.
Folding and unfolding mean first passage times are in good agreement with prior
literature, and a nine macrostate model is presented. The unfolded ensemble
comprises a central kinetic hub with interconversions to several metastable
unfolded conformations and which serves as the gateway to the folded ensemble.
The folded ensemble comprises the native state, a partially unfolded
intermediate ""loop"" state, and a previously unreported short-lived intermediate
that we were able to resolve due to the high time-resolution of the SRV-MSM. We
propose SRVs as an excellent candidate for integration into modern MSM

mappings to reduce the dimensionality of neurons and minimizes their
hyperspherical energy. According to different designs for the projection

useful in many applications ranging from robustness certification of

Lipschitz constant suffer from either lack of accuracy or poor scalability. In
this paper, we present a convex optimization framework to compute guaranteed
upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant of DNNs both accurately and efficiently.
Our main idea is to interpret activation functions as gradients of convex
potential functions. Hence, they satisfy certain properties that can be
described by quadratic constraints. This particular description allows us to
pose the Lipschitz constant estimation problem as a semidefinite program (SDP).
The resulting SDP can be adapted to increase either the estimation accuracy (by
capturing the interaction between activation functions of different layers) or
scalability (by decomposition and parallel implementation). We illustrate the
utility of our approach with a variety of experiments on randomly generated
networks and on classifiers trained on the MNIST and Iris datasets. In
particular, we experimentally demonstrate that our Lipschitz bounds are the
most accurate compared to those in the literature. We also study the impact of
adversarial training methods on the Lipschitz bounds of the resulting
classifiers and show that our bounds can be used to efficiently provide

  We suggest the first coresets that approximate the negative log-likelihood
for $k$-Gaussians Mixture Models (GMM) of arbitrary shapes (ratio between
eigenvalues of their covariance matrices). For example, for any input set $D$
whose coordinates are integers in $[-n^{100},n^{100}]$ and any fixed $k,d\geq
1$, the coreset size is $(\log n)^{O(1)}/\varepsilon^2$, and can be computed in
time near-linear in $n$, with high probability. The optimal GMM may then be
approximated quickly by learning the small coreset.
  Previous results [NIPS'11, JMLR'18] suggested such small coresets for the
case of semi-speherical unit Gaussians, i.e., where their corresponding
eigenvalues are constants between $\frac{1}{2\pi}$ to $2\pi$.
  Our main technique is a reduction between coresets for $k$-GMMs and

elements in a matroid and vertices in a graph. A set of agents is feasible if
they form both an independent set in the matroid and an independent set in the
graph. Our main result is an ex-ante 1/(2d+2)-prophet inequality, where d is a
graph parameter upper-bounded by the maximum size of an independent set in the
neighborhood of any vertex.
  We establish this result through a framework that sets both dynamic prices
for elements in the matroid (using the method of balanced thresholds), and
static but discriminatory prices for vertices in the graph (motivated by recent
developments in approximate dynamic programming). The threshold for accepting
an agent is then the sum of these two prices.
  We show that for graphs induced by a certain family of interval-scheduling
constraints, the value of d is 1. Our framework thus provides the first
constant-factor prophet inequality when there are both matroid-independence
constraints and interval-scheduling constraints. It also unifies and improves
several results from the literature, leading to a 1/2-prophet inequality when
agents have XOS valuation functions over a set of items and use them for a

conventional Bell tests, all relevant measurements need only distinguish
between two macroscopically distinct states of the system being measured. Here,
measurements give macroscopically distinguishable outcomes for a system
observable and do not resolve microscopic properties (of order $\hbar$).
Macroscopic local realism assumes: (1) macroscopic realism (the system prior to
measurement is in a state which will lead to just one of the macroscopically
distinguishable outcomes) and (2) macroscopic locality (a measurement on a
system at one location cannot affect the macroscopic outcome of the measurement
on a system at another location, if the measurement events are spacelike
separated). To obtain a quantifiable test, we define $M$-scopic local realism
where the outcomes are separated by an amount $\sim M$. We first show for $N$
up to $20$ that $N$-scopic Bell violations are predicted for entangled
superpositions of $N$ bosons (at each of two sites). Secondly, we show
violation of $M$-scopic local realism for entangled superpositions of coherent
states of amplitude $\alpha$, for arbitrarily large $M=\alpha$. In both cases,
the systems evolve dynamically according to a local nonlinear interaction. The
first uses nonlinear beam splitters realised through nonlinear Josephson
interactions; the second is based on nonlinear Kerr interactions. To achieve
the Bell violations, the traditional choice between two spin measurement
settings is replaced by a choice between different times of evolution at each
site.

computational linguistics. Until now, the most popular automatic metric to
measure the quality of SMT is BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score.
Lately, SMT along with the BLEU metric has been applied to a Software
Engineering task named code migration. (In)Validating the use of BLEU score
could advance the research and development of SMT-based code migration tools.
Unfortunately, there is no study to approve or disapprove the use of BLEU score
for source code. In this paper, we conducted an empirical study on BLEU score
to (in)validate its suitability for the code migration task due to its
inability to reflect the semantics of source code. In our work, we use human
judgment as the ground truth to measure the semantic correctness of the
migrated code. Our empirical study demonstrates that BLEU does not reflect
translation quality due to its weak correlation with the semantic correctness
of translated code. We provided counter-examples to show that BLEU is
ineffective in comparing the translation quality between SMT-based models. Due
to BLEU's ineffectiveness for code migration task, we propose an alternative
metric RUBY, which considers lexical, syntactical, and semantic representations
of source code. We verified that RUBY achieves a higher correlation coefficient
with the semantic correctness of migrated code, 0.775 in comparison with 0.583
of BLEU score. We also confirmed the effectiveness of RUBY in reflecting the
changes in translation quality of SMT-based translation models. With its
advantages, RUBY can be used to evaluate SMT-based code migration models.

search over the space of possible translations of the pseudocode to find a

to localize the sources of program failures, it is difficult to guide search
toward more promising programs. We propose to perform credit assignment based
on signals from compilation errors, which constitute 88.7% of program failures.
Concretely, we treat the translation of each pseudocode line as a discrete
portion of the program, and whenever a synthesized program fails to compile, an
error localization method tries to identify the portion of the program
responsible for the failure. We then focus search over alternative translations
of the pseudocode for those portions. For evaluation, we collected the SPoC
dataset (Search-based Pseudocode to Code) containing 18,356 programs with
human-authored pseudocode and test cases. Under a budget of 100 program

frameworks such as Android is notoriously difficult. To create apps that behave
as expected, developers must follow complex and often implicit asynchronous
programming protocols. Such protocols intertwine the proper registering of
callbacks to receive control from the framework with appropriate
application-programming interface (API) calls that in turn affect the set of
possible future callbacks. An app violates the protocol when, for example, it
calls a particular API method in a state of the framework where such a call is
invalid. What makes automated reasoning hard in this domain is largely what
makes programming apps against such frameworks hard: the specification of the
protocol is unclear, and the control flow is complex, asynchronous, and
higher-order. In this paper, we tackle the problem of specifying and modeling
event-driven application-programming protocols. In particular, we formalize a
core meta-model that captures the dialogue between event-driven frameworks and
application callbacks. Based on this meta-model, we define a language called
lifestate that permits precise and formal descriptions of
application-programming protocols and the callback control flow imposed by the
event-driven framework. Lifestate unifies modeling what app callbacks can
expect of the framework with specifying rules the app must respect when calling
into the framework. In this way, we effectively combine lifecycle constraints
and typestate rules. To evaluate the effectiveness of lifestate modeling, we
provide a dynamic verification algorithm that takes as input a trace of
execution of an app and a lifestate protocol specification to either produce a
trace witnessing a protocol violation or a proof that no such trace is
realizable.

for multi-class classification. It can be applied to any classifier that
outputs confidence estimates and is not limited to neural networks. We also
provide a theoretical analysis regarding the over- and underconfidence of a

important for designing robot-assisted teleoperation interfaces that are easy
and natural for human operators to use. In this paper, we aim to develop a
data-driven approach to numerically characterize the operative difficulty
demand of complex teleoperation. In effort to provide an entirely
task-independent assessment, we consider using only data collected from the
human user including: (1) physiological response, and (2) movement kinematics.
By leveraging an unsupervised domain adaptation technique, our approach learns
the user information that defines task difficulty in a well-known source,
namely, a Fitt's target reaching task, and generalizes that knowledge to a more
complex human motor control scenario, namely, the teleoperation of a robotic
system. Our approach consists of two main parts: (1) The first part accounts
for the inherent variances of user physiological and kinematic response between
these cross-domain motor control scenarios that are vastly different. (2) A
stacked two-layer learner is designed to improve the overall modeling
performance, yielding a 96.6% accuracy in predicting the known difficulty of a
Fitts' reaching task when using movement kinematic features. We then validate
the effectiveness of our model by investigating teleoperated robotic needle
steering as a case study. Compared with a standard NASA TLX user survey, our
results indicate significant differences in the difficulty demand for various
choices of needle steering control algorithms, p<0.05, as well as the
difficulty of steering the needle to different targets, p<0.05. The results
highlight the potential of our approach to be used as a design tool to create
more intuitive and natural teleoperation interfaces in robot-assisted systems.

of this analogy at the critical point due to shear rigidity. We then consider
the phase transition at fixed volume, a relatively unexplored paradigm for
polymer gels that results in a phase-separated equilibrium consisting of
coexisting solvent-rich and solvent-poor regions of gel. Again, the gel's shear
rigidity is found to have a profound effect on the phase transition, here
resulting in macroscopic shape change at constant volume of the sample,
exemplified by the tunable buckling of toroidal samples of polymer gel. By
drawing analogies with extreme mechanics, where large shape changes are
achieved via mechanical instabilities, we formulate the notion of extreme

conventional PN analyzer. The main virtues of our method are: (i) the noise
specs of the PN analyzer are relaxed by a factor equal to the carrier
suppression ratio; and, (ii) the capability to measure the AN using a PN
analyzer, with no need for the analyzer to feature AN measurement. An obvious
variant enables AN and PN measurements using an AN analyzer with no PN
measurement capability. Such instrument is extremely simple and easy to
implement with a power-detector diode followed by a FFT analyzer. Unlike the
classical bridge (interferometric) method, there is no need for external line
stretcher and variable attenuators because phase and amplitude control is
implemented in the device under test. In one case (AD9144), we could measure
the noise over 10 decades of frequency. The flicker noise matches the exact
$1/f$ law with a maximum discrepancy of $\pm1$ dB over 7.5 decades. Thanks to
simplicity, reliability, and low background noise, this method has the
potential to become the standard method for the AN and PN measurement of DACs
and DDSs.

including adaptive estimation of uncertain parameters and friction force is
designed for the leg dynamics, to minimize the deviation of the joint position
and its reference value. At the lower layer, a Lyapunov-based neural network
adaptive controller is in charge of computing control action for the hydraulic

compensate for model uncertainty, nonlinearity, and control saturation. The
proposed approach shows to be capable in minimizing the interaction torque

food item in a given direction contributes towards the total smell of food in
that direction, however the smell of any individual food item decays with its
distance from the forager. We assume a power-law decay of the smell with the
distance of the food from the forager and vary the exponent $\alpha$ governing
this decay. We find, both analytically and through simulations, that for a
forager living in one dimension, there is a critical value of $\alpha$, namely
$\alpha_c$, where for $\alpha<\alpha_c$ the forager will die in finite time,
however for $\alpha>\alpha_c$ the forager has a nonzero probability to live
infinite time. We calculate analytically, the critical value, $\alpha_c$,
separating these two behaviors and find that $\alpha_c$ depends on $S$ as
$\alpha_c=1 + 1/\lceil S/2 \rceil$. We determine analytically that at
$\alpha=\alpha_c$ the system has an essential singularity. We also study, using
simulations, a forager with long-range decaying smell in two dimensions (2D)

However, in 2D we observe indications of an optimal $\alpha$ for which the

novel model named Convolutional Deformable Part Models (CDPM). CDPM works by
decoupling the complex part alignment procedure into two easier steps: first, a
vertical alignment step detects each body part in the vertical direction, with
the help of a multi-task learning model; second, a horizontal refinement step
based on attention suppresses the background information around each detected
body part. Since these two steps are performed orthogonally and sequentially,
the difficulty of part alignment is significantly reduced. In the testing
stage, CDPM is able to accurately align flexible body parts without any need
for outside information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed CDPM for part alignment. Most impressively, CDPM
achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale datasets:

that AGNES produces results that are most similar to the expectations of a

linkage. Among the linkage prescriptions we tested, Ward's method performs
best, and average linkage obtains comparable results only if outliers are

Strong interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange coupling plays a critical role for
the high DW velocity since it inhibits the tilting of DW plane with strong
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. On the other hand, the Walker breakdown of
DW motion is also inhibited due to the stabilization of moment orientation

different phases for the scalar field, like the superfluid approach of
Berezhiani/Khoury. In low acceleration regimes of static gravitational fields
(in the Einstein frame) with accordingly low values of the scalar field
gradient, the scalar field Lagrangian combines a cubic kinetic term similar to
the ``a-quadratic'' Lagrangian used in the first covariant generalization of
MOND (RAQUAL) (Bekenstein/Milgrom:1984) and a second order derivative term
introduced by Novello et al. in the context of a Weyl geometric approach to
cosmology (Novello/Oliveira_et al:1993, Oliveira/Salim/Sautu:1997). In varying
with regard to $\phi$ the latter is variationally equivalent to a first order
expression. The scalar field equation thus remains of order two. In the
Einstein frame it assumes the form of a covariant generalization of the Milgrom
equation known from the classical MOND approach. It implies a corresponding
``non-metrical'' contribution to the acceleration of free fall trajectories.
The second order derivative term of the Lagrangian leads to a non-negligible
contribution to the energy momentum tensor and an {\em add-on to the light
deflection potential} in beautiful agreement with the dynamics of low velocity
trajectories. -- In higher sectional curvature regions, respectively for higher
accelerations in static fields, the scalar field Lagrangian consists of a
Jordan-Brans-Dicke term with sufficiently high value of the JBD-constant to
satisfy empirical constraints. Here the dynamics agrees effectively with the
one of Einstein gravity.

variability in the high-energy ($100\,$MeV$<E<100\,$GeV) $\gamma$-ray band,
which is continuously monitored with Fermi-LAT. During two periods of high
activity in April 2014 and June 2015 Target-of-Opportunity observations were
undertaken with H.E.S.S. in the very-high-energy (VHE, $E>100\,$GeV)
$\gamma$-ray domain. While the observation in 2014 provides an upper limit, the
observation in 2015 results in a signal with $8.7\,\sigma$ significance above
an energy threshold of $66\,$GeV. No VHE variability has been detected during
the 2015 observations. The VHE photon spectrum is soft and described by a
power-law index of $4.2\pm 0.3$. The H.E.S.S. data along with a detailed and
contemporaneous multiwavelength data set provide constraints on the physical
parameters of the emission region. The minimum distance of the emission region
from the central black hole is estimated using two plausible geometries of the
broad-line region and three potential intrinsic spectra. The emission region is
confidently placed at $r\gtrsim 1.7\times10^{17}\,$cm from the black hole,
i.e., beyond the assumed distance of the broad-line region. Time-dependent
leptonic and lepto-hadronic one-zone models are used to describe the evolution
of the 2015 flare. Neither model can fully reproduce the observations, despite
testing various parameter sets. Furthermore, the H.E.S.S. data are used to
derive constraints on Lorentz invariance violation given the large redshift of
3C 279.

network forensics for detecting an offender after the occurrence of a

transferred in the network means that the data stored by a PAS must be as

using Bloom filters have been proposed in the literature. The false positive
rate of existing techniques for detecting cybercriminals is unacceptably high,
i.e., many source and destination pairs are falsely determined as malicious,

of a hypergraph $H$, denoted by $\overline{\xi}(H)$, is the smallest integer
$t$ for which there exists a $t$-dimensional orthogonal representation of $H$.
In this paper we study computational aspects of the orthogonality dimension of
graphs and hypergraphs. We prove that for every $k \geq 4$, it is
$\mathsf{NP}$-hard (resp. quasi-$\mathsf{NP}$-hard) to distinguish $n$-vertex
$k$-uniform hypergraphs $H$ with $\overline{\xi}(H) \leq 2$ from those

assurance processes, the usage of tools, metrics, and patterns, as well as
participants' reflections on the topic. In 17 semi-structured interviews, we
discussed 14 different Microservice-based systems with software professionals
from 10 companies and how the sustainable evolution of these systems was
ensured. Interview transcripts were analyzed with a detailed coding system and
the constant comparison method.
  We found that especially systems for external customers relied on central
governance for the assurance. Participants saw guidelines like architectural
principles as important to ensure a base consistency for evolvability.
Interviewees also valued manual activities like code review or boy scouting,
even though automation and tool support was described as very important. Source
code quality was the primary target for the usage of tools and metrics. Despite
most reported issues being related to Architectural Technical Debt (ATD), our
participants did not apply any architectural or service-oriented tools and
metrics. While participants generally saw their Microservices as evolvable,
service cutting and finding an appropriate service granularity with low
coupling and high cohesion were reported as challenging. Future Microservices
research in the areas of evolution and technical debt should take these
findings and industry sentiments into account.

communication infrastructure in future smart cities. Hot spots easily appear in
road intersections, where effective communication among vehicles is
challenging. UAVs may serve as relays with the advantages of low price, easy
deployment, line-of-sight links, and flexible mobility. In this paper, we study
a UAV-assisted vehicular network where the UAV jointly adjusts its transmission
control (power and channel) and 3D flight to maximize the total throughput.
First, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) problem by modeling the
mobility of the UAV/vehicles and the state transitions. Secondly, we solve the
target problem using a deep reinforcement learning method, namely, the deep
deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and propose three solutions with
different control objectives. Deep reinforcement learning methods obtain the
optimal policy through the interactions with the environment without knowing
the environment variables. Considering that environment variables in our
problem are unknown and unmeasurable, we choose a deep reinforcement learning
method to solve it. Moreover, considering the energy consumption of 3D flight,
we extend the proposed solutions to maximize the total throughput per unit
energy. To encourage or discourage the UAV's mobility according to its
prediction, the DDPG framework is modified, where the UAV adjusts its learning
rate automatically. Thirdly, in a simplified model with small state space and
action space, we verify the optimality of proposed algorithms. Comparing with
two baseline schemes, we demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithms

geometric optics in a Lorentzian metric. The airplane boarding problem is
naturally embedded in a 1+1 dimensional space-time with a flat Lorentzian
metric. The duration of the boarding process can be calculated based on a
representation of the one-dimensional queue of passengers attempting to reach
their seats, into a two-dimensional space-time diagram. The ability of a
passenger to delay other passengers depends on their queue positions and row
designations. This is equivalent to the causal relationship between two events
in space-time, whereas two passengers are time-like separated if one is
blocking the other, and space-like if both can be seated simultaneously.
Geodesics in this geometry can be utilized to compute the asymptotic boarding
time, since space-time geometry is the many-particle (passengers) limit of
airplane boarding.
  Our approach naturally leads to a novel definition of an effective refractive
index. The introduction of an effective refractive index enables, for the first
time, an analytical calculation of the average boarding time for groups of
passengers with different aisle-clearing time distribution. In the past,
airline companies attempted to shorten the boarding times by trying boarding
policies that either allow slow or fast passengers to board first. Our
analytical calculations, backed by discrete-event simulations, support the
counter-intuitive result that the total boarding time is shorter with the slow
passengers boarding before the fast passengers. This is a universal result,
valid for any combination of the parameters that characterize the problem ---
percentage of slow passengers, ratio between aisle-clearing times between the
fast and the slow groups, and the density of passengers along the aisle. We
find an improvement of up to 28% compared with the Fast-First boarding policy.

This issue has badly impacted the quality and diversity of recommendations. To
solve this problem, look-alike algorithm is a good choice to extend audience
for high quality long-tail contents. But the traditional look-alike models
which widely used in online advertising are not suitable for recommender
systems because of the strict requirement of both real-time and effectiveness.
This paper introduces a real-time attention based look-alike model (RALM) for
recommender systems, which tackles the challenge of conflict between real-time

benefiting from seeds-to-user similarity prediction and improves the
effectiveness through optimizing user representation learning and look-alike

layer, which significantly improves the expressive ability of multi-fields
feature learning. On the other hand, considering the various members of seeds,
we design global attention unit and local attention unit to learn robust and
adaptive seeds representation with respect to a certain target user. At last,
we introduce seeds clustering mechanism which not only reduces the time
complexity of attention units prediction but also minimizes the loss of seeds

data are generated by widely distributed sensors, which reflects local
information. Upon them, unmanned aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs) are
deployed as moving MEC servers, which collect data and conduct initial steps of
data processing. On top of them, a center cloud receives processed results and
conducts further evaluation. As this is an online data processing system, the
edge nodes should stabilize delay to ensure data freshness. Furthermore,
limited onboard energy poses constraints to edge processing capability. To
smartly manage network resources for saving energy and stabilizing delay, we
develop an online determination policy based on Lyapunov Optimization. In cases
of low data rate, it tends to reduce edge processor frequency for saving
energy. In the presence of high data rate, it will smartly allocate bandwidth
for edge data offloading. Meanwhile, hovering UAV-BSs bring a large and

leveraged to provide enhanced generalization and fast task inference through

trying to explain their empirical success. Nonetheless, there is still a gap
between current theoretical results and empirical observations, even in the
case of shallow (one hidden-layer) networks. For example, in the task of
memorizing a random sample of size $m$ and dimension $d$, the best theoretical
result requires the size of the network to be $\tilde{\Omega}(\frac{m^2}{d})$,
while empirically a network of size slightly larger than $\frac{m}{d}$ is
sufficient. To bridge this gap, we turn to study a simplified model for ReLU
networks. We observe that a ReLU neuron is a product of a linear function with
a gate (the latter determines whether the neuron is active or not), where both
share a jointly trained weight vector. In this spirit, we introduce the Gated
Linear Unit (GaLU), which simply decouples the linearity from the gating by
assigning different vectors for each role. We show that GaLU networks allow us
to get optimization and generalization results that are much stronger than
those available for ReLU networks. Specifically, we show a memorization result
for networks of size $\tilde{\Omega}(\frac{m}{d})$, and improved generalization
bounds. Finally, we show that in some scenarios, GaLU networks behave similarly
to ReLU networks, hence proving to be a good choice of a simplified model.

useful approach to uniquely define the normal direction of boundary elements.
However, matrix equations constructed by conventional boundary integral

boundary conditions. In this paper, we analyze the singular conditions of the
CBIE formulation for cases where the boundary conditions at the double node are
imposed by combinations of Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and interface conditions.
To address this singularity we propose the use of hypersingular integral
equations (HBIE) for wave propagation problems that obey Helmholtz equation. To
demonstrate the applicability of HBIE, we compare three types of simultaneous
equations: (i) CBIE, (ii) partial-HBIE in which HBIE is only applied to the
double nodes at corners while CBIE is applied to the other nodes, and (iii)
full-HBIE in which HBIE is applied to all nodes. Based on our numerical
results, we observe the following results. The singularity of the matrix
equations for problems with any combination of boundary conditions can be
resolved by both full-HBIE and partial-HBIE, and partial-HBIE exhibits better
accuracy than full-HBIE. Furthermore, the computational cost of partial-HBIE is
smaller than that of full-HBIE.

depends on the collision velocity and the model parameter. For the first type
of events, four distinct scattering channels are found: \textit{kink

of one half of each kink and the subsequent recombination of the other two

collide and decay to the vacuum configuration). For the second type of events,

location, for example by changing the binding affinity of a substrate at the
active site. The induced fit and population shift models, which differ by the
assumed number of stable configurations, explain such cooperative binding from
a thermodynamic viewpoint. Yet, understanding what mechanical principles
constrain these models remains a challenge. Here we provide an empirical study
on 34 proteins supporting the idea that allosteric conformational change
generally occurs along a soft elastic mode presenting extended regions of high
shear. We argue, based on a detailed analysis of how the energy profile along
such a mode depends on binding, that in the induced fit scenario there is an
optimal stiffness $k_a^*\sim 1/N$ for cooperative binding, where $N$ is the
number of residues involved in the allosteric response. We find that the
population shift scenario is more robust to mutation affecting stiffness, as
binding becomes more and more cooperative with stiffness up to the same
characteristic value $k_a^*$, beyond which cooperativity saturates instead of
decaying. We confirm numerically these findings in a non-linear mechanical
model. Dynamical considerations suggest that a stiffness of order $k_a^*$ is
favorable in that scenario as well, supporting that for proper function
proteins must evolve a functional elastic mode that is softer as their size
increases. In consistency with this view, we find a significant anticorrelation
between the stiffness of the allosteric response and protein size in our data
set.

a new well-characterised object to the small sample of less than 20 transiting
brown dwarfs. One brown dwarf candidate was found by the KESPRINT consortium
when searching for exoplanets in the K2 space mission Campaign 16 field. We
combined the K2 photometric data with a series of multi-colour photometric
observations, imaging and radial velocity measurements to rule out false
positive scenarios and to determine the fundamental properties of the system.
We report the discovery and characterisation of a transiting brown dwarf in a
5.17 day eccentric orbit around the slightly evolved F7V star EPIC 212036875.
We find a stellar mass of 1.15+/-0.08 M$_\odot$, a stellar radius of
1.41+/-0.05 R$_\odot$, and an age of 5.1+/-0.9 Gyr. The mass and radius of the
companion brown dwarf are 51+/-2 MJ and 0.83+/-0.03 RJ, respectively,
corresponding to a mean density of 108+15-13 g cm-3. EPIC 212036875 b is a rare
object that resides in the brown dwarf desert. In the mass-density diagram for
planets, brown dwarfs and stars, we find that all giant planets and brown
dwarfs follow the same trend from ~0.3 MJ to the turn-over to hydrogen burning
stars at ~73 MJ. EPIC 212036875 b falls close to the theoretical model for
mature H/He dominated objects in this diagram as determined by interior
structure models, as well as the empirical fit. We argue that EPIC 212036875 b
formed via gravitational disc instabilities in the outer part of the disc,
followed by a quick migration. Orbital tidal circularisation may have started

observations of the propagation of surface water waves. The experiments in
question featured a periodically moving wavemaker located at one end of a flume
that generated unidirectional waves of relatively small amplitude and long
wavelength when compared with the undisturbed depth. It was observed that the
wave profile at any point down the channel very quickly became periodic in time
with the same period as that of the wavemaker. One of the questions dealt with
here is whether or not such a property holds for model equations for such
waves. In the present discussion, this is examined in the context of the
Korteweg-de Vries equation using the recently developed version of the inverse
scattering theory for boundary value problems put forward by Fokas and his
collaborators. It turns out that the Korteweg-de Vries equation does possess
the properly that solutions at a fixed point down the channel have the property
of asymptotic periodicity in time when forced periodically at the boundary.
However, a more subtle issue to do with conservation of mass fails to hold at
the second order in a small parameter which is the typical wave amplitude
divided by the undisturbed depth.

conversion. Yet, its band-edge absorption spectrum is narrower than the
spectrum of the solar radiation, which reduces its conversion efficiency. In
this paper, it is shown that the spectrum of absorbance of silicon can be
extended to longer wavelengths by proximity to a two-dimensional (2D)
semiconductor. Photo-induced Hall effect, together with standard absorption
spectroscopy, was employed to estimate the increase of efficiency of absorbance
of a 2D-platinum-diselenide/intrinsic-silicon bilayer. The bilayer shows a
significantly higher absorption in the infrared as compared to the single
films. Moreover, an overall increase of absorption efficiency by a factor
twenty was measured in the entire spectrum of light of a halogen lamp. X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) confirms that a reduction of the band-gap
occurs in the silicon substrate at the interface between the two
semiconductors. The results are interpreted in the framework of band-gap
narrowing due to hole-plasma confinement in the Si, induced by
electron-confinement in the 2D film. Possible application of the effect in
photo-voltaic cells is discussed.

fundamental challenge lies in obtaining high-quality annotations of (utterance,

overcome this, we propose a novel framework to build a unified multi-domain
enabled semantic parser trained only with weak supervision (denotations).
Weakly supervised training is particularly arduous as the program search space
grows exponentially in a multi-domain setting. To solve this, we incorporate a
multi-policy distillation mechanism in which we first train domain-specific
semantic parsers (teachers) using weak supervision in the absence of the ground
truth programs, followed by training a single unified parser (student) from the
domain specific policies obtained from these teachers. The resultant semantic
parser is not only compact but also generalizes better, and generates more
accurate programs. It further does not require the user to provide a domain
label while querying. On the standard Overnight dataset (containing multiple
domains), we demonstrate that the proposed model improves performance by 20% in

checks the existence of power-law distributions in the time series from tweet

carry out precision Radial Velocity (RV) measurements. In the current design,
major factors limiting the RV precision of the spectrograph arise from the
movable grating and slit; optical aberrations; positional uncertainty
associated with optomechanical mounts and environmental and thermal
instabilities in the spectrograph room. RV instabilities due to temperature and
pressure variations in the environment are estimated to vary around 120 $
\textrm{ms}^{-1} $ and 400 $ \textrm{ms}^{-1} $ respectively. The positional
uncertainty of the grating in the spectrograph could induce a spectral shift
$\sim1.4\,\textrm{kms}^{-1} $ across the Echelle orders. A Zemax model is used
to overcome the uncertainty in the zero-positioning and lack of repeatability
of the moving components. We propose to obtain the ThAr lamp observations and
using the Zemax model as the reference, predict the drifts in the positions of
the optical components. The perturbations of the optical components from the
nominal position are corrected at the beginning of the observational run. After
a good match is obtained between the model and the observations, we propose to

Furthermore, our method can be combined with standard IVS models in

implementing an efficient low level joint torque control. In a set of coupled
joints, the actuators torques are mapped to the output joint torques through a
coupling matrix, such that the motor torque and friction parameters appear
entangled from the point of view of the joints. As a result, their
identification is problematic when using the same methodology as for single
joints. This paper proposes an identification method with an improved accuracy
with respect to classical closed loop methods on coupled joints. The method
stands out through the following key points: it is a direct open loop
identification; it addresses separately each motor in the coupling; it accounts
for the static friction in the actuation elements. The identified parameters
should significantly improve the contribution of the feed-forward terms in the
low level control of coupled joints with static friction.

were found in data from the Arecibo 327-MHz Drift-Scan Pulsar Survey (AO327).
All these pulsars have a low dispersion measure (DM) ($\lesssim 45 \, \rm{pc}\,
cm^{-3}$), and have a DM-determined distance of $\lesssim$ 3 kpc. Their timing
solutions, have data spans ranging from 1 to $\sim$ 7 years, include precise
estimates of their spin and astrometric parameters, and for the binaries,
precise estimates of their Keplerian binary parameters. Their orbital periods
range from about 4 to 815 days and the minimum companion masses (assuming a
pulsar mass of 1.4 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$) range from $\sim$ 0.06--1.11
$\rm{M_{\odot}}$. For two of the binaries we detect post-Keplerian parameters;
in the case of PSR~J0709$+$0458 we measure the component masses but with a low

dependent on RSOC, magnetization strength and its orientation, and
singlet-triplet mixing of the gap parameter. It is observed that NCSC with
moderate RSOC shows maximum conductance for a partially opaque barrier in
presence of low external magnetic field. For a strongly opaque barrier and a
nearly transparent barrier a moderate value and a low value of field
respectively are found to be suitable. Moreover, NCSC with large singlet
component is appeared to be useful. In addition, for NCSC with large RSOC and
low magnetization strength, a giant STMR ($\%$) is observed. We have also seen
that the spin current is strongly magnetization orientation dependent. With the

it possible to adapt the network behavior to the specific requirements of the

improve the radiative recombination efficiency. Yet, single-layered
two-dimensional (2D) perovskite films are strongly limited by trap-assisted
recombination and suffer from low luminescence yields, hampering their
application in electroluminescence devices. Here, we use ad hoc synthetic and
defect engineering strategies to overcome such issue. We employ metallic doping
to controllably introduce luminescent impurities in a matrix made of 2D
perovskite $NMA_{2}PbX_{4}$ based on the cation NMA = 1-naphtylmethylammonium.
By means of temperature-dependent and time-resolved spectroscopy we demonstrate
efficient energy transfer to $Mn^{2+}$ centres. Such process avoids the
funnelling of the photo-excited species in inefficient recombination channels
represented by intra-gap trap states and enhances photoluminescence, with
quantum yield surpassing 20% in doped films. Eventually, we embody Mn-doped
$NMA_{2}PbBr_{4}$ in a light emitting diode architecture and show, for the
first time, electroluminescence from the $Mn^{2+}:^{4}T_{1}-^{6}A_{1}$

i.e., $n$-vertex, $d$-regular graphs with all nontrivial eigenvalues in the
interval $[-\lambda,\lambda]$. Krivelevich, Lee, and Sudakov conjectured that,
whenever $\lambda^{2k-1}\ll d^{2k}/n$, every subgraph $G$ of $\Gamma$ with
$(1/2+o(1))e(\Gamma)$ edges contains an odd cycle $C_{2k+1}$. Aigner-Horev,
H\`{a}n, and the third author proved a weaker statement by allowing an extra
polylogarithmic factor in the assumption $\lambda^{2k-1}\ll d^{2k}/n$, but we
completely remove it and hence settle the conjecture. This also generalises
Sudakov, Szabo, and Vu's Tur\'{a}n-type theorem for triangles.
  Secondly, we obtain a Ramsey multiplicity result for odd cycles. Namely, in
the same range of parameters, we prove that every 2-edge-colouring of $\Gamma$
contains at least $(1-o(1))2^{-2k}d^{2k+1}$ monochromatic copies of $C_{2k+1}$.
Both results are asymptotically best possible by Alon and Kahale's construction

are solved using Runge-Kutta method of the fourth order. The simulations show

In the region $r<0.2$ au, the MFT of radii $0.05 \leq a_0 \leq 0.16\,H$ ($H$ is
the scale height of the disc) with initial plasma beta of 1 experience thermal
oscillations above the disc. The oscillations decay over some time, and MFT
continue upward motion afterwards. Thinner or thicker MFT do not oscillate. MFT
velocity increases with initial radius and magnetic field strength. MFT rise
periodically with velocities up to 5-15 km s$^{-1}$ and periods of $0.5-10$ yr
determined by the toroidal magnetic field generation time. Approximately 20 %
of disc mass and magnetic flux can escape to disc atmosphere via the magnetic
buoyancy over characteristic time of disc evolution. MFT dispersal forms
expanding magnetized corona of the disc. External magnetic field causes MFT
oscillations near the disc surface. These magnetic oscillations have periods
from several days to 1-3 months at $r < 0.6$ au. The magnetic oscillations
decay over few periods. We simulate MFT dynamics in accretion discs in the
Chameleon I cluster. The simulations demonstrate that MFT oscillations can
produce observed IR-variability of T Tauri stars.

phylogenetic inference frameworks. Early models made the simplifying assumption
that the substitution process is homogeneous over time and across sites in the
molecular sequence alignment. While standard practice adopts extensions that
accommodate heterogeneity of substitution rates across sites, heterogeneity in
the process over time in a site-specific manner remains frequently overlooked.
This is problematic, as evolutionary processes that act at the molecular level
are highly variable, subjecting different sites to different selective
constraints over time, impacting their substitution behaviour. We propose
incorporating time variability through Markov-modulated models (MMMs) that
allow the substitution process (including relative character exchange rates as
well as the overall substitution rate) that models the evolution at an
individual site to vary across lineages. We implement a general MMM framework
in BEAST, a popular Bayesian phylogenetic inference software package, allowing
researchers to compose a wide range of MMMs through flexible XML specification.
Using examples from bacterial, viral and plastid genome evolution, we show that
MMMs impact phylogenetic tree estimation and can substantially improve model
fit compared to standard substitution models. Through simulations, we show that
marginal likelihood estimation accurately identifies the generative model and
does not systematically prefer the more parameter-rich MMMs. In order to
mitigate the increased computational demands associated with MMMs, our
implementation exploits recently developed updates to BEAGLE, a
high-performance computational library for phylogenetic inference.

that are in place by z~7 is that there was an earlier phase of very rapid
accretion onto direct collapse black holes (DCBH) that started their lives with
masses ~ 10^4-10^5 M_solar. Working in this scenario, we show that the mass
function of SMBH after such a limited time period with growing formation rate
paired with super-Eddington accretion can be described as a broken power-law
with two characteristic features. There is a power-law at intermediate masses
whose index is the dimensionless ratio {\alpha} = {\lambda}/{\gamma}, where
{\lambda} is the growth rate of the number of DCBH during their formation era,
and {\gamma} is the growth rate of DCBH masses by super-Eddington accretion
during the DCBH growth era. A second feature is a break in the power law
profile at high masses, above which the mass function declines rapidly. The
location of the break is related to the dimensionless number \b{eta} = {\gamma}
T, where T is the duration of the period of DCBH growth. If the SMBH continue
to grow at later times at an Eddington-limited accretion rate, then the
observed quasar luminosity function can be directly related to the tapered
power-law function derived in this paper.

tag, organize, share, and search for contents are becoming more popular. These
systems have a lot of valuable information, but data growth is one of its
biggest challenges and this has led to the need for recommender systems that
will predict what each user may like or need. One approach to the design of
these systems which uses social environment of users is known as collaborative
filtering (CF). One of the problems in CF systems is trustworthy of users and
their tags. In this work, we consider a trust metric (which is concluded from
users tagging behavior) beside the similarities to give suggestions and examine
its effect on results. On the other hand, a decentralized approach is
introduced which calculates similarity and trust relationships between users in
a distributed manner. This causes the capability of implementing the proposed
approach among all types of users with respect to different types of items,
which are accessed by unique id across heterogeneous networks and environments.
Finally, we show that the proposed model for calculating similarities between
users reduces the size of the user-item matrix and considering trust in
collaborative systems can lead to a better performance in generating
suggestions.

While the field theory provides details on the properties of the system close

This turns out to be an efficient tool to study the behavior of boundary
gradient blow-up (GBU) for the parabolic problem in general bounded domains.
Namely, we show that in a neighborhood of the boundary, at leading order,
solutions display a global ODE type behavior, with domination of the normal
derivatives upon the tangential derivatives. This leads to the existence of a
universal, sharp blow-up profile in the normal direction at any GBU point, and
moreover implies that the behavior in the tangential direction is more
singular. On the other hand, it is known that any GBU solution admits a weak

Therefore, in this work, we focus on leveraging structural properties of graphs

dramatically speed up query evaluation. We present KASKADE, the first graph
query optimization framework to exploit materialized graph views for query
optimization purposes. KASKADE employs a novel constraint-based view
enumeration technique that mines constraints from query workloads and graph
schemas, and injects them during view enumeration to significantly reduce the
search space of views to be considered. Moreover, it introduces a graph view
size estimator to pick the most beneficial views to materialize given a query
set and to select the best query evaluation plan given a set of materialized
views. We evaluate its performance over real-world graphs, including the
provenance graph that we maintain at Microsoft to enable auditing, service

grow as $a^2$, in terms of the scale factor, instead of the Newtonian
$a^{1/2}$-law. We attribute this to the fact that, in general relativity, the
energy flux, triggered here by the peculiar motion of the matter, also
contributes to the local gravitational field. In a sense, the bulk flow
gravitates, an effect that has been bypassed in related relativistic studies.
These stronger growth-rates imply faster peculiar velocities at horizon
crossing and higher residual values for the peculiar-velocity field.
Alternatively, one could say that our study favours bulk peculiar flows larger
and faster than anticipated.

  Predictive Coding Theory",,,,,"cs.MM cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective quality assessment of stereoscopic omnidirectional images is a
challenging problem since it is influenced by multiple aspects such as
projection deformation, field of view (FoV) range, binocular vision, visual
comfort, etc. Existing studies show that classic 2D or 3D image quality
assessment (IQA) metrics are not able to perform well for stereoscopic
omnidirectional images. However, very few research works have focused on
evaluating the perceptual visual quality of omnidirectional images, especially
for stereoscopic omnidirectional images. In this paper, based on the predictive
coding theory of the human vision system (HVS), we propose a stereoscopic
omnidirectional image quality evaluator (SOIQE) to cope with the
characteristics of 3D 360-degree images. Two modules are involved in SOIQE:
predictive coding theory based binocular rivalry module and multi-view fusion
module. In the binocular rivalry module, we introduce predictive coding theory
to simulate the competition between high-level patterns and calculate the
similarity and rivalry dominance to obtain the quality scores of viewport
images. Moreover, we develop the multi-view fusion module to aggregate the
quality scores of viewport images with the help of both content weight and
location weight. The proposed SOIQE is a parametric model without necessary of
regression learning, which ensures its interpretability and generalization
performance. Experimental results on our published stereoscopic omnidirectional
image quality assessment database (SOLID) demonstrate that our proposed SOIQE
method outperforms state-of-the-art metrics. Furthermore, we also verify the
effectiveness of each proposed module on both public stereoscopic image
datasets and panoramic image datasets.

model which combines both these features, showing that scale-free avalanches
are the signature of a system posed near the spinodal line of a first order
transition, with many spatio-temporal patterns stored as dynamical metastable
attractors. Specifically, we studied a network of leaky integrate and fire
neurons, whose connections are the result of the learning of multiple
spatio-temporal dynamical patterns, each with a randomly chosen ordering of the
neurons. We found that the network shows a first order transition between a low
spiking rate disordered state (down), and a high rate state characterized by
the emergence of collective activity and the replay of one of the stored
patterns (up). The transition is characterized by hysteresis, or alternation of
up and down states, depending on the lifetime of the metastable states. In both
cases, critical features and neural avalanches are observed. Notably, critical
phenomena occur at the edge of a discontinuous phase transition, as recently
observed in a network of glow lamps.

hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) Mg matrix forms a local face-centered-cubic (fcc)
environment, and hence our thermodynamic analysis is based on the Gibbs energy
comparison between hcp and fcc phases over the Mg-Zn-Y ternary composition
ranges, using the calculation of phase diagrams (CALPHAD) method aided by the
first principles calculations. Segregation behaviors of solute Zn/Y atoms into
the SESF are firstly estimated according to the Hillert's parallel tangent law,
followed by the possible disorder-order phase transformation within the SESF
using the multiple-sublattice model. We find that the Zn/Y co-segregations at
the SESF provide a remarkable condition that the fcc layers become more stable
than the hcp-Mg matrix. Besides, within the SESF, the following spinodal-like
decomposition into the Mg-rich solid-solution and the Zn/Y-rich L12-type order
phase causes a significant reduction of the total Gibbs energy of the system.
These thermodynamic behaviors explain fairly well a phenomenological origin of
the Zn-Y clustering with the L12-type short-range order, which is known to
occur for the LPSO phases and also confirmed for the present SESF by electron
microscopy experiments. Therefore, strong Zn-Y interactions even in dilute

Superfluidity of matter on the microscopic scale can have a number of large
scale, potentially observable consequences, as the superfluid component of the
star can now flow relative to the `normal' component that is tracked by
electromagnetic emission. The most spectacular of such phenomena are pulsar
glitches, sudden spin-ups observed in many pulsars. A background flow of a
normal-fluid component with respect to the superfluid is also known to lead to
a number of instabilities in laboratory superfluids, possibly leading to
turbulence and modifying the nature of the mutual friction coupling between the
two fluids. In this paper we consider modes of oscillation in the crust and
core of a superfluid neutron star, by conducting a plane-wave analysis. We
explicitly account for a background flow between the two components (as would
be expected in the presence of pinning) and the entrainment, and we consider
both standard (Hall-Vinen) and isotropic (Gorter-Mellink) forms of the mutual
friction. We find that for standard mutual friction there are families of
unstable inertial and sound waves both in the case of a counter-flow along the
superfluid vortex axis and for counterflow perpendicular to the vortex axis and
find that entrainment leads to a quantitative difference between instabilities
in the crust and core of the star. For isotropic mutual friction we find no
unstable modes, and speculate that instabilities in a straight vortex array may
be linked to glitching behaviour, which then ceases until the turbulence has
decayed.

exhaustive search methods require excessive computation time to depict the GRD

an Robust Axial-Monotonic Clough-Tocher (RAMCT) interpolation method to model
the GRD function. This model allows us to accurately reconstruct the complete

extinction-free measurements of the luminosities and spectral indicies for a

planets. Based on the weak-friction model, we derive expressions of the
resulting forces and torques considering complete tidal interactions between
all the bodies of the system. Although the tidal deformation suffered by each
extended mass must take into account the combined gravitational effects of the
other two bodies, the only tidal forces that have a net effect on the dynamic
are those that are applied on the same body that exerts the deformation, as
long as no mean-motion resonance exists between the masses. We apply the model
to the Kepler-38 binary system. The evolution of the spin equations shows that
the planet reaches a stationary solution much faster than the stars, and the
equilibrium spin frequency is sub-synchronous. The binary components evolve on
a longer timescale, reaching a super-synchronous solution very close to that
derived for the 2-body problem. After reaching spin stationarity, the
eccentricity is damped in all bodies and for all the parameters analyzed here.
A similar effect is noted for the binary separation. The semimajor axis of the
planet, on the other hand, may migrate inwards or outwards, depending on the
masses and orbital parameters. In some cases the secular evolution of the
system may also exhibit an alignment of the pericenters, requiring to include
additional terms in the tidal model. Finally, we derived analytical expressions
for the variational equations of the orbital evolution and spin rates based on
low-order elliptical expansions in the semimajor axis ratio and the
eccentricities. These are found to reduce to the 2-body case when one of the
masses is taken equal to zero. This model allow us to find a close and simple
analytical expression for the stationary spin rates of all the bodies, as well
as predicting the direction and magnitude of the orbital migration.

remembering -- i.e measuring how quickly the network recovers performance

domains including healthcare, social media, and crime surveillance. Detecting
anomalies, or irregular and rare events, in time series data, can enable us to
find abnormal events in any natural phenomena, which may require special
treatment. Moreover, labeled instances of anomaly are hard to get in time
series data. On the other hand, time series data, due to its nature, often
exhibits localized expansions and compressions in the time dimension which is
called warping. These two challenges make it hard to detect anomalies in time
series as often such warpings could get detected as anomalies erroneously. Our
objective is to build an anomaly detection model that is robust to such warping
variations. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised time series anomaly
detection method, WaRTEm-AD, that operates in two stages. Within the key stage
of representation learning, we employ data augmentation through bespoke time
series operators which are passed through a twin autoencoder architecture to
learn warping-robust representations for time series data. Second, adaptations
of state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods are employed on the learnt
representations to identify anomalies. We will illustrate that WaRTEm-AD is
designed to detect two types of time series anomalies: point and sequence

in combination with the Mordell--Weil sieve. Often the quadratic points are not
finite, as the degree 2 map $X_0(N)\to X_0(N)^+$ can be a source of infinitely
many such points. In such cases, we describe this map and the rational points
on $X_0(N)^+$, and we specify the exceptional quadratic points on $X_0(N)$ not

items with the correct order out of $n$ items using pairwise comparisons. In
many applications, multiple rounds of interaction can be costly. We restrict
our attention to algorithms with a constant number of rounds $r$ and try to
minimize the sample complexity, i.e. the number of comparisons.
  When the comparisons are noiseless, we characterize how the optimal sample
complexity depends on the number of rounds (up to a polylogarithmic factor for
general $r$ and up to a constant factor for $r=1$ or 2). In particular, the
sample complexity is $\Theta(n^2)$ for $r=1$, $\Theta(n\sqrt{k} + n^{4/3})$ for
$r=2$ and $\tilde{\Theta}\left(n^{2/r} k^{(r-1)/r} + n\right)$ for $r \geq 3$.
  We extend our results of sorted top-$k$ to the noisy case where each
comparison is correct with probability $2/3$. When $r=1$ or 2, we show that the
sample complexity gets an extra $\Theta(\log(k))$ factor when we transition
from the noiseless case to the noisy case.

Document Explorer iteratively selects relevant documents and represents
divergent reasoning chains in a tree structure so as to allow assimilating
information from all chains. The Answer Proposer then proposes an answer from
every root-to-leaf path in the reasoning tree. Finally, the Evidence Assembler
extracts a key sentence containing the proposed answer from every path and
combines them to predict the final answer. Intuitively, EPAr approximates the
coarse-to-fine-grained comprehension behavior of human readers when facing
multiple long documents. We jointly optimize our 3 modules by minimizing the
sum of losses from each stage conditioned on the previous stage's output. On
two multi-hop reading comprehension datasets WikiHop and MedHop, our EPAr model

configuration of the Galactic magnetic field. In particular, the Galactic
center (GC) region provides highly interesting cosmic-ray data from gamma-ray
maps and it is clear that a large fraction of the cosmic rays detected at Earth
originate in this region of the Galaxy. Yet because of confusion from
line-of-sight integration, the magnetic field structure in the Galactic center
is not well known and no large-scale magnetic field model exists at present.
Aims: In this paper, we develop a magnetic field model, derived from
observational data on the diffuse gas, nonthermal radio filaments, and
molecular clouds. Methods. We derive an analytical description of the magnetic
field structure in the central molecular zone by combining observational data
with the theoretical modeling of the basic properties of magnetic fields.
Results. We provide a first description of the large-scale magnetic field in
the Galactic center region. We present first test simulations of cosmic-ray
propagation and the impact of the magnetic field structure on the cosmic-ray
distribution in the three dimensions. Conclusions: Our magnetic field model is
able to describe the main features of polarization maps; it is particularly
important to note that they are significantly better than standard global
Galactic magnetic field models. It can also be used to model cosmic-ray
propagation in the Galactic Center region more accurately.

pursue this possibility. A statistical mechanics model for a magnet, the Ising

Since 1960, several statistical methods have been developed to reduce the
standard deviation of the estimate. In this paper, we develop an algorithm that
uses a pair of negatively correlated samples to reduce the variance of the

is ergodic (obeys the strong law of large numbers), hence the name ""ergodic
sampling"". Unlike Shapley and Mann, we do not use heuristics, the algorithm
uses a small sample to learn the best ergodic transformation for a given game.
We illustrate the algorithm on eight games with different characteristics to

independent sample, and in five test games, it significantly improves the

the light tower of states. We also discuss implications of the conjecture for

are prone to be contaminated by accumulated error and large numerical
dissipation. Recently, based on the gas kinetic models, the implicit unified
gas kinetic scheme (UGKS) and its variants have significantly reduced the
iterations in the near-continuum flow regime, but still much higher than that
of the highly rarefied gas flows. In this paper, we put forward a general
synthetic iteration scheme (GSIS) to find the steady-state solutions of general
rarefied gas flows within dozens of iterations at any Knudsen number. As the
GSIS does not rely on the specific kinetic model/collision operator, it can be
naturally extended to quickly find converged solutions for mixture flows and
even flows involving chemical reactions. These two superior advantages are also
expected to accelerate the slow convergence in simulation of near-continuum
flows via the direct simulation Monte Carlo method and its low-variance
version.

novel adversarial training framework is formulated to learn an anonymization
transform for input videos such that the trade-off between target utility task
performance and the associated privacy budgets is explicitly optimized on the
anonymized videos. Notably, the privacy budget, often defined and measured in
task-driven contexts, cannot be reliably indicated using any single model
performance because strong protection of privacy should sustain against any
malicious model that tries to steal private information. To tackle this
problem, we propose two new optimization strategies of model restarting and
model ensemble to achieve stronger universal privacy protection against any
attacker models. Extensive experiments have been carried out and analyzed. On
the other hand, given few public datasets available with both utility and
privacy labels, the data-driven (supervised) learning cannot exert its full
power on this task. We first discuss an innovative heuristic of cross-dataset
training and evaluation, enabling the use of multiple single-task datasets (one

periodically retrain the models on the current sample. This approach speeds up
the training process relative to training on all of the data. Moreover,
time-biasing lets the models adapt to recent changes in the data while---unlike
in a sliding-window approach---still keeping some old data to ensure robustness
in the face of temporary fluctuations and periodicities in the data values. In
addition, the sampling-based approach allows existing analytic algorithms for
static data to be applied to dynamic streaming data essentially without change.
We provide and analyze both a simple sampling scheme (T-TBS) that
probabilistically maintains a target sample size and a novel reservoir-based
scheme (R-TBS) that is the first to provide both control over the decay rate
and a guaranteed upper bound on the sample size. If the decay function is
exponential, then control over the decay rate is complete, and R-TBS maximizes
both expected sample size and sample-size stability. For general decay
functions, the actual item inclusion probabilities can be made arbitrarily
close to the nominal probabilities, and we provide a scheme that allows a
trade-off between sample footprint and sample-size stability. The R-TBS and
T-TBS schemes are of independent interest, extending the known set of
unequal-probability sampling schemes. We discuss distributed implementation

the algorithms, and show that our approach can increase machine learning

Fokker-Planck equations with both deterministic and stochastic contributions.
We show that the deterministic terms contain both the angular and speed

Growth alignment is determined by surface geometry, and it is quantified by the
deterministic part of the Langevin equation. We combine experimental data with
theoretical analysis to measure the key parameters of the growth cone motion:
speed and angular distributions, correlation functions, diffusion coefficients,
characteristics speeds and damping coefficients. We demonstrate that axonal
dynamics displays a cross-over from Brownian motion (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process) at earlier times to anomalous dynamics (superdiffusion) at later
times. The superdiffusive regime is characterized by non-Gaussian speed
distributions and power law dependence of the axonal mean square length and the

theoretically and experimentally for chiral metasurfaces formed by arrays of
metallic square helices. The helical particles of the metasurfaces are
constructed of rectangular bars manufactured by direct three-dimensional
printing in solid metal. The transmittance of the metasurface is found to
depend critically on the number of bars forming the square helical particles.
In the case of an even number of bars, the chiral metasurface exhibits
identical co-polarized transmittance of orthogonal linearly polarized waves,
which are characterized by a dual-band asymmetric transmission. For an odd
number of bars, the metasurface provides the same cross-polarization conversion
for any polarization orientation of the incident field and thus serves as a
polarization-independent twist polarizer. Finally, the transmittance of this
polarizer is investigated with respect to the dimensions of the square helices.
The investigated chiral metasurfaces are characterized by strong broadband
circular dichroism regardless of the number of bars in the helical particles.
The wide variety of transmission properties observed in the metasurfaces makes
them particularly attractive for use in polarization conversion and separation
devices.

cooperative sensing with multi-camera operation in an image-to-decision
proactive handover framework that directly maps images to a handover decision.
In the framework, camera images are utilized to allow for the prediction of
blockage effects in a mmWave link, whereby a network controller triggers a
handover in a proactive fashion. Furthermore, direct mapping allows for the
scalability of the number of pedestrians. This paper experimentally
investigates the feasibility of adopting cooperative sensing with multiple
cameras that can compensate for one another's blind spots. The optimal mapping
is learned via deep reinforcement learning to resolve the high dimensionality
of images from multiple cameras. An evaluation based on experimentally obtained
images and received powers verifies that a mapping that enhances channel
capacity can be learned in a multi-camera operation. The results indicate that
our proposed framework with multi-camera operation outperforms a conventional
framework with single-camera operation in terms of the average capacity.

this paper, we propose a method to automatically detect and correct

under-sampled k-space reconstruction. Our main methodological contribution is
the addition of a detection network to classify motion-corrupted k-space lines
to convert the problem of artefact correction to a problem of reconstruction
using the data consistency term. We train our network to automatically correct
for motion-related artefacts using synthetically corrupted cine CMR k-space
data as well as uncorrupted CMR images. Using a test set of 50 2D+time cine CMR
datasets from the UK Biobank, we achieve good image quality in the presence of
synthetic motion artefacts. We quantitatively compare our method with a variety
of techniques for recovering good image quality and showcase better performance
compared to state of the art denoising techniques with a PSNR of 37.1.
Moreover, we show that our method preserves the quality of uncorrupted images

destabilized by the individual NBI lines, the interaction regime where the
multi beam AEs growth rate is smaller than the single NBI AEs and the damped

EP species with different density profile flatness or gradient locations. In

decrease of the n=2 to 6 AEs growth rate and n=1 AE are stabilized in the LHD

gravitational wave (GW) background. We measure the timing noise in a group of
129 mostly middle-aged pulsars (i.e. characterstic ages near 1~Myr) observed

different metrics for timing noise, but it remains unclear which, if any,

pulsars have significantly less timing noise than their younger counterparts,
but significantly more than the (much older) millisecond pulsars (MSPs). As
with previous authors, we find a strong correlation between timing noise and
the pulsar spin-down rate, $\dot{\nu}$. However, for a given $\dot{\nu}$ there
is a spread of about a factor 30 in the strength of the timing noise likely
indicating that nuclear conditions in the interior of the stars differs between
objects. We briefly comment on the implications for GW detection through pulsar
timing arrays as the level of timing noise in MSPs may be less than predicted.

to their higher performance relative to traditional methods. However, obtaining
the expected performance of deep learning-based systems requires large amounts

hinders the utilization of such deep learning approaches. In this paper, we
introduce a number of techniques for addressing the data collection problem for
deep learning-based cellular localization systems. The basic idea is to
generate synthetic data that reflects the typical pattern of the wireless data
as observed from a small collected dataset. Evaluation of the proposed data
augmentation techniques using different Android phones in a cellular
localization case study shows that we can enhance the performance of the
localization systems in both indoor and outdoor scenarios by 157% and 50.5%,
respectively. This highlights the promise of the proposed techniques for
enabling deep learning-based localization systems.

many computing segments. To make such systems resilient, we can adopt erasure
coding such as Reed-Solomon (RS) code as an alternative to replication because
erasure coding incurs a significantly lower storage overhead than replication.
To understand the impact of using erasure coding on the system performance and
other system aspects such as CPU utilization and network traffic, we build a
storage cluster that consists of approximately 100 processor cores with more
than 50 high-performance solid-state drives (SSDs), and evaluate the cluster
with a popular open-source distributed parallel file system, called Ceph.
Specifically, we analyze the behaviors of a system adopting erasure coding from
the following five viewpoints, and compare with those of another system using
replication: (1) storage system I/O performance; (2) computing and software
overheads; (3) I/O amplification; (4) network traffic among storage nodes, and
(5) impact of physical data layout on performance of RS-coded SSD arrays. For
all these analyses, we examine two representative RS configurations, used by
Google file systems, and compare them with triple replication employed by a
typical parallel file system as a default fault tolerance mechanism. Lastly, we
collect 96 block-level traces from the cluster and release them to the public
domain for the use of other researchers.

dedicated to improving our understanding of interbank lending networks (ILNs).
Because of data limitations or by choice, the literature largely lacks multiple
loan maturities. We employ a complete interbank loan contract dataset to
investigate whether maturity details are informative of the network structure.
Applying the layered stochastic block model of Peixoto (2015) and other tools
from network science on a time series of bilateral loans with multiple maturity
layers in the Russian ILN, we find that collapsing all such layers consistently
obscures mesoscale structure. The optimal maturity granularity lies between
completely collapsing and completely separating the maturity layers and depends
on the development phase of the interbank market, with a more developed market
requiring more layers for optimal description. Closer inspection of the
inferred maturity bins associated with the optimal maturity granularity reveals
specific economic functions, from liquidity intermediation to financing.
Collapsing a network with multiple underlying maturity layers or extracting one
such layer, common in economic research, is therefore not only an incomplete
representation of the ILN's mesoscale structure, but also conceals existing
economic functions. This holds important insights and opportunities for
theoretical and empirical studies on interbank market functioning, contagion,
stability, and on the desirable level of regulatory data disclosure.

underlying physical state, it is often assumed that consciousness is
algorithmic and that conscious states can be copied, such as by copying or
digitizing the human brain. In an effort to further elucidate the physical
nature of consciousness, I challenge these assumptions and attempt to prove the
Single Stream of Consciousness Theorem (SSCT): that a conscious entity cannot
experience more than one stream of consciousness from a given conscious state.
Assuming only that consciousness is a purely physical phenomenon, it is shown
that both Special Relativity and Multiverse theory independently imply SSCT and
that the Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics is inadequate to
counter it. Then, SSCT is shown to be incompatible with Strong Artificial
Intelligence, implying that consciousness cannot be created or simulated by a
computer. Finally, SSCT is shown to imply that a conscious state cannot be
physically reset to an earlier conscious state nor can it be duplicated by any
physical means. The profound but counterintuitive implications of these
conclusions are briefly discussed.

event systems subject to cyber attacks is considered. An operator observes a
plant through a natural projection that hides the occurrence of certain events.
The objective of the operator is that of estimating the current state of the
system. The observation is corrupted by an attacker which can tamper with the
readings of a set of sensors thus inserting some fake events or erasing some
observations. The aim of the attacker is that of altering the state estimation
of the operator. An automaton, called joint estimator, is defined to describe
the set of all possible attacks. In more details, an unbounded joint estimator
is obtained by concurrent composition of two state observers, the attacker
observer and the operator observer. The joint estimator shows, for each
possible corrupted observation, the joint state estimation, i.e., the set of
states consistent with the uncorrupted observation and the set of states
consistent with the corrupted observation. Such a structure can be used to
establish if an attack function is harmful w.r.t. a misleading relation. Our
approach is also extended to the case in which the attacker may insert at most
n events between two consecutive observations.

manual labeling of medical images. The emergence of data-driven approaches such
as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) brought this issue of raters' disagreement to
the front-stage. In this paper, we highlight the issue of inter-rater bias as
opposed to random inter-observer variability and demonstrate its influence on
DNN training, leading to different segmentation results for the same input
images. In fact, lower overlap scores are obtained between the outputs of a DNN
trained on annotations of one rater and tested on another. Moreover, we
demonstrate that inter-rater bias in the training examples is amplified and
becomes more consistent, considering the segmentation predictions of the DNNs'
test data. We support our findings by showing that a classifier-DNN trained to
distinguish between raters based on their manual annotations performs better
when the automatic segmentation predictions rather than the actual raters'
annotations were tested. For this study, we used two different datasets: the
ISBI 2015 Multiple Sclerosis (MS) challenge dataset, including MRI scans each
with annotations provided by two raters with different levels of expertise; and
Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH) CT scans with manual and semi-manual
segmentations. The results obtained allow us to underline a worrisome clinical
implication of a DNN bias induced by an inter-rater bias during training.
Specifically, we present a consistent underestimate of MS-lesion loads when
calculated from segmentation predictions of a DNN trained on input provided by
the less experienced rater. In the same manner, the differences in ICH volumes
calculated based on outputs of identical DNNs, each trained on annotations from
a different source are more consistent and larger than the differences in
volumes between the manual and semi-manual annotations used for training.

validated using a dataset of 763,848 images from 164,660 screening procedures
from the OPHDIAT screening program. For comparison purposes, it was also
evaluated in the public Messidor-2 dataset. Referable DR can be detected with
an area under the ROC curve of AUC = 0.989 in the Messidor-2 dataset, using the
University of Iowa's reference standard (95% CI: 0.984-0.994). This is
significantly better than the only AI system authorized by the FDA, evaluated
in the exact same conditions (AUC = 0.980). OphtAI can also detect
vision-threatening DR with an AUC of 0.997 (95% CI: 0.996-0.998) and
proliferative DR with an AUC of 0.997 (95% CI: 0.995-0.999). The system runs in
0.3 seconds using a graphics processing unit and less than 2 seconds without.
OphtAI is safer, faster and more comprehensive than the only AI system
authorized by the FDA so far. Instant DR diagnosis is now possible, which is
expected to streamline DR screening and to give easy access to DR screening to
more diabetic patients.

advancing analog and mixed-signal (AMS) design automation and computer-aided
design (CAD). Intelligent models for low-level analog building blocks are
needed to bridge the accuracy gap between behavioral and transistor-level
simulations. The models should be able to accurately estimate the
characteristics of the analog block over a large design space. Machine learning
(ML) models based on actual silicon have the capabilities of capturing detailed
characteristics of complex designs. In this paper, a ML model called Artificial
Neural Network Metamodels (ANNM) have been explored to capture the highly
nonlinear nature of analog blocks. The application of these intelligent models
to multi-objective AMS block optimization is demonstrated. Parameterized
behavioral models in Verilog-AMS based on the ANN metamodels are constructed
for efficient AMS design exploration. To the best of the authors' knowledge
this is the first paper to integrate ANN models in Verilog-AMS, which is called
iVAMS 2.0. To demonstrate the application of iVAMS 2.0, this paper presents two
case studies: an operational amplifier (OP-AMP) and a phase-locked loop (PLL).
A biologically-inspired ""firefly optimization algorithm"" is applied to an
OP-AMP design in the iVAMS 2.0 framework. The optimization process is sped up
by 5580X due to the use of iVAMS with negligible loss in accuracy. Similarly,
for a PLL design, the physical design aware ANNs are trained and used as
metamodels to predict its frequency, locking time, and power. Thorough
experimental results demonstrate that only 100 sample points are sufficient for
ANNs to predict the output of circuits with 21 design parameters within 3%
accuracy. A proposed artificial bee colony (ABC) based algorithm performs
optimization over the ANN metamodels of the PLL.

to create recommender systems. CF, however, suffers from data sparsity and the
cold-start problem since users often rate only a small fraction of available
items. One solution is to incorporate additional information into the
recommendation process such as explicit trust scores that are assigned by users
to others or implicit trust relationships that result from social connections
between users. Such relationships typically form a very sparse trust network,
which can be utilized to generate recommendations for users based on people
they trust. In our work, we explore the use of regular equivalence applied to a
trust network to generate a similarity matrix that is used for selecting
k-nearest neighbors used for item recommendation. Two vertices in a network are
regularly equivalent if their neighbors are themselves equivalent and by using
the iterative approach of calculating regular equivalence, we can study the
impact of strong and weak ties on item recommendation. We evaluate our approach
on cold-start users on a dataset crawled from Epinions and find that by using
weak ties in addition to strong ties, we can improve the performance of a
trust-based recommender in terms of recommendation accuracy.
