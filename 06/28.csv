  theory",,,"10.1016/j.aop.2020.168070",,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main aim of this paper is to obtain analytic relativistic anisotropic
spherical solutions in f(R,$\mathcal{T}$) scenario. To do so we use modified
Durgapal-Fuloria metric potential and the isotropic condition is imposed in
order to obtain the effective anisotropic factor $\tilde{\Delta}$. Besides, a
notable and viable election on f(R,$\mathcal{T}$) gravity formulation is taken.
Specifically $f(R,\mathcal{T})=R+2\chi\mathcal{T}$, where $R$ is the Ricci
scalar, $\mathcal{T}$ the trace of the energy-momentum tensor and $\chi$ a
dimensionless parameter. This choice of $f(R,\mathcal{T})$ function modifies
the matter sector only, including new ingredients to the physical parameters
that characterize the model such as density, radial, and tangential pressure.
Moreover, other important quantities are affected such as subliminal speeds of
the pressure waves in both radial and transverse direction, observational
parameters, for example, the surface redshift which is related with the total
mass $M$ and the radius $r_{s}$ of the compact object. Also, a transcendent
mechanism like equilibrium through generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff
equation and stability of the system are upset. We analyze all the physical and
mathematical general requirements of the configuration taking $M=1.04
M_{\odot}$ and varying $\chi$ from $-0.1$ to $0.1$. It is shown by the
graphical procedure that $\chi<0$ yields to a more compact object in comparison
when $\chi\geq0$ (where $\chi=0.0$ corresponds to general relativity theory)
and increases the value of the surface redshift. However, negative values of
$\chi$ introduce in the system an attractive anisotropic force (inward) and the
configuration is completely unstable (corroborated employing Abreu's
criterion). Furthermore, the model in Einstein gravity theory presents cracking
while for $\chi>0$ the system is fully stable.

Unfortunately, an exact calculation of these correlations involves $O(\ell_{\rm

making use of a large number of Gaussian but otherwise realistic simulations.
We show that, using the approximate covariance matrix, we are able to recover
the true posterior distribution of cosmological parameters to high accuracy. We
also quantify the shortcomings of these methods, which become unreliable on the

typical turbulence power spectrum with a spectral index ranging between $\sim
-5/3$ and $\sim -3/2$. In particular, at $1$ AU, the magnetic field spectrum,
observed within fast corotating streams, also shows a clear steepening for
frequencies higher than the typical proton scales, of the order of $\sim
3\times10^{-1}$ Hz, and a flattening towards $1/f$ at frequencies lower than
$\sim 10^{-3}$ Hz. However, the current literature reports observations of the
low-frequency break only for fast streams. Slow streams, as observed to date,
have not shown a clear break, and this has commonly been attributed to slow
wind intervals not being long enough. Actually, because of the longer transit
time from the Sun, slow wind turbulence would be older and the frequency break
would be shifted to lower frequencies with respect to fast wind. Based on this
hypothesis, we performed a careful search for long-lasting slow wind intervals
throughout $12$ years of Wind satellite measurements. Our search, based on
stringent requirements not only on wind speed but also on the level of magnetic
compressibility and Alfv\'enicity of the turbulent fluctuations, yielded $48$
slow wind streams lasting longer than $7$ days. This result allowed us to
extend our study to frequencies sufficiently low and, for the first time in the
literature, we are able to show that the $1/f$ magnetic spectral scaling is
also present in the slow solar wind, provided the interval is long enough.
However, this is not the case for the slow wind velocity spectrum, which keeps
the typical Kolmogorov scaling throughout the analysed frequency range. After
ruling out the possible role of compressibility and Alfv\'enicity for the 1/f
scaling, a possible explanation in terms of magnetic amplitude saturation, as
recently proposed in the literature, is suggested.

aggregate, through alignment, different but related datasets. Optimal transport
(OT)-based approaches pose alignment as a divergence minimization problem: the
aim is to transform a source dataset to match a target dataset using the
Wasserstein distance as a divergence measure. We introduce a hierarchical
formulation of OT which leverages clustered structure in data to improve
alignment in noisy, ambiguous, or multimodal settings. To solve this
numerically, we propose a distributed ADMM algorithm that also exploits the
Sinkhorn distance, thus it has an efficient computational complexity that
scales quadratically with the size of the largest cluster. When the
transformation between two datasets is unitary, we provide performance
guarantees that describe when and how well aligned cluster correspondences can
be recovered with our formulation, as well as provide worst-case dataset
geometry for such a strategy. We apply this method to synthetic datasets that
model data as mixtures of low-rank Gaussians and study the impact that
different geometric properties of the data have on alignment. Next, we applied
our approach to a neural decoding application where the goal is to predict
movement directions and instantaneous velocities from populations of neurons in
the macaque primary motor cortex. Our results demonstrate that when clustered
structure exists in datasets, and is consistent across trials or time points, a
hierarchical alignment strategy that leverages such structure can provide
significant improvements in cross-domain alignment.

orbital motion of absorbing nanoparticles in the vicinity of the scatterer. We

limits on the amount of circumplanetary dust to be derived from detailed
radiative transfer models. These protolunar disc models consider two disc
sizes: 0.4 and 0.04 times the exoplanet's Hill radius. The former is
representative of hydrodynamic simulations of circumplanetary discs while the
latter a case with significant radial drift of solids. The more compact case is
also motivated by the semi-major axis of Callisto, enclosing Jupiter's Galilean
satellites. All upper limits fall below the expected amount of dust required to
explain regular satellite systems ($10^{-4}$ times the mass of their central

Similarly to light holography, it uses the phase difference between the probe

events for the reconstruction of the target and for ascertaining any changes
that may occur. These are major advantages over other attosecond imaging
techniques, which require elaborate interferometric schemes in order to extract
phase differences. For that reason, ultrafast photoelectron holography has
experienced a huge growth in activity, which has led to a vast, but fragmented

Lebesgue integrals (with respect to Lebesgue measure). A space of primitives is
taken as the set of continuous real-valued functions $F(x,y)$ defined on the
extended real plane $[-\infty,\infty]^2$ that vanish when $x$ or $y$ is
$-\infty$. With usual pointwise operations this is a Banach space under the
uniform norm. The integrable functions and distributions (generalised
functions) are those that are the distributional derivative
$\partial^2/(\partial x\partial y)$ of this space of primitives. If
$f=\partial^2/(\partial x\partial y) F$ then the integral over interval
$[a,b]\times [c,d] \subseteq[-\infty,\infty]^2$ is $\int_a^b\int_c^d
f=F(a,c)+F(b,d)-F(a,d)-F(b,c)$ and $\int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty
f=F(\infty,\infty)$. The definition then builds in the fundamental theorem of
calculus. The Alexiewicz norm is ${\lVert f\rVert}={\lVert F\rVert}_\infty$
where $F$ is the unique primitive of $f$. The space of integrable distributions
is then a separable Banach space isometrically isomorphic to the space of
primitives. The space of integrable distributions is the completion of both
$L^1$ and the space of Henstock--Kurzweil integrable functions. The Banach
lattice and Banach algebra structures of the continuous functions in ${\lVert

shown that the dual space are the functions of bounded Hardy--Krause variation.
Various tools that make these integrals useful in applications are proved:
integration by parts, H\""older inequality, second mean value theorem, Fubini
theorem, a convergence theorem, change of variables, convolution. The changes
necessary to define the integral in ${\mathbb R}^n$ are sketched out.

topics: (1) The steady-state regime of quantum motors and pumps, paying
particular attention to the role of higher-order terms in the nonadiabatic
expansion of the current-induced forces. (2) The thermodynamical properties of
such systems, emphasizing systematic ways of studying the relationship between
different energy fluxes (charge and heat currents, and mechanical power)
passing through the system when beyond-first-order expansions are required. We
derive a general order-by-order scheme based on energy conservation to
rationalize how every order of the expansion of one form of energy flux is
connected with the others. We use this approach to give a physical
interpretation of the leading terms of the expansion. Finally, we illustrate
the above-discussed topics in a double quantum dot within the Coulomb-blockade

features of this system for arbitrary nonequilibrium conditions: A definite
parity of the expansion coefficients with respect to the voltage or temperature
biases; negative friction coefficients; and the fact that, under fixed

setting in order to exploit the internals of a model, which have not been
effectively utilized by previous work. Leveraging new insights about how
overfitting occurs in deep neural networks, we show how a model's idiosyncratic
use of features can provide evidence for membership to white-box
attackers---even when the model's black-box behavior appears to generalize
well---and demonstrate that this attack outperforms prior black-box methods.
Taking the position that an effective attack should have the ability to provide
confident positive inferences, we find that previous attacks do not often
provide a meaningful basis for confidently inferring membership, whereas our
attack can be effectively calibrated for high precision. Finally, we examine
popular defenses against MI attacks, finding that (1) smaller generalization
error is not sufficient to prevent attacks on real models, and (2) while
small-$\epsilon$-differential privacy reduces the attack's effectiveness, this
often comes at a significant cost to the model's accuracy; and for larger
$\epsilon$ that are sometimes used in practice (e.g., $\epsilon=16$), the
attack can achieve nearly the same accuracy as on the unprotected model.

the resetting current in the system which emerges due to the sudden relocation
of the particles to the step-like configuration and is strongly correlated to
the diffusive current. We show that the average resetting current is negative,
but its magnitude also grows linearly with time $t.$ We also compute the
probability distributions of the diffusive current, resetting current and the
total current (sum of the diffusive and the resetting currents) using the

important question arises: Are there also directly measurable or even
technologically useful physical properties characterizing nontrivial nodal loop
topology? In this work, we provide an affirmative answer by showing, for the
first time, that nodal linkages protect the higher harmonic generation (HHG) of

in the intra-band semi-classical response of nodal materials, which will be
robust against perturbations preserving the nodal topology. These
nonlinearities distort incident radiation and produce higher frequency peaks in
the teraHertz (THz) regime, as we quantitatively demonstrate for a few known

for HHG will greatly aid applications like material characterization and
non-ionizing imaging of object interiors.

to find an injection of the vertex set of a given weighted graph into a given

the end vertices of the heavier edge are closer than the end vertices of the
lighter edge. The \emph{Seriation} problem is to find a simultaneous reordering
of the rows and columns of a symmetric matrix such that the entries are
monotone nondecreasing in rows and columns when moving towards the diagonal. If
such a reordering exists, it is called a \emph{Robinson} ordering. In this
work, we establish a connection between the SCFE problem and the Seriation

adjacency matrix of $G$ has a Robinson ordering, we construct a polyhedron that
is not empty if and only if there is an injection of the vertex set of $G$ in

we conclude that deciding the existence of (and constructing) such an injection

determination, which fixes the deceleration parameter to the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model value of $q_0=-0.55$, that is, uses information from
observations beyond the local universe. First, we derive the effective
calibration prior on the absolute magnitude $M_B$ of Supernovae Ia, which can
be used in cosmological analyses in order to avoid the double counting of
low-redshift supernovae. We find $M_B = -19.2334 \pm 0.0404$ mag. Then, we use
the above $M_B$ prior in order to obtain a determination of the local $H_0$
which only uses local observations and only assumes the cosmological principle,
that is, large-scale homogeneity and isotropy. This is achieved by adopting an
uninformative flat prior for $q_0$ in the cosmographic expansion of the
luminosity distance. We use the latest Pantheon sample and find $H_0= 75.35 \pm
1.68 \text{ km s}^{-1} {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, which features a 2.2% uncertainty,
close to the 1.9% error obtained by the SH0ES Collaboration. Our determination
is at the higher tension of $4.5\sigma$ with the latest results from the Planck

constrain the deceleration parameter to $q_0= -1.08 \pm 0.29$, which disagrees

result in amplification of chemical signals contained in the cube. Perhaps most

significantly stronger in a data cube reconstructed from 10% CS sampling than
it is in the raw, 100% sampled data cube. We explore this phenomenon in two

balance between inflows and outflows, but also through the internal depletion
of gas due to star formation. At the same time, stellar feedback is the
internal engine that powers the strong outflows. Since star formation and
stellar feedback are both small scale phenomena, we need a realistic and
predictive subgrid model for both. We describe the implementation of supernova
momentum feedback and star formation based on the turbulence of the gas in the
RAMSES code. For star formation, we adopt the so-called multi-freefall model.
The resulting star formation efficiencies can be significantly smaller or
bigger than the traditionally chosen value of $1\%$. We apply these new
numerical models to a prototype cosmological simulation of a massive halo that
features a major merger which results in the formation of an early-type galaxy
without using AGN feedback. We find that the feedback model provides the first
order mechanism for regulating the stellar and baryonic content in our
simulated galaxy. At high redshift, the merger event pushes gas to large
densities and large turbulent velocity dispersions, such that efficiencies come
close to $10\%$, resulting in large SFR. We find small molecular gas depletion
time during the starburst, in perfect agreement with observations. Furthermore,
at late times, the galaxy becomes quiescent with efficiencies significantly
smaller than $1\%$, resulting in small SFR and long molecular gas depletion
time.

construct a simple model in which the Standard Model Higgs field is
non-minimally coupled to Palatini gravity and acts as the inflaton, leading to
a scale of inflation $H_* \sim 10^8\,$GeV. When the energy scale at which the
PQ symmetry breaks is much larger than the scale of inflation, we find that in
this scenario the required axion mass for which the axion constitutes all DM is
$m_0 \lesssim 0.05{\rm \,\mu eV}$ for a quartic Higgs self-coupling

on the regime where the de Sitter conformal symmetry is weakly broken. It is
well known that the leading order effective operator
$(\partial_\mu\phi\partial^\mu\phi)^2$ is universally positive as a consequence
of unitarity. In contrast, we find that the sign of the six derivative operator
$(\nabla_\mu\partial_\nu\phi)^2(\partial_\rho\phi)^2$ is positive for
intermediate heavy scalars, whereas it is negative for intermediate heavy
spinning states. Therefore, under the assumption of tree-level UV completion,
the sign can be used to probe spins of heavy particles generating the effective

large scatter in their predictions. Instead, very massive
$\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) \geq 10.8$ are underpredicted by most of the current

spatial symmetries. A broad range of TCPs have been conventionally studied by
formulating topological invariants (symmetry indicators) at invariant momenta
in the Brillouin zone, which leaves open the question of their stability in the
absence of translational invariance. In this work, we show that robust
basis-independent topological invariants can be generically constructed for
TCPs using projected symmetry operators. Remarkably we show that the real-space
topological markers of these invariants are exponentially localized to the
fixed points of the spatial symmetry. As a result, this real-space structure
protects them against the presence of impurities that are located away from the
fixed points. By considering all possible symmetry centers in a crystalline
system we can generate a mesh of real-space topological markers that can
provide a local topological distinction for TCPs. We illustrate the robustness
of this mesh of invariants with 1D and 2D TCPs protected by inversion,
rotational and mirror symmetries. Finally, we find that the boundary modes of
these TCPs can also exhibit robust topological invariants with localized
markers on the edges. We illustrate this with the gapless Majorana boundary
modes of mirror-symmetric topological superconductors, and relate their integer
topological edge invariant with a quantized effective edge polarization.

algorithmic procedure to construct the canonical generators for local Lorentz

using FPB, since the definition of form-Dirac brackets is problematic. Lorentz
generators are constructed, while diffeomorphisms are generated by the Lie

star clusters are believed to be one of the main sources of gravitational waves
for Advanced LIGO and Virgo. Here we present a fast numerical method for
simulating the evolution of star clusters with BHs, including a model for the
dynamical formation and merger of BH binaries. Our method is based on
H\'{e}non's principle of balanced evolution, according to which the flow of
energy within a cluster must be balanced by the energy production inside its
core. Because the heat production in the core is powered by the BHs, one can
then link the evolution of the cluster to the evolution of its BH population.
This allows us to construct evolutionary tracks of the cluster properties
including its BH population and its effect on the cluster and, at the same
time, determine the merger rate of BH binaries as well as their eccentricity
distributions. The model is publicly available and includes the effects of a BH
mass spectrum, mass-loss due to stellar evolution, the ejection of BHs due to
natal and dynamical kicks, and relativistic corrections during binary-single
encounters. We validate our method using direct $N$-body simulations, and find
it to be in excellent agreement with results from recent Monte Carlo models of
globular clusters. This establishes our new method as a robust tool for the
study of BH dynamics in star clusters and the modelling of gravitational wave
sources produced in these systems. Finally, we compute the rate and
eccentricity distributions of merging BH binaries for a wide range of cluster
initial conditions, spanning more than two orders of magnitude in mass and

the spin autocorrelation function from experiments with cold atoms, and the
connected spin-spin correlation function from experiments with ion traps. We
find that self-averaging holds at short times for the quantities that are local

is on the blue horizontal branch and is very old. The cluster is confined to
the bulge and bar region, but it does not support the Galactic bar structure.
The old stellar population represented by clusters like this has to be taken
into account in models of Galactic bulge formation. Studying them also provides
indications on the formation times of the globular clusters themselves.

ferromagnetic transition at $T_{\mathrm{C}}=340$(1) K and a spin-reorientation
transition at $T_{\mathrm{N}}=326$(1) K to an antiferromagnetic phase.
First-principles electronic structure calculations indicate a not-fully
polarized spin state of Mn in a $d^5$ electron configuration with $J=S=3$/2, in
agreement with the saturation magnetization of 3~$\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ in the
ordered state and the observed paramagnetic effective moment. A sizeable
anomalous Hall effect in the antiferromagnetic phase alongside the
computational study suggests that the antiferromagnetic structure is
non-collinear. Based on thermodynamic and resistivity data we construct a
magnetic phase diagram. Magnetization curves $M$($H$) at low temperatures
reveal a metamagnetic transition of spin-flop type. The spin-flopped phase
terminates at a critical point with $T_{\mathrm{cr}}\approx 300$ K and
$H_{\mathrm{cr}}\approx 10$ kOe, near which a peak of the magnetocaloric
entropy change is observed. Using Arrott plot analysis and magnetoresistivity

whereas the strong field dependence of $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ and the linear
relationship of the $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ with $M^2$ hint at its magnetoelastic

that shape the formation and evolution of planets. The Kepler mission has led
to an abundance of statistical discoveries in regards to planetary radius, but
the number of observed planets with measured masses is much smaller. By
incorporating results from recent mass determination programs, we have
discovered a new gap emerging in the planet population for sub-Neptune mass
planets with orbital periods less than 20 days. The gap follows a slope of
decreasing mass with increasing orbital period, has a width of a few
$M_\oplus$, and is potentially completely devoid of planets. Fitting gaussian
mixture models to the planet population in this region favours a bimodel
distribution over a unimodel one with a reduction in Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) of 19.9, highlighting the gap significance. We discuss several
processes which could generate such a feature in the planet distribution,
including a pileup of planets above the gap region, tidal interactions with the
host star, dynamical interactions with the disk, with other planets, or with
accreting material during the formation process.

Our aim is to examine relatively cool soft X-ray emitting gas within the
central region of these massive early-type galaxies. Such gas, referred to as a
Minicorona in previous studies is common in the core of large elliptical
cluster galaxies. It has not been completely stripped or evaporated by the
surrounding hot intracluster medium and nor fully accreted onto the central
black hole. With thermal emission from the minicorona dominating over any
power-law radiation components, we find that both NGC 1270 and NGC 1272
encompass minicoronae, the temperature and radius of which are $0.99$ keV and
$0.63$ keV; $1.4$ kpc and $1.2$ kpc respectively. For NGC 1272, the thermal
coronal component dominates the core emission by a factor of over 10. We show
that the depletion time scale of minicoronal gas via viscous stripping is
shorter by a factor of $100$ than the replenishment time scale due to stellar
mass loss. Magnetic fields are presumably responsible for suppression of the
transport processes. Finally, we show that both objects have to meet a balance
between cooling and heating as well as that among mass replenishment, stripping

hierarchical formation of structure, giving rise to dark matter (DM) halos and
subhalos. When the latter are massive enough they retain gas (i.e., baryons)
and become visible. This is the case of the dwarf satellite galaxies in the
Milky Way (MW). Below a certain mass, halos may not accumulate significant
amounts of baryons and remain completely dark. However, if DM particles are
Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), we expect them to annihilate in
subhalos, producing gamma rays which can be detected with the Fermi satellite.
Using the three most recent point-source Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)
catalogs (3FGL, 2FHL and 3FHL), we search for DM subhalo candidates among the
unidentified sources, i.e., sources with no firm association to a known
astrophysical object. We apply several selection criteria based on the expected
properties of the DM-induced emission from subhalos, which allow us to
significantly reduce the list of potential candidates. Then, by characterizing
the minimum detection flux of the instrument and comparing our sample to
predictions from the Via Lactea II (VL-II) N-body cosmological simulation, we
place conservative and robust constraints on the $\langle\sigma
v\rangle-m_{DM}$ parameter space. For annihilation via the $\tau^+\tau^-$
channel, we put an upper limit of $4\times 10^{-26}~(5\times
10^{-25})~cm^3~s^{-1}$ for a mass of 10 (100) GeV. A critical improvement over
previous treatments is the repopulation we made to include low-mass subhalos
below the VL-II mass resolution. With more advanced subhalo candidate filtering
the sensitivity reach of our method can potentially improve these constraints
by a factor 3 (2) for $\tau^+\tau^-$ ($b \bar{b}$) channel.

increase the modeling accuracy of inverse dynamics models which are typically

our work suggests that starspots for time series with and without differential
rotation have distinct dynamics, and second, the magnetic fields of active
stars are apparently governed by two mechanisms with different levels of
complexity for fluctuations. Throughout the course of the study, we identified
an overall trend whereby the differential rotation is distributed in two $H$
regimes segregated by the degree of asymmetry $A$, where $H$-index denotes the
global Hurst exponent which is used as a measure of long-term memory of time
series. As a result, we show that the degree of asymmetry can be considered a

related to the effect of the rotational modulation on the time series. In
summary, the multifractality signals in our sample are the result of magnetic
activity control mechanisms leading to activity-related long-term persistent

Analog to Digital (A/D) conversion overheads. This paper aims to address these
challenges by offering and leveraging the insight that a vector dot-product
(the basic operation in DNNs) can be bit-partitioned into groups of spatially
parallel low-bitwidth operations, and interleaved across multiple elements of
the vectors. As such, the building blocks of our accelerator become a group of
wide, yet low-bitwidth multiply-accumulate units that operate in the analog
domain and share a single A/D converter. The low-bitwidth operation tackles the
encoding range limitation and facilitates noise mitigation. Moreover, we
utilize the switched-capacitor design for our bit-level reformulation of DNN
operations. The proposed switched-capacitor circuitry performs the group
multiplications in the charge domain and accumulates the results of the group
in its capacitors over multiple cycles. The capacitive accumulation combined
with wide bit-partitioned operations alleviate the need for A/D conversion per
operation. With such mathematical reformulation and its switched-capacitor

(DBA) for the bus services at the stations, one of those disregarded
microscopic details, has a large impact on the overall BRT performance. To
evaluate the variations in the system's performance upon changes on the DBA, we
have simulated the entire operation of a simplified BRT system using a cellular
automaton microsimulation scheme. We find that the critical service frequency,
above which bus queues appear, strongly depends on the DBA at the busiest
stations in the system, leading to significant performance differences. Smaller
critical frequencies, and poorer performance, are observed as the service
demand for the services sharing a docking bay increases. By approximating the
frequency optimization problem, we show that, due to the limitations imposed to
the optimal frequencies by the critical frequency, the service frequencies that
minimize the total cost depend on the DBA at the busiest stations. This
correlation becomes stronger as the passenger demand increases and as more
importance is given to the passenger time in the total cost. Our results
suggest that the frequency optimization problem in BRT systems must include the

fields. In survey sampling, bias often occurs due to unrepresentative samples.
In causal studies with observational data, the treated versus untreated group
assignment is often correlated with covariates, i.e., not random. Empirical
calibration is a generic weighting method that presents a unified view on
correcting or reducing the data biases for the tasks mentioned above. We
provide a Python library EC to compute the empirical calibration weights. The
problem is formulated as convex optimization and solved efficiently in the dual

also accommodates different optimization objectives, supports weight clipping,

the cosmological simulation Illustris. GCs are tagged to individual galaxies at
their infall time. The tidal removal of GCs from their galaxies and the
distribution of the GCs within the cluster is later followed self-consistently
by the simulation. The method relies on the simple assumption of a single
power-law relation between halo mass (M_vir) and mass in GCs (M_GC) as found in
observations. We find that the GCs specific frequency $S_N$ as a function of
V-band magnitude naturally reproduces the observed ""U""-shape, due to the
combination of a power law M_GC-M_vir relation and the non-linear M_*-M_vir
relation from the simulation. Additional scatter in the $S_N$ values are traced
back to galaxies with early infall times due to the evolution in the M_*-M_vir
relation with redshift. GCs that have been tidally removed from their galaxies
form today the intra-cluster component from which about ~60% were brought in by
galaxies that orbit today within the cluster potential. The remaining ""orphan""
GCs are contributed by satellite galaxies with a wide range of stellar masses
that are fully tidally disrupted at z=0. This intra-cluster component is a good
dynamical tracer of the dark matter potential. As a consequence of the accreted
nature of most intra-cluster GCs, their orbits are fairly radial with a
predicted orbital anisotropy \beta >= 0.5. However, local tangential motions
may appear as a consequence of localized substructure, providing a possible
interpretation to the \beta<0 values suggested in observations of M87.

estimating the median that lead to estimators with sub-Gaussian type errors.
Unlike most existing differentially private median estimators, both algorithms
are well defined for unbounded random variables that are not even required to
have finite moments. We then turn to the problem of sub-Gaussian mean

across domains and levels of analysis. Music sampling is an ideal research
model for this process because samples are known to be culturally transmitted
between collaborating artists, and sampling events are reliably documented in
online databases. The aim of the current study was to determine whether
frequency-based bias has played a role in the cultural transmission of music

three decades. Firstly, we assessed whether turn-over rates of popular samples
differ from those expected under neutral evolution. Next, we used agent-based

would further enable their use in tools that help providers and care managers.
However, as in the most NLP tasks on clinical text, creating gold standard to
train and test NLP models is tedious and expensive. Fortuitously, sometimes but
not always clinical notes contain sections with a heading that identifies the
section as a plan. Leveraging contents of such labeled sections as a noisy
training data, we assessed accuracy of NLP models trained with the data.
  Methods: We used common variations of plan headings and rule-based heuristics
to find plan sections with headings in clinical notes, and we extracted
sentences from them and formed a noisy training data of plan sentences. We
trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
models with the data. We measured accuracy of the trained models on the noisy
dataset using ten-fold cross validation and separately on a set-aside manually
annotated dataset.
  Results: About 13% of 117,730 clinical notes contained treatment plans
sections with recognizable headings in the 1001 longitudinal patient records
that were obtained from Cleveland Clinic under an IRB approval. We were able to
extract and create a noisy training data of 13,492 plan sentences from the
clinical notes. CNN achieved best F measures, 0.91 and 0.97 in the
cross-validation and set-aside evaluation experiments respectively. SVM
slightly underperformed with F measures of 0.89 and 0.96 in the same

  Conclusion: Our study showed that the training supervised learning models

good source for generating effective training data.

research, administrative actions (community bans and quarantines) are often
taken in reaction to media pressure following offensive discourse within a
community spilling into the real world with serious consequences. In this
paper, we investigate the feasibility of proactive moderation on Reddit --
i.e., proactively identifying communities at risk of committing offenses that
previously resulted in bans for other communities. Proactive moderation
strategies show promise for two reasons: (1) they have potential to narrow down
the communities that administrators need to monitor for hateful content and (2)
they give administrators a scientific rationale to back their administrative
decisions and interventions. Our work shows that communities are constantly
evolving in their user base and topics of discourse and that evolution into
hateful or dangerous (i.e., considered bannable by Reddit administrators)
communities can often be predicted months ahead of time. This makes proactive
moderation feasible. Further, we leverage explainable machine learning to help
identify the strongest predictors of evolution into dangerous communities. This
provides administrators with insights into the characteristics of communities
at risk becoming dangerous or hateful. Finally, we investigate, at scale, the
impact of participation in hateful and dangerous subreddits and the

small-scale study of self-supervised methods on two visual environments: Flappy
Bird and Sonic The Hedgehog. In particular, we quantitatively evaluate the
representations learned from these tasks in two contexts: a) the extent to
which the representations capture true state information of the agent and b)
how generalizable these representations are to novel situations, like new

visualizing which parts of the environment they focus on. Our results show that
the utility of the representations is highly dependent on the visuals and

promise as potential qubits, partly because of their weak and anisotropic
hyperfine couplings to proximal nuclear spins. Since the hyperfine coupling is
weak, it can be difficult to measure. However, an anisotropic hyperfine
coupling can give rise to a substantial spin-echo envelope modulation that can
be Fourier-analyzed to accurately reveal the hyperfine tensor. Here, we give a
general theoretical analysis for hole-spin-echo envelope modulation (HSEEM),
and apply this analysis to the specific case of a boron-acceptor hole spin in
silicon. For boron acceptor spins in unstrained silicon, both the hyperfine and
Zeeman Hamiltonians are approximately isotropic leading to negligible envelope
modulations. In contrast, in strained silicon, where light-hole spin qubits can
be energetically isolated, we find the hyperfine Hamiltonian and $g$-tensor are
sufficiently anisotropic to give spin-echo-envelope modulations. We show that
there is an optimal magnetic-field orientation that maximizes the visibility of
envelope modulations in this case. Based on microscopic estimates of the
hyperfine coupling, we find that the maximum modulation depth can be
substantial, reaching $\sim 10\%$, at a moderate laboratory magnetic field,
$B\lesssim 200\,\mathrm{mT}$.

reached are: 1) The orbit of the secondary star of the eclipsing Component A
(V1016 Ori) is highly inclined with respect to the equatorial plane of its
primary star. 2) The also eclipsing binary BM Ori (Trapezium Component B) does
have a tertiary member with period about 3.5 years, as proposed by Vitrichenko
& Klochkova (2004), and is the same as the companion recently found by the
GRAVITY collaboration et al. (2018}. 3) Component D is indeed a spectroscopic
and interferometric double star with a relatively high-mass companion
($q=M_2/M_1=0.5$) and period $52.90\pm0.05\,d$. 4) Component F, is a CP star
(B7.5 p Si); its radial velocity, $23.2\pm4.2\,km\,s^{-1}$, is smaller than
that of all other Trapezium members and, possibly, the evolutionary stage of
the star is more advanced than that of members with similar mass. Consequently,
Component F is probably not physically related to the Trapezium. Several
evidences point to the extreme youth of this stellar group; its further study,
most likely, will shed light on the formation processes of massive stars.

introduced. To address the non-deterministic nature of the shape completion
problem, we leverage a weighted multi-target probabilistic solution which is an
extension to the conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). This approach
considers multiple targets as acceptable reconstructions, each weighted
according to their conformity with the original shape. We quantify the
performance gain of the proposed method against similar algorithms, including
CVAE, where we report statistically significant improvements in both
deterministic and probabilistic paradigms. The probabilistic model is also
evaluated on its ability to generate anatomically relevant variations for the
missing bone. As a unique aspect of this work, the model is tested on real
surgical cases where the clinical relevancy of its reconstructions and their
compliance with surgeon's virtual plan are demonstrated as necessary steps
towards clinical adoption.

that were generated when subjects may be happy, upset, or stressed. Thus, there
is no indication that mood negatively impacts performance. However, we do find
that changes existing in smartphone usage patterns may correlate with mood,
including changes in locking, audio, location, calling, homescreen, and e-mail

In this paper, we present Multivariate Big Data Analysis (MBDA), a complete

art machine learning methodologies applied to the intrusion detection problem,
when an anomaly is identified in MBDA the output of the system includes the
detail of the logs of raw information associated to this anomaly, so that the
security team can use this information to elucidate its root causes. MBDA is
based in two open software packages available in Github: the MEDA Toolbox and
the FCParser. We illustrate our approach with two case studies. The first one
demonstrates the application of MBDA to semistructured sources of information,
using the data from the VAST 2012 mini challenge 2. This complete case study is

the soluble form of B cell receptors (BCRs), that bind to and neutralize
invading pathogens. The natural development of BCRs must be understood in order
to design vaccines for highly mutable pathogens such as influenza and HIV. BCR
diversity is induced by naturally occurring combinatorial ""V(D)J""
rearrangement, mutation, and selection processes. Most current methods for BCR
sequence analysis focus on separately modeling the above processes. Statistical
phylogenetic methods are often used to model the mutational dynamics of BCR
sequence data, but these techniques do not consider all the complexities
associated with B cell diversification such as the V(D)J rearrangement process.
In particular, standard phylogenetic approaches assume the DNA bases of the
progenitor (or ""naive"") sequence arise independently and according to the same
distribution, ignoring the complexities of V(D)J rearrangement. In this paper,
we introduce a novel approach to Bayesian phylogenetic inference for BCR
sequences that is based on a phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM). This
technique not only integrates a naive rearrangement model with a phylogenetic
model for BCR sequence evolution but also naturally accounts for uncertainty in
all unobserved variables, including the phylogenetic tree, via posterior
distribution sampling.

quantum devices as high-fidelity transmitters of spin information. Recent
theoretical studies suggest that the strong Coulomb interactions in Mott

device constraints experimental realization has proven difficult. In this work
we use scanning tunneling microscopy at liquid helium temperatures to directly

density wave domain walls in TaS$_2$ create band bending and provide ideal
conditions of low densities and strong interactions in 1D. STM spectroscopic
maps show that once the lower Hubbard band crosses the Fermi energy, the
charges rearrange to minimize Coulomb energy, forming zigzag patterns expected

signatures signifying charge or spin fluctuations induced by the tunneling
electrons, which is expected for this more fragile condensed state. The
observation of a Wigner crystal at orders of magnitude higher temperatures

cavity linewidth may arise in tunable and nonlinear microwave cavities, and how
these fluctuations affect the measurement of scattering matrix elements.
Applying this model to the specific case of a two-sided cavity, we obtain
closed-form expressions for the average scattering matrix elements in several
important cases. A key signature of our model is the subtle deformation of the
trajectories swept out by scattering matrix elements in the complex plane.
Despite this signature, the fluctuating and non-fluctuating models are
qualitatively similar enough to be mistaken for one another. In the case of
tunable cavities we show that if one fails to account for these fluctuations
then one will find damping rates that appear to depend on the tuning parameter,
which is a common observation in such systems. In the case of a Kerr cavity, we
show that there exists a fundamental lower bound to the scale of these
frequency fluctuations in the steady state, imposed by quantum mechanical
uncertainty, which can appreciably affect the apparent damping rates of the
cavity as the strength of the nonlinearity approaches the single-photon level.
By using the model we present as a fitting function for experimental data,
however, one can extract both the true damping rates of the cavity and the
effective scale of these frequency fluctuations over the scattering
measurement's bandwidth. Lastly, we compare this new method for observing

and, in geologically-active bodies, plate tectonics. At pressures within the
interior of many planets, the H-bonds in H2O collapse into stronger, ionic
bonds. Here we present agreement between X-ray diffraction and Raman
spectroscopy for the transition from ice-VII to ice-X occurring at a pressure
of approximately 30.9 GPa by means of combining grain normalizing heat
treatment via direct laser heating with static compression. This is evidenced
by the emergence of the characteristic Raman mode of cuprite-like ice-X and an
abrupt 2.5-fold increase in bulk modulus, implying a significant increase in
bond strength. This is preceded by a transition from cubic ice-VII to a
structure of tetragonal symmetry, ice-VIIt at 5.1 GPa. Our results
significantly shift the mass/radius relationship of water-rich planets and
define a high-pressure limit for release of chemically-bound water within the

performance thanks to recent advances in camera technology and vision-based
techniques. However, there remains one critical caveat: all current approaches
that are based on image retrieval currently scale at best linearly with the
size of the environment with respect to both storage, and consequentially in
most approaches, query time. This limitation severely curtails the capability
of autonomous systems in a wide range of compute, power, storage, size, weight
or cost constrained applications such as drones. In this work, we present a
novel binary tree encoding approach for visual localization which can serve as
an alternative for existing quantization and indexing techniques. The proposed
tree structure allows us to derive a compressed training scheme that achieves
sub-linearity in both required storage and inference time. The encoding memory
can be easily configured to satisfy different storage constraints. Moreover,
our approach is amenable to an optional sequence filtering mechanism to further
improve the localization results, while maintaining the same amount of storage.
Our system is entirely agnostic to the front-end descriptors, allowing it to be
used on top of recent state-of-the-art image representations. Experimental
results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches under limited storage constraints.

(SecGD), a method for training machine learning models on data that is spread
over different clients while preserving the privacy of the training data. We
achieve this by letting each client add temporary noise to the information they
send to the server during the training process. They also share this noise in
separate messages with the server, which can then subtract it from the
previously received values. By routing all data through an anonymization
network such as Tor, we prevent the server from knowing which messages
originate from the same client, which in turn allows us to show that breaking a
client's privacy is computationally intractable as it would require solving a
hard instance of the subset sum problem. This setup allows SecGD to work in the
presence of only two honest clients and a malicious server, and without the
need for peer-to-peer connections.

data-mining applications such as in E-commerce recommendation systems. Since
learning in graph space is more complicated than in Euclidian space, recent
studies have extensively utilized neural nets to effectively and efficiently
embed a graph's nodes into a multidimensional space. However, this embedding
method has not yet been applied to large-scale bipartite graphs. Existing
techniques either cannot be scaled to large-scale bipartite graphs that have
limited labels or cannot exploit the unique structure of bipartite graphs,
which have distinct node features in two domains. Thus, we propose Cascade
Bipartite Graph Neural Networks, Cascade-BGNN, a novel node representation
learning for bipartite graphs that is domain-consistent, self-supervised, and
efficient. To efficiently aggregate information both across and within the two
partitions of a bipartite graph, BGNN utilizes a customized Inter-domain
Message Passing (IDMP) and Intra-domain Alignment (IDA), which is our
adaptation of adversarial learning, for message aggregation across and within
partitions, respectively. BGNN is trained in a self-supervised manner.
Moreover, we formulate a multi-layer BGNN in a cascaded training manner to
enable multi-hop relationship modeling while improving training efficiency.
Extensive experiments on several datasets of varying scales verify the
effectiveness and efficiency of BGNN over baselines. Our design is further
affirmed through theoretical analysis for domain alignment. The scalability of
BGNN is additionally verified through its demonstrated rapid training speed and
low memory cost over a large-scale real-world bipartite graph.

the anti-aliased effect is splicing multiple triangles at varying scale levels
to approximate the fan-shaped line joins. However, this approximation
inevitably produces some unreality, and the system rendering performance is not
optimal. To circumvent these drawbacks, in this paper, we propose a simple but
efficient algorithm which uses only two triangles to substitute the multiple
triangles approximation and then renders a realistic fan-shaped curve with
alpha operation based on geometrical relation computing. Our experiment shows
it has advantages of a realistic anti-aliasing effect, less memory cost, higher
frame rate, and drawing line joins without overlapping rendering. Our proposed

death registration systems, meaning that most deaths are not recorded and
critical quantities like life expectancy cannot be directly measured. The
sibling survival method is a leading approach to estimating adult mortality in
the absence of death registration. The idea is to ask a survey respondent to
enumerate her siblings and to report about their survival status. In many
countries and time periods, sibling survival data are the only
nationally-representative source of information about adult mortality. Although
a huge amount of sibling survival data has been collected, important
methodological questions about the method remain unresolved. To help make
progress on this issue, we propose re-framing the sibling survival method as a
network sampling problem. This approach enables us to formally derive
statistical estimators for sibling survival data. Our derivation clarifies the
precise conditions that sibling history estimates rely upon; it leads to
internal consistency checks that can help assess data and reporting quality;
and it reveals important quantities that could potentially be measured to relax

heterogeneity associated with variations of individual task roles, affects
social contacts, and thus the way in which agent moves through social contact
networks. We used an Agent Based Model (ABM) to mimic three realistic scenarios

individuals within a specific task interact more with consequences that agent
could potentially spread rapidly within that group, while agent spreads slower
between task groups. Our simulations show a strong linear relationship between
the degree of spatial heterogeneity and social contact rates, and that the
spreading dynamics of agents follow a modified nonlinear logistic growth model

important insights on the dual-functionality of physical contacts. This
dual-functionality is often driven via variations of individual spatial
behavior, and can have both inhibiting and facilitating effects on agent

explain the existence of neutrino masses and dark matter simultaneously.
However, since triplet fermions have SU(2) gauge interaction, they cannot be
out of equilibrium before the electroweak symmetry breaking. Thus, leptogenesis
seems to be difficult within a framework of the pure type III seesaw model.
Some extension seems to be required to solve this fault. A model extended by
introducing a singlet fermion could be such a simple example. If the singlet
fermion is in the thermal equilibrium even for its extremely small neutrino
Yukawa coupling, leptogenesis could be shown to occur successfully for a rather
low mass of the singlet fermion. The required mass could be lowered to
$10^4$~GeV.

on-resonance Rabi oscillation and in the meanwhile the other one still stays
approximately in the ground state, under the conditions that the two
enantiomers are governed by the effective on-resonance and large-detuning

inner-state enantio-separation can be obtained when the probabilities occupying
the ground states of the two enantiomers simultaneously experience half-integer

more efficient than the conventional one, utilizing the dephasing rate of
ground-state coherence, i.e., the decoherence rate to produce entanglement or
two-mode squeezing which adds far more excess fluctuation or noise to the

two-photon detuning, showing our scheme is robust and flexible. It is also
interesting to note that while EIT is the effect in the perturbation limit,
i.e. the probe field being much weaker than the coupling field and treated as a
perturbation, there exists an optimum ratio of the probe to coupling
intensities to achieve the maximum entanglement. Our proposed scheme can
advance the continuous-variable-based quantum technology and may lead to

years. However, crawled web images usually have two types of noises, label
noise and background noise, which induce extra difficulties in utilizing them
effectively. Most existing methods either rely on human supervision or ignore
the background noise. In this paper, we propose a novel method, which is
capable of handling these two types of noises together, without the supervision
of clean images in the training stage. Particularly, we formulate our method
under the framework of multi-instance learning by grouping ROIs (i.e., images
and their region proposals) from the same category into bags. ROIs in each bag
are assigned with different weights based on the representative/discriminative
scores of their nearest clusters, in which the clusters and their scores are
obtained via our designed memory module. Our memory module could be naturally
integrated with the classification module, leading to an end-to-end trainable
system. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

computer security domain. On the one hand, malicious parties may recover
interpretable source codes from the software products to gain commercial
advantages. On the other hand, binary decompilation can be leveraged for code
vulnerability analysis and malware detection. However, efficient binary
decompilation is challenging. Conventional decompilers have the following major
limitations: (i) they are only applicable to specific source-target language
pair, hence incurs undesired development cost for new language tasks; (ii)
their output high-level code cannot effectively preserve the correct
functionality of the input binary; (iii) their output program does not capture
the semantics of the input and the reversed program is hard to interpret. To
address the above problems, we propose Coda, the first end-to-end neural-based
framework for code decompilation. Coda decomposes the decompilation task into
two key phases: First, Coda employs an instruction type-aware encoder and a
tree decoder for generating an abstract syntax tree (AST) with attention
feeding during the code sketch generation stage. Second, Coda then updates the
code sketch using an iterative error correction machine guided by an ensembled
neural error predictor. By finding a good approximate candidate and then fixing
it towards perfect, Coda achieves superior performance compared to baseline
approaches. We assess Coda's performance with extensive experiments on various
benchmarks. Evaluation results show that Coda achieves an average of 82\%
program recovery accuracy on unseen binary samples, where the state-of-the-art
decompilers yield 0\% accuracy. Furthermore, Coda outperforms the
sequence-to-sequence model with attention by a margin of 70\% program accuracy.

since the invention of statistical mechanics, which establishes the connection
between dynamics of many-body Hamiltonian systems and phenomenological
thermodynamics. The key link in this connection is stochasticity, which
translates the deterministic evolution of a dynamical system to its
probabilistic exploration of the state space. To-date research focuses on
determining the conditions of stochasticity for particular systems. Here we
propose an alternative agenda and prove thermalization for non-stochastic
Hamiltonian systems. This shows that thermalization happens in both stochastic
and non-stochastic systems, reducing the need to rely on stochasticity in a
""coarse-grained"" analysis. The result is valid for an arbitrary classical
Hamiltonian system and does not rely on the thermodynamic limit or the
particular form of the interaction potential. It utilizes the property of
adiabatic invariance, and reveals a deep relation between the structure of the
microscopic Hamiltonian and macroscopic thermodynamics.

classical supergravity. There is a leg amputation procedure, which constructs a
solution of the Maurer-Cartan equation from tree diagramms of SUGRA. We
consider a particular example of the beta-deformation. It is known that the
leading term of the beta-function is cubic in the parameter of the
beta-deformation. We give a cohomological interpretation of this leading term.
We conjecture that it is actually encoded in some simpler cohomology class,
which is quadratic in the parameter of the beta-deformation.

distributed parallel training becomes an important and successful technique to

a computation and communication decoupled stochastic gradient descent
(CoCoD-SGD) algorithm to run computation and communication in parallel to
reduce the communication cost. We prove that CoCoD-SGD has a linear iteration
speedup with respect to the total computation capability of the hardware

speedup comparing with traditional distributed SGD algorithms. Experiments on
deep neural network training demonstrate the significant improvements of

CoCoD-SGD is up to 2-3$\times$ faster than traditional synchronous SGD.

Similarly to Kim et al. [27], we find that only two locally stable equilibria
exist: one corresponding to great ape-like longevities and the other
corresponding to hunter-gatherer longevities. Our results show that
grandmothering enables the transition between these two equilibria, without
extending the end of fertility. Moreover, sensitivity analyses of the model
show that male competition, arising from a skew in the mating sex ratio towards
males, plays a significant role in determining whether the transition from
great ape-like longevities to higher longevities is possible and the
equilibrium value of the average adult lifespan. Whereas grandmothering effects
have a significant impact on the equilibrium value of the average age at last
birth and enable the transition to higher longevities, they have an
insignificant impact on the equilibrium value of the average adult lifespan.

before the age of forty and rarely outlive their fertile years. In contrast,
women - even in high mortality hunter-gatherer populations - usually remain
healthy and productive well beyond menopause. The grandmother hypothesis aims
to account for the evolution of this distinctive feature of human life history.
Our previous mathematical simulations of that hypothesis fixed the end of
female fertility at the age of 45, based on the similarities among living
hominids, and then modeled the evolution of human-like longevity from an
ancestral state, like that of the great apes, due only to grandmother effects.
A major modification here allows the age female fertility ends to vary as well,
directly addressing a version of the question, influentially posed by GC
Williams six decades ago: Why isn't menopause later in humans? Our model is an
agent-based model (ABM) that accounts for the coevolution of both expected
adult lifespan and end of female fertility as selection maximizes reproductive
value. We find that grandmother effects not only drive the population from an
equilibrium representing a great ape-like longevity to a new human-like
longevity, they also maintain the observed termination of women's fertility
before the age of 50.

revolutionize many biomedical technologies, such as minimally-invasive

However, many of these applications will require the controlled dynamics of
teams of these micro-robots with minimal feedback. In this work, we study the
motion and fluid dynamics produced by groups of artificial microswimmers driven
by a torque induced through a uniform, rotating magnetic field. Through
Stokesian dynamics simulations, we show that the swimmer motion produces a
rotational velocity field in the plane orthogonal to the direction of the
magnetic field's rotation, which causes two interacting swimmers to move in
circular trajectories in this plane around a common center. The resulting over
all motion is on a helical trajectory for the swimmers. We compare the highly
rotational velocity field of the fluid to the velocity field generated by a
rotlet, the point-torque singularity of Stokes flows, showing that this is a
reasonable approximation on the time average. Finally, we study the motion of
larger groups of swimmers and show that these groups tend to move coherently,
especially when swimmer magnetizations are uniform. This coherence is achieved
because the group center remains almost constant in the plane orthogonal to the
net motion of the swimmers. The results in the paper will prove useful for
controlling the ensemble dynamics of small collections of magnetic swimmers.

by the number of fertile females in a population. We build an ODE model with
minimal age structure, in which males compete for paternities using either a
multiple-mating or searching-then-guarding strategy, to investigate the value
of ASR as an index for predicting which strategy males will adopt, with a focus
in our investigation on the differences of strategy choice between chimpanzees
Pan troglodytes and human hunter-gatherers Homo sapiens. Parameters in the
model characterise aspects of life history and behaviour, and determine both
dominant strategy and the ASR when the population is at or near equilibrium.
Sensitivity analysis on the model parameters informs us that ASR is strongly
influenced by parameters characterising life history, while dominant strategy
is affected most strongly by the effectiveness of guarding (average length of
time a guarded pair persists, and resistance to paternity theft) and moderately
by some life history traits. For fixed effectiveness of guarding and other
parameters, dominant strategy tends to change from multiple mating to guarding
along a curve that aligns well with a contour of constant ASR, under variation
of parameters such as longevity and age female fertility ends. This confirms
the hypothesis that ASR may be a useful index for predicting the optimal male
mating strategy, provided we have some limited information about ecology and
behaviour.

To appear in Finite Fields and Their Applications",,,,"math.CO math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we generalize the notion of functional graph. Specifically,
given an equation $E(X,Y) = 0$ with variables $X$ and $Y$ over a finite field
$\mathbb{F}_q$ of odd characteristic, we define a digraph by choosing the
elements in $\mathbb{F}_q$ as vertices and drawing an edge from $x$ to $y$ if
and only if $E(x,y)=0$. We call this graph as equational graph. In this paper,
we study the equational graphs when choosing $E(X,Y) = (Y^2 - f(X))(\lambda Y^2
- f(X))$ with $f(X)$ a polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $\lambda$ a
non-square element in $\mathbb{F}_q$. We show that if $f$ is a permutation
polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_q$, then every connected component of the graph has
a Hamiltonian cycle. Moreover, these Hamiltonian cycles can be used to
construct balancing binary sequences. By making computations for permutation
polynomials $f$ of low degree, it appears that almost all these graphs are
strongly connected, and there are many Hamiltonian cycles in such a graph if it
is connected.

by Dyson parameter $\beta$ and Laguerre parameter $a$, is fundamental in
multivariate statistics and finds applications in diverse areas. Based on a
generalization of the Selberg integral, we provide an effective recursion
scheme to compute this distribution explicitly in both the original model, and
a fixed-trace variant, for $a,\beta$ non-negative integers and finite matrix
size. For $\beta = 2$ this circumvents known symbolic evaluation based on
determinants which become impractical for large dimensions. Our exact results
have immediate applications in the areas of multiple channel communication and
bipartite entanglement. Moreover, we are also led to the exact solution of a
long standing problem of finding a general result for Landauer conductance
distribution in a chaotic mesoscopic cavity with two ideal leads. Thus far,
exact closed-form results for this were available only in the Fourier-Laplace
space or could be obtained on a case-by-case basis.

the metric reconstruction of a camera pair. We assume unknown and different
focal lengths but otherwise known internal camera parameters and a known
projective reconstruction of the camera pair. We recover two possible camera
configurations in space and use the Cheirality condition, that all 3D scene
points are in front of both cameras, to disambiguate the solution. We show in
two Theorems, first that the two solutions are in mirror positions and then the
relations between their viewing directions. Our new method performs on par
(median rotation error $\Delta R = 3.49^{\circ}$) with the standard approach of
Kruppa equations ($\Delta R = 3.77^{\circ}$) for self-calibration and 5-Point
algorithm for calibrated metric reconstruction of a camera pair. We reject
erroneous image correspondences by introducing a method to examine whether
point correspondences appear in the same order along $x, y$ image axes in image
pairs. We evaluate this method by its precision and recall and show that it
improves the robustness of point matches in architectural and general scenes.
Finally, we integrate all the introduced methods to a 3D reconstruction
pipeline. We utilize the numerous camera pair metric recontructions using
rotation-averaging algorithms and a novel method to average focal length
estimates.

non-communicating warden nodes (WNs) are randomly distributed in a square of
unit area. Each legitimate source wants to communicate with its intended
destination node while ensuring that every WN is unable to detect the presence
of the communication. In this scenario, we study the throughput scaling law.
Due the covert communication constraint, the transmit powers are necessarily
limited. Under this condition, we introduce a preservation region around each
WN. This region serves to prevent transmission from the LNs and to increase the
transmit power of the LNs outside the preservation regions. For the
achievability results, multi-hop (MH), hierarchical cooperation (HC), and
hybrid HC-MH schemes are utilized with some appropriate modifications. In the
proposed MH and hybrid schemes, because the preservation regions may impede
communication along direct data paths, the data paths are suitably modified by
taking a detour around each preservation region. To avoid the concentration of
detours resulting extra relaying burdens, we distribute the detours evenly over
a wide region. In the proposed HC scheme, we control the symbol power and the
scheduling of distributed multiple-input multiple-output transmission. We also
present matching upper bounds on the throughput scaling under the assumption
that every active LN consumes the same average transmit power over the time
period in which the WNs observe the channel outputs.

active regions give rise to a flare. Therefore, the challenge of solar flare
prediction benefits by an intelligent computational analysis of physics-based
properties extracted from active region observables, most commonly
line-of-sight or vector magnetograms of the active-region photosphere. For the
purpose of flare forecasting, this study utilizes an unprecedented 171
flare-predictive active region properties, mainly inferred by the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI) in the
course of the European Union Horizon 2020 FLARECAST project. Using two
different supervised machine learning methods that allow feature ranking as a
function of predictive capability, we show that: i) an objective training and
testing process is paramount for the performance of every supervised machine
learning method; ii) most properties include overlapping information and are
therefore highly redundant for flare prediction; iii) solar flare prediction is
still - and will likely remain - a predominantly probabilistic challenge.

applications. Transactional access to these storage systems is an important
abstraction allowing application programmers to consider blocks of actions
(i.e., transactions) as executing atomically. For performance reasons, the
consistency models implemented by modern databases are weaker than the standard
serializability model, which corresponds to the atomicity abstraction of
transactions executing over a sequentially consistent memory. Causal
consistency for instance is one such model that is widely used in practice.
  In this paper, we investigate application-specific relationships between
several variations of causal consistency and we address the issue of verifying
automatically if a given transactional program is robust against causal
consistency, i.e., all its behaviors when executed over an arbitrary causally
consistent database are serializable. We show that programs without write-write
races have the same set of behaviors under all these variations, and we show
that checking robustness is polynomial time reducible to a state reachability
problem in transactional programs over a sequentially consistent shared memory.
A surprising corollary of the latter result is that causal consistency
variations which admit incomparable sets of behaviors admit comparable sets of
robust programs. This reduction also opens the door to leveraging existing
methods and tools for the verification of concurrent programs (assuming
sequential consistency) for reasoning about programs running over causally
consistent databases. Furthermore, it allows to establish that the problem of
checking robustness is decidable when the programs executed at different sites
are finite-state.

When duplicate observations are obtained, their average typically serves as an
estimate of the true value. On the other hand, the ""best of three"" method
involves taking three measurements and using the average of the two closest
ones as estimate of the true value.
  In this paper, we consider another method which potentially involves three
measurements. Initially two measurements are obtained and if their difference
is sufficiently small, their average is taken as estimate of the true value.
However, if the difference is too large then a third independent measurement is
obtained. The estimator is then defined as the average between the third
observation and the one among the first two which is closest to it.
  Our focus in the paper is the conditional distribution of the estimate in
cases where the initial difference is too large. We find that the conditional

finite. Thus, deviation of the estimated single photon yield and single photon
error rate from their respective true values due to finite sample size can
seriously lower the provably secure key rate $R$. Current method to obtain a
lower bound of $R$ follows an indirect path by first bounding the yields and
error rates both conditioned on the type of decoy used. These bounds are then
used to deduce the single photon yield and error rate, which in turn are used
to calculate a lower bound of the key rate $R$. Here we report an improved
version of McDiarmid inequality in statistics and show how use it to directly
compute a lower bound of $R$ via the so-called centering sequence. A novelty in
this work is the optimization of the bound through the freedom of choosing
possible centering sequences. The provably secure key rate of realistic 100~km
long quantum channel obtained by our method is at least twice that of the
state-of-the-art procedure when the raw key length $\ell_\text{raw}$ is
$\approx 10^5$ to $10^6$. In fact, our method can improve the key rate
significantly over a wide range of raw key length from about $10^5$ to
$10^{11}$. More importantly, it is achieved by pure theoretical analysis
without altering the experimental setup or the post-processing method. In a

been done before the initiation of RT course, using population-wide estimates
for patients' response to therapy. However, recent technological advancements
have enabled monitoring individual patient response during the RT course, in
the form of biomarkers. Although biomarker data remains subject to substantial
uncertainties, information extracted from this data may allow the RT plan to be
adapted in a biologically informative way. We present a mathematical framework
that optimally adapts the treatment-length of an RT plan based on the acquired
mid-treatment biomarker information, while accounting for the inexact nature of
this information. We formulate the adaptive treatment-length optimization
problem as a 2-stage problem, wherein the information about the model
parameters gathered during the first stage influences the decisions in the
second stage. Using Adjustable Robust Optimization (ARO) techniques we derive
explicit optimal decision rules for the stage-2 decisions and solve the
optimization problem. The problem allows for multiple worst-case optimal
solutions. To discriminate between these, we introduce the concept of Pareto
Adjustable Robustly Optimal (PARO) solutions. In numerical experiments using
lung cancer patient data, the ARO method is benchmarked against several other
static and adaptive methods. In case of exact biomarker information, there is
sufficient space to adapt, and numerical results show that taking into account
both robustness and adaptability is not necessary. In case of inexact biomarker
information, accounting for adaptability and inexactness of biomarker
information is particularly beneficial when robustness (w.r.t. organ-at-risk
(OAR) constraint violations) is of high importance. If minor OAR violations are
allowed, a nominal folding horizon approach is a good performing alternative.

lensless method for 3D-resolved, nanoscale strain imaging in micro-crystals. A
challenge, particularly for new users of the technique, is accurate mapping of
experimental data, collected in the detector reciprocal space coordinate frame,
to more convenient orthogonal coordinates, e.g. attached to the sample. This is
particularly the case since different coordinate conventions are used at every
BCDI beamline. The reconstruction algorithms and mapping scripts composed for
individual beamlines are not readily interchangeable. To overcome this, a BCDI
experiment simulation with a plugin script that converts all beamline angles to
a universal, right-handed coordinate frame is introduced, making it possible to
condense any beamline geometry into three rotation matrices. The simulation
translates a user-specified 3D complex object to different BCDI-related
coordinate frames. It also allows the generation of synthetic coherent
diffraction data that can be inserted into any BCDI reconstruction algorithm to
reconstruct the original user-specified object. Scripts are provided to map
from sample space to detector conjugated space, detector conjugated space to
sample space and detector conjugated space to detector conjugated space for a
different reflection. This provides the reader with the basis for a flexible
simulation tool kit that is easily adapted to different geometries. It is
anticipated that this will find use in the generation of tailor-made supports
for phasing of challenging data and exploration of novel geometries or data

to a misestimation of the noise distribution. Repeated acquisitions of in vivo

noise level of constant order, we show that an existing inverse-probability
weighted (IPW) estimator of the leading principal components can (nearly)
attain the minimax optimal rate of convergence. However, deeper investigation
reveals both that, particularly in more realistic settings where the
missingness mechanism is heterogeneous, the empirical performance of the IPW
estimator can be unsatisfactory, and moreover that, in the noiseless case, it
fails to provide exact recovery of the principal components. Our main
contribution, then, is to introduce a new method for high-dimensional PCA,
called `primePCA', that is designed to cope with situations where observations
may be missing in a heterogeneous manner. Starting from the IPW estimator,
primePCA iteratively projects the observed entries of the data matrix onto the
column space of our current estimate to impute the missing entries, and then
updates our estimate by computing the leading right singular space of the
imputed data matrix. It turns out that the interaction between the
heterogeneity of missingness and the low-dimensional structure is crucial in
determining the feasibility of the problem. We therefore introduce an
incoherence condition on the principal components and prove that in the
noiseless case, the error of primePCA converges to zero at a geometric rate
when the signal strength is not too small. An important feature of our
theoretical guarantees is that they depend on average, as opposed to
worst-case, properties of the missingness mechanism. Our numerical studies on
both simulated and real data reveal that primePCA exhibits very encouraging
performance across a wide range of scenarios.

  Automata","Accepted to FORMATS 2019",,,,"cs.FL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Monitoring of a signal plays an essential role in the runtime verification of
cyber-physical systems. Qualitative timed pattern matching is one of the
mathematical formulations of monitoring, which gives a Boolean verdict for each
sub-signal according to the satisfaction of the given specification. There are
two orthogonal directions of extension of the qualitative timed pattern
matching. One direction on the result is quantitative: what engineers want is
often not a qualitative verdict but the quantitative measurement of the
satisfaction of the specification. The other direction on the algorithm is
online checking: the monitor returns some verdicts before obtaining the entire
signal, which enables to monitor a running system. It is desired from
application viewpoints. In this paper, we conduct these two extensions, taking
an automata-based approach. This is the first quantitative and online timed
pattern matching algorithm to the best of our knowledge. More specifically, we
employ what we call timed symbolic weighted automata to specify quantitative
specifications to be monitored, and we obtain an online algorithm using the
shortest distance of a weighted variant of the zone graph and dynamic
programming. Moreover, our problem setting is semiring-based and therefore,
general. Our experimental results confirm the scalability of our algorithm for
specifications with a time-bound.

bounding the optimal value of a constrained variational problem in which the

that their optimal values coincide, when the range and gradients of admissible

variational problems with polynomial data, the optimal values of each convex

finite-dimensional semidefinite programs (SDPs). These are strongly dual under

describing the evolution of relativistic runaway electrons and their
interaction with the background plasma is presented. The overall aim of the
model is to self-consistently describe the nonlinear coupled evolution of
runaway electrons (REs) and plasma instabilities during disruptions. In this
model, the runaway electrons are considered as a separate fluid species in
which the initial seed is generated through the Dreicer source, which
eventually grows by the avalanche mechanism (further relevant source mechanisms
can easily be added). Advection of the runaway electrons is considered
primarily along field lines, but also taking into account the ExB drift. The
model is implemented in the nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code JOREK
based on Bezier finite elements, with current coupling to the thermal plasma.
Benchmarking of the code with the one-dimensional runaway electron code GO is
done using an artificial thermal quench on a circular plasma. As a first
demonstration, the code is applied to the problem of an axisymmetric cold
vertical displacement event in an ITER plasma, revealing significantly
different dynamics between cases computed with and without runaway electrons.
Though it is not yet feasible to achieve fully realistic runaway electron
velocities close to the speed of light in complete simulations of slowly
evolving plasma instabilities, the code is demonstrated to be suitable to study
various kinds of MHD-RE interactions in MHD-active and disruption relevant
plasmas.

  Blockchains",,,,,"cs.CR cs.DC cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Full nodes, which synchronize the entire blockchain history and independently
validate all the blocks, form the backbone of any blockchain network by playing
a vital role in ensuring security properties. On the other hand, a user running
a full node needs to pay a heavy price in terms of storage costs. E.g., the
Bitcoin blockchain size has grown over 215GB, in spite of its low throughput.
The ledger size for a high throughput blockchain Ripple has already reached
9TB, and it is growing at an astonishing rate of 12GB per day!
  In this paper, we propose an architecture based on 'fountain codes', a class
of erasure codes, that enables any full node to 'encode' validated blocks into
a small number of 'coded blocks', thereby reducing its storage costs by orders
of magnitude. In particular, our proposed ""Secure Fountain (SeF)"" architecture
can achieve a near-optimal trade-off between the storage savings per node and
the 'bootstrap cost' in terms of the number of (honest) storage-constrained
nodes a new node needs to contact to recover the blockchain. A key technical
innovation in SeF codes is to make fountain codes secure against adversarial
nodes that can provide maliciously formed coded blocks. Our idea is to use the
header-chain as a 'side-information' to check whether a coded block is
maliciously formed while it is getting decoded. Further, the 'rateless
property' of fountain codes helps in achieving high decentralization and
scalability. Our experiments demonstrate that SeF codes tuned to achieve 1000x
storage savings enable full nodes to encode the 191GB Bitcoin blockchain into
195MB on average. A new node can recover the blockchain from an arbitrary set
of storage-constrained nodes as long as the set contains ~1100 honest nodes on
average. Note that for a 1000x storage savings, the fundamental bound on the
number of honest nodes to contact is 1000: we need about 10% more in practice.

phenomenon shaping the structure and evolution of planetary atmospheres.
Therefore, the present-day properties of a planetary atmosphere are intimately
connected with the amount of stellar flux received by a planet during its
lifetime, thus with the evolutionary path of its host star. Using a recently
developed analytic approximation based on hydrodynamic simulations for
atmospheric escape rates, we track within a Bayesian framework the evolution of
a planet as a function of stellar flux evolution history, constrained by the
measured planetary radius, with the other system parameters as priors. We find
that the ideal objects for this type of study are close-in sub-Neptune-like
planets, as they are highly affected by atmospheric escape, and yet retain a
significant fraction of their primordial hydrogen-dominated atmospheres.
Furthermore, we apply this analysis to the HD3167 and K2-32 planetary systems.
For HD3167, we find that the most probable irradiation level at 150 Myr was
between 40 and 130 times solar, corresponding to a rotation period of
1.78^{+2.69}_{-1.23} days. For K2-32, we find a surprisingly low irradiation
level ranging between half and four times solar at 150 Myr. Finally, we show
that for multi-planet systems, our framework enables one to constrain poorly
known properties of individual planets.

on electrons produced by dark matter (DM) annihilation in the Coma cluster. We
use a simplified phenomenological model to describe the effect of the
turbulences, and explore a limited subset of three possible DM models for
neutralino particles with different mass and annihilation channel. We find
that, for values of the annihilation cross section of the order of the upper
limits found with Fermi-LAT measurements in astrophysical objects, and for
conservative values of the boosting factor due to DM substructures, the
reacceleration due to turbulences can enhance the radio emission produced by
DM-originated electrons up to the level of the observed flux of the radio halo
in Coma, for moderate reacceleration intensity in relatively short times.
Therefore we conclude that, even if it is not possible to distinguish between
the fits obtained in this paper because of the scattering present in the radio
flux data, the electrons produced by DM annihilation can be possible seed
electrons for the reacceleration, as well as secondary electrons of hadronic
origin. A possible discriminant between these two classes of models is the flux
produced in the gamma ray band, that in the case of DM-originated electrons
should be more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the present Fermi-LAT
upper limits, whereas in the hadronic case the expected gamma ray flux should
be close to the value of present upper limits.

We combined data on time-averaged spectra of selected blazars that were

nonmigrating components observed in the meridional wind recorded from meteor
ablation drift velocities around 95-km altitude, and a 20-year climatology of
the different components is presented. The well-documented late summer and
wintertime maxima in the semidiurnal winds are shown to be due primarily to the
migrating SDT, whereas during late autumn and spring the nonmigrating

the SDT components during SSWs is then examined by compositing 13 SSW events

non-linear regression as causal model can be bounded from above whenever
functions are taken from a not too rich class. In other words, the bound

wide range of parameters describing the considered system, the anomalous Nernst

various diseases, including diabetes, ophthalmologic diseases, and

method for vessel segmentation in color fundus images using encoder-decoder
based octave convolution networks. Compared with other convolution networks
utilizing standard convolution for feature extraction, the proposed method
utilizes octave convolutions and octave transposed convolutions for learning
multiple-spatial-frequency features, thus can better capture retinal
vasculatures with varying sizes and shapes. To provide the network the
capability of learning how to decode multifrequency features, we extend octave
convolution and propose a new operation named octave transposed convolution. A
novel architecture of convolutional neural network, named as Octave UNet
integrating both octave convolutions and octave transposed convolutions is
proposed based on the encoder-decoder architecture of UNet, which can generate
high resolution vessel segmentation in one single forward feeding without

nature of interference between Autler-Townes (AT) peaks (or dressed states) in
generic multi-level system. The destructive interference between the AT peaks,
gives rise to sharp transparency window known as electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT). In the three-level system, the two AT peaks interferes
pair-wise with each other, almost similar to the two-slit interference. In the
four-level system, the interference between the three AT peaks is also
pair-wise analogous to three-slit interference but has a bit more complicated
nature of interference. However, in many practical situations in atomic systems
only the simple form of interference similar to three-level system dominates.
In the three-level system, the nature of interference (i.e. constructive,
destructive or zero/no interference) between the two AT peaks is purely
determined by the natural decay rate of the states coupled by the control
laser. However, in four-level system the nature of interference between the two
extreme AT peaks can be tuned from constructive to destructive by tuning the
power of the control laser.

graphs. It is commonly used for clustering network data by aggregating nodes
that share similar connectivity patterns into blocks. When fitting an SBM to a
network which is partially observed, it is important to take into account the
underlying process that generates the missing values, otherwise the inference
may be biased. This paper introduces missSBM, an R-package fitting the SBM when
the network is partially observed, i.e., the adjacency matrix contains not only
1's or 0's encoding presence or absence of edges but also NA's encoding missing
information between pairs of nodes. This package implements a set of algorithms
for fitting the binary SBM, possibly in the presence of external covariates, by
performing variational inference adapted to several observation processes. Our
implementation automatically explores different block numbers to select the
most relevant model according to the Integrated Classification Likelihood (ICL)
criterion. The ICL criterion can also help determine which observation process
better corresponds to a given dataset. Finally, missSBM can be used to perform
imputation of missing entries in the adjacency matrix. We illustrate the
package on a network data set consisting of interactions between political
blogs sampled during the French presidential election in 2007.

asserting computability using an elegant synthetic argument, exploiting
uniqueness in a computably compact space of probability measures; and once
presenting and analyzing an explicit, imperative algorithm based on 'maximum

computational complexity, for the groups $\mathcal{SO}(3)$ and
$\mathcal{SU}(2)$ we reduce the Haar integral to and from Euclidean/Riemann

empirical evaluation using the iRRAM C++ library for exact real computation
confirms the (thus necessary) exponential runtime.

fixed and moving images as well as their segmentations are available for
training, while segmentations are not available during testing; a common

generator network that estimates the deformation vector field (DVF) between
fixed and moving images in an unsupervised fashion and applies this DVF to the
moving image and its segmentation. A discriminator network is trained to
evaluate how well the moving image and segmentation align with the fixed image
and segmentation. The proposed network was trained and evaluated on follow-up
prostate CT scans for image-guided radiotherapy, where the planning CT contours
are propagated to the daily CT images using the estimated DVF. A quantitative
comparison with conventional registration using \texttt{elastix} showed that
the proposed method improved performance and substantially reduced computation

generalizes to arbitrary reflecting boundaries, e.g. boundaries that are curved

boundary absorption, source directivity, and nonspecular reflections. This
framework is based on the notion of reflection paths that allows the
introduction of the concepts of validity and visibility of virtual sources.
These definitions facilitate the determination, for a given source and receiver
location, of the distribution of virtual sources that explain the boundary
effects of a wide range of reflecting surfaces. The structure of the set of
virtual sources is then more general than just punctual virtual sources. Due to
this more diverse configuration of image sources, we represent the room impulse
response as an integral involving the temporal excitation signal against a
measure determined by the source and receiver locations, and the original
boundary. The latter smoothly enables, in an analytically tractable manner, the
incorporation of more general boundary shapes as well as directivity of sources
and boundary absorption while, at the same time, maintaining the conceptual
benefits of the image source method.

operates in compressible hydrodynamic turbulence. In general, there is no
conservative compressible cascade since the kinetic and internal energy
reservoirs can exchange energy through pressure dilatation. Moreover,
statistically stationary turbulence at high Mach number can only be maintained
in nearly isothermal gas, i.e., if excess heat produced by shock compression
and kinetic energy dissipation is continuously removed from the system. We
mimic this process by a linear cooling term in numerical simulations of
turbulence driven by stochastic forcing. This allows us to investigate
turbulence statistics for a broad range of Mach numbers. We compute the rate of
change of kinetic and internal energy in wavenumber shells caused by advective,
compressive, and pressure dilatation effects and constrain power-law fits to
compressible turbulence energy spectra to a range of wavenumbers in which the
total energy transfer is close to zero. The resulting scaling exponents are
significantly affected by the forcing. Depending on the root mean square Mach
number, we find a nearly constant advective component of the cross-scale flux
of kinetic energy at intermediate wavenumbers for particular mixtures of
solenoidal and compressive modes in the forcing. This suggests the existence of
a natural, Mach number dependent mixture of forcing modes. Our findings also
support an advection-dominated regime at high Mach numbers with specific
scaling exponents (Burgers scaling for the pure velocity fluctuation $u$ and
Kolmogorov scaling for the mass-weighted variable $v=\rho^{1/3}u$).

others about the wave function is that it is defined on the
$3\mathbf{N}$-dimensional configuration space, rather than on the
$3$-dimensional physical space. This gives the impression that quantum
mechanics cannot have a three-dimensional space or spacetime ontology, even in
the absence of quantum measurements. In particular, this seems to affect
interpretations which take the wave function as a physical entity, in
particular the many worlds and the spontaneous collapse interpretations, and
some versions of the pilot wave theory.
  Here, a representation of the many-particle states is given, as multi-layered
fields defined on the $3$-dimensional physical space. This representation is
equivalent to the usual representation on the configuration space, but it makes
it explicit that it is possible to interpret the wave functions as defined on
the physical space. As long as only unitary evolution is involved, the
interactions are local. I intended this representation to capture and formalize
the non-explicit and informal intuition of many working quantum physicists,
who, by considering the wave function sometimes to be defined on the
configuration space, and sometimes on the physical space, may seem to
researchers in the foundations of quantum theory as adopting an inconsistent
view about its ontology. This representation does not aim to solve the
measurement problem, and it allows for Schr\""odinger cats just like the usual
one. But it may help various interpretations to solve these problems, through
inclusion of the wave function as (part of) their primitive ontology.
  In an appendix, it is shown how the multi-layered field representation can be
extended to quantum field theory.

the statistics literature, we are able to adaptively determine appropriate
numbers of data splits and random seeds used to evaluate each model, focusing
computational resources on the evaluation of promising models whilst avoiding
wasting evaluations on models with lower performance. Furthermore, our
user-friendly Python implementation produces confidence guarantees of correctly

literature findings, provide evidence that TDEs transition from an early-time
soft state to a late-time hard state many years after disruption. We propose
that the time to peak luminosity for optical and X-ray emission may differ
substantially in TDEs, with X-rays being produced or becoming observable later.
This delay helps explain the differences in observed properties such as
L_opt/L_ X of optically and X-ray selected TDEs. We update TDE rate predictions
for the eROSITA instrument: it ranges from 3 per yr to 990 per yr, depending
sensitively on the distribution of black hole spins and the time delay between
disruption and peak X-ray brightness. We further predict an asymmetry in the
number of retrograde and prograde disks in samples of optically and X-ray
selected TDEs. The details of the observational biases can contribute to
observed differences between optically and X-ray selected TDEs (with optically
selected TDEs being fainter in X-rays for retrograde TDE disks).

automata-based modelling formalisms. In this work, we study L*-based learning
of deterministic Markov decision processes, first assuming an ideal setting
with perfect information. Then, we relax this assumption and present a novel
learning algorithm that collects information by sampling system traces via
testing. Experiments with the implementation of our sampling-based algorithm
suggest that it achieves better accuracy than state-of-the-art passive learning
techniques with the same amount of test data. Unlike existing learning
algorithms with predefined states, our algorithm learns the complete model
structure including the states.

the structure of gene regulatory networks from time-series data. However, the
applicability and accuracy presumptions of such algorithms remain unclear due
to experimental heterogeneity. This paper assesses the performance of recent
and successful network inference strategies under a novel, multifactorial
evaluation framework in order to highlight pragmatic tradeoffs in experimental
design. The effects of data quantity and systems perturbations are addressed,
thereby formulating guidelines for efficient resource management.
  Realistic data were generated from six widely used benchmark models of
rhythmic and non-rhythmic gene regulatory systems with random perturbations
mimicking the effect of gene knock-out or chemical treatments. Then,
time-series data of increasing lengths were provided to five state-of-the-art
network inference algorithms representing distinctive mathematical paradigms.
The performances of such network reconstruction methodologies are uncovered
under various experimental conditions. We report that the algorithms do not
benefit equally from data increments. Furthermore, for rhythmic systems, it is
more profitable for network inference strategies to be run on long time-series
rather than short time-series with multiple perturbations. By contrast, for the
non-rhythmic systems, increasing the number of perturbation experiments yielded
better results than increasing the sampling frequency. We expect that future
benchmark and algorithm design would integrate such multifactorial
considerations to promote their widespread and conscientious usage.

crystal dynamics at the atomic scale in space but on diffusive scales in time.
In particular, a modification of the free energy potential to the standard
phase field crystal model leads to a composition of the 4-Laplacian and the
regular Laplacian operators. To overcome the difficulties associated with this
highly nonlinear operator, we design numerical algorithms based on the
structures of the individual energy terms. A Fourier pseudo-spectral
approximation is taken in space, in such a way that the energy structure is
respected, and summation-by-parts formulae enable us to study the discrete
energy stability for such a high-order spatial discretization. In the temporal
approximation, a second order BDF stencil is applied, combined with an
appropriate extrapolation for the concave diffusion term(s). A second order
artificial Douglas-Dupont-type regularization term is added to ensure energy
stability, and a careful analysis leads to the artificial linear diffusion
coming at an order lower that that of surface diffusion term. Such a choice
leads to reduced numerical dissipation. At a theoretical level, the unique
solvability, energy stability are established, and an optimal rate convergence
analysis is derived in the $\ell^\infty (0,T; \ell^2) \cap \ell^2 (0,T; H_N^3)$
norm. In the numerical implementation, the preconditioned steepest descent
(PSD) iteration is applied to solve for the composition of the highly nonlinear
4-Laplacian term and the standard Laplacian term, and a geometric convergence
is assured for such an iteration. Finally, a few numerical experiments are
presented, which confirm the robustness and accuracy of the proposed scheme.

present a model that is capable of simultaneously predicting the three main
gravitational-wave observables: the effective inspiral spin parameter
$\chi_{eff}$, the chirp mass $M_{chirp}$, and the cosmological redshift of
merger $z_{merger}$. We find an excellent agreement between our model and the
ten events from the first two advanced detector observing runs. We make
predictions for the third observing run O3 and for Advanced LIGO design
sensitivity. We expect around 80% of events with $\chi_{eff} < 0.1$, while the
remaining 20% of events with $\chi_{eff} \ge 0.1$ are split into ~10% with
$M_{chirp} < 15$ M$_\odot$ and ~10% with $M_{chirp} \ge 15$ M$_\odot$. In
conclusion, the favorable comparison of the existing LIGO/Virgo observations
with our model predictions gives support to the idea that the majority, if not
all of the observed mergers, originate from the evolution of isolated binaries.
The first-born black hole has negligible spin because it lost its envelope
after it expanded to become a giant star, while the spin of the second-born
black hole is determined by the tidal spin up of its naked helium star
progenitor by the first-born black hole companion after the binary finished the
common-envelope phase.

restricted to theoretical studies only constrained by observations of their
global properties and external characteristics. However, in the last thirty
years the field has been revolutionized by the ability to perform seismic
investigations of stellar interiors. This revolution begun with the Sun, where
helioseismology has been yielding information competing with what can be
inferred about the Earth's interior from geoseismology. The last two decades
have witnessed the advent of asteroseismology of solar-like stars, thanks to a
dramatic development of new observing facilities providing the first reliable
results on the interiors of distant stars. The coming years will see a huge
development in this field. In this review we focus on solar-type stars, i.e.,
cool main-sequence stars where oscillations are stochastically excited by
surface convection. After a short introduction and a historical overview of the
discipline, we review the observational techniques generally used, and we
describe the theory behind stellar oscillations in cool main-sequence stars. We
continue with a complete description of the normal mode analyses through which
it is possible to extract the physical information about the structure and
dynamics of the stars. We then summarize the lessons that we have learned and
discuss unsolved issues and questions that are still unanswered.

derived from kinetic theory arguments. Polyelectrolyte molecules are modeled as
finitely elongated nonlinear elastic dumbbells, where effective charges
(interacting through a simple Coulomb force) are added to the beads in order to
model the repulsion between the charged sections of polyelectrolyte chains. It
is shown that the relative strength of this repulsion is regulated by the
electric-to-elastic energy ratio, $E$, which is one of the key parameters of
the model. In particular, $E$ accounts for the intrinsic rigidity of
polyelectrolyte molecules and can be used to explain the impact of solvent
salinity on polyelectrolyte rheology. With two preaveraging approximations, the
constitutive equations of the resulting fluid model are formulated in closed
form. Material functions predicted by the model for steady shear flow, steady
extensional flow, small-amplitude oscillatory shear flow, and start-up and
cessation of steady shear flow are obtained and investigated using a
combination of analytical and numerical methods. In particular, it is shown how
these material functions depend on $E$. The two limiting cases of the model --
uncharged dumbbells ($E=0$) and rigid dumbbells ($E\to \infty$) -- are included

For a small number of particles (N<=6), we identify the zero-temperature

When the number of particles is large (N>=100), we distinguish different

collecting and analyzing data, which has been used, e.g., in the Chrome
browser, iOS and macOS. In LDP, each user perturbs her information locally, and
only sends the randomized version to an aggregator who performs analyses, which
protects both the users and the aggregator against private information leaks.
Although LDP has attracted much research attention in recent years, the
majority of existing work focuses on applying LDP to complex data and/or
analysis tasks. In this paper, we point out that the fundamental problem of
collecting multidimensional data under LDP has not been addressed sufficiently,
and there remains much room for improvement even for basic tasks such as
computing the mean value over a single numeric attribute under LDP. Motivated
by this, we first propose novel LDP mechanisms for collecting a numeric
attribute, whose accuracy is at least no worse (and usually better) than
existing solutions in terms of worst-case noise variance. Then, we extend these
mechanisms to multidimensional data that can contain both numeric and
categorical attributes, where our mechanisms always outperform existing
solutions regarding worst-case noise variance. As a case study, we apply our
solutions to build an LDP-compliant stochastic gradient descent algorithm
(SGD), which powers many important machine learning tasks. Experiments using
real datasets confirm the effectiveness of our methods, and their advantages
over existing solutions.

cross section, because of its two major isotopes: $^{\rm 155}$Gd and $^{\rm

capture on targets comprising a natural gadolinium film and enriched $^{\rm
155}$Gd (in Gd$_{2}$O$_{3}$ powder) in the energy range from 0.11 MeV to 8.0
MeV, using the ANNRI germanium spectrometer at MLF, J-PARC. The freshly
analysed data of the $^{\rm 155}$Gd(n, $\gamma$) reaction are used to improve
our previously developed model (ANNRI-Gd model) for the $^{\rm 157}$Gd(n,
$\gamma$) reaction, and its performance confirmed with the independent data
from the $^{\rm nat}$Gd(n, $\gamma$) reaction. This article completes the
development of an efficient Monte Carlo model required to simulate and analyse
particle interactions involving the thermal neutron captures on gadolinium in
any relevant future experiments.

transmitted signals are corrupted by fading and additive noise. First, a
universal lower bound on the average symbol error probability (SEP), correct
for all M-ary modulation schemes, is obtained when the number of quantization
bits is not enough to resolve M signal points. Second, in the special case of
M-ary phase shift keying (M-PSK), the optimum maximum likelihood detector for
equiprobable signal points is derived. Third, utilizing the structure of the
derived optimum receiver, a general average SEP expression for the M-PSK
modulation with n-bit quantization is obtained when the wireless channel is
subject to fading with a circularly-symmetric distribution. Finally, an
extensive simulation study of the derived analytical results is presented for
general Nakagami-m fading channels. It is observed that a transceiver
architecture with n-bit quantization is asymptotically optimum in terms of
communication reliability if n is greater than or equal to log_2(M +1). That
is, the decay exponent for the average SEP is the same and equal to m with
infinite-bit and n-bit quantizers for n greater than or equal to log_2(M+1). On
the other hand, it is only equal to half and 0 for n = log_2(M) and n <
log_2(M), respectively. Hence, for fading environments with a large value of m,
using an extra quantization bit improves communication reliability
significantly.

in the Universe, constituting an important probe of the cosmological
predictions. Halos are not directly observable, however, so their mass and
evolution must be inferred indirectly. Studies based on the assumption of a
constant halo to stellar mass ratio M_h/M_* (extrapolated from z<4) reveal
significant tension with LCDM---a failure known as ""The Impossibly Early Galaxy
Problem"". But whether this ratio evolves or remains constant through redshift
4<z<10 is still being debated. To eliminate the tension with LCDM, it would
have to change by about 0.8 dex over this range, an issue that may be settled
by upcoming observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. In this paper, we
study this problem in the context of another
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model known as the R_h=ct universe,
and use our previous measurement of sigma_8 from the cosmological growth rate,
together with new solutions to the Einstein-Boltzmann equations, to interpret
these recent halo measurements. We demonstrate that the predicted mass and
redshift dependence of the halo distribution in R_h=ct is consistent with the
data, even assuming a constant M_h/M_* throughout the observed redshift range
(4<z<10), contrasting sharply with the tension in LCDM. We conclude that---if
M_h/M_* turns out to be constant---the massive galaxies and their halos must
have formed earlier than is possible in LCDM.

However, most projects run on business narratives with no way to test and
verify their assumptions and promises about the future. The complex nature of
system dynamics within networked economies has rendered it difficult to reason
about the growth and evolution of these networks. This paper drew concepts from
differential games, classical control engineering, and stochastic dynamical
system to come up with a framework and example to model, simulate, and engineer
networked token economies. A model on a generalized token economy is proposed
where miners provide service to a platform in exchange for a cryptocurrency and
users consume service from the platform. Simulations of this model allow us to
observe outcomes of complex dynamics and reason about the evolution of the
system. Speculative price movements and engineered block rewards were then
experimented to observe their impact on system dynamics and network-level
goals. The model presented is necessarily limited so we conclude by exploring
those limitations and outlining future research directions.

Here, we propose a low-cost strategy to predict the accuracy of the algorithm,
based only on its initial behaviour. To do so, we train the network of interest
up to convergence several times, modifying its characteristics at each
training. The initial and final accuracies observed during this beforehand
process are stored in a database. We then make use of both curve fitting and
Support Vector Machines techniques, the latter being trained on the created
database, to predict the accuracy of the network, given its accuracy on the
primary iterations of its learning. This approach can be of particular interest
when the space of the characteristics of the network is notably large or when
its full training is highly time-consuming. The results we obtained are
promising and encouraged us to apply this strategy to a topical issue:
hyper-parameter optimisation (HO). In particular, we focused on the HO of a
convolutional neural network for the classification of the databases MNIST and
CIFAR-10. By using our method of prediction, and an algorithm implemented by us

displays more pleasing behavior than its $f(R,T)$ counterpart.

vision systems, especially for autonomous driving applications. In this work,
we present Voxel-FPN, a novel one-stage 3D object detector that utilizes raw
data from LIDAR sensors only. The core framework consists of an encoder network
and a corresponding decoder followed by a region proposal network. Encoder
extracts multi-scale voxel information in a bottom-up manner while decoder
fuses multiple feature maps from various scales in a top-down way. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed method has better performance on extracting
features from point data and demonstrates its superiority over some baselines
on the challenging KITTI-3D benchmark, obtaining good performance on both speed
and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

  Segmentation","20 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show outstanding performance in many
image processing problems, such as image recognition, object detection and
image segmentation. Semantic segmentation is a very challenging task that
requires recognizing, understanding what's in the image in pixel level. Though
the state of the art has been greatly improved by CNNs, there is no explicit
connections between prediction of neighbouring pixels. That is, spatial
regularity of the segmented objects is still a problem for CNNs. In this paper,
we propose a method to add spatial regularization to the segmented objects. In
our method, the spatial regularization such as total variation (TV) can be
easily integrated into CNN network. It can help CNN find a better local optimum
and make the segmentation results more robust to noise. We apply our proposed
method to Unet and Segnet, which are well established CNNs for image
segmentation, and test them on WBC, CamVid and SUN-RGBD datasets, respectively.
The results show that the regularized networks not only could provide better
segmentation results with regularization effect than the original ones but also
have certain robustness to noise.

  information",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Landmarks are important features of spatial cognition. Landmarks are
naturally included in human route descriptions and in the past algorithms were
developed to select the most salient landmarks at decision points and
automatically incorporate them in route instructions. Moreover, it was shown
that human route descriptions contain a significant amount of orientation
information and that these orientation information support the acquisition of
survey knowledge. Thus, there is a need to extend the landmarks selection in
order to automatically select orientation information. In this work we present
an algorithm for the computational selection of route dependent orientation
information, which extends previous algorithms and includes a salience
evaluation of orientation information for any location along the route. We
implemented the algorithm and demonstrate the functionality on the basis of
OpenStreetMap data.

  function valleys maze","24 pages, 17 figures",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lens designers routinely use optimization in their everyday practice. Local
optimization algorithms lead to the nearest minimum. In this paper, a new
deterministic approach for multi-extremum optimization is proposed. Optimal
solutions for even moderate complexity optical architectures are shown to be
located within extended merit function valleys. Merit function minimums are
separated by saddle points. An effective algorithm to travel over these valleys
from one local minimum through a saddle point to another minimum is proposed.
From this new minimum, a new valley is found which leads through another saddle
point to another minimum and so on.. In a finite number of steps, a complete
mutually connected system of stationary points (minimums and saddle points) are
revealed, giving a reasonable assurance that the search is completed.

  Superimposed Signals",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Superimposed signals are anticipated to improve wireless spectrum efficiency
to support the ever-growing IoT applications. Implementing the superimposed
signal demands on ideally aligned signals in both the time and frequency
domains. Prior work applied an average carrier-frequency offset compensation to
the superimposed signal under the assumptions of homogeneous devices and static
environments. However, this will cause a significant signal distortion in
practice when heterogeneous IoT devices are involved in a dynamic environment.
This paper presents PhyCode, which exploits the nature of varying offsets
across devices, and designs a dynamic decoding scheme which can react to the
exact offsets from different signal sources simultaneously. We implement
PhyCode via a software-defined radio platform and demonstrate that PhyCode
achieves a lower raw BER compared with the existing state-of-the-art method.

attracted a great interest due to their potential applications in future
spintronics and ultra high dense magnetic memory devices. Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ is
only known insulating chiral helimagnet with multiple phases including skyrmion
phase. Existence of skyrmion phase as well as first and second order phase
transitions make Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ a promissing candidate for investigating
complex magnetic phenomena. Here, we report that both first and second order
magnetic phase transitions are responsible in determining the phase diagram
with atleast two multicritical point in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. Fluctuation-induced
first order transition is realized as a precursor for skyrmion phase over a
small window of temperature of magnetic field. The evolution of field dependent
entropy at the phase transition provides the evidence for tricritical point.
Furthermore, existence of commensurate and incommensurate phases, alongwith
co-existence of three second order phase transitions provide evidence for the
existence of Lifshitz point.
