efficient deployment of deep learning application on embedded platforms,
however, converting the network to low precision degrades its performance.
Crucially, networks that are designed for embedded applications usually suffer
from increased degradation since they have less redundancy. This is most
evident for the ubiquitous MobileNet architecture which requires a costly
quantization-aware training cycle to achieve acceptable performance when
quantized to 8-bits. In this paper, we trace the source of the degradation in
MobileNets to a shift in the mean activation value. This shift is caused by an
inherent bias in the quantization process which builds up across layers,
shifting all network statistics away from the learned distribution. We show
that this phenomenon happens in other architectures as well. We propose a
simple remedy - compensating for the quantization induced shift by adding a
constant to the additive bias term of each channel. We develop two simple
methods for estimating the correction constants - one using iterative
evaluation of the quantized network and one where the constants are set using a
short training phase. Both methods are fast and require only a small amount of
unlabeled data, making them appealing for rapid deployment of neural networks.
Using the above methods we are able to match the performance of training-based
quantization of MobileNets at a fraction of the cost.

optimal once, and valid forever. These are ideally also implemented once, and
usable from a wide range of sequential and parallel environments. This paradigm
is evaluated by implementing an immortal fast Fourier transform (FFT) using

system tuned to a nematic quantum critical point (QCP), focusing on the
non-trivial impact of the coupling to the acoustic phonons. Due to the
unavoidable linear coupling between the electronic nematic order parameter and
the lattice strain fields, long-range nematic interactions mediated by the
phonons emerge in the problem. By solving the semi-classical Boltzmann equation
in the presence of scattering by impurities and nematic fluctuations, we
determine the temperature-dependence of the resistivity as the nematic QCP is
approached. One of the main effects of the nemato-elastic coupling is to smooth
the electronic non-equilibrium distribution function, making it approach the
simple cosine angular dependence even when the impurity scattering is not too
strong. We find that at temperatures lower than a temperature scale set by the
nemato-elastic coupling, the resistivity shows the $T^2$ behavior
characteristic of a Fermi liquid. This is in contrast to the $T^{4/3}$
low-temperature behavior expected for a lattice-free nematic quantum critical
point. More importantly, we show that the effective resistivity exponent
$\alpha_\text{eff}(T)$ in $\rho(T)-\rho_0\sim T^{\alpha_\text{eff}(T)}$
displays a pronounced temperature dependence, implying that a nematic QCP
cannot generally be characterized by a simple resistivity exponent. We discuss
the implications of our results to the interpretation of experimental data,

Event-triggered state estimation and event-triggered learning methods reduce

event-triggered learning approach for nonlinear discrete-time systems with
cyclic excitation. The method automatically recognizes cyclic patterns in data
- even when they change repeatedly - and reduces communication load whenever
the current data can be accurately predicted from previous cycles. Nonetheless,
a bounded error between original and received signal is guaranteed. The cyclic
excitation model, which is used for predictions, is updated hierarchically,
i.e., a full model update is only performed if updating a small number of model
parameters is not sufficient. A nonparametric statistical test enforces that
model updates happen only if the cyclic excitation changed with high
probability. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated using
the application example of wireless real-time pitch angle measurements of a
human foot in a feedback-controlled neuroprosthesis. The experimental results
show that communication load can be reduced by 70 % while the root-mean-square
error between measured and received angle is less than 1{\deg}.

control of individual atomic magnetic moments. At these length scales, the
exchange interaction plays important roles, such as in the stabilization of
spin-quantization axes, the production of spin frustration, and creation of
magnetic ordering. Here, we demonstrate the precise control of the exchange
bias experienced by a single atom on a surface, covering an energy range of
four orders of magnitude. The exchange interaction is continuously tunable from
milli-eV to micro-eV by adjusting the separation between a spin-1/2 atom on a
surface and the magnetic tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). We
seamlessly combine inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) and
electron spin resonance (ESR) to map out the different energy scales. This
control of exchange bias over a wide span of energies provides versatile
control of spin states, with applications ranging from precise tuning of
quantum state properties, to strong exchange bias for local spin doping. In
addition we show that a time-varying exchange interaction generates a localized
AC magnetic field that resonantly drives the surface spin. The static and
dynamic control of the exchange interaction at the atomic-scale provides a new
tool to tune the quantum states of coupled-spin systems.

radio- and millimeter interferometric data to study their fragmentation and
evolution. Our sample is unique in the sense that all the clumps have
neighboring HII regions. Taking advantage of that, we test triggered star
formation using a novel method where we study the alignment of the centres of
mass traced by dust emission at multiple scales. The eight massive clumps have
masses ranging from 228 to 2279 $M_\odot$. The brightest compact structures
within infrared bright clumps are typically associated with embedded compact
radio continuum sources. The smaller scale structures of $R_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$
0.02 pc observed within each clump are mostly gravitationally bound and massive
enough to form at least a B3-B0 type star. Many condensations have masses
larger than 8 $M_\odot$ at small scale of $R_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 0.02 pc.
Although the clumps are mostly infrared quiet, the dynamical movements are
active at clump scale ($\sim$ 1 pc). We studied the spatial distribution of the
gas conditions detected at different scales. For some sources we find hints of
external triggering, whereas for others we find no significant pattern that
indicates triggering is dynamically unimportant. This probably indicates that
the different clumps go through different evolutionary paths. In this respect,

universally scale poorly as the number of taxa increases. An additional
challenge arises as obtaining a full suite of measurements becomes increasingly
difficult with increasing taxa. This typically necessitates data imputation or
integration that further exacerbates scalability. We propose an inference
technique that integrates out missing measurements analytically and scales
linearly with the number of taxa by using a post-order traversal algorithm
under a multivariate Brownian diffusion (MBD) model to characterize trait
evolution. We further exploit this technique to extend the MBD model to account
for sampling error or non-heritable residual variance. We test these methods to
examine mammalian life history traits, prokaryotic genomic and phenotypic

given probabilistic selection. A key challenge of using ensembles in
large-scale multidimensional data lies in the complexity and the computational

matter. It is therefore crucial to extend searches for globular cluster streams
to other galaxies than the Milky Way. In this paper, we investigate the current
and future prospects of detecting globular cluster streams in external galaxies
in resolved stars (e.g. with WFIRST) and using integrated light (e.g. with HSC,
LSST and Euclid). In particular, we inject mock-streams to data from the PAndAS
M31 survey, and produce simulated M31 backgrounds mimicking what WFIRST will
observe in M31. Additionally, we estimate the distance limit to which globular
cluster streams will be observable. Our results demonstrate that for a 1 hour
(1000 sec.) exposure, using conservative estimates, WFIRST should detect
globular cluster streams in resolved stars in galaxies out to distances of ~3.5
Mpc (~2 Mpc). This volume contains 199 (122) galaxies of which >90% are dwarfs.
With integrated light, thin streams can be resolved out to ~100 Mpc with HSC
and LSST and to ~600 Mpc with WFIRST and Euclid. The low surface brightness of
the streams (typically >30 mag/arcsec$^2$), however, will make them difficult
to detect, unless the streams originate from very young clusters. We emphasize
that if the external galaxies do not host spiral arms or galactic bars, gaps in
their stellar streams provide an ideal test case for evidence of interactions
with dark matter subhalos. Furthermore, obtaining a large samples of thin
stellar streams can help constrain the orbital structure and hence the
potentials of external halos.

globular clusters (GCs) with a line-of-sight velocity dispersion of
$\sigma=7.8^{+5.2}_{-2.2}\,$km/s ($\sigma=10.6^{+3.9}_{-2.3}\,$km/s). Our
conventional statistical analysis of the original ten GCs gives
$\sigma=8.0^{+4.3}_{-3.0}\,$km/s. The overall distribution of velocities agrees
well with a Gaussian of this width. Due to the non-linear Poisson equation in
MOND, a dwarf galaxy has weaker self-gravity when in close proximity to a
massive host. This external field effect is investigated using a new analytic
formulation and fully self-consistent live $N$-body models in MOND. Our
formulation agrees well with that of Famaey and McGaugh (2012). These new
simulations confirm our analytic results and suggest that DF2 may be in a
deep-freeze state unique to MOND. The correctly calculated MOND velocity
dispersion agrees with our inferred dispersion and that of van Dokkum et al.
(2018b) if DF2 is within 150 kpc of NGC 1052 and both are 20 Mpc away. The GCs
of DF2 are however significantly brighter and larger than normal GCs, a problem
which disappears if DF2 is significantly closer to us. A distance of 10-13 Mpc
makes DF2 a normal dwarf galaxy even more consistent with MOND and the 13 Mpc
distance reported by Trujillo et. al. (2019). We discuss the similar dwarf DF4,
finding good agreement with MOND. We also discuss possible massive galaxies
near DF2 and DF4 along with their distances and peculiar velocities, noting
that NGC 1052 may lie at a distance near 10 Mpc.

close-in CB planets is similar to that around single stars. By contrast, at
longer periods ranging from $30-10^5$ days (where the nodal degeneracy can be
broken via, e.g., binary astrometry), CB disks exhibit a wide range of mutual
inclinations, from co-planar to polar. Many of these long-period binaries are
eccentric, as their component stars are too far separated to be tidally
circularized. We discuss how theories of binary formation and disk-binary
gravitational interactions can accommodate all these observations.

traced to the impossibility of isolating single-particle states at asymptotic

universal: in gauge theories they factorize so that the asymptotic evolution is
independent of the hard scattering. Exploiting this factorization property, we
show how a finite ""hard"" $S$-matrix, $S_H$, can be defined by replacing the
free Hamiltonian with a soft-collinear asymptotic Hamiltonian. The elements of
$S_H$ are gauge invariant and infrared finite, and exist even in conformal
field theories. One can interpret elements of $S_H$ alternatively 1) as
elements of the traditional $S$-matrix between dressed states, 2) as Wilson

focused on this issue model the jet-ICM interaction as a spherically symmetric
explosion, finding that <~ 12.5% of the blast energy is converted into sound
waves, even for instantaneous energy injection. We develop a method for
measuring sound wave energy in hydrodynamic simulations and measure the
efficiency of sound wave driving by supersonic jets in a model ICM. Our

long-wavelength sound waves which can propagate to large distances. Vigorous
instabilities driven by the jet-ICM interaction generate small-scale sound

scanning a parameter space of opening angles, velocities, and densities, we
study how our results depend on jet properties. High velocity, wide angle jets
produce sound waves most efficiently, yet the acoustic efficiency never exceeds
1/3 of the jet energy -- an indication that equipartition may limit the
nonlinear energy conversion process. Our work argues that sound waves may

  Time-Resolved Measurement",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy suffers from source shot noise - random
variation in the number of incident ions in any fixed dwell time - along with
random variation in the number of detected secondary electrons per incident
ion. This multiplicity of sources of randomness increases the variance of the
measurements and thus worsens the trade-off between incident ion dose and image
accuracy. Time-resolved sensing combined with maximum likelihood estimation
from the resulting sets of measurements greatly reduces the effect of source
shot noise. Through Fisher information analysis and Monte Carlo simulations,
the reduction in mean-squared error or reduction in required dose is shown to
be by a factor approximately equal to the secondary electron yield. Experiments
with a helium ion microscope (HIM) are consistent with the analyses and suggest
accuracy improvement for a fixed source dose, or reduced source dose for a
desired imaging accuracy, by a factor of about 3.

the RNAP. Textbook pictures depict such domains as symmetric, with plectonemes
(writhed DNA) appearing close to the RNAP. On the contrary, we find that the
twist generated by transcription results in asymmetric domains, with
plectonemes formed far from the RNAP. We show that this translates into an
""action-at-a-distance"" on DNA-binding proteins: for instance, positive
supercoils downstream of an elongating RNAP destabilise nucleosomes long before
the transcriptional machinery reaches the histone octamer. To understand these
observations we use our framework to quantitatively analyse the relaxation
dynamics of supercoiled DNA. We find a striking separation of timescales
between twist diffusion, which is a simple and fast process, and writhe
relaxation, which is slow and entails multiple steps.

of relativistic outflows, including jets of active galactic nuclei (AGN).
Motivated by the largely unknown plasma composition of AGN jets, we study
reconnection in the unexplored regime of electron-positron-proton (pair-proton)
plasmas with large-scale two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. We cover
a wide range of pair multiplicities (lepton-to-proton number ratio
$\kappa=1-199$) for different values of the all-species plasma magnetization
($\sigma=1,3$ and 10) and electron temperature ($\Theta_e\equiv
kT_e/m_ec^2=0.1-100$). We focus on the dependence of the post-reconnection
energy partition and lepton energy spectra on the hot pair plasma magnetization
$\sigma_{e,h}$ (i.e., the ratio of magnetic to pair enthalpy densities). We
find that the post-reconnection energy is shared roughly equally between
magnetic fields, pairs, and protons for $\sigma_{e,h}\gtrsim 3$. We empirically
find that the mean lepton Lorentz factor in the post-reconnection region
depends on $\sigma, \Theta_e$, and $\sigma_{e,h}$ as $\langle \gamma_e-1\rangle
\approx \sqrt{\sigma}(1+4\Theta_e)\left(1+\sigma_{e,h}/30\right)$, for
$\sigma\ge1$. The high-energy part of the post-reconnection lepton energy
distributions can be described by a power law, whose slope is mainly controlled
by $\sigma_{e,h}$ for $\kappa \gtrsim 3-6$, with harder power laws obtained for
higher magnetizations. We finally show that reconnection in pair-proton plasmas
with multiplicities $\kappa \sim 1-20$, magnetizations $\sigma \sim 1-10$, and
temperatures $\Theta_e \sim 1-10$ results in particle power law slopes and
average electron Lorentz factors that are consistent with those inferred in
leptonic models of AGN jet emission.

an optimally robust classifier, which is analogous to the Bayes Optimal. We
show that adversarial pruning can be viewed as a finite sample approximation to
this optimal classifier. We empirically show that our defense and attack are
either better than or competitive with prior work on non-parametric
classifiers. Overall, our results provide a strong and broadly-applicable
baseline for future work on robust non-parametrics. Code available at

nutrient minerals especially of nitrogen, potassium, calcium, phosphorus and
iron is a huge problem for agriculture and early warning and prevention of the
problem will be very useful for agro-industry. Methods currently used to
determine nutritional deficiency in plants are soil analysis, plant tissue
analysis, or combined methods. But these methods are slow and expensive. In
this study, a new method for determining nutrient deficiency in plants based on
the prompt fluorescence of chlorophyll a is proposed. In this paper bean plants
are grown on a complete nutrient solution (control) were compared with those
grown in a medium, which lacked one of these elements - N, P, K, Ca and Fe. In
this article the mineral deficiency in nutrient solution was evaluated by the
stress response of the plants estimated by leaves photosynthetic activity. The
photosynthetic activity was estimated by analysis of the chlorophyll
fluorescence using JIP-test approach that reflects functional activity of
Photosystems I and II and of electron transfer chain between them, as well as
the physiological state of the photosynthetic apparatus as whole. Next the
fluorescence transient recorded from plants grown in nutrient solution with
deficiency of N, P, K, Ca and Iron, as an input data in Artificial Neural
Network was used. This ANN was train to recognise deficiency of N, P, K, Ca and
Iron in bean plants. The results obtained were of high recognition accuracy.
The ANN of fluorescence transient was presented as a possible approach to
identify/predict the nutrient deficiency using the fast chlorophyll

to count model likelihoods, which makes inference challenging. Here we address
this obstacle by introducing a fast, approximate inference method for
non-conjugate GPFA models. Our approach uses orthogonal second-order

accurate closed-form evaluation of marginal likelihoods and fast numerical

the PAL estimation is highly accurate, and achieves faster convergence times

hyperparameters can provide sensible initialization for black box variational

extreme exoplanetary system candidates around the pulsating B-type subdwarfs
KIC 10001893 and KIC 5807616 from the primary $\it{Kepler}$ field.
  $\bf{Aims}$. Our goal was to find characteristics and the source of weak
signals that are observed in these subdwarf light curves.
  $\bf{Methods}$. To achieve this, we analyzed short- and long-cadence
$\it{Kepler}$ data of the two stars by means of a Fourier transform and
compared the results to Fourier transforms of simulated light curves to which
we added exoplanetary signals. The long-cadence data of KIC 10001893 were
extracted from CCD images of a nearby star, KIC 10001898, using a point spread
function reduction technique.
  $\bf{Results}$. It appears that the amplitudes of the Fourier transform
signals that were found in the low-frequency region depend on the methods that
are used to extract and prepare $\it{Kepler}$ data. We demonstrate that using a
comparison star for space telescope data can significantly reduce artifacts.
Our simulations also show that a weak signal of constant amplitude and
frequency, added to a stellar light curve, conserves its frequency in Fourier
transform amplitude spectra to within 0.03 $\mu$Hz.
  $\bf{Conclusions}$. Based on our simulations, we conclude that the two
low-frequency Fourier transform signals found in KIC 5807616 are likely the
combined frequencies of the lower amplitude pulsating modes of the star. In the
case of KIC 10001893, the signal amplitudes that are visible in the light curve
depend on the data set and reduction methods. The strongest signal decreases
significantly in amplitude when KIC 10001898 is used as a comparison star.
Finally, we recommend that the signal detection threshold is increased to 5
$\sigma$ (or higher) for a Fourier transform analysis of $\it{Kepler}$ data in
low-frequency regions.

  A simple example witnesses that $\alpha(k) \geq \frac{k-1}{2k-1}$ for all
$k$, and [Schneider et al., 2017] conjectures that this is tight (and prove it
is tight for $k=2$). Our first result refutes this conjecture: there exists a

has provided practitioners newfound access to fast, reproducible data analysis

computationally scalable and theoretically sound, however, remains a
significant challenge. Recent work on Bayesian coresets takes the approach of
compressing the dataset before running a standard inference algorithm,
providing both scalability and guarantees on posterior approximation error. But
the automation of past coreset methods is limited because they depend on the
availability of a reasonable coarse posterior approximation, which is difficult
to specify in practice. In the present work we remove this requirement by
formulating coreset construction as sparsity-constrained variational inference
within an exponential family. This perspective leads to a novel construction
via greedy optimization, and also provides a unifying information-geometric
view of present and past methods. The proposed Riemannian coreset construction
algorithm is fully automated, requiring no problem-specific inputs aside from
the probabilistic model and dataset. In addition to being significantly easier
to use than past methods, experiments demonstrate that past coreset
constructions are fundamentally limited by the fixed coarse posterior
approximation; in contrast, the proposed algorithm is able to continually
improve the coreset, providing state-of-the-art Bayesian dataset summarization

cumbersome to satisfy in common modeling situations. By considering manifolds
with corners, a generalization of manifolds and manifolds with boundary, this
work constitutes a step towards a unified treatment of classical integral
theorems for the 'unbounded case' for which the boundary of the evolving set

multi-million-degree corona to the much cooler chromosphere. The temperature
and density structure of quasi-static loops is determined by the continuous
flow of energy from the hot corona to the lower solar atmosphere. Loop scaling
laws provide relationships between global properties of the loop (such as peak
temperature, pressure, and length); they follow from the physical variable
dependencies of various terms in the energy equation, and hence the form of the
loop scaling law provides insight into the key physics that controls the loop
structure. Traditionally, scaling laws have been derived under the assumption
of collision-dominated thermal conduction. Here we examine the impact of
different regimes of thermal conduction -- collision-dominated,
turbulence-dominated, and free-streaming -- on the form of the scaling laws
relating the loop temperature and heating rate to its pressure and half-length.
We show that the scaling laws for turbulence-dominated conduction are
fundamentally different than those for collision-dominated and free-streaming
conduction, inasmuch as the form of the scaling laws now depend primarily on
conditions at the low-temperature, rather than high-temperature, part of the
loop. We also establish regimes in temperature and density space in which each
of the applicable scaling laws prevail.

cases with different values of Born-Infeld parameter b, where the black hole
systems can have no phase transition, reentrant phase transition, or Van der
Waals-like phase transition. For these different cases, we obtain the
corresponding phase structures in pressure-temperature diagram and
temperature-specific volume diagram. The tiny differences between these cases
are clearly displayed. On the other hand, the radius rps and the minimal impact
parameter ups of the photon sphere are calculated via the effective potential
of the radial motion of photons. For different cases, rps and ups are found to
have different behaviors. In particular, with the increase of rps or ups, the
temperature possesses a decrease-increase-decrease-increase behavior for fixed
pressure if there exists the reentrant phase transition. While for fixed
temperature, the pressure will show an increase-decrease-increase-decrease
behavior instead. These behaviors are quite different from that of the Van der
Waals-like phase transition. Near the critical point, the changes of rps and

determine the atomic mass of $^{89}$Y and $^{139}$La, from which $\beta$-decay
$Q$-values for $^{89}$Sr and $^{139}$Ba were obtained to determine if there
could be an ultra-low $Q$-value decay branch in the $\beta$-decay of $^{89}$Sr

alternative to standard linkage methods used in hierarchical clustering.
Minimax linkage relies on distances to a prototype for each cluster; this
prototype can be thought of as a representative object in the cluster, hence
improving the interpretability of clustering results. Bien and Tibshirani
analyzed properties of this method in 2011 [2], popularizing the method within
the statistics community. Additionally, they performed comparisons of minimax
linkage to standard linkage methods, making use of five data sets and two
different evaluation metrics (distance to prototype and misclassification
rate). In an effort to expand upon their work and evaluate minimax linkage more
comprehensively, our benchmark study focuses on thorough method evaluation via
multiple performance metrics on several well-described data sets. We also make
all code and data publicly available through an R package, for full
reproducibility. Similarly to [2], we find that minimax linkage often produces
the smallest maximum minimax radius of all linkage methods, meaning that
minimax linkage produces clusters where objects in a cluster are tightly
clustered around their prototype. This is true across a range of values for the
total number of clusters (k). However, this is not always the case, and special
attention should be paid to the case when k is the true known value. For true
k, minimax linkage does not always perform the best in terms of all the
evaluation metrics studied, including maximum minimax radius. This paper was
motivated by the IFCS Cluster Benchmarking Task Force's call for clustering
benchmark studies and the white paper [5], which put forth guidelines and
principles for comprehensive benchmarking in clustering. Our work is designed
to be a neutral benchmark study of minimax linkage.

key problem in practice since missing values almost always occur in knowledge
acquisition due to the error of data measuring, the limitation of data
collection, or the limitation of data comprehension, etc. An incomplete
information system is mainly processed by compressing the indiscernibility
relation. The existing rough set extension models based on tolerance or
symmetric similarity relations typically discard one relation among the
reflexive, symmetric and transitive relations, especially the transitive
relation. In order to overcome the limitations of the current rough set
extension models, we define a new relation called the positive transitive
relation and then propose a novel rough set extension model built upon which.
The new model holds the merit of the existing rough set extension models while
avoids their limitations of discarding transitivity or symmetry. In comparison
to the existing extension models, the proposed model has a better performance
in processing the incomplete information systems while substantially reducing
the computational complexity, taking into account the relation of tolerance and
similarity of positive transitivity, and supplementing the related theories in
accordance to the intuitive classification of incomplete information. In
summary, the positive transitive relation can improve current theoretical
analysis of incomplete information systems and the newly proposed extension
model is more suitable for processing incomplete information systems and has a
broad application prospect.

show that this dependency is much stronger than previously assumed. In fact, we

that an argument analysis system that relies more on discourse context than the

privacy is a major concern in interactive record linkage. MINDFIRL supports
interactive record linkage while minimizing the privacy risk by (1) using
pseudonyms to separate the identifying information from the sensitive

incrementally, as needed on-demand at the point of decision, and (3) quantifies

Here we consider the problem of domain generalization, when a model is trained
once, and its performance generalizes to unseen domains. Intuitively, within a
specific medical imaging modality the domain differences are smaller relative
to natural images domain variability. We rethink data augmentation for medical
3D images and propose a deep stacked transformations (DST) approach for domain
generalization. Specifically, a series of n stacked transformations are applied
to each image in each mini-batch during network training to account for the
contribution of domain-specific shifts in medical images. We comprehensively
evaluate our method on three tasks: segmentation of whole prostate from 3D MRI,
left atrial from 3D MRI, and left ventricle from 3D ultrasound. We demonstrate
that when trained on a small source dataset, (i) on average, DST models on
unseen datasets degrade only by 11% (Dice score change), compared to the
conventional augmentation (degrading 39%) and CycleGAN-based domain adaptation
method (degrading 25%); (ii) when evaluation on the same domain, DST is also
better albeit only marginally. (iii) When training on large-sized data, DST on
unseen domains reaches performance of state-of-the-art fully supervised models.

recognition models leverage motion information either explicitly by using
optical flow as input or implicitly by means of 3D convolutional filters that
simultaneously capture appearance and motion information. This paper proposes
an alternative approach based on a learnable correlation operator that can be
used to establish frame-toframe matches over convolutional feature maps in the
different layers of the network. The proposed architecture enables the fusion
of this explicit temporal matching information with traditional appearance cues
captured by 2D convolution. Our correlation network compares favorably with
widely-used 3D CNNs for video modeling, and achieves competitive results over
the prominent two-stream network while being much faster to train. We
empirically demonstrate that correlation networks produce strong results on a
variety of video datasets, and outperform the state of the art on four popular
benchmarks for action recognition: Kinetics, Something-Something, Diving48 and
Sports1M.

time-dependent emission from active region NOAA 1158 as observed by SDO/AIA for
low-, intermediate-, and high-frequency nanoflares. In each pixel of our
predicted multi-wavelength, time-dependent images, we compute two commonly-used
diagnostics: the emission measure slope and the time lag. We find that
signatures of the heating frequency persist in both of these diagnostics. In
particular, our results show that the distribution of emission measure slopes
narrows and the mean decreases with decreasing heating frequency and that the
range of emission measure slopes is consistent with past observational and
modeling work. Furthermore, we find that the time lag becomes increasingly
spatially coherent with decreasing heating frequency while the distribution of
time lags across the whole active region becomes more broad with increasing
heating frequency. In a follow up paper, we train a random forest classifier on
these predicted diagnostics and use this model to classify real AIA
observations of NOAA 1158 in terms of the underlying heating frequency.

successes in continuous spaces. However, they have not been successfully
applied to model text sequences. While decreasing the energy at training
samples is straightforward, mining (negative) samples where the energy should
be increased is difficult. In part, this is because standard gradient-based
methods are not readily applicable when the input is high-dimensional and
discrete. Here, we side-step this issue by generating negatives using
pre-trained auto-regressive language models. The EBM then works in the residual
of the language model; and is trained to discriminate real text from text
generated by the auto-regressive models. We investigate the generalization
ability of residual EBMs, a pre-requisite for using them in other applications.
We extensively analyze generalization for the task of classifying whether an
input is machine or human generated, a natural task given the training loss and
how we mine negatives. Overall, we observe that EBMs can generalize remarkably
well to changes in the architecture of the generators producing negatives.
However, EBMs exhibit more sensitivity to the training set used by such
generators.

device developments. Second-harmonic (SH) microscopy allows for the
non-invasive visualization and analysis of ferroelectric domain structures and
walls. While the technique is well understood in bulk lithium niobate, SH

resonant enhancements, which depend on film thicknesses and the substrate
materials. We present a comprehensive analysis of SH microscopy in x-cut
lithium niobate thin films, based on a full three dimensional focus

dominant signal in back-reflection originates from a co-propagating
phase-matched process observed through reflections, rather than direct
detection of the counter-propagating signal as in bulk samples. We can explain
the observation of domain structures in the thin film geometry, and in

unambiguously distinguish areas, which are completely or only partly inverted

meta-training is more complicated when targeting a more general set of noise

Here we report an experimental synthesis of non-Abelian gauge fields in real

classical waves and classical fluxes. Based on optical mode degeneracy, we
break time-reversal symmetry in different manners---via temporal modulation and
the Faraday effect---to synthesize tunable non-Abelian gauge fields. The Sagnac
interference of two final states, obtained by reversely-ordered path integrals,
demonstrates the non-commutativity of the gauge fields. Our work introduces
real-space building blocks for non-Abelian gauge fields, relevant for classical

convection in which a rigorous upper bound on the Nusselt number, $Nu$, is
sought as a function of the Rayleigh number $Ra$. Concentrating on the

heat equation as a constraint for the bound using a novel 2-dimensional
background approach thereby complementing the `wall-to-wall' approach of
Hassanzadeh \etal \,(\emph{J. Fluid Mech.} \textbf{751}, 627-662, 2014).
Imposing the same symmetry on the problem, we find correspondence with their
result for $Ra \leq Ra_c:=4468.8$ but, beyond that, the optimal fields
complexify to produce a higher bound. This bound approaches that by a
1-dimensional background field as the length of computational domain
$L\rightarrow\infty$. On lifting the imposed symmetry, the optimal
2-dimensional temperature background field reverts back to being 1-dimensional
giving the best bound $Nu\le 0.055Ra^{1/2}$ compared to $Nu \le 0.026Ra^{1/2}$

imposing the full time-averaged Boussinesq equations as constraints (by
introducing 2-dimensional temperature {\em and} velocity background fields) is
also unable to lower this bound. This then exhausts the background approach for
the 2-dimensional (and by extension 3-dimensional) Rayleigh-Benard problem with
the bound remaining stubbornly $Ra^{1/2}$ while data seems more to scale like
$Ra^{1/3}$ for large $Ra$. % Finally, we show that adding a velocity background
field to the formulation of Wen \etal\, (\emph{Phys. Rev. E.} \textbf{92},

a plausible and interesting possibility is that the Higgs sector is extended

the SM sector. Combined with the LEP excess in $e^+e^-\to Z(h\to b\bar b)$, the
diphoton excess around 96 GeV recently reported by CMS may suggest such a
possibility. We examine if those LEP and CMS excesses can be explained
simultaneously by a singlet-like Higgs boson in the general next-to-minimal
supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). Higgs mixing in the NMSSM relies on the
singlet coupling to the MSSM Higgs doublets and the higgsino mass parameter,
and thus is subject to the constraints on these supersymmetric parameters. We
find that the NMSSM can account for both the LEP and CMS excesses at 96 GeV
while accommodating the observed 125 GeV SM-like Higgs boson. Interestingly,
the required mixing angles constrain the heavy doublet Higgs boson to be
heavier than about 500 GeV. We also show that the viable region of mixing
parameter space is considerably modified if the higgsino mass parameter is
around the weak scale, mainly because of the Higgs coupling to photons induced

polarized submillimeter emission measurements is typically parameterized as
$p\propto I^{-\alpha}$ $(\alpha \leq 1)$, and used to infer dust grain
alignment efficiency in star-forming regions, with an index $\alpha=1$
indicating near-total lack of alignment of grains with the magnetic field. In
this work we demonstrate that the non-Gaussian noise characteristics of
polarization fraction may produce apparent measurements of $\alpha \sim 1$ even
in data with significant signal-to-noise in Stokes $Q$, $U$ and $I$ emission,
and so with robust measurements of polarization angle. We present a simple
model demonstrating this behavior, and propose a criterion by which
well-characterized measurements of polarization fraction may be identified. We
demonstrate that where our model is applicable, $\alpha$ can be recovered by
fitting the $p-I$ relationship with the mean of the Rice distribution, without
statistical debiasing of polarization fraction. We apply our model to JCMT
BISTRO Survey POL-2 850$\mu$m observations of three clumps in the Ophiuchus
Molecular Cloud, finding that in the externally-illuminated Oph A region,
$\alpha\approx 0.34$, while in the more isolated Oph B and C, despite their
differing star formation histories, $\alpha \sim 0.6-0.7$. Our results thus
suggest that dust grain alignment in dense gas is more strongly influenced by
incident interstellar radiation field than by star formation history. We
further find that grains may remain aligned with the magnetic field at
significantly higher gas densities than has previously been believed, thus
allowing investigation of magnetic field properties within star-forming clumps
and cores.

evaluation (OPE) -- the problem of evaluating a new policy using the historical
data obtained by different behavior policies -- under the model of
nonstationary episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDP) with a long horizon and
a large action space. Existing importance sampling (IS) methods often suffer
from large variance that depends exponentially on the RL horizon $H$. To solve
this problem, we consider a marginalized importance sampling (MIS) estimator
that recursively estimates the state marginal distribution for the target
policy at every step. MIS achieves a mean-squared error of $$ \frac{1}{n}
\sum\nolimits_{t=1}^H\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\left[\frac{d_t^\pi(s_t)^2}{d_t^\mu(s_t)^2}

$V_{t+1}^\pi$ is the value function of the MDP under $\pi$. The result matches
the Cramer-Rao lower bound in \citet{jiang2016doubly} up to a multiplicative
factor of $H$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first OPE estimation
error bound with a polynomial dependence on $H$. Besides theory, we show
empirical superiority of our method in time-varying, partially observable, and
long-horizon RL environments.

of natural-sounding prior samples. For multi-speaker models, Capacitron is able
to preserve target speaker identity during inter-speaker prosody transfer and
when drawing samples from the latent prior. Lastly, we introduce a method for
decomposing embedding capacity hierarchically across two sets of latents,

states. However, individual quantum-dots (QDs) rarely exhibit such telegraphic
signal, and yet, the vast majority of single-NC blinking data are analyzed
using a single fixed threshold, which generates binary trajectories. Further,
blinking dynamics can vary dramatically over NCs in the ensemble, and it is
unclear whether the exponents (m) of single-particle On-/Off-time distributions
(P(t)-On/Off), which are used to validate mechanistic models of blinking, are
narrowly distributed or not. Here, we sub-classify an ensemble based on the
emissivity of QDs, and subsequently compare the (sub)ensemble behaviors. To
achieve this, we analyzed a large number (>1000) of intensity trajectories for
a model system, Mn+2 doped ZnCdS QDs, which exhibits diverse blinking dynamics.
An intensity histogram dependent thresholding method allowed us to construct
distributions of relevant blinking parameters (such as m). Interestingly, we
find that single QD P(t)-On/Off s follow either truncated power law or power
law, and their relative proportion vary over sub-populations. Our results
reveal a remarkable variation in m(On/Off) amongst as well as within
sub-ensembles, which implies multiple blinking mechanisms being operational
among various QDs. We further show that the m(On/Off) obtained via cumulative
single-particle P(t)-On/Off is clearly distinct from the weighted mean value of
all single-particle m(On/Off), an evidence for the lack of ergodicity. Thus,
investigation and analyses of a large number of QDs, albeit for a limited

separate pair of photodetectors, behind a diffractive network, and the class

of optical systems, we reduced the signal coupling between the positive and
negative detectors of each class by dividing their optical path into two
jointly-trained diffractive neural networks that work in parallel. We further
made use of this parallelization approach, and divided individual classes among
multiple jointly-trained differential diffractive neural networks. Using this
class-specific differential detection in jointly-optimized diffractive

  The author of this project has chosen two popular programming languages for
data science -- R and Python -- for implementing traffic data wrangling

Interfaces), which can be used for integrating the services into another

services inside Taverna components -- this made the services usable via an
easy-to-use GUI (Graphical User Interface) provided by Taverna Workbench, which
is a program suitable for carrying out data wrangling tasks. This also enables
reuse of the components in other workflows.
  The data wrangling components were tested and validated by using them for two

filled valence bands is considered to be well-established by the Peierls
theorem, which associates the distortion with the formation of a band gap and a
subsequent gain in energy. Employing modern total energy methods on the test
cases of lithium, sodium and carbon chains, we reveal that the distortion is
not universal, but conditional upon the balance between distorting and
stabilizing forces. Furthermore, in all systems studied, the electrostatic
interactions between the electrons and ions act as the main driving force for
distortion, rather than the electron band lowering at the Fermi level as is
commonly believed. The main stabilizing force which drives the chains toward
their symmetric arrangement is derived from the electronic kinetic energy. Both
forces are affected by the external conditions, e.g. stress, and consequently
the instability of one-dimensional nanowires is conditional upon them. This
brings a new perspective to the field of one-dimensional metals, and may shed
new light on the distortion of more complex structures.

challenging tasks in this area is to identify fake and real news in early

time gap and maximizing accuracy. Despite recent efforts in detection of fake
news, there has been no significant work that explicitly incorporates early

playing role in issues like dark matter, dark energy, and in some cosmological
problems. In the current article we investigate one known exactly solvable
model of three-dimensional statistical-mechanical model of relativistic Bose
gas that takes into account the existence of both particles and antiparticles.
We derive exact expressions for the behavior of the Casimir force for the
system subjected to film geometry under periodic boundary conditions. We show
that the Casimir force between the plates is attractive, monotonic as a
function of the temperature scaling variable, with a scaling function that
approaches at low temperatures a universal negative constant equal to the
corresponding one for two-component three dimensional Gaussian system. The
force decays with the distance in a power law near and below the bulk critical
temperature $T_c$ of the Bose condensate and exponentially above $T_c$. We
obtain closed form exact expression for the Casimir amplitude $\Delta_{\rm
Cas}^{\rm RBG} =-4\zeta(3)/(5\pi)$. We establish the precise correspondence of
the scaling function of the free energy of the model with the scaling functions
of two other well-known models of statistical mechanics - the spherical model
and the imperfect Bose gas model.

Those reactions that occur in these domains can be affected by the tunneling

fragmentation process where parity odd fragmentation functions are introduced.
We present the fragmentation functions by decomposing the quark-quark

the images and the dynamic spectrum in order to enhance the fibers. For the
study of the background continuum emission we used images averaged over several
seconds. Results: All fibers in the SAO dynamic spectra are identifiable in the
NRH images. Fibers were first detected after the primary energy release in a
moving type IV, probably associated with the rapid eastward expansion of the
flare and the postflare loop arcade. They appeared as a 10% modulation of the
continuum intensity. The fibers and the continuum were strongly circularly
polarized in the ordinary mode sense, indicating fundamental plasma emission.
We detected discrete fiber sources along two ~300, Mm long parallel stripes,
apparently segments of large scale loops encompassing both the EUV loops and
the flux rope. We found multiple fiber emissions at slightly different
positions and times; their consecutive appearance can give the impression of
apparent motion with supra-luminal velocities. Images of individual fibers were
very similar at 432.0 and 327.0 MHz. From the position shift of the sources and
the time delays at low and high frequencies we estimated, for a well observed
group of fibers, the exciter speed and the frequency scale length along the
loops; we obtained consistent values from imaging and spectral data, supporting
the whistler origin of the fiber emission. The fibers in absorption and in
emission are very similar as manifestations of the same wave train.

patterns and spreading phenomena, in terms of the susceptible-infected-removed
(SIR) model on the modified activity-driven temporal network (ADTN) with
memory. In particular, we focus on how the epidemic threshold of the SIR model
is affected by the heterogeneity of nodal activities and the memory strength in
temporal and static regimes, respectively. While strong ties (memory) between
nodes inhibit the spread of epidemic to be localized, the heterogeneity of
nodal activities enhances it to be globalized initially. Since the epidemic
threshold of the SIR model is very sensitive to the degree distribution of
nodes in static networks, we test the SIR model on the modified ADTNs with the
possible set of the activity exponents and the memory exponents that generates
the same degree distributions in temporal networks. We also discuss the role of
spatiotemporal scaling properties of the largest cluster and the maximum degree
in the epidemic threshold. It is observed that the presence of highly active
nodes enables to trigger the initial spread of epidemic in a short period of
time, but it also limits its final spread to the entire network. This implies
that there is the trade-off between the spreading time of epidemic and its
outbreak size. Finally, we suggest the phase diagram of the SIR model on ADTNs
and the optimal condition for the spread of epidemic under the circumstances.

attention from both academia and industry since it can reduce the costs in
fixing bugs. However, how to assess the patch correctness remains to be an open
challenge. Two widely adopted ways to approach this challenge, including
manually checking and validating using automated generated tests, are biased
(i.e., suffering from subjectivity and low precision respectively). Aim: To
address this concern, we propose to conduct an empirical study towards
understanding the correct patches that are generated by existing
state-of-the-art APR techniques, aiming at providing guidelines for future
assessment of patches. Method: To this end, we first present a Literature
Review (LR) on the reported correct patches generated by recent techniques on
the Defects4J benchmark and collect 177 correct patches after a process of
sanity check. We investigate how these machine-generated correct patches
achieve semantic equivalence, but syntactic difference compared with
developer-provided ones, how these patches distribute in different projects and
APR techniques, and how the characteristics of a bug affect the patches
generated for it. Results: Our main findings include 1) we do not need to fix
bugs exactly like how developers do since we observe that 25.4% (45/177) of the
correct patches generated by APR techniques are syntactically different from
developer-provided ones; 2) the distribution of machine-generated correct
patches diverges for the aspects of Defects4J projects and APR techniques; and
3) APR techniques tend to generate patches that are different from those by
developers for bugs with large patch sizes. Conclusion: Our study not only
verifies the conclusions from previous studies but also highlights implications
for future study towards assessing patch correctness.

account for similarities, which is not ideal as dot product is not metric
learning, so it does not convey the important inequality property. Based on
this observation, we propose three novel deep learning approaches that utilize
Mahalanobis distance. Our first approach uses user-playlist-song interactions,
and combines Mahalanobis distance scores between (i) a target user and a target
song, and (ii) between a target playlist and the target song to account for
both the user's preference and the playlist's theme. Our second approach
measures song-song similarities by considering Mahalanobis distance scores
between the target song and each member song (i.e., existing song) in the
target playlist. The contribution of each distance score is measured by our
proposed memory metric-based attention mechanism. In the third approach, we
fuse the two previous models into a unified model to further enhance their
performance. In addition, we adopt and customize Adversarial Personalized

superior to non-symplectic ones especially in long-time computation, when

Concerning that the linear stochastic oscillator is one of the typical

G\""artner--Ellis theorem, we first study the large deviations principles of the
mean position and the mean velocity for both the exact solution and its
numerical approximations. Then, we prove that stochastic symplectic methods
asymptotically preserve these two large deviations principles, but
non-symplectic ones do not. This indicates that stochastic symplectic methods
are able to approximate well the exponential decay speed of the ""hitting

oscillator. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result about using
large deviations principle to show the superiority of stochastic symplectic

enable collaboration among distributed agents at low cost and high flexibility.
When many agents need to transmit information over the same wireless network,
communication becomes a shared and contested resource. Event-triggered and
self-triggered control account for this by transmitting data only when needed,
enabling significant energy savings. However, a solution that brings those
benefits to multi-hop networks and can reallocate freed up bandwidth to
additional agents or data sources is still missing. To fill this gap, we
propose control-guided communication, a novel co-design approach for
distributed self-triggered control over wireless multi-hop networks. The
control system informs the communication system of its transmission demands
ahead of time, and the communication system allocates resources accordingly.
Experiments on a cyber-physical testbed show that multiple cart-poles can be
synchronized over wireless, while serving other traffic when resources are
available, or saving energy. These experiments are the first to demonstrate and
evaluate distributed self-triggered control over low-power multi-hop wireless
networks at update rates of tens of milliseconds.

using density functional based structure search methods combined with BCS type

at and above 200 GPa pressures. The existence of a series of these phases in
the La H system was subsequently confirmed experimentally, and techniques were
developed for their syntheses and characterization, including measurements of
structural and transport properties, at megabar pressures. Four probe
electrical transport measurements of a cubic phase identified as LaH10 display
signatures of superconductivity at temperatures above 260 K near 200 GPa. The
results are supported by pseudo four probe conductivity measurements, critical

classes of surface Helmholtz free energies, the corresponding surface entropy
production mechanisms. By establishing the constitutive relations that
guarantee that the surface entropy production is non-negative, we identify a
new class of boundary conditions, which on one hand generalizes in a nontrivial
manner the Navier's slip boundary conditions, and on the other hand describes
dynamic and static contact angle conditions. We explore the general model in

falsely detected nodule candidates by tracking the appearance changes in
continuous CT slices of each nodule candidate. The proposed framework is

immiscible incompressible two-phase flow between different rock types. We
develop for this problem two robust schemes based on domain decomposition (DD)
methods and operator-splitting techniques. The first scheme follows a
sequential procedure in which the (global) pressure, the saturation-advection
and the saturation-diffusion problems are fully decoupled. In this scheme, each
problem is treated individually using various DD approaches and specialized
numerical methods. The coupling between the different problems is explicit and
the time-marching is with no iterations. To adapt to different time scales of
problem components and different rock types, the novel scheme uses a multirate
time stepping strategy, by taking multiple finer time steps for
saturation-advection within one coarse time step for saturation-diffusion and
pressure, and permits independent time steps for the advection step in the
different rocks. In the second scheme, we review the classical Implicit
Pressure--Explicit Saturation (IMPES) method (by decoupling only pressure and
saturation) in the context of multirate coupling schemes and
nonconforming-in-time DD approaches. For the discretization, the
saturation-advection problem is approximated with the explicit Euler method in
time, and in space with the cell-centered finite volume method of first order
of Godunov type. The saturation-diffusion problem is approximated in time with
the implicit Euler method and in space with the mixed finite element method, as
in the pressure problem. Finally, in a series of numerical experiments, we
investigate the practicality of the proposed schemes, the accuracy-in-time of
the multirate and nonconforming time strategies, and compare the convergence of
various DD methods within each approach.

distributions, with the goal of a small Wasserstein distance (or other optimal
transport costs). The approach is based on two principles: (a) if the source
randomness of the network is a continuous distribution (the ""semi-discrete""
setting), then the Wasserstein distance is realized by a deterministic optimal
transport mapping; (b) given an optimal transport mapping between a generator
network and a target distribution, the Wasserstein distance may be decreased
via a regression between the generated data and the mapped target points. The
procedure here therefore alternates these two steps, forming an optimal
transport and regressing against it, gradually adjusting the generator network
towards the target distribution. Mathematically, this approach is shown to
minimize the Wasserstein distance to both the empirical target distribution,
and also its underlying population counterpart. Empirically, good performance
is demonstrated on the training and testing sets of the MNIST and Thin-8 data.
The paper closes with a discussion of the unsuitability of the Wasserstein
distance for certain tasks, as has been identified in prior work [Arora et al.,

results show that up-slab fluid flow directions produce a flux peak of CO$_2$

sourced from hydrated slab mantle enhances decarbonation or carbonation at
lithological interfaces, increases slab surface fluxes, and redistributes
CO$_2$ from basalt and gabbro layers to the overlying sedimentary layer. As a
result, removal of the cap sediments (by diapirism or off-scraping) leads to
elevated slab surface CO$_2$ and H$_2$O fluxes. The modelled subduction

accuracy is not always achievable, recent work on Bayesian deep networks shows

what DNNs do not know is desirable to increase the safety of deep learning
technology in sensitive applications. Bayesian neural networks attempt to
address this challenge. However, traditional approaches are computationally
intractable and do not scale well to large, complex neural network

Bayesian inference for DNNs by imposing a Bernoulli distribution on the model

solution allow the existence of an accelerated expansion of the universe at
late times, after the domination era of the viscous pressure, which holds
without the need of including a cosmological constant. Nevertheless, the fitted
parameter values lead to drawbacks as a very large non-adiabatic contribution
to the speed of sound, and some inconsistencies, not totally conclusive, with
the description of the dissipative dark matter as a fluid, which is
nevertheless a common feature of these kind of models.

Here, we analyze the feasibility of using trunk sway data and machine learning

assessments outside of the clinic. We recruited sixteen participants to perform
standing balance exercises. For each exercise, we recorded trunk sway data and
had a PT rate balance performance on a scale of 1 to 5. The rating scale was
adapted from the Functional Independence Measure. From the trunk sway data, we
extracted a 61-dimensional feature vector representing performance of each

machine (SVM) to map trunk sway features to PT ratings. Evaluated in a
leave-one-participant-out scheme, the model achieved a classification accuracy
of 82%. Compared to participant self-assessment ratings, the SVM outputs were
significantly closer to PT ratings. The results of this pilot study suggest
that in the absence of PTs, ML techniques can provide accurate assessments

sources for Einstein's field equations for the gravitational metric, and on the
definition of the Cauchy-Noether energy-momentum tensor of relativistic field
theories, the natural source of Einstein's equation. The paper opens with a
brief review of the development of an idea first advanced by Maupertui (1741):
the Dynamical Action Principle. The story reached a turning point with the
creation of Einstein's theory of General Relativity. The associated work of
Noether served as an inspiration for particle physics for 100 years. The
discovery of gravity waves (LIGO 2016) showed that Gravity is a phenomenon akin
to, and part of, particle physics, to be treated as a canonical field theory,
and eventually quantized. Here the subject is the theory of the classical
metric field in interaction with extended distributions of matter.We determine
a class of Noetherian field theories that provide extended sources for
Einstein's equations and action integrals for classical hydrodynamics. The
intimate relationship between hydrodynamics and General Relativity is
emphasized. Results: The 2-form gauge theory of Ogievetskij and Polubarinov
(1964) makes a crucial contribution to the matter source of gravity. Multiple,
unexpected roles are played by `permittivities'. There is a unique,
relativistic hydrodynamics with 4 degrees of freedom that includes vorticity,
the equation of continuity and a generalization of the Bernoulli equation. It
is based on an action principle and it reduces, in the non relativistic limit,
to a simple generalization of Lagrange theory of 1760, with just one free
parameter..

particles. Although this process has been studied extensively, there are still
open questions about both the fundamental physics and the reconciliation of
different observations into a coherent quantitative view of this important
mechanism for particle-turbulence interaction. In this work, we study the
effect of projecting this phenomenon onto 2D and 1D (as usually done in
experiments). In particular, the effect of measurement volume in 1D projections
on detected cluster properties, such as size or concentration, is explored to
provide a method for comparison of published/future observations, from
experimental or numerical data. The results demonstrate that, in order to
capture accurate values of the mean cluster properties under a wide range of
experimental conditions, the measurement volume needs to be larger than the
Kolmogorov length scale, and smaller than about ten percent of the integral
length scale of the turbulence. This dependency provides the correct scaling to
carry out 1D measurements of preferential concentration, considering the
turbulence characteristics. It is also critical to disentangle the
cluster-characterizing results from random contributions to the cluster
statistics, especially in 1D, as the raw probability density function of
Voronoi cells does not provide error-free information on the clusters size or
local concentration. We propose a methodology to correct for this measurement
bias, with an analytical model of the cluster PDF obtained from comparison with
a Random Poisson Process probability distribution in 1D, which appears to
discard the existence of power laws in the cluster PDF. We develop a new test
to discern between turbulence-driven clustering and randomness, that
complements the cluster identification algorithm by segregating the number of
particles inside each cluster.

image registration tasks. In such models, the transformation of interest is
parameterized by a fixed set of basis functions as for example B-splines. Each
basis function is located on a fixed regular grid position among the image
domain, because the transformation of interest is not known in advance. As a
consequence, not all basis functions will necessarily contribute to the final
transformation which results in a non-compact representation of the
transformation. We reformulate the pairwise registration problem as a recursive
sequence of successive alignments. For each element in the sequence, a local
deformation defined by its position, shape, and weight is computed by our
recurrent registration neural network. The sum of all local deformations yield
the final spatial alignment of both images. Formulating the registration
problem in this way allows the network to detect non-aligned regions in the
images and to learn how to locally refine the registration properly. In
contrast to current non-sequence-based registration methods, our approach
iteratively applies local spatial deformations to the images until the desired
registration accuracy is achieved. We trained our network on 2D magnetic
resonance images of the lung and compared our method to a standard parametric
B-spline registration. The experiments show, that our method performs on par
for the accuracy but yields a more compact representation of the
transformation. Furthermore, we achieve a speedup of around 15 compared to the
B-spline registration.

various image classification problems. These commonly used CNN models usually
use the same activation function, such as RELU, for all neurons in the

always be optimal. Thus, a ""Multi-function CNN"" (MCNN), which uses different
activation functions for different neurons, has been shown to outperform a
SCNN. Also, CNNs typically have very large architectures that use a lot of
memory and need a lot of data in order to be trained well. As a result, they
tend to have very high training and prediction times too. An important research
problem is how to automatically and efficiently find the best CNN with both
high classification performance and compact architecture with high training and
prediction speeds, small power usage, and small memory size for any image
classification problem. It is very useful to intelligently find an effective,
fast, energy-efficient, and memory-efficient ""Compressed Multi-function CNN""
(CMCNN) from a large number of candidate MCNNs. A new compensatory algorithm
using a new genetic algorithm (GA) is created to find the best CMCNN with an
ideal compensation between performance and architecture size. The optimal CMCNN
has the best performance and the smallest architecture size. Simulations using
the CIFAR10 dataset showed that the new compensatory algorithm could find
CMCNNs that could outperform non-compressed MCNNs in terms of classification
