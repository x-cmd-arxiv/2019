vortices in a type-II superconductor, consisting of superimposed six- and
12-fold anisotropies. Using numerical simulations we study how the vortex
lattice configuration varies as the magnitudes of the two anisotropic
interaction terms change. A triangular lattice appears for all values, and
rotates through 30 degrees as the ratio of the six- and 12-fold anisotropy
amplitudes is varied. The transition causes the VL to split into domains that
have rotated clockwise or counter-clockwise, with domain boundaries that are
""decorated"" by dislocations consisting of five- and seven-fold coordinated
vortices. We also find intra-domain dislocations and defects, and characterize
them in terms of their energy cost. We discuss how this model could be
generalized to other particle-based systems with anisotropic interactions, such
as colloids, and consider the limit of very large anisotropy where it is
possible to create cluster crystal states.

In this paper, we present CRISLoc, the first CSI fingerprinting

operates in a completely passive mode, overhearing thepackets on-the-fly for
his own CSI acquisition. The smartphone CSI is sanitized via calibrating the

altered APs with a joint clustering and outlier detection method to find them.
A novel transferlearning approach is proposed to reconstruct the

proposed to pinpoint the location of a smartphone. Our studyreveals important

scaled cubicly with the injected helicity. We can related this to increase of

that does not explicitly rely on the RTE is proposed for radiative heat
transfer in the densely packed particulate system. The new approach is based on
the generalization of the concept of radiation distribution factor (RD) at

as the continuum scale physical parameter that characterize the radiative

regularly distributed particulate system is shown to be anisotropic. The
continuum approach is verified by using heat transfer simulation at the

alternative continuum theory, which will help the analysis and understanding of

noise and use a Bayesian approach to find their regularised solution. We focus
on mildly ill-posed inverse problems with the noise being generalised
derivative of fractional Brownian motion, using a novel wavelet - based
approach we call vaguelette-vaguelette. It allows us to apply sequence space
methods without assuming that all operators are simultaneously diagonalisable.
The results are proved for more general bases and covariance operators.
  Our primary aim is to study the posterior contraction rate in such inverse
problems over Sobolev classes of true functions, comparing it to the derived
minimax rate. Secondly, we study the effect of plugging in a consistent
estimator of variances in sequence space on the posterior contraction rate, for
instance where there are repeated observations. This result is also applied to
the problem where the forward operator is observed with error. Thirdly, we show
that an adaptive empirical Bayes posterior distribution contracts at the
optimal rate, in the minimax sense, under a condition on prior smoothness, with
a plugged in maximum marginal likelihood estimator of the prior scale. These
theoretical results are illustrated on simulated data.

numerous previous results in the base dimension $1$. This follows from our main
result, a metric version of Kawamata's canonical bundle formula: the $L^2$
metric carries the singularity described by the discriminant divisor and the
moduli part line bundle has a singular hermitian metric with vanishing Lelong
numbers. This answers a question of Eriksson, Freixas i Montplet and
Mourougane. It has immediate applications to $L^2$ extension theorems which was
our starting point.
  We also strengthen the celebrated semipositivity theorems due to Fujita,
Kawamata and others for log Calabi-Yau fibrations, giving an entirely new
simpler proof which does not use technical results from the theory of variation
of Hodge structure. Instead, in the proof of our main result, together with the
analysis of plurisubharmonic singularities, we use a special case of the
positivity of direct images. The fact that this can replace the use of Hodge
theory in the semipositivity theorems answers a question of Berndtsson.

nonlinear effects come through the beam's inextensibility---local arc length
preservation---rather than traditional extensible effects attributed to fully
restricted boundary conditions. Enforcing inextensibility leads to: nonlinear
stiffness terms, which appear as quasilinear and semilinear effects, as well as
nonlinear inertia effects, appearing as nonlocal terms that make the beam
implicit in the acceleration.
  In this paper we discuss the derivation of the equations of motion via
Hamilton's principle with a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the effective
inextensibility constraint. We then provide the functional framework for weak
and strong solutions before presenting novel results on the existence and
uniqueness of strong solutions. A distinguishing feature is that the two types
of nonlinear terms prevent independent challenges: the quasilinear nature of
the stiffness forces higher topologies for solutions, while the nonlocal
inertia requires the consideration of Kelvin-Voigt type damping to close
estimates. Finally, a modal approach is used to produce mathematically-oriented
numerical simulations that provide insight to the features and limitations of
the inextensible model.

networks (GANs) is to use some form of gradient penalty on the discriminator.
This gradient penalty was originally motivated by a Wasserstein distance

not well motivated. We present a unifying framework of expected margin
maximization and show that a wide range of gradient-penalized GANs (e.g.,
Wasserstein, Standard, Least-Squares, and Hinge GANs) can be derived from this
framework. Our results imply that employing gradient penalties induces a
large-margin classifier (thus, a large-margin discriminator in GANs). We
describe how expected margin maximization helps reduce vanishing gradients at
fake (generated) samples, a known problem in GANs. From this framework, we
derive a new $L^\infty$ gradient norm penalty with Hinge loss which generally
produces equally good (or better) generated output in GANs than $L^2$-norm
penalties (based on the Fr\'echet Inception Distance).

due to the difficulty in analyzing the sensitivity of objective functions that
are typically used to train deep neural networks. Many existing methods resort
to the stochastic gradient descent algorithm and apply a pre-defined
sensitivity to the gradients for privatizing weights. However, their slow
convergence typically yields a high cumulative privacy loss. Here, we take a
different route by employing the method of auxiliary coordinates, which allows
us to independently update the weights per layer by optimizing a per-layer
objective function. This objective function can be well approximated by a
low-order Taylor's expansion, in which sensitivity analysis becomes tractable.
We perturb the coefficients of the expansion for privacy, which we optimize
using more advanced optimization routines than SGD for faster convergence. We
empirically show that our algorithm provides a decent trained model quality
under a modest privacy budget.

have been partly due to radiation from high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs).
Previous investigations on the effect of metallicity have used galaxies of
different types. To isolate the effects of metallicity on the production of
HMXBs, we study a sample consisting only of 46 blue compact dwarf galaxies
(BCDs) covering metallicity in the range 12+log(O/H) of 7.15 to 8.66. To test
the hypothesis of metallicity dependence in the X-ray luminosity function
(XLF), we fix the XLF form to that found for near-solar metallicity galaxies
and use a Bayesian method to constrain the XLF normalization as a function of
star formation rate (SFR) for three different metallicity ranges in our sample.
We find an increase by a factor of 4.45 $\pm$ 2.04 in the XLF normalization
between the metallicity ranges 7.1-7.7 and 8.2-8.66 at a statistical
significance of 99.79 per cent. Our results suggest that HMXB production is
enhanced at low metallicity, and consequently that HMXBs may have contributed
significantly to the reheating of the early Universe.

proposed to help overcome the self-interested cheating that is individually
optimal in the Prisoners' Dilemma game. These mechanisms include assortative or
networked social interactions, other-regarding preferences considering the
payoffs of others, reciprocity rules to establish cooperation as a social norm,
and multilevel selection involving simultaneous competition between individuals
favoring cheaters and competition between groups favoring cooperators. In this
paper, we build on recent work studying PDE replicator equations for multilevel
selection to understand how within-group mechanisms of assortment,
other-regarding preferences, and both direct and indirect reciprocity can help
to facilitate cooperation in concert with evolutionary competition between
groups. We consider a group-structured population in which interactions between
individuals consist of Prisoners' Dilemma games, and study the dynamics of
multilevel competition determined by the payoffs individuals receive when
interacting according to these within-group mechanisms. We find that the
presence of each of these mechanisms acts synergistically with multilevel
selection for the promotion of cooperation, decreasing the strength of
between-group competition required to sustain long-time cooperation and
increasing the collective payoff achieved by the population. However, we find
that only other-regarding preferences allows for the achievement of socially
optimal collective payoffs for Prisoners' Dilemma games in which average payoff
is maximized by an intermediate mix of cooperators and defectors. For the other
three mechanisms, the multilevel dynamics remain susceptible to a shadow of
lower-level selection, as the collective outcome fails to exceed the payoff of
the all-cooperator group.

fail to recognize highly predictive localized effects in favour of weakly
predictive global patterns. This is a problem because localized effects are
critical to developing individualized policies and treatment plans in
applications ranging from precision medicine to advertising. To address this
challenge, we propose to estimate sample-specific models that tailor inference
and prediction at the individual level. In contrast to classical ML models that
estimate a single, complex model (or only a few complex models), our approach
produces a model personalized to each sample. These sample-specific models can
be studied to understand subgroup dynamics that go beyond coarse-grained class
labels. Crucially, our approach does not assume that relationships between
samples (e.g. a similarity network) are known a priori. Instead, we use
unmodeled covariates to learn a latent distance metric over the samples. We
apply this approach to financial, biomedical, and electoral data as well as
simulated data and show that sample-specific models provide fine-grained
interpretations of complicated phenomena without sacrificing predictive
accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models such as deep neural networks.

\textit{local elasticity}. Roughly speaking, a classifier is said to be locally
elastic if its prediction at a feature vector $\bx'$ is \textit{not}
significantly perturbed, after the classifier is updated via stochastic
gradient descent at a (labeled) feature vector $\bx$ that is
\textit{dissimilar} to $\bx'$ in a certain sense. This phenomenon is shown to
persist for neural networks with nonlinear activation functions through
extensive simulations on real-life and synthetic datasets, whereas this is not
observed in linear classifiers. In addition, we offer a geometric
interpretation of local elasticity using the neural tangent kernel
\citep{jacot2018neural}. Building on top of local elasticity, we obtain
pairwise similarity measures between feature vectors, which can be used for
clustering in conjunction with $K$-means. The effectiveness of the clustering
algorithm on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets in turn corroborates the
hypothesis of local elasticity of neural networks on real-life data. Finally,
we discuss some implications of local elasticity to shed light on several
intriguing aspects of deep neural networks.

Neutrino Observatory (IceCube) at the geographic South Pole. An array of IceAct

a powerful tool in IceCube-Gen2 for distinguishing astrophysical neutrinos from
the dominant backgrounds of cosmic-ray induced atmospheric muons and neutrinos:
the IceTop array is already in place as part of IceCube, but has a high energy
threshold. Although the duty cycle will be lower for the IceAct telescopes than
the present IceTop tanks, the IceAct telescopes may prove to be more effective
at lowering the detection threshold for air showers. Additionally, small
imaging air-Cherenkov telescopes in combination with IceTop, the deep IceCube
detector or other future detector systems might improve measurements of the
composition of the cosmic ray energy spectrum. In this paper we present
measurements of a first 7-pixel imaging air Cherenkov telescope demonstrator,

challenges that the FCC-experiments have to tackle are the very large number of
pile-up events of around 1000 and the data processing, namely the reduction of
the huge data rate of 1-2 PBytes/s whilst keeping the signal efficiencies of
interesting processes high. Therefore, smart triggering concepts are needed
that not only allow for a significant reduction of pile-up and rate but also
provide high signal acceptance and purity. In this proceeding, one such concept
of a triplet track trigger based on Monolithic ActivePixel Sensors (MAPS) is
presented for a generic detector geometry. It is demonstrated that the triplet
pixel layer design allows for a very simple and fast track reconstruction
already at the first trigger level, providing excellent track reconstruction
efficiencies and very high purity at the same time. Based on a full Geant4
simulation tracking performance studies are presented for a full-scale triplet
pixel detector, i.e. three closely spaced pixel layers at a sufficiently large
radius, in an FCC-like detector environment. Results obtained for different
triplet layer design parameters are compared.

Concretely, the paper has two main contributions: a generic scheme to
approximate functions with the NTK by sampling from transport mappings between
the initial weights and their desired values, and the construction of transport
mappings via Fourier transforms. Regarding the first contribution, the proof
scheme provides another perspective on how the NTK regime arises from
rescaling: redundancy in the weights due to resampling allows individual
weights to be scaled down. Regarding the second contribution, the most notable
transport mapping asserts that roughly $1 / \delta^{10d}$ nodes are sufficient
to approximate continuous functions, where $\delta$ depends on the continuity
properties of the target function. By contrast, nearly the same proof yields a
bound of $1 / \delta^{2d}$ for shallow ReLU networks; this gap suggests a
tantalizing direction for future work, separating shallow ReLU networks and
their linearization.

only if they admit the same number of homomorphisms from any graph [Acta Math.
Hungar. 18 (1967), pp. 321--328]. In this work we prove that two graphs are
quantum isomorphic (in the commuting operator framework) if and only if they
admit the same number of homomorphisms from any planar graph. As there exist
pairs of non-isomorphic graphs that are quantum isomorphic, this implies that
homomorphism counts from planar graphs do not determine a graph up to
isomorphism. Another immediate consequence is that determining whether there
exists some planar graph that has a different number of homomorphisms to two
given graphs is an undecidable problem, since quantum isomorphism is known to
be undecidable. Our characterization of quantum isomorphism is proven via a
combinatorial characterization of the intertwiner spaces of the quantum
automorphism group of a graph based on counting homomorphisms from planar
graphs. This result inspires the definition of ""graph categories"" which are
analogous to, and a generalization of, partition categories that are the basis
of the definition of easy quantum groups. Thus we introduce a new class of
""graph-theoretic quantum groups"" whose intertwiner spaces are spanned by maps
associated to (bi-labeled) graphs. Finally, we use our result on quantum
isomorphism to prove an interesting reformulation of the Four Color Theorem:
that any planar graph is 4-colorable if and only if it has a homomorphism to a
specific Cayley graph on the symmetric group $S_4$ which contains a complete
subgraph on four vertices but is not 4-colorable.

right segmentation within individual images and associates segments with the

therefore to maximize the similarity within segments and minimize the

performed consistently by extracting pixel-wise embeddings and clustering, with
the semantic label determined by the majority vote of its nearest neighbors

Additionally, our approach produces more precise boundaries and consistent

formation history of this region. The bulk of its stars formed at least eight
billion years ago. This initial activity was followed by a long period of
quiescence that was ended by an outstanding event about 1 Gyr ago, during which
roughly 5% of its mass formed in a time window $\sim$100 Myr, in what may
arguably have been one of the most energetic events in the history of the Milky

percent of the stellar mass in the past $\sim$500 Myr, with an increased rate
up to $\sim$30 Myr ago. Our findings contradict the previously accepted
paradigm of quasi-continuous star formation at the centre of the Milky Way. The
long quiescent phase agrees with the overall quiescent history of the Milky Way

gas transport through the bar was extremely inefficient during a long stretch

also been reported albeit with poor statistics. On the other hand, evidence of
a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF) in high-z starburst galaxies has been

abundance of bright high-z sub-mm galaxies than expected for a universal
Chabrier IMF. Exploiting our physical model for high-z proto-spheroidal

somewhat top-heavier than Chabrier. Such IMF is consistent with that recently

which the observed explosion energy ($\sim 10^{51}$ ergs) is reached in a
timescale of $\gtrsim1$ second. It is, however, unclear whether such a slow
explosion is consistent with observations. In this work, by performing nuclear
reaction network calculations for a range of the explosion timescale $t_{\rm

diagnostics on the explosion timescale. We employ one-dimensional hydrodynamic
and nucleosynthesis simulations above the proto-neutron star core, by
parameterizing the nature of the explosion mechanism by $t_{\rm grow}$. The
results are then compared to various observational constraints; the masses of
$^{56}$Ni derived for typical CCSNe, the masses of $^{57}$Ni and $^{44}$Ti
observed for SN 1987A, and the abundance patterns observed in extremely
metal-poor stars. We find that these observational constraints are consistent
with the `rapid' explosion ($t_{\rm grow} \lesssim 250$ ms), and especially the
best match is found for a nearly instantaneous explosion ($t_{\rm grow}
\lesssim 50$ ms). Our finding places a strong constraint on the explosion
mechanism; the slow mechanism ($t_{\rm grow} \gtrsim 1000$ ms) would not

cosmological zoom simulations from the E-MOSAICS project. We find that a median
of $2.3$ and $0.3$ per cent of the mass in halo field stars formed in clusters

$10^5~M_{\odot}$, respectively, with the $25$-$75$th percentiles spanning
$1.9$-$3.0$ and $0.2$-$0.5$ per cent being caused by differences in the
assembly histories of the host galaxies. Under the extreme assumption that no
stellar cluster survives to the present day, the mass fractions increase to a
median of $5.9$ and $1.8$ per cent. These small fractions indicate that the
disruption of GCs plays a sub-dominant role in the build-up of the stellar
halo. We also determine the contributed halo mass fraction that would present
signatures of light-element abundance variations considered to be unique to
GCs, and find that clusters and GCs would contribute a median of $1.1$ and
$0.2$ per cent, respectively. We estimate the contributed fraction of GC stars

clusters. However, this paradigm is inconsistent with recent results, both
theoretical and observational, that instead favour a hierarchical picture of
star formation in which stars are formed across a continuous distribution of
gas densities and most OB associations never were bound clusters. Instead they
are formed in-situ as the low-density side of this distribution, rather than as
the remnants of expanding clusters. We utilise the second $Gaia$ data release
to quantify the degree to which OB associations are undergoing expansion and,
therefore, whether OB associations are the product of expanding clusters, or
whether they were born in-situ, as the large-scale, globally-unbound
associations that we see today. We find that the observed kinematic properties
of associations are consistent with highly substructured velocity fields and
additionally require some degree of localised expansion from sub-clusters
within the association. While most present-day OB associations do exhibit low
levels of expansion, there is no significant correlation between radial
velocity and radius. Therefore, the large-scale structure of associations is
not set by the expansion of clusters, rather it is a relic of the molecular gas
cloud from which the association was formed. This finding is inconsistent with
a monolithic model of association formation and instead favours a hierarchical
model, in which OB associations form in-situ, following the fractal structure
of the gas from which they form.

these galaxies have average inverse SFR/$M_{\star}$ of $\approx$100 Myr. The

by combining the modelled masses with previously obtained spectroscopic
measurements of metallicity from [O III] $\lambda$4363 detections. Here, we
include measurements for 79 galaxies from the Metal Abundances across Cosmic

shape of the $z\approx0.8$ mass-metallicity relation, a steep rise in
metallicity at low stellar masses, transitioning to a plateau at higher masses,
is consistent with $z\sim0.1$ studies. We also compare the evolution in
metallicity between $z\approx0.8$ and $z\sim0.1$ against recent strong-line
diagnostic studies at intermediate redshifts and find good agreement.
Specifically, we find that lower mass galaxies ($4\times10^8$ $M_{\odot}$)
built up their metal content 1.6 times more rapidly than higher mass galaxies

${\sim}10^{-3}\rm\ M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}$ in stellar winds, only a negligible
fraction of this material ($<10^{-4}$) ends up being accreted onto Sgr A*. The
recent discovery of cold gas (${\sim}10^4\rm\ K$) in its vicinity raised
questions about how such material could settle in the hostile (${\sim}10^7\rm\
K$) environment near Sgr A*. In this work we show that the system of
mass-losing stars blowing winds can naturally account for both the hot,
inefficient accretion flow, as well as the formation of a cold disk-like
structure. We run hydrodynamical simulations using the grid-based code Ramses
starting as early in the past as possible to observe the state of the system at
the present time. Our results show that the system reaches a quasi-steady state
in about ${\sim}500\rm\ yr$ with material being captured at a rate of
${\sim}10^{-6}\rm\ M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}$ at scales of ${\sim}10^{-4}\rm\ pc$,
consistent with the observations and previous models. However, on longer
timescales ($\gtrsim3000\rm\ yr$) the material accumulates close to the black
hole in the form of a disk. Considering the duration of the Wolf-Rayet phase
(${\sim}10^5\rm\ yr$), we conclude that this scenario likely has already
happened, and could be responsible for the more active past of Sgr A*, and/or
its current outflow. We argue that the hypothesis of the mass-losing stars
being the main regulator of the activity of the black hole deserves further
consideration.

for indirect detection of axions or other ultralight fields. The superradiant
instability associated with a rapidly spinning black hole leads to the creation
of an axion cloud which carries energy and angular momentum from the black
hole. This cloud will then decay via gravitational wave emission. We show that
the energy lost as a result of this process tends toward an outspiraling of the
binary orbit. A given binary system is sensitive to a narrow range of axion
masses, determined by the mass of the black hole. Pulsar-black hole binaries,
once detected in the electromagnetic band, will allow high-precision
measurements of black hole mass loss via timing measurements of the companion
pulsar. This avenue of investigation is particularly promising in light of the
recent preliminary announcements of two candidate black hole-neutron star
mergers by LIGO/VIRGO (#S190814bv and #S190426c). We demonstrate that for such
a binary system with a typical millisecond pulsar and a 3-solar-mass black
hole, axions with masses between $2.7 \times 10^{-12}$ eV and $3.2 \times
10^{-12}$ eV are detectable. Recent gravitational wave observations by
LIGO/VIRGO of binary black hole mergers imply that, for these binaries,
gravitational radiation from the rotating quadrupole moment is a dominant
effect, causing an inspiraling orbit. With some reasonable assumptions about
the period of the binary when it formed and the spins of the black holes, these
observations rule out possible axion masses between $3 \times 10^{-13}$ eV and
$6 \times 10^{-13}$ eV. Future binary black hole observations, for example by
LISA, are expected to provide more robust bounds. In some circumstances,
neutron stars may also undergo superradiant instabilities, and binary pulsars
could be used to exclude axions with certain masses and matter couplings.

power-law fluence distributions of FRB 121102, we propose an elementary model
for the FRB luminosity function of individual repeaters with an inversion
protocol which directly relates the power-law distribution index of magnetar
short burst fluences to that for FRBs. The protocol indicates the FRB energy
scales virtually linearly with crust/field dislocation amplitude, if magnetar
short bursts prevail in the magnetoelastic regime. Charge starvation in the
magnetosphere during bursts (required in WT19) for individual repeaters implies
the predicted burst fluence distribution is narrow, $\lesssim 3$ decades for
yielding strains and oscillation frequencies feasible in magnetar crusts.
Requiring magnetic confinement and charge starvation, we obtain a death line
for FRBs which segregates magnetars from the normal pulsar population,
suggesting only the former will host recurrent FRBs. We convolve the burst
energy distribution for individual magnetars to define the distribution of
luminosities in evolved magnetar populations. The broken power-law luminosity
function's low energy character depends on the population model, while the high
energy index traces that of individual repeaters. Independent of the evolved
population, the broken power-law isotropic-equivalent energy/luminosity
function peaks at $\sim10^{37}-10^{40}$ erg with a low-energy cutoff at $\sim
10^{37}$ erg. Lastly, we consider the local fluence distribution of FRBs, and
find that it can constrain the subset of FRB-producing magnetar progenitors.
Our model suggests that improvements in sensitivity may reveal flattening of
the global FRB fluence distribution and saturation in FRB rates.

shepherding of large grains by either hidden, still-forming planets within the

underlying mechanisms driving the evolution of the disk, the presence of
embedded planets and characterising the transportation of material within the

the chemically-inert midplane, or detailing the required removal of angular

of gas in upper disk layers in the disk of HD 163296 as traced by 12CO

addition, a persistent radial outflow is seen at the outer edge of the disk,

evolve rapidly between z~2.5 and z~1, but remain roughly constant below z~1.
This result implies that the sizes of both star-forming and quiescent galaxies
increase much more slowly than previous studies found using half-light radii.
The half-mass radius evolution of quiescent galaxies is fully consistent with a
model which uses observed minor merger rates to predict the increase in sizes
due to the accretion of small galaxies. Progenitor bias may still contribute to
the growth of quiescent galaxies, particularly if we assume a slower timescale
for the minor merger growth model. The slower half-mass radius evolution of
star-forming galaxies is in tension with cosmological simulations and
semi-analytic galaxy models. Further detailed, consistent comparisons with
simulations are required to place these results in context.

$\sigma_\mathrm{e}\propto M_*^{\beta}(1+z)^{\zeta}$, with $\beta\simeq 0.18$

scatter of the $M_*$-$\sigma_\mathrm{e}$ relation is $\simeq0.08$ dex in

redshift dependence of the normalisation ($\zeta\simeq 0.5$) and weaker
redshift dependence of the slope (${\rm d} \beta/{\rm d} \log (1+z)\simeq
0.18$) when $\beta$ varies with time. At $z=2$ ETGs with $M_*\approx

Hence, there is demand for an autonomous cinematographer that can reason about

condensed matter physics. Inspired by experimental efforts, we study
interfacial processes between two slabs of BiSbTeSe2 (BSTS) via first
principles calculations. Topological surface states are absent for the BSTS
interface at its equilibrium separation, but our calculations show that they
appear if the inter-slab distance is greater than 6 Ang. More importantly, we
find that topological interface states can be preserved by inserting two or
more layers of hexagonal boron nitride between the two BSTS slabs. In
experiments, the electric current tunneling through the interface is
insensitive to back gate voltage when the bias voltage is small. Using a
first-principles based method that allows us to simulate gate field, we show
that at low bias the extra charge induced by a gate voltage resides on the
surface that is closest to the gate electrode, leaving the interface almost
undoped. This provides clues to understand the origin of the observed
insensitivity of transport properties to back voltage at low bias. Our study
resolves a few questions raised in experiment, which does not yet offer a clear

optimal algorithms for this problem do not exploit the linear structure in an

when exploration-free methods are effective. Indeed, if the distribution of

it automatically detects the nice case. Numerical results demonstrate
significant regret reductions by our method relative to several baselines.

Submitted to Journal of Fluids Engineering",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a method to visualize vortex cores based on manipulation of the
pressure field produced by isolated vortices in incompressible flow. Under
ideal conditions the function $D=2|\nabla P|/\nabla^2 P$ yields an approximate
distance to vortex centerlines. As opposed to local methods to identify
coherent structures, isosurfaces of $D$ produce a field of vortex tubes
equidistant to the vortex core center which, ideally, are independent of vortex
intensity or size. In contrast to other line-vortex identification methods,
which typically rely on algorithms to detect vortex core lines and frequently
need complex implementations, the proposed method can be computed from the
local Eulerian velocity and pressure fields as easily as vortex identification
methods such as the $Q$ and $\lambda_2$ criteria. $2|\nabla P|/\nabla^2 P$
results in the exact distance to the core center for a Rankine vortex and is in
general valid for the region of a vortex where there is pure rotation, yielding
an approximation to the distance farther from the core in other simple
one-dimensional vortex models. The methodology performs well in all tests we
attempted, though limitations are presented and discussed. The method is
demonstrated for a canonical Burgers vortex, a Bodewadt vortex, homogeneous
isotropic turbulent flow, the wake of a propeller, a heaving plate, a turning
containership and the airwake of a surface combatant. The proposed method helps
to better visualize vortical flow fields by displaying vortex cores,
complementing methods like $Q$ and $\lambda_2$ which display vortical volumes.

It is shown that due to the spin-orbit interaction it is in general impossible
to find a basis of atomic states for which the crossed transition dipole moment
vanishes. The parametric electric polarizability of the Kramers two-level
system for a definite ground-state is generically nonreciprocal. I apply the
developed formalism to study Casimir-Polder forces and torques when the

the two-level system when both the atom and the reciprocal substrate have
symmetry of revolution about some axis. Surprisingly, it is found that when
chiral-type dipole transitions are dominant the stable ground state is not the
one in which the symmetry axes of the atom and substrate are aligned. The
reason is that the rotational symmetry may be spontaneously broken by the
quantum vacuum fluctuations, so that the ground state has less symmetry than

temperatures warm enough for sustained open water lake conditions due to the
low solar energy input available at that time. We incrementally test the
existence of open water conditions using energy balance calculations for the
global, regional, and seasonal temperatures, and we assess if the preservation
of liquid water was possible under perennial ice covers. We found scenarios
where lacustrine conditions are preserved in a cold climate, where the resupply
of water by the inflow of rivers and high precipitation rates are substituted
by an abutting glacier. For equatorial temperatures as low as 240K-255K, the
ice thickness ranges from 3-10 m, a value comparable to the range of those for
the perennially ice-covered lakes in Antarctica (3-6 m). The ice-covered lake
hypothesis is a compelling way to decouple the mineralogy and the climate by
limiting the gas exchanges between the sediment and the CO2 atmosphere, and it
eliminates the requirement for global mean temperatures above the freezing
point. Not only do ice-covered lakes provide a baseline for exploring the range

data is the difference-in-differences (DiD) model. In this work, we consider an
extension of the classical DiD setting to the hierarchical context in which
data cannot be matched at the most granular level (e.g., individual-level
differences are unobservable). We propose a Bayesian hierarchical
difference-in-differences (HDiD) model which estimates the treatment effect by
regressing the treatment on a latent variable representing the mean change in
group-level outcome. We present theoretical and empirical results showing that
an HDiD model that fails to adjust for a particular class of confounding
variables, or confounding with the baseline (pre-treatment) outcomes, biases
the treatment effect estimate. We propose and implement various approaches to
perform variable selection using a structured Bayesian spike-and-slab model in
the HDiD context. Our proposed methods leverage the temporal structure within
the DiD context to select those covariates that lead to unbiased and efficient
estimation of the causal treatment effect. We evaluate the methods' properties
through theoretical results and simulation, and we use them to assess the
impact of primary care redesign of clinics in Minnesota on the management of

probabilistic counting is used as an anonymization technique that provides a

probabilistic counting by considering its use for preserving user anonymity,
developing application guidelines and including hash collisions in the
estimate. Our work complements previous method by attempting to explore the
causes of the deviation of uncorrected estimate from the real value. The

to produce in the lab. Here, we demonstrate that any simple droplet dripper, in
which millimetric droplets are created by letting them drip under gravity from
a hollow needle, is readily turned into a versatile droplet generator capable
of producing drops smaller than the needle diameter. This is achieved by
vibrating the needle base at a frequency close to a flexing resonance of the
needle tube. Through high-speed imaging and detailed image analysis we show
that the droplets flung off one-by-one from the needle tip are uniform in size.
The produced drop size is mainly set by the driving frequency and is
practically independent of needle geometry or driving amplitude, making the
generator robust and easily tunable. Like for a simple dripper, the drop
ejection rate is independently controlled through the flow-rate. Since the
needle diameter can be much larger than the produced drop size, clogging is not
an issue. By using needles with different resonant frequencies we could produce
droplets with radii anywhere between 100 microns to 1 mm with a high
reproducibility (the production of smaller drops is possible in principle). We
propose a mass-spring model for the vibrated pendant drop that captures all our
observations.

show that the Kondo effect takes place at low temperatures, regardless the

decouples from the MZMs such that the residual impurity entropy can show local

and identify mergers. However, this technique relies on using an appropriate
set of training data to be successful. By combining hydrodynamical simulations,
synthetic observations and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we
quantitatively assess how realistic simulated galaxy images must be in order to
reliably classify mergers. Specifically, we compare the performance of CNNs
trained with two types of galaxy images, stellar maps and dust-inclusive
radiatively transferred images, each with three levels of observational
realism: (1) no observational effects (idealized images), (2) realistic sky and
point spread function (semi-realistic images), (3) insertion into a real sky
image (fully realistic images). We find that networks trained on either
idealized or semi-real images have poor performance when applied to
survey-realistic images. In contrast, networks trained on fully realistic
images achieve 87.1% classification performance. Importantly, the level of
realism in the training images is much more important than whether the images
included radiative transfer, or simply used the stellar maps (87.1% compared to
79.6% accuracy, respectively). Therefore, one can avoid the large computational
and storage cost of running radiative transfer with a relatively modest
compromise in classification performance. Making photometry-based networks
insensitive to colour incurs a very mild penalty to performance with
survey-realistic data (86.0% with r-only compared to 87.1% with gri). This
result demonstrates that while colour can be exploited by colour-sensitive
networks, it is not necessary to achieve high accuracy and so can be avoided if
desired. We provide the public release of our statistical observational realism

economic performance of smart grids have been applied with the presence of
different players making decisions in these grids. This paper proposes a
bi-level hierarchical structure for designing and planning distributed energy
resources in home microgrids (H-MGs). Such a small-scale grid inside the market
environment permits energy exchange among distributed energy resources and home
microgrids through a pool market. In this paper, each home microgrid's planner
maximizes the performance of distributed energy resources while exchanging
energy with other H-MGs. The problem is formulated as a high-level problem
decomposed into a set of low-level market clearing problems. The global optimal
performance in terms of energy cost is met for a market structure (H-MGs,
consumers, and retailers) at a Nash optimum point for the formulated scheduling
game considering local and general constraints on the spot market. In general,
the upper-level structure is based on H-MG generation competition for
maximizing their individual and/or group income in the process of forming
coalition with other H-MGs. In addition, the functionality of the lower-level
of the hierarchical structure is governed by a market clearing based on the
price response method by all the DERs enabling H-MGs to change the spot market
strategic behavior. Prices are obtained as dual variables of power balance
equations. This paper will investigate a set of bilevel games, including
nonlinear programming problems solved through a complementary problem method.
Using the binary theory, the bilevel hierarchical structure will be replanned
using a nonlinear problem. Results prove that the proposed structure can
increase the players's profit.

characterization of galaxies near and far. Whereas applying it to galaxies with
a genuine SL luminosity distribution yields a robust determination of the
S\'ersic exponent eta and effective surface brightness $\mu_{\rm eff}$, this is
not necessarily the case for galaxies whose surface brightness profiles (SBPs)
appreciably deviate from the SL (eg, early-type galaxies with a depleted core
and nucleated dwarf ellipticals, or most late-type galaxies-LTGs). In this
general case of ""imperfect"" SL profiles, the best-fitting solution may
significantly depend on the radius (or surface brightness) interval fit and
corrections for point spread function (PSF) convolution effects. Such
uncertainties may then affect, in a non-easily predictable manner, automated
structural studies of galaxies. We present a fitting concept (iFIT) that
permits a robust determination of the equivalent SL model for the general case
of galaxies with imperfect SL profiles. iFIT has been extensively tested on
synthetic data with a S\'ersic index 0.3<${\eta}$<4.2 and an effective radius
1<$\rm{R}_{eff}$ (arcs)<20. Applied to non PSF-convolved data, iFIT can infer
the S\'ersic exponent eta with an absolute error of <0.2 even for shallow SBPs.
As for PSF-degraded data, iFIT can recover the input SL model parameters with a
satisfactorily accuracy almost over the entire considered parameter space as
long as FWHM(PSF)<$\rm{R}_{eff}$. Tests indicate that iFIT shows little
sensitivity on PSF corrections and the SBP limiting surface brightness, and
that subtraction of the best-fitting SL model in two different bands yields a
good match to the observed radial color profile. The publicly available iFIT
offers an efficient tool for the non-supervised structural characterization of
large galaxy samples, as those expected to become available with Euclid and

Schrodinger and Klein- Gordon equations, the energy levels and wave functions
are obtained from NU method. We obtain a first order equation in terms of E for
the Schrodinger equation and a fourth-order equation in terms of ER for the
Klein-Gordon equation. Therefore, the obtained equation from the Klein-Gordon
equation has both the real solutions and imaginary solutions that we consider
only the real solutions for this equation. For more accuracy, the spin-orbit
and tensor potentials are added to the central potential as the perturbed terms
and the first-order correction value of the energy levels is calculated. These
energy levels are used for 24Mg nucleus and the good results are obtained in
agreement with the experimental data. Of course, one can see that the

  SCALPEL3 focuses on scalability, easy interactive analysis and helpers for
data flow analysis to accelerate studies performed on LODs. It consists of
three open-source libraries based on Apache Spark. SCALPEL-Flattening allows
denormalization of the LOD (only SNDS for now) by joining tables sequentially
in a big table. SCALPEL-Extraction provides fast concept extraction from a big
table such as the one produced by SCALPEL-Flattening. Finally, SCALPEL-Analysis
allows interactive cohort manipulations, monitoring statistics of cohort flows
and building datasets to be used with machine learning libraries. The first two
provide a Scala API while the last one provides a Python API that can be used
in an interactive environment. Our code is available on GitHub.
  SCALPEL3 allowed to extract successfully complex concepts for studies such as
Morel et al (2017) or studies with 14.5 million patients observed over three
years (corresponding to more than 15 billion healthcare events and roughly 15
TeraBytes of data) in less than 49 minutes on a small 15 nodes HDFS cluster.
SCALPEL3 provides a sharp interactive control of data processing through
legible code, which helps to build studies with full reproducibility, leading
to improved maintainability and audit of studies performed on LODs.

a multilayer CNN that plays the role of a critic scoring the quality of

knee MRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed unpaired training enables
diagnostic-quality reconstruction when high-quality image labels are not

from poor performance for slots which often encounter large semantic
variability in slot values after deployment (e.g. message texts, partial

utterance via substring matching can partly improve performance, it often
produces incorrect input. Moreover, such techniques cannot delexicalize slots
with out-of-vocabulary slot values not seen at training. In this paper, we
propose a novel iterative delexicalization algorithm, which can accurately
delexicalize the input, even with out-of-vocabulary slot values. Based on model
confidence of the current delexicalized input, our algorithm improves
delexicalization in every iteration to converge to the best input having the

hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules seen in a wide variety of astrophysical regions is
often accompanied by a series of weak satellite bands at ~3.4-3.6 $\mu$m. One
of these sources, IRAS 21282+5050, a planetary nebula, also exhibits a weak
band at ~1.68 $\mu$m. While the satellite features at ~3.4-3.6 $\mu$m are often
attributed to the anharmonicities of PAHs, it is not clear whether overtones or
combination bands dominate the 1.68 $\mu$m feature.
  Aims. In this work, we examine the anharmonic spectra of eight PAH molecules,
including anthracene, tetracene, pentacene, phenanthrene, chrysene,
benz[a]anthracene, pyrene, and perylene, to explore the origin of the infrared
bands in the 1.6-1.7 $\mu$m waveelngth region.
  Methods. Density Functional Theory (DFT) in combination with the vibrational
second-order perturbation theory (VPT2) is utilized for computing the
anharmonic spectra of PAHs. To simulate the vibrational excitation process of
PAHs, the Wang-Landau random walk technique is employed.
  Results. All the dominant bands in the 1.6-1.7 $\mu$m wavelength range and in
the 3.1-3.5 $\mu$m C-H stretching region are calculated and tabulated. It is
demonstrated that combination bands dominate the 1.6-1.7 $\mu$m region, while
overtones are rare and weak in this region. We also calculate the intensity
ratios of the 3.1-3.5 $\mu$m C-H stretching features to the bands in the
1.6-1.7 $\mu$m region, $I_{3.1-3.5}/I_{1.6-1.7}$, for both ground and
vibrationally excited states. On average, we obtain $\langle
I_{3.1-3.5}/I_{1.6-1.7} \rangle$ $\approx$ 12.6 and $\langle
I_{3.1-3.5}/I_{1.6-1.7} \rangle$ $\approx$ 17.6 for PAHs at ground states and

well known that dense subgraphs can have strong correlation with structures of
interest in real-world networks across various domains ranging from social
networks to biological systems [Gionis and Tsourakakis `15].
  For the densest subgraph problem, Charikar's greedy algorithm [Asashiro `00,
Charikar `00] is very simple, and can typically find result of quality much
better than the provable factor 2-approximation, which makes it very popular in
practice. However, it is also known to give suboptimal output in many
real-world examples. On the other hand, finding the exact optimal solution
requires the computation of maximum flow. Despite the existence of highly
optimized maximum flow solvers, such computation still incurs prohibitive
computational costs for the massive graphs arising in modern data science
applications.
  We devise an iterative algorithm which naturally generalizes the greedy
algorithm of Charikar. Our algorithm draws insights from the iterative
approaches from convex optimization, and also exploits the dual interpretation
of the densest subgraph problem. We have empirical evidence that our algorithm
is much more robust against the structural heterogeneities in real-world
datasets, and converges to the optimal subgraph density even when the simple
greedy algorithm fails. On the other hand, in instances where Charikar's
algorithm performs well, our algorithm is able to quickly verify its
optimality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is significantly faster
than the maximum flow based exact optimal algorithm. We conduct experiments on
datasets from broad domains, and our algorithm achieves $\sim$145$\times$
speedup on average to find subgraphs whose density is at least 90\% of the
optimal value.

itself well to emulation. By removing the need to identify halos and subhalos,

wide dynamic range. The RFMS incorporates an RF-field-free atomic reference and
a laser-frequency tracker to ensure reliability and accuracy of the RF
measurement. We characterize the RFP and measure polar field and polarization
patterns of the RFP at 12.6 GHz RF in the far-field of a standard gain horn
antenna. Measurements at 2.5 GHz are also performed. Measured patterns are in
good agreement with simulations. A detailed calibration procedure and
uncertainty analysis are presented that account for deviations from an
isotropic response over a $4\pi$ solid angle, arising from dielectric
structures external to the atomic measurement volume. Contributions to the
measurement uncertainty from the fundamental atomic measurement method and
associated analysis as well as material, geometry, and hardware design choices
are accounted for. A calibration (C) factor is used to establish
absolute-standard SI-traceable calibration of the RFP. Pulsed and modulated RF
field measurement, and time-domain RF-pulse waveform imaging are also
demonstrated.

that the resulting dataset would allow to study them via statistical means, as
well as prove that they constitute gravitationally bound 2+2 quadruple system.
Methods: We analysed photometric data for eclipsing binaries provided by the
OGLE survey in the LMC fields. We found a large number of new doubly eclipsing
systems (our discoveries are 3x more numerous than previous studies). With a
typical orbital period of days for the binaries, we sought eclipse time
variations (ETVs) on the timescale of years. In the cases where we were able to
detect the ETV period, the difference between the inner and outer periods in
the quadruple system is large enough. This allows us to interpret ETVs
primarily as the light-time effect, thus providing an interesting constraint on
masses of the binaries. Results: In addition to significantly enlarging the
database of known doubly eclipsing systems, we performed a thorough analysis of
72 cases. ETVs for 28 of them (39% of the studied cases) showed evidence of
relative motion. We note OGLE BLG-ECL-145467 as the most interesting case; it
is bright (I=12.6 mag), consists of two detached binaries with periods of about
3.3 d and 4.9 d (making it a candidate for a 3:2 resonant system), mutual
period about 1538 d. Distribution of the orbital period ratio P_A/P_B of
binaries in 2+2 quadruples shows statistically significant excess at 1 and 1.5.
The former is likely a natural statistical preference in weakly interacting
systems with periods within the same range. The latter is thought to be
evidence of a capture in the 3:2 mean motion resonance of the two binaries.
This sets important constraints on evolutionary channels in these systems. The
total number of doubly eclipsing systems increased to 146, more than 90% of
which are at low declinations on the southern sky.

on the accurate characterization of their redshift distributions using only
broadband imaging, and can be very sensitive to incomplete or biased priors
used for redshift calibration. S\'anchez & Bernstein (2019) presented a
hierarchical Bayesian model which estimates those from the robust combination
of prior information, photometry of single galaxies and the information
contained in the galaxy clustering against a well-characterized tracer
population. In this work, we extend the method so that it can be applied to
real data, developing some necessary new extensions to it, especially in the
treatment of galaxy clustering information, and we test it on realistic
simulations. After marginalizing over the mapping between the clustering
estimator and the actual density distribution of the sample galaxies, and using
prior information from a small patch of the survey, we find the incorporation
of clustering information with photo-$z$'s to tighten the redshift posteriors,
and to overcome biases in the prior that mimic those happening in spectroscopic
samples. The method presented here uses all the information at hand to reduce
prior biases and incompleteness. Even in cases where we artificially bias the
spectroscopic sample to induce a shift in mean redshift of $\Delta \bar z
\approx 0.05,$ the final biases in the posterior are $\Delta \bar z
\lesssim0.003.$ This robustness to flaws in the redshift prior or training
samples would constitute a milestone for the control of redshift systematic
uncertainties in future weak lensing analyses.

provide some meaningful information to constrain the nature of SNe Ia. Here, I
show strong evidence that the SNe Ia with strong CaII infrared triple (CaII

Gluon
radiation by a heavy quark originated from a hard process, ceases shortly on a

radiates only a small fraction of its energy. This is why the measured
fragmentation function D(z) peaks at large z. Hadronization finishes at very
short distances, well shorter than 1 fm, by production of a colorless
small-size Qq-bar dipole. This ensures dominance of a perturbative mechanism
and makes possible factorization of short and long distances. The latter
corresponds to final state interactions of the produced dipole propagating
through a dense medium. The results provide good description of data on beauty
and charm suppression in heavy ion collisions, fixing the transport coefficient
for b-quarks about twice smaller than for charm, and both significantly lower

enterprises increasingly seek to extract insights for decision making from text
data sets. Processing large text data sets can be computationally expensive,
however, especially if it involves sophisticated algorithms. This challenge is
exacerbated when it is desirable to run different types of queries against a
data set, making it expensive to build multiple indices to speed up query
processing. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a framework called EmApprox
that uses approximation to speed up the processing of a wide range of queries
over large text data sets. The key insight is that different types of queries
can be approximated by processing subsets of data that are most similar to the
queries. EmApprox builds a general index for a data set by learning a natural
language processing model, producing a set of highly compressed vectors
representing words and subcollections of documents. Then, at query processing
time, EmApprox uses the index to guide sampling of the data set, with the
probability of selecting each subcollection of documents being proportional to
its {\em similarity} to the query as computed using the vector representations.
We have implemented a prototype of EmApprox as an extension of the Apache Spark
system, and used it to approximate three types of queries: aggregation,
information retrieval, and recommendation. Experimental results show that
EmApprox's similarity-guided sampling achieves much better accuracy than random
sampling. Further, EmApprox can achieve significant speedups if users can
tolerate small amounts of inaccuracies. For example, when sampling at 10\%,
EmApprox speeds up a set of queries counting phrase occurrences by almost 10x
while achieving estimated relative errors of less than 22\% for 90\% of the
queries.

lines, and so are their intra-night detections. Therefore, the Hough transform,
a line detecting algorithm, can be used to connect the line-up detections to
find asteroids. We applied this algorithm to a high-cadence Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1)
observation, which was originally designed to collect asteroid light curves for
rotation period measurements (Chang et al., 2019). The algorithm recovered most
of the known asteroids in the observing fields and, moreover, discovered 3574
new asteroids with magnitude mainly of 21.5 < w_p1 < 22.5 mag. This magnitude
range is equivalent to sub-kilometer main-belt asteroids (MBAs), which usually
lack of rotation period measurements due to their faintness. Using the light
curves of the 3574 new asteroids, we obtained 122 reliable rotation periods, of
which 13 are super-fast rotators (SRFs; i.e., rotation period of < 2 hr). The
required cohesion to survive these SFRs range from tens to thousands of Pa, a
value consistent with the known SFRs and the regolith on the Moon and Mars. The
higher chance of discovering SFRs here suggests that sub-kilometer MBAs
probably harbor more SFRs.

acoustic strain waves, we observe an ultra-high frequency magnetic resonance up

strain-spin interaction. Our model reveals that the energy could be transferred
efficiently from the strain to the spins and well explains the existence of a
steady resonance state through exciting the spin system. The physical origins
of the resonance between strain waves and magnetic precession and the requested
conditions for obtaining magnetic resonance within thin magnetic films have
also been discussed after thorough analysis. These combined results point out a
potential pathway to enable an extremely high frequency (EHF) magnetic

method to probe its crystal quality is missing. Furthermore, traditional
\k{appa} measurement methods are destructive and time consuming, thus they
cannot meet the urgent demand for fast screening of high \k{appa} materials.
After we experimentally established 1.82 eV as the indirect bandgap of BAs and
observed room-temperature band-edge photoluminescence, we developed two new
optical techniques that can provide rapid and non-destructive characterization
of \k{appa} with little sample preparation: photoluminescence mapping
(PL-mapping) and time-domain thermo-photoluminescence (TDTP). PL-mapping
provides nearly real-time image of crystal quality and \k{appa} over mm-sized
crystal surfaces; while TDTP allows us to pick up any spot on the sample
surface and measure its \k{appa} using nanosecond laser pulses. These new
techniques reveal that the apparent single crystals are not only non-uniform in
\k{appa}, but also are made of domains of very distinct \k{appa}. Because
PL-mapping and TDTP are based on the band-edge PL and its dependence on
temperature, they can be applied to other semiconductors, thus paving the way
for rapid identification and development of high-\k{appa} semiconducting

more principled NCS is presented, explaining that the parallel exploration is
equivalent to the explicit maximization of both the population diversity and
the population solution qualities, and can be optimally obtained by partially
gradient descending both models with respect to each search process. For
empirical assessments, the reinforcement learning tasks that largely demand

the significant advantages of NCS over the compared state-of-the-art methods

coupled with nonparametric smoothing. The method begins with quantile
periodograms which are constructed by trigonometric quantile regression at
different quantile levels, to represent the serial dependence of time series at
various quantiles. At each quantile level, we approximate the quantile spectrum
by a function in the form of an ordinary AR spectrum. In this model, we first
compute what we call the quantile autocovariance function (QACF) by the inverse
Fourier transformation of the quantile periodogram at each quantile level.
Then, we solve the Yule-Walker equations formed by the QACF to obtain the
quantile partial autocorrelation function (QPACF) and the scale parameter.
Finally, we smooth QPACF and the scale parameter across the quantile levels
using a nonparametric smoother, convert the smoothed QPACF to AR coefficients,
and obtain the AR spectral density function. Numerical results show that the
proposed method outperforms other conventional smoothing techniques. We take
advantage of the two-dimensional property of the estimators and train a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify smoothed quantile periodogram of
earthquake data and achieve a higher accuracy than a similar classifier using
ordinary periodograms.

spectrum alone and in addition with other data sets: baryon acoustic
oscillations (BAO) as well as primary CMB spectra from Planck and SPTpol. The
cosmological constraints based on SPTpol and Planck lensing band powers are in
good agreement when analysed alone and in combination with Planck full-sky
primary CMB data. With weak priors on the baryon density and other parameters,
the CMB lensing data alone provide a 4\% constraint on $\sigma_8\Omega_m^{0.25}

72.0^{+2.1}_{-2.5}\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}\,\text{Mpc}^{-1} $, up to
$2\,\sigma$ away from the central values preferred by Planck lensing + BAO.
However, we recover good agreement between SPTpol and Planck when restricting
the analysis to similar scales. We also consider single-parameter extensions to
the flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The SPTpol lensing spectrum constrains the spatial
curvature to be $\Omega_K = -0.0007 \pm 0.0025$ and the sum of the neutrino

electroweak theory. The smallness of neutrino masses can be guaranteed by a
seesaw mechanism realized through Yukawa couplings to a scalar
$SU(4)$-decuplet. In this scheme the light active neutrinos are accompanied by
heavy neutrinos, which may have masses at different scales, including those
within eV-MeV scales investigated quite intensively in both particle physics
and astrophysics/cosmology. The flavour neutrinos are superpositions of light
neutrinos and a small fraction of heavy neutrinos with the mixing to be
determined by the model's parameters (Yukawa coupling coefficients or symmetry
breaking scales). The distribution shape of the Yukawa couplings can be
visualized via a model-independent distribution of the neutrino mass matrix
elements derived by using the current experimental data. With reference to
several current and near future experiments, detectable bounds of these heavy
neutrinos at different mass scales are discussed and estimated.

areas of Australia and the US. The number of workers and aggregate incomes in
specific high income knowledge economy related occupations and industries show
increasing returns to scale by city size, showing that localization economies
within particular industries account for superlinear effects. However, when
total urban area incomes and/or Gross Domestic Products are regressed using a
generalised Cobb-Douglas function against the number of workers in different
occupations as labour inputs, constant returns to scale in productivity against
city size are observed. This implies that the urbanization economies at the
whole city level show linear scaling or constant returns to scale. Furthermore,
industrial and occupational organisations, not population size, largely explain
the observed productivity variable. The results show that some very specific
industries and occupations contribute to the observed overall superlinearity.
The findings suggest that it is not just size but also that it is the diversity
of specific intra-city organization of economic and social activity and
physical infrastructure that should be used to understand urban scaling
behaviors.

standard approaches. Spintronics offers a promising basis for the development
of efficient devices and unconventional operations for at least three main
reasons: (i) the low-power requirements of spin-based devices, i.e., requiring
no standby power for operation and the possibility to write information with
small dynamic energy dissipation, (ii) the strong nonlinearity, time
nonlocality, and/or stochasticity that spintronic devices can exhibit, and

treatment on a treated unit given a control sample with untreated outcomes.
Here we develop a generative learning approach to this problem, learning the
probability distribution of the data, which can be used for downstream tasks
such as post-treatment counterfactual prediction and hypothesis testing. We use
control samples to transform the data to a Gaussian and homoschedastic form and
then perform Gaussian process analysis in Fourier space, evaluating the optimal
Gaussian kernel via non-parametric power spectrum estimation. We combine this
Gaussian prior with the data likelihood given by the pre-treatment data of the
single unit, to obtain the synthetic prediction of the unit post-treatment,
which minimizes the error variance of synthetic prediction. Given the
generative model the minimum variance counterfactual is unique, and comes with
an associated error covariance matrix. We extend this basic formalism to
include correlations of primary variable with other covariates of interest.
Given the probabilistic description of generative model we can compare
synthetic data prediction with real data to address the question of whether the
treatment had a statistically significant impact. For this purpose we develop a
hypothesis testing approach and evaluate the Bayes factor. We apply the method
to the well studied example of California (CA) tobacco sales tax of 1988. We
also perform a placebo analysis using control states to validate our
methodology. Our hypothesis testing method suggests 5.8:1 odds in favor of CA
tobacco sales tax having an impact on the tobacco sales, a value that is at
least three times higher than any of the 38 control states.

assumption is infrequently carefully tested in data. We develop a statistically
principled method to directly estimate the correlation between latent
components of cognitive processing across tasks, contexts, and time. This
method simultaneously estimates individual-participant parameters of a
cognitive model at each testing occasion, group-level parameters representing
across-participant parameter averages and variances, and across-task
correlations. The approach provides a natural way to ""borrow"" strength across
testing occasions, which can increase the precision of parameter estimates
across all testing occasions. Two example applications demonstrate that the
method is practical in standard designs. The examples, and a simulation study,
also provide evidence about the reliability and validity of parameter estimates
from the linear ballistic accumulator model. We conclude by highlighting the
potential of the parameter-correlation method to provide an ""assumption-light""
tool for estimating the relatedness of cognitive processes across tasks,

due to the excessively large variance of typical importance sampling (IS)
estimators. Recently, Liu et al. (2018a) proposed an approach that
significantly reduces the variance of infinite-horizon off-policy evaluation by
estimating the stationary density ratio, but at the cost of introducing
potentially high biases due to the error in density ratio estimation. In this
paper, we develop a bias-reduced augmentation of their method, which can take
advantage of a learned value function to obtain higher accuracy. Our method is
doubly robust in that the bias vanishes when either the density ratio or the
value function estimation is perfect. In general, when either of them is
accurate, the bias can also be reduced. Both theoretical and empirical results
show that our method yields significant advantages over previous methods.

removing the first order radial gradients present in each galaxy, we look at
the statistics of the metallicity offset (Delta O/H) and explore azimuthal
variations. Across each galaxy, we find low (sigma=0.03-0.05 dex) scatter at
any given radius, indicative of efficient mixing. We compare physical
parameters for those HII regions that are 1 sigma outliers towards both
enhanced and reduced abundances. Regions with enhanced abundances have high
ionization parameter, higher Halpha luminosity, lower Halpha velocity
dispersion, younger star clusters and associated molecular gas clouds show
higher molecular gas densities. This indicates recent star formation has
locally enriched the material. Regions with reduced abundances show increased
Halpha velocity dispersions, suggestive of mixing introducing more pristine
material. We observe subtle azimuthal variations in half of the sample, but can
not always cleanly associate this with the spiral pattern. Regions with
enhanced and reduced abundances are found distributed throughout the disk, and
in half of our galaxies we can identify subsections of spiral arms with clearly

challenging task despite the recent advances in deep generative models. This
paper proposes a method that can create a high-resolution, long-term animation
using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from a single landscape image where
we mainly focus on skies and waters. Our key observation is that the motion
(e.g., moving clouds) and appearance (e.g., time-varying colors in the sky) in
natural scenes have different time scales. We thus learn them separately and
predict them with decoupled control while handling future uncertainty in both
predictions by introducing latent codes. Unlike previous methods that infer
output frames directly, our CNNs predict spatially-smooth intermediate data,
i.e., for motion, flow fields for warping, and for appearance, color transfer
maps, via self-supervised learning, i.e., without explicitly-provided ground
truth. These intermediate data are applied not to each previous output frame,
but to the input image only once for each output frame. This design is crucial
to alleviate error accumulation in long-term predictions, which is the
essential problem in previous recurrent approaches. The output frames can be
looped like cinemagraph, and also be controlled directly by specifying latent
codes or indirectly via visual annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method through comparisons with the state-of-the-arts on video prediction
as well as appearance manipulation.

novel graph algorithm to organize objects such as network elements and resource

scheme of identifier-locator mapping is designed by referring to
information-centric networking and software-defined networking. For the user

Using a quantum van der Pol oscillator with squeezing and Kerr effects as an

that the optimized waveform for the entrainment stability yields faster
entrainment to the driving signal than the case with a simple sinusoidal
waveform, while that for the phase coherence yields little improvement from the
sinusoidal case. These results are explained from the properties of the phase

are meaningfully larger than what would result from the area-weighted average
of those of homogeneous smooth and rough surfaces. This drag increase appears
to be linked to the strength of the secondary flow. The rotational direction of
the secondary motion is shown to depend on the relative surface elevation. The
present results suggest that this rearrangement of the secondary flow is linked
to the spatial distribution of the spanwise-wall-normal Reynolds stress
component which carries opposing signs for protruding and recessed roughness.

The broken inversion symmetry allows in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
between the nearest neighbors, which does not affect the magnon spectrum in the
linear spin wave theory. However, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can
induce large Berry curvature in the magnetoelastic excitation spectrum through
the magnon-phonon interaction to produce thermal Hall current. Furthermore, we
find that the magnetoelastic excitations transport spin, which is inherited
from the magnon bands. Therefore, the thermal Hall current is accompanied by
spin Nernst current. Because the magnon-phonon interaction does not conserve
the spin, we also study the spin density induced by thermal gradient in the
presence of magnon-phonon interaction. We find that the intrinsic part of the
spin density shows no asymmetric spin accumulation near the boundary of the
system having a stripe geometry. However, because of the magnon-phonon
interaction, we find nonzero total spin density in the system having armchair
edges. The extrinsic part of the spin density, on the other hand, shows
asymmetric spin accumulation near the boundary for both armchair and zigzag
edges because of the magnon-phonon interaction. In addition, we find nonzero
total spin density in the system having zigzag edge.

semiconducting behavior with a direct bandgap of 1.67 eV on the {\Gamma} point.
However, when impurities such as F, Cl, or Br atoms are introduced, the 2D ZnO
shows semi-metallic behavior with almost zero bandgap. It is perceived that,
owing to the introduction of F impurity, the zero bandgap is exhibited at the K
point of the electronic band structure. However, in the case of Cl and Br
impurities, the nearly zero bandgap is observed elsewhere rather than on the K
point. Moreover, due to the introduction of impurity atoms, the Fermi level
also shifted towards the conduction band (CB) suggesting an increase of the
carrier concentration in the density of states (DOS) results. These findings
might be very much beneficial when doping effect, especially halogen impurity
doping is considered to modulate the electronic properties of 2D ZnO in the

achieve an unprecedented convergence range in which images can be aligned given

observational constraints exist, such simplified models are unable to predict
salient features of their multi-wavelength emission. This paper aims to
carefully model the radio and X-ray emission of PSR~J1136+1551 with an
off-centred magnetic dipole to reconcile both wavelength measurements. We
simultaneously fit the radio pulse profile with its polarization and the
thermal X-ray emission from the polar cap hot spots of PSR~J1136+1551. We are
able to pin down the parameters of the non-dipolar geometry (which we have
assumed to be an offset dipole) and the viewing angle, meanwhile accounting for
the time lag between X-rays and radio emission. Our model fits the data if the
off-centred magnetic dipole lies about 20\% below the neutron star surface. We
also expect very asymmetric polar cap shapes and sizes, implying non antipodal
and non identical thermal emission from the hot spots. We conclude that a
non-dipolar surface magnetic field is an essential feature to explain the

embeddings define a multilingual space where word embeddings from two or more
languages are integrated together. Current state-of-the-art approaches learn
these embeddings by aligning two disjoint monolingual vector spaces through an
orthogonal transformation which preserves the structure of the monolingual

after this initial alignment step, which aims to bring the vector
representations of a given word and its translations closer to their average.
Since this additional transformation is non-orthogonal, it also affects the
structure of the monolingual spaces. We show that our approach both improves
the integration of the monolingual spaces as well as the quality of the
monolingual spaces themselves. Furthermore, because our transformation can be
applied to an arbitrary number of languages, we are able to effectively obtain
a truly multilingual space. The resulting (monolingual and multilingual) spaces
show consistent gains over the current state-of-the-art in standard intrinsic

  optimization","25 pages,13 figures,8 tables",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Moving Morphable Component (MMC) based topology optimization approach is an
explicit algorithm since the boundary of the entity explicitly described by its
functions. Compared with other pixel or node point-based algorithms, it is
optimized through the parameter optimization of a Topological Description
Function (TDF). However, the optimized results partly depend on the selection
of related parameters of Method of Moving Asymptote (MMA), which is the
optimizer of MMC based topology optimization. Practically, these parameters are
tuned according to the experience and the feasible solution might not be easily
obtained, even the solution might be infeasible due to improper parameter
setting. In order to address these issues, a Machine Learning (ML) based
parameter tuning strategy is proposed in this study. An Extra-Trees (ET) based
image classifier is integrated to the optimization framework, and combined with
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to form a closed loop. It makes the
optimization process be free from the manual parameter adjustment and the
reasonable solution in the design domain is obtained. In this study, two
classical cases are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
approach.

the chain Hamiltonian is very similar to that for the classic inorganic magnet
CsNiF3, but with ferromagnetic rather than antiferromagnetic interchain
interactions. The data at large magnetic fields are well-described by the
soliton picture, where the dominant (and topologically non-trivial) degrees of

for CsNiF3, and at low temperatures and fields by the super-Curie-Weiss law of
1/(T^2+theta^2) characteristic of nearly one-dimensional xy and Heisenberg

ferromagnetism of FePc systems, and produce them on flexible substrates as thin

reported previously for nanowires of copper and cobalt analogues, makes them
potentially useful for magneto-optical and spintronic devices.

that this scaling breaks down at low frequencies, due to finite dimensional

  Without Calibration","12 pages",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based 3-DoF angle estimation methods for
lower limb joints have been studied for decades, however the calibration
motions and/or careful sensor placement are still necessary due to challenges
of real-time application. This study proposes a novel sensormovement-robust
3-DoF method for lower-limb joint angle estimation without calibration. A
realtime optimization process, which is based on a feedback iteration progress
to identify three joint axes of a 3-DoF joint, has been presented with a
reference frame calibration algorithm, and a safe-guarded strategy is proposed
to detect and compensate for the errors caused by sensor movements. The
experimental results obtained from a 3-DoF gimbal and ten healthy subjects
demonstrate a promising performance on 3-DoF angle estimation. Specially, the
experiments on ten subjects are performed with three gait modes and a 2-min
level walking. The root mean square error is below 2 deg for level walking and
5 deg for other two gait modes. The result of 2-min level walking shows our
algorithms stability under long run. The robustness against sensor movement are
demonstrated through data from multiple sets of IMUs. In addition, results from
the 3-DoF gimbal indicate that the accuracy of 3-DoF angle estimation could be
improved by 84.9% with our reference frame calibration algorithm. In
conclusion, our study proposes and validates a sensor-movement-robust 3-DoF
angle estimation for lowerlimb joints based on IMU. To the best of our
knowledge, our approach is the first experimental implementation of IMUbased
3-DoF angle estimation for lower-limb joints without calibration.

resolve small structures in $\gamma$-ray spectra with high-energies. Three
methods have been compared using $\gamma$-ray spectra with energies up to 12
MeV obtained in an experiment at the 3 MV Tandetron\texttrademark\ facility at
IFIN-HH. The results show that the iterative unfolding approach gives the best
qualitative reproduction of the emitted $\gamma$-ray spectrum. Furthermore, the
correlation fluctuations in high-energy regime from the iterative method are
two orders of magnitude smaller than when using the matrix inversion approach
with second derivative regularization. In addition, the iterative method is
computationally faster as it does not contain large matrix inversions. The
matrix inversion method does, however, give more consistent results over the
full energy range and in the low-statistics limit. Our conclusion is that the
performance of the iterative approach makes it well suitable for semi-online
analysis of experimental data. These results will be important, both for
experiments with the ELIGANT setup, and for on-line diagnostics of the energy
spread of the $\gamma$-ray beam which is under implementation at ELI-NP.

aspect is that we define and study moduli spaces of deformations of algebraic
structures up to quasi-isomorphisms (and not just isotopies or isomorphisms).
To do so, we implement methods coming from derived algebraic geometry, by
encapsulating these deformation theories as classifying (pre)stacks with good
infinitesimal properties and %derived formal geometry, by means of derived
formal moduli problems and derived formal groups. In particular, we prove that
the Lie algebra describing the deformation theory of an object in a given

complex of loops on a derived quotient of this moduli space by the homotopy
automorphims of this object. Moreover, we provide explicit formulae for such

algebraic structures. This relation is given by a fiber sequence of the
associated dg-Lie algebras of their deformation complexes. Our results provide
simultaneously a vast generalization of standard deformation theory of
algebraic structures which is suitable (and needed) to set up algebraic
deformation theory both at the $\infty$-categorical level and at a higher level

Coulomb) interactions are systematically evaluated and analyzed in one-, two-,
and three spatial dimensions (${\mathcal D}=1,2,3$). In the strongly coupled
regime the convenient sound velocity scale is given by $\sqrt{Q^2/\Delta m}$,
where $Q$ is the particle charge, $m$ is the particle mass, $n$ is the particle
density, and $\Delta=n^{-1/{\mathcal D}}$ is the unified interparticle
distance. The sound velocity can be expressed as a product of this scaling
factor and a dimension-dependent function of the screening parameter,
$\kappa=\Delta/\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the screening length. A unified
approach is used to derive explicit expressions for these dimension-dependent
functions in the weakly screened regime ($\kappa\lesssim 3$). It is also
demonstrated that for stronger screening ($\kappa\gtrsim 3$), the effect of
spatial dimensionality virtually disappears, the longitudinal sound velocities
approach a common asymptote, and a one-dimensional nearest-neighbor
approximation provides a relatively good estimate for this asymptote. This
result is not specific to the Yukawa potential, but equally applies to other
classical systems with steep repulsive interactions. An emerging relation to a
popular simple freezing indicator is briefly discussed. Overall, the results
can be useful when Yukawa interactions are relevant, in particular, in the
context of complex (dusty) plasmas and colloidal suspensions.

considerations before targeting the numerical calculation of electron and hole

is comparable to the effective potential obtained from $\hat{H}u=1$, ensuring
that it can for instance be used to introduce quantum corrections to

convergence of the calculated energies and the robustness of the method against
the chosen integration region for $u$ to obtain the corresponding energies. We

Nevertheless, classical ML-based classifiers have some limitations. For
instance, they require large amounts of labeled data for training, which might
be difficult to obtain. Additionally, most ML-based classifiers are not capable
of domain adaptation, i.e. after being trained on an specific data

the engineering design process to achieve highly efficient results. A central
aspect for such approaches is the mapping from the design parameters which
encode the geometry of the shape to be improved to the quality criteria which
describe its performance. The choices to be made in the setup of the
optimization process strongly influence this mapping and thus are expected to
have a profound influence on the achievable result. In this work we explore the
influence of such choices on the effects on the shape optimization of a
turbofan rotor blade as it can be realized within an aircraft engine design
process. The blade quality is assessed by realistic three dimensional
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.
  We investigate the outcomes of several optimization runs which differ in
various configuration options, such as optimization algorithm, initialization,
number of degrees of freedom for the parametrization. For all such variations,
we generally find that the achievable improvement of the blade quality is
comparable for most settings and thus rather insensitive to the details of the
setup.
  On the other hand, even supposedly minor changes in the settings, such as
using a different random seed for the initialization of the optimizer
algorithm, lead to very different shapes. Optimized shapes which show
comparable performance usually differ quite strongly in their geometries over
the complete blade.
  Our analyses indicate that the fitness landscape for such a realistic

approach to drive adoption: Games offer small rewards such as visual

this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of these incentives and investigate
how they can be applied to non-gaming contexts. We conducted two surveys, one
recruiting gamers and one recruiting from a general population. In addition, we
conducted three focus group interviews to evaluate various incentive designs
for both, the gaming context and the non-gaming context. We found that visual
modifications, which are the most popular type of gaming-related incentives,
are not as popular in non-gaming contexts. However, our design explorations
indicate that well-chosen incentives have the potential to lead to more users
adopting 2FA, even outside of the gaming context.

amorphous dust from microwave through far infrared wavebands are presented by
taking into account, self-consistently for the first time, the standard
two-level systems (TLS) model of amorphous materials. The observed spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) for the Perseus molecular cloud (MC) and W43 from
microwave through far infrared are fitted with the SEDs calculated with the TLS
model of amorphous silicate. We have found that the model SEDs well reproduce
the observed properties of the anomalous microwave emission (AME). The present
result suggests an alternative interpretation for the AME being carried by the
resonance emission of the TLS of amorphous materials without introducing new
species. Simultaneous fitting of the intensity and polarization SEDs for the
Perseus MC and W43 are also performed. The amorphous model reproduces the
overall observed feature of the intensity and polarization SEDs of the Perseus
MC and W43. However, the model's predicted polarization fraction of the AME is
slightly higher than the QUIJOTE upper limits in several frequency bands. A
possible improvement of our model to resolve this problem is proposed. Our
model predicts that interstellar dust is amorphous materials having very
different physical characteristics compared with terrestrial amorphous
materials.

scanning low-intensity femtosecond laser pulses with energy well below

structures (LIPSS) were produced, depending on the scanning velocity, (1)
parallel to laser light polarization with periodicity somewhat smaller than
laser wavelength and (2) perpendicular to polarization with spatial period much
smaller than wavelength. All structures are formed as protrusions above the
initial film surface and exhibit a high degree of oxidation. To explain
formation of the LIPSS and their conversion from one to another type, a
rigorous numerical approach for modeling surface electromagnetic waves in
thin-film geometry has been developed, which takes into account the change of
optical properties of material due to laser-induced oxidation and porosity. The
approach addresses the multiplicity of electromagnetic modes allowed for thin
films. It has been found that the low spatial frequency LIPSS parallel to laser
polarization, which are formed at low scanning velocities, are well described
by the Sipe theory for surfaces of low roughness. The SEW mode responsible for
high spatial frequency LIPSS formation at high scanning velocities has been
identified. The mechanisms of optical feedback and transformation between types

sense, this article is devoted to the renormalization group analysis of

group methodology is applied to the investigation of how rate-laws describing
such reactions are transformed when the geometric scale is changed. The precise
purpose of such analysis is to investigate whether or not power-law rate-laws
present some remarkable features accounting for the successes of power-law
modeling. As we shall see, according to the renormalization group point of view
the answer is positive, as far as power-laws are the critical solutions of the
renormalization group transformation, namely power-law rate-laws are the
renormalization group invariant solutions. Moreover, it is shown that these
results also imply invariance under the group of concentration scalings, thus
accounting for the reported power-law model accuracy over several orders of

fast Alfvenic solar wind streams, focussing on the statistics of the rotation
angle between consecutive magnetic field vector measurements for different
scales in the plasma. Since in the fast solar wind fluctuations preserve the
modulus of the magnetic field to a good approximation, the tip of the magnetic
field vector is observed to move on a sphere of approximately constant radius
|B|. We then compare statistics of solar wind measurements with that of a
simple model of a random walk bounded on a spherical surface. The analogy
consists in the fact that in both systems the geometrical constraint imposes a
limiting amplitude at large separations and thus introduces a break scale in
the power spectrum of the fluctuations, leading to a shallower slope for scales
where the fluctuations amplitude becomes scale-independent. However, while in
the case of the random walk the saturation of the fluctuations occurs when the
pattern becomes uniform on the sphere (flat distribution of the cosine of the
rotation angle), transitioning then to a white noise regime, in the solar wind
magnetic field fluctuations saturate in amplitude maintaining a preferential
direction. We suggest that this behaviour is due to the presence of the
background interplanetary magnetic field, which keeps some long-range memory in
the system also when the fluctuations becomes independent of the scale. This
long-range correlation is a necessary ingredient in order to produce the 1/f
spectrum observed at large scales in the solar wind.

proton spectra for GLE69 are softer than that for GLE59 after the flares,
suggesting that the shock driven by eastern flank of the CME associated with
GLE69 is weaker than the shock driven by the western flank of the CME

stronger potential in accelerating particles than the quasi-parallel shock. The

wide-binary protostellar system BHR 71 IRS1 and IRS2. IRS1 features what
appears to be a natal, hourglass-shaped magnetic field. In contrast, IRS2
exhibits a magnetic field that has been affected by its bipolar outflow. Toward
IRS2, the polarization is confined mainly to the outflow cavity walls. Along
the northern edge of the redshifted outflow cavity of IRS2, the polarized
emission is sandwiched between the outflow and a filament of cold, dense gas
traced by N$_2$D$^+$, toward which no dust polarization is detected. This
suggests that the origin of the enhanced polarization in IRS2 is the
irradiation of the outflow cavity walls, which enables the alignment of dust
grains with respect to the magnetic field -- but only to a depth of ~300 au,
beyond which the dust is cold and unpolarized. However, in order to align
grains deep enough in the cavity walls, and to produce the high polarization
fraction seen in IRS2, the aligning photons are likely to be in the mid- to
far-infrared range, which suggests a degree of grain growth beyond what is
typically expected in very young, Class 0 sources. Finally, toward IRS1 we see
a narrow, linear feature with a high (10-20%) polarization fraction and a well
ordered magnetic field that is not associated with the bipolar outflow cavity.
We speculate that this feature may be a magnetized accretion streamer; however,
this has yet to be confirmed by kinematic observations of dense-gas tracers.

typically requires the design of shaped reward functions. Recent developments
in this area have demonstrated that using sparse rewards, i.e. rewarding the
agent only when the task has been successfully completed, can lead to better
policies. However, state-action space exploration is more difficult in this
case. Recent RL approaches to learning with sparse rewards have leveraged
high-quality human demonstrations for the task, but these can be costly, time
consuming or even impossible to obtain. In this paper, we propose a novel and
effective approach that does not require human demonstrations. We observe that
every robotic manipulation task could be seen as involving a locomotion task
from the perspective of the object being manipulated, i.e. the object could
learn how to reach a target state on its own. In order to exploit this idea, we
introduce a framework whereby an object locomotion policy is initially obtained
using a realistic physics simulator. This policy is then used to generate
auxiliary rewards, called simulated locomotion demonstration rewards (SLDRs),
which enable us to learn the robot manipulation policy. The proposed approach
has been evaluated on 13 tasks of increasing complexity, and can achieve higher
success rate and faster learning rates compared to alternative algorithms.
SLDRs are especially beneficial for tasks like multi-object stacking and
non-rigid object manipulation.

presence of selection bias. A current promising solution for the bias is the
inverse propensity score (IPS) estimation. However, the performance of existing
propensity-based methods can suffer significantly from the propensity
estimation bias. In fact, most of the previous IPS-based methods require some
amount of missing-completely-at-random (MCAR) data to accurately estimate the
propensity. This leads to a critical self-contradiction; IPS is ineffective
without MCAR data, even though it originally aims to learn recommenders from
only missing-not-at-random feedback. To resolve this propensity contradiction,
we derive a propensity-independent generalization error bound and propose a
novel algorithm to minimize the theoretical bound via adversarial learning. Our
theory and algorithm do not require a propensity estimation procedure, thereby
leading to a well-performing rating predictor without the true propensity
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is
superior to a range of existing methods both in rating prediction and ranking
metrics in practical settings without MCAR data.

Fabry-P\'erot-based scheme to estimate the losses of a nonlinear (birefringent

method involves measuring the generated second harmonic power as the pump
wavelength is scanned over the phasematching region. Furthermore, it is shown
that this method allows one to infer the losses of different second harmonic
spatial modes by scanning the pump field over the separated phase matching
spectra. By fitting the measured phasematching spectra from a titanium
indiffused lithium niobate waveguide sample to the model presented in this
paper, it is shown that one can estimate the second harmonic losses of a single
spatial-mode, at wavelengths where the waveguides are spatially multi-mode.

combination of material properties: high electron mobility, strong spin-orbit
interaction, large Land\'{e} g-factor, and small effective mass. This makes
them an attractive platform to explore a variety of mesoscopic phenomena
ranging from spintronics to topological superconductivity. However, there exist
limited studies of quantum confined systems in these 2DEGs, often attributed to
charge instabilities and gate drifts. We overcome this by removing the
$\delta$-doping layer from the heterostructure, and induce carriers
electrostatically. This allows us to perform the first detailed study of stable
gate-defined quantum dots in InSb 2DEGs. We demonstrate two distinct strategies
for carrier confinement and study the charge stability of the dots. The small
effective mass results in a relatively large single particle spacing, allowing
for the observation of an even-odd variation in the addition energy. By
tracking the Coulomb oscillations in a parallel magnetic field we determine the
ground state spin configuration and show that the large g-factor ($\sim$30)
results in a singlet-triplet transition at magnetic fields as low as 0.3 T.

misinterpretation in ultrafast pulse characterization measurements. Most
prominently known as the coherent artifact, a partially mode-locked laser with

misinterpreted as indication for a coherent pulse train. Some modern pulse
characterization methods easily miss the presence of a coherent artifact, too.
Here we address the particularly difficult situation of a pulse train with
chirp-only instability. This instability is shown to be virtually invisible to
autocorrelation measurements, but can be detected with FROG, SPIDER, and
dispersion scan. Our findings clearly show that great care is necessary to rule
out a chirp instability in lasers with unclear mode-locking mechanism and in
compression experiments in the single-cycle regime. Among all dynamical pulse
train instabilities analyzed so far, this instability appears to be the best
hidden incoherence and is most difficult to detect.

Aloha with batch service, which has wide applications in random access
networks. Different from the classical slotted Aloha, each node in the slotted
Aloha with batch service can transmit up to M packets once it succeeds in
channel competition. The throughput is substantially improved because up to M
packets jointly undertake the overhead due to contention. In an innovative
vacation model developed in this paper, we consider each batch of data
transmission as a busy period of each node, and the process between two
successive busy periods as a vacation period. We then formulate the number of
arrivals during a vacation period in a renewal-type equation, which
characterizes the dependency between busy periods and vacation periods. Based
on this formulation, we derive the mean waiting time of a packet and the
bounded delay region for the slotted Aloha with batch service. Our results
indicate the throughput and delay performances are substantially improved with
the increase of batch sizeM, and the bounded delay region is enlarged
accordingly. As M goes to infinity, we find the saturated throughput can
approach 100% of channel capacity, and the system remains stable irrespective
of the population size and transmission probability.

observable parameters for a large number of galaxies as input explanatory
variables for training: magnitudes in U, B, I, and K bands, corresponding
colour indices, surface brightness, angular size, radial velocity, and
coordinates. We performed detailed tests of the five machine-learning
regression techniques for inference of $m-M$: linear, polynomial, k-nearest
neighbours, gradient boosting, and artificial neural network regression. As a
test set we selected 91 760 galaxies at $z<0.2$ from the NASA/IPAC
extragalactic database with distance moduli measured by different independent
redshift methods. We find that the most effective and precise is the neural
network regression model with two hidden layers. The obtained root-mean-square
error of 0.35 mag, which corresponds to a relative error of 16\%, does not
depend on the distance to galaxy and is comparable with methods based on the
Tully-Fisher and Fundamental Plane relations. The proposed model shows a 0.44
mag (20\%) error in the case of spectroscopic redshift absence and is
complementary to existing photometric redshift methodologies. Our approach has
great potential for obtaining distance moduli for around 250 000 galaxies at

the art solutions are based on the periodic broadcasting of the position

often be erratic, making transmitted data inaccurate or downright misleading.
To address this problem, we propose to adopt a dynamic transmission scheme
based on the actual positioning error, sending new data when the estimate
passes a preset error threshold. Furthermore, the proposed method adapts the
error threshold to the operational context according to a congestion control
algorithm that limits the collision probability among broadcast packet
transmissions. This threshold-based strategy can reduce the network load by
avoiding the transmission of redundant messages, and is shown to improve the
overall positioning accuracy by more than 20% in realistic urban scenarios.

errors, also regarding dependencies. This contradicts other studies. The
results also show that a proposed copula score provides very strong distinction
between models with correct and incorrect dependency structure. We close with a
comprehensive discussion on the proposed methodology.

To evaluate the desired parameters, the image should be segmented. Traditional

limitations with CT images quality. Errors in the evaluation of characteristics

predictions from those theories. In this paper, I consider the effect of
quenched orientational disorder on the phase behaviour of both polar and apolar
suspensions on substrates. I show that polar suspensions have long-range order
in two dimensions with anomalous number fluctuations, while their apolar
counterparts have only short-range order, albeit with a correlation length that
can increase with activity, and even more violent number fluctuations than
active nematics without quenched disorder. These results should be of value in
interpreting experiments on active suspensions on substrates with random
disorder.

off the inner disk from such volatile reservoirs. However, the trap retention

  We present a new technique to measure the absolute atomic abundances in gas
accreting onto T Tauri stars and infer the bulk atomic composition and
distribution of midplane solids retained in the disk around the young star TW
Hya. We identify line emission from gas-phase material inside the dust
sublimation rim of TW Hya. Gaussian decomposition of the strongest H Paschen
lines isolates the inner disk hydrogen emission. We measure several key
elemental abundances, relative to hydrogen, using a chemical photoionization
model and infer dust retention in the disk. With a 1D transport model, we
determine approximate radial locations and retention efficiencies of dust traps
for different elements. Volatile and refractory elements are depleted from TW
Hya's hot gas by factors of ~10^2 and up to 10^5, respectively. Dust traps
beyond the CO and N2 snowline cumulatively sequester 96% of the total dust,
while the trap at 2 AU retains 3% of the initial dust mass. The high depletions
of Si, Mg, and Ca are explained by a third trap at 0.3 AU. TW Hya has a
significant volatile reservoir rich in C- and N-ices in its outer ring

display various buckling patterns. These compressive stresses can have
different origins, like mechanical forces, temperature changes, or, for
hydrogel materials, osmotic swelling. Here, we focus on the influence of the
transient nature of osmotic swelling on the initiation of buckling in confined
layered hydrogel structures. A constitutive model for transient hydrogel
swelling is outlined and implemented as a user-subroutine for the commercial
finite element software Abaqus. The finite element procedure is benchmarked
against linear perturbation analysis results for equilibrium swelling showing
excellent correspondence. Based on the finite element results we conclude that
the initiation of buckling in a two-layered hydrogel structure is highly
affected by transient swelling effects, with instability emerging at lower
swelling ratios and later in time with a lower diffusion coefficient. In
addition, for hard-on-soft systems the wavelength of the buckling pattern is
found to decrease as the diffusivity of the material is reduced for gels with a
relatively low stiffness gradient between the substrate and the upper film.
This study highlights the difference between equilibrium and transient swelling
when it comes to the onset of instability in hydrogels, which is believed to be
of importance as a fundamental aspect of swelling as well as providing input to
guiding principles in the design of specific hydrogel systems.

Such a hierarchical prior has the potential to encourage clustered patterns and
suppress isolated coefficients whose patterns are different from their

non-convex bi-quadratically constrained quadratic problem into two rank-one
constrained matrices optimization problems via matrix lifting. At the same
time, to accurately detect the feasibility of the non-convex rank-one
constraints and improve performance by avoiding early stopping in the

difference-of-convex (DC) algorithm is further developed to solve the resulting
DC programs via successive convex relaxation, followed by establishing the

the independent stationary increments---the ""jump lengths""---are drawn from an

As a result, the variance of L\'evy Flights diverges and the trajectory is
characterised by occasional extremely long jumps. Such long jumps significantly
decrease the probability to revisit previous points of visitation, rendering
L\'evy Flights efficient search processes in one and two dimensions. To further
quantify their precise property as random search strategies we here study the
first-passage time properties of L\'evy Flights in one-dimensional
semi-infinite and bounded domains for symmetric and asymmetric jump length
distributions. To obtain the full probability density function of first-passage
times for these cases we employ two complementary methods. One approach is
based on the space-fractional diffusion equation for the probability density
function, from which the survival probability is obtained for different values
of the stable index $\alpha$ and the skewness (asymmetry) parameter $\beta$.
The other approach is based on the stochastic Langevin equation with
$\alpha$-stable driving noise. Both methods have their advantages and
disadvantages for explicit calculations and numerical evaluation, and the
complementary approach involving both methods will be profitable for concrete
applications. We also make use of the Skorokhod theorem for processes with

twelve Van Hove points for hole doping. We obtain pairing interactions for the

particular interest are the modifications of the mechanical properties of dsDNA
observed in experiments. The latter could affect many biological functions,

We find that, upon drug intercalation, stretch modulus of DNA increases
significantly, whereas its persistence length and bending modulus decrease.
Steered MD simulations reveal that it requires higher forces to stretch the
intercalated dsDNA complexes than the normal dsDNA. Adopting various pulling
protocols to study force-induced DNA melting, we find that the dissociation of
dsDNA becomes difficult in the presence of intercalators. The results obtained
here provide a plausible mechanism of function of the anticancer drugs, i.e.,
via altering the mechanical properties of DNA. We also discuss long-time

particular interest is the interpretation of how deep neural networks make
decisions, given the complexity and `black box' nature of such networks. Given
the infancy of the field, there has been very limited exploration into the
assessment of the performance of explainability methods, with most evaluations
centered around subjective visual interpretation of the produced
interpretations. In this study, we explore a more machine-centric strategy for
quantifying the performance of explainability methods on deep neural networks
via the notion of decision-making impact analysis. We introduce two
quantitative performance metrics: i) Impact Score, which assesses the
percentage of critical factors with either strong confidence reduction impact
or decision changing impact, and ii) Impact Coverage, which assesses the
percentage coverage of adversarially impacted factors in the input. A
comprehensive analysis using this approach was conducted on several
state-of-the-art explainability methods (LIME, SHAP, Expected Gradients,
GSInquire) on a ResNet-50 deep convolutional neural network using a subset of
ImageNet for the task of image classification. Experimental results show that
the critical regions identified by LIME within the tested images had the lowest
impact on the decision-making process of the network (~38%), with progressive
increase in decision-making impact for SHAP (~44%), Expected Gradients (~51%),
and GSInquire (~76%). While by no means perfect, the hope is that the proposed
machine-centric strategy helps push the conversation forward towards better
metrics for evaluating explainability methods and improve trust in deep neural

calculations based on Thiele equation, we demonstrate that an antidot array can
guide the skyrmions in different directions depending on the parameters of the
applied current pulse. Despite the fixed direction of the net driving current,
due to the non-trivial interplay between the repulsive potential introduced by
the antidots, the skyrmion Hall effect and the non-uniform current
distribution, full control of skyrmion motion in a 2D lattice can be achieved.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the direction of skyrmion motion can be
controlled by tuning only a single parameter of the current pulse, i.e. current
magnitude. For lower current magnitudes the skyrmion can be moved
perpendicularly to the current direction, and can overcome the skyrmion Hall
effect. For larger current magnitudes, the skyrmion Hall effect can be
effectively suppressed and skyrmions can move parallel to the applied current.

(Bollen \& Maydeu-Olivares, 2007), and the introduction of a Generalized Method
of Moments (GMM) estimator (Bollen, Kolenikov \& Bauldry, 2014). This paper
furthers these developments by making several unique contributions not present
in the prior literature: (1) we use matrix calculus to derive the analytic
derivatives of the PIV estimator, (2) we extend the PIV estimator to apply to
any mixture of binary, ordinal, and continuous variables, (3) we generalize the
PIV model to include intercepts and means, (4) we devise a method to input
known threshold values for ordinal observed variables, and (5) we enable a
general parameterization that permits the estimation of means, variances, and
covariances of the underlying variables to use as input into a SEM analysis
with PIV. An empirical example illustrates a mixture of continuous variables
and ordinal variables with fixed thresholds. We also include a simulation study
to compare the performance of this novel estimator to WLSMV.

tempo, or for mapping other performance-related information between

performance, and then automatically synchronizing other performances, using
audio-to-audio alignment algorithms. In this paper we address several questions
related to those tasks. First, we analyze different annotations of the same
musical piece, quantifying timing deviations between the respective human
annotators. A statistical evaluation of the marker time stamps will provide (a)
an estimate of the expected timing precision of human annotations and (b) a
ground truth for subsequent automatic alignment experiments. We then carry out
a systematic evaluation of different audio features for audio-to-audio

combinations of the transition form factors can be deduced from Dalitz decays
of the Sigma* hyperon to Lambda plus an electron-positron pair. It is pointed
out how more information can be obtained with the help of the self-analyzing
weak decay of the Lambda. In particular it is shown that these transition form
factors are complex quantities already in this kinematical region. Such
measurements are feasible at hyperon factories as for instance the Facility for
Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR). At higher energies, the transition form
factors can be measured in electron-positron collisions. The pertinent
relations between the transition form factors and the decay distributions and
differential cross sections are presented. Using dispersion theory, the
low-energy electromagnetic form factors for the Sigma*-to-Lambda transition are
related to the pion vector form factor. The additionally required input, i.e.
the two-pion - Sigma* - Lambda amplitudes are determined from relativistic
next-to-leading-order (NLO) baryon chiral perturbation theory including the
baryons from the octet and the decuplet. A poorly known NLO parameter is fixed
to the experimental value of the Sigma* to Lambda-gamma decay width. Pion
rescattering is taken into account by dispersion theory solving a
Muskhelishvili-Omnes equation. Subtracted and unsubtracted dispersion relations
are discussed. However, in view of the fact that the transition form factors
are complex quantities, the current data situation does not allow for a full
determination of the subtraction constants. To reduce the number of free
parameters, unsubtracted dispersion relations are used to make predictions for
the transition form factors in the low-energy space- and timelike regions.

prove that the conjecture specializes in the relevant case of analytic rank one

Under mild hypotheses we also prove that the `order of vanishing' part of the

of cortical space, and yet they are the major consumers of brain metabolic
energy. What fraction of this energy goes for synaptic plasticity, correlated
with learning and memory? It is estimated here based on neurophysiological and
proteomic data for rat brain that, depending on the level of protein
phosphorylation, the energy cost of synaptic plasticity constitutes a small
fraction of the energy used for fast excitatory synaptic transmission,
typically $4.0-11.2 \%$. Next, this study analyzes a metabolic cost of a new
learning and its memory trace in relation to the cost of prior memories, using
a class of cascade models of synaptic plasticity. It is argued that these
models must contain bidirectional cyclic motifs, related to protein
phosphorylation, to be compatible with basic thermodynamic principles. For most
investigated parameters longer memories generally require proportionally more
energy to store. The exception are the parameters controlling the speed of
molecular transitions (e.g. ATP driven phosphorylation rate), for which memory
lifetime per invested energy can increase progressively for longer memories.
Furthermore, in general, a memory trace decouples dynamically from a
corresponding synaptic metabolic rate such that the energy expended on a new
learning and its memory trace constitutes in most cases only a small fraction
of the baseline energy associated with prior memories. Taken together, these

work studies an alternative approach, which uses the redundancy inherent in

Redundancy (NR), is abundant in many types of uncompressed or even compressed
files. The complex structures of Natural Redundancy, however, require machine
learning techniques. In this paper, we study two fundamental approaches to use
Natural Redundancy for error correction. The first approach, called
Representation-Oblivious, requires no prior knowledge on how data are
represented or compressed in files. It uses deep learning to detect file types
accurately, and then mine Natural Redundancy for soft decoding. The second
approach, called Representation-Aware, assumes that such knowledge is known and
uses it for error correction. Furthermore, both approaches combine the decoding
based on NR and ECCs. Both experimental results and analysis show that such an
integrated scheme can substantially improve the error correction performance.

a method to recover an optical beam from perturbations. Here we demonstrate
full phase conjugation of vector vortex beams using three-wave mixing. Our
scheme exploits a fast non-linear process that can be conveniently controlled
via the pump beam. Our results pave the way for sophisticated, practical
applications of vector beams.

  Cluster Size",,,"10.1111/rssc.12430",,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we study the impact of exposure misclassification when cluster
size is potentially informative (i.e., related to outcomes) and when
misclassification is differential by cluster size. First, we show that
misclassification in an exposure related to cluster size can induce
informativeness when cluster size would otherwise be non-informative. Second,
we show that misclassification that is differential by informative cluster size
can not only attenuate estimates of exposure effects but even inflate or
reverse the sign of estimates. To correct for bias in estimating marginal
parameters, we propose two frameworks: (i) an observed likelihood approach for
joint marginalized models of cluster size and outcomes and (ii) an expected
estimating equations approach. Although we focus on estimating marginal
parameters, a corollary is that the observed likelihood approach permits valid
inference for conditional parameters as well. Using data from the Nurses Health
Study II, we compare the results of the proposed correction methods when
applied to motivating data on the multigenerational effect of in-utero
diethylstilbestrol exposure on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in

controllers suitable for multiple task environments. Efforts to combat
catastrophic forgetting reported in the literature to date have focused on how
control systems can be updated more rapidly, hastening their adjustment from
good initial settings to new environments, or more circumspectly, suppressing
their ability to overfit to any one environment. When using robots, the
environment includes the robot's own body, its shape and material properties,
and how its actuators and sensors are distributed along its mechanical
structure. Here we demonstrate for the first time how one such design decision
(sensor placement) can alter the landscape of the loss function itself, either
expanding or shrinking the weight manifolds containing suitable controllers for
each individual task, thus increasing or decreasing their probability of
overlap across tasks, and thus reducing or inducing the potential for
catastrophic forgetting.

pulse width modulation (PWM). PWM signals represent information with their duty
cycle values which may be made independent of the voltages and frequencies of

demonstrate the power elasticity, resilience and efficiency of the proposed NN

such as predicting method names and identifying certain kinds of bugs. We show
that these models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and introduce a novel
approach for attacking trained models of code using adversarial examples. The
main idea of our approach is to force a given trained model to make an
incorrect prediction, as specified by the adversary, by introducing small
perturbations that do not change the program's semantics, thereby creating an
adversarial example. To find such perturbations, we present a new technique for
Discrete Adversarial Manipulation of Programs (DAMP). DAMP works by deriving
the desired prediction with respect to the model's inputs, while holding the
model weights constant, and following the gradients to slightly modify the
input code. We show that our DAMP attack is effective across three neural
architectures: code2vec, GGNN, and GNN-FiLM, in both Java and C#. Our
evaluations demonstrate that DAMP has up to 89% success rate in changing a
prediction to the adversary's choice (a targeted attack) and a success rate of
up to 94% in changing a given prediction to any incorrect prediction (a
non-targeted attack). To defend a model against such attacks, we empirically
examine a variety of possible defenses and discuss their trade-offs. We show
that some of these defenses can dramatically drop the success rate of the
attacker, with a minor penalty of 2% relative degradation in accuracy when they
are not performing under attack. Our code, data, and trained models are
available at https://github.com/tech-srl/adversarial-examples .

distribution, is studied in dependence on pair transverse momentum, azimuthal

distribution of ellipsoidal shape is found in the plane perpendicular to the
beam direction with the larger extension perpendicular to the reaction plane.
For large transverse momenta, the corresponding eccentricity approaches the
initial eccentricity. The eccentricity is smallest for most central collisions,
where the shape is almost circular. The magnitude of the tilt angle of the
emission ellipsoid in the reaction plane decreases with increasing centrality
and increasing transverse momentum. All source radii increase with centrality,
largely exhibiting a linear rise with the number of participants, irrespective

core component and consideration in the implementation of any smart building
technology. Research has shown that the adoption of human-centric building
services and amenities leads to improvements in the operational efficiency of
these cyber-physical systems directed towards controlling building energy
usage. We introduce a strategy in form of a game-theoretic framework that
incorporates humans-in-the-loop modeling by creating an interface to allow
building managers to interact with occupants and potentially incentivize energy
efficient behavior. Prior works on game theoretic analysis typically rely on
the assumption that the utility function of each individual agent is known a
priori. Instead, we propose novel utility learning framework for benchmarking
that employs robust estimations of occupant actions towards energy efficiency.
To improve forecasting performance, we extend the utility learning scheme by
leveraging deep bi-directional recurrent neural networks. Using the proposed
methods on data gathered from occupant actions for resources such as room
lighting, we forecast patterns of energy resource usage to demonstrate the
prediction performance of the methods. The results of our study show that we
can achieve a highly accurate representation of the ground truth for occupant
energy resource usage. We also demonstrate the explainable nature on human
decision making towards energy usage inherent in the dataset using graphical

quantiles are well known to be selectively elicitable, they fail to be
exhaustively elicitable. We further show that the class of prediction intervals

studied the regular dominating set problem using the cavity method and
developed two algorithms (belief propagation decimation and survey propagation
decimation) to estimate the solution of a given graph, resulting in very good
estimations of the minimal dominating size. This paper describes the
development of spin glass theory to study the 2-distance MDS problem. First, we
show that the belief propagation equation does not converge when the inverse
temperature $\beta$ is greater than a certain threshold value on both regular

equal to zero at finite inverse temperature on regular random graphs when the
node degree is from 3--9, and on Erdos--Renyi random networks when the node
degree is from 4.2--10.4; the entropy density is positive in all other cases.
This result is proved using a dynamical simulated annealing process. Third, the
results of replica symmetry theory are shown to be in agreement with those of
the belief propagation algorithm, and the results of the belief propagation
decimation algorithm are found to be better than those of the greedy heuristic
algorithm.

experiments look for this decay by identifying a summed double beta energy at
the Q value of the decay, but adding energy and angular measurements of the

nano-tracking detector based on a clever combination of thin film CdTe devices
will be presented here. This tracker will have order 100 nm spatial resolution

correlation analyses, and will simultaneously allow clear distinction between
double betas and single beta or gamma-induced electronic recoils. The detector
concept will be presented, along with preliminary studies, to demonstrate its

concludes that such models are not physically realizable. While
complex-parameter phenomenological models (including those with complex-order

frequency-dependent behavior of viscoelastic materials over a finite frequency
band, they do not possess physically acceptable time-response functions. The
paper first reviews the intimate relation between the causality of a physically
realizable constitutive model and the analyticity of its frequency-response
function and explains that in theory it is sufficient to conduct a nonlinear
regression analysis for estimating the model parameters either on only the real
part or on only the imaginary part of its frequency-response function, given
that they are related with the Hilbert transform. Consequently, the resulting
model-parameters are real-valued; therefore, there is no theoretical
justification to conduct the nonlinear regression analysis for estimating the
model parameters in the complex space. The paper concludes with an example by
showing that the relaxation modulus of the complex-coefficient Maxwell model is
a divergent function at all positive times; therefore it is not a physically

voltage stability index, power loss index, and loss sensitivity factors have
been implemented alongside the meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to reduce
the search space of solutions for objective functions. However, these
techniques can cause a loss of optimality. Another perceived problem is the
inappropriate handling of multiple objectives, which can also affect the
optimality of results. Hence, a recent method such as Pareto fronts generation
has been developed to produce non-dominating solutions. This review shows a
need for more research on (i) the effective handling of multiple objective
functions, (ii) more efficient meta-heuristic optimization algorithms and/or
(iii) better supporting techniques.

a large training and evaluation set comprised of 609,524 records, which is
published alongside this paper. These data allow to reproducibly assess
classification approaches, such as tree-based models and neural networks.
According to our experiments with 20 base classes (multi-label classification),
multi-layer perceptron models perform best with a f1-macro score of 0.760
closely followed by Long Short-Term Memory models (f1-macro score of 0.755). A
possible application of the trained classification models is the quantitative
analysis of trends towards interdisciplinarity of digital scholarly output or
the characterization of growth patterns of research data, stratified by
discipline of research. Both applications perform at scale with the proposed
models which are available for re-use.

history, and aggregating accrued dialogue information into a single state. This
fixed-size vector is not expandable and must maintain a consistent format over
time. Other recent approaches exploit an attention mechanism to extract useful
information from past conversational utterances, but this introduces an
increased computational complexity. In this work, we explore the use of the
Neural Turing Machine (NTM) to provide a more permanent and flexible storage
mechanism for maintaining dialogue coherence. Specifically, we introduce two
separate dialogue architectures based on this NTM design. The first design
features a sequence-to-sequence architecture with two separate NTM modules, one
for each participant in the conversation. The second memory architecture
incorporates a single NTM module, which stores parallel context information for
both speakers. This second design also replaces the sequence-to-sequence
architecture with a neural language model, to allow for longer context of the
NTM and greater understanding of the dialogue history. We report perplexity
performance for both models, and compare them to existing baselines.

two years, owing to its impressive performance on a number of natural language
processing (NLP) tasks. However, all Transformer computations occur at the
level of word representations and therefore, it may be argued that Transformer
models do not explicitly attempt to learn hierarchical structure which is
widely assumed to be integral to language. In the present work, we introduce
hierarchical processing into the Transformer model, taking inspiration from the
U-Net architecture, popular in computer vision for its hierarchical view of
natural images. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms both the vanilla Transformer and some strong baselines in the
domain of chit-chat dialogue.

to be effective in a variety of applications. In this work, we contribute to
the area of AI adoption in the public sector. We present an automated system
that was used to process textual information, generate important keywords, and
automatically summarize key elements of the Meadville community statements. We
also describe the process of collaboration with My Meadville administrators
during the development of our system. My Meadville, a community initiative,
supported by the city of Meadville conducted a large number of interviews with
the residents of Meadville during the community events and transcribed these
interviews into textual data files. Their goal was to uncover the issues of
importance to the Meadville residents in an attempt to enhance public services.
Our AI system cleans and pre-processes the interview data, then using machine
learning algorithms it finds important keywords and key excerpts from each
interview. It also provides searching functionality to find excerpts from
relevant interviews based on specific keywords. Our automated system allowed
the city to save over 300 hours of human labor that would have taken to read
all interviews and highlight important points. Our findings are being used by
My Meadville initiative to locate important information from the collected data
set for ongoing community enhancement projects, to highlight relevant community
assets, and to assist in identifying the steps to be taken based on the
concerns and areas of improvement identified by the community members.

combines the Earthmover's distance (EMD) with the diffusion maps method for
dimensionality reduction. We demonstrate the potential benefits of this
approach for learning shape spaces of proteins and other flexible
macromolecules using a simulated dataset of 3-D density maps that mimic the
non-uniform rotary motion of ATP synthase. Our results show that EMD-based
diffusion maps require far fewer samples to recover the intrinsic geometry than
the standard diffusion maps algorithm that is based on the Euclidean distance.
To reduce the computational burden of calculating the EMD for all volume pairs,
we employ a wavelet-based approximation to the EMD which reduces the
computation of the pairwise EMDs to a computation of pairwise weighted-$\ell_1$
distances between wavelet coefficient vectors.

authors in the field of the Prisoner's Dilemma using topic modeling and a graph
theoretic analysis of the co-authorship network. The analysis identified five
research topics in the Prisoner's Dilemma which have been relevant over the
course of time. These are human subject research, biological studies,
strategies, evolutionary dynamics on networks and modeling problems as a
Prisoner's Dilemma game. Moreover, the results demonstrated the Prisoner's
Dilemma is a field of continued interest, and that it is a collaborative field
compared to other game theoretic fields. The co-authorship network suggests
that authors are focused on their communities and that not many connections
across the communities are made. The most central authors of the network are
the authors connected to the main cluster. Through examining the networks of
topics, it was uncovered that the main cluster is characterised by the
collaboration of authors in a single topic.
  These findings add to the bibliometrics study in another field and present
new questions and avenues of research to understand the reasons for the
measured behaviours.

at a given level of expected return, has been advocated as a better performance
indicator compared to Sharpe and Sortino ratio as it depends on the full return
distribution and hence encapsulates all information about risk and return. We
compute Omega ratio for the normal distribution and show that under some
distribution symmetry assumptions, the Omega ratio is oversold as it does not
provide any additional information compared to Sharpe ratio. Indeed, for
returns that have elliptic distributions, we prove that the optimal portfolio
according to Omega ratio is the same as the optimal portfolio according to
Sharpe ratio. As elliptic distributions are a weak form of symmetric
distributions that generalized Gaussian distributions and encompass many fat
tail distributions, this reduces tremendously the potential interest for the
Omega ratio.
