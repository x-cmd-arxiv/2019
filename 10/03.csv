characteristics including hatespeech, abusive language, insults etc. that are
targeted to attack or abuse a specific group of people. Often such text is
written differently compared to traditional text such as news involving either
explicit mention of abusive words, obfuscated words and typological errors or
implicit abuse i.e., indicating or targeting negative stereotypes. Thus,
processing this text poses several robustness challenges when we apply natural
language processing techniques developed for traditional text. For example,
using word or token based models to process such text can treat two spelling
variants of a word as two different words. Following recent work, we analyze
how character, subword and byte pair encoding (BPE) models can be aid some of
the challenges posed by user generated text. In our work, we analyze the
effectiveness of each of the above techniques, compare and contrast various
word decomposition techniques when used in combination with others. We
experiment with finetuning large pretrained language models, and demonstrate
their robustness to domain shift by studying Wikipedia attack, toxicity and
Twitter hatespeech datasets

stably realizable controllers for a given network structure. Using this Youla
Operator State-Space (YOSS) framework, we show that if the structure satisfies
certain subspace like assumptions, then both stability and performance problems
can be formulated as convex optimization and more precisely as tractable
model-matching problems to any a priori accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the
structured controllers found from our approach can be stably realized over the

(QBF) is a vivid research area in both theory and practice. In the field of
parameterized algorithmics, the well-studied graph measure treewidth turned out
to be a successful parameter. A well-known result by Chen in parameterized
complexity is that QSAT when parameterized by the treewidth of the primal graph
of the input formula together with the quantifier depth of the formula is
fixed-parameter tractable. More precisely, the runtime of such an algorithm is
polynomial in the formula size and exponential in the treewidth, where the
exponential function in the treewidth is a tower, whose height is the
quantifier depth. A natural question is whether one can significantly improve
these results and decrease the tower while assuming the Exponential Time
Hypothesis (ETH). In the last years, there has been a growing interest in the
quest of establishing lower bounds under ETH, showing mostly problem-specific
lower bounds up to the third level of the polynomial hierarchy. Still, an
important question is to settle this as general as possible and to cover the
whole polynomial hierarchy. In this work, we show lower bounds based on the ETH
for arbitrary QBFs parameterized by treewidth (and quantifier depth). More
formally, we establish lower bounds for QSAT and treewidth, namely, that under
ETH there cannot be an algorithm that solves QSAT of quantifier depth i in
runtime significantly better than i-fold exponential in the treewidth and
polynomial in the input size. In doing so, we provide a versatile reduction
technique to compress treewidth that encodes the essence of dynamic programming
on arbitrary tree decompositions. Further, we describe a general methodology
for a more fine-grained analysis of problems parameterized by treewidth that
are at higher levels of the polynomial hierarchy.

campaign of a large number of AGNs requires an extensive amount of observing
time of medium to large size telescopes. As an alternative way, we present the
results of photometric RM with medium-band photometry. As the widths of
medium-band filters match well with the widths of AGN broad emission lines, the
medium-band observation with small telescopes can be a cost-effective way to
perform RM. We monitored five nearby AGNs with available spectroscopic RM
results showing days to weeks scale variability. Observations were performed
for ~3 months with an average of 3 days cadence using three medium-band filters

detectors with considerable sensitivity in the deci-Hz range such as the
DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) can observe
WD-WD mergers directly. Therefore, access to the deci-Hz band of GWs would
enable multi-messenger observations of Type Ia supernovae to determine their
progenitor and explosion mechanism. In this paper, we consider the event rate
of WD-WD mergers and minimum detection range to observe one WD-WD merger per
year, using a nearby galaxy catalog and the relation between the Ia supernova
and host galaxy. Furthermore, we calculate DECIGO's ability to localize WD-WD
mergers and to determine the masses of binary mergers. We estimate that the
deci-Hz GW observatory can detect GWs with amplitudes $h\sim10^{-20}[\rm
Hz^{-1/2}]$ at 0.01-0.1 Hz, which is 1000 times higher than the detection limit
of DECIGO. Assuming progenitors of Ia supernovae are merging WD-WD
($1M_{\odot}-0.8M_{\odot}$), DECIGO is expected to detect 6600 WD-WD mergers
within $z=0.08$, and identify the host galaxy of such WD-WD mergers within
$z\sim0.065$ using GW detection alone.

properties of either the data features or target change over time; evidence of
drift has appeared in search data, medical research, malware, web data, and
video. Drift adaptation has not yet been addressed in high dimensional, noisy,
low-context data such as streaming text, video, or images due to the unique
challenges these domains present. We present a two-fold approach to deal with
concept drift in these domains: a density-based clustering approach to deal
with virtual concept drift (change in statistical properties of features) and a
weak-supervision step to deal with real concept drift (change in statistical
properties of target). Our density-based clustering avoids problems posed by
the curse of dimensionality to create an evolving 'map' of the live data space,
thereby addressing virtual drift in features. Our weak-supervision step
leverages high-confidence labels (oracle or heuristic labels) to generate
weighted training sets to generalize and update existing deep learners to adapt
to changing decision boundaries (real drift) and create new deep learners for
unseen regions of the data space. Our results show that our two-fold approach
performs well with >90% precision in 2018, four years after initial deployment
in 2014, without any human intervention.

buildings and other geometries such as affine planes, from which we build
coherent configurations (also known as non-commutative association schemes).
The condition we require is that the graph be endowed with a certain distance
function, taking its values in the adjacency algebra (itself generated by the
adjacency operators). When all the edges are of the same colour, the condition
is equivalent to the graph being distance-regular, so our result is a
generalization of the classical fact that distance-regular graphs give rise to
association schemes.
  The Bose-Mesner algebra of the coherent configuration is then isomorphic to
the adjacency algebra of the graph. The latter is more easily computed, and
comes with a ""small"" set of generators, so we are able to produce examples of
Bose-Mesner algebras with particularly simple presentations.
  When a group acts ""strongly transitively"", in a certain sense, on a graph, we
show that a distance function as above exists canonically; moreover, when the
graph is (the chamber system of) a building, we show that strong transitivity
is equivalent to the usual condition involving pairs of incident chambers and
apartments.
  We study affine planes in detail. These are not buildings, yet the machinery
developed allows us to state and prove some results which are directly
analogous to classical facts in the theory of projective planes (which {\em
are} buildings). In particular, we prove that an affine plane with a group
acting strongly transitively on it must be Desarguesian.

state-of-the-art methods for these two quantities rely on 2D level-set tests
that are based on solving large eigenvalue problems. Consequently, these
methods are costly, i.e., $\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ work using dense eigensolvers, and
often multiple tests are needed before convergence. Divide-and-conquer
techniques have been proposed that reduce the work complexity to
$\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ on average and $\mathcal{O}(n^5)$ in the worst case, but
these variants are nevertheless still very expensive and can be numerically
unreliable. In contrast, our new interpolation-based globality certificates
perform level-set tests by building interpolant approximations to certain
one-variable continuous functions that are both relatively cheap and
numerically robust to evaluate. Our new approach has a $\mathcal{O}(kn^3)$ work
complexity and uses $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ memory, where $k$ is the number of
function evaluations necessary to build the interpolants. Not only is this
interpolation process mostly ""embarrassingly parallel,"" but also low-fidelity
approximations typically suffice for all but the final interpolant, which must
be built to high accuracy. Even without taking advantage of the aforementioned
parallelism, $k$ is sufficiently small that our new approach is generally
orders of magnitude faster than the previous state-of-the-art.

reduce this gap on the complexity of computing the largest bond and the largest

computing the largest bond of a graph tends to be harder than computing its

dual-use requirement leads to unique co-optimization challenges (e.g. shading,
soiling, spacing) that make module technology and farm topology choices
distinctly different from traditional solar farms. Here we compare the
performance of the traditional optimally-titled North/South (N/S) faced

the same energy output and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) compared

lower relative to that for the standard ground-mounted PV farms. Our results
explain the relative merits of the traditional mono facial vs. vertical
bifacial farms as a function of array density, acceptable PAR-deficit, and
energy production. The combined PAR/Energy yields for the vertical bifacial
farm may not always be superior, it could still be an attractive choice for
agrivoltaics due to its distinct advantages such as minimum land coverage,
least hindrance to the farm machinery and rainfall, inherent resilience to PV
soiling, easier cleaning and cost advantages due to potentially reduced

black hole horizons in string theory. In particular, we consider supersymmetric
horizons in the low energy limit of string theory known as supergravity and we
prove the $\textit{horizon conjecture}$ for a number of supergravity theories.
We first give important examples of symmetry enhancement in $D=4$ and the
mathematical preliminaries required for the analysis. Type IIA supergravity is
the low energy limit of $D=10$ IIA string theory, but also the dimensional
reduction of $D=11$ supergravity which itself the low energy limit of M-theory.
We prove that Killing horizons in IIA supergravity with compact spatial
sections preserve an even number of supersymmetries. By analyzing the global
properties of the Killing spinors, we prove that the near-horizon geometries
undergo a supersymmetry enhancement. This follows from a set of generalized
Lichnerowicz-type theorems we establish, together with an index theory
argument. We also show that the symmetry algebra of horizons with non-trivial
fluxes includes an $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$ subalgebra. As an
intermediate step in the proof, we also demonstrate new Lichnerowicz type
theorems for spin bundle connections whose holonomy is contained in a general
linear group. We prove the same result for Roman's Massive IIA supergravity. We
also consider the near-horizon geometry of supersymmetric extremal black holes
in un-gauged and gauged 5-dimensional supergravity, coupled to abelian vector
multiplets. We consider important examples in $D=5$ such as the BMPV and
supersymmetric black ring solution, and investigate the near-horizon geometry
to show the enhancement of the symmetry algebra of the Killing vectors. We
repeat a similar analysis as above to prove the horizon conjecture. We also
investigate the conditions on the geometry of the spatial horizon section
$\cal{S}$.

$g_{\rho\pi\pi}$. By combining the scattering phase shifts with the decay
matrix element of the vector current, we calculate the timelike pion form

of the form factor in terms of the resonance parameters. In addition, we fit
our data for the form factor to the functional form suggested by the Omn\`es

vector correlator, which is dominated by the two-pion channel. We reconstruct
the long-distance part in two ways: one based on the finite-volume energies and
matrix elements and the other based on $F_\pi$. It is shown that this part can
be accurately constrained using the reconstructions, which has important
consequences for lattice calculations of the hadronic vacuum polarisation

geometry, the requirement of covariant conservation of matter invokes torsion
of space-time. In the Friedman model this leads to a scalar field built from
contortion and the metric with the property of dark energy, which transforms
the cosmological constant to a time-dependent function. Moreover, the
quadratic, scale invariant Riemann-Cartan term in the CCGG Lagrangian endows
space-time with kinetic energy, and in the field equations adds a geometrical
curvature correction to Einstein gravity. Applying in the Friedman model the
standard $\Lambda$CDM parameter set, those equations yield a cosmological field
depending just on one additional, dimensionless ``deformation'' parameter of
the theory that determines the strength of the quadratic term, viz. the
deviation from the Einstein-Hilbert ansatz. Moreover, the apparent curvature of
the universe differs from the actual curvature parameter of the metric. The
numerical analysis in that parameter space yields three cosmology types: (I) A
bounce universe starting off from a finite scale followed by a steady
inflation, (II) a singular Big Bang universe undergoing a secondary
inflation-deceleration phase, and (III) a solution similar to standard
cosmology but with a different temporal profile. The common feature of all
scenarios is the graceful exit to the current dark energy era. The value of the
deformation parameter can be deduced by comparing theoretical calculations with
observations, namely with the SNeIa Hubble diagram and the deceleration
parameter. That comparison implies a considerable admixture of scale invariant
quadratic gravity to Einstein gravity. This theory also sheds new light on the

the formation of complex organic molecules, (ii) the outer midplane with higher

property of having a homomorphism to a fixed edge-coloured graph $H$. The
question we are interested in is: given an edge-coloured graph $G$, can we
perform $k$ graph operations so that the resulting graph admits a homomorphism
to $H$? The operations we consider are vertex-deletion, edge-deletion and
switching (an operation that permutes the colours of the edges incident to a
given vertex). Switching plays an important role in the theory of signed
graphs, that are 2-edge-coloured graphs whose colours are the signs $+$ and
$-$. We denote the corresponding problems (parameterized by $k$) by
VD-$H$-COLOURING, ED-$H$-COLOURING and SW-$H$-COLOURING. These problems
generalise $H$-COLOURING (to decide if an input graph admits a homomorphism to
a fixed target $H$).
  Our main focus is when $H$ is an edge-coloured graph with at most two
vertices, a case that is already interesting as it includes problems such as
VERTEX COVER, ODD CYCLE RANSVERSAL and EDGE BIPARTIZATION. For such a graph
$H$, we give a P/NP-c complexity dichotomy for VD-$H$-COLOURING,
ED-$H$-COLOURING and SW-$H$-COLOURING. We then address their parameterized

paper, we present optimistic value iteration, a new sound approach that
leverages value iteration's ability to usually deliver tight lower bounds: we
obtain a lower bound via standard value iteration, use the result to ""guess"" an
upper bound, and prove the latter's correctness. Optimistic value iteration is
easy to implement, does not require extra precomputations or a priori state

black hole growth across cosmic time in cosmological simulations and for
smaller scale simulations of AGN feedback. In nature, however, there will be
inhomogenous distributions of rotational velocity and density along the outer
radius ($R_o$) marking the sphere of influence of a black hole. While there
have been many studies of how the Bondi solution changes with a prescribed
angular momentum boundary condition, they have all assumed a constant density
at $R_o$. In this Letter, we show that a non-uniform density at $R_o$ causes a
meridional flow and due to conservation of angular momentum, the Bondi solution
qualitatively changes into an inflow-outflow solution. Using physical
arguments, we analytically identify the critical logarithmic density gradient
$|\partial{\ln{\rho}}/\partial{\theta}|$ above which this change of the
solution occurs. For realistic $R_o$, this critical gradient is less than 0.01

constant at nearly the Bondi rate $\dot{M}_B$, while the outflow rate can
greatly exceed $\dot{M}_B$.

triaxial morphologies, while their emission profiles are best fit by a Sersic

of triaxiality and $n\sim1$ Sersic index are characteristic of bars and we
suggest that the bulk of the 870$\mu$m dust continuum emission in the central

870$\mu$m maps we recover faint extended dust continuum emission on $\sim4$kpc
scales which contributes $13\pm1$% of the total 870$\mu$m emission. The scale
of this extended emission is similar to that seen for the molecular gas and
rest-frame optical light in these systems, suggesting that it represents an
extended dust and gas disc at radii larger than the more active bar component.
Including this component in our estimated size of the sources we derive a
typical effective radius of $\simeq0.15''\pm0.05''$ or $1.2\pm0.4$kpc. Our
results suggest that kpc-scale bars are ubiquitous features of high
star-formation rate systems at $z\gg1$, while these systems also contain
fainter and more extended gas and stellar envelopes. We suggest that these
features, seen some $10-12$Gyrs ago, represent the formation phase of the

half is found in the ISM or stars of the central galaxy by z=0 in Mh(z=2) ~

heavier neutrinos into lighter ones. We investigate the impact of two-body
decays of neutrinos on the neutronization burst of a core-collapse supernova --
the large burst of $\nu_e$ during the first 25 ms post core-bounce. In the
models we consider, the $\nu_e$, produced mainly as a $\nu_3\,(\nu_2)$ in the
normal (inverted) mass ordering, are allowed to decay to $\nu_1\,(\nu_3)$ or
$\bar{\nu}_1\,(\bar{\nu}_3)$, and an almost massless scalar. These decays can
lead to the appearance of a neutronization peak for a normal mass ordering or
the disappearance of the same peak for the inverted one, thereby allowing one
mass ordering to mimic the other. Simulating supernova-neutrino data at the
Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) and the Hyper-Kamiokande (HK)

that, if the mass ordering is known, and depending on the nature of the Physics
responsible for the neutrino decay, DUNE is sensitive to lifetimes $\tau/m
\lesssim 10^6$ s/eV for a galactic SN sufficiently close-by (around 10 kpc),

sensitivities are far superior to existing limits from solar-system-bound

universe contains not only visible matter but also dark matter. In order to
suppress the couplings between the dark and visible sectors, a standard
assumption is that these two sectors communicate only through a mediator. In
this paper we make a simple but important observation: if the dark sector
contains multiple components with similar quantum numbers, then this mediator
also generically gives rise to dark-sector decays, with heavier dark components
decaying to lighter components. This in turn can even give rise to relatively
long dark decay chains, with each step of the decay chain also producing
visible matter. The visible byproducts of such mediator-induced decay chains
can therefore serve as a unique signature of such scenarios. In order to
examine this possibility more concretely, we examine a scenario in which a
multi-component dark sector is connected through a mediator to Standard-Model
quarks. We then demonstrate that such a scenario gives rise to multi-jet
collider signatures, and we examine the properties of such jets at both the
parton and detector levels. Within relatively large regions of parameter space,
we find that such multi-jet signatures are not excluded by existing monojet and
multi-jet searches. Such decay cascades therefore represent a potential
discovery route for multi-component dark sectors at current and future

with a recent quenching of the star formation. We compare the properties of
these 10 galaxies with those of a control sample of 8 MaNGA galaxies with
ongoing star formation in the same stellar mass, redshift and gas-phase
metallicity range. The quenching regions found are located between 0.5 and 1.1
effective radii from the centre. This result is supported by the analysis of
the average radial profile of the ionisation parameter, which reaches a minimum
at the same radii, while the one of the star-forming sample shows an almost
flat trend. These quenching regions occupy a total area between 15\% and 45\%
of our galaxies. Moreover, the average radial profile of the star formation
rate surface density of our sample is lower and flatter than that of the
control sample, at any radii, suggesting a systematic suppression of the star
formation in the inner part of our galaxies. Finally, the radial profile of
gas-phase metallicity of the two samples have a similar slope and
normalisation. Our results cannot be ascribed to a difference in the intrinsic

quantum gravitational theory in an infinite distance limit of its moduli space
either decompactifies, or reduces to an asymptotically tensionless, weakly
coupled string theory. We support our claim by classifying, as special cases,
the behaviour of M-Theory and Type IIA string theory compactifications on
Calabi-Yau three-folds at infinite distances in Kahler moduli space. The
analysis comprises three parts: We first classify the possible infinite
distance limits in the classical Kahler moduli space of a Calabi-Yau
three-fold. Each such limit at finite volume is characterized by a universal
fibration structure, for which the generic fiber shrinking in the limit is
either an elliptic curve, a K3 surface, or an Abelian surface. In the second
part we focus on M-Theory and investigate the nature of the towers of
asymptotically massless states that arise from branes wrapped on the shrinking
fibers. Depending on which of the three classes of fibrations are considered,
we obtain decompactification to F-Theory, or a theory with a unique
asymptotically tensionless, weakly coupled heterotic or Type II string,
respectively. The latter probes a dual D-manifold which is in general
non-geometric. In addition to the intrinsic string excitations, towers of
states from M2-branes along non-contractible curves become light and correspond
to further wrapping and winding modes of the tensionless heterotic or Type II
string. In the third part of the analysis, we consider Type IIA string theory
on Calabi-Yau three-folds and show that quantum effects obstruct taking finite
volume infinite distance limits in the Kahler moduli space. The only possible
infinite distance limit which is not a decompactification limit involves
K3-fibrations with string scale fiber volume and gives rise to an emergent
tensionless heterotic string.

by a `fractonic' model of quantum dynamics constrained to conserve both charge
and dipole moment. We show how the Hilbert space of the fractonic model
dynamically fractures into disconnected emergent subsectors within a particular
charge and dipole symmetry sector. This shattering can occur in arbitrary
spatial dimensions. A large number of the emergent subsectors, exponentially
many in system volume, have dimension one and exhibit strictly localized
quantum dynamics---even in the absence of spatial disorder and in the presence
of temporal noise. Other emergent subsectors display non-trivial dynamics and
may be constructed by embedding finite sized non-trivial blocks into the
localized subspace. While `fractonic' models provide a particularly clean
realization, the shattering phenomenon is more general, as we discuss. We also
discuss how the key phenomena may be readily observed in near term ultracold

cosmology, and enlarging the sample size of lensed quasars is important for
multiple studies. In this work, we develop a lens search algorithm for
four-image (quad) lensed quasars based on their time variability. In the
development of the lens search algorithm, we constructed a pipeline simulating
multi-epoch images of lensed quasars in cadenced surveys, accounting for quasar
variabilities, quasar hosts, lens galaxies, and the PSF variation. Applying the
simulation pipeline to the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) transient survey, we
generated HSC-like difference images of the mock lensed quasars from Oguri &
Marshall's lens catalog. We further developed a lens search algorithm that
picks out variable objects as lensed quasar candidates based on their spatial
extent in the difference images. We tested our lens search algorithm with the
mock lensed quasars and variable objects from the HSC transient survey. Using
difference images from multiple epochs, our lens search algorithm achieves a
high true-positive rate (TPR) of 90.1% and a low false-positive rate (FPR) of
2.3% for the bright quads with wide separation. With a preselection of the
number of blobs in the difference image, we obtain a TPR of 97.6% and a FPR of
2.6% for the bright quads with wide separation. Even when difference images are
only available in one single epoch, our lens search algorithm can still detect
the bright quads with wide separation at high TPR of 97.6% and low FPR of 2.4%
in the optimal seeing scenario, and at TPR of $\sim94%$ and FPR of $\sim5%$ in
typical scenarios. Therefore, our lens search algorithm is promising and is
applicable to ongoing and upcoming cadenced surveys, particularly the HSC
transient survey and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, for
finding new lensed quasar systems. [abridged]

with respect to a receiver will produce a signal that appears to change its
frequency over time. This effect, commonly produced in astrophysical situations
where orbital and rotational motions are ubiquitous, is called a drift rate. In
radio SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) research, it is unknown a
priori which frequency a signal is being sent at, or even if there will be any
drift rate at all besides motions within the solar system. Therefore a range of
potential drift rates need to be individually searched, and a maximum drift
rate needs to be chosen. The middle of this range is zero, indicating no
acceleration, but the absolute value for the limits remains unconstrained. A
balance must be struck between computational time and the possibility of
excluding a signal from an ETI. In this work, we examine physical
considerations that constrain a maximum drift rate and highlight the importance
of this problem in any narrowband SETI search. We determine that a normalized
drift rate of 200 nHz (eg. 200 Hz/s at 1 GHz) is a generous, physically
motivated guideline for the maximum drift rate that should be applied to future
narrowband SETI projects if computational capabilities permit.

produce radio to optical-infrared synchrotron emission. In most BHXBs, an
infrared (IR) excess (above the disc component) is observed when the jet is
present in the hard spectral state. We investigate why some BHXBs have
prominent IR excesses and some do not, quantified by the amplitude of the IR
quenching or recovery over the transition from/to the hard state. We find that
the amplitude of the IR excess can be explained by inclination dependent
beaming of the jet synchrotron emission, and the projected area of the
accretion disc. Furthermore, we see no correlation between the expected and the
observed IR excess for Lorentz factor 1, which is strongly supportive of
relativistic beaming of the IR emission, confirming that the IR excess is
produced by synchrotron emission in a relativistic outflow. Using the amplitude
of the jet fade and recovery over state transitions and the known orbital
parameters, we constrain for the first time the bulk Lorentz factor range of
compact jets in several BHXBs (with all the well-constrained Lorentz factors
lying in the range of $\Gamma$ = 1.3 - 3.5). Under the assumption that the
Lorentz factor distribution of BHXB jets is a power-law, we find that
N($\Gamma$) $\propto \Gamma^{ -1.88^{+0.27}_{-0.34}}$. We also find that the
very high amplitude IR fade/recovery seen repeatedly in the BHXB GX 339-4
favors a low inclination angle ($< 15^\circ$) of the jet.

without quenched disorder: one such proposal is Stark MBL in which small
perturbations to a strong linear potential yield localization. However, as with
conventional MBL, it is challenging to experimentally distinguish between
non-interacting localization and true MBL. In this paper we show that several
existing experimental probes, designed specifically to differentiate between
these scenarios, work similarly in the Stark MBL setting. In particular we show
that a modified spin-echo response (DEER) shows clear signs of a power-law
decay for Stark MBL while quickly saturating for disorder-free Wannier-Stark
localization. Further, we observe the characteristic logarithmic-in-time
spreading of quantum mutual information in the Stark MBL regime, and an absence
of spreading in a non-interacting Stark-localized system. We also show that
there are no significant differences in several existing MBL measures for a
system consisting of softcore bosons with repulsive on-site interactions.
Lastly we discuss why curvature or small disorder are needed for an accurate
reproduction of MBL phenomenology, and how this may be illustrated in
experiment. This also connects with recent progress on Hilbert space
fragmentation in ""fractonic"" models with conserved dipole moment, and we
suggest this as an auspicious platform for experimental investigations of these

based optimizers typically require the evaluation of expectation values with
respect to the outcome of parameterized quantum circuits. In this work, we
explore the consequences of the prior observation that estimation of these
quantities on quantum hardware results in a form of stochastic gradient descent
optimization. We formalize this notion, which allows us to show that in many
relevant cases, including VQE, QAOA and certain quantum classifiers, estimating
expectation values with $k$ measurement outcomes results in optimization
algorithms whose convergence properties can be rigorously well understood, for
any value of $k$. In fact, even using single measurement outcomes for the
estimation of expectation values is sufficient. Moreover, in many settings the
required gradients can be expressed as linear combinations of expectation
values -- originating, e.g., from a sum over local terms of a Hamiltonian, a
parameter shift rule, or a sum over data-set instances -- and we show that in
these cases $k$-shot expectation value estimation can be combined with sampling
over terms of the linear combination, to obtain ""doubly stochastic"" gradient
descent optimizers. For all algorithms we prove convergence guarantees,
providing a framework for the derivation of rigorous optimization results in
the context of near-term quantum devices. Additionally, we explore numerically
these methods on benchmark VQE, QAOA and quantum-enhanced machine learning
tasks and show that treating the stochastic settings as hyper-parameters allows
for state-of-the-art results with significantly fewer circuit executions and
measurements.

of BERT's commonsense representation abilities. First, we probe BERT's ability
to classify various object attributes, demonstrating that BERT shows a strong

still deficient in many areas. Next, we show that, by augmenting BERT's
pretraining data with additional data related to the deficient attributes, we
are able to improve performance on a downstream commonsense reasoning task

been a notorious struggle for social media platforms. Further to the efforts of
reducing exposure to misinformation on social media, purveyors of fake news
have begun to masquerade as satire sites to avoid being demoted. In this work,
we address the challenge of automatically classifying fake news versus satire.
Previous work have studied whether fake news and satire can be distinguished
based on language differences. Contrary to fake news, satire stories are
usually humorous and carry some political or social message. We hypothesize
that these nuances could be identified using semantic and linguistic cues.
Consequently, we train a machine learning method using semantic representation,
with a state-of-the-art contextual language model, and with linguistic features
based on textual coherence metrics. Empirical evaluation attests to the merits
of our approach compared to the language-based baseline and sheds light on the
nuances between fake news and satire. As avenues for future work, we consider
studying additional linguistic features related to the humor aspect, and
enriching the data with current news events, to help identify a political or

methods for handling missing data under the true model. It is also
well-understood that design-based estimators are robust methods that do not
require accurately modeling the missing data; however, they can be inefficient.
In any applied setting, it is difficult to know whether a missing data model
may be good enough to win the bias-efficiency trade-off. Raking of weights is
one approach that relies on constructing an auxiliary variable from data
observed on the full cohort, which is then used to adjust the weights for the
usual Horvitz-Thompson estimator. Computing the optimally efficient raking
estimator requires evaluating the expectation of the efficient score given the
full cohort data, which is generally infeasible. We demonstrate multiple
imputation (MI) as a practical method to compute a raking estimator that will
be optimal. We compare this estimator to common parametric and semi-parametric
estimators, including standard multiple imputation. We show that while
estimators, such as the semi-parametric maximum likelihood and MI estimator,
obtain optimal performance under the true model, the proposed raking estimator
utilizing MI maintains a better robustness-efficiency trade-off even under mild
model misspecification. We also show that the standard raking estimator,
without MI, is often competitive with the optimal raking estimator. We
demonstrate these properties through several numerical examples and provide a
theoretical discussion of conditions for asymptotically superior relative
efficiency of the proposed raking estimator.

computational. We present the first time-dependent analysis of giant molecular
clouds in a Milky Way-like galaxy and an LMC-like dwarf galaxy of the FIRE-2
(Feedback In Realistic Environments) simulation suite, which have sufficient
resolution to predict the bulk properties of GMCs in cosmological galaxy
formation self-consistently. We show explicitly that the majority of star
formation outside the galactic center occurs within self-gravitating gas
structures that have properties consistent with observed bound GMCs. We find
that the typical cloud bulk properties such as mass and surface density do not
vary more than a factor of 2 in any systematic way after the first Gyr of
cosmic evolution within a given galaxy from its progenitor. While the median
properties are constant, the tails of the distributions can briefly undergo
drastic changes, which can produce very massive and dense self-gravitating gas
clouds. Once the galaxy forms, we identify only two systematic trends in bulk
properties over cosmic time: a steady increase in metallicity produced by
previous stellar populations and a weak decrease in bulk cloud temperatures.
With the exception of metallicity we find no significant differences in cloud
properties between the Milky Way-like and dwarf galaxies. These results have
important implications for cosmological star and star cluster formation and put
especially strong constraints on theories relating the stellar initial mass

problems, boosting the hope to find approximate solutions to problems that now
are considered unsolvable. Earthquake prediction, the Grail of Seismology, is,
in this context of continuous exciting discoveries, an obvious choice for deep
learning exploration. We review the entire literature of artificial neural
network (ANN) applications for earthquake prediction (77 articles, 1994-2019
period) and find two emerging trends: an increasing interest in this domain,
and a complexification of ANN models over time, towards deep learning. Despite
apparent positive results observed in this corpus, we demonstrate that simpler
models seem to offer similar predictive powers, if not better ones. Due to the
structured, tabulated nature of earthquake catalogues, and the limited number
of features so far considered, simpler and more transparent machine learning
models seem preferable at the present stage of research. Those baseline models
follow first physical principles and are consistent with the known empirical
laws of Statistical Seismology, which have minimal abilities to predict large
earthquakes.

significant challenges when generating long-term behaviors: how should we
specify the factors of variation to control, and how can we ensure that the
generated behavior faithfully demonstrates combinatorially many styles? We
leverage programmatic labeling functions to specify controllable styles, and
derive a formal notion of style-consistency as a learning objective, which can
then be solved using conventional policy learning approaches. We evaluate our
framework using demonstrations from professional basketball players and agents
in the MuJoCo physics environment, and show that existing approaches that do
not explicitly enforce style-consistency fail to generate diverse behaviors

the characteristics of social media graphs differ from those seen in most
popular benchmark datasets. Social networks tend to be large and sparse, while
benchmarks are small and dense. Classically, large and sparse networks are
analyzed by studying the distribution of local properties. Inspired by this, we
introduce Graph-Hist: an end-to-end architecture that extracts a graph's latent
local features, bins nodes together along 1-D cross sections of the feature
space, and classifies the graph based on this multi-channel histogram. We show
that Graph-Hist improves state of the art performance on true social media
benchmark datasets, while still performing well on other benchmarks. Finally,
we demonstrate Graph-Hist's performance by conducting bot detection in social
media. While sophisticated bot and cyborg accounts increasingly evade
traditional detection methods, they leave artificial artifacts in their
conversational graph that are detected through graph classification. We apply
Graph-Hist to classify these conversational graphs. In the process, we confirm
that social media graphs are different than most baselines and that Graph-Hist
outperforms existing bot-detection models.

where individual features across all samples are made available to algorithms
in a streaming fashion. In this work, firstly, we assert that OSFS's main
assumption of having data from all the samples available at runtime is
unrealistic and introduce a new setting where features and samples are streamed
concurrently called OSFS with Streaming Samples (OSFS-SS). Secondly, the
primary OSFS method, SAOLA utilizes an unbounded mutual information measure and
requires multiple comparison steps between the stored and incoming feature sets
to evaluate a feature's importance. We introduce Geometric Online Adaption, an
algorithm that requires relatively less feature comparison steps and uses a
bounded conditional geometric dependency measure. Our algorithm outperforms
several OSFS baselines including SAOLA on a variety of datasets. We also extend
SAOLA to work in the OSFS-SS setting and show that GOA continues to achieve the
best results. Thirdly, the current paradigm of the OSFS algorithm comparison is
flawed. Algorithms are measured by comparing the number of features used and
the accuracy obtained by the learner, two properties that are fundamentally at
odds with one another. Without fixing a limit on either of these properties,
the qualities of features obtained by different algorithms are incomparable. We
try to rectify this inconsistency by fixing the maximum number of features
available to the learner and comparing algorithms in terms of their accuracy.
Additionally, we characterize the behaviour of SAOLA and GOA on feature sets
derived from popular deep convolutional featurizers.

self-consistent 3D MHD model (Bifrost) and show that this relationship tends to
P ~ B^{2.9+-0.1} based on the visible portions of the sample of open-field flux

scatter corresponds to the strong meandering of the open-field flux tubes in

increasing interest as an alternative material for energy harvesters, sensors,

microscopy (PFM) to resolve piezo-responses at the nanoscale, several
difficulties arise when the measurements are performed on low piezo-coefficient
materials due to various artifacts. This work shows that semi-quantitative PFM
on low piezo-coefficient III-Nitrides can be achieved in high-aspect-ratio
nanostructures such as nanowires or nanorods. For conventional bulks and thin
films, accurate determination of their piezoresponses is limited because of
clamping and bending effects which can occur simultaneously during PFM
measurements. While the clamping effect only reduces the piezoresponse
amplitude, the bending motion either increases or decreases this amplitude and
can also rotate the phase by 180{\deg}. Improved electric field distribution in
nanowires minimizes both artifacts, allowing correct determinations of crystal
polarities and piezo-coefficients. In contrast to the reports in the

relativistic covariance was achieved by imposing constraints in the form of
Poisson brackets and of intial conditions to be satisfied by a set of local

domain the classical framework that originated with Dirac and was later
developed by Teitelboim and Kuchar. In the present work the ED of quantum
fields is extended further by allowing the geometry of spacetime to fully

recent work. The controller uses attention to read from and write to the
working memory. Attention allows the controller to read specific information
that is relevant and update its working memory with information based on its
relevance. The retrieved information is used to modify the final control input
computed by the controller. We showed that this modification speeds up
learning. In the above work, we used a soft-attention mechanism for the
adaptive controller. Controllers that use soft attention or hard attention
mechanisms are limited either because they can forget the information or fail
to shift attention when the information they are reading becomes less relevant.
We propose an attention mechanism that comprises of (i) a hard attention
mechanism and additionally (ii) an attention reallocation mechanism. The
attention reallocation enables the controller to reallocate attention to a
different location when the relevance of the location it is reading from
diminishes. The reallocation also ensures that the information stored in the
memory before the shift in attention is retained which can be lost in both soft
and hard attention mechanisms. We illustrate through detailed simulations of
various scenarios for two link robot and three link robot arm systems we
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed attention mechanism.

electrons. In this paper, we study the competition of beam relaxation due to
electron-electron (e-e) collisions and development of plasma beam instability
in graphene. We find that unstable plasma mode associated with a beam is
stabilized already by weak e-e collisions. At intermediate e-e collision
frequency, the instability re-appears at the ordinary graphene plasmon mode.
Such instability is interpreted as viscous transfer of momentum from beam to 2d

The use of a rectangle blanket is a widely considered strategy for speeding-up

rectangles nor the image have to be fully covered by the other, the blanket
becomes more precise as the non-overlapping area of the image and the blanket
decreases. In this work, we focus on the rectangle blanket problem, which
involves the determination of an optimum blanket minimizing the non-overlapping
area with a given image subject to an upper bound on the total number of
rectangles the blanket can include. This problem has similarities with
rectangle covering, rectangle partitioning and cutting / packing problems. The
image replaces an irregular master object by an approximating set of smaller

blanket, is neither restricted to remain entirely within the master object, nor
required to cover the master object completely. We first develop a binary

information erasure and entanglement swapping). The photon which-path

tunable under the homodyne detection scheme we discuss, at best generating
equivalent average entanglement dynamics as in the comparable photodetection
case. In addition to deriving this known equivalence, we extend past analyses

planning for target tracking. But the current attack-robust algorithms are
centralized. In this paper, we propose a general-purpose distributed algorithm

it Distributed Robust Maximization (DRM). DRM proposes a divide-and-conquer
approach that distributively partitions the problem among cliques of robots.
Then, the cliques optimize in parallel, independently of each other. We prove
DRM achieves a close-to-optimal performance. We demonstrate DRM's performance
in both Gazebo and MATLAB simulations, in scenarios of active target tracking
with swarms of robots. In the simulations, DRM achieves computational
speed-ups, being 1-2 orders faster than the centralized algorithms; yet, it
nearly matches the tracking performance of the centralized counterparts. Since,
DRM overestimates the number of attacks in each clique, in this paper we also
introduce an Improved Distributed Robust Maximization (IDRM) algorithm. IDRM
infers the number of attacks in each clique less conservatively than DRM by
leveraging 3-hop neighboring communications. We verify IDRM improves DRM's

energetic particles (SEPs) has grown into an extensive field that probes the
solar corona and the physical processes of SEP acceleration and transport.
Underlying SEPs are the abundances of the solar corona, which differ from
photospheric abundances as a function of the first ionization potentials (FIPs)
of the elements. The FIP-dependence of SEPs also differs from that of the solar
wind; each has a different magnetic environment where low-FIP ions and high-FIP
neutral atoms rise toward the corona. Two major sources generate SEPs: The
small ""impulsive"" SEP events are associated with magnetic reconnection in solar
jets that produce 1000-fold enhancements from H to Pb as a function of
mass-to-charge ratio A/Q, and also 1000-fold enhancements in 3He/4He produced
by resonant wave-particle interactions. In large ""gradual"" events, SEPs are
accelerated at shock waves driven out from the Sun by wide, fast coronal mass
ejections (CMEs). A/Q dependence of ion transport allows us to estimate Q and
hence the source plasma temperature T. Weaker shock waves favor reacceleration
of suprathermal ions accumulated from earlier impulsive SEP events, along with
protons from the ambient plasma. In strong shocks the ambient plasma dominates.
Ions from impulsive sources have T ~ 3 MK; those from ambient coronal plasma
have T = 1 - 2 MK. These FIP- and A/Q-dependences explore complex new
interactions in the corona and in SEP sources.

of copyrighted material piracy. In order to detect illegal use or distribution
of data, digital watermarking has been proposed as a suitable tool. It protects
the copyright of digital content by embedding imperceptible information into
the data in the presence of an adversary. The goal of the adversary is to
remove the copyrighted content of the data. Therefore, an efficient
watermarking framework must be robust to multiple image-processing operations
known as attacks that can alter embedded copyright information. Another line of
research \textit{adversarial machine learning} also tackles with similar
problems to guarantee robustness to imperceptible perturbations of the input.
In this work, we propose to apply robust optimization from adversarial machine
learning to improve the robustness of a CNN-based watermarking framework. Our
experimental results on the COCO dataset show that the robustness of a
watermarking framework can be improved by utilizing robust optimization in
training.

robust deep learning models, they are exploring approaches to monetize their

promising, but requires a robust tool for owners to claim ownership of models,
i.e. a watermark. Unfortunately, current designs have not been able to address
piracy attacks, where third parties falsely claim model ownership by embedding
their own ""pirate watermarks"" into an already-watermarked model. We observe
that resistance to piracy attacks is fundamentally at odds with the current use
of incremental training to embed watermarks into models. In this work, we
propose null embedding, a new way to build piracy-resistant watermarks into
DNNs that can only take place at a model's initial training. A null embedding
takes a bit string (watermark value) as input, and builds strong dependencies
between the model's normal classification accuracy and the watermark. As a
result, attackers cannot remove an embedded watermark via tuning or incremental
training, and cannot add new pirate watermarks to already watermarked models.
We empirically show that our proposed watermarks achieve piracy resistance and
other watermark properties, over a wide range of tasks and models. Finally, we
explore a number of adaptive counter-measures, and show our watermark remains
robust against a variety of model modifications, including model fine-tuning,
compression, and existing methods to detect/remove backdoors. Our watermarked

There are at least two different types of such junctions -- those that carry

superconducting electrodes, and those that convert spin-singlet to spin-triplet
supercurrent in the middle of the device. In this paper we compare the

spin-singlet junctions need only two ferromagnetic layers to function, the
spin-triplet junctions require at least three. In the devices demonstrated to
date, the spin-singlet junctions have considerably larger critical current
densities than the spin-triplet devices. On the other hand, the spin-triplet
devices have less stringent constraints on the thicknesses of the F layers,

for constructing turbulence models for Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS)

proposed that combines an ML algorithm with transport equations of a
conventional turbulence model. This framework maintains a consistent procedure
for obtaining the input features of an ML model in both the training and
predicting stages, ensuring a built-in reproducibility. The effective form of
the closure term is discussed to determine suitable target variables for the ML
algorithm, and the multi-valued problem of existing constitutive theory is
studied to establish a proper regression system for ML algorithms. The
developed ML model is trained under a cross-case strategy with data from
turbulent channel flows at three Reynolds numbers and \textit{a posteriori}
simulations of channel flows show that the framework is able to predict both
the mean flow field and turbulent variables accurately. Interpolation tests for
the channel flow show the proposed framework can reliably predict flow features
that lie between the minimum and maximum Reynolds numbers associated with the
training data. A further test related to the flow over periodic hills also
demonstrates a better result than a traditional turbulence model, indicating a
promising predictive capability of the developed ML model for separated flow
even though the model is only trained with planar channel flow data.

to the minimal number of additional, non-standard neutrinos. We show in
numerical analysis that taking into account present experimental precision and
fits to different neutrino mass splitting schemes, it is not possible to
distinguish, on the level of 3-dimensional mixing matrices, between two and
three extra neutrino states. It means that in 3+2 and 3+3 neutrino mixing
scenarios, using the so-called $\alpha$ parametrization, ranges of non-unitary
mixings are the same. However, on the level of a complete unitary 3+1 neutrino
mixing matrix, using the dilation procedure and the Cosine-Sine decomposition,
we were able to shrink bounds for the ""light-heavy"" mixing matrix elements. For
instance, in the so-called seesaw mass scheme, a new upper limit on $| U_{e4} |

matter (DM) paradigm, a popular remedy is to introduce a strong DM
self-interaction which can be generated nonperturbatively by a MeV-scale light
mediator. However, if such the mediator is unstable and decays into SM
particles, the model is severely constrained by the DM direct and indirect
detection experiments. In the present paper, we study a model of a
self-interacting fermionic DM, endowed with a light stable scalar mediator. In
this model, the DM relic abundance is dominated by the fermionic DM particle
which is generated mainly via the freeze-out of its annihilations to the stable
mediator. Since this channel is invisible, the DM indirect detection
constraints should be greatly relaxed. Furthermore, the direct detection
signals are suppressed to an unobservable level since fermionic DM scatterings
with a nucleon appear at one-loop level. By further studying the bounds from
the CMB and BBN on the visible channels involving the dark sector, we show that
there is a large parameter space which can generate appropriate DM
self-interactions at dwarf galaxy scales, while remaining compatible with other

train a deep convolutional network for semantic segmentation on the target data

interstellar line absorption along 62 sightlines and show that in the direction
of $\epsilon$~CMa, $\beta$~CMa, and Sirius~B the neutral hydrogen column
density from the center of the LIC is a minimum. We call this region the
``hydrogen hole''. In this direction, the presence of Blue cloud absorption and
the absence of LIC absorption can be simply explained by the Blue cloud lying
just outside of the heliosphere. We propose that the outer edge of the Blue

the H~II region. We find that the vectors of neutral and ionized helium flowing

nearby intercloud gas is consistent with ionization by $\epsilon$~CMa and other
stellar sources without requiring additional sources of ionization or million

often achieves higher accuracy with the same capacity. In this paper, we aim to
provide a theoretical understanding on what mainly helps with the distillation.
Our answer is ""early stopping"". Assuming that the teacher network is
overparameterized, we argue that the teacher network is essentially harvesting
dark knowledge from the data via early stopping. This can be justified by a new
concept, {Anisotropic Information Retrieval (AIR)}, which means that the neural
network tends to fit the informative information first and the non-informative
information (including noise) later. Motivated by the recent development on
theoretically analyzing overparameterized neural networks, we can characterize
AIR by the eigenspace of the Neural Tangent Kernel(NTK). AIR facilities a new
understanding of distillation. With that, we further utilize distillation to
refine noisy labels. We propose a self-distillation algorithm to sequentially
distill knowledge from the network in the previous training epoch to avoid
memorizing the wrong labels. We also demonstrate, both theoretically and
empirically, that self-distillation can benefit from more than just early
stopping. Theoretically, we prove convergence of the proposed algorithm to the
ground truth labels for randomly initialized overparameterized neural networks
in terms of $\ell_2$ distance, while the previous result was on convergence in
$0$-$1$ loss. The theoretical result ensures the learned neural network enjoy a
margin on the training data which leads to better generalization. Empirically,
we achieve better testing accuracy and entirely avoid early stopping which
makes the algorithm more user-friendly.

linear combination between labeled salient objects and new backgrounds,
generated by removing the original salient object in a process known as image
inpainting. Our proposed technique allows for more precise control of the
object's position and size while preserving background information. Aiming to

present auxiliary-field lattice Monte Carlo simulations using a novel lattice
interaction which accelerates the approach to the continuum limit, thereby
allowing for robust calculations of these difficult observables. As a benchmark
test we compute the ground state energy of 33 spin-up and 33 spin-down

off-diagonal long-range order in the two-body density matrix. We find that the

learning as a powerful technique to integrate multimodality, multifidelity

opportunity in this regard. However, classical machine learning techniques
often ignore the fundamental laws of physics and result in ill-posed problems

reduction of the problem size. However, temporal reduction accompanied by the
spatial reduction can further reduce the problem size without losing accuracy
much, which results in a considerably more speed-up than the spatial reduction
only. Recently, a novel space-time reduced order model for dynamical problems
has been developed, where the space-time reduced order model shows an order of
a hundred speed-up with a relative error of less than 0.1% for small academic
problems. However, in order for the method to be applicable to a large-scale
problem, an efficient space-time reduced basis construction algorithm needs to
be developed. We present incremental space-time reduced basis construction
algorithm. The incremental algorithm is fully parallel and scalable.
Additionally, the block structure in the space-time reduced basis is exploited,
which enables the avoidance of constructing the reduced space-time basis. These
novel techniques are applied to a large-scale particle transport simulation
with million and billion degrees of freedom. The numerical example shows that
the algorithm is scalable and practical. Also, it achieves a tremendous
speed-up, maintaining a good accuracy. Finally, error bounds for space-only and

investigated the cation chemistry responsible for an efficient organic growth
that we observe in Titan's upper atmosphere, simulated using the PAMPRE plasma
reactor. Cation precursors were measured by in situ ion mass spectrometry in a
cold plasma and compared with INMS observations taken during the T40 flyby. A
series of positive ion measurements were performed in three CH$_4$ mixing
ratios (1%, 5% and 10%) showing a variability in ion population. Low CH$_4$
concentrations result in an abundance of amine cations such as NH$_4^+$ whereas
aliphatic compounds dominate at higher methane concentrations. In conditions of
favored tholin production, the presence of C2 compounds such as HCNH$^+$ and
C$_2$H$_5^+$ is found to be consistent with copolymeric growth structures seen
in tholin material. The observed abundance of these two ions particularly in
conditions with lower CH$_4$ amounts is consistent with modeling work
simulating aerosol growth in Titan's ionosphere, which includes mass exchange
primarily between HCNH$^+$ and C$_2$H$_5^+$ and negatively charged particles.
These results also confirm the prevalent role of C2 cations as precursors to
molecular growth and subsequent mass transfer to the charged aerosol particles
as the CH$_4$ abundance decreases towards lower altitudes.

equations with turbulence closures still play important roles in engineering
design and analysis. However, the development of turbulence models has been
stagnant for decades. With recent advances in machine learning, data-driven
turbulence models have become attractive alternatives worth further
explorations. However, a major obstacle in the development of data-driven
turbulence models is the lack of training data. In this work, we survey
currently available public turbulent flow databases and conclude that they are
inadequate for developing and validating data-driven models. Rather, we need
more benchmark data from systematically and continuously varied flow conditions
(e.g., Reynolds number and geometry) with maximum coverage in the parameter
space for this purpose. To this end, we perform direct numerical simulations of
flows over periodic hills with varying slopes, resulting in a family of flows
over periodic hills which ranges from incipient to mild and massive
separations. We further demonstrate the use of such a dataset by training a
machine learning model that predicts Reynolds stress anisotropy based on a set
of mean flow features. We expect the generated dataset, along with its design
methodology and the example application presented herein, will facilitate
development and comparison of future data-driven turbulence models.

frequencies important for cosmic microwave background explorations, combined
with a strong correlation with interstellar dust, drive cross-disciplinary
collaboration between interstellar medium and observational cosmology. The
apparent relationship with dust has prompted a ``spinning dust'' hypothesis.
The typical peak frequency range of the AME profile implicates spinning grains
on the order of 1 nm. This points to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
We use data from the AKARI/Infrared Camera (IRC), due to its thorough PAH-band
coverage, to compare AME from the Planck Collaboration astrophysical component
separation product with infrared dust emission in the Orionis AME-prominent
region. We look also at infrared dust emission from other mid IR and far-IR
bands. The results and discussion contained here apply to an angular scale of
approximately 1{\deg}. We find that certainly dust mass correlates with AME,
and that PAH-related emission in the AKARI/IRC 9 {\mu}m band correlates
slightly more strongly. Using hierarchical Bayesian inference and full dust
spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling we argue that AME in
{\lambda}Orionis correlates more strongly with PAH mass than with total dust
mass, lending support for a spinning PAH hypothesis within this region. We
emphasize that future efforts to understand AME should focus on individual

techniques are usually ineffective on real-world software systems while even
the most advanced program repair techniques can only fix a small ratio of

connected, we observe that in the literature their only connection is that
program repair techniques usually use off-the-shelf fault localization
techniques (e.g., Ochiai) to determine the potential candidate
statements/elements for patching. In this work, we explore their connection in
the other direction, i.e., can program repair in turn help with fault
localization? In this way,we not only open a new dimension for more powerful
fault localization, but also extend the application scope of program repair to
all possible bugs (not only the bugs that can be directly automatically
fixed).We have designed ProFL, a simplistic approach using patch-execution
results (from program repair) as the feedback information for fault
localization. The experimental results on the widely used Defects4J benchmark
show that the basic ProFL can already localize 161 of the 395 studied bugs
within Top-1, while state-of-the-art spectrum and mutation based fault

about 2.2 B ILCU. The total cost for the ILC high luminosity machine will
therefore be about 7.7 B versus FCC-ee 10.5 B. The AC power (267 MW) to operate
the ILC luminosity upgrade will also be less than the AC power for FCC-ee (300
MW). Even with a modest quality factor Q of $1 \times 10^{10}$ for SRF
cavities, the total cost of the upgrade will be 2.5 B ILCU additional over
ILC250 baseline. We expect that, if approved, ILC250 will first be built at the
baseline luminosity, operated for many years at this luminosity, and later
upgraded to the high luminosity option. A significant part (RF power and
cryo-power) of the additional cost for the luminosity upgrade overlaps with the
expected additional costs for anticipated energy upgrade paths. A second ILC
upgrade discussed in this paper will be to the higher energy Top Factory at 380
GeV. We also estimate the additional cost of this upgrade (1.5 B ILCU).

explore the optimisation of WEC arrays consisting of a three-tether buoy model

both the relative positions of buoys in farms and also the power-take-off (PTO)
parameters for each buoy. The search space for these parameters is complex and
multi-modal. Moreover, the evaluation of each parameter setting is
computationally expensive -- limiting the number of full model evaluations that
can be made. To handle this problem, we propose a new hybrid cooperative
co-evolution algorithm (HCCA). HCCA consists of a symmetric local search plus
Nelder-Mead and a cooperative co-evolution algorithm (CC) with a backtracking
strategy for optimising the positions and PTO settings of WECs, respectively.
Moreover, a new adaptive scenario is proposed for tuning grey wolf optimiser

been successfully applied to both supervised and unsupervised machine learning
tasks. These models assume that a dataset is generated according to a Boltzmann
distribution, and the goal of the training procedure is to learn the set of
parameters that most closely match the input data distribution. Training such
models is difficult due to the intractability of traditional sampling
techniques, and proposals using quantum annealers for sampling hope to mitigate
the sampling cost. However, real physical devices will inevitably be coupled to
the environment, and the strength of this coupling affects the effective
temperature of the distributions from which a quantum annealer samples. To
counteract this problem, error correction schemes that can effectively reduce
the temperature are needed if there is to be some benefit in using quantum
annealing for problems at a larger scale, where we might expect the effective
temperature of the device to not be sufficiently low. To this end, we have
applied nested quantum annealing correction (NQAC) to do unsupervised learning
with a small bars and stripes dataset, and to do supervised learning with a
coarse-grained MNIST dataset. For both datasets we demonstrate improved
training and a concomitant effective temperature reduction at higher noise
levels relative to the unencoded case. We also find better performance overall
with longer anneal times and offer an interpretation of the results based on a
comparison to simulated quantum annealing and spin vector Monte Carlo. A
counterintuitive aspect of our results is that the output distribution
generally becomes less Gibbs-like with increasing nesting level and increasing
anneal times, which shows that improved training performance can be achieved
without equilibration to the target Gibbs distribution.

microscopic forces by a single effective force determined solely by equilibrium
pair correlations is revisited based on the projectionless dynamic theory (PDT)
that avoids force projection. A hybrid-PDT is formulated that explicitly
quantifies how attractive forces induce dynamical constraints, while singular
hard core interactions are treated based on the projection approach. Both the
effects of interference between repulsive and attractive forces, and structural
changes due to attraction-induced bond formation that competes with caging, are
included. Combined with the microscopic Elastically Collective Nonlinear
Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory of activated relaxation, the resultant
approach appears to properly capture both the re-entrant dynamic crossover
behavior and the strong non-monotonic variation of the activated structural
relaxation time with attraction strength and range at very high volume
fractions. Qualitative differences with ECNLE theory-based results that adopt
the full projection approximation are identified, and testable predictions
made. The new formulation appears qualitatively consistent with multiple
experimental and simulation studies, and provides a new perspective for the
overall problem that is rooted in activated motion and interference between
repulsive and attractive forces. This is conceptually distinct from empirical
shifting or other ad hoc modifications of ideal mode coupling theory which do

constructing a source size distribution based on the M31 PHAT survey and on a

high-resolution proprioceptive sensing and rich tactile sensing. To do so, we
design features along the axial direction of the finger, which enable
high-resolution proprioceptive sensing, and incorporate a reflective ink
coating on the surface of the finger to enable rich tactile sensing. We design
a highly underactuated exoskeleton with a tendon-driven mechanism to actuate
the finger. Finally, we assemble 2 of the fingers together to form a robotic
gripper and successfully perform a bar stock classification task, which
requires both shape and tactile information. We train neural networks for
proprioception and shape (box versus cylinder) classification using data from
the embedded sensors. The proprioception CNN had over 99\% accuracy on our
testing set (all six joint angles were within 1 degree of error) and had an
average accumulative distance error of 0.77 mm during live testing, which is
better than human finger proprioception. These proposed techniques offer soft

solving the inverse problem with adjoint-based optimization, the problem can be
regularized by adding additional constraints in the cost function. However,
similar regularizations have not been used in ensemble-based methods, where the
same optimization is done implicitly through the analysis step rather than
through explicit minimization of the cost function. Ensemble-based methods, and
in particular ensemble Kalman methods, have gained popularity in practice where

finite and zero energy bandgap are investigated for graphene with a tilted
potential barrier under a bias. For validation, results from a
finite-difference based numerical approach, which is developed for calculating
transmission and reflection coefficients with a dynamically-tunable
(time-dependent bias field) barrier-potential profile, are compared with those
of both an analytical model for a static square-potential barrier and a
perturbation theory using Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. For a
biased barrier, both transmission coefficient and tunneling resistance are
computed and analyzed, indicating a full control of the peak in tunneling
resistance by bias field for a tilted barrier, gate voltage for barrier height,
and energy for incoming electrons. Moreover, a finite energy gap in graphene is
found to suppress head-on transmission as well as skew transmission with a
large transverse momentum. For a gapless graphene, on the other hand, filtering
of Dirac electrons outside of normal incidence is found and can be used for
designing electronic lenses. All these predicted attractive transport
properties are expected extremely useful for the development of novel
electronic and optical graphene-based devices.

convex loss functions, is an important optimization problem that has many
machine learning applications. NSM is generally NP-hard, and so to exactly
solve NSM is almost impossible in polynomial time. As regards the case of
quadratic objective functions, exact algorithms based on quadratic
mixed-integer programming (MIP) have been studied, but no existing exact
methods can handle more general objective functions including Huber and
logistic losses; this is unfortunate since those functions are prevalent in
practice. In this paper, we consider NSM with $\ell_2$-regularized convex
objective functions and develop an algorithm by leveraging the efficiency of
best-first search (BFS). Our BFS can compute solutions with objective errors at
most $\Delta\ge0$, where $\Delta$ is a controllable hyper-parameter that
balances the trade-off between the guarantee of objective errors and
computation cost. Experiments demonstrate that our BFS is useful for solving
moderate-size NSM instances with non-quadratic objectives and that BFS is also
faster than the MIP-based method when applied to quadratic objectives.

components, involve large degrees of freedom. However, recent measurement has
demonstrated that phenotypic changes resulting from adaptation and evolution in
response to environmental changes are effectively restricted to a
low-dimensional subspace. Thus, uncovering the origin and nature of such a
drastic dimension reduction is crucial to understanding the general
characteristics of biological adaptation and evolution. Herein, we first
formulated the dimension reduction in terms of dynamical systems theory:
considering the steady growth state of cells, the reduction is represented by
the separation of a few large singular values of the inverse Jacobian matrix
around a fixed point. We then examined this dimension reduction by numerical
evolution of cells consisting of thousands of chemicals whose concentrations
determine phenotype. As a result of the evolution, phenotypic changes due to
mutations and external perturbations were found to be mainly restricted to a
one-dimensional subspace. One singular value of the inverse Jacobian matrix at
a fixed point of concentrations was significantly larger than the others. The
major phenotypic changes due to mutations and external perturbations occur
along the corresponding left-singular vector, which leads to phenotypic
constraint, and fitness dominantly changes in the same direction. Once such
phenotypic constraint is acquired, phenotypic evolution to a novel environment
takes advantage of this restricted phenotypic direction. This results in the
convergence of phenotypic pathways across genetically different strains, as is
experimentally observed, while accelerating further evolution.

ideal, degenerate parametric oscillator, in the limit of negligible
single-photon signal loss. In the presence of the signal loss, this is no
longer true over timescales much longer than the damping time. However, for
sufficient parametric nonlinearity, a cat-state can exist as a transient state.
In this paper, we study the dynamics of the creation and decoherence of
cat-states in degenerate parametric oscillation, both with and without the
effect of a Kerr nonlinearity that applies to recent superconducting-circuit
experiments generating cat-states in microwave cavities. We determine the time
of formation and the lifetime of a cat-state in terms of three dimensionless
parameters $\lambda$, $g$ and $\chi$. These relate to the driving strength, the
parametric nonlinearity, and the Kerr nonlinearity, respectively. We find that
the Kerr nonlinearity has little effect on the threshold parametric
nonlinearity ($g>1$) required for the formation of cat-states, and does not
significantly alter the decoherence time of the cat-state, but can reduce the
time of formation. The quality of the cat-state increases with the value $g$,
and can also improved by the Kerr nonlinearity. To verify the existence and
quality of the cat-state, we consider several signatures, including
interference fringes and negativity, and show how they can be computed. We
simulate a superconducting-circuit experiment using published experimental
parameters and found good agreement with experimental results, indicating that
a nonclassical cat-like state with a small Wigner negativity is generated in
the experiment. A stronger nonlinearity would lead to a cat-state with
convincing cat-state signatures. Finally, we explore the feasibility of
creating large cat-states with a coherent amplitude of 20, corresponding to 400
photons.

structures such as BVH trees which wrap objects in a scene into bounding
volumes of decreasing sizes. Acceleration structures reduce the amount of
ray-scene intersections that a ray has to perform to find the intersecting
object. However, we observe a large amount of redundancy when rays are
traversing these acceleration structures. While modern acceleration structures
explore the spatial organization of the scene, they neglect similarities
between rays that traverse the structures and thereby cause redundant
traversals. This paper provides a limit study of a new promising technique,
Hash-Based Ray Path Prediction (HRPP), which exploits the similarity between
rays to predict leaf nodes to avoid redundant acceleration structure
traversals. Our data shows that acceleration structure traversal consumes a
significant proportion of the ray tracing rendering time regardless of the
platform or the target image quality. Our study quantifies unused ray locality
and evaluates the theoretical potential for improved ray traversal performance
for both coherent and seemingly incoherent rays. We show that HRPP is able to
skip, on average, 40% of all hit-all traversal computations.

packet is modified in the presence of $\Lambda > 0$. A notable feature is the
gravitational collapse of part of the wave packet, in the core region close to
the center of mass, accompanied by the accelerated expansion of the more
distant shell surrounding it. The order of magnitude of the distance separating
collapse from expansion matches analytical estimates of the classical
turnaround radius for a spherically symmetric body in the presence of dark

directly probe the magnetic structures in LiNiPO$_4$ up to 25T and 42T,
respectively. By combining these results with magnetometry and electric
polarization measurements under pulsed fields, the magnetic and magnetoelectric
phases are investigated up to 56T applied along the easy $c$-axis. In addition
to the already known transitions at lower fields, three new ones are reported
at 37.6, 39.4 and 54T. Ordering vectors are identified with ${\bf
Q}_{\mathrm{VI}}$ = (0, 1/3, 0) in the interval 37.6--39.4T and ${\bf
Q}_{\mathrm{VII}}$ = (0, 0, 0) in the interval 39.4-54T. A quadratic
magnetoelectric effect is discovered in the ${\bf Q}_{\mathrm{VII}}$ = (0, 0,

described using a simple mean-field model. The observed magnetic structure and
magnetoelectric tensor elements point to a change in the lattice symmetry in
this phase. We speculate on the possible physical mechanism responsible for the
magnetoelectric effect in LiNiPO4.

them are accompanied by a hysteresis, suggesting first-order transitions. The
theoretical calculation applicable to CuInCr4S8 is also shown, based on the

Jacobian DF(x) around a fully synchronous point x = (x0, ..., x0) is again an

admissible maps for homogeneous networks. In particular, we define so-called
network multipliers. These are (relatively small) matrices that depend linearly
on the coefficients of the response function, and whose eigenvalues together
make up the spectrum of the corresponding admissible map. More precisely, given
a network N, we define a finite set of network multipliers L1 to Lk and a class
of networks C containing N. This class is furthermore closed under taking
quotient networks, subnetworks and disjoint unions. We then show that the
eigenvalues of an admissible map for any network in C are given by those of (a
subset of) the network multipliers, with fixed multiplicities m1 to mk and
independently of the given (finite dimensional) phase space of a node. The
coefficients of all the network multipliers of C are furthermore linearly
independent, which implies that one may find the multiplicities m1 to mk by
simply expressing the trace of an admissible map as a linear combination of the
traces of the multipliers. In particular, we will give examples of networks

looking at small networks in C. We also show that network multipliers are

objects---abstracted as the group of isometries of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ denoted by

world. In this paper, we compute various isometric invariances which
mathematically are orbit-computation problems under various isometry-subgroup
actions $H \curvearrowright \mathbb{Z}^n, H \leq \mathsf{ISO}(\mathbb{Z}^n)$.
One computational challenge here is about the \emph{infinite}: in general, we
can have an infinite subgroup acting on $\mathbb{Z}^n$, resulting in possibly
an infinite number of orbits of possibly infinite size. In practice, we
restrict the set of orbits (a partition of $\mathbb{Z}^n$) to a finite subset
$Z \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^n$ (a partition of $Z$), where $Z$ is specified a
priori by an application domain or a data set. Our main contribution is an
efficient algorithm to solve this \emph{restricted} orbit-computation problem
in the special case of \emph{atomically generated subgroups}---a new notion
partially motivated from interpretable AI. The atomic property is key to
preserving the \emph{semidirect-product structure}---the core structure we
leverage to make our algorithm outperform generic approaches. Besides
algorithmic merit, our approach enables \emph{parallel-computing}
implementations in many subroutines, which can further benefit from hardware
boosts. Moreover, our algorithm works efficiently for \emph{any} finite subset

surface-polaritonic waveguide reconfiguration that enables excitation,
propagation and coherent control of coupled dark rogue waves having orthogonal
polarizations. Our control mechanism is achieved by finely tuning laser-field
intensities and their respective detuning at the interface between the atomic

electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) windows commensurate with
surface-polaritonic polarization-modulation instability to create symmetric and
asymmetric polaritonic frequency combs associated with dark localized waves.
Our method takes advantage of an atomic self-defocusing nonlinearity and dark
rogue-wave propagation to obtain a sufficient condition for generating phase
singularities. Underpinning this method is our theory which incorporates
dissipation and dispersion due to the atomic medium being coupled to nonlinear
surface-polaritonic waves~(SPWs). Consequently, our waveguide configuration
acts as a bimodal polaritonic frequency-comb generator and a high-speed phase
rotator, thereby opening prospects for phase singularities in nanophotonic and
quantum communication devices.

Updates, is the main dynamic in evolutionary game theory. In simple
evolutionary zero-sum games, such as Rock-Paper-Scissors, replicator dynamic is
periodic \cite{zeeman1980population}, however, its behavior in higher
dimensions is not well understood. We provide a complete characterization of
its behavior in zero-sum evolutionary games. We prove that, if and only if, the
system has an interior Nash equilibrium, the dynamics exhibit Poincar\'{e}
recurrence, i.e., almost all orbits come arbitrary close to their initial
conditions infinitely often. If no interior equilibria exist, then all interior
initial conditions converge to the boundary. Specifically, the strategies that
are not in the support of any equilibrium vanish in the limit of all orbits.
All recurrence results furthermore extend to a class of games that generalize
both graphical polymatrix games as well as evolutionary games, establishing a
unifying link between evolutionary and algorithmic game theory. We show that
two degrees of freedom, as in Rock-Paper-Scissors, is sufficient to prove
periodicity.

  Conversations","To appear in ASRU2019",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the lack of publicly available resources, conversation summarization
has received far less attention than text summarization. As the purpose of
conversations is to exchange information between at least two interlocutors,
key information about a certain topic is often scattered and spanned across
multiple utterances and turns from different speakers. This phenomenon is more
pronounced during spoken conversations, where speech characteristics such as
backchanneling and false-starts might interrupt the topical flow. Moreover,
topic diffusion and (intra-utterance) topic drift are also more common in
human-to-human conversations. Such linguistic characteristics of dialogue
topics make sentence-level extractive summarization approaches used in spoken
documents ill-suited for summarizing conversations. Pointer-generator networks
have effectively demonstrated its strength at integrating extractive and
abstractive capabilities through neural modeling in text summarization. To the
best of our knowledge, to date no one has adopted it for summarizing
conversations. In this work, we propose a topic-aware architecture to exploit
the inherent hierarchical structure in conversations to further adapt the
pointer-generator model. Our approach significantly outperforms competitive
baselines, achieves more efficient learning outcomes, and attains more robust
performance.

two binary operations (addition and composition) on the space RxL2. These
operators frequently appear in analysis and control of infinite-dimensional
systems such as Partial Differential equations (PDE) and Time-delay systems
(TDS). Furthermore, PIETOOLS can: declare opvar decision variables, add
operator positivity constraints, declare an objective function, and solve the
resulting optimization problem using a syntax similar to the sdpvar class in
YALMIP. Use of the resulting Linear Operator Inequalities (LOIs) are
demonstrated on several examples, including stability analysis of a PDE,
bounding operator norms, and verifying integral inequalities. The result is
that PIETOOLS, packaged with SOSTOOLS and MULTIPOLY, offers a scalable,
user-friendly and computationally efficient toolbox for parsing, performing
algebraic operations, setting up and solving convex optimization problems on PI

polarized degenerate Fermi gas (DFG), fermions can mediate spin-spin
interactions between bosons, leading to an effective long-range magnetic
interaction analogous to Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in
solids. We used Ramsey spectroscopy of the hyperfine clock transition in a
$^{87}$Rb BEC to measure the interaction mediated by a $^{40}$K DFG. By
controlling the bosons density we isolated the effect of mediated interactions
from mean-field frequency shifts due to direct collision with fermions. We
measured an increase of boson spin-spin interaction by a factor of
$\eta=1.45\pm 0.05^{stat} \pm 0.13^{sys}$ in the presence of the DFG, providing
a clear evidence of spin-spin fermion mediated interaction. Decoherence in our

significantly in the presence of the DFG, again indicating mediated
interactions. We also measured a frequency shift due to boson-fermion
interactions in accordance with a scattering length difference of
$a_{bf_2}-a_{bf_1}=-5.36 \pm 0.44^{stat} \pm 1.43^{sys}~a_0$ between the

This is done in the context of a perturbed flat cosmology that, in addition, is
minimally coupled to fermionic perturbations. In our description, we use a
canonical formulation for the entire system, formed by the underlying
cosmological spacetime and all its perturbations. After introducing an
adiabatic scheme that was originally developed in the context of quantum field
theory in fixed cosmological backgrounds, we find that all adiabatic states
belong to the unitary equivalence class of Fock representations that allow a
unitarily implementable quantum evolution. In particular, this unitarity of the
dynamics ensures that the vacua defined with adiabatic initial conditions at
different times are unitarily equivalent. We also find that, for all adiabatic
orders other than zero, these initial conditions allow the definition of
annihilation and creation operators for the Dirac field that lead to some
finite backreaction in the quantum Hamiltonian constraint and to a fermionic
Hamiltonian operator that is properly defined in the span of the

by interfacing with HPC libraries for large-scale distributed computations. In
this paper, we highlight some recent developments in Alchemist that are of
interest to Cray users and the scientific community in general. We discuss our
experience porting Alchemist to container images and deploying it on Cray XC
(using Shifter) and CS (using Singularity) series supercomputers and on a local
Kubernetes cluster.
  Newly developed interfaces for Python, Dask, and PySpark enable the use of
Alchemist with additional data analysis frameworks. We also briefly discuss the
combination of Alchemist with RLlib, an increasingly popular library for
reinforcement learning, and consider the benefits of leveraging HPC simulations
in reinforcement learning. Finally, since data transfer between the client
applications and Alchemist are the main overhead Alchemist encounters, we give
a qualitative assessment of these transfer times with respect to
different~factors.

approach to driving a vast number of end devices with artificial intelligence.
However, it is very challenging to guarantee the efficiency of FL considering
the unreliable nature of end devices while the cost of device-server
communication cannot be neglected. In this paper, we propose SAFA, a
semi-asynchronous FL protocol, to address the problems in federated learning
such as low round efficiency and poor convergence rate in extreme conditions
(e.g., clients dropping offline frequently). We introduce novel designs in the
steps of model distribution, client selection and global aggregation to
mitigate the impacts of stragglers, crashes and model staleness in order to
boost efficiency and improve the quality of the global model. We have conducted
extensive experiments with typical machine learning tasks. The results
demonstrate that the proposed protocol is effective in terms of shortening
federated round duration, reducing local resource wastage, and improving the
accuracy of the global model at an acceptable communication cost.

that induces a forest. We prove the following.
  1. Let $G$ be a graph of order $n$, maximum degree $\Delta>0$ and maximum
clique size $\omega$. Then \[ a(G) \geq \frac{6n}{2\Delta + \omega +2}. \] This
bound is sharp for cliques.
  2. Let $G=(V,E)$ be a triangle-free graph and let $d(v)$ denote the degree of
$v \in V$. Then \[ a(G) \geq \sum_{v \in V} \min\left(1, \frac{3}{d(v)+2}

  As a corollary we have that a triangle-free graph $G$ of order $n$, with $m$
edges and average degree $d \geq 2$ satisfies \[ a(G) \geq \frac{3n}{d+2}. \]
This improves the lower bound $n - \frac{m}{4}$ of Alon-Mubayi-Thomas for
graphs of average degree greater than $4$. Furthermore it improves the lower
bound $\frac{20n - 5m - 5}{19}$ of Shi-Xu for (connected) graphs of average

polynomial time does not works for identifying the tractable problems in big
data computing. This paper adopts the sublinear time as the new tractable
standard to recognize the tractability in big data computing, and the
random-access Turing machine is used as the computational model to characterize
the problems that are tractable on big data. First, two pure-tractable classes
are first proposed. One is the class $\mathrm{PL}$ consisting of the problems
that can be solved in polylogarithmic time by a RATM. The another one is the
class $\mathrm{ST}$ including all the problems that can be solved in sublinear
time by a RATM. The structure of the two pure-tractable classes is deeply
investigated and they are proved $\mathrm{PL^i} \subsetneq \mathrm{PL^{i+1}}$
and $\mathrm{PL} \subsetneq \mathrm{ST}$. Then, two pseudo-tractable classes,
$\mathrm{PTR}$ and $\mathrm{PTE}$, are proposed. $\mathrm{PTR}$ consists of all
the problems that can solved by a RATM in sublinear time after a PTIME
preprocessing by reducing the size of input dataset. $\mathrm{PTE}$ includes
all the problems that can solved by a RATM in sublinear time after a PTIME

they are proved that $\mathrm{PT} \subseteq \mathrm{P}$, $\sqcap'\mathrm{T^0_Q}

from the Sydney AAO Multi-object Integral Field (SAMI) Galaxy Survey with
stellar kinematics out to $\geq1.5R_\text{e}$. We advocate for a
morpho-dynamical classification of galaxies, relying on spatially-resolved
photometric and kinematic data. We find the use of spin-ellipticity radial
tracks is valuable in identifying substructures within a galaxy, including
embedded and counter-rotating discs, that are easily missed in unilateral
studies of the photometry alone. Conversely, bars are rarely apparent in the
stellar kinematics but are readily identified on images. Consequently, we
distinguish the spin-ellipticity radial tracks of seven morpho-dynamical types:
elliptical, lenticular, early spiral, late spiral, barred spiral, embedded
disc, and 2-sigma galaxies. The importance of probing beyond the inner radii of
galaxies is highlighted by the characteristics of galactic features in the
spin-ellipticity radial tracks present at larger radii. The density of
information presented through spin-ellipticity radial tracks emphasises a clear
advantage to representing galaxies as a track, rather than a single point, in
spin-ellipticity parameter space.

on the number of lattice points lying in small balls on the surface of the

we show that for a density $1$ subsequence of squarefree integers, the variance
exhibits a different asymptotic behaviour for balls of volume $(\log

  We also obtain analogous results for Heegner points and closed geodesics.
Interestingly, we are able to prove some slightly stronger results for closed

paper we describe flare-associated emissions via a statistical study of 477 M-

Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, which has been monitoring
the full-disk solar \lya\ irradiance on 10~s timescales over the course of
Solar Cycle 24. The vast majority (95\%) of these flares produced \lya\
enhancements of 10\% or less above background levels, with a maximum increase
of $\sim$30\%. The irradiance in \lya\ was found to exceed that of the 1-8 \AA\
X-ray irradiance by as much as two orders of magnitude in some cases, although
flares that occurred closer to the solar limb were found to exhibit less of a
\lya\ enhancement. This center-to-limb variation was verified through a joint,
stereoscopic observation of an X-class flare that appeared near the limb as
viewed from Earth, but close to disk center as viewed by the MAVEN spacecraft
in orbit around Mars. The frequency distribution of peak \lya\ was found to
have a power-law slope of $2.8\pm0.27$. We also show that increased \lya\ flux
is closely correlated with induced currents in the ionospheric E-layer through
the detection of the solar flare effect as observed by the Kakioka

origin of the extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars, likely formed from the ejecta
of one or a few previous massive stars. We investigate the rotational
properties of early massive stars by comparing the abundance patterns of EMP
stars with rotating massive stellar models. Low metallicity 20 $M_{\odot}$
stellar models with initial rotation rates between 0 and $70~\%$ of the
critical velocity are computed. Explosions with strong fallback are assumed.
The ejected material is considered to fit individually the abundance patterns
of 272 EMP stars with $-4<$ [Fe/H] $<-3$. With increasing initial rotation, the
[C/H], [N/H], [O/H], [Na/H], [Mg/H] and [Al/H] ratios in the massive star
ejecta are gradually increased. Among the 272 EMP stars considered, $\sim
40-50~\%$ are consistent with our models. About $60 - 70~\%$ of the CEMP star
sample is reproduced against $\sim 20 - 30~\%$ for the C-normal EMP star
sample. The CEMP stars are preferentially reproduced with a material coming
from mid to fast rotating massive stars. The velocity distribution derived from
the best massive star models increases from no rotation to fast rotation. The
maximum is reached for massive stars having initial equatorial velocities of
$\sim 550 - 640$ km~s$^{-1}$. Although subject to significant uncertainties,
these results suggest that the rotational mixing operating in between the
H-burning shell and the He-burning core of early massive stars played an
important role in the early chemical enrichment of the Universe. The comparison
of the velocity distribution derived from the best massive star models with
velocity distributions of nearby OB stars suggests a greater amount of massive
fast rotators in the early Universe. This may have important consequences for
reionization or integrated light from high redshift galaxies.

range of 510 to 590nm. The K+F continuum corona is well exposed up to 2 solar
radius. The F-corona can be measured even at the solar limb. New weak emission
lines were discovered or confirmed. The rarely observed high FIP ArX line is
recorded almost everywhere; the FeXIV and NiXIII lines are well recorded
everywhere. For the first time hot lines are also measured inside the CH
regions. The radial variations of the non-thermal turbulent velocities of the
lines do not show a great departure from the average values. No significantly
large Doppler shifts are seen anywhere in the inner and the middle corona. The
wings of the FeXIV line show some non-Gaussianity.

X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in having powerful radio and $\gamma$-ray emitting jets
in its soft spectral state. However, the transition from the hard state to the
soft one is first associated with quenching of the hard-state radio emission,
as in LMXBs. The powerful soft-state jets in Cyg X-3 form, on average, $\sim$50
d later. We interpret the initial jet quenching as due to the hard-state
vertical magnetic field quickly diffusing away in the thin disc extending to
the innermost stable circular orbit in the soft state, or, if that field is
produced in situ, also cessation of its generation. The subsequent formation of
the powerful jets occurs due to advection of the magnetic field from the donor.
We find this happens only above certain threshold accretion rate associated
with appearance of magnetically driven outflows. The $\sim$50 d lag is of the
order of the viscous timescale in the outer disc, while the field advection is
much faster. This process does not happen in LMXBs due to the magnetic fluxes
available from their donors being lower than that for the wind accretion from
the Wolf-Rayet donor of Cyg X-3. In our model, the vertical magnetic field in
the hard state, required to form the jets both in Cyg X-3 and LMXBs, is formed
in situ rather than advected from the donor. Our results provide a unified
scenario of the soft and hard states in both Cyg X-3 and LMXBs.

increase of data rate requirements and user densities will soon require the
exploration of next-generation technologies. Among these, Terahertz (THz) band
communication seems to be a promising direction due to availability of large
bandwidth in the electromagnetic spectrum in this frequency range, and the
ability to exploit its directional nature by directive antennas with small form
factors. The first step in the analysis of any communication system is the
analysis of the propagation channel, since it determines the fundamental
limitations it faces. While THz channels have been explored for indoor,
short-distance communications, the channels for {\em wireless access links in
outdoor environments} are largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the -
to our knowledge - first set of double-directional outdoor propagation channel
measurements for the THz band. Specifically, the measurements are done in the
141 - 148.5 GHz range, which is one of the frequency bands recently allocated
for THz research by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC). We employ
double directional channel sounding using a frequency domain sounding setup
based on RF-over-Fiber (RFoF) extensions for measurements over 100 m distance
in urban scenarios. An important result is the surprisingly large number of
directions (i.e., direction-of-arrival and direction-of-departure pairs) that
carry significant energy. More generally, our results suggest fundamental
parameters that can be used in future THz Band analysis and implementations.

radiation beam arrives at the detector surface at tilted angle. The image
blurring occurs as the radiation penetrates detector material in lateral
direction at tilted angle. However, at the photon energies used in x-ray
microscopy the attenuation length of the x-rays in the detector material is
shorter and consequently the parallax error due to the tilted angle irradiation
can be smaller. In these cases, the tilted angle irradiation can be beneficial
because it will expand the beam projection (""footprint"") at the detector
surface, improve spatial resolution and help to overcome inherent resolution
limit of the detector. We have performed a simulation study to investigate the
above trade-off between the parallax error and improved spatial resolution when
tilted angle irradiation is used. Our simulation study showed that tilted angle
irradiation at 2-5keV x-ray energies can provide substantial improvements of
spatial resolution. We used in our studies the indirect-conversion x-ray
microscopy detectors based on scintillators optically coupled to CCD and CMOS
cameras, as well as direct-conversion detectors based on back illuminated (back

constraints on summary statistics. Such a procedure results in a discrete
probability distribution that maximises the likelihood among all such
distributions under the specified constraints (called estimating equations),
and is an approximation to the underlying population distribution. The study of
such empirical likelihood originates from the seminal work of Owen. We
investigate this procedure in the setting of mis-specified (or biased)
estimating equations, i.e. when the null hypothesis is not true. We establish
that the behaviour of the optimal distribution under such mis-specification
differ markedly from their properties under the null, i.e. when the estimating
equations are unbiased and correctly specified. This is manifested by certain
degeneracies in the optimal distribution which define the likelihood. Such
degeneracies are not observed under the null. Furthermore, we establish an
anomalous behaviour of the log-likelihood based Wilks statistic, which, unlike
under the null, does not exhibit a chi-squared limit. In the Bayesian setting,
we rigorously establish the posterior consistency of procedures based on these
ideas, where instead of a parametric likelihood, an empirical likelihood is
used to define the posterior distribution. In particular, we show that this
posterior, as a random probability measure, rapidly converges to the delta
measure at the true parameter value. A novel feature of our approach is the
investigation of critical points of random functions in the context of such
empirical likelihood. In particular, we obtain the location and the mass of the
degenerate optimal weights as the leading and sub-leading terms in a canonical
expansion of a particular critical point of a random function that is naturally
associated with the model.

Aggregations and Fuzzy Logic. In this paper the class of group-like uninorms is
introduced and characterized. First, two variants of a general construction --
called partial-lexicographic product -- will be recalled from
\cite{Jenei_Hahn}; these construct odd involutive FL$_e$-algebras. Then two
particular ways of applying the partial-lexicographic product construction will
be specified. The first method constructs, starting from $\mathbb R$ (the
additive group of the reals) and modifying it in some way by $\mathbb Z$'s (the
additive group of the integers), what we call basic group-like uninorms,
whereas with the second method one can modify any group-like uninorm by a basic
group-like uninorm to obtain another group-like uninorm. All group-like
uninorms obtained this way have finitely many idempotent elements. On the other
hand, we prove that given any group-like uninorm which has finitely many
idempotent elements, it can be constructed by consecutive applications of the
second construction (finitely many times) using only basic group-like uninorms
as building blocks. Hence any basic group-like uninorm can be built using the
first method, and any group-like uninorm which has finitely many idempotent
elements can be built using the second method from only basic group-like
uninorms. In this way a complete characterization for group-like uninorms which
possess finitely many idempotent elements is given: ultimately, all such
uninorms can be built from $\mathbb R$ and $\mathbb Z$. This characterization
provides, for potential applications in several fields of fuzzy theory or
aggregation theory, the whole spectrum of choice of those group-like uninorms
which possess finitely many idempotent elements.

adopt achiral Bloch configurations at rest. Such domain walls can be driven by
either out-of-plane fields or spin transfer torques upon bulk current
injection. Our results indicate that the domain wall velocity is optimized at
the angular compensation temperature for both field-driven and current-driven

applications of ordinal networks have been mainly focused on time series
arising from nonlinear dynamical systems, while basic properties of ordinal
networks related to simple stochastic processes remain poorly understood. Here,
we investigate several properties of ordinal networks emerging from random time
series, noisy periodic signals, fractional Brownian motion, and earthquake
magnitude series. For ordinal networks of random series, we present an approach
for building the exact form of the adjacency matrix, which in turn is useful
for detecting non-random behavior in time series and the existence of missing
transitions among ordinal patterns. We find that the average value of a local
entropy, estimated from transition probabilities among neighboring nodes of
ordinal networks, is more robust against noise addition than the standard
permutation entropy. We show that ordinal networks can be used for estimating
the Hurst exponent of time series with accuracy comparable with
state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we argue that ordinal networks can detect
sudden changes in Earth seismic activity caused by large earthquakes.

problem for unsupervised domain adaptation. Recent studies reveal that a deep
neural network can learn transferable features which generalize well to novel
tasks. Furthermore, a theory proposed by Ben-David et al. (2010) provides a
upper bound for target error when transferring the knowledge, which can be
summarized as minimizing the source error and distance between marginal
distributions simultaneously. However, common methods based on the theory
usually ignore the joint error such that samples from different classes might
be mixed together when matching marginal distribution. And in such case, no
matter how we minimize the marginal discrepancy, the target error is not
bounded due to an increasing joint error. To address this problem, we propose a
general upper bound taking joint error into account, such that the undesirable
case can be properly penalized. In addition, we utilize constrained hypothesis
space to further formalize a tighter bound as well as a novel cross margin
discrepancy to measure the dissimilarity between hypotheses which alleviates
instability during adversarial learning. Extensive empirical evidence shows
that our proposal outperforms related approaches in image classification error
rates on standard domain adaptation benchmarks.

tensor perturbations. These leave an imprint into the temperature and
polarisation anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The
differential equation describing the primordial tensor perturbations is a
second order differential equation and thus has two solutions. Canonically, the
decaying solution of this equation in radiation domination is dropped as it
diverges at early times and on superhorizon scales while it is then suppressed
at late times. Furthermore, if there is an inflationary phase prior to the
radiation domination phase, the amplitude of the decaying mode will also be
highly suppressed as it enters the radiation phase, thus its effect will be
negligible. In this study we remain agnostic to the early universe models
describing pre-radiation domination physics and allow this mode to be present
and see what effect it has on the CMB anisotropies. We find that the decaying
mode, if normalised at the same time on subhorizon scales as the growing mode
leaves an imprint on the CMB anisotropies that is identical to the growing
mode. Contrary to expectation, on large scales both modes are poorly
constrained for a scale invariant spectrum, and the apparent divergence of the
decaying mode does not lead to a divergent physical observable. Quantitatively,
the decaying mode can be more constrained both from temperature and
polarisation anisotropies. We use a model independent, non-parametric, approach
to constrain both of these primordial tensor perturbations using the
temperature and polarisation anisotropies. We find that both modes are best
constrained at the reionisation and recombination bumps and crucially, at the
reionisation bump the decaying mode can be distinguished from the growing mode.

Fusion of the networks is also examined for boosting the obtained performance,
at Decision-, or at Model-level; in the latter case a RNN was used for the
fusion. Our approach, although using only the visual modality, outperformed
state-of-the-art methods that utilized audio and visual modalities. Some of our

several conformational and dynamic observables on the shear rate and the
concentration, obtaining a set of power-law scaling laws. The concentration has
a very different effect on the shear rate dependence of the former observables
in SCNPs than in simple linear chains. Whereas for the latter the scaling
behavior is marginally dependent on the concentration, two clearly different
scaling regimes are found for the SCNPs below and above the overlap
concentration. At fixed shear rate SCNPs and linear chains also respond very
differently to crowding. Whereas, at moderate and high Weissenberg numbers the
linear chains swell, the SCNPs exhibit a complex non-monotonic behavior. These
findings are inherently related to the topological interactions preventing
concatenation of the SCNP loops, leading to less interpenetration than for

super-resolution (LFSR) as tensor restoration and develop a learning framework
based on a two-stage restoration with 4-dimensional (4D) convolution. This
allows our model to learn the features capturing the geometry information
encoded in multiple adjacent views. Such geometric features vary near the
occlusion regions and indicate the foreground object border. To train a
feasible network, we propose a novel normalization operation based on a group
of views in the feature maps, design a stage-wise loss function, and develop
the multi-range training strategy to further improve the performance.
Evaluations are conducted on a number of light field datasets including
real-world scenes, synthetic data, and microscope light fields. The proposed

technology for making accelerator neutrino measurements, due to their high
material density, precise tracking, and calorimetric capabilities. An electric
field (E-field) is required in such detectors to drift ionized electrons to the
anode to be collected. The E-field of a TPC is often approximated to be uniform
between the anode and the cathode planes. However, significant distortions can
appear from effects such as mechanical deformations, electrode failures, or the
accumulation of space charge generated by cosmic rays. The latter is
particularly relevant for detectors placed near the Earth's surface and with
large drift distances and long drift time. To determine the E-field in situ, an
ultraviolet (UV) laser system is installed in the MicroBooNE experiment at
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The purpose of this system is to provide
precise measurements of the E-field, and to make it possible to correct for 3D
spatial distortions due to E-field non-uniformities. Here we describe the

evolution of neutron stars. In particular, the threshold of the direct Urca
process, which is one of the fast cooling processes, is determined by the
interior proton fraction $Y_p$, or the nuclear symmetry energy. Since recent
observations indicate the small radius of neutron stars, a low value is
preferred for the symmetry energy. In this study, simulations of neutron star
cooling are performed adopting three models for equation of state (EoS):
Togashi, Shen, and LS220 EoSs. The Togashi EoS has been recently constructed
with realistic nuclear potentials under finite temperature, and found to
account for the small radius of neutron stars. As a result, we find that, since
the direct Urca process is forbidden, the neutron star cooling is slow with use
of the Togashi EoS. This is because symmetry energy of Togashi EoS is lower
than those of other EoSs. Hence, in order to account for observed age and
surface temperature of isolated neutron stars (INS) with use of the Togashi
EoS, other fast cooling processes are needed regardless of the surface
composition.

transparency on machine learning decisions. The concept is simple: like humans,

fairness can be assessed. While this approach is promising in a local context

reasoning cannot simply be transposed in a remote context, where a trained
model by a service provider is only accessible through its API. This is
problematic as it constitutes precisely the target use-case requiring
transparency from a societal perspective. Through an analogy with a club
bouncer (which may provide untruthful explanations upon customer reject), we
show that providing explanations cannot prevent a remote service from lying
about the true reasons leading to its decisions. More precisely, we prove the
impossibility of remote explainability for single explanations, by constructing
an attack on explanations that hides discriminatory features to the querying
user. We provide an example implementation of this attack. We then show that
the probability that an observer spots the attack, using several explanations
for attempting to find incoherences, is low in practical settings. This
undermines the very concept of remote explainability in general.

the core of human intelligence. Most video reasoning benchmarks, however, focus

To this end, we introduce the CoLlision Events for Video REpresentation and
Reasoning (CLEVRER), a diagnostic video dataset for systematic evaluation of
computational models on a wide range of reasoning tasks. Motivated by the
theory of human casual judgment, CLEVRER includes four types of questions:
descriptive (e.g., ""what color""), explanatory (""what is responsible for""),
predictive (""what will happen next""), and counterfactual (""what if""). We
evaluate various state-of-the-art models for visual reasoning on our benchmark.
While these models thrive on the perception-based task (descriptive), they
perform poorly on the causal tasks (explanatory, predictive and
counterfactual), suggesting that a principled approach for causal reasoning
should incorporate the capability of both perceiving complex visual and
language inputs, and understanding the underlying dynamics and causal
relations. We also study an oracle model that explicitly combines these
components via symbolic representations.

attention from the media, the financial industry and academia. With the
increase in popularity, malicious users found new opportunities to profit by
deceiving newcomers. Consequently, attackers started luring other attackers
into contracts that seem to have exploitable flaws, but that actually contain a
complex hidden trap that in the end benefits the contract creator. In the
blockchain community, these contracts are known as honeypots. A recent study
presented a tool called HONEYBADGER that uses symbolic execution to detect
honeypots by analyzing contract bytecode. In this paper, we present a data
science detection approach based foremost on the contract transaction behavior.
We create a partition of all the possible cases of fund movements between the
contract creator, the contract, the transaction sender and other participants.
To this end, we add transaction aggregated features, such as the number of
transactions and the corresponding mean value and other contract features, for
example compilation information and source code length. We find that all
aforementioned categories of features contain useful information for the
detection of honeypots. Moreover, our approach allows us to detect new,
previously undetected honeypots of already known techniques. We furthermore
employ our method to test the detection of unknown honeypot techniques by
sequentially removing one technique from the training set. We show that our
method is capable of discovering the removed honeypot techniques. Finally, we
discovered two new techniques that were previously not known.

semimetal and excitonic insulator. Near this quantum critical point, the
fermion velocities are considerably reduced by excitonic quantum fluctuation,
leading to fermion mass enhancement. The quasiparticle residue is suppressed as
the energy decreases but is finite at zero energy. This indicates that ZrSiS is
a strongly correlated Fermi liquid, and explains why the mass enhancement is

$\tilde{g}\rightarrow \bar{t}t\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}$, where $\tilde{t}_{1}t$
represents both $\tilde{t}_{1}\bar{t}$ and $\tilde{t}_{1}^{*}t$. The region
with $m_{\tilde{g}} \lesssim 2$ TeV is excluded up to $68\%$ CL in the CMSSM if
the gluino decays into a stop and top quark, while the $95\%$ CL exclusion
requires $m_{\tilde{g}}\gtrsim 1.9$ TeV. Such exclusion bounds on the gluino
mass more or less overlap with the current LHC results. The decay mode
$\tilde{g}\rightarrow \bar{t}t\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}$ may take over if
$\tilde{g}\rightarrow \tilde{t}_{1}t$ is not allowed. One can probe the gluino
mass in this case up to about 1.5 TeV with $68\%$ CL in the CMSSM, and about
1.4 TeV with $95\%$ CL. A similar analyses in the NUGM framework yield
exclusion curves for the gluino mass $m_{\tilde{g}}\gtrsim 2.1$ TeV at 14 TeV
for both decay modes of the gluino under consideration. We also show that
increasing the center of mass energy to 27 TeV can probe the gluino mass up to
about 3 TeV through its decay mode into stop and top quark. The Dark Matter
constraints are not very severe in the framework of NUGM, and they allow
solutions with $m_{\tilde{g}},m_{\tilde{t}} \gtrsim 1$ TeV. In addition, with
NUGM the LSP neutralino can coannihilate with gluino and/or stop for
$m_{\tilde{g}},m_{\tilde{t}}\approx m_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}} \in [0.9-1.5]$

scale and locality from the 3D neighborhood. Standard convolutions are local in
the image space ($u, v$), often with a fixed receptive field of 3x3 pixels. We
propose to define convolutions local with respect to the corresponding point in
the 3D real-world space ($x, y, z$), where the depth channel is used to adapt
the receptive field of the convolution, which yields the resulting filters
invariant to scale and focusing on the certain range of depth. We introduce 3D
Neighborhood Convolution (3DN-Conv), a convolutional operator around 3D
neighborhoods. Further, we can use estimated depth to use our RGB-D based
semantic segmentation model from RGB input. Experimental results validate that
our proposed 3DN-Conv operator improves semantic segmentation, using either
ground-truth depth (RGB-D) or estimated depth (RGB).

of the paper considers both steady-state as well as transient information for
the assessment of control-loop interactions. The RNGA for square systems is
extended for non-square multivariable systems by thoroughly deriving its
supporting properties. The RNGA method is applied to a non-square multivariable
radiator laboratory test setup for loop pairing. Closed-loop results arising
from the RNGA-based loop pairing are depicted in the paper. The lacuna of the

provide test sources for ARA receiver stations sensitive to vertical and
horizontal polarizations. For these tests, signal geometries correspond to
obliquely propagating radio waves from below. The ARA collaboration has
recently measured the polarization-dependent time delay variation, and report
more significant time delays for trajectories perpendicular to ice flow. Here
we use fabric data from the SPICE ice core to construct a bounding model for
the ice birefringence and the polarization time delays across ARA. The
data-model comparison is consistent with the vertical girdle fabric at the
South Pole having the prevailing horizontal crystallographic axis oriented

introduced to improve the reconstruction quality. The second factor is the
illumination pattern. A better illumination pattern ensures the quantity and
quality of the information content of the data set thus leading to better

another inverse problem with the illumination pattern as unknown. Both inverse
problems of reconstructing the fluorescence distribution and finding the

Numerical experiments have shown that with a suitable choice of the

subsequently undergo hierarchical self-assembly into nematic fluids. Inspired
by recent modelling efforts on chromonic liquid crystals, composed of discotic
building blocks, we formulate a second-virial theory for reversible
supramolecular rods. Unlike chromonics, these systems are capable of forming
stable nematic phases in the high-temperature, monomeric limit in the absence
of polymerization. Changing the tip potential from attractive to repulsive thus
enables a smooth crossover from a monomeric to a polymeric nematic fluid. We
analyze the isotropic-nematic phase behavior for both regimes and address the
nematic elastic properties. The theory accounts for the molecular flexibility
and chirality of the filaments and respects the intrinsic chain-length
dependence of nematic order. We also discuss the impact of polymerization
inhibitors on the phase behavior in the polymeric regime and find that the
inhibitors cause a marked narrowing of the isotropic-nematic biphasic region,
and generate reentrance nematization as well as a mass density inversion of the
coexisting phases. We finally discuss the elastic moduli of rod-based polymeric
nematics by qualitative comparing their elastic anisotropies with those of
chromonic liquid crystals and other nanoparticle-based nematics.

LSD-method, namely its requirement for weak magnetic fields, weak spectral
lines, the same shape of polarized profiles. Also, this method is free from
model limitations of the PCA, NDD and ZCD methods also. The SL-method involves
the calculation of the magnetic field using individual spectral lines and the
subsequent formation of uniform arrays of the magnetic field measurements. The
formation of the arrays is based on different criteria, e.g. using spectral
lines of a chemical element, assumption of the same physical conditions in the
areas of the spectral line formation, a statistically significant difference
between the values of the magnetic field calculated from different arrays of
spectral lines etc. If there are several arrays of spectral lines, it is
necessary to obtain normalized polarized profiles using predetermined
parameters for each array: the magnitude of the field, wavelength for
normalization, Lande factor and the central residual intensity of the line. In
this paper, we present a method of normalization of polarized profiles based on
the dependence of the residual intensity of the observed polarized profiles on
their central residual intensity (COntour Algorithm of the Line Approximation:
COALA). The SL and COALA methods strong depend on the signal-to-noise ratio and
a number of used unblended spectral lines. In this work the application of the

inclinations and an asymmetry in number of bodies between the two swarms.
Different models have been proposed to explain the high inclination of the
Trojans and to interpret their relation with the TNOs, but none of them can
also satisfactorily explain the asymmetry ratio. Recently it has been found
that the asymmetry can arise if Jupiter has migrated inwards by at least a few
au during its growth. The asymmetry and the dark colors of the Trojans are
natural outcomes of this model, but simulations with massless unperturbed disc
particles led to a flat distribution of the Trojan inclinations and a final
total mass that was 3-4 orders of magnitude larger than the current one. In our
work, we investigate the possible origin of the peculiar inclination
distribution of the Trojans in the scenario where Jupiter migrates inwards. We
analyze different possibilities: (a) the secular evolution of an initially flat
Trojan population, (b) the presence of planetary embryos among the Trojans and
(c) capture of the Trojans from a pre-stirred planetesimal population. We find
that the secular evolution of the Trojans and Saturn do not affect the Trojan
inclinations appreciably, nor is there any significant mass depletion. Embryos
embedded in the swarms, in contrast, can stir the Trojan inclinations and can
also deplete the swarms efficiently, but it turns out that it is very difficult
to get rid of all of the massive bodies. We propose that the disc where
Jupiter's core was forming was already excited by the presence of other embryos
competing in Jupiter's core's feeding zone. We show that the trapped Trojans
preserve their high inclination through the gas phase of the disc and that
Saturn's perturbations are more effective on highly inclined Trojans, leading
to a lower capture efficiency and to a substantial depletion of the swarms.

various MXenes have shown magnetic properties suitable for applications in

magnetic properties of bimetallic and vacancy-ordered MXenes derived from a new

return stable magnetic materials. In particular, we have investigated the

modifying the MXene stoichiometry and/or MXene surface functionalization
changes MXene properties. After testing all possible combinations of metallic

$(V_{2/3}\square_{1/3})_2CF_2$ and $(V_{2/3}\square_{1/3})_2C(OH)_2$ as stable

FM intrinsic half-semiconductor with a remarkably high Curie temperature
($T_C$)) of 270 K. The $(V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2C(OH)_2$ MXene exhibits a rather low
work function (WF) (1.37 eV) and is thus a promising candidate for ultra-low
work function electron emitters. Conversely, the $(V_{2/3}\square_{1/3})_2CF_2$
MXene has a rather high WF and hence can be used as a hole injector for
Schottky-barrier-free contact applications. Overall, our proof-of-concept study
shows that theoretical predictions of MXene exfoliation and properties support
further experimental research towards developing spintronics devices.

dependence on primary mass can be explained by assuming that seed binary
companions are formed by disc fragmentation at random intervals during

circumbinary disk. A toy model based on simple prescriptions for the companion
growth and migration reproduces such aspects of close solar-mass binaries as
the distribution of binary periods P, the brown dwarf desert at short P, the
nearly uniform distribution of mass ratios, and a population of equal-mass
binaries (twins) that decreases linearly in frequency with logP. For massive
stars, the model predicts a large fraction of early mergers, a distribution of
logP with a negative slope, and a mass-ratio distribution that is also uniform
but with a substantially reduced twin fraction. By treating disc fragmentation
as a stochastic process, we also reproduce the observed properties of compact
triples. Success of our toy model suggests that most close binaries and compact

The main result of this paper is the following. If the black hole is extremal
with the nondimensional spin parameter $a_*> 1/2$, however close to the horizon
the light source would be, the escape probability remains nonzero. The
near-horizon limit value of the escape probability is a monotonically
increasing function of $a_*$ and takes a maximum $\sim$29.1\% at $a_*=1$, i.e.,
for the extremal Kerr case. On the other hand, if the black hole is extremal
with $0\leq a_*\leq 1/2$ or if the black hole is subextremal, the near-horizon

tracing out a spiral pattern are observed in the SE of the disk, while
significant azimuthal perturbations in the gas temperature are seen in the

Such low pitch-angled spirals are not readily explained through the wake of an
embedded planet in the location of previously reported at 94 au, but rather
require a launching mechanism which results in much more tightly wound spirals.
Molecular emission tracing distinct heights in the disk is required to
accurately distinguish between spiral launching mechanisms.

Here, we use simulations to explore the robustness of this phase transition

the critical driving field strength, a time crystal emerges, in which the
period of the limit cycles becomes an integer $n>1$ multiple of the driving

occuring in amorphous solids subject to oscillatory shear near the onset of

\to \mathcal{Y}$ by neural networks has a rich and thorough history dating back
to Kolmogorov (1957). In the case of learning finite dimensional maps, many
authors have shown various forms of the universality of both fixed depth and
fixed width neural networks. However, in many cases, these classical results
fail to extend to the recent use of approximations of neural networks with
infinitely many units for functional data analysis, dynamical systems
identification, and other applications where either $\mathcal{X}$ or
$\mathcal{Y}$ become infinite dimensional. Two questions naturally arise: which
infinite dimensional analogues of neural networks are sufficient to approximate
any map $f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$, and when do the finite approximations
to these analogues used in practice approximate $f$ uniformly over its infinite
dimensional domain $\mathcal{X}$?
  In this paper, we answer the open question of universal approximation of
nonlinear operators when $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ are both infinite
dimensional. We show that for a large class of different infinite analogues of
neural networks, any continuous map can be approximated arbitrarily closely
with some mild topological conditions on $\mathcal{X}$. Additionally, we
provide the first lower-bound on the minimal number of input and output units
required by a finite approximation to an infinite neural network to guarantee
that it can uniformly approximate any nonlinear operator using samples from its
inputs and outputs.

solutions of PDEs or integral equations. Our method relies on the direct
approximation of parametric solutions by neural networks, without need of
traditional numerical solves. This deep learning approach allows the accurate
and efficient approximation of parametric solutions in significantly higher
dimensions than is possible using classical discretisation schemes. Since the
approximated solutions can be cheaply evaluated, the solutions of Bayesian
inverse problems over large parameter spaces are efficient using Markov chain
Monte Carlo. We demonstrate the performance of our method using two real-world
examples; these include Bayesian inference in the PDE and integral equation
case for an example from electrochemistry, and Bayesian inference of a
function-valued heat-transfer parameter with applications in aviation.

this property can be used to study the many-body localization phase transition

transition. By tuning this parameter, we can detect key features of the MBL
transition: the divergence of the dynamical exponent due to Griffiths effects
in one dimension and the critical disorder strength. We apply these ideas to
study the MBL critical point numerically. The possibility to observe critical
signatures of the MBL transition in an open system allows for new numerical

we propose a scalable numerical scheme to study the MBL critical point using

observations may be explained by organic chemistry in C-rich environments. In
this study we first explore if the PDR complex nitrile observations can be
explained by gas-phase PDR chemistry alone if the elemental C/O ratio is
elevated. In the case of the Horsehead PDR, we find that gas-phase chemistry
with C/O $\gtrsim$ 0.9 can indeed explain the observed nitrile abundances,
increasing predicted abundances by several orders of magnitude compared to
standard C/O assumptions. We also find that the nitrile abundances are
sensitive to the cosmic ray ionization treatment, and provide constraints on
the branching ratios between CH3CN and CH3NC productions. In a fiducial disk
model, an elevated C/O ratio increases the CH3CN and HC3N productions by more
than an order of magnitude, bringing abundance predictions within an order of

be a key variable in predicting and interpreting complex organic molecule

efficiency of these different layers has not been measured when they operate
together on colorimetrically calibrated natural images and using multivariate

  In this work we present a statistical tool to address this question in an
appropriate (multivariate) way. Specifically, we propose an empirical estimate
of the information transmitted by the system based on a recent Gaussianization

Jacobian of a standard spatio-chromatic model of the retina-cortex pathway. If
the noise at certain representation is proportional to the dynamic range of the

follows the PDF of natural scenes over the chromatic and achromatic dimensions

the painting of black lines on the road. These attacks target deep neural

hijacking attacks, where painted lines on the road cause the driver-less car to
follow a target path. Through the use of network deconvolution, we provide

and power allocation problem in NOMA is NP-hard to solve in general, due to
complex impacts of signal superposition on each user's achievable data rates,
as well as combinatorial constraints on the number of multiplexed users per
sub-carrier to mitigate error propagation. In this family of problems, weighted
sum-rate (WSR) is an important objective function as it can achieve different
tradeoffs between sum-rate performance and user fairness. We propose a novel
approach to solve the WSR maximization problem in multi-carrier NOMA with
cellular power constraint. The problem is divided into two polynomial time
solvable sub-problems. First, the multi-carrier power control (given a fixed
subcarrier allocation) is non-convex. By taking advantage of its separability
property, we design an optimal and low complexity algorithm (MCPC) based on
projected gradient descent. Secondly, the single-carrier user selection is a
non-convex mixed-integer problem that we solve using dynamic programming
(SCUS). This work also aims to give an understanding on how each sub-problem's
particular structure can facilitate the algorithm design. In that respect, the
above MCPC and SCUS are basic building blocks that can be applied in a wide
range of resource allocation problems. Furthermore, we propose an efficient
heuristic to solve the general WSR maximization problem by combining MCPC and
SCUS. Numerical results show that it achieves near-optimal sum-rate with user
fairness, as well as significant performance improvement over OMA.

modalities that measure the weak electromagnetic fields generated by neural

generated these electromagnetic fields is a challenging ill-posed regression
problem known as \emph{source imaging}. When considering a group study, a
common approach consists in carrying out the regression tasks independently for
each subject. An alternative is to jointly localize sources for all subjects
taken together, while enforcing some similarity between them. By pooling all
measurements in a single multi-task regression, one makes the problem better
posed, offering the ability to identify more sources and with greater
precision. The Minimum Wasserstein Estimates (MWE) promotes focal activations
that do not perfectly overlap for all subjects, thanks to a regularizer based
on Optimal Transport (OT) metrics. MWE promotes spatial proximity on the
cortical mantel while coping with the varying noise levels across subjects. On
realistic simulations, MWE decreases the localization error by up to 4 mm per
source compared to individual solutions. Experiments on the Cam-CAN dataset
show a considerable improvement in spatial specificity in population imaging.
Our analysis of a multimodal dataset shows how multi-subject source
localization closes the gap between MEG and fMRI for brain mapping.

minimizes the loss. However, optimizing the scalarized (and weighted) loss does
not necessarily provide a guarantee of high performance on each possibly

learned relationship. In particular, the proposed method is to first define
relationship matrix, a mathematical representation of the inter-objective
relationship, and then create one actor and multiple critics that can co-learn
the relationship matrix and action selection. The proposed approach can
quantify the inter-objective relationship via reinforcement learning when the

the spacetime of a radiating body like star is studied in an energy dependent
gravity's rainbow, which is a UV completion of General Relativity. In our quest
we have used gravitational collapse as the main tool. The focus is to probe the
nature of singularity (black hole or naked singularity) formed out of the
collapsing procedure. This is achieved via a geodesic study. For our
investigation we have considered two different models of $f(R)$ gravity, namely
the inflationary Starobinsky's model and the power law model. Our study reveals
the fact that naked singularity is as good a possibility as black hole as far
as the central singularity is concerned. Via a proper fine tuning of the
initial data, we may realize both black hole or naked singularity as the end
state of the collapse. Thus this study is extremely important and relevant in
the light of the Cosmic Censorship hypothesis. The most important result
derived from the study is that gravity's rainbow increases the tendency of
formation of naked singularities. We have also deduced the conditions under
which the singularity will be a strong or weak curvature singularity. Finally
in our quest to know more about the model we have performed a thermodynamical
study. Throughout the study we have obtained results which involve deviation
from the classical set-up. Such deviations are expected in a quantum evolution

It is expected that this study will enhance our knowledge about quantization of

RNBRW gives a weight to each edge equal to the probability that a
non-backtracking random walk completes a cycle with that edge. Hence, edges
with larger weights may be thought of as more important to the formation of
cycles. Of note, since separate random walks can be performed in parallel,
RNBRW weights can be estimated very quickly, even for large graphs. We give

rates advise for a more immediate political action. A possible approach to this
key issue in global economy is to take historical time series for nominal
interest rates and inflation, and to construct then real interest rates and
finally obtaining the resulting discount rate according to a specific
stochastic model. Extended periods of negative real interest rates, in which
inflation dominates over nominal rates, are commonly observed, occurring in
many epochs and in all countries. This feature leads us to choose a well-known
model in statistical physics, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, as a basic
dynamical tool in which real interest rates randomly fluctuate and can become
negative, even if they tend to revert to a positive mean value. By covering 14
countries over hundreds of years we suggest different scenarios and include an
error analysis in order to consider the impact of statistical uncertainty in
our results. We find that only 4 of the countries have positive long-run
discount rates while the other ten countries have negative rates. Even if one
rejects the countries where hyperinflation has occurred, our results support
the need to consider low discounting rates. The results provided by these
fourteen countries significantly increase the priority of confronting global
actions such as climate change mitigation. We finally extend the analysis by
first allowing for fluctuations of the mean level in the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
model and secondly by considering modified versions of the Feller and lognormal
models. In both cases, results remain basically unchanged thus demonstrating
the robustness of the results presented.

define reduction relations in the pi-calculus to capture those two notions, and
we present two type systems from which one can extract a complexity bound on a
process. The type systems are inspired by input/output types and size types,

implementations in the past. Even highly sensitive software components like TLS
libraries are affected regularly. Resulting issues range from denial-of-service
attacks to the extraction of sensitive information. The complexity of protocols
and imprecise specifications in natural language are the core reasons for
subtle bugs in implementations, which are hard to find. The lack of precise
specifications impedes formal verification.
  In this paper, we propose a model and a corresponding domain-specific
language to formally specify message formats of existing real-world binary
protocols. A unique feature of the model is the capability to define
invariants, which specify relations and dependencies between message fields.
Furthermore, the model allows defining the relation of messages between
different protocol layers and thus ensures correct interpretation of payload
data. We present a technique to derive verifiable parsers based on the model,
generate efficient code for their implementation, and automatically prove the
absence of runtime errors. Examples of parser specifications for Ethernet and

approaches to manipulate them often rely on conservative strategies that
involve long series of very slow and incremental deformations, or various
mechanical fixtures such as clamps, pins or rings. We are interested in
manipulating freely moving cables, in real time, with a pair of robotic
grippers, and with no added mechanical constraints. The main contribution of
this paper is a perception and control framework that moves in that direction,
and uses real-time tactile feedback to accomplish the task of following a
dangling cable. The approach relies on a vision-based tactile sensor, GelSight,
that estimates the pose of the cable in the grip, and the friction forces
during cable sliding. We achieve the behavior by combining two tactile-based
controllers: 1) Cable grip controller, where a PD controller combined with a
leaky integrator regulates the gripping force to maintain the frictional
sliding forces close to a suitable value; and 2) Cable pose controller, where
an LQR controller based on a learned linear model of the cable sliding dynamics
keeps the cable centered and aligned on the fingertips to prevent the cable
from falling from the grip. This behavior is possible by a reactive gripper
fitted with GelSight-based high-resolution tactile sensors. The robot can
follow one meter of cable in random configurations within 2-3 hand regrasps,
adapting to cables of different materials and thicknesses. We demonstrate a
robot grasping a headphone cable, sliding the fingers to the jack connector,
and inserting it. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
implementation of real-time cable following without the aid of mechanical
fixtures.

in OR. Its future relevance for solving hard optimization problems in many
fields, including finance, logistics, production and design, is leveraged
through the increasing availability of powerful computing capabilities.
Acknowledging the existence of several literature reviews on parallel
optimization, we did not find reviews that cover the most recent literature on
the parallelization of both exact and (meta)heuristic methods. However, in the
past decade substantial advancements in parallel computing capabilities have
been achieved and used by OR scholars so that an overview of modern parallel
optimization in OR that accounts for these advancements is beneficial. Another
issue from previous reviews results from their adoption of different foci so
that concepts used to describe and structure prior literature differ. This
heterogeneity is accompanied by a lack of unifying frameworks for parallel
optimization across methodologies, application fields and problems, and it has
finally led to an overall fragmented picture of what has been achieved and
still needs to be done in parallel optimization in OR. This review addresses
the aforementioned issues with three contributions: First, we suggest a new
integrative framework of parallel computational optimization across
optimization problems, algorithms and application domains. The framework
integrates the perspectives of algorithmic design and computational
implementation of parallel optimization. Second, we apply the framework to
synthesize prior research on parallel optimization in OR, focusing on
computational studies published in the period 2008-2017. Finally, we suggest
research directions for parallel optimization in OR.

plausibly fill in a missing region of an image. Our proposed method builds on a
Bayesian estimate of heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty of a region of white

complexity of white matter as how accurately and confidently a well-trained

perform well on indoor scenes like the Middlebury dataset. When navigating
outdoors, reflective objects, like windows and glass, and thin obstacles, like
wires, are not well handled by most stereo disparity algorithms. Reflections,
repeating patterns and objects parallel to the cameras' baseline causes
mismatches between image pairs which leads to bad disparity estimates. Thin
obstacles are difficult for many sliding window based disparity methods to

the polarization of light to estimate the disparity of reflective objects. We
evaluate our approach on outdoor data that we collected. Our method contained
an average of 9.27% of bad pixels compared to a typical stereo algorithm's

methods in both imitation learning and non-imitation learning. We also
highlight the emerging technologies adopted by some leading AV companies, e.g.
Tesla, Waymo, and Comma.ai. We find that: i) the AV industry has been mostly
focusing on the long tail problem related to safety and overlooked the impact
on traffic congestion, ii) the current public self-driving datasets have not
included enough congestion scenarios, and mostly lack the necessary input
features/output labels to train mMP, and iii) albeit reinforcement learning

major mMP method adopted by industry is still behavior cloning (BC), whose
capability to learn a congestion-mitigating mMP remains to be seen. Based on
the review, the study identifies the research gaps in current mMP development.
Some suggestions towards congestion mitigation for future mMP studies are
proposed: i) enrich data collection to facilitate the congestion learning, ii)
incorporate non-imitation learning methods to combine traffic efficiency into a
safety-oriented technical route, and iii) integrate domain knowledge from the
traditional car following (CF) theory to improve the string stability of mMP.

question. We approach this question not from a physiological standpoint as to
how information is physically stored in the brain, but from a conceptual and
algorithm standpoint as to the right data structures to be used to organize and
index information. Here we propose a memory architecture directly based on the
recursive sketching ideas from the paper ""Recursive Sketches for Modular Deep
Networks"", ICML 2019 (arXiv:1905.12730), to store information in memory as
concise sketches. We also give a high level, informal exposition of the
recursive sketching idea from the paper that makes use of subspace embeddings
to capture deep network computations into a concise sketch. These sketches form
an implicit knowledge graph that can be used to find related information via
sketches from the past while processing an event.

  Nonlinear Neural Decomposition","Accepted at Findings of EMNLP 2020",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Word-embeddings are vital components of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
models and have been extensively explored. However, they consume a lot of
memory which poses a challenge for edge deployment. Embedding matrices,
typically, contain most of the parameters for language models and about a third
for machine translation systems. In this paper, we propose Distilled Embedding,
an (input/output) embedding compression method based on low-rank matrix
decomposition and knowledge distillation. First, we initialize the weights of
our decomposed matrices by learning to reconstruct the full pre-trained
word-embedding and then fine-tune end-to-end, employing knowledge distillation
on the factorized embedding. We conduct extensive experiments with various
compression rates on machine translation and language modeling, using different
data-sets with a shared word-embedding matrix for both embedding and vocabulary
projection matrices. We show that the proposed technique is simple to
replicate, with one fixed parameter controlling compression size, has higher
BLEU score on translation and lower perplexity on language modeling compared to
complex, difficult to tune state-of-the-art methods.

they perform crudely because they overlook the requisite precursors to thermal
comfort. They also fail to exclusively cool or heat the parts of the body
(e.g., the wrist, the feet, and the head) that influence the most a person's
thermal comfort satisfaction. Instead, they waste energy by heating or cooling
the whole room. This research investigates the influence of neck-coolers on
people's thermal comfort perception and proposes an effective method that
delivers thermal comfort depending on people's heart rate variability (HRV).
Moreover, because thermal comfort is idiosyncratic and depends on unforeseeable
circumstances, only person-specific thermal comfort models are adequate for
this task. Unfortunately, using person-specific models would be costly and
inflexible for deployment in, e.g., a smart building because a system that uses
person-specific models would require collecting extensive training data from
each person in the building. As a compromise, we devise a hybrid,
cost-effective, yet satisfactory technique that derives a personalized
person-specific-like model from samples collected from a large population. For
example, it was possible to double the accuracy of a generic model (from 47.77%
to 96.11%) using only 400 person-specific calibration samples. Finally, we
propose a practical implementation of a real-time thermal comfort provision
system that uses this strategy and highlighted its advantages and limitations.

to tune the hyper-parameters of ANFIS based on the data-set. The Liver diseases
characteristics are taken from the UCI Repository of Machine Learning
Databases. The number of these characteristic attributes are 7, and the sample

sensitivity and specificity analysis, respectively. According to the
experimental results, the performance of ANFIS-PSO can be more considerable
than traditional FIS and ANFIS without optimization phase.

interest to industry, but are challenging due to the coupled physics and
dynamic nature of the processes. With the advancement in hardware and
computational capabilities, the next generation of computational methods, so
called meshless methods, have received significant attention. Among all
meshless methods, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has received major
consideration. The main advantage of the SPH method is to bypass the
requirement for a numerical grid to calculate spatial derivatives. This avoids
severe problems associated with mesh tangling and distortion which usually
occur in Lagrangian analysis involving high-strain-rate events. In this study
to better understand the effects of oxide layer, coating and diffused materials
on weldability, a novel hybrid SPH platform was developed. Then, the high-speed
impact between Steel/Steel, Copper/Titanium, and Aluminum/Steel were simulated.
To experimentally validate the numerical efforts, results were compared to
vaporizing foil actuator welding and explosive welding tests. Good agreement
between the numerical simulations and experimental results provided confidence
in the numerical modeling.
