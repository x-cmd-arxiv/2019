the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (\textit{TESS}) are analysed to
search for variability. Our analysis shows that HD~27463 exhibits two types of
photometric variability. The low frequency variability with the period $P$
=~2.834274 $\pm$ 0.000008 d can be explained in terms of axial stellar rotation
assuming the oblique magnetic rotator model and presence of surface
abundance/brightness spots, while the detected high-frequency variations are
characteristics of $\delta$~Scuti pulsations. From the analysis of Balmer line
profiles visible in two FEROS spectra of HD~27463 we have derived its effective
temperature and surface gravity, finding values that are close to those
published for this star in the \textit{TESS} Input Catalogue (TIC). Knowing the
rotation period and the v$\sin{i}$ value estimated from the fitting of Balmer
line profiles we found that the rotational axis is inclined to the line of
sight with an angle of $i=33\pm8\deg$. Our best-fitting model of the observed
pulsation modes results in an overshoot parameter value $f_{ov} = 0.014$ and
values of global stellar parameters that are in good agreement with the data
reported in the TIC and with the data derived from fitting Balmer line
profiles. This model indicates an age of 5.0 $\pm$~0.4 $\times 10^8$~yrs, which
corresponds to a core hydrogen fraction of 0.33.

fraction of the density-fitting error from the calculated total coupled-cluster

integrals as a perturbation, and simplified response-like equations allow to
calculate improved amplitudes and the corresponding energy correction. The
proposed method is tested at the coupled-cluster singles and doubles level of
theory for a diverse set of moderately-sized molecules. On average, error
reductions by a factor of approximately ten and twenty are observed in
double-zeta and triple-zeta basis sets, respectively. Similar reductions are
observed in calculations of interaction energies of several model complexes.
The computational cost of the procedure is small in comparison with the
preceding coupled-cluster iterations. The applicability of the method is not
limited to the density-fitting approximation; in principle, it can be used in
conjunction with an arbitrary decomposition scheme of the electron repulsion
integrals.

After aligning the automatically recognised words with different regions of the

coordinates of the area of interests (AOI)s, time spent in AOI, time to reach
the AOI, and the number of AOI visits. Using the DementiaBank dataset we train
a binary classifier (AD vs. healthy control) using 10-fold cross-validation and
achieve an 80% F1-score using the timing information from the forced alignments
of the automatic speech recogniser (ASR); this achieved around 72% using the

potential of probing a cosmological time evolution of the Higgs boson
self-coupling constant $\lambda$ and thus the Higgs boson's mass $m_H= \sqrt{ 2
\lambda} v$. The phase transition of the Standard Model could have been a first
order one if the Higgs mass was below 72 GeV at a temperature $T_\star \ge 100$
GeV. Gravitational waves could thus have been produced during the electroweak
phase transition. A discovery by LISA of a stochastic background of
gravitational waves with a characteristic frequency $k_\star \ge 10^{-5}$ Hz
could be interpreted as a sign that the Higgs boson self-coupling constant was
smaller in the past. This interpretation would be particularly tempting if the
Large Hadron Collider did not discover any physics beyond the Standard Model by
the time such waves are seen. The same mechanism could also account for
baryogenesis.

resonance imaging by retrospective head motion correction on a variety of

against rigid-body motion is based on distributed and incoherent sampling
orders for boosting a joint retrospective motion estimation and reconstruction
framework. Motion resilience stems from the encoding redundancy in the data, as
generally provided by the coil array. Hence, it does not require external
sensors, navigators or training data, so the methodology is readily applicable
to sequences using 3D encodings. Results: Simulations are performed showing
full inter-shot corrections for usual levels of in-vivo motion, large number of
shots, standard levels of noise and moderate acceleration factors. Feasibility
of inter- and intra-shot corrections is shown under controlled motion in-vivo.
Practical efficacy is illustrated by high quality results in most corrupted of

neural networks trained to infer semantic segmentation and depth from stereo
images are often the preferred choices. Specifically, Semantic Stereo Matching
can be tackled by either standalone models trained for the two tasks
independently or joint end-to-end architectures. Nonetheless, as proposed so
far, both solutions are inefficient because requiring two forward passes in the
former case or due to the complexity of a single network in the latter,
although jointly tackling both tasks is usually beneficial in terms of
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a single compact and lightweight

candidate output document and the ""reverse translation probability"" of
translating the candidate output back into the source language. Our proposed
model uses a powerful autoregressive language model as the prior on target

independently from the target to the source language. Crucially, at test time,
when a source document is observed, the document language model prior induces
dependencies between the translations of the source sentences in the posterior.
The model's independence assumption not only enables efficient use of available

present an approximate analytical solution of the coupled set of equations
describing the evolution of the angular velocity and the inclination angle
between rotation and magnetic axis of a neutron star in the presence of a
co-rotating plasma. We also show how the solution can be generalized to the
case of evolving magnetic fields. We determine the evolution of the spin

sampling properties may be critical to apply state-of-the-art learning-based
(e.g., auto-encoders, CNNs,...), fully benefit from the available large-scale
observations and reach breakthroughs in the reconstruction and identification
of processes of interest. In this paper, we address the end-to-end learning of
representations of signals, images and image sequences from irregularly-sampled
data, i.e. when the training data involved missing data. From an analogy to
Bayesian formulation, we consider energy-based representations. Two energy
forms are investigated: one derived from auto-encoders and one relating to
Gibbs priors. The learning stage of these energy-based representations (or
priors) involve a joint interpolation issue, which amounts to solving an energy
minimization problem under observation constraints. Using a
neural-network-based implementation of the considered energy forms, we can
state an end-to-end learning scheme from irregularly-sampled data. We
demonstrate the relevance of the proposed representations for different
case-studies: namely, multivariate time series, 2D images and image sequences.

large-scale strongly correlated quantum many-body problems. The main idea of
quantum embedding is to glue together a highly accurate quantum theory at the
local scale and a less accurate quantum theory at the global scale. We
introduce the first quantum embedding theory that is also variational, in that
it is guaranteed to provide a one-sided bound for the exact ground-state
energy. Our method, which we call the variational embedding method, provides a
lower bound for this quantity. The method relaxes the representability
conditions for quantum marginals to a set of linear and semidefinite
constraints that operate at both local and global scales, resulting in a
semidefinite program (SDP) to be solved numerically. The accuracy of the method
can be systematically improved. The method is versatile and can be applied, in
particular, to quantum many-body problems for both quantum spin systems and
fermionic systems, such as those arising from electronic structure
calculations. We describe how the proper notion of quantum marginal,
sufficiently general to accommodate both of these settings, should be phrased
in terms of certain algebras of operators. We also investigate the duality
theory for our SDPs, which offers valuable perspective on our method as an
embedding theory. As a byproduct of this investigation, we describe a
formulation for efficiently implementing the variational embedding method via a
partial dualization procedure and the solution of quantum analogs of the
Kantorovich problem from optimal transport theory.

semiconducting nanowires with a zinc-blende lattice. The effective Dresselhaus
term is derived for various growth directions, including <11(-2)>-oriented
nanowires. While a specific configuration exists where the Dresselhaus
spin-orbit coupling is suppressed even at confinement potentials of low
symmetry, many configurations allow for a strong Dresselhaus coupling. In
particular, we discuss qualitative and quantitative results for nanowire
cross-sections modeled after sectors of rings or circles. The parameter
dependence is analyzed in detail, enabling predictions for a large variety of
setups. For example, we gain insight into the spin-orbit coupling in recently
fabricated GaAs-InAs nanomembrane-nanowire structures. By combining the
effective Dresselhaus and Rashba terms, we find that such structures are
promising platforms for applications where an electrically controllable
spin-orbit interaction is needed. If the nanowire cross-section is scaled down
and InAs replaced by InSb, remarkably high Dresselhaus-based spin-orbit
energies of the order of millielectronvolt are expected. A Rashba term that is
similar to the effective Dresselhaus term can be induced via electric gates,
providing means to switch the spin-orbit interaction on and off. By varying the
central angle of the circular sector, we find, among other things, that
particularly strong Dresselhaus couplings are possible when nanowire
cross-sections resemble half-disks.

leveraging new data and avoiding the forgetting effect-- is an essential
obstacle to achieving human intelligence level in speech recognition. An
obvious approach to leverage data from a new domain (e.g., new accented speech)
is to first generate a comprehensive dataset of all domains, by combining all
available data, and then use this dataset to retrain the acoustic models.
However, as the amount of training data grows, storing and retraining on such a
large-scale dataset becomes practically impossible. To deal with this problem,
in this study, we study several domain expansion techniques which exploit only
the data of the new domain to build a stronger model for all domains. These
techniques are aimed at learning the new domain with a minimal forgetting
effect (i.e., they maintain original model performance). These techniques
modify the adaptation procedure by imposing new constraints including (1)
weight constraint adaptation (WCA): keeping the model parameters close to the
original model parameters; (2) elastic weight consolidation (EWC): slowing down
training for parameters that are important for previously established domains;
(3) soft KL-divergence (SKLD): restricting the KL-divergence between the
original and the adapted model output distributions; and (4) hybrid SKLD-EWC:
incorporating both SKLD and EWC constraints. We evaluate these techniques in an
accent adaptation task in which we adapt a deep neural network (DNN) acoustic
model trained with native English to three different English accents:
Australian, Hispanic, and Indian. The experimental results show that SKLD
significantly outperforms EWC, and EWC works better than WCA. The hybrid
SKLD-EWC technique results in the best overall performance.

the visual invariances afforded by the agent's perspective, or frame of

Spectroscopy of exoplanets is very challenging because of the high
star-planet contrast. A technical difficulty in the design of imaging
instruments is the noncommon path aberrations (NCPAs) between the adaptive
optics (AO) sensing and the science camera, which induce planet-resembling
stellar speckles in the coronagraphic science images. In an observing sequence
of several long exposures, quickly evolving NCPAs average out and leave behind
an AO halo that adds photon noise to the planet detection. Static NCPA can be
calibrated a posteriori using differential imaging techniques. However, NCPAs
that evolve during the observing sequence do not average out and cannot be
calibrated a posteriori. These quasi-static NCPAs are one of the main
limitations of the current direct imaging instruments such as SPHERE, GPI, and
SCExAO.
  Aims. Our aim is to actively minimize the quasi-static speckles induced in
long-exposure images. To do so, we need to measure the quasi-static speckle
field above the AO halo.
  Methods. The self-coherent camera (SCC) is a proven technique which measures
the speckle complex field in the coronagraphic science images. It is routinely
used on the THD2 bench to reach contrast levels of <10^{-8} in the range 5-12
{\lambda}/D in space-related conditions. To test the SCC in ground conditions
on THD2, we optically simulated the residual aberrations measured behind the
SPHERE/VLT AO system under good observing conditions.
  Results. We demonstrate in the laboratory that the SCC can minimize the
quasi-static speckle intensity in the science images down to a limitation set
by the AO halo residuals. The SCC reaches 1{\sigma} raw contrast levels below
10^{-6} in the region 5-12 {\lambda}/D at 783.25 nm in our experiments.

(our 1-dimensional hydrodynamic code) to accrete solar matter until the TNR is
ongoing and then switch to a mixed composition (either 25% WD material and 75%
solar or 50% WD material and 50% solar). Because the amount of accreted
material is inversely proportional to the initial $^{12}$C abundance, by first
accreting solar matter the amount of material taking part in the outburst is
larger than in those simulations where we assume a mixed composition from the

although the ejected gases are enriched in WD material, the WDs in these

also enforce a more general type of conditions $f(m_{ij})=0$ with $f$ some

non-vanishing with no reduction in its predictive power. We classify all

effective operator is generated and can thus remain covert, in the sense that
no explicit evidence of the symmetry can be read off the neutrino mass matrix,

implies the emergence of $n-1$ conserved $U(1)$ charges from only discrete

unnaturally large parameter regime despite the apparent existence of
symmetry-allowed relevant operators in the field theory. This suggests that
either these spin chains have hidden conserved quantities not previously

frustration effects of the lattice Hamiltonian. We argue that similar features

interior mixing profiles lead to enhanced core masses of eMSTO stars and can
explain a good fraction of the observed eMSTOs of the two considered clusters

properties of the stars in NGC 884 are not sufficiently well known to perform
asteroseismic modelling, as it is achieved for field stars from space
photometry. The stars in NGC 884 for which we have vsini and a few pulsation
frequencies show no correlation between these properties and the core masses of
the stars that set the cluster age. Future cluster space asteroseismology may
allow to interpret the values of the core masses in terms of the physical
processes that cause them, based on the modelling of the interior mixing
profiles for the individual member stars with suitable identified modes.

their dark matter component. Applying this framework to the SIMBA cosmological
simulations, we show that 40% (10%) of cosmological baryons have moved $>
1h^{-1}~ {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ ($3h^{-1}~ {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$) by $z=0$, due primarily to
entrainment of gas by jets powered by AGN, with baryons moving up to $12h^{-1}~

the dark matter component due to hydrodynamic forces, radiative cooling, and
feedback processes. As a result, only 60% of the gas content in a given halo at

A typical halo in the mass range $M_{\rm vir} = 10^{12}$--$10^{13}{\rm

mass, and substructure fraction of the dark matter distribution of the Galaxy.
However, most details of the phase-space distribution of the stream are not
fully explained, and dynamical models that use the stream for other inferences
are therefore incomplete. Here we aim to measure distance and kinematic
properties along the Pal 5 stream in order to motivate improved models of the
system. We use a large catalog of RR Lyrae-type stars (RRLs) with astrometric
data from the Gaia mission to probabilistically identify RRLs in the Pal 5

candles and their distances can be inferred with small relative precision

in proper motion and distance, we find 27 RRLs consistent with being members of
the cluster (10) and stream (17). Using these RRLs, we detect gradients in
distance and proper motion along the stream, and provide an updated measurement

$N=\{3,4\}$, in principle this provides an unexplored data analysis window with
new discovery potential. We derive estimators for arbitrary $N$-point functions

the heavy particle production phenomenology reduces to a classical Poisson

assessment of the scaling relations involving M, Z and SFR, which provide
powerful constraints for the chemical evolution models. We parametrise the MZR
with a new functional form which allows us to better characterise the turnover
mass. The slope and saturation metallicity are in good agreement with previous
determinations of the MZR based on the Te method, while showing significantly
lower normalisation compared to those based on photoionisation models. The Z-
SFR dependence at fixed stellar mass is also investigated, being particularly
evident for highly star forming galaxies, where the scatter in metallicity is
reduced up to a factor of ~30%. A new parametrisation of the FMR is given by
explicitly introducing the SFR-dependence of the turnover mass into the MZR.
The residual scatter in metallicity for the global galaxy population around the
new FMR is 0.054 dex. The new FMR presented in this work represents a useful
local benchmark to compare theoretical predictions and observational studies
(of both local and high-redshift galaxies) whose metallicity measurements are
tied to the abundance scale defined by the Te method, hence allowing to
properly assess its evolution with cosmic time.

population at high redshifts and the highest luminosities, and may be
associated with a transitional ""blowout"" phase of black hole and galaxy
co-evolution models. Despite this, their high-energy properties have been
poorly known. We use the overall sample of $10$ objects with XMM-Newton
coverage to study the high-energy properties of HRQs at $\left< L_{\rm bol}

with strong X-ray detections, we perform spectral analyses. These find a median
X-ray luminosity of $\left< L_{\rm 2-10\,keV} \right> = 10^{45.1}$ erg/s,
comparable to the most powerful X-ray quasars known. The gas column densities
are $N_{\rm H}=(1$-$8)\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, in agreement with the amount
of dust extinction observed. The dust to gas ratios are sub-Galactic, but are
higher than found in local AGN. The intrinsic X-ray luminosities of HRQs are
weak compared to the mid-infrared ($L_{\rm 6\mu m}$) and bolometric
luminosities ($L_{\rm bol}$), in agreement with findings for other luminous
quasar samples. For instance, the X-ray to bolometric corrections range from
$\kappa_{\rm bol}\approx 50$-$3000$. The moderate absorption levels and
accretion rates close to the Eddington limit ($\left< \lambda_{\rm Edd}

that the HRQs lie in the forbidden region of the $N_{\rm H}$-$\lambda_{\rm

interstellar medium may be driving a phase of blowout that has been ongoing for
a few $10^{5}$ years. The wider properties, including [OIII] narrow-line region

System, with high-temperature materials thought to originate close to the
central star found in the cold, outer regions of the disks. While models have
shown this redistribution is possible through a variety of mechanisms, these
models have generally ignored the possible growth of solids via grain-grain
collisions that would occur during transit. Here we investigate the interplay
of coagulation and radial and vertical transport of solids in protoplanetary
disks, considering cases where growth is limited by bouncing or by
fragmentation. We find that in all cases, growth effectively limits the ability
for materials to be carried outward or preserved at large distances from the

drift inwards rapidly under the effects of gas drag. We discuss the
implications for mixing in protoplanetary disks, and how the preservation of
high temperature materials in outer disks may require structures or outward

axis in materials consisting of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM)
layers, generally after a cooling procedure in high magnetic field. This effect
is highly desirable for technological applications ranging from spintronics to
magnetic recording. Achieving giant EB effect near room temperature in a small
cooling field is thus an on-going technologically relevant challenge for the
materials science community. In this work, we present the experimental
realization of such a fundamental goal by demonstrating the existence of giant
EB after a zero field cooled (ZFC) procedure in antiperovskite Mn3.5Co0.5N
below 256 K. We found that it exhibits an EB field of 0.28 T at 50 K after a
ZFC procedure accompanied by a large vertical magnetization shift (VMS).
Interestingly, this EB field can be elevated up to 1.2 T after a cooling
procedure with a small applied field of just 500 Oe. Mn3:5Co0:5N bears the
first intermetallic material showing a strong correlation between EB and VMS.We
attribute the observed EB effect to a completely new canted triangular magnetic
structure determined by neutron diffraction experiment. Finally, we discuss the
striking effect of Co substitution on the physical properties of antiperovskite
materials and put forward a new strategy for antiperovskite lattice to exploit
new single phase materials showing large EB effect at room temperature.

of hard slender colloidal particles subjected to an external orienting field.
In the formulation and liquid-state processing of nanocomposite materials, the
alignment of particles by external fields such as electric, magnetic or flow
fields is practically inevitable, and often works against the emergence of
large nanoparticle networks. Using continuum percolation theory in conjunction
with Onsager theory, we investigate how the interplay between externally
induced alignment and the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the uniaxial nematic
phase affects cluster formation within nanoparticle dispersions. It is known
that the enhancement of particle alignment by means of a density increase or an
external field may result in the breakdown of an already percolating network.
As a result, percolation can be limited to a small region of the phase diagram
only. Here, we demonstrate that the existence and shape of such a ""percolation
island"" in the phase diagram crucially depends on the connectivity length -- a
critical distance defining direct connections between neighbouring particles.
Deformations of this percolation island can lead to peculiar re-entrance
effects, in which a system-spanning network forms and breaks down multiple
times with increasing particle density.

Cu$_{1/3}$Ag$_{1/3}$Au$_{1/3}$CN, with intriguing thermal properties is
explored. All the current known related compounds with straight-chain
structures, such as CuCN, AgCN, AuCN and M$_x$M'$_{1-x}$CN (M, M' = Cu, Ag,
Au), exhibit 1D negative thermal expansion (NTE) along the chains and positive
thermal expansion (PTE) perpendicular to them. Cu$_{1/3}$Ag$_{1/3}$Au$_{1/3}$CN
exhibits similar PTE perpendicular to the chains, however PTE, rather than NTE,
is also observed along the chains. In order to understand the origin of this
unexpected behavior, inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements were
carried out, underpinned by DFT calculations. Synchrotron-based PDF analysis
and 13C SSNMR measurements were also performed to build an input structural
model for the lattice dynamical study. The results indicate that transverse
motions of the metal ions are responsible for the PTE perpendicular to the
chains, as is the case for the related group 11 cyanides. However NTE along the
chain due to the tension effect of these transverse motions is not observed.
For this system, DFT-based phonon calculations predict small PTE along the
chain due to low-energy chain-slipping modes induced by a bond-rotation effect
on the weak metallophilic bonds. However the observed PTE is greater than that
predicted with the straight-chain model. Small bends in the chain to
accommodate truly co-planar metals provide an alternative explanation for
thermal behavior. These would mitigate the tension effect induced by the
transverse motions of the metals and, as temperature increases and the chains
move further apart, a straightening could occur resulting in the observed PTE.
This hypothesis is further supported by unusual evolution in the phonon
spectra, which suggest small changes in local symmetry with temperature.

discovering generic paraphrases, they often fail to identify domain-specific
paraphrases (e.g., {staff, concierge} in the hospitality domain). This is
because current techniques are often based on statistical methods, while
domain-specific corpora are too small to fit statistical methods. In this
paper, we present an unsupervised graph-based technique to mine paraphrases
from a small set of sentences that roughly share the same topic or intent. Our
system, Essentia, relies on word-alignment techniques to create a
word-alignment graph that merges and organizes tokens from input sentences. The
resulting graph is then used to generate candidate paraphrases. We demonstrate
that our system obtains high-quality paraphrases, as evaluated by crowd
workers. We further show that the majority of the identified paraphrases are
domain-specific and thus complement existing paraphrase databases.

singularities of the mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ for all $n\geq

an $S^{n-1}\times \mathbb{R}$ singularity at $(x_0,t_0)$, then there exists an
$\varepsilon=\varepsilon(x_0,t_0)>0$ such that $M_t\cap B(x_0,\varepsilon)$ is
mean-convex for all $t\in(t_0-\varepsilon^2,t_0+\varepsilon^2)$. As in the case
$n=2$, which was resolved by the first three authors in arXiv:1810.08467, the
existence of such a mean-convex neighborhood follows from classifying a certain
class of ancient Brakke flows that arise as potential blowup limits near a neck
singularity. Specifically, we prove that any ancient unit-regular integral
Brakke flow with a cylindrical blowdown must be either a round shrinking
cylinder, a translating bowl soliton, or an ancient oval. In particular,
combined with a prior result of the last two authors, we obtain uniqueness of
mean curvature flow through neck singularities.
  The main difficulty in addressing the higher dimensional case is in promoting
the spectral analysis on the cylinder to global geometric properties of the
solution. Most crucially, due to the potential wide variety of self-shrinking
flows with entropy lower than the cylinder when $n\geq 3$, smoothness does not
follow from the spectral analysis by soft arguments. This precludes the use of
the classical moving plane method to derive symmetry. To overcome this, we
introduce a novel variant of the moving plane method, which we call ""moving
plane method without assuming smoothness"" - where smoothness and symmetry are
established in tandem.

methods based on selection on observables (assuming a quasi-random treatment
given observed covariates), instrumental variables (inducing a quasi-random
shift in the treatment), difference-in-differences and changes-in-changes
(exploiting changes in outcomes over time), as well as regression
discontinuities and kinks (using changes in the treatment assignment at some

suited for data with many observations for a flexible (i.e. semi- or
nonparametric) modeling of treatment effects, and/or many (i.e. high
dimensional) observed covariates by applying machine learning to select and
control for covariates in a data-driven way. This is not only useful for
tackling confounding by controlling for instance for factors jointly affecting
the treatment and the outcome, but also for learning effect heterogeneities
across subgroups defined upon observable covariates and optimally targeting
those groups for which the treatment is most effective.

run faster than AllReduce-based methods, which use blocking communication

a slow momentum (SlowMo) framework, where workers periodically synchronize and
perform a momentum update, after multiple iterations of a base optimization
algorithm. Experiments on image classification and machine translation tasks
demonstrate that SlowMo consistently yields improvements in optimization and
generalization performance relative to the base optimizer, even when the
additional overhead is amortized over many updates so that the SlowMo runtime
is on par with that of the base optimizer. We provide theoretical convergence
guarantees showing that SlowMo converges to a stationary point of smooth
non-convex losses. Since BMUF can be expressed through the SlowMo framework,
our results also correspond to the first theoretical convergence guarantees for
BMUF.

because of higher planetesimal surface density induced by a migrating Jupiter.
Planetary embryos that grow rapidly experience radiogenic ingrowth of mantle
$^{182}$W that is inconsistent with the measured terrestrial composition,
unless much of the tungsten is removed by an impactor core that mixes
thoroughly with the target mantle. For physically Earth-like surviving planets,
we find that the fraction of equilibrating impactor core $k_\text{core} \geq
0.6$ is required to produce results agreeing with observed terrestrial tungsten
anomalies (assuming equilibration with relatively large volumes of target
mantle material; smaller equilibrating mantle volumes would require even larger

surrounding the image segments. While convolutional neural networks have
brought state of the art accuracies within object detection, errors arise when
objects in different classes share similar features. This scenario often occurs
when objects in images are viewed at too small of a scale to discern distinct
differences in features, causing images to be incorrectly classified or
localized. To solve this problem, we will explore using context when
classifying image segments. This technique involves feeding a convolutional
neural network a central square image along with a border of its direct
surroundings at train and test times. This means that although images are
labelled at a smaller scale to preserve accurate localization, the network
classifies the images and learns features that include the wider context. We
demonstrate the benefits of this context technique in the object detection task
through a case study of grass (foxtail) and grass-like (yellow nutsedge) weed
detection in maize fields. In this standard situation, adding context alone
nearly halved the error of the neural network from 7.1% to 4.3%. After only one
epoch with context, the network also achieved a higher accuracy than the
network without context did after 50 epochs. The benefits of using the context
technique are likely to particularly evident in agricultural contexts in which
parts (such as leaves) of several plants may appear similar when not taking

from peer to peer. Examples include communicable diseases, rumors,
misinformation, ideas, innovations, bank failures, and electrical blackouts.
Sometimes, as in the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, a contagion mutates at some
point as it spreads through a network. Here, using a simple
susceptible-infected (SI) model of contagion, we explore the downstream impact
of a single mutation event. Assuming that this mutation occurs at a random node
in the contact network, we calculate the distribution of the number of
""descendants,"" $d$, downstream from the initial ""Patient Zero"" mutant. We find
that the tail of the distribution decays as $d^{-2}$ for complete graphs,
random graphs, small-world networks, networks with block-like structure, and
other infinite-dimensional networks. This prediction agrees with the observed
statistics of memes propagating and mutating on Facebook, and is expected to
hold for other effectively infinite-dimensional networks, such as the global
human contact network. In a wider context, our approach suggests a possible
starting point for a mesoscopic theory of contagion. Such a theory would focus
on the paths traced by a spreading contagion, thereby furnishing an
intermediate level of description between that of individual nodes and the
total infected population. We anticipate that contagion pathways will hold
valuable lessons, given their role as the conduits through which single
mutations, innovations, or failures can sweep through a network as a whole.

6.6-keV $^{16}$O$^{+}$ + H$_{2}$O collisions. Absolute cross sections for the
emission of all positively and negatively charged fragments, differential in
both energy and observation angle, were measured. The fragments formed in hard,
binary collisions appearing in peaks were distinguishable from those created in
soft collisions with many-body dynamics that result in a broad energy spectrum.
A striking feature is that anions and cations are emitted with similar energy
and angular distributions, with a nearly constant ratio of about 1:100 for
H$^{-}$ to H$^{+}$. Model calculations were performed at different levels of
complexity. Four-body scattering simulations reproduce the measured fragment
distributions if adequate kinetic-energy release of the target is taken into
account. Providing even further insight into the underlying processes,
predictions of a thermodynamic model indicate that transfer ionization at small
impact parameters is the dominant mechanism for H$^{+}$ creation. The present
findings confirm our earlier observation that in molecular fragmentation
induced by slow, singly charged ions, the charge states of the emitted hydrogen
fragments follow a simple statistical distribution independent of the way they
are formed.

high-resolution images to enhance features, such as microtubule networks in
high-throughput low-resolution images. We show that CycleGAN is effective in

the need for an optimal constellation design method for complex regional

suboptimal solutions for periodically time-varying or spatially-varying
regional coverage requirements. This paper introduces a new general approach to
design an optimal constellation pattern that satisfies such complex regional
coverage requirements. To this end, the circular convolution nature of the
repeating ground track orbit and common ground track constellation is
formalized. This formulation enables a scalable constellation pattern analysis
for multiple target areas and with multiple sub-constellations. The formalized
circular convolution relationship is first used to derive a baseline
constellation pattern design method with the conventional assumption of
symmetry. Next, a novel method based on binary integer linear programming is
developed, which aims to optimally design a constellation pattern with the
minimum number of satellites. This binary integer linear programming method is
shown to achieve optimal constellation patterns for general problem settings
that the baseline method cannot achieve. Five illustrative examples are
analyzed to demonstrate the value of the proposed new approach.

the GMIR's average speed through the heliosheath (inside the heliopause) as a

with particle, field, and plasma observations enables us to infer previously
unmeasured properties of the heliosheath, including a range of sound speeds and

  Time-varying Optimization Approach",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop an optimization-based framework for joint real-time trajectory
planning and feedback control of feedback-linearizable systems. To achieve this
goal, we define a target trajectory as the optimal solution of a time-varying
optimization problem. In general, however, such trajectory may not be feasible
due to , e.g., nonholonomic constraints. To solve this problem, we design a
control law that generates feasible trajectories that asymptotically converge
to the target trajectory. More precisely, for systems that are (dynamic)
full-state linearizable, the proposed control law implicitly transforms the
nonlinear system into an optimization algorithm of sufficiently high order. We
prove global exponential convergence to the target trajectory for both the
optimization algorithm and the original system. We illustrate the effectiveness
of our proposed method on multi-target or multi-agent tracking problems with
constraints.

  2020",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In reinforcement learning (RL), sparse rewards are a natural way to specify
the task to be learned. However, most RL algorithms struggle to learn in this
setting since the learning signal is mostly zeros. In contrast, humans are good
at assessing and predicting the future consequences of actions and can serve as
good reward/policy shapers to accelerate the robot learning process. Previous
works have shown that the human brain generates an error-related signal,
measurable using electroencephelography (EEG), when the human perceives the
task being done erroneously. In this work, we propose a method that uses
evaluative feedback obtained from human brain signals measured via scalp EEG to
accelerate RL for robotic agents in sparse reward settings. As the robot learns
the task, the EEG of a human observer watching the robot attempts is recorded
and decoded into noisy error feedback signal. From this feedback, we use
supervised learning to obtain a policy that subsequently augments the behavior
policy and guides exploration in the early stages of RL. This bootstraps the RL
learning process to enable learning from sparse reward. Using a robotic
navigation task as a test bed, we show that our method achieves a stable
obstacle-avoidance policy with high success rate, outperforming learning from
sparse rewards only that struggles to achieve obstacle avoidance behavior or
fails to advance to the goal.

iodine calibrated spectra of three RV standard stars regularly observed by

water vapor (PWV) contents over a one-year period. We concluded that telluric
contamination introduces additional RV noise and spurious periodic signals on
the level of 10-20 cm/s, consistent with similar previous studies. Our findings
show that forward modeling the telluric lines effectively recovers the RV
precision and accuracy, with no prior knowledge of the PWV needed. Such a
recovery is less effective when the water absorption lines are relatively deep
in the stellar template used in the forward modeling. Overall, telluric
contamination plays an insignificant role for typical iodine-calibrated RV
programs aiming at ~1-2 m/s, but we recommend adding modeling of telluric lines
and taking stellar template observations on nights with low humidity for
programs aiming to achieve sub-m/s precision.

(VAE) framework. We investigate the posterior collapse problem of current
RNN-based VAEs for molecule sequence generation. For the first time, we find
that underestimated reconstruction loss leads to posterior collapse, and
provide both theoretical and experimental evidence. We propose an effective and
efficient solution to fix the problem and avoid posterior collapse. Without
bells and whistles, our method achieves SOTA reconstruction accuracy and
competitive validity on the ZINC 250K dataset. When generating 10,000 unique

networks, and transportation systems play a major role in the welfare of any
community. In the aftermath of disasters, their recovery is of paramount
importance; orderly and efficient recovery involves the assignment of limited
resources (a combination of human repair workers and machines) to repair
damaged infrastructure components. The decision maker must also deal with
uncertainty in the outcome of the resource-allocation actions during recovery.
The manual assignment of resources seldom is optimal despite the expertise of
the decision maker because of the large number of choices and uncertainties in
consequences of sequential decisions. This combinatorial assignment problem
under uncertainty is known to be \mbox{NP-hard}. We propose a novel decision
technique that addresses the massive number of decision choices for large-scale
real-world problems; in addition, our method also features an experiential
learning component that adaptively determines the utilization of the
computational resources based on the performance of a small number of choices.
Our framework is closed-loop, and naturally incorporates all the attractive
features of such a decision-making system. In contrast to myopic approaches,
which do not account for the future effects of the current choices, our
methodology has an anticipatory learning component that effectively
incorporates \emph{lookahead} into the solutions. To this end, we leverage the
theory of regression analysis, Markov decision processes (MDPs), multi-armed
bandits, and stochastic models of community damage from natural disasters to
develop a method for near-optimal recovery of communities. Our method
contributes to the general problem of MDPs with massive action spaces with
application to recovery of communities affected by hazards.

significantly accelerates the computation of convolution layers in a deep

convolution across multiple channels, NESTA, rather than computing the precise
result of a convolution per channel, quickly computes an approximation of its
partial sum, and a residual value such that if added to the approximate partial
sum, generates the accurate output. Then, instead of immediately adding the
residual, it uses (consumes) the residual when processing the next batch in the
hamming weight compressors with available capacity. This mechanism shortens the
critical path by avoiding the need to propagate carry signals during each round
of computation and speeds up the convolution of each channel. In the last stage
of computation, when the partial sum of the last channel is computed, NESTA

sets the new state of the art on various types of label noise and achieves
excellent performance on large-scale datasets with real-world label noise. For

labeled data per class, our method achieves $80.2{\pm}0.3\%$ classification

learned simultaneously. To handle heterogeneous relations in KGs, we introduce
a novel way of representing heterogeneous neighborhood by introducing
transformation assumptions on the relationship between the subject, the
relation, and the object of a triple. Specifically, a relation is treated as a
transformation operator transforming a head entity to a tail entity. Both
translation assumption in TransE and rotation assumption in RotatE are explored
in our framework. Additionally, instead of only learning entity embeddings in
the convolution-based encoder while learning relation embeddings in the decoder
as done by the state-of-art models, e.g., R-GCN, the TransGCN framework trains
relation embeddings and entity embeddings simultaneously during the graph
convolution operation, thus having fewer parameters compared with R-GCN.

Bell inequalities the maximal violation can be achieved in an essentially
unique manner. In this work we present a family of Bell inequalities which are
maximally violated by multiple inequivalent quantum realisations. We completely
characterise the quantum realisations achieving the maximal violation and we
show that each of them requires a maximally entangled state of two qubits. This
implies the existence of a new, weak form of self-testing in which the maximal
violation allows us to identify the state, but does not fully determine the
measurements. From the geometric point of view the set of probability points
that saturate the quantum bound is a line segment. We then focus on a
particular member of the family and show that the self-testing statement is
robust, i.e. that observing a non-maximal violation allows us to make a
quantitative statement about the unknown state. To achieve this we present a
new construction of extraction channels and analyse their performance. For
completeness we provide two independent approaches: analytical and numerical.
The noise robustness, i.e. the amount of white noise at which the bound becomes
trivial, of the analytical bound is rather small (~0.06%), but the numerical
method takes us into an experimentally-relevant regime (~5%). We conclude by
investigating the amount of randomness that can be certified using these Bell
violations. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that the qualitative behaviour
resembles the behaviour of rigid inequalities like the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality. This shows that at least for some
device-independent applications rigidity is not a necessary ingredient.

emission toward the Orion Bar, which is an interface between the ionized region
around the Orion Trapezium stars and the Orion molecular cloud. We aim to
understand the origin of HF emission in the Orion Bar by comparing its spatial
distribution with other tracers. We examine three mechanisms to explain the HF
emission: thermal excitation, radiative dust pumping, and chemical pumping. We
used a Herschel/HIFI strip map of the HF J = 1-0 line, covering 0.5' by 1.5'
that is oriented perpendicular to the Orion Bar. We used the RADEX non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) code to construct the HF column density
map. We use the Meudon PDR code to explain the morphology of HF. The bulk of
the HF emission at 10 km s^-1 emerges from the CO-dark molecular gas that
separates the ionization front from the molecular gas that is deeper in the
Orion Bar. The excitation of HF is caused mainly by collisions with H2 at a
density of 10^5 cm^-3 together with a small contribution of electrons in the
interclump gas of the Orion Bar. Infrared pumping and chemical pumping are not
important. We conclude that the HF J = 1-0 line traces CO-dark molecular gas.
Similarly, bright photodissociation regions associated with massive star
formation may be responsible for the HF emission observed toward active
galactic nuclei.

environment is doomed to decohere. The preservation of quantum coherence is one
of the major challenges faced in quantum technologies, but its use as a
resource is very promising and can lead to various operational advantages, for
example in quantum algorithms. Hence, much work has been devoted in recent
years to quantify the coherence present in a system. In the present paper, we
formulate the quantum resource theory of dynamical coherence. The underlying
physical principle we follow is that the free dynamical objects are those that
cannot preserve or distribute coherence. This leads us to identify classical
channels as the free elements in this theory. Consequently, even the quantum
identity channel is not free as all physical systems undergo decoherence and
hence, the preservation of coherence should be considered a resource. In our
work, we introduce four different types of free superchannels (analogous to
MIO, DIO, IO, and SIO) and discuss in detail two of them, namely,
dephasing-covariant incoherent superchannels (DISC), maximally incoherent
superchannels (MISC). The latter consists of all superchannels that do not
generate non-classical channels from classical ones. We quantify dynamical
coherence using channel-divergence-based monotones for MISC and DISC. We show
that some of these monotones have operational interpretations as the exact, the
approximate, and the liberal coherence cost of a quantum channel. Moreover, we
prove that the liberal asymptotic cost of a channel is equal to a new type of
regularized relative entropy. Finally, we show that the conversion distance
between two channels under MISC and DISC can be computed using a semi-definite
program (SDP).

two additional sources of information (i.e., context) over time, gaze, movement

the action anticipation performance. We address action anticipation as a
classification task, where the model takes the available information as the
input and predicts the most likely action. We propose to use the uncertainty
about each prediction as an online decision-making criterion for action
anticipation. Uncertainty is modeled as a stochastic process applied to a
time-based neural network architecture, which improves the conventional

which led to exploration of applying self-attention to speech problems as well.
The efficacy of self-attention in speech applications, however, seems not fully
blown yet since it is challenging to handle highly correlated speech frames in
the context of self-attention. In this paper we propose a new neural network
model architecture, namely multi-stream self-attention, to address the issue
thus make the self-attention mechanism more effective for speech recognition.
The proposed model architecture consists of parallel streams of self-attention
encoders, and each stream has layers of 1D convolutions with dilated kernels
whose dilation rates are unique given stream, followed by a self-attention
layer. The self-attention mechanism in each stream pays attention to only one
resolution of input speech frames and the attentive computation can be more
efficient. In a later stage, outputs from all the streams are concatenated then
linearly projected to the final embedding. By stacking the proposed

grails of nanotechnology. The most promising class of techniques that enable
deterministic nanodevice fabrication are based on scanning probe patterning or
surface assembly. However, this typically involves a complex process flow,
stringent requirements for an ultra high vacuum environment, long fabrication
times and, consequently, limited throughput and device yield. Here, a device
platform is developed that overcomes these limitations by integrating scanning
probe based dopant device fabrication with a CMOS-compatible process flow.
Silicon on insulator substrates are used featuring a reconstructed Si(001):H
surface that is protected by a capping chip and has pre-implanted contacts
ready for scanning tunneling microscope (STM) patterning. Processing in
ultra-high vacuum is thus reduced to only a few critical steps which minimizes
the complexity, time and effort required for fabrication of the nanoscale
dopant devices. Subsequent reintegration of the samples into the CMOS process
flow not only simplifies the post-processing but also opens the door to
successful application of STM based dopant devices as a building block in more
complex device architectures. Full functionality of this approach is
demonstrated with magnetotransport measurements on degenerately doped STM
patterned Si:P nanowires up to room temperature.

challenge in crowd simulation is to imitate the movement of expert agents in
highly dense crowds. An imitation model could substitute an expert agent if the
model behaves as good as the expert. This will bring many exciting
applications. However, we believe no prior studies have considered the critical
question of how training data and training methods affect imitators when these
models are applied to novel scenarios. In this work, a general imitation model
is represented by applying either the Behavior Cloning (BC) training method or
a more sophisticated Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) method,
on three typical types of data domains: standard benchmarks for evaluating
crowd models, random sampling of state-action pairs, and egocentric scenarios
that capture local interactions. Simulated results suggest that (i) simpler
training methods are overall better than more complex training methods, (ii)
training samples with diverse agent-agent and agent-obstacle interactions are
beneficial for reducing collisions when the trained models are applied to new
scenarios. We additionally evaluated our models in their ability to imitate

web-browser-based Linux desktop sessions with standard robotics software like
Gazebo, ROS, and flight autonomy stack. Second, a method for saving an
individual's research work with its dependencies for the work's future

photorealistic robotics simulations by combining Unity game engine-based camera
rendering and Gazebo physics. The paper addresses a research need for
photorealistic simulations and describes a methodology for creating a

a promising opportunity to build large-scale systems to connect numerous

Blockchain technology provides many desired features for large-scale IIoT

technology to the IIoT infrastructure, the required storage space posts a grant
challenge to resource-constrained IIoT infrastructures. To address the storage
issue, this paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain storage structure,
\textit{ChainSplitter}. Specially, the proposed architecture features a
hierarchical storage structure where the majority of the blockchain is stored
in the clouds, while the most recent blocks are stored in the overlay network
of the individual IIoT networks. The proposed architecture seamlessly binds
local IIoT networks, the blockchain overlay network, and the cloud
infrastructure together through two connectors, the \textit{blockchain
connector} and the \textit{cloud connector}, to construct the hierarchical
blockchain storage. The blockchain connector in the overlay network builds
blocks in blockchain from data generated in IIoT networks, and the cloud
connector resolves the blockchain synchronization issues between the overlay
network and the clouds. We also provide a case study to show the efficiency of
the proposed hierarchical blockchain storage in a practical Industrial IoT

fractions should be considered in an Euler-Lagrange, two-way coupling model.
This leads to zero-Mach number, variable density governing equations. Using
pressure-based solvers, this gives rise to a source term in the pressure
Poisson equation and a non-divergence free velocity field. To test the validity
and predictive capability of such an approach, a round jet laden with particles
is investigated using Direct Numerical Simulation coupled with point-Particle

addition, volume displacement effects due to the presence of solid particles or
liquid droplets, which is commonly neglected in the standard two-way coupling,
are taken into account in both continuity and inter-phase momentum transfer to
accurately capture the underlying structure of particle-turbulence
interactions. Prediction results are in well agreement with the corresponding

condition on $\gamma_0$, we are able to provide a functional central limit
theorem. These results complement recent studies on the spatial average for

empirical literature, which suggests that voters are susceptible to different
biases -- reputation (e.g., of the poster), social influence (e.g., votes thus
far), and position (e.g., answer position). Our goal is to quantify, in an
observational setting, the degree of these biases in online platforms.
Specifically, what are the causal effects of different impression signals --
such as the reputation of the contributing user, aggregate vote thus far, and
position of content -- on a participant's vote on content? We adopt an
instrumental variable (IV) framework to answer this question. We identify a set
of candidate instruments, carefully analyze their validity, and then use the
valid instruments to reveal the effects of the impression signals on votes. Our
empirical study using log data from Stack Exchange websites shows that the bias
estimates from our IV approach differ from the bias estimates from the ordinary
least squares (OLS) method. In particular, OLS underestimates reputation bias
(1.6--2.2x for gold badges) and position bias (up to 1.9x for the initial
position) and overestimates social influence bias (1.8--2.3x for initial

equations (PDEs). In computer-assisted proofs of PDEs, the original problem is
transformed into the infinite Newton-type fixed point equation $w = - {\mathcal
L}^{-1} {\mathcal F}(\hat{u}) + {\mathcal L}^{-1} {\mathcal G}(w)$, where
${\mathcal L}$ is a linearized operator, ${\mathcal F}(\hat{u})$ is a residual,
and ${\mathcal G}(w)$ is a local Lipschitz term. Therefore, the estimations of
$\| {\mathcal L}^{-1} {\mathcal F}(\hat{u}) \|$ and $\| {\mathcal
L}^{-1}{\mathcal G}(w) \|$ play major roles in the verification procedures. In
this paper, using a similar concept as the `Schur complement' for matrix
problems, we represent the inverse operator ${\mathcal L}^{-1}$ as an
infinite-dimensional operator matrix that can be decomposed into two parts, one
finite dimensional and one infinite dimensional. This operator matrix yields a
new effective realization of the infinite-dimensional Newton method, enabling a
more efficient verification procedure compared with existing methods for the
solution of elliptic PDEs. We present some numerical examples that confirm the
usefulness of the proposed method. Related results obtained from the
representation of the operator matrix as ${\mathcal L}^{-1}$ are presented in
the appendix.

graphs, called Graph Recurrent Attention Networks (GRANs). Our model generates
graphs one block of nodes and associated edges at a time. The block size and
sampling stride allow us to trade off sample quality for efficiency. Compared
to previous RNN-based graph generative models, our framework better captures
the auto-regressive conditioning between the already-generated and
to-be-generated parts of the graph using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with
attention. This not only reduces the dependency on node ordering but also
bypasses the long-term bottleneck caused by the sequential nature of RNNs.
Moreover, we parameterize the output distribution per block using a mixture of
Bernoulli, which captures the correlations among generated edges within the
block. Finally, we propose to handle node orderings in generation by
marginalizing over a family of canonical orderings. On standard benchmarks, we
achieve state-of-the-art time efficiency and sample quality compared to
previous models. Additionally, we show our model is capable of generating large
graphs of up to 5K nodes with good quality. To the best of our knowledge, GRAN
is the first deep graph generative model that can scale to this size. Our code

To demonstrate and evaluate robot capabilities, sub-tasks highlight different

suspected IED, and securing the IED in a total containment vessel (TCV). For
each sub-task, a description of the technical approach and the hidden

further work is needed on user interfaces for increasing task completion

update parameters, or to skip immediately to the next example. By reducing the

Selective-Backprop accelerates training. Evaluation on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and

behavior of DNNs' test performance. To this end, we introduce a new metric
called NN-Mass to quantify how effectively information flows through DNNs.
Moreover, we empirically show that NN-Mass also works for other types of skip

contain addition-type skip connections (i.e., residuals or inverted residuals).
As such, for both DenseNet-like CNNs and ResNets/WRNs/MobileNets, our

despite having significantly different size/compute requirements. Detailed
experiments on both synthetic and real datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10,

with noise (LPN), is an example of intelligent behavior that aims to generalize
a concept based on noisy examples. The solution to LPN immediately leads to
decoding a random binary linear code in the presence of classification noise.
This problem is thought to be intractable classically, but can be solved
efficiently if a quantum oracle can be queried. However, in practice, a learner
is more likely to receive data from classical oracles. In this work, we show
that a naive application of the quantum LPN algorithm to classical data encoded
in an equal superposition state requires an exponential sample complexity. We
then propose a quantum-classical reinforcement learning algorithm to solve the
LPN problem for data generated by a classical oracle and demonstrate a
significant reduction in the sample complexity. Simulations with a hidden bit
string of length up to 12 show that the quantum-classical reinforcement
learning performs better than known classical algorithms when the sample
complexity, run time, and robustness to classical noise are collectively
considered. Our algorithm is robust to any noise in the quantum circuit that
effectively appears as Pauli errors on the final state.

permissiveness (that is, room for constraint feasibility) of the planner, while
maintaining safety after accounting for the tracking error bound. We achieve
this by parametrizing the state and input constraints imposed on the planner
and deriving corresponding parametrized tracking control laws and tracking
error bounds, which are computed offline through Sum-of-Squares programming.
The parameters are then optimally chosen to maximize planner permissiveness,

different variants of clustering problems such as $k$-median and $k$-means
problems. However, despite the importance of the context, the current
understanding of balanced clustering (or more generally capacitated clustering)
in the streaming setting is very limited. The only previously known streaming
approximation algorithm for capacitated clustering requires three passes and
only handles insertions.
  In this work, we develop \emph{the first single pass streaming algorithm} for
a general class of clustering problems that includes capacitated $k$-median and
capacitated $k$-means in Euclidean space, using only poly$( k d \log \Delta)$
space, where $k$ is the number of clusters, $d$ is the dimension and $\Delta$
is the maximum relative range of a coordinate. (Note that $d\log \Delta$ is the
space required to represent one point.) This algorithm only violates the
capacity constraint by a $1+\epsilon$ factor. Interestingly, unlike the
previous algorithm, our algorithm handles both insertions and deletions of
points. To provide this result we define a decomposition of the space via some
curved half-spaces. We used this decomposition to design a strong coreset of
size poly$( k d \log \Delta)$ for balanced clustering. Then, we show that this
coreset is implementable in the streaming and distributed settings.

separate the contributions of the fibril's viscoelastic response and the

collections of Euclidean discs in the complex plane with the following
property: The set of angles $\theta$ for which the ray $\arg(z)=\theta$ meets
infinitely many discs in a given $\mathcal{E}$-set has linear measure zero. An
important special case of an $\mathcal{E}$-set is known as the $R$-set. These
sets appear in numerous papers in the theories of complex differential and

$\mathcal{E}$-sets to $R$-sets, and then to much thinner sets. In addition to
rays, plane curves that originate from the zero distribution theory of
exponential polynomials will be considered. It turns out that almost every such
curve meets at most finitely many discs in the collection in question.
Analogous discussions are provided in the case of the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$,
where the curves tend to the boundary $\partial\mathbb{D}$ tangentially or
non-tangentially. Finally, these findings will be used for improving well-known

polynomial in $n$ on quantum devices that are capable of performing
error-correction. However, today's quantum devices are inherently noisy, too
limited for error correction, and Simon's algorithm is not error-tolerant.
  We show that even noisy quantum period finding computations may lead to
speedups in comparison to purely classical computations. To this end, we
implemented Simon's quantum period finding circuit on the $15$-qubit quantum
device IBM Q 16 Melbourne. Our experiments show that with a certain probability
$\tau(n)$ we measure erroneous vectors that are not orthogonal to $\vec s$. We
propose new, simple, but very effective smoothing techniques to classically
mitigate physical noise effects such as e.g. IBM Q's bias towards the
$0$-qubit.
  After smoothing, our noisy quantum device provides us a statistical
distribution that we can easily transform into an LPN instance with parameters
$n$ and $\tau(n)$. Hence, in the noisy case we may not hope to find periods in
time polynomial in $n$. However, we may still obtain a quantum advantage if the
error $\tau(n)$ does not grow too large. This demonstrates that quantum devices
may be useful for period finding, even before achieving the level of full error
correction capability.

quintessential question in nonlinear control theory. While previous work has

dynamics throughout the state space. In contrast to such classical methods,
this paper considers the question of estimating the reachable set of a control
system using only the knowledge of local system dynamics at a single point and
a bound on the rate of change of dynamics. Namely, motivated by the need for
safety-critical planning for systems with unknown dynamics, we consider the
problem of describing the guaranteed reachability set: the set of all states
that are guaranteed to be reachable regardless of the true system dynamics,
given the current knowledge about the system. We show that such a set can be
underapproximated by a reachable set of a related known system whose dynamics
at every state depend on the velocity vectors that are guaranteed to all
control systems consistent with the assumed knowledge. Complementing the
theory, numerical examples of a single-dimensional control system and a simple
model of an aircraft in distress verify that such an underapproximation is
meaningful in practice, and may indeed equal the desired guaranteed
reachability set.

it is possible to trace this growth history using the properties of a galaxy's

that outside a radius of 25 kpc the population of halo globular clusters is
rotating in alignment with the stellar disk, as are more centrally located
clusters. The M31 halo also contains coherent stellar substructures, along with
a smoothly distributed stellar component. Many of the globular clusters outside

associated with the smooth halo is aligned with the rotation axis for the plane
of dwarf galaxies that encircles M31. We interpret these separate cluster
populations as arising from two major accretion epochs, likely separated by

this problem or quasi-cyclic versions of it have been proposed recently, such
as those in the submissions ROLLO and RQC currently at the second round of the
NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process. While combinatorial
attacks on this problem have been extensively studied and seem now well
understood, the situation is not as satisfactory for algebraic attacks, for
which previous work essentially suggested that they were ineffective for
cryptographic parameters. In this paper, starting from Ourivski and Johansson's
algebraic modelling of the problem into a system of polynomial equations, we
show how to augment this system with easily computed equations so that the
augmented system is solved much faster via Groebner bases. This happens because
the augmented system has solving degree $r$, $r+1$ or $r+2$ depending on the
parameters, where $r$ is the rank weight, which we show by extending results
from Verbel et al. (PQCrypto 2019) on systems arising from the MinRank problem;
with target rank $r$, Verbel et al. lower the solving degree to $r+2$, and even
less for some favorable instances that they call superdetermined. We give
complexity bounds for this approach as well as practical timings of an
implementation using Magma. This improves upon the previously known complexity
estimates for both Groebner basis and (non-quantum) combinatorial approaches,
and for example leads to an attack in 200 bits on ROLLO-I-256 whose claimed

show that a deep extended solar activity minimum is expected during 2019 -
2021, and that the next solar maximum will occur in 2024 - 2025. The sunspot
number at the maximum will be about 50 with an error estimate of 15 - 30 %. The
maximum will likely have a double peak or show extended periods (for 2 - 2.5
years) of high activity. According to the hemispheric prediction results, SC25

delayed for about 1 year (with an error of $\pm 0.5$ year), and reach a maximum

reduction technique for nonnegative data. NMF requires that each data point is
approximated by a convex combination of basis elements. Archetypal analysis
(AA), also referred to as convex NMF, is a well-known NMF variant imposing that
the basis elements are themselves convex combinations of the data points. AA
has the advantage to be more interpretable than NMF because the basis elements
are directly constructed from the data points. However, it usually suffers from
a high data fitting error because the basis elements are constrained to be
contained in the convex cone of the data points. In this letter, we introduce
near-convex archetypal analysis (NCAA) which combines the advantages of both AA
and NMF. As for AA, the basis vectors are required to be linear combinations of
the data points and hence are easily interpretable. As for NMF, the additional
flexibility in choosing the basis elements allows NCAA to have a low data
fitting error. We show that NCAA compares favorably with a state-of-the-art
minimum-volume NMF method on synthetic datasets and on a real-world

the ultimate sensitivity is achievable by using an entangled symmetric Gaussian

beam-splitter network, and homodyne detection on each output mode in the
absence of photon loss. Interestingly, the maximal entanglement of a symmetric
Gaussian state is not optimal although the presence of entanglement is
advantageous as compared to the case using a product symmetric Gaussian state.
It is also demonstrated that when loss occurs, homodyne detection and other
types of Gaussian measurements compete for better sensitivity, depending on the
amount of loss and properties of a probe state. None of them provide the
ultimate sensitivity, indicating that non-Gaussian measurements are required
for optimality in lossy cases. Our general results obtained through a

the SetIntersection variant, all the elements in the intersection of the query

considered in several papers from both the upper bound and lower bound
perspective.
  Several conditional lower bounds for these problems were proven for the
tradeoff between preprocessing and query time or the tradeoff between space and
query time. Moreover, there are several unconditional hardness results for
these problems in some specific computational models. The fundamental nature of
the SetDisjointness and SetIntersection problems makes them useful for proving
the conditional hardness of other problems from various areas. However, the
universe of the elements in the sets may be very large, which may cause the
reduction to some other problems to be inefficient and therefore it is not
useful for proving their conditional hardness.
  In this paper, we prove the conditional hardness of SetDisjointness and
SetIntersection with bounded universe. This conditional hardness is shown for
both the interplay between preprocessing and query time and the interplay
between space and query time. Moreover, we present several applications of
these new conditional lower bounds. These applications demonstrates the
strength of our new conditional lower bounds as they exploit the limited

We present a comprehensive theoretical study of crowding effects on
thermodynamic, structural, and dynamic properties of weakly cross-linked ionic
microgels in a good solvent. The microgels are modeled as microion- and
solvent-permeable colloidal spheres with fixed charge uniformly distributed
over the polymer gel backbone, whose elastic and solvent-interaction free
energies are described using Flory-Rehner theory. Two mean-field methods for
calculating the crowding-dependent microgel radius are investigated, and
combined with calculations of the net microgel charge characterizing the
electrostatic part of an effective microgel pair potential, with charge
renormalization accounted for. Using this effective pair potential,
thermodynamic and static suspension properties are calculated including the
osmotic pressure and microgel pair distribution function. The latter is used in
our calculations of dynamic suspension properties, where we account for
hydrodynamic interactions. Results for diffusion and rheological properties are
presented over ranges of microgel concentration and charge. We show that
deswelling mildly enhances self- and collective diffusion and the osmotic
pressure, lowers the suspension viscosity, and significantly shifts the
suspension crystallization point to higher concentrations. The paper presents a
bottom-up approach to efficiently computing suspension properties of crowded
ionic microgels using single-particle characteristics.

This combination enabled to transform a conventional quasi-periodic Raman comb
into a comb with a single and smaller frequency spacing. This new phenomenon is
realized using a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber filled with 40 bars of
deuterium, and pumped with a high-power picosecond laser. The resultant comb
shows more than 100 spectral lines spanning over 220 THz from 800 nm to 1710
nm, with a total output power of 7.1 W. In contrast to a pure Raman comb, a 120
THz wide portion of the spectrum exhibits denser and equally-spaced spectral
lines with a frequency spacing of around 1.75 THz, which is much smaller than
the lowest frequency of the three excited deuterium Raman resonances. A
numerical solution of the generalized nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation in the
slowly varying envelope approximation provides very good agreement with the

smooth problems with high accuracy thanks to their exponential convergence to
the true solution. When applied to discontinuous problems, such as fluid shocks
and material interfaces, due to the Gibbs phenomenon, pseudospectral solutions
lose their superb convergence and suffer from spurious oscillations across the
entire computational domain. Luckily, there exist theoretical remedies for
these issues which have been successfully tested in practice for cases of well
defined discontinuities. We focus on one piece of this procedure---detecting a
discontinuity in spectral data. We show that realistic applications require
treatment of discontinuities dynamically developing in time and that it poses
challenges associated with shock detection. More precisely, smoothly steepening
gradients in the solution spawn spurious oscillations due to insufficient
resolution, causing premature shock identification and information loss. We
improve existing spectral shock detection techniques to allow us to
automatically detect true discontinuities and identify cases for which
post-processing is required to suppress spurious oscillations resulting from
the loss of resolution. We then apply these techniques to solve an inviscid
Burgers' equation in 1D, demonstrating that our method correctly treats genuine
shocks caused by wave breaking and removes oscillations caused by numerical

  The conflict-free coloring problem is NP-complete. From results in Abel et.
al. [SODA 2017], it can be inferred that every planar graph has a conflict-free
coloring with at most nine colors. As the best known lower bound for planar
graphs is four colors, it was asked in the same paper if fewer colors would
suffice. We make progress in answering this question, by showing that every
planar graph can be colored using at most six colors. The same proof idea is
used to show that every outerplanar graph can be colored using at most five
colors. Using a different approach, we further show that every outerplanar
graph can be colored using at most four colors.
  Finally, we study the problem on Kneser graphs. We show that $k+2$ colors are

notable levels of skill at predicting the average winter North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO) when initialised one month ahead. At the same time, these
model predictions exhibit unusually low signal-to-noise ratios, in what has
been dubbed a `signal-to-noise paradox'. We analyse both the skill and
signal-to-noise ratio of the Integrated Forecast System (IFS), the European
Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model, in an ensemble
hindcast experiment. Specifically, we examine the contribution to both from the
regime dynamics of the North Atlantic eddy-driven jet. This is done by
constructing a statistical model which captures the predictability inherent to
to the trimodal jet latitude system, and fitting its parameters to reanalysis
and IFS data. Predictability in this regime system is driven by interannual
variations in the persistence of the jet latitude regimes, which determine the
preferred state of the jet. We show that the IFS has skill at predicting such
variations in persistence: because the position of the jet strongly influences
the NAO, this automatically generates skill at predicting the NAO. We show that
all of the skill the IFS has at predicting the winter NAO over the period
1980-2010 can be attributed to its skill at predicting regime persistence in
this way. Similarly, the tendency of the IFS to underestimate regime
persistence can account for the low signal-to-noise ratio, giving a possible
explanation for the signal-to-noise paradox. Finally, we examine how external
forcing drives variability in jet persistence, as well as highlight the role
played by transient baroclinic eddy feedbacks to modulate regime persistence.

Motivated by the success of advice complexity in the area of online algorithms,
the fixed priority model was extended to include advice, and a reduction-based

required to achieve certain approximation ratios in this rather powerful model.
To capture most of the algorithms that are considered greedy-like, the even
stronger model of adaptive priority algorithms is needed. We extend the
adaptive priority model to include advice. We modify the reduction-based
framework from the fixed priority case to work with the more powerful adaptive
priority algorithms, simplifying the proof of correctness and strengthening all
previous lower bounds by a factor of two in the process.
  We also present a purely combinatorial adaptive priority algorithm with
advice for Minimum Vertex Cover on triangle-free graphs of maximum degree
three. Our algorithm achieves optimality and uses at most 7n/22 bits of advice.
No adaptive priority algorithm without advice can achieve optimality without
advice, and we prove that an online algorithm with advice needs more than 7n/22
bits of advice to reach optimality.
  We show connections between exact algorithms and priority algorithms with
advice. The branching in branch-and-reduce algorithms can be seen as trying all
possible advice strings, and all priority algorithms with advice that achieve
optimality define corresponding exact algorithms, priority exact algorithms.
Lower bounds on advice-based adaptive algorithms imply lower bounds on running

$\gamma^1,...,\gamma^\alpha\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ we consider the problem of
finding an elastic \emph{connected} compact surface $M$ with boundary
$\gamma=\gamma^1\cup...\cup\gamma^\alpha$. This is realized by minimizing the
Willmore energy $\mathcal{W}$ on a suitable class of competitors. While the
direct minimization of the Area functional may lead to limits that are
disconnected, we prove that, if the infimum of the problem is $<4\pi$, there
exists a connected compact minimizer of $\mathcal{W}$ in the class of integer
rectifiable curvature varifolds with the assigned boundary conditions. This is
done by proving that varifold convergence of bounded varifolds with boundary
with uniformly bounded Willmore energy implies the convergence of their
supports in Hausdorff distance. Hence, in the cases in which a small
perturbation of the boundary conditions causes the non-existence of
Area-minimizing connected surfaces, our minimization process models the
existence of optimal elastic connected compact generalized surfaces with such
boundary data. We also study the asymptotic regime in which the diameter of the
optimal connected surfaces is arbitrarily large. Under suitable boundedness
assumptions, we show that rescalings of such surfaces converge to round
spheres. The study of both the perturbative and the asymptotic regime is
motivated by the remarkable case of elastic surfaces connecting two parallel
circles located at any possible distance one from the other. The main tool we
use is the monotonicity formula for curvature varifolds, that we extend to
varifolds with boundary, together with its consequences on the structure of

reduced to a set of eight evolution equations for eight harmonic coefficients,
representing perturbations in density, shear, vorticity and the Weyl tensor, in
terms of which all other variables can be expressed algebraically. This system
decouples into two sub-systems, one for five and one for three coefficients. As
previously known, vorticity perturbations cannot be generated to any order in a
barytopic perfect fluid. Hence the time development of existing first order

However, an already existing vorticity will act as source terms in the

At the level of dynamic cellular communication, however, it remains unknown
what effect, if any, arises from communication beyond the mean field level.
What are the limits and benefits to communication across a network of neighbor

energy-resolved measurements allow the generation of material-specific images
by exploiting differences in the energy-dependent attenuation. Differential
phase-contrast imaging uses the phase shift that an X-ray wave exhibits when
traversing an object as contrast generation mechanism. Recently, we have
investigated the combination of these two imaging techniques (spectral
differential phase-contrast imaging) and demonstrated potential advantages
compared with spectral imaging. In this work, we present a noise analysis
framework that allows the prediction of (co-) variances and noise power spectra

strongly reduced noise levels compared with the other two imaging methods for a
large range of clinically relevant pixel sizes. In contrast to conventional
differential phase-contrast imaging, there are no long-range noise correlations

another by counting the minimum number of character insertions, deletions, and
substitutions required to transform one string into the other. A simple dynamic
programming computes the edit distance between two strings of length $n$ in
$O(n^2)$ time, and a more sophisticated algorithm runs in time $O(n+t^2)$ when
the edit distance is $t$ [Landau, Myers and Schmidt, SICOMP 1998]. In pursuit
of obtaining faster running time, the last couple of decades have seen a flurry
of research on approximating edit distance, including polylogarithmic
approximation in near-linear time [Andoni, Krauthgamer and Onak, FOCS 2010],
and a constant-factor approximation in subquadratic time [Chakrabarty, Das,
Goldenberg, Kouck\'y and Saks, FOCS 2018].
  We study sublinear-time algorithms for small edit distance, which was
investigated extensively because of its numerous applications. Our main result
is an algorithm for distinguishing whether the edit distance is at most $t$ or
at least $t^2$ (the quadratic gap problem) in time
$\tilde{O}(\frac{n}{t}+t^3)$. This time bound is sublinear roughly for all $t$
in $[\omega(1), o(n^{1/3})]$, which was not known before. The best previous
algorithms solve this problem in sublinear time only for $t=\omega(n^{1/3})$
[Andoni and Onak, STOC 2009].
  Our algorithm is based on a new approach that adaptively switches between
uniform sampling and reading contiguous blocks of the input strings. In
contrast, all previous algorithms choose which coordinates to query
non-adaptively. Moreover, it can be extended to solve the $t$ vs
$t^{2-\epsilon}$ gap problem in time $\tilde{O}(\frac{n}{t^{1-\epsilon}}+t^3)$.

common approaches for establishing non-interference: type systems and program

they are inherently restrictive in the kind of programs they support. Program
logics support challenging programs, but they typically require significant
human assistance, and cannot handle modules or higher-order programs.
  To connect these two approaches, we present SeLoC---a separation logic for
non-interference, on top of which we build a type system using the technique of
logical relations. By building a type system on top of separation logic, we can
compositionally verify programs that consist of typed and untyped parts. The
former parts are verified through type checking, while the latter parts are
verified through manual proof.
  The core technical contribution of SeLoC is a relational form of weakest
preconditions that can track information flow using separation logic resources.
SeLoC is fully machine-checked, and built on top of the Iris framework for
concurrent separation logic in Coq. The integration with Iris provides seamless
support for fine-grained concurrency, which was beyond the reach of prior type

that takes into account both long-range and short-range interactions.
Short-range interaction is expressed in terms of mean potentials and long-range
interaction is considered in terms of screening potentials. A system of
integral equations for these potentials is constructed based on the condition
of the best agreement of the system of study with the reference system. In
contrast to the description of media with short-range interactions, in this
text the reference distribution includes not only the field of mean potentials
but also Coulomb interaction between particles. A one-component system made of
ions in a neutralizing background of fixed counterions is considered. The model
can be used to describe solid ionic conductors. In order to study the movement
of cations on the sites of their sub-lattice, the lattice approximation of the
theory is employed based on the calculation of the pair distribution function.
Using the collective variables approach, a technique improving the starting
expression for this function is proposed. Notably, the neglected terms in the
expansion of this function are approximated by single-particle terms ensuring
that the normalization condition is satisfied. As a result, the applicability
of the theory is extended to a wide region of thermodynamic parameters. The
chemical potential and the diffusion coefficient are calculated showing the
possibility of phase transitions characteristic of the system.

thigh, and shank kinematics during walking using only three wearable inertial
sensors. Methods: The algorithm makes novel use of a constrained Kalman filter
(CKF). The algorithm iterates through the prediction (kinematic equation),
measurement (pelvis position pseudo-measurements, zero velocity update,
flat-floor assumption, and covariance limiter), and constraint update
(formulation of hinged knee joints and ball-and-socket hip joints). Results:
Evaluation of the algorithm using an optical motion capture-based
sensor-to-segment calibration on nine participants ($7$ men and $2$ women,
weight $63.0 \pm 6.8$ kg, height $1.70 \pm 0.06$ m, age $24.6 \pm 3.9$ years
old), with no known gait or lower body biomechanical abnormalities, who walked
within a $4 \times 4$ m$^2$ capture area shows that it can track motion
relative to the mid-pelvis origin with mean position and orientation (no bias)
root-mean-square error (RMSE) of $5.21 \pm 1.3$ cm and $16.1 \pm 3.2^\circ$,
respectively. The sagittal knee and hip joint angle RMSEs (no bias) were $10.0

correlation coefficient (CC) values were $0.87 \pm 0.08$ and $0.74 \pm 0.12$.
Conclusion: The CKF-based algorithm was able to track the 3D pose of the
pelvis, thigh, and shanks using only three inertial sensors worn on the pelvis
and shanks. Significance: Due to the Kalman-filter-based algorithm's low
computation cost and the relative convenience of using only three wearable
sensors, gait parameters can be computed in real-time and remotely for
long-term gait monitoring. Furthermore, the system can be used to inform
real-time gait assistive devices.

Moreover, we consider unreliable workers, whose processing speeds are

the feasibility-optimal scheduling algorithm suffers from high computational

recognition, especially on large-scale datasets like Kinetics [1]. Therefore,
training scalability is essential to handle a large amount of videos. In this
paper, we study the factors that impact the training scalability of video
networks. We recognize three bottlenecks, including data loading (data movement
from disk to GPU), communication (data movement over networking), and
computation FLOPs. We propose three design guidelines to improve the
scalability: (1) fewer FLOPs and hardware-friendly operator to increase the
computation efficiency; (2) fewer input frames to reduce the data movement and
increase the data loading efficiency; (3) smaller model size to reduce the
networking traffic and increase the networking efficiency. With these
guidelines, we designed a new operator Temporal Shift Module (TSM) that is
efficient and scalable for distributed training. TSM model can achieve 1.8x
higher throughput compared to previous I3D models. We scale up the training of
the TSM model to 1,536 GPUs, with a mini-batch of 12,288 video clips/98,304

spatial details (e.g., small bjects and fine boundary information) of
segmentation results will be lost. To address this problem, motivated by a
variational approach to image segmentation (i.e., level set theory), we propose
a novel loss function called the level set loss which is designed to refine
spatial details of segmentation results. To deal with multiple classes in an
image, we first decompose the ground truth into binary images. Note that each
binary image consists of background and regions belonging to a class. Then we
convert level set functions into class probability maps and calculate the
energy for each class. The network is trained to minimize the weighted sum of
the level set loss and the cross-entropy loss. The proposed level set loss
improves the spatial details of segmentation results in a time and memory
efficient way. Furthermore, our experimental results show that the proposed
loss function achieves better performance than previous approaches.

(CTA) will provide order-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity with respect
to the present generation of ground-based $\gamma$-ray observatories, opening
new frontiers for high-energy studies of radio galaxies. In a previous paper,
we studied the CTA detection prospects of misaligned jets from the Third
Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL) sample. In this work, we take advantage of the
expanded sample from the Fourth Fermi-LAT catalog (4FGL), including roughly
double the number of sources. We simulate CTA observations of 41 $\gamma$-ray
radio galaxies, extrapolating their GeV spectrum into the TeV range assuming
different spectral shapes. We predict that the CTA will detect eleven new TeV
radio galaxies with an observational campaign of 50 hours per source, under the
realistic assumption of a spectral cutoff at 0.5 TeV. This would increase the
sample of VHE radio galaxies by a factor of three, and result in the first
detection of FR II radio galaxies at these energies. By simulating CTA
observations with 5 hours exposure, we predict that two Fermi-LAT radio
galaxies should already be within reach of current TeV observatories. Finally
we have investigated the prospects for a CTA detection of extended VHE emission
from the lobe-dominated FR I Fornax A, and predict that this will be possible
for integration times $\gtrsim\!50$ hours. We conclude that the CTA will
significantly impact our understanding of misaligned jets at TeV energies,

clamping restricts the formation of distinct ordering patterns in epitaxial

a thermally driven reversible transition in
La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$CoO$_{3-\delta}$ films on SrTiO$_3$ from a multidomain
brownmillerite (BM) structure to a uniform phase wherein oxygen vacancies order
in every third CoO$_x$ plane. Because temperature cycling is performed over a
limited temperature range (25 {\deg}C - 385 {\deg}C), the oxygen deficiency
parameter $\delta$ does not vary measurably. Under constant $\delta$, the
topotactic transition proceeds via local reordering of oxygen vacancies driven
by thermal strain. Atomic-resolution imaging reveals a two-step process whereby
alternating vertically and horizontally oriented BM domains first scale in size
to accommodate the strain induced by different thermal expansions of
La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$CoO$_{3-\delta}$ and SrTiO$_3$, before the new phase
nucleates and quickly grows above 360 {\deg}C. Upon cooling, the film transform
back to the mixed BM phase. As the structural transition is fully reversible
and $\delta$ does not change upon temperature cycling, we rule out
electron-beam irradiation during STEM as the driving mechanism. Instead, our
findings demonstrate that thermal strain can solely drive topotactic phase
transitions in perovskite oxide films, presenting opportunities for switchable
ionic devices.

elements of any finite dimensional restricted Lie algebra over an algebraically
closed field of characteristic $p>0$ is irreducible. This conjecture remains
open, but it is known to hold for a large class of simple restricted Lie
algebras, e.g. for Lie algebras of connected algebraic groups, and for Cartan
series $W, S$ and $H$.
  In this thesis we start by proving that Premet's conjecture can be reduced to
the semisimple case. The proof is straightforward. However, the reduction of
the semisimple case to the simple case is very non-trivial in prime
characteristic as semisimple Lie algebras are not always direct sums of simple
ideals. Then we consider some semisimple restricted Lie algebras. Under the
assumption that $p>2$, we prove that Premet's conjecture holds for the
semisimple restricted Lie algebra whose socle involves the special linear Lie
algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ tensored by the truncated polynomial ring
$k[X]/(X^{p})$. Then we extend this example to the semisimple restricted Lie
algebra whose socle involves $S\otimes \mathcal{O}(m; \underline{1})$, where
$S$ is any simple restricted Lie algebra such that $\text{ad} S=\text{Der} S$
and its nilpotent variety $\mathcal{N}(S)$ is irreducible, and $\mathcal{O}(m;
\underline{1})=k[X_1, \dots, X_m]/(X_1^p, \dots, X_m^p)$ is the truncated
polynomial ring in $m\geq 2$ variables.
  In the final chapter we assume that $p>3$. We confirm Premet's conjecture for
the minimal $p$-envelope $W(1; n)_{p}$ of the Zassenhaus algebra $W(1; n)$ for
all $n\geq 2$. This is the main result of the research paper [3] (see thesis)

interferometer configuration with multiple coupled optical cavities. Since
achieving the resonances of the arm cavities is the most challenging among the
lock acquisition processes, the scheme called arm length stabilization (ALS)
had been employed for lock acquisition of the arm cavities. We designed a new
type of the ALS, which is compatible with the interferometers having long arms
like the next generation GW detectors. The features of the new ALS are that the
control configuration is simpler than those of previous ones and that it is not
necessary to lay optical fibers for the ALS along the kilometer-long arms of
the detector. Along with simulations of its noise performance, an experimental
test of the new ALS was performed utilizing a single arm cavity of KAGRA. This
paper presents the first results of the test where we demonstrated that lock
acquisition of the arm cavity was achieved using the new ALS and residual noise
was measured to be $8.2\,\mathrm{Hz}$ in units of frequency, which is smaller
than the linewidth of the arm cavity and thus low enough to lock the full
interferometer of KAGRA in a repeatable and reliable manner.

promising technology that can achieve high spectrum and energy efficiency for
future wireless networks by integrating a massive number of low-cost and
passive reflecting elements. An RIS can manipulate the properties of an
incident wave, such as the frequency, amplitude, and phase, and, then, reflect
this manipulated wave to a desired destination, without the need for complex
signal processing. In this paper, the asymptotic optimality of achievable rate
in a downlink RIS system is analyzed under a practical RIS environment with its
associated limitations. In particular, a passive beamformer that can achieve
the asymptotic optimal performance by controlling the incident wave properties
is designed, under a limited RIS control link and practical reflection
coefficients. In order to increase the achievable system sum-rate, a modulation
scheme that can be used in an RIS without interfering with existing users is
proposed and its average symbol error ratio is asymptotically derived.
Moreover, a new resource allocation algorithm that jointly considers user
scheduling and power control is designed, under consideration of the proposed
passive beamforming and modulation schemes. Simulation results show that the
proposed schemes are in close agreement with their upper bounds in presence of
a large number of RIS reflecting elements thereby verifying that the achievable

wedge reconstruction and the unitarity of black hole evaporation in AdS/CFT.
The analysis of these papers however has a rather puzzling feature: all
calculations are done using bulk dynamics which are essentially those Hawking
used to predict information loss, but applying ideas from entanglement wedge
reconstruction seems to suggest a Page curve which is consistent with
information conservation. Why should two different calculations in the same
model give different answers for the Page curve?
  In this note we present a new pair of models which clarify this situation.
Our first model gives a holographic illustration of unitary black hole
evaporation, in which the analogue of the Hawking radiation purifies itself as
expected, and this purification is reproduced by the entanglement wedge
analysis. Moreover a smooth black hole interior persists until the last stages
the evaporation process. Our second model gives an alternative holographic
interpretation of the situation where the bulk evolution leads to information
loss: unlike in the models proposed so far, this bulk information loss is
correctly reproduced by the entanglement wedge analysis. This serves as an
illustration that quantum extremal surfaces are in some sense kinematic: the
time-dependence of the entropy they compute depends on the choice of bulk
dynamics. In both models no bulk quantum corrections need to be considered:
classical extremal surfaces are enough to do the job. We argue that our first
model is the one which gives the right analogy for what actually happens to
evaporating black holes, but we also emphasize that any complete resolution of

from photometric errors, stellar binarity, rotation and metallicity spread

sending a sophisticated request to local devices. The first attack utilizes DNS

real-time measurements from distribution-level sensors. Specifically, smart
meter data is available for almost every load with unfortunately low temporal
resolution, while distribution synchrophasor data is at very fast rates yet
available at limited locations. By combining these two types of data with
respective strengths, the problem is cast as a matrix recovery one with much
less number of observations than unknowns. To improve the recovery performance,
we introduce two regularization terms to promote a low rank plus sparse
structure of the load matrix via a difference transformation. Accordingly, the
recovery problem can be formulated as a convex optimization one which is
efficiently solvable. Numerical tests using real residential load data
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches in identifying
appliance activities and recovering the PV output profiles.

deal with this limitation, many researchers are investigating brain-inspired
computing, which would be a perfect alternative to the conventional Von Neumann
architecture based computers (CPU/GPU) that meet the requirements for computing
performance, but not for energy-efficiency. Therefore, neuromorphic hardware
circuits that are adaptable for both parallel and distributed computations need
to be designed. In this paper, we focus on Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with
a comprehensive study of information coding methods and hardware exploration.
In this context, we propose a framework for neuromorphic hardware design space
exploration, which allows to define a suitable architecture based on
application-specific constraints and starting from a wide variety of possible
architectural choices. For this framework, we have developed a behavioral level
simulator for neuromorphic hardware architectural exploration named NAXT.
Moreover, we propose modified versions of the standard Rate Coding technique to
make trade-offs with the Time Coding paradigm, which is characterized by the
low number of spikes propagating in the network. Thus, we are able to reduce
the number of spikes while keeping the same neuron's model, which results in an
SNN with fewer events to process. By doing so, we seek to reduce the amount of
power consumed by the hardware. Furthermore, we present three neuromorphic
hardware architectures in order to quantitatively study the implementation of
SNNs. These architectures are derived from a novel funnel-like Design Space
Exploration framework for neuromorphic hardware.

simulation methods which employ volumetric meshes require several hours or days
to run on a computer cluster. The boundary element method (BEM) is an effective
approach for modelling the wave field because only the boundaries of the hard

outburst of the pulsar in 2018. X-ray pulsations at 17.475 s were detected in
the source light curves up to ~79 keV. The evolution of the pulse profiles with
energy was found to be complex. A four-peaked profile at lower energies
gradually evolved into a double-peak structure at higher energies. The pulsed
fraction of the pulsar, calculated from the NuSTAR observation was found to
follow an anti-correlation trend with luminosity as observed during previous
giant X-ray outburst studies in 2009. The broadband spectrum of the pulsar is
well described by a composite model consisting of a cutoff power law model
modified with the interstellar absorption, a thermal blackbody component with a
temperature of $\approx$1 keV and a Gaussian function for the 6.4 keV iron
emission line. Though the pulsar was observed at the peak of the giant
outburst, there was no signature of presence of any cyclotron line feature in
the spectrum. The radius of the blackbody emitting region was estimated to be
$\approx$2 km, suggesting that the most probable site of its origin is the
stellar surface of the neutron star. Physical models were also explored to

  version, to appear in PTRF",,,,"math.PR math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $G$ be a Cayley graph of a nonamenable group with spectral radius $\rho <
1$. It is known that branching random walk on $G$ with offspring distribution
$\mu$ is transient, i.e., visits the origin at most finitely often almost
surely, if and only if the expected number of offspring $\bar \mu$ satisfies
$\bar \mu \leq \rho^{-1}$. Benjamini and M\""uller (2010) conjectured that
throughout the transient supercritical phase $1<\bar{\mu} \leq \rho^{-1}$, and
in particular at the recurrence threshold $\bar \mu = \rho^{-1}$, the trace of
the branching random walk is tree-like in the sense that it is infinitely-ended
almost surely on the event that the walk survives forever. This is essentially
equivalent to the assertion that two independent copies of the branching random
walk intersect at most finitely often almost surely. We prove this conjecture,
along with several other related conjectures made by the same authors.
  A central contribution of this work is the introduction of the notion of
local unimodularity, which we expect to have several further applications in
the future.

the charged particle distributions, and the timing of the showers for different
geometric configurations. We analyze the impact of the decay length and
different decay modes of the tau on particle distributions and compare to
primaries usually utilized to simulate a tau shower, such as gammas, electrons,

these showers and analyze the often ignored muon channel of the tau decay.

produced based on computationally demanding forecasts of three-dimensional
ocean currents. Herein, we investigate a complementary approach for shorter

filter applied to a simplified ocean model. To achieve this, we present a new
algorithmic design for a data-assimilation system in which all components -
including the model, model errors, and particle filter - take advantage of
massively parallel compute architectures, such as graphical processing units.
Faster computations can enable in-situ and ad-hoc model runs for emergency
management, and larger ensembles for better uncertainty quantification. Using a
challenging test case with near-realistic chaotic instabilities, we run
data-assimilation experiments based on synthetic observations from drifting and
moored buoys, and analyse the trajectory forecasts for the drifters. Our
results show that even sparse drifter observations are sufficient to
significantly improve short-term drift forecasts up to twelve hours. With
equidistant moored buoys observing only 0.1% of the state space, the ensemble
gives an accurate description of the true state after data assimilation
followed by a high-quality probabilistic forecast.

optimal linear state estimator is introduced, which uses the send-on-delta data

measurement strategy, the burden over the wireless sensor network is reduced
due to the transmission of events only when there is a significant variation in

Kalman filter with the additional steps for the centralized fusion of events
data and optimal reconstruction of signals by projection onto convex sets. Also
for the practical feasibility analysis, this paper developed an Internet of

requirements of the proposed state estimator in a microgrid.

and magnetic fields, its wave function accumulates a duality-invariant quantum
phase, which is topological because it depends on a winding number and is
nonlocal because the enclosed fields act on the dyon in regions where these
fields vanish. Here, we derive this dyon phase and show how its duality
symmetry unifies the Aharonov-Bohm phase with its dual phase. We obtain the
energy levels, the two-slit interference shift, and the scattering amplitude
associated with the duality-invariant quantum phase. Assuming that the dyon has
spin 1/2, we show that this spin does not affect the introduced phase. We argue
that a spin 1/2 dyon has electric and magnetic moments, the former being
greater than the latter because of the Schwinger-Zwanziger quantisation
condition.

Here we propose an architecture to significantly speed-up spatiotemporal analog

operational analog ensemble search through more than 2 years of radar archive

  Furthermore, a novel approximation scheme is introduced in order to

an over-segmentation of the image, discarding the unlikely Stixel cuts, and
apply the algorithm only on the remaining Stixel cuts. This work presents a
novel over-segmentation strategy based on a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN),

acid-base environment during pregnancy and the smooth transition from
intra-uterine to extra-uterine life. Current methods to assess fetal pH and
acid-base status are invasive and carry significant maternal and fetal risks.
Given these limitations, obstetrical care providers developed the electronic
fetal monitoring (EFM) system, a non-invasive tool, which evaluates
beat-to-beat fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns in order to predict fetal
oxygenation status in real-time. Every year, about 85 percent of the
approximately 4 million live births in the United States are evaluated using
EFM. Unfortunately, though there is ample physiological evidence that FHR
patterns are inextricably linked to fetal acid-base status, the use of EFM has
not been shown to reliably predict neonatal pH, nor has it reduced the
incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes, including long-term neurological
morbidity and cerebral palsy (CP). The poor specificity associated with the
current interpretation of the EFM therefore leads to a paradox we have
henceforth defined as the Obstetrical Paradox. In this study, we develop and
seek to determine whether a novel, non-invasive method known as the FETAL
technique (Fourier Evaluation of Tracings and Acidosis in Labor), which applies
the Fourier Transform to EFM tracings and determines the spectral frequency
distributions of the FHR, improves the assessment of the fetal pH in real time.
We hypothesize that the improvement in the sensitivity and specificity of the
EFM with the use of the FETAL technique will lead to a significant reduction in
the rate of neonatal hypoxic injury and in the rate of caesarean deliveries for
suspected fetal distress. The implications of a successful application of the
FETAL technique would have paradigm-shifting consequences in the provision of

images with model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has proven difficult. A
promising approach is to learn a latent representation together with the
control policy. However, fitting a high-capacity encoder using a scarce reward
signal is sample inefficient and leads to poor performance. Prior work has
shown that auxiliary losses, such as image reconstruction, can aid efficient
representation learning. However, incorporating reconstruction loss into an
off-policy learning algorithm often leads to training instability. We explore
the underlying reasons and identify variational autoencoders, used by previous
investigations, as the cause of the divergence. Following these findings, we
propose effective techniques to improve training stability. This results in a
simple approach capable of matching state-of-the-art model-free and model-based
algorithms on MuJoCo control tasks. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates
robustness to observational noise, surpassing existing approaches in this

response to this urgent problem, this paper proposes a novel WLAN indoor

Multiple Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (Minimized-MKMMD). Firstly, the
multi-branch deep convolutional neural network is used to conduct the
dimensionality reduction and feature fusion of the RSS data, and the tags are
obtained according to the features of the offline and online RSS fusion
features that are corresponding to the silence and intrusion states, and then
based on this, the source domain and target domain are constructed
respectively. Secondly, the optimal transfer matrix is constructed by
minimizing MKMMD. Thirdly, the transferred RSS data in the source domain is
utilized for training the classifiers that are applying in getting the
classification of the RSS fusion features in the target domain in the same
shared subspace. Finally, the intrusion detection of the target environment is
realized by iteratively updating the process above until the algorithm
converges. The experimental results show that the proposed method can
effectively improve the accuracy and robustness of the intrusion detection

smell in accordance with events in a virtual world. As users approached a
virtual fire, they felt heat from three 2 kW heaters and smelled smoke from a

in a comparable AV VE, which ratings and verbatim responses indicated was down
to a greater belief that participants were in a real fire. However, a study of

offer benefits over AV as measured by a written knowledge test and subjective

However, in many parts of the world, street maps are incomplete or lag behind
new construction. Editing maps today involves a tedious process of manually
tracing and annotating roads, buildings, and other map features.
  Over the past decade, many automatic map inference systems have been proposed
to automatically extract street map data from satellite imagery, aerial
imagery, and GPS trajectory datasets. However, automatic map inference has
failed to gain traction in practice due to two key limitations: high error
rates (low precision), which manifest in noisy inference outputs, and a lack of
end-to-end system design to leverage inferred data to update existing street
maps.
  At MIT and QCRI, we have developed a number of algorithms and approaches to

three components to robustly accelerate the mapping process over traditional

proposed method is mostly due to the high power of the polarimetry to
discriminate any object by its reflective properties and on the use of deep
neural networks for object detection. Our goal by this work, is to prove that
polarimetry brings a real added value compared with RGB images for object

Latin letters, digits and two other symbols. We show how we can encode and
decode base64 data at nearly the speed of a memory copy (memcpy) on recent
Intel processors, as long as the data does not fit in the first-level (L1)
cache. We use the SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) instruction set
AVX-512 available on commodity processors. Our implementation generates several
times fewer instructions than previous SIMD-accelerated base64 codecs. It is
also more versatile, as it can be adapted---even at runtime---to any base64
variant by only changing constants.

imbuing many edge devices with intelligence. Microcontrollers (MCUs) are an
attractive platform for building smart devices due to their low cost, wide
availability, and modest power usage. However, they lack the computational
resources to run neural networks as straightforwardly as mobile or server
platforms, which necessitates changes to the network architecture and the
inference software. In this work, we discuss the deployment and memory concerns
of neural networks on MCUs and present a way of saving memory by changing the
execution order of the network's operators, which is orthogonal to other
compression methods. We publish a tool for reordering operators of TensorFlow
Lite models and demonstrate its utility by sufficiently reducing the memory
footprint of a CNN to deploy it on an MCU with 512KB SRAM.

frequency band when its rate drops below a threshold on the current band. The
UE is then instructed by the base station (BS) to measure the quality of
candidate bands, which requires a measurement gap in the data transmission,
thus lowering the data rate. We propose an online-learning based band switching
approach that does not require any measurement gap. Our proposed
classifier-based band switching policy instead exploits spatial and spectral
correlation between radio frequency signals in different bands based on
knowledge of the UE location. We focus on switching between a lower (e.g., 3.5
GHz) band and a millimeter wave band (e.g., 28 GHz), and design and evaluate
two classification models that are trained on a ray-tracing dataset. A key
insight is that measurement gaps are overkill, in that only the relative order
of the bands is necessary for band selection, rather than a full channel
estimate. Our proposed machine learning based policies achieve roughly 30%
improvement in mean effective rates over those of the industry standard policy,
while achieving misclassification errors well below 0.5% and maintaining
resilience against blockage uncertainty.

state of the art in machine translation. Yet these neural networks are very
sensitive to architecture and hyperparameter settings. Optimizing these
settings by grid or random search is computationally expensive because it
requires many training runs. In this paper, we incorporate architecture search
into a single training run through auto-sizing, which uses regularization to
delete neurons in a network over the course of training. On very low-resource
language pairs, we show that auto-sizing can improve BLEU scores by up to 3.9
points while removing one-third of the parameters from the model.

  Adaptation in Natural Language Generation","Published in SIGDIAL2019",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Domain adaptation in natural language generation (NLG) remains challenging
because of the high complexity of input semantics across domains and limited
data of a target domain. This is particularly the case for dialogue systems,
where we want to be able to seamlessly include new domains into the
conversation. Therefore, it is crucial for generation models to share knowledge
across domains for the effective adaptation from one domain to another. In this
study, we exploit a tree-structured semantic encoder to capture the internal
structure of complex semantic representations required for multi-domain
dialogues in order to facilitate knowledge sharing across domains. In addition,
a layer-wise attention mechanism between the tree encoder and the decoder is
adopted to further improve the model's capability. The automatic evaluation
results show that our model outperforms previous methods in terms of the BLEU
score and the slot error rate, in particular when the adaptation data is
limited. In subjective evaluation, human judges tend to prefer the sentences
generated by our model, rating them more highly on informativeness and
naturalness than other systems.

solid surface. It is assumed within the framework of this model that an
encounter of an atom (or ion) with the surface is a series of elastic (in the
direction normal to the surface) hits of the atom against surface
pseudoparticles, the hits instantly following each other. To each atom, one
assigns two infinite sequences of masses of pseudoparticles. The model is a
far-reaching generalization of the well-known hard cube model. Criteria for
both finiteness and infinity of series of hits are formulated, based on the
masses of pseudoparticles and the mass of the atom. It is shown that in
virtually all the cases, any number of hits in a series occurs with a positive
probability. The proposed model does not satisfy the reciprocity condition.
