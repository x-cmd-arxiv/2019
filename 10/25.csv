quadratic sparse generation and nonlinear detection in the Fourier plane. We
demonstrate that traditional time-slice approaches are prone to essential

by our technique. As a proof-of-concept of our implementation, we show that we

prominences and/or filaments. These oscillations are excited by a large scale
shock wave, impulsive flares at one leg of the filament threads, or due to any
low coronal eruptions. We report simultaneous longitudinal and transverse
oscillations in the filament threads of a quiescent region filament. We observe
a big filament in the north-west of the solar disk on $6^{th}$ July 2017. On
$7^{th}$ July 2017 it starts rising around 13:00 UT. Then we observe a failed
eruption and subsequently, the filament threads start to oscillate around 16
UT. We observe both transverse and longitudinal oscillations in a filament
thread. The oscillations damp down and filament threads almost disappear. We
place horizontal and vertical artificial slits on the filament threads to
capture the longitudinal and transverse oscillations of the threads. Data from
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is
used to detect the oscillations. We find the signatures of large amplitude
longitudinal oscillations (LALOs). We also detect damping in LALOs. In one
thread of the filament, we observe large amplitude transverse oscillations
(LATOs). Using the pendulum model we estimate the lower limit of magnetic field
strength and radius of curvature from the observed parameter of LALOs. We show
the co-existence of two different wave modes in the same filament threads. We
estimate magnetic field from LALOs and hence suggest a possible range of the
length of the filament threads using LATOs.

can make decisions without the coordination of a central authority. Social
insects, birds, fishes, and many other living collectives, rely on simple
interaction mechanisms to do so. They individually gather information from the
environment; small bits of a much larger picture that are then shared locally
among the members of the collective and processed together to output a commonly
agreed choice. Throughout evolution, Nature found solutions to collective
decision-making problems that are intriguing to engineers for their robustness
to malfunctioning or lost individuals, their flexibility in face of dynamic
environments, and their ability to scale with large numbers of members. In the
last decades, whereas biologists amassed large amounts of experimental
evidence, engineers took inspiration from these and other examples to design
distributed algorithms that, while maintaining the same properties of their
natural counterparts, come with guarantees on their performance in the form of
predictive mathematical models. In this paper, we review the fundamental
processes that lead to a collective decision. We discuss examples of collective
decisions in biological systems and show how similar processes can be
engineered to design artificial ones. During this journey, we review a
framework to design distributed decision-making algorithms that are modular,
can be instantiated and extended in different ways, and are supported by a suit
of predictive mathematical models.

time-frequency. In the considered setting, the number of potential users
$K_\text{tot}$ is much larger than $L$ but at each time slot only
$K_a<<K_\text{tot}$ of them are active. Previous results, based on compressed
sensing, require that $K_a\leq L$, which is a bottleneck in massive deployment
scenarios such as Internet-of-Things and unsourced random access. In this work
we show that such limitation can be overcome when the number of base station
antennas $M$ is sufficiently large. We also provide two algorithms. One is
based on Non-Negative Least-Squares, for which the above scaling result can be
rigorously proved. The other consists of a low-complexity iterative
componentwise minimization of the likelihood function of the underlying
problem. Finally, we use the discussed approximated ML algorithm as the decoder
for the inner code in a concatenated coding scheme for unsourced random access,
a grant-free uncoordinated multiple access scheme where all users make use of
the same codebook, and the massive MIMO base station must come up with the list
of transmitted messages irrespectively of the identity of the transmitters. We
show that reliable communication is possible at any $E_b/N_0$ provided that a
sufficiently large number of base station antennas is used, and that a sum
spectral efficiency in the order of $\mathcal{O}(L\log(L))$ is achievable.

star-forming complexes, in which no O-type stars had previously been
identified, we find a total of 13 newly identified O-type stars in the mass
range 15-50 M$_{\odot}$, as well as 4 Wolf-Rayet stars. We use the derived
massive stellar content to analyze the impact of stellar feedback on the HII
regions. As already found for HII regions in the Magellanic Clouds, the
dynamics of the analyzed NGC 300 HII regions are dominated by a combination of
the pressure of the ionized gas and stellar winds. By comparing the derived
ionized gas mass loading factors to the total gas mass loading factor across
the NGC 300 disk, we find that the latter is an order of magnitude higher,
either indicating very early evolutionary stages for these HII regions, or
being a direct result of the multi-phase nature of feedback-driven bubbles.
Moreover, we analyze the relation between the star formation rate and the
pressure of the ionized gas as derived from small (<100 pc) scales, as both
quantities are systematically overestimated when derived on galactic scales.
With the wealth of ongoing and upcoming IFU instruments and programs, this
study serves as a pathfinder for the systematic investigation of resolved

tools to enable massive stellar content and feedback studies sampling an

$G_{\text{SM}}=SU(3)\times SU(2) \times U(1)$ and $\Gamma_n$ isomorphic to
$\mathbb{Z}/n$ where $n\in\left\{1,2,3,6\right\}$. In addition to deriving
constraints on the hypercharges of fields transforming in arbitrary
representations of the $SU(3)\times SU(2)$ factor, we study the possibility of
global anomalies in theories with these gauge groups by computing the bordism
groups $\Omega^{\text{Spin}}_5(BG)$ using the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral
sequence. In two cases we show that there are no global anomalies beyond the
Witten anomaly, while in the other cases we show that there are no global
anomalies at all, illustrating the subtle interplay between local and global
anomalies. While freedom from global anomalies has been previously shown for
the specific fermion content of the SM by embedding the SM in an anomaly-free
$SU(5)$ GUT, our results here remain true when the SM fermion content is
extended arbitrarily. Going beyond the SM gauge groups, we show that there are
no new global anomalies in extensions of the (usual) SM gauge group by $U(1)^m$
for any integer $m$, which correspond to phenomenologically well-motivated BSM
theories featuring multiple $Z^\prime$ bosons. Nor do we find any new global
anomalies in various grand unified theories, including Pati-Salam and
trinification models. We also consider global anomalies in a family of theories
with gauge group $SU(N)\times Sp(M)\times U(1)$, which share the phase
structure of the SM for certain $(N, M)$.

different geometries have been employed to realize a variety of components.
Therefore, efficient coupling of two different waveguides is crucial. In this
paper, focusing property of the Luneburg lens is exploited to design waveguide
tapers. The Luneburg lens, truncated in a shape of a parabolic taper with
reduced footprint, is utilized to connect a 10 $\mu$m-wide waveguide to a 0.5
$\mu$m one with the same thickness with an average coupling loss of 0.35 dB in
the entire O, E, S, C, L, and U bands of optical communications. The proposed
compact taper with the length of 11 $\mu$m is implemented by varying the
thickness of the guiding layer and compared with three conventional tapers with
the same length. However, designing a coupler to connect waveguides with
different thicknesses and widths is more challenging. By applying
quasi-conformal transformation optics, we flatten the Luneburg lens and
consequently increase the refractive index on the flattened side. As a result,
we are able to couple two waveguides with different thicknesses and widths. The
numerical simulations are used to evaluate the theoretically designed tapers.
To our knowledge, this is the first study presenting ultrashort tapers based on
truncated Luneburg lens.

planetesimals left over from primary accretion, asteroids from the E-belt, and
comets arriving from the outer Solar System. We present estimates of the amount
of cometary material striking the terrestrial planets in an early episode of
planetesimal-driven giant planet migration (Mojzsis et al., 2019). The Moon and
Mars suffer proportionally higher cometary accretion than Venus and Earth. The
background mass addition from small leftover planetesimals to Earth and Mars is
far less than independent estimates based on their mantle abundances of
highly-siderophile elements. This supports the theory that both planets were
struck by single large bodies that delivered most of their mass augmentation
since primary accretion. We present fits to the impact chronologies valid from
4500 Ma to ca. 3700 Ma. The lunar timeline thus obtained is at odds with both
the calibrated Neukum (Neukum et al., 2001) and Werner (Werner et al., 2014;
Werner, 2019) chronologies. For Mars, the match with its calibrated Werner
chronology is no better; by increasing the mass of the E-belt by a factor of
four the dynamical lunar and martian chronologies are in line with that of
Werner (2019) and match constraints from the current population of Hungaria
asteroids. Yet, neither of our dynamical timelines fit well with that of
Neukum. The dynamical lunar and martian chronologies are also different from
each other. Consequently, the usual extrapolation of such chronologies from one
planetary body to the other is technically inappropriate.

densely studied but there is still a large gap between weakly-supervised models
and fully-supervised models. It is practical and intuitive to annotate temporal
boundaries of a few examples and utilize them to help WTAL models better detect
actions. However, the train-test discrepancy of action localization strategy
prevents WTAL models from leveraging semi-supervision for further improvement.
At training time, attention or multiple instance learning is used to aggregate
predictions of each snippet for video-level classification; at test time, they
first obtain action score sequences over time, then truncate segments of scores
higher than a fixed threshold, and post-process action segments. The
inconsistent strategy makes it hard to explicitly supervise the action
localization model with temporal boundary annotations at training time. In this
paper, we propose a Train-Test Consistent framework, TTC-Loc. In both training
and testing time, our TTC-Loc localizes actions by comparing scores of action
classes and predicted threshold, which enables it to be trained with
semi-supervision. By fixing the train-test discrepancy, our TTC-Loc
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS'14,
ActivityNet 1.2 and 1.3 when only video-level labels are provided for training.
With full annotations of only one video per class and video-level labels for

above, even the heaviest electroweak force carriers could act as long-range
forces, leading to the existence of meta-stable DM bound states. The formation
and subsequent decay of the latter further deplete the relic density during the
freeze-out process on top of the Sommerfeld enhancement, allowing for larger DM
masses. While so far the bound-state formation was described via the emission
of an on-shell mediator ($W^{\pm}$, $Z$, $H$, $g$, photon or exotic), we point
out that this particular process does not have to be the dominant
scattering-bound state conversion channel in general. If the mediator is
coupled in a direct way to any relativistic species present in the Early
Universe, the bound-state formation can efficiently occur through particle
scattering, where a mediator is exchanged virtually. To demonstrate that such a
virtually stimulated conversion process can dominate the on-shell emission even
for all temperatures, we analyze a simplified model where DM is coupled to only
one relativistic species in the primordial plasma through an electroweak-scale
mediator. We find that the bound-state formation cross section via particle
scattering can exceed the on-shell emission by up to several orders of
magnitude.

associated with strategic choices, player behavior and risk, using their choice
of language prior to the game. We collected a dataset of transcripts from key
NBA players' pre-game interviews and their in-game performance metrics,
totalling in 5,226 interview-metric pairs. We design neural models for players'
action prediction based on increasingly more complex aspects of the language
signals in their open-ended interviews. Our models can make their predictions

past-performance metrics. Our text-based models outperform strong baselines
trained on performance metrics only, demonstrating the importance of language
usage for action prediction. Moreover, the models that employ both textual

with previous work, we find that the lunar core is dynamically decoupled from

history. Our model predicts that the lunar core rotates sub-synchronously, and
the difference between the core and the mantle rotational rates was significant
when the Moon had a high forced obliquity during and after the Cassini State
transition. We find that the presence of the lunar liquid core further
destabilizes synchronous rotation of the mantle for a wide range of semimajor
axes centered around the Cassini State transition. CMB torques make it even
more likely that the Moon experienced large-scale inclination damping during
the Cassini State transition. We present estimates for the mutual core-mantle
obliquity as a function of Earth-Moon distance, and we discuss plausible

original benchmark with new Chinese instructions. Based on this newly
introduced dataset, we study how an agent can be trained on existing English
instructions but navigate effectively with another language under a zero-shot

shows competitive results even compared to a model with full access to the

some of the most important formalisms of transport theory, while Part II
provides a presentation and discussion of my own work. The order in which these
parts are read is not important, as long as the reader is prepared to accept
that part II references a few topics in part I.
  Part 1 discusses 6 different theoretical frameworks: The Landauer B\""uttiker
framework, the Keldysh field integral, linear response theory, Non-Equilibrium
Green's function (NEGF) formalism, Markovian Master equations, and the semi
classical Boltzmann equation. Considerable weight is put on illuminating the
connections between these frameworks, and in particular an attempt is made to
derive all of the latter four as a sequence of approximations starting from the
Keldysh field integral, admittedly with some appeals to physical intuition.
  While part 1 is mostly concerned with fundamental theory, the focus of part 2
is on computational and numerical aspects. It discusses a set of practical
calculations we have made, using a subset of the formalisms from part 1. In
particular, we have made use of the Boltzmann Monte Carlo method to solve the
Boltzmann equation, applying both direct calculations and the Green Kubo
relations of linear response. We have also made some calculations in the
Landauer B\""uttiker framework, utilizing B\""uttikers approximation to introduce
scattering in an otherwise ballistic solver. Finally, we have performed a set
of calculations within the NEGF framework, which illustrate a simple
perturbative approach useful for speeding up the calculations of Gr, as well as
a Monte Carlo method developed of our own.

arise from pinches in the complex planes of loop momenta, called pinch

systematically. In this paper, we utilize the position-space analysis of
Erdogan and Sterman for Green functions, and develop the formalism for momentum
space. A related analysis has been carried out by Collins for the Sudakov form
factors, and is generalized here to any wide-angle kinematics with an arbitrary
number of external momenta. We will first see that the approximations yield
much richer IR structures than those of an original amplitude, then construct
the forest formula and prove that all the singularities appearing in its
subtraction terms cancel pairwise. With the help of the forest formula, the
full amplitude can also be reorganized into a factorized expression, which
helps to generalize the Sudakov form factor result to arbitrary numbers of
external momenta. All our analysis will be on the amplitude level.

obtained from an Ile-Ife station (geomagnetic lat. \ang{9.84}N, long. 77.25
degree E, Dip \ang{7.25}N). Total Electron Content (TEC) profiles during the
main phase of the two geomagnetically disturbed days were compared with quiet
time average profiles to examine the response of the equatorial ionosphere. The
results showed that the intensity of both storm events during the main phase
which occurred at night-time correlated well with a strong southward direction
of the z-component of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF-Bz) and Solar Wind
Speed (Vsw), with the Disturbance storm time (Dst) profile showing multiple
step development. TEC depletion was observed during the main phase of the
August 5 - 6, 2011 storm event with TEC recording a maximum value of 9.31 TECU.
A maximum TEC value of 55.8 TECU was recorded during the main phase of the
September 26 - 27, 2011 storm event depicting TEC enhancement. Significant
scintillation index value of 0.57 was observed when the main phase started on
August 5 - 6, 2011 followed by a prolonged suppression while there was less
significant scintillation impact on September 26 - 27, 2011 with a maximum
value of 0.33. The present study show that rapid energy input from solar wind

oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast has been conventionally focused on
probing gray matter, the BOLD contrast in white matter having been generally
disregarded. Recent results have provided evidence of the functional
significance of the white matter BOLD signal, showing at the same time that its
correlation structure is highly anisotropic, and related to the diffusion
tensor in shape and orientation. This evidence suggests that conventional
isotropic Gaussian filters are inadequate for denoising white matter fMRI data,
since they are incapable of adapting to the complex anisotropic domain of white
matter axonal connections. In this paper we explore a graph-based description
of the white matter developed from diffusion MRI data, which is capable of
encoding the anisotropy of the domain. Based on this representation we design
localized spatial filters that adapt to white matter structure by leveraging
graph signal processing principles. The performance of the proposed filtering
technique is evaluated on semi-synthetic data, where it shows potential for
greater sensitivity and specificity in white matter activation mapping,
compared to isotropic filtering.

the limits of existing approaches, we present a challenging benchmark in which

We train a dozen NNs using two reinforcement learning algorithms and show that
the state of the art in verification can handle systems with around 40 LiDAR
rays, well short of a typical LiDAR scan with 1081 rays. Furthermore, we
perform real experiments to investigate the benefits and limitations of
verification with respect to the sim2real gap, i.e., the difference between a
system's modeled and real performance. We identify cases, similar to the
modeled environment, in which verification is strongly correlated with safe
behavior. Finally, we illustrate LiDAR fault patterns that can be used to
develop robust and safe reinforcement learning algorithms.

rate of cancer. Metastasis can occur after malignant cells transition from the
epithelial phenotype to the mesenchymal phenotype. This transformation allows
cells to migrate via the circulatory system and subsequently settle in distant
organs after undergoing the reverse transition from the mesenchymal to the
epithelial phenotypes. The core gene regulatory network controlling these
transitions consists of a system made up of coupled SNAIL/miRNA-34 and
ZEB1/miRNA-200 subsystems. In this work, we formulate a mathematical model of
the core regulatory motif and analyze its long-term behavior. We start by
developing a detailed reaction network with 24 state variables. Assuming fast
promoter and mRNA kinetics, we then show how to reduce our model to a monotone
four-dimensional system. For the reduced system, monotone dynamical systems
theory can be used to prove generic convergence to the set of equilibria for
all bounded trajectories. The theory does not apply to the full model, which is
not monotone, but we briefly discuss results for singularly-perturbed monotone
systems that provide a tool to extend convergence results from reduced to full
systems, under appropriate time separation assumptions.

of phantoms for simultaneous PET/MRI systems.
  Methods: Plaster was used as the basis for the bone material analogues tested
in this study. It was mixed with varying concentrations of an iodinated CT
contrast, a gadolinium-based MR contrast agent, and copper sulfate to modulate
the attenuation properties and MRI properties (T1 and T2*). Attenuation was
measured with CT and 68Ge transmission scans, and MRI properties were measured
with quantitative ultrashort echo time pulse sequences. A proof-of-concept
skull was created by plaster casting.
  Results: Undoped plaster has a 511 keV attenuation coefficient (~0.14 cm-1)
similar to cortical bone (0.10-0.15 cm-1), but slightly longer T1 (~500 ms) and
T2* (~1.2 ms) MR parameters compared to bone (T1 ~ 300 ms, T2* ~ 0.4 ms).
Doping with the iodinated agent resulted in increased attenuation with minimal
perturbation to the MR parameters. Doping with a gadolinium chelate greatly
reduced T1 and T2*, resulting in extremely short T1 values when the target T2*
values were reached, while the attenuation coefficient was unchanged. Doping
with copper sulfate was more selective for T2* shortening and achieved
comparable T1 and T2* values to bone (after 1 week of drying), while the
attenuation coefficient was unchanged.
  Conclusions: Plaster doped with copper sulfate is a promising bone material
analogue for a PET/MRI phantom, mimicking the MR properties (T1 and T2*) and
511 keV attenuation coefficient of human cortical bone.

4395, based on three archival $XMM-Newton$ and one archival $NuSTAR$
observations. The source is known to harbor a low mass black hole ($\sim 10^4-
{\rm a~ few~}\times 10^{5}~\rm M_\odot$) and shows strong variability in the
full X-ray range during these observations. We model the flux-resolved spectra
of the source assuming three absorbing layers: neutral, mildly ionized, and
highly ionized ($N_{\rm H} \sim 1.6\times 10^{22}-3.4 \times 10^{23}~\rm
cm^{-2}$, $\sim 0.8-7.8 \times 10^{22}~\rm cm^{-2}$, and $ 3.8 \times
10^{22}~\rm cm^{-2}$, respectively. The source also shows intrinsic variability
by a factor of $\sim 3$, on short timescales, due to changes in the nuclear
flux, assumed to be a power law ($\Gamma = 1.6-1.67$). Our results show a
positive correlation between the intrinsic flux and the absorbers' ionization
parameter. The covering fraction of the neutral absorber varies during the
first $XMM-Newton$ observation, which could explain the pronounced soft X-ray
variability. However, the source remains fully covered by this layer during the
other two observations, largely suppressing the soft X-ray variability. This
suggests an inhomogeneous and layered structure in the broad line region. We
also find a difference in the characteristic timescale of the power spectra
between different energy ranges and observations. We finally show simulated
spectra with $XRISM$, $Athena$, and $eXTP$, which will allow us to characterize
the different absorbers, study their dynamics, and will help us identify their
locations and sizes.

long-lived samples of YbOH molecules are within reach and these will allow a
high sensitivity probe of the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron. The
approach demonstrated here is easily generalized to other isotopologues of YbOH

bounding box annotations. Collecting these annotations is laborious and costly,
yet supervised models do not generalize well when testing on images from a
different distribution. Domain adaptation provides a solution by adapting
existing labels to the target testing data. However, a large gap between
domains could make adaptation a challenging task, which leads to unstable
training processes and sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose to bridge
the domain gap with an intermediate domain and progressively solve easier
adaptation subtasks. This intermediate domain is constructed by translating the
source images to mimic the ones in the target domain. To tackle the
domain-shift problem, we adopt adversarial learning to align distributions at
the feature level. In addition, a weighted task loss is applied to deal with
unbalanced image quality in the intermediate domain. Experimental results show
that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art method in terms
of the performance on the target domain.

Following this leading proposal, many experimental implementations as well as
variants of boson sampling have been shown. However, most of these works are
limited to small scale and cannot fulfill the permanent-of-Gaussians
conjecture. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the largest scale boson
sampling in the collision-free dominant regime using multi-port interferometer

Recent
approaches have made significant progress towards regressing the parameters of
parametric human body models directly from images. Because of the absence of
images with 3D shape ground truth, relevant approaches rely on 2D annotations
or sophisticated architecture designs. In this work, we advocate that there are
more cues we can leverage, which are available for free in natural images,
i.e., without getting more annotations, or modifying the network architecture.
We propose a natural form of supervision, that capitalizes on the appearance
constancy of a person among different frames (or viewpoints). This seemingly
insignificant and often overlooked cue goes a long way for model-based pose
estimation. The parametric model we employ allows us to compute a texture map
for each frame. Assuming that the texture of the person does not change
dramatically between frames, we can apply a novel texture consistency loss,
which enforces that each point in the texture map has the same texture value
across all frames. Since the texture is transferred in this common texture map
space, no camera motion computation is necessary, or even an assumption of
smoothness among frames. This makes our proposed supervision applicable in a
variety of settings, ranging from monocular video, to multi-view images. We
benchmark our approach against strong baselines that require the same or even
more annotations that we do and we consistently outperform them.
Simultaneously, we achieve state-of-the-art results among model-based pose
estimation approaches in different benchmarks. The project website with videos,
results, and code can be found at

studies on a series of the heterostructures (MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, MnBi$_4$Te$_7$ and
MnBi$_6$Te$_{10}$). A universal gapless Dirac cone is observed at the
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ terminated (0001) surfaces in all systems. This is in sharp
contrast to the expected gap from the original antiferromagnetic ground state,
indicating an altered magnetic structure near the surface, possibly due to the
surface termination. In the meantime, the electron band dispersion of the
surface states, presumably dominated by the top surface, is found to be
sensitive to different stackings of the underlying MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and

Isomorphism. More generally, it is of fundamental importance in understanding
and exploiting symmetries in graphs in various settings. Two graphs are
$k$-WL-equivalent if the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman procedure produces
the same final coloring on both graphs. 1-WL-equivalence is known as fractional
isomorphism of graphs, and the $k$-WL-equivalence relation becomes finer as $k$
increases.
  We investigate to what extent standard graph parameters are preserved by
$k$-WL-equivalence, focusing on fractional graph packing numbers. The integral
packing numbers are typically NP-hard to compute, and we discuss applicability

through an intermediate mesoscopic spin system (MSS) by indirect joint
measurement. Indirect joint measurement benefits from coherent magnification of
the target qubits' state in the collective magnetization of the MSS; such that
a low-resolution collective measurement on the MSS suffices to prepare
post-selected entanglement on the target qubits. A MSS consisting of two
non-interacting halves, each coupled to one of the target qubits is identified
as a geometry that allows implementing the magnification process with
experimentally available control tools. It is proved that the requirements on
the amplified state of the target qubits and the MSS perfectly map to the
specifications of micro-macro entanglement between each target qubit and its
nearby half of the MSS. In the light of this equivalence, the effects of
experimental imperfections are explored; in particular, bipartite entanglement
between the target qubits is shown to be robust to imperfect preparation of the
MSS. Our study provides a new approach for using an intermediate spin system
for connecting separated qubits. It also opens a new path in exploring
entanglement between microscopic and mesoscopic spin systems.

progress in studying galaxy populations in the very early Universe, during the
Epoch of Reionization (EoR). A critical parameter for understanding the sources
that reionized the Universe is the Lyman-continuum production efficiency,
$\xi_{\rm ion}$, defined as the rate of production of ionizing photons divided
by the intrinsic UV luminosity. In this work, we combine self-consistent star
formation and chemical enrichment histories predicted by semi-analytic models
of galaxy formation with stellar population synthesis (SPS) models to predict
the expected dependence of $\xi_{\rm ion}$ on galaxy properties and cosmic
epoch from $z=4-10$. We then explore the sensitivity of the production rate of
ionizing photons, $\dot{N}_{\rm ion}$, to the choice of SPS model and the
treatment of stellar feedback in our galaxy formation model. We compare our
results to those of other simulations, constraints from empirical models, and
observations. We find that adopting SPS models that include binary stars
predict about a factor of two more ionizing radiation than models that only
assume single stellar populations. We find that UV-faint, low-mass galaxies
have values of $\xi_{\rm ion}$ about 0.25 dex higher than those of more massive
galaxies, but find weak evolution with cosmic time, about 0.2 dex from $z\sim
12-4$ at fixed rest-UV luminosity. We provide predictions of $\dot{N}_{\rm

Galaxy. This result suggests that star formation in galactic nuclei may occur
close to the SMBH and produce initially flattened stellar discs. Here we
explore the possible build-up and evolution of nuclear stellar clusters near
SMBHs through in-situ star formation producing stellar discs similar to those
observed in the Galactic Centre and other nuclei. We make use of N-body
simulations to model the evolution of multiple young stellar discs and explore
the potential observable signatures imprinted by such processes. Each of the
five simulated discs is evolved for 100 Myr before the next one is introduced
in the system. We find that populations born at different epochs show different

supplemented by weak, smooth disorder stabilize a network of gapped quantum
valley Hall domains with spatially varying Chern numbers determined by the
disorder landscape--even when an entirely different order is favored in the
clean limit. Within this scenario, sufficiently small samples that realize a
single domain display insulating transport characteristics. Conversely,
multi-domain samples exhibit re-emergent massless Dirac fermions formed by
gapless domain-wall modes, yielding semimetallic behavior except on the
ultra-long scales at which localization becomes visible. We discuss
experimental tests of this proposal via local probes and transport. Our results
highlight the crucial role that randomness can play in ground-state selection

phenomenologically advantageous features, such as hierarchies between axion
couplings to different gauge fields and/or large effective field ranges. While
these features are strongly constrained by periodicity for models with only a
single axion, mixing has been used in the literature (sometimes incorrectly) to
try to evade some of these constraints. In this paper, we ask whether it is
possible to use axion mixing to generate an EFT of axions that evades these
constraints by flowing to a theory of a non-compact scalar in the IR. We
conclude that as long as the light axion is exactly massless, it will inherit
the periodicity and associated constraints of the UV theory. However, by giving
the light axion a mass, we can relax these constraints with effects
proportional to the axion mass squared, including non-quantized couplings and
the realignment of monodromy to a light axion with a larger field range. To
show this, we consider various examples of axions mixing with other axions or
with non-compact scalar fields, and work in a basis where coupling quantization
is manifest. This basis makes it clear that in the case where an axion is eaten
through the Higgs or Stuckelberg mechanism, the light axion does not have a
large effective field range, in contrast to some recent claims in the
literature. Additionally, we relate our results about axion EFTs to a
well-known fact about gauge theory: that QFTs with compact gauge groups in the
UV flow to QFTs with compact gauge groups in the IR, and make this
correspondence precise in the 2+1 dimensional case.

relations, unlike correlations, allow one to reason about the outcomes of
interventions. Algorithms that can discover causal relations from observational

in a single dataset. In many cases this assumption fails. Previous approaches
to overcoming this shortcoming devised algorithms that returned all joint
causal structures consistent with the conditional independence information
contained in each individual dataset. But, as conditional independence tests
only determine causal structure up to Markov equivalence, the number of
consistent joint structures returned by these approaches can be quite large.
The last decade has seen the development of elegant algorithms for discovering
causal relations beyond conditional independence, which can distinguish among
Markov equivalent structures. In this work we adapt and extend these so-called
bivariate causal discovery algorithms to the problem of learning consistent
causal structures from multiple datasets with overlapping variables belonging
to the same generating process, providing a sound and complete algorithm that
outperforms previous approaches on synthetic and real data.

cosmological weak lensing surveys such as Euclid or LSST. In this first paper
in a series of two, we use simulations to build a Euclid-like tomographic mock
data-set for the cosmic shear power spectrum and the corresponding covariance
matrix, which are both corrected for baryonic effects following the
baryonification method of Schneider et al. (2019). In addition, we develop an
emulator to obtain fast predictions of the baryonic power suppression, allowing
us to perform a likelihood inference analysis for a standard $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology with both cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Our main
findings are the following: (i) ignoring baryonic effects leads to a greater
than 5$\sigma$ bias on the cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$;
(ii) restricting the analysis to the largest scales, that are mostly unaffected
by baryons, makes the bias disappear, but results in a blow-up of the
$\Omega_m$-$\sigma_8$ contour area by more than a factor of 10; (iii) ignoring
baryonic effects on the covariance matrix does not significantly affect
cosmological parameter estimates; (iv) while the baryonic suppression is mildly
cosmology dependent, this effect does not noticeably modify the posterior
contours. Overall, we conclude that including baryonic uncertainties in terms
of nuisance parameters results in unbiased and surprisingly tight constraints

implementing the disorder into an auxiliary spin system, providing an exact

the disk of the galaxy, we identify filaments forming purely due to galactic

large-scale Galactic filaments are intrinsically rare, and we estimate that at
maximum approximately one filament per $\rm kpc^{2}$ should be identified in
projection, when viewed from the direction of our Sun in the Milky Way. In this
idealized scenario, we find filaments in both the arm and interarm regions, and
hypothesize that the former may be due to gas compression in the

physical properties of large-scale Galactic filaments, and quantify their
sensitivity to projection effects and galactic environment (i.e. whether they

($|\Delta g|>$ 1) we find that Mg II clearly does respond to the continuum.
However, the degree of responsiveness varies strikingly from one object to
another; we see cases of Mg II changing by as much as the continuum, more than
the continuum, or very little at all. In 74% of the highly variable sample the
behaviour of Mg II corresponds with that of H$\beta$, with 30% of the objects

In the solar corona, this heating may be responsible for the generation of the

plasma turbulence, but the specific kinetic mechanism that produces these
preferential effects is not known. Solar wind turbulence at proton scales is
often characterized in terms of highly oblique kinetic Alfv\'en waves (KAWs),
which have been thought to dissipate through the Landau resonance and yield
parallel heating. We show that the quasilinear resonant cyclotron interaction
between KAWs and solar wind ions can actually produce perpendicular ion
heating. We present an illustrative calculation of a steady, critically
balanced spectrum of KAWs acting on homogeneous ion distributions with a plasma
\b{eta} = 0.1, representative of turbulent conditions in the fast solar wind

find that thermal protons are strongly heated in the perpendicular direction

corresponds to only a few minutes at 20 Rs. Alpha particles in the same
fluctuation field are heated to similar perpendicular thermal speeds,
equivalent to the greater than mass proportional perpendicular temperatures

development comes from a finer theory of nonuniformly hyperbolic systems, which

dynamical and statistical consequences such as estimates on the number of
closed orbits and properties of equilibrium measures. The class of systems

phenomena in molecular and solid-state systems, or to dramatically alter the
physicochemical properties of matter, bypassing costly and time-consuming
synthetic modifications. In this article, we investigate theoretically some
interesting consequences of the fact that an originally achiral molecular
system can exhibit nonzero circular dichroism (CD) when it is driven with
elliptically polarized light. More specifically, we consider an isotropic
ensemble of small cyclic molecular aggregates in solution whose local
low-frequency vibrational modes are driven by an elliptically polarized
continuous-wave infrared pump. We attribute the origin of a nonzero CD signal
to time-reversal symmetry breaking due to an excitonic Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phase
arising from a time-varying laser electric field, together with coherent
interchromophoric exciton hopping. The obtained Floquet engineered excitonic AB
phases are far more tunable than analogous magnetically-induced electronic AB
phases in nanoscale rings, highlighting a virtually unexplored potential that
Floquet engineered AB phases have in the coherent control of molecular
processes and simultaneously introducing new analogues of magneto-optical
effects in molecular systems which bypass the use of strong magnetic fields.

The radial dynamics, which corresponds to the inflaton field of the
cosmological counterpart, is analytically characterized: The expansion is found
to induce the oscillatory displacement of the condensate as well as the coupled
variation of the radial and vertical widths. Our findings account also for the
observed redshift and emergence of the Hubble friction in the evolution of

the different components of the setup in the expansion, enhances the

reduces to a generalised power iteration, whereby: (i) robust estimates of the

communications to connect underwater sensors/robots with remote surface base
stations. It is challenging to achieve such goal due to the harsh and dynamic
underwater acoustic channel. While Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO)
technique can enhance reliability and transmission range, it is difficult to
place multiple acoustic transducers on one single underwater device due to the
large wavelength. Although the cooperative MIMO technique that let multiple
underwater devices form a virtual MIMO system could solve the issue, it was
impossible to synchronize the distributed underwater devices due to the
extremely large and dynamic propagation delay of acoustic waves. To this end,
this paper proposes an underwater cooperative MIMO communication mechanism,
which is based on a hybrid acoustic and Magnetic Induction (MI) technique. The
inter-node synchronization problem can be perfectly solved by using the MI
technique so that the distributed acoustic transducers can cooperatively form
narrow beams for long distance underwater communications. The synchronization
time and errors are significantly reduced since MI has negligible signal
propagation delays. To quantitatively analyze the improvement, the closed-form
expressions of the synchronization error, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
effective communication time, and throughput of the proposed system are
rigorously derived. The proposed hybrid system is implemented in a
software-defined testbed under the beamforming and space-time coding scheme.
Through both numerical analysis and real-world experiments, the paper shows
that the proposed hybrid cooperative MIMO mechanism achieves much lower bit
error rate and synchronization error than the conventional acoustic systems.

brain regions under normal and abnormal conditions increases our understanding
of events at the level of neural interactions in the brain. The Izhikevich
model is one of the simplest biologically plausible models, i.e. capable of
capturing the most recognized firing patterns of neurons. This property makes
the model efficient in simulating the large-scale networks of neurons.
Improving the Izhikevich model for adapting to the neuronal activity of the rat
brain with great accuracy would make the model effective for future neural
network implementations. Methods- Data sampling from two brain regions, the HIP
and BLA, was performed by the extracellular recordings of male rats, and spike
sorting was conducted by Plexon offline sorter. Further analyses were performed
through NeuroExplorer and MATLAB. To optimize the Izhikevich model parameters,
a genetic algorithm was used. The process of comparison in each iteration leads
to the survival of better populations until achieving the optimum solution.
Results- In the present study, the possible firing patterns of the real single
neurons of the HIP and BLA were identified. Additionally, an improved
Izhikevich model was achieved. Accordingly, the real neuronal spiking pattern
of these regions neurons and the corresponding cases of the Izhikevich neuron
spiking pattern were adjusted with great accuracy. Conclusion- This study was
conducted to elevate our knowledge of neural interactions in different
structures of the brain and accelerate the quality of future large-scale neural
network simulations, as well as reducing the modeling complexity. This aim was
achievable by performing the improved Izhikevich model, and inserting only the
plausible firing patterns, and eliminating unrealistic ones.

particle-in-cell simulations, we study proton acceleration in axisymmetric
pulsar magnetospheres. Protons and electrons are extracted from the neutron
star surface by the strong electric field induced by the rotation of the star,
and electrons and positrons are produced in the magnetosphere through pair
production process. As pair production has a crucial impact on electromagnetic
fields, on gaps and thus on particle acceleration, we study its influence on
the maximum energy and luminosity of protons escaping the magnetosphere.
Protons are accelerated and escape in all our simulations. However, the
acceleration sites are different for the protons and the pairs. As shown in
previous studies, pairs are accelerated to their highest energies at the
Y-point and in the equatorial current sheet, where magnetic reconnection plays
and important role. In contrast, protons gain most of their kinetic energy
below the light-cylinder radius within the separatrix current layers, but they
are not confined within the equatorial current sheet. Their maximum Lorentz
factors can reach $15\%$ to $75\%$ of the maximum Lorentz factor obtained by
acceleration through the full vacuum potential drop from pole to equator, and
increase with decreasing pair production. Their luminosity can reach $0.2\%$ to
$4\%$ of the theoretical spin down luminosity of an aligned pulsar, and the
minimum luminosity is obtained at the transition between the force-free and
electrosphere regimes. These estimates support that millisecond pulsars could
accelerate cosmic rays up to PeV energies and that new born millisecond pulsars
could accelerate cosmic rays up to ultra-high energies.

model-reduction of dynamical systems. The proposed approach sequentially
minimizes the time-continuous full-order-model residual within a
low-dimensional space-time trial subspace over time windows. The approach
comprises a generalization of existing model reduction approaches, as
particular instances of the methodology recover Galerkin, least-squares
Petrov-Galerkin (LSPG), and space-time LSPG projection. In addition, the
approach addresses key deficiencies in existing model-reduction techniques,
e.g., the dependence of LSPG and space-time LSPG projection on the time
discretization and the exponential growth in time exhibited by a posteriori
error bounds for both Galerkin and LSPG projection. We consider two types of
space-time trial subspaces within the proposed approach: one that reduces only
the spatial dimension of the full-order model, and one that reduces both the
spatial and temporal dimensions of the full-order model. For each type of trial
subspace, we consider two different solution techniques: direct (i.e.,
discretize then optimize) and indirect (i.e., optimize then discretize).
Numerical experiments conducted using trial subspaces characterized by spatial
dimension reduction demonstrate that the WLS approach can yield more accurate
solutions with lower space-time residuals than Galerkin and LSPG projection.

visible object in this binary, PTF J0533+0209B, is a $\approx 0.17\,M_\odot$
mass white dwarf with a helium-dominated atmosphere containing traces of
hydrogen (DBA). This object exhibits ellipsoidal variations due to tidal
deformation, and is the visible component in a single-lined spectroscopic
binary with a velocity semi-amplitude of $K_B=618.7\pm6.9 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$.
We have detected significant orbital decay due to the emission of gravitational
radiation, and we expect that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA)
will detect this system with a signal to noise of $8.4^{+4.2}_{-3.0}$ after
four years of operation. Because this system already has a well determined
orbital period, radial velocity semi-amplitude, temperature, atmospheric
composition, surface gravity, and orbital decay rate, a LISA signal will help
fully constrain the properties of this system by providing a direct measurement
of its inclination. Thus, this binary demonstrates the synergy between
electromagnetic and gravitational radiation for constraining the physical
properties of an astrophysical object.

learning tiered latent representations and latent spaces for molecular graphs
that explicitly represent and utilize groups (e.g., functional groups). This
enables the utilization and exploration of tiered molecular latent spaces,
either individually - the node (atom) tier, the group tier, or the graph
(molecule) tier - or jointly, as well as navigation across the tiers. In this
paper, we discuss the use of tiered graph autoencoders together with graph
prediction for molecular graphs. We show features of molecular graphs used, and
groups in molecular graphs identified for some sample molecules. We briefly
review graph prediction and the QM9 dataset for background information, and
discuss the use of tiered graph embeddings for graph prediction, particularly
weighted group pooling. We find that functional groups and ring groups
effectively capture and represent the chemical essence of molecular graphs
(structures). Further, tiered graph autoencoders and graph prediction together
provide effective, efficient and interpretable deep learning for molecular
graphs, with the former providing unsupervised, transferable learning and the
latter providing supervised, task-optimized learning.

  When the objective depends on the posterior belief through a set of moments,
the price function induces prices for posterior moments that solve the

focusing both the incoming long-wavelength radiation and the short-wavelength
pump laser field into the same active region. There, infrared active

polarizability to the pump field. This optomechanical interaction is enhanced
by the antenna and leads to the coherent transfer of the incoming low-frequency

demonstrate that our scheme is realizable with current technology and that
optimized platforms can reach single photon sensitivity in a spectral region

roles. Training a speaker classification system robust to speaker and channel
conditions is challenging due to inherent variability in the speech within
children and the adult interlocutors. In this work, we propose the use of
meta-learning, in particular, prototypical networks which optimize a metric

set as a separate task during meta-training, we learn a representation with
improved generalizability compared to conventional supervised learning. We
demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art speaker embeddings (x-vectors)
under two evaluation settings: weakly supervised classification (up to 14.53%

strong connections between stellar pulsations and the dust and molecular
chemistry in their circumstellar shells. A sharp boundary in overall dust
content, which predominantly measures the amount of amorphous carbon, separates
the semi-regular and Mira variables, with the semi-regulars showing little dust
in their spectra and the Miras showing more. In semi-regulars, the contribution
from SiC dust increases rapidly as the overall dust content grows, but in
Miras, the SiC dust feature grows weaker as more dust is added. A similar
dichotomy is found with the absorption band from CS at $\sim$7.3 $\mu$m, which
is generally limited to semi-regular variables. Observationally, these
differences make it straightforward to distinguish semi-regular and Mira
variables spectroscopically without the need for long-term photometric
observations or knowledge of their distances. The rapid onset of strong SiC
emission in Galactic carbon stars in semi-regulars variables points to a
different dust-condensation process before strong pulsations take over. The
break in the production of amorphous carbon between semi-regulars and Miras
seen in the Galactic sample is also evident in Magellanic carbon stars, linking
strong pulsations in carbon stars to the strong mass-loss rates which will end
their lives as stars across a wide range of metallicities.

challenging. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning technique to

that appears in vehicular channels. The channel measurements acquired with the

White and Black offenders can bring different predictors distributions to the

potential, $\mu$, using the complex-Langevin equation (CLE) with gauge-cooling
and adaptive updating. The CLE is used because QCD at finite finite $\mu$ has a
complex fermion determinant, which prevents use of standard simulation methods.
Simulations using the standard lattice action show a transition from hadronic
to nuclear matter for $\mu < m_\pi/2$ rather than the expected $\mu \approx
m_N/3$. This suggests that the CLE is being influenced by the phase-quenched
theory, which has a transition at $\mu = m_\pi/2$. We are therefore performing
CLE simulations with a new action which includes an irrelevant chiral 4-fermion
interaction. This separates the physics at energies of order of the pion mass
and smaller from that at energies of the other hadrons. In doing this, it
breaks the extended symmetry of the phase-quenched theory over that of the full
theory, raising the masses of the extra pion-like excitations consisting of a
quark and a conjugate quark, which could otherwise produce such an anomalous
transition. Our preliminary CLE simulations using massless quarks, so that
$m_\pi=0$, show no transition at $\mu=m_\pi/2=0$, but do show a transition at
an appreciably higher value of $\mu$. It remains to be seen if this transition
is near to $m_N/3$.

experimentally-observed zero-bias conductance peaks in
superconductor-semiconductor hybrid structures, we theoretically investigate
the tunneling conductance spectra in one-dimensional nanowires in proximity to
superconductors in a systematic manner taking into account several different
physical mechanisms producing zero-bias conductance peaks. The mechanisms we
consider are the presence of quantum dots, inhomogeneous potential, random
disorder in the chemical potential, random fluctuations in the superconducting
gap, and in the effective $g$ factor with the self-energy renormalization
induced by the parent superconductor in both short ($L\sim1~\mu$m) and long
nanowires ($L\sim3~\mu$m). We classify all foregoing theoretical results for
zero-bias conductance peaks into three types: the good, the bad, and the ugly,
according to the physical mechanisms producing the zero-bias peaks and their
topological properties. We find that, although the topological Majorana zero
modes are immune to weak disorder, strong disorder (ugly) completely suppresses
topological superconductivity and generically leads to trivial zero bias peaks.
Compared qualitatively with the extensive existing experimental results in the
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire structures, we conclude that most current
experiments are likely exploring trivial zero-bias peaks in the ugly situation
dominated by strong disorder. We also study the nonlocal end-to-end correlation
measurement in both the short and long wires, and point out the limitation of
the nonlocal correlation in ascertaining topological properties particularly
when applied to short wires. The goal of the work is to establish with a very
high confidence level the real physical possibility that essentially all
experimentally observed zero bias peaks in Majorana nanowires are most likely
ugly.

navigators (iNAVs) using an unrolled deep learning (DL) model for non-rigid
motion correction in coronary magnetic resonance angiography (CMRA).
  Methods: An unrolled network is trained to reconstruct beat-to-beat 3D iNAVs
acquired as part of a CMRA sequence. The unrolled model incorporates a
non-uniform FFT operator to perform the data consistency operation, and the
regularization term is learned by a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on
the proximal gradient descent algorithm. The training set includes 6,000 3D
iNAVs acquired from 7 different subjects and 11 scans using a variable-density
(VD) cones trajectory. For testing, 3D iNAVs from 4 additional subjects are
reconstructed using the unrolled model. To validate reconstruction accuracy,
global and localized motion estimates from DL model-based 3D iNAVs are compared
with those extracted from 3D iNAVs reconstructed with $\textit{l}_{1}$-ESPIRiT.
Then, the high-resolution coronary MRA images motion corrected with
autofocusing using the $\textit{l}_{1}$-ESPIRiT and DL model-based 3D iNAVs are
assessed for differences.
  Results: 3D iNAVs reconstructed using the DL model-based approach and
conventional $\textit{l}_{1}$-ESPIRiT generate similar global and localized
motion estimates and provide equivalent coronary image quality. Reconstruction
with the unrolled network completes in a fraction of the time compared to CPU
and GPU implementations of $\textit{l}_{1}$-ESPIRiT (20x and 3x speed
increases, respectively).
  Conclusion: We have developed a deep neural network architecture to
reconstruct undersampled 3D non-Cartesian VD cones iNAVs. Our approach
decreases reconstruction time for 3D iNAVs, while preserving the accuracy of
non-rigid motion information offered by them for correction.

the robustness of these systems against failures is of great interest. A main
line of theoretical pursuit has been percolation induced cascading failures,
where interdependence between network layers is conveniently and tacitly
assumed to be symmetric. In the real world, interdependent interactions are
generally asymmetric. To uncover and quantify the impact of asymmetry in
interdependence on network robustness, we focus on percolation dynamics in
double-layer systems and implement the following failure mechanism: once a node
in a network layer fails, the damage it can cause depends not only on its
position in the layer but also on the position of its counterpart neighbor in
the other layer. We find that the characteristics of the percolation transition
depend on the degree of asymmetry, where the striking phenomenon of a switch in
the nature of the phase transition from first- to second-order arises. We
derive a theory to calculate the percolation transition points in both network
layers, as well as the transition switching point, with strong numerical
support from synthetic and empirical networks. Not only does our work shed
light upon the factors that determine the robustness of multilayer networks
against cascading failures, but it also provides a scenario by which the system
can be designed or controlled to reach a desirable level of resilience.

attractors whose structure closely resembles the linear Tollmien-Schlichting
(TS) mode, and in particular exhibits strongly localized stress fluctuations at
the critical layer position of the TS mode. At the parameter values chosen,
this solution branch is not connected to the nonlinear TS solution branch found
for Newtonian flow, and thus represents a solution family that is nonlinearly
self-sustained by viscoelasticity. The ratio between stress and velocity
fluctuations is in quantitative agreement for the attractor and the linear TS
mode, and increases strongly with Weissenberg number, Wi. For the latter, there
is a transition in the scaling of this ratio as Wi increases, and the Wi at
which the nonlinear solution family comes into existence is just above this
transition. Finally, evidence indicates that this branch is connected through
an unstable solution branch to two-dimensional elastoinertial turbulence (EIT).
These results suggest that, in the parameter range considered here, the bypass
transition leading to EIT is mediated by nonlinear amplification and
self-sustenance of perturbations that excite the Tollmien-Schlichting mode.

learning systems. This is especially the case for many real-world tasks where
large scale annotated examples are either too expensive to acquire or
unavailable due to privacy or data access constraints. Weak supervision has
shown to be a good means to mitigate the scarcity of annotated data by
leveraging weak labels or injecting constraints from heuristic rules and/or
external knowledge sources. Social media has little labeled data but possesses
unique characteristics that make it suitable for generating weak supervision,
resulting in a new type of weak supervision, i.e., weak social supervision. In
this article, we illustrate how various aspects of social media can be used to
generate weak social supervision. Specifically, we use the recent research on
fake news detection as the use case, where social engagements are abundant but
annotated examples are scarce, to show that weak social supervision is
effective when facing the little labeled data problem. This article opens the
door for learning with weak social supervision for other emerging tasks.

interactions, e.g. opening doors, pressing buttons and pushing obstacles away.
This type of navigation tasks, which we call Interactive Navigation, requires
the use of mobile manipulators: mobile bases with manipulation capabilities.
Interactive Navigation tasks are usually long-horizon and composed of
heterogeneous phases of pure navigation, pure manipulation, and their
combination. Using the wrong part of the embodiment is inefficient and hinders
progress. We propose HRL4IN, a novel Hierarchical RL architecture for
Interactive Navigation tasks. HRL4IN exploits the exploration benefits of HRL
over flat RL for long-horizon tasks thanks to temporally extended commitments
towards subgoals. Different from other HRL solutions, HRL4IN handles the
heterogeneous nature of the Interactive Navigation task by creating subgoals in
different spaces in different phases of the task. Moreover, HRL4IN selects
different parts of the embodiment to use for each phase, improving energy
efficiency. We evaluate HRL4IN against flat PPO and HAC, a state-of-the-art HRL
algorithm, on Interactive Navigation in two environments - a 2D grid-world
environment and a 3D environment with physics simulation. We show that HRL4IN
significantly outperforms its baselines in terms of task performance and energy
efficiency. More information is available at

investigating the frequency of changes and how source code, build and test
changes co-evolve in mobile and non-mobile platforms. We developed regression
models to explain which factors influence the frequency of changes and applied
the Apriori algorithm to find types of changes that frequently co-occur. Our
findings show that non-mobile repositories have a higher number of commits per
month and our regression models suggest that being mobile significantly impacts
on the number of commits in a negative direction when controlling for confound
factors, such as code size. We also found that developers do not usually change
source code files together with build or test files. We argue that our results
can provide valuable information for developers on how changes are performed in
different platforms so that practices adopted in successful software systems

input graphs to capture their global properties, and they are fundamental for
building deep GNNs that learn hierarchical representations. In this work, we
propose the Node Decimation Pooling (NDP), a pooling operator for GNNs that
generates coarser graphs while preserving the overall graph topology. During
training, the GNN learns new node representations and fits them to a pyramid of
coarsened graphs, which is computed offline in a pre-processing stage. NDP
consists of three steps. First, a node decimation procedure selects the nodes
belonging to one side of the partition identified by a spectral algorithm that
approximates the \maxcut{} solution. Afterwards, the selected nodes are
connected with Kron reduction to form the coarsened graph. Finally, since the
resulting graph is very dense, we apply a sparsification procedure that prunes
the adjacency matrix of the coarsened graph to reduce the computational cost in
the GNN. Notably, we show that it is possible to remove many edges without
significantly altering the graph structure. Experimental results show that NDP
is more efficient compared to state-of-the-art graph pooling operators while
reaching, at the same time, competitive performance on a significant variety of
graph classification tasks.

radiation induced segregation tendencies in dilute ferritic alloys, by
computing the transport coefficients of each system based on ab initio
calculations of binding energies and migration rates. The implementation of the
self-consistent mean field method in the KineCluE code allows to extend the
calculation of transport coefficients to arbitrary interaction ranges, crystal
structures, and diffusion mechanisms. The results show that the diffusivity of
P, Mn, and Cr solute atoms is dominated by the dumbbell mechanism, that of Cu
by vacancies, while the two mechanisms might be in competition for Ni and Si,
despite the fact that the corresponding mixed dumbbells are not stable.
Systematic enrichment at defect sinks is expected for P and Mn solutes due to
dumbbell diffusion, and for Si due mainly to vacancy drag. Vacancy drag is also
responsible for Cu and Ni enrichment below 1085 K. The RIS behavior of Cr is
the outcome of a fine balance between dumbbell enrichment and vacancy
depletion. Therefore, for dilute Cr concentrations global enrichment occurs
below 540 K, and depletion above. This threshold temperature grows with solute
concentration. The findings are in agreement with experimental observations of
RIS and clustering phenomena, and confirm that solute-defect kinetic coupling
plays an important role in the formation of solute clusters in reactor pressure
vessel steels and other alloys.

classical n-gram LMs for language modeling due to their superior abilities to
model long-range dependencies in text and handle data sparsity problems. And
recently, well configured deep Transformers have exhibited superior performance
over shallow stack of recurrent neural network layers for language modeling.
However, these state-of-the-art deep Transformer models were mostly engineered
to be deep with high model capacity, which makes it computationally inefficient
and challenging to be deployed into large-scale real-world applications.
Therefore, it is important to develop Transformer LMs that have relatively
small model sizes, while still retaining good performance of those much larger
models. In this paper, we aim to conduct empirical study on training
Transformers with small parameter sizes in the context of ASR rescoring. By
combining techniques including subword units, adaptive softmax, large-scale
model pre-training, and knowledge distillation, we show that we are able to
successfully train small Transformer LMs with significant relative word error
rate reductions (WERR) through n-best rescoring. In particular, our experiments
on a video speech recognition dataset show that we are able to achieve WERRs
ranging from 6.46% to 7.17% while only with 5.5% to 11.9% parameter sizes of
the well-known large GPT model [1], whose WERR with rescoring on the same
dataset is 7.58%.

of fairness and accountability, we explore explicit subgroup sample complexity
bounds. The work is motivated by the observation that classifier predictions
for real world datasets often demonstrate drastically different metrics, such
as accuracy, when subdivided by specific sensitive variable subgroups. The
reasons for these discrepancies are varied and not limited to the influence of
mitigating variables, institutional bias, underlying population distributions
as well as sampling bias. Among the numerous definitions of fairness that
exist, we argue that at a minimum, principled ML practices should ensure that
classification predictions are able to mirror the underlying sub-population
distributions. However, as the number of sensitive variables increase,
populations meeting at the intersectionality of these variables may simply not
exist or may not be large enough to provide accurate samples for
classification. In these increasingly likely scenarios, we make the case for
human intervention and applying situational and individual definitions of
fairness. In this paper we present lower bounds of subgroup sample complexity
for metric-fair learning based on the theory of Probably Approximately Metric
Fair Learning. We demonstrate that for a classifier to approach a definition of
fairness in terms of specific sensitive variables, adequate subgroup population
samples need to exist and the model dimensionality has to be aligned with
subgroup population distributions. In cases where this is not feasible, we
propose an approach using individual fairness definitions for achieving
alignment. We look at two commonly explored UCI datasets under this lens and
suggest human interventions for data collection for specific subgroups to
achieve approximate individual fairness for linear hypotheses.

variability associated with the participants' speech and background conditions.
Further, scarcity of training data often restricts direct application of
conventional deep learning methods. In this work, we address two major sources
of variability - age of the child and data source collection location - using
domain adversarial learning which does not require labeled target domain data.
We use two methods, generative adversarial training with inverted label loss

NER and flat NER depending on whether named entities are nested or not. Models
are usually separately developed for the two tasks, since sequence labeling
models, the most widely used backbone for flat NER, are only able to assign a
single label to a particular token, which is unsuitable for nested NER where a
token may be assigned several labels.
  In this paper, we propose a unified framework that is capable of handling
both flat and nested NER tasks. Instead of treating the task of NER as a
sequence labeling problem, we propose to formulate it as a machine reading
comprehension (MRC) task. For example, extracting entities with the
\textsc{per} label is formalized as extracting answer spans to the question
""{\it which person is mentioned in the text?}"". This formulation naturally
tackles the entity overlapping issue in nested NER: the extraction of two
overlapping entities for different categories requires answering two
independent questions. Additionally, since the query encodes informative prior
knowledge, this strategy facilitates the process of entity extraction, leading
to better performances for not only nested NER, but flat NER.
  We conduct experiments on both {\em nested} and {\em flat} NER datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation.
We are able to achieve vast amount of performance boost over current SOTA

This is a fourth-order inverse problem, as we are trying to recover factors of

  We propose a solution to this problem using the recently introduced technique
of anchored regression. This approach uses two different types of convex
relaxations: we replace the quadratic equality constraints for the phaseless

through nuclear norm regularization. The result is a convex program that works
in the space of $d_1 \times d_2$ matrices.
  We analyze two specific scenarios. In the first, the target matrix is
rank-$1$, and the observations are structured to correspond to a phaseless
blind deconvolution. In the second, the target matrix has general rank, and we
observe the magnitudes of the inner products against a series of independent
Gaussian random matrices. In each of these problems, we show that the anchored
regression returns an accurate estimate from a near-optimal number of
measurements given that we have access to an anchor matrix of sufficient
quality. We also show how to create such an anchor in the phaseless blind
deconvolution problem, again from an optimal number of measurements, and
present a partial result in this direction for the general rank problem.

and inertial sensor data have been proposed over the years. In most of the
existing works, fusion is performed at a single level (feature level or
decision level), missing the opportunity to fuse rich mid-level features
necessary for better classification. To address this shortcoming, in this
paper, we propose three novel deep multilevel multimodal fusion frameworks to
capitalize on different fusion strategies at various stages and to leverage the
superiority of multilevel fusion. At input, we transform the depth data into
depth images called sequential front view images (SFIs) and inertial sensor
data into signal images. Each input modality, depth and inertial, is further
made multimodal by taking convolution with the Prewitt filter. Creating
""modality within modality"" enables further complementary and discriminative
feature extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are
trained on input images of each modality to learn low-level, high-level and
complex features. Learned features are extracted and fused at different stages
of the proposed frameworks to combine discriminative and complementary
information. These highly informative features are served as input to a
multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM). We evaluate the proposed frameworks
on three publicly available multimodal HAR datasets, namely, UTD Multimodal

in order to determine the treatment effects of interventions which impact
climate change, such as deforestation. Simply put, the aim is to quantify the
'before versus after' effect of climate related human driven interventions,
such as urbanization; as well as natural disasters, such as hurricanes and
forest fires. As a concrete example, we focus on quantifying forest tree cover
change/ deforestation due to human led causes. The proposed method involves the
following steps. First, we uae computer vision and machine learning/deep
learning techniques to detect and quantify forest tree coverage levels over
time, at every time epoch. We then look at this time series to identify
changepoints. Next, we estimate the expected (forest tree cover) values using a
Bayesian structural causal model and projecting/forecasting the counterfactual.
This is compared to the values actually observed post intervention, and the
difference in the two values gives us the effect of the intervention (as
compared to the non intervention scenario, i.e. what would have possibly
happened without the intervention). As a specific use case, we analyze
deforestation levels before and after the hyperinflation event (intervention)
in Brazil (which ended in 1993-94), for the Amazon rainforest region, around
Rondonia, Brazil. For this deforestation use case, using our causal inference
framework can help causally attribute change/reduction in forest tree cover and
increasing deforestation rates due to human activities at various points in
time.

item-to-item recommendation, news category classification, news popularity

a fast and effective model to enhance arbitrary document representation with a

aggregating information from their neighborhood in the knowledge graph. Then a
context embedding layer is applied to annotate the dynamic context of different

distillation layer aggregates the entity embeddings under the guidance of the
original document representation and transforms the document vector into a new

image composition tasks, image blending aims to seamlessly blend an object from
a source image onto a target image with lightly mask adjustment. A popular
approach is Poisson image blending, which enforces the gradient domain
smoothness in the composite image. However, this approach only considers the
boundary pixels of target image, and thus can not adapt to texture of target

proposed Poisson blending loss as well as the style and content loss computed

ML algorithm for accurate facial landmarks localization in photographs of
facial palsy patients, and use it as part of an automated computer-aided
diagnosis system. Design, Setting, and Participants: Facial landmarks were
manually localized in portrait photographs of eight expressions obtained from
200 facial palsy patients and 10 controls. A novel ML model for automated
facial landmark localization was trained using this disease-specific database.
Model output was compared to manual annotations and the output of a model
trained using a larger database consisting only of healthy subjects. Model
accuracy was evaluated by the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) between
algorithms' prediction and manual annotations. Results: Publicly available
algorithms provide poor results when applied to patients compared to healthy
controls (NRMSE, 8.56 +/- 2.16 vs. 7.09 +/- 2.34, p << 0.01). We found
significant improvement in facial landmark localization accuracy for the
clinical population when using a model trained with a relatively small number

more images of healthy faces (NRMSE, 6.03 +/- 2.43 vs. 8.56 +/- 2.16, p <<

addition, the potential similarities between the training and test data lead to
a serious problem of model overfitting. In this paper, we investigate changes
in performance when applying disease diagnosis systems to different scenarios

sequences to resonate, they do not necessarily have to be identical. Therefore,
the existence of sequences differing in the primary sequence but having similar
resonating sub-structures was proposed. It was hypothesized that such
sequences, named HIDERs, would be enriched in the genomes of multicellular
species. Specifically, it was hypothesized that delocalized electron clouds of
purine-pyrimidine sequences could serve as the basis of HIDERs. The consequent
genomic analysis confirmed the enrichment of purine-pyrimidine HIDERs in a few
selected genomes of mammals, an insect, and a plant, compared to randomized
sequence controls. Similarly, it was suggested that hypothetical delocalized
proton clouds of the hydrogen bonds of multiple stacked bases could serve as
sequence-dependent hydrogen-bond-based HIDERs. Similarly, the enrichment of

of several motor and non-motor symptoms. During diagnosis, gait abnormalities
are among the important symptoms that physicians should consider. However, gait
evaluation is challenging and relies on the expertise and subjectivity of
clinicians. In this context, the use of an intelligent gait analysis algorithm
may assist physicians in order to facilitate the diagnosis process. This paper
proposes a novel intelligent Parkinson detection system based on deep learning
techniques to analyze gait information. We used 1D convolutional neural network
(1D-Convnet) to build a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier. The proposed
model processes 18 1D-signals coming from foot sensors measuring the vertical
ground reaction force (VGRF). The first part of the network consists of 18
parallel 1D-Convnet corresponding to system inputs. The second part is a fully
connected network that connects the concatenated outputs of the 1D-Convnets to
obtain a final classification. We tested our algorithm in Parkinson's detection
and in the prediction of the severity of the disease with the Unified
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Our experiments demonstrate the high
efficiency of the proposed method in the detection of Parkinson disease based
on gait data. The proposed algorithm achieved an accuracy of 98.7 %. To our
knowledge, this is the state-of-the-start performance in Parkinson's gait
recognition. Furthermore, we achieved an accuracy of 85.3 % in Parkinson's
severity prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm
to perform a severity prediction based on the UPDRS. Our results show that the

  Dataset Matters",,,,,"cs.DC math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To gain a better performance, many researchers put more computing resource
into an application. However, in the AI area, there is still a lack of a
successful large-scale machine learning training application: The scalability
and performance reproducibility of parallel machine learning training algorithm
are limited and there are a few pieces of research focusing on why these
indexes are limited but there are very few research efforts explaining the
reasons in essence. In this paper, we propose that the sample difference in
dataset plays a more prominent role in parallel machine learning algorithm
scalability. Dataset characters can measure sample difference. These characters
include the variance of the sample in a dataset, sparsity, sample diversity and
similarity in sampling sequence. To match our proposal, we choose four kinds of
parallel machine learning training algorithms as our research objects: (1)
Asynchronous parallel SGD algorithm (Hogwild! algorithm) (2) Parallel model
average SGD algorithm (Mini-batch SGD algorithm) (3) Decenterilization
optimization algorithm, (4) Dual Coordinate Optimization (DADM algorithm).
These algorithms cover different types of machine learning optimization
algorithms. We present the analysis of their convergence proof and design
experiments. Our results show that the characters datasets decide the
scalability of the machine learning algorithm. What is more, there is an upper
bound of parallel scalability for machine learning algorithms.

Ba3TiTe5 and the high-pressure induced superconductivity therein. Ba3TiTe5 was
synthesized at high pressure and high temperature. It crystallizes into a
hexagonal structure (P63/mcm), which consists of infinite face-sharing
octahedral TiTe6 chains and Te chains along the c axis, exhibiting a strong 1D
characteristic structure. The first-principles calculations demonstrate that
Ba3TiTe5 is a well-defined 1D conductor and thus, it can be considered a
starting point to explore the exotic physics induced by pressure via enhancing
the interchain hopping to move the 1D conductor to a high dimensional metal.
For Ba3TiTe5, high-pressure techniques were employed to study the emerging
physics dependent on interchain hopping, such as the Umklapp scattering effect,
spin/charge density wave (SDW/CDW), superconductivity and non-Fermi Liquid
behavior. Finally, a complete phase diagram was plotted. The superconductivity
emerges from 8.8 GPa, near which the Umklapp gap is mostly suppressed. Tc is
enhanced and reaches the maximum ~6 K at about 36.7 GPa, where the spin/charge
density wave (SDW/CDW) is completely suppressed, and a non-Fermi Liquid
behavior appears. Our results suggest that the appearance of superconductivity
is associated with the fluctuation due to the suppression of Umklapp gap and
the enhancement of Tc is related with the fluctuation of the SDW/CDW.

initial sticking probabilities (S0) of H2 on Cu(111) and D2O on Ni(111),
revealing distinct quantum nature in the two benchmark surface reactions.
NE-RPMD successfully captures quantum tunneling in H2 dissociation at very low

Additionally, QCT substantially overestimates S0 of D2O due to severe zero

Recently, some methods have been proposed for remote HR estimation from face

generalization ability into less-constrained scenarios (e.g., with head
movement, and bad illumination) are not known. At the same time, lacking

estimation from the face. In RyhthmNet, we use a spatial-temporal
representation encoding the HR signals from multiple ROI volumes as its input.
Then the spatial-temporal representations are fed into a convolutional network
for HR estimation. We also take into account the relationship of adjacent HR
measurements from a video sequence via Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and achieves
efficient HR measurement. In addition, we build a large-scale multi-modal HR

to circumvent the phase fluctuations and polarization rotations in optical
fibres. Recently, it has been shown that the use of a counter-propagating
coherent light as an ancillary photon enables us to faithfully distribute
entangled photon with success probability proportional to the transmittance of
the optical fibres. Several proof-of-principle experiments have been
demonstrated, in which entangled photon pairs from a sender side and the
ancillary photon from a receiver side originate from the same laser source. In
addition, bulk optics have been used to mimic the noises in optical fibres.
Here, we demonstrate a DFS-based entanglement distribution over 1km-optical
fibre using DFS formed by using fully independent light sources at the telecom
band. In the experiment, we utilize an interference between asynchronous
photons from cw-pumped spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) and
mode-locked coherent light pulse. After performing spectral and temporal
filtering, the SPDC photons and light pulse are spectrally indistinguishable.
This property allows us to observe high-visibility interference without

monographs; 2) the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) of the system,
pointing out the differences between that in linear response theory (LRT)
assuming ultra-weak coupling between the system and the bath, and the FDR in an
equilibrated final state, relaxed from the nonequilibrium evolution of an open
quantum system; 3) quantum radiation from an atom interacting with a quantum
field: Begin with vacuum fluctuations in the field acting on the internal
degrees of freedom (idf) of an atom, adding to its dynamics a stochastic
component which engenders quantum radiation whose backreaction causes quantum
dissipation in the idf of the atom. For a stationary atom, we show how the
absence of radiation results from complex cancellations, at a faraway
observation point, of the interference between emitted radiation from the atom
and the local fluctuations in the free field. We point out that the entity
which enters into the duality relation with vacuum fluctuations is not
classical radiation reaction, but quantum dissipation. Finally, regarding Issue
2, for systems with many atoms, the existence of a set of
correlation-propagation relations shows how the correlations between the atoms
are related to the propagation of their mutual influence manifesting in the
quantum field. The CPR is absolutely crucial in keeping the balance of energy
flows between the constituents of the system, and between the system and its
environment. Without the consideration of this additional relation in tether
with the FDR, dynamical self-consistency cannot be sustained. Combination of
these two sets of relations capture the physical essence of the interaction
between an atom and a quantum field.

the eigenstate of the OAM operator in the confined geometry. Inspired by

network. These similarity measures turn out to be an important fundamental tool
for many real world applications such as link prediction in networks,
recommender systems etc. An important class of similarity measures are local
similarity measures. Two nodes are considered similar under local similarity
measures if they have large overlap between their neighboring set of nodes.
Manipulating node similarity measures via removing edges is an important
problem. This type of manipulation, for example, hinders effectiveness of link
prediction in terrorists networks. Fortunately, all the popular computational
problems formulated around manipulating similarity measures turn out to be
NP-hard. We, in this paper, provide fine grained complexity results of these
problems through the lens of parameterized complexity. In particular, we show
that some of these problems are fixed parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to
various natural parameters whereas other problems remain intractable W[1]-hard
and W[2]-hard in particular). Finally we show the effectiveness of our proposed
FPT algorithms on real world datasets as well as synthetic networks generated
using Barabasi-Albert and Erdos-Renyi models.

pose information and contour keypoints containing human shape information. TRB
not only preserves the flexibility of skeleton keypoint representation, but
also contains rich pose and human shape information. Therefore, it promises
broader application areas, such as human shape editing and conditional image

patterns of brain connectivity mechanism using neuroimaging techniques.
Conventional GCA applies two different mathematical theories in a two-stage
scheme: (1) the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) or Akaike information
criterion (AIC) for the regression model orders associated with endogenous and
exogenous information; (2) F-statistics for determining the causal effects of
exogenous variables. While specifying endogenous and exogenous effects are
essentially the same model selection problem, this could produce different
benchmarks in the two stages and therefore degrade the performance of GCA. In
this course, we present a unified model selection approach based on the minimum
description length (MDL) principle for GCA in the context of the general
regression model paradigm. Compared with conventional methods, our approach
emphasize that a single mathematical theory should be held throughout the GCA
process. Under this framework, all candidate models within the model space
might be compared freely in the context of the code length, without the need
for an intermediate model. We illustrate its advantages over conventional
two-stage GCA approach in a 3-node network and a 5-node network synthetic
experiments. The unified model selection approach is capable of identifying the
actual connectivity while avoiding the false influences of noise. More
importantly, the proposed approach obtained more consistent results in a
challenge fMRI dataset for causality investigation, mental calculation network
under visual and auditory stimulus, respectively. The proposed approach has
potential to accommodate other Granger causality representations in other
function space. The comparison between different GC representations in
different function spaces can also be naturally deal with in the framework.

hexalithiobenzene with an alkali atom using density functional theory. All
MC6Li6 complexes are planar and stable against dissociation into M + C6Li6
fragments, irrespective of their charge. These complexes are stabilized by
charge transfer from M to C6Li6, although the back-donation of charges tends to
destabilize neutral species. Furthermore, their degree of aromaticity increases
monotonically from M = Li to K, unlike MC6Li6+ cations, which are not aromatic
as suggested by their NICS values. The adiabatic ionization energies of MC6Li6
(3.08-3.22 eV) and vertical electron affinities of MC6Li6+ (3.04-3.15 eV)
suggest that MC6Li6 species form a new series of aromatic superalkalis. The
variation of the ionization energy of MC6Li6 is found to be in accordance with
the NICS values of MC6Li6+. The superalkali nature of MC6Li6 and its relation

significant partial correlations with both $M_{\mathrm{H_2}}$ and
$M_\mathrm{HI}$. This hints at the importance of environment (e.g.,
galactocentric distance) on the gas content of galaxies and the interplay
between gas and SFR. We fit multiple regression to summarize the median, mean,
and the $0.15/0.85$ quantile multivariate relationships among

interest across multiple surveillance camera views. In person

which incurs ambiguity to distinguish different pedestrians and degrades the
accuracy. To this end, we propose an end-to-end foreground-aware network to
discriminate foreground from background by learning a soft mask for person

supervision for foreground, we introduce the camera ID of each pedestrian image
for background modeling. The foreground branch and the background branch are
optimized collaboratively. By presenting a target attention loss, the
pedestrian features extracted from the foreground branch become more
insensitive to the backgrounds, which greatly reduces the negative impacts of
changing backgrounds on matching an identical across different camera views.
Notably, in contrast to existing methods, our approach does not require any
additional dataset to train a human landmark detector or a segmentation model
for locating the background regions. The experimental results conducted on

boundary components parametrized by the punctured formal disk. We study the
moduli space of nodal framed formal curves, which we endow with a logarithmic
structure. We show that this moduli space is a smooth formal logarithmic stack.
The remarkable property of our construction is that framed formal curves admit
a natural operation of ""gluing along the boundary"" which works well in families
and preserves smoothness (both in a formal and in a logarithmic sense), and
this induces gluing maps on the level of moduli.
  Using moduli spaces of framed formal curves we enhance the operad E2 of
little disks (as well as its cousin, the framed little disks operad) to a fully
log motivic operad. We use this structure to obtain a purely algebro-geometric
proof of the formality of chains on these classical operads (initially proven
for little disks by Tamarkin using analytic methods). We also recover and
extend the known Galois action on the l-adic cohomology of framed and unframed
little disks, and on Drinfeld associators, and extend it to the action on
integral chains of a larger group scheme: the logarithmic motivic Galois group.
Our methods generalize to a higher genus context, giving new ""motivic""
enrichments (for example, action by the absolute Galois group and by the log
motivic Galois group) on the operad of chains in the oriented geometric bordism
operad of Ayala and Lurie, which encodes the algebraic structure on the
Hochschild cochains of any fully dualizable DG category.

pattern classification problems, but a huge bottleneck encountered is the slow
speed and poor performance of the traditional iterative gradient-based learning
algorithms. Although the famous extreme learning machine (ELM) has successfully
addressed the problems of slow convergence, it still has computational
robustness problems brought by input weights and biases randomly assigned.
Thus, in order to overcome the aforementioned problems, in this paper, a novel
type neural network based on Gegenbauer orthogonal polynomials, termed as GNN,
is constructed and investigated. This model could overcome the computational
robustness problems of ELM, while still has comparable structural simplicity
and approximation capability. Based on this, we propose a regularized weights
direct determination (R-WDD) based on equality-constrained optimization to
determine the optimal output weights. The R-WDD tends to minimize the empirical
risks and structural risks of the network, thus to lower the risk of over
fitting and improve the generalization ability. This leads us to a the final
GNN with R-WDD, which is a unified learning mechanism for binary and
multi-class classification problems. Finally, as is verified in the various
comparison experiments, GNN with R-WDD tends to have comparable (or even
better) generalization performances, computational scalability and efficiency,
and classification robustness, compared to least square support vector machine
(LS-SVM), ELM with Gaussian kernel.

domains like machine translation. However, due to the autoregressive
factorization nature, these models suffer from heavy latency during inference.
Recently, non-autoregressive sequence models were proposed to reduce the
inference time. However, these models assume that the decoding process of each
token is conditionally independent of others. Such a generation process
sometimes makes the output sentence inconsistent, and thus the learned
non-autoregressive models could only achieve inferior accuracy compared to
their autoregressive counterparts. To improve then decoding consistency and
reduce the inference cost at the same time, we propose to incorporate a
structured inference module into the non-autoregressive models. Specifically,
we design an efficient approximation for Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for
non-autoregressive sequence models, and further propose a dynamic transition
technique to model positional contexts in the CRF. Experiments in machine
translation show that while increasing little latency (8~14ms), our model could
achieve significantly better translation performance than previous
non-autoregressive models on different translation datasets. In particular, for
the WMT14 En-De dataset, our model obtains a BLEU score of 26.80, which largely
outperforms the previous non-autoregressive baselines and is only 0.61 lower in

MHD waves are proposed to transport sufficient energy from the
photosphere to heat the transition-region (TR) and corona. However, various
aspects of these waves such as their nature, propagation characteristics and
role in the atmospheric heating process remain poorly understood and are a
matter of further investigation. Aims. We aim to investigate wave propagation
within an active-region (AR) plage using IRIS and AIA observations. The main
motivation is to understand the relationship between photospheric and TR
oscillations. We plan to identify the locations in the plage region where
magnetic flux tubes are essentially vertical, and further our understanding of
the propagation and nature of these waves. Methods. We have used photospheric
observations from AIA (i.e., AIA 1700 {\AA}) as well as TR imaging observations
(IRIS/SJI Si iv 1400.0 {\AA}). We have investigated propagation of the waves
into the TR from the photosphere using wavelet analysis (e.g., cross power,
coherence and phase difference) with inclusion of a customized noise model.
Results. Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) shows the distribution of wave power at
photospheric & TR heights. Waves with periods between 2.0- and 9.0-minutes
appear to be correlated between the photosphere and TR. We exploited a
customized noise model to estimate 95% confidence levels for IRIS observations.
On the basis of the sound speed in the TR and estimated propagation speed,
these waves are best interpreted as the slow magneto acoustic waves (SMAW). It
is found that almost all locations show correlation/propagation of waves over
broad range of period from photosphere to TR. It suggests the wave's
correlation/propagation spatial occurrence frequency is very high within the
plage area.

induces changes in mobility behaviour as well as vehicle ownership patterns
that could have positive environmental impacts. This study contributes to the
understanding of the total mobility-related greenhouse gas emissions reduction
related to business-to-consumer car-sharing participation. A comprehensive
model which takes into account distances travelled annually by the major urban
transport modes as well as their life-cycle emissions factors is proposed, and
the before-and-after analysis is conducted for an average car-sharing member in
three geographical cases (Netherlands, San Francisco, Calgary). In addition to
non-operational emissions for all the transport modes involved, this approach
considers the rebound effects associated with the modal shift effect
(substituting driving distances with alternative modes) and the lifetime shift
effect for the shared automobiles, phenomena which have been barely analysed in
the previous studies. As a result, in contrast to the previous impact
assessments in the field, a significantly more modest reduction of the annual
total mobility-related life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions caused by
car-sharing participation has been estimated, 3-18% for three geographical case
studies investigated (versus up to 67% estimated previously). This suggests the
significance of the newly considered effects and provides with the practical
implications for improved assessments in the future.

evacuations, an evacuee is represented by a $1 \times 1$ square. However, a
rectangle ($1 \times 2$) representation is more suitable for such models than
the square representation because of evacuees' shoulder width. The rectangle
representation gives two new features to evacuees' behaviors: moving sideways

dynamics. Hence, we constructed a cellular automaton model where evacuees whose
shoulder widths are $1 \times 2$ try to escape from a room in an emergency
situation. The simulation results showed that turning behavior can make the
evacuation time shorter and there is an optimal turning rate for the crowd
evacuation. Our findings contribute to the effective control of evacuees in
emergency situations.

existing tools are built around a tabular data model, creating an impedance
mismatch for both the engine and the query interface. In contrast, Rumble uses
JSONiq, a standardized language specifically designed for querying JSON
documents. The key challenge in the design and implementation of Rumble is
mapping the recursive structure of JSON documents and JSONiq queries onto
Spark's execution primitives based on tabular data frames. Our solution is to
translate a JSONiq expression into a tree of iterators that dynamically switch
between local and distributed execution modes depending on the nesting level.
By overcoming the impedance mismatch in the engine, Rumble frees the user from
solving the same problem for every single query, thus increasing their
productivity considerably. As we show in extensive experiments, Rumble is able
to scale to large and complex data sets in the terabyte range with a similar or
better performance than other engines. The results also illustrate that Codd's
concept of data independence makes as much sense for heterogeneous, nested data
sets as it does on highly structured tables.

  We show that the question of termination can be reduced to the existential
fragment of the first-order theory of $\mathcal{S}$. For loops over

$\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$, it proves semi-decidability of non-termination.
  Furthermore, we present a transformation to convert certain non-twn-loops

terminates over a specific subset of $\mathbb{R}$, which can also be checked
via our reduction. Moreover, we formalize a technique to linearize (the updates
of) twn-loops in our setting and analyze its complexity. Based on these
results, we prove complexity bounds for the termination problem of twn-loops as
well as tight bounds for two important classes of loops which can always be
transformed into twn-loops.
  Finally, we show that there is an important class of linear loops where our
decision procedure results in an efficient procedure for termination analysis,

Relying on the haloscope technique, our strategy is to run several experiments
in parallel to explore a wide range of axion masses with sensitivities better
than the QCD axion models. We utilize not only the advanced technologies, such
as high-field large-volume superconducting (SC) magnets, ultra low temperature
dilution refrigerators, and nearly quantum-limited noise amplifiers, but also
some unique features solely developed at the Center, including high-quality SC
resonant cavities surviving high magnetic fields and efficient cavity
geometries to reach high-frequency regions. Our goal is to probe axion dark
matter in the frequency range of 1-10 GHz in the first phase and then
ultimately up to 25 GHz, even in a scenario where axions constitute only 10% of
the local dark matter halo. In this report, the current status and future
prospects of the experiments and R&D activities at IBS/CAPP are described.

signal into its appliance components. Such method can be harnessed to provide
various services to better manage and control energy consumption (optimal
planning and saving). NILM has been traditionally approached from signal
processing and electrical engineering perspectives. Recently, machine learning
has started to play an important role in NILM. While most work has focused on
supervised algorithms, unsupervised approaches can be more interesting and of
practical use in real case scenarios. Specifically, they do not require
labelled training data to be acquired from individual appliances and the
algorithm can be deployed to operate on the measured aggregate data directly.
In this paper, we propose a fully unsupervised NILM framework based on Bayesian
hierarchical mixture models. In particular, we develop a new method based on
Gaussian Latent Dirichlet Allocation (GLDA) in order to extract global
components that summarise the energy signal. These components provide a
representation of the consumption patterns. Designed to cope with big data, our
algorithm, unlike existing NILM ones, does not focus on appliance recognition.
To handle this massive data, GLDA works online. Another novelty of this work
compared to the existing NILM is that the data involves different utilities
(e.g, electricity, water and gas) as well as some sensors measurements.
Finally, we propose different evaluation methods to analyse the results which
show that our algorithm finds useful patterns.

resort to some approximation. We propose explicit approximations of the

objects, such as points, lines, planes, infinite cylinders, spheres, coordinate

Therefore, simple operators are used to represent those objects in different

scenario, where each agent can only observe the actions of some neighbors,
while its cost possibly depends on the strategies of other agents. Our main
contribution is the design of a fully-distributed, single-layer, fixed-step
algorithm, based on a proximal best-response augmented with consensus terms. To
derive our algorithm, we follow an operator-theoretic approach. First, we
recast the Nash equilibrium problem as that of finding a zero of a monotone
operator. Then, we demonstrate that the resulting inclusion can be solved in a
fully-distributed way via a proximal-point method, thanks to the use of a novel
preconditioning matrix. Under strong monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity of
the game mapping, We prove linear convergence of our algorithm to a Nash
equilibrium. Furthermore, we show that our method outperforms the fastest known
gradient-based schemes, both in terms of guaranteed convergence rate, via
theoretical analysis, and in practice, via numerical simulations.

simply computing event prototypes by averaging, which only consume event

information from event mentions for multiple times due to the multi-hop
mechanism of DMNs. The experiments show that DMB-PN not only deals with sample
scarcity better than a series of baseline models but also performs more
robustly when the variety of event types is relatively large and the instance

between different gas phases and star formation, and the influence of gas
stripping, gas heating, and AGN. We analyze the physical origin of the emission
at different wavelengths in the tail, in particular in-situ star formation
(related to Halpha, CO and UV emission), synchrotron emission from relativistic
electrons (producing the radio continuum) and heating of the stripped
interstellar medium (ISM) (responsible for the X-ray emission). We show the
similarities and differences of the spatial distributions of ionized gas,
molecular gas and UV light, and argue that the mismatch on small scales (1kpc)
is due to different stages of the star formation process. We present the
relation Halpha--X-ray surface brightness, which is steeper for star-forming
regions than for diffuse ionised gas regions with high [OI]/Halpha ratio. We
propose that ISM heating due to interaction with the intracluster medium
(either for mixing, thermal conduction or shocks) is responsible for the X-ray
tail, the observed [OI]-excess and the lack of star formation in the northern
part of the tail. We also report the tentative discovery in the tail of the

different error distributions, and that the Bayesian neural network we tested

to obey a replicator dynamics with a non-linear fitness that is induced by
environmental changes. The non-linear terms in the fitness emerge due to
populations tracking their time-dependent environment. These terms can induce a
stable polymorphism, though they do not spoil the polymorphism that exists
already without them. In this sense polymorphic populations are more robust
with respect to their time-dependent environments. The overall fitness of the
problem is still given by its time-averaged value, but the emergence of
polymorphism during genetic selection can be accompanied by decreasing mean

approximation in Hilbert spaces $L^{2}(\mu)$, with $\mu$ a compactly supported
measure in the complex plane, in terms of properties of the associated moment
matrix to the measure $\mu$. In order to do it, in the more general context of
Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices we introduce three indexes
$\gamma(\mathbf{M})$, $\lambda(\mathbf{M})$ and $\alpha(\mathbf{M})$ associated
with different optimization problems concerning these matrices. Our main result
is a characterization of density of polynomials in the case of measures
supported on Jordan curves with non empty interior using the index $\gamma$ and
other specific index related to it. Moreover, we provide a new point of view of
bounded point evaluations associated to a measure in terms of the index
$\gamma$ that will allow us to give an alternative proof of Thomson's theorem
in \cite{Brennan} by using these matrix indexes. We point out that our
techniques are based in matrix algebra tools in the frame of Hermitian Positive
Definite matrices and in the computation of certain indexes related to some
optimization problems for infinite matrices.

a lot of attention nowadays; the special focus is on magnetic topological
insulators (MTIs) featuring quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulator phases.
Feasibility of many novel phenomena that \emph{intrinsic} magnetic TIs may host
depends crucially on our ability to engineer and efficiently tune their
electronic and magnetic structures. Here, using angle- and spin-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy along with \emph{ab initio} calculations we report
on a large family of intrinsic magnetic TIs in the homologous series of the van
der Waals compounds (MnBi$_2$Te$_4$)(Bi$_2$Te$_3$)$_m$ with $m=0, ..., 6$.
Magnetic, electronic and, consequently, topological properties of these
materials depend strongly on the $m$ value and are thus highly tunable. The
antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling between the neighboring Mn layers strongly
weakens on moving from MnBi2Te4 (m=0) to MnBi4Te7 (m=1), changes to
ferromagnetic (FM) one in MnBi6Te10 (m=2) and disappears with further increase
in m. In this way, the AFM and FM TI states are respectively realized in the
$m=0,1$ and $m=2$ cases, while for $m \ge 3$ a novel and hitherto-unknown
topologically-nontrivial phase arises, in which below the corresponding
critical temperature the magnetizations of the non-interacting 2D ferromagnets,
formed by the \MBT\, building blocks, are disordered along the third direction.
The variety of intrinsic magnetic TI phases in
(MnBi$_2$Te$_4$)(Bi$_2$Te$_3$)$_m$ allows efficient engineering of functional
van der Waals heterostructures for topological quantum computation, as well as
antiferromagnetic and 2D spintronics.

increasing attention recently, due to its practical significance. Motivated by
the fact that human usually attend to the difference when they compare two
similar objects, we propose a dual-path cross-modality feature learning
framework which preserves intrinsic spatial strictures and attends to the
difference of input cross-modality image pairs. Our framework is composed by
two main components: a Dual-path Spatial-structure-preserving Common Space
Network (DSCSN) and a Contrastive Correlation Network (CCN). The former embeds
cross-modality images into a common 3D tensor space without losing spatial
structures, while the latter extracts contrastive features by dynamically
comparing input image pairs. Note that the representations generated for the
input RGB and Infrared images are mutually dependant to each other. We conduct
extensive experiments on two public available RGB-IR ReID datasets, SYSU-MM01
and RegDB, and our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by a
large margin with both full and simplified evaluation modes.

thermal management. Nanophotonic structures enabling broadband reflection lead
to minimization of sunlight absorption, which has brought nighttime-limited
radiative cooling into daytime applications. However, this broadband reflection
strategy in turn restricts the accessible colorization of radiative coolers to
white or neutral, consequently hindering their practical applications,
particularly for aesthetic purposes. With a few exceptions, selective
absorption at a specific visible wavelength has been the most prevalent
paradigm for colorization of radiative coolers. However, this absorption-based
colorization inevitably make the radiative cooler prone to heating, thus
decreasing the cooling efficiency. Here, we demonstrate an undiscovered usage
of opals for advancing color-preserved daytime radiative coolers. Opals, which
have served mainly as Bragg reflective color pigments thus far, can be
considered an effective homogeneous medium in the mid-infrared region. Thus,
opals can also be envisioned as reflectively colorful metamaterials capable of
radiative cooling even under the direct summer sun. Together with the soft
fluidity of colloidal suspensions, opals can serve as platforms for
easy-to-craft, large-scale, and colorful radiative coolers with minimal solar
absorption.

formation under the hypothesis of mutual consent in link formation. The
introduction of consent in link formation imposes a coordination problem in the

theory and the various methodologies to avoid the main pitfalls. The main
insight originates from Myerson's work on mutual consent in link formation and
his main conclusion that the empty network (the network without any links)
always emerges as a strong Nash equilibrium in any game-theoretic model of
network formation under mutual consent and positive link formation costs.
Jackson and Wolinsky introduced a cooperative framework to avoid this main
pitfall. They devised the notion of a pairwise stable network to arrive at
equilibrium networks that are mainly non-trivial. Unfortunately, this notion of
pairwise stability requires coordinated action by pairs of decision makers in
link formation. I survey the possible solutions in a purely non-cooperative
framework of network formation under mutual consent by exploring potential
refinements of the standard Nash equilibrium concept to explain the emergence
of non-trivial networks. This includes the notions of unilateral and monadic
stability. The first one is founded on advanced rational reasoning of
individuals about how others would respond to one's efforts to modify the
network. The latter incorporates trusting, boundedly rational behaviour into
the network formation process. The survey is concluded with an initial
exploration of external correlation devices as an alternative framework to
address mutual consent in network formation.

  Reclamation",,,"10.1145/3371136",,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the verification of lock-free data structures that manually
manage their memory with the help of a safe memory reclamation (SMR) algorithm.
Our first contribution is a type system that checks whether a program properly
manages its memory. If the type check succeeds, it is safe to ignore the SMR
algorithm and consider the program under garbage collection. Intuitively, our
types track the protection of pointers as guaranteed by the SMR algorithm.
There are two design decisions. The type system does not track any shape
information, which makes it extremely lightweight. Instead, we rely on
invariant annotations that postulate a protection by the SMR. To this end, we
introduce angels, ghost variables with an angelic semantics. Moreover, the SMR
algorithm is not hard-coded but a parameter of the type system definition. To
achieve this, we rely on a recent specification language for SMR algorithms.
Our second contribution is to automate the type inference and the invariant
check. For the type inference, we show a quadratic-time algorithm. For the
invariant check, we give a source-to-source translation that links our programs
to off-the-shelf verification tools. It compiles away the angelic semantics.
This allows us to infer appropriate annotations automatically in a
guess-and-check manner. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our type-based
verification approach, we check linearizability for various list and set
implementations from the literature with both hazard pointers and epoch-based
memory reclamation. For many of the examples, this is the first time they are
verified automatically. For the ones where there is a competitor, we obtain a
speed-up of up to two orders of magnitude.

the present paper, we assume that the truncated Riesz space $E$ has a lattice
norm $\left\Vert .\right\Vert $ and we give a necessary and sufficient

essentially a largest element $\left\Vert .\right\Vert _{1}$ and a smallest

we show that $E\oplus\mathbb{R}$ is a Banach lattice if and only if $E$ is a

Kakutani's Representation Theorem.

rate of best approximation by multivariate polynomials on a connected and
compact $C^2$-domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$. This new modulus of
smoothness is defined via finite differences along the directions of coordinate
axes, and along a number of tangential directions from the boundary. With this
modulus, we prove both the direct Jackson inequality and the corresponding
inverse for best polynomial approximation in $L_p(\Omega)$. The Jackson
inequality is established for the full range of $0<p\leq \infty$, while its
proof relies on (i) Whitney type estimates with constants depending only on
certain parameters; and (ii) highly localized polynomial partitions of unity on
a $C^2$-domain. Both (i) and (ii) are of independent interest. In particular,
our Whitney type estimate (i) is established for directional moduli of
smoothness rather than the ordinary moduli of smoothness, and is applicable to
functions on a very wide class of domains (not necessarily convex). It
generalizes an earlier result of Dekel and Leviatan on Whitney type estimates
on convex domains. The inverse inequality is established for $1\leq p\leq
\infty$, and its proof relies on a new Bernstein type inequality associated
with the tangential derivatives on the boundary of $\Omega$. Such an inequality

public health. Their main challenge is model parameterization given
surveillance data, a problem which often limits their practical usage.
  We offer a solution to this problem by developing a Bayesian methodology
suitable to epidemiological models driven by network data. The greatest
difficulty in obtaining a concentrated parameter posterior is the quality of
surveillance data; disease measurements are often scarce and carry little
information about the parameters. The often overlooked problem of the model's
identifiability therefore needs to be addressed, and we do so using a hierarchy
of increasingly realistic known truth experiments.
  Our proposed Bayesian approach performs convincingly across all our synthetic
tests. From pathogen measurements of shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli

first-principles confronted with data. Within this model we explore the
potential of a Bayesian public health framework by assessing the efficiency of
disease detection and -intervention scenarios.

$l_1+l_2\le 2k-1$ ($l_2$ is set to $1$ when there are no $l_2$-way orders). We
also prove that under some combinations, including ranked top-$3$, ranked

two Plackett-Luce models are identifiable. Guided by our theoretical results,
we propose efficient generalized method of moments (GMM) algorithms to learn

metallicities to increase at lower redshifts, and reflects weakly-evolving or

12+log(O/H) < 8 but saturates to R3=3 at higher metallicities owing to a
cancellation between enrichment and spectral softening. Nonetheless, campaigns

private information from the players. Hence, the challenge here is twofold: (i)
incentivize players to reveal their private information truthfully, (ii)
incentivize them to collaborate together. We show that existing reward
distribution mechanisms or auctions cannot solve the challenge. Hence, we
propose the very first mechanism for the problem from the perspective of both
mechanism design and coalitional games.

understand the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in
ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, since heavy quarks are produced in the
initial stages of the collisions and subsequently interact with the medium
throughout its evolution. In the QGP, strange quarks are expected to be
abundantly produced and may recombine with charm quarks leading to an
enhancement of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$) of ${\rm D}_{\rm
s}^{+}$ mesons compared to that of other charmed meson states at low and
intermediate $p_{\rm T}$. The measurement of elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of ${\rm
D}_{\rm s}^{+}$ mesons is useful to determine the degree of thermalisation of
charm quarks in the collective expansion of the QGP. In addition, charm quarks
could recombine with light di-quark states in the medium, which would lead to
an enhancement of the $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}/{\rm D}^{0}$ baryon-to-meson ratio
as compared to that in pp collisions. Precise measurements of these particle
species in Pb-Pb collisions, therefore, give a deeper insight into the
hadronisation mechanisms that heavy quarks undergo in the strongly-interacting
medium. In this contribution, the latest results measured with ALICE for ${\rm

much of the variability observed in a trait is attributable to genetic
differences. Existing methods for estimating heritability are most often based
on random-effect models, typically for computational reasons. The alternative
of using a fixed-effect model has received much more limited attention in the
literature. Results: In this paper, we propose a generic strategy for
heritability inference, termed as ``boosting heritability"", by combining the
advantageous features of different recent methods to produce an estimate of the
heritability with a high-dimensional linear model. Boosting heritability uses
in particular a multiple sample splitting strategy which leads in general to a
stable and and accurate estimate. We use both simulated data and real
antibiotic resistance data from a major human pathogen, Sptreptococcus
pneumoniae, to demonstrate the attractive features of our inference strategy.
Conclusions: Boosting is shown to offer a reliable and practically useful tool
for inference about heritability.

(fcc)materials can effectively improve the combination of strength and

and gliding of twinning partial dislocations on consecutive close-packed atomic
planes. Here we unveil a completely different twinning mechanism being active
in metastable fcc materials. The transformation-mediated twinning (TMT) is
featured by a preceding displacive transformation from the fcc phase to the
hexagonal close-packed (hcp) one, followed by a second-step transformation from
the hcp phase to the fcc twin. The nucleation of the intermediate hcp phase is
driven by the thermodynamic instability and the negative stacking fault energy
of the metastable fcc phase. The intermediate hcp structure is characterized by
the easy slips of Shockley partial dislocations on the basal planes, which
leads to both fcc and fcc twin platelets during deformation, creating more twin
boundaries and further enhancing the prosperity of twins. The disclosed
fundamental understanding of the complex dislocation mechanism of deformation
twinning in metastable alloys paves the road to design novel materials with
outstanding mechanical properties.

also the particular case when $H$ is a star graph. Recently this case received
the attention of researchers from the algorithm community because of its
applications in interface modelling of wireless networks. To the algorithm
community, the problem is known as maximum edge $q$-colouring problem.
  In this paper, we study the maximum edge $2$-colouring problem from the
approximation algorithm point of view. The case $q=2$ is particularly
interesting due to its application in real-life problems. Algorithmically, this
problem is known to be NP-hard for $q\ge 2$. For the case of $q=2$, it is also
known that no polynomial-time algorithm can approximate to a factor less than
$3/2$ assuming the unique games conjecture. Feng et al. showed a
$2$-approximation algorithm for this problem. Later Adamaszek and Popa
presented a $5/3$-approximation algorithm with the additional assumption that
the input graph has a perfect matching. Note that the obvious but the only
known algorithm issues different colours to the edges of a maximum matching
(say $M$) and different colours to the connected components of $G \setminus M$.
In this article, we give a new analysis of the aforementioned algorithm leading
to an improved approximation bound for triangle-free graphs with perfect
matching. We also show a new lower bound when the input graph is triangle-free.
The contribution of the paper is a completely new, deeper and closer analysis
of how the optimum achieves a higher number of colours than the matching based
algorithm, mentioned above.

is properly removed by the unitary correlation operator method (UCOM).
Meanwhile, the tensor correlation is neglected due to the very rich neutron
environment in neutron star, where the total isospin of two nucleons can be
approximately regarded as $T=1$. The equations of state of neutron star matter
are calculated in $\beta$ equilibrium and charge neutrality conditions. The
properties of neutron star, such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability are
obtained by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and tidal equation.
The maximum masses of neutron from Bonn A, B, C potentials are around
$2.2M_\odot$. The radius are $12.40-12.91$ km at $1.4M_\odot$, respectively.
The corresponding tidal deformabilities are $\Lambda_{1.4}=293-355$. All of

also point out an interesting critical phenomenon, a sudden change of the order
of magnitude of the discrepancy of $\{n_k \alpha\}$ as the Diophantine type of

from finding the best trade-off between conflicting mechanical properties (e.g.
yield stress and yield strain), the optimization enables us to find the

equations are derived by insights from the findings of multi-objective

highly resilient because of two distinct deformation mechanisms depending on
the dimensions of CCNTs. For small CCNTs, extraordinary extensibility is mainly
contributed by buckling and nanohinge-like deformation with maintaining the
inner coil diameter, whereas for large CCNTs this is accomplished by the
creation of a straight CNT-like structure in the inner-edge of the CCNT with a
helical graphene ribbon twisted around it. These findings would shed light on

should be trusted. We designed DR$\vert$GRADUATE taking into account the

built upon a Multiple Instance Learning framework allow DR$\vert$GRADUATE to
infer an image grade associated with an explanation map and a prediction
uncertainty while being trained only with image-wise labels. DR$\vert$GRADUATE
was trained on the Kaggle training set and evaluated across multiple datasets.
In DR grading, a quadratic-weighted Cohen's kappa (QWK) between 0.71 and 0.84
was achieved in five different datasets. We show that high QWK values occur for
images with low prediction uncertainty, thus indicating that this uncertainty
is a valid measure of the predictions' quality. Further, bad quality images are
generally associated with higher uncertainties, showing that images not
suitable for diagnosis indeed lead to less trustworthy predictions.
Additionally, tests on unfamiliar medical image data types suggest that
DR$\vert$GRADUATE allows outlier detection. The attention maps generally
highlight regions of interest for diagnosis. These results show the great

explain the rotation profile of low-mass stars has been emphasized by
asteroseimology and waves are among the potential candidates to do so. In this
article, our objective is not to review all the literature related to the
transport of angular momentum by waves but rather to emphasize the way it is to
be computed in stellar models. We stress that to model wave transport of
angular momentum is a non-trivial issue that requires to properly account for
interactions between meridional circulation and waves. Also, while many authors
only considered the effect of the wave momentum flux in the mean momentum
equation, we show that this is an incomplete picture that prevents from
grasping the main physics of the problem. We thus present the Transform
Eulerian Formalism (TEM) which enable to properly address the problem.

$\Gamma$ is a point of an edge where a horizontal and a vertical segment meet.
$\Gamma$ is bend-minimum if it has the minimum number of bends over all
possible planar orthogonal drawings of $G$. This paper addresses a long
standing, widely studied, open question: Given a planar 3-graph $G$ (i.e., a
planar graph with vertex degree at most three), what is the best computational
upper bound to compute a bend-minimum planar orthogonal drawing of $G$ in the
variable embedding setting? In this setting the algorithm can choose among the
exponentially many planar embeddings of $G$ the one that leads to an orthogonal
drawing with the minimum number of bends. We answer the question by describing
an $O(n)$-time algorithm that computes a bend-minimum planar orthogonal drawing
of $G$ with at most one bend per edge, where $n$ is the number of vertices of
$G$. The existence of an orthogonal drawing algorithm that simultaneously
minimizes the total number of bends and the number of bends per edge was

tau lepton universality in $W$ boson decays at the LHC. We compare directly the
ratio of the numbers of selected $\ell-\tau$ and $e-\mu$ final states in
di-leptonic $tt$ events with that in $Z/\gamma^*\rightarrow\tau^+\tau^-$
events. Here $\ell=e$ or $\mu$ and $\tau$ is a candidate semi-hadronic tau
decay. This ""double-ratio"" cancels to first order sensitivity to systematic
uncertainties on the reconstruction of $e$, $\mu$, and $\tau$ leptons, thus
improving very significantly the precision to which tau lepton universality can
be tested in $W$ boson decay branching ratios at the LHC. Using particle-level
Monte Carlo events, and a parameterised simulation of detector performance, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and estimate the most significant
residual sources of uncertainty arising from experimental and phenomenological
systematics. Our studies indicate that a single experiment precision on the tau
lepton universality test of around 1.4% is achievable with a data set of 140
fb$^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. This would improve significantly upon the
precision of 2.5% on the four-experiment combined LEP2 measurements. If the
central value of the proposed new measurement were equal to the central value

regularity terms. The lower regularity terms are here explicitly known and
capture the solution singularities. The higher regularity terms, meanwhile, are
defined as the solution of its own mixed Poisson equation. With the solution
splitting in hand, we then define a singularity removal based mixed finite
element method in which only the higher regularity are approximated

rate when compared to approximating the full solution. In particular, we show
that the singularity removal based method yields optimal convergence rates for

face reconstruction from a single image. Our approach uses a 3DMM-based coarse
model and a displacement map in UV-space to represent a 3D face. Unlike
previous work addressing the problem, our learning framework does not require
supervision of surrogate ground-truth 3D models computed with traditional
approaches. Instead, we utilize the input image itself as supervision during
learning. In the first stage, we combine a photometric loss and a facial
perceptual loss between the input face and the rendered face, to regress a
3DMM-based coarse model. In the second stage, both the input image and the
regressed texture of the coarse model are unwrapped into UV-space, and then
sent through an image-toimage translation network to predict a displacement map
in UVspace. The displacement map and the coarse model are used to render a
final detailed face, which again can be compared with the original input image
to serve as a photometric loss for the second stage. The advantage of learning
displacement map in UV-space is that face alignment can be explicitly done
during the unwrapping, thus facial details are easier to learn from large
amount of data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method over previous work.

current study, we demonstrate a novel method for analyzing brown dwarf spectra,
which combines the use of the Sonora, AMES-Cond and HELIOS model grids with the
supervised machine learning method of the random forest. Besides performing
atmospheric retrieval, the random forest enables information content analysis
of the three model grids as a natural outcome of the method, both individually
on each grid and by comparing the grids against one another, via computing
large suites of mock retrievals. Our analysis reveals that the different
choices made in modelling the alkali line shapes hinder the use of the alkali
lines as gravity indicators. Nevertheless, the spectrum longward of 1.2 micron
encodes enough information on the surface gravity to allow its inference from
retrieval. Temperature may be accurately and precisely inferred independent of
the choice of model grid, but not the surface gravity. We apply random forest
retrieval to three objects: the benchmark T7.5 brown dwarf GJ 570D; and Epsilon
Indi Ba (T1.5 brown dwarf) and Bb (T6 brown dwarf), which are part of a binary

explore the search space and produce better examples for training the next TNN.

applying forward limit positivity bounds on the scattering amplitudes to
exclude the region of parameter space devoid of a standard UV completion. We
focus on two classes of theories that have the highest possible EFT cutoff,
namely those theories modelled on ghost-free interacting theories of a single
massive spin-2 field. We find that the very existence of interactions between
the spin-2 fields implies more stringent bounds on all the parameters of the
EFT, even on the spin-2 self-interactions. This arises for two reasons. First,
with every new field included in the low-energy EFT, comes the `knowledge' of
an extra pole to be subtracted, hence strengthening the positivity bounds.
Second, while adding new fields increases the number of free parameters from
the new interactions, this is rapidly overcome by the increased number of
positivity bounds for different possible scattering processes. We also discuss
how positivity bounds appear to favour relations between operators that
effectively raise the cutoff of the EFT.

Using the Lyapunov exponents of a flow at different Reynolds numbers, the
scaling of the dimension of the chaotic attractor for a three-dimensional

coincides with regions of large velocity gradients at lower Reynolds numbers
and enstrophy at higher Reynolds numbers, but does not coincide with regions of
large kinetic energy. Further, the response of the flow to perturbations is
more and more localized as the Reynolds number increases. Finally, the energy

electron spin noise spectra exhibit a two-peak structure - a zero-frequency
line and a satellite - that we attribute to the electron spin precession in a
frozen random nuclear spin distribution. This implies a surprisingly long
electron spin correlation time whatever the doping level, even above the Mott
transition. Using spatiotemporal spin noise spectroscopy, we demonstrate that
the observation of a satellite in the spin noise spectra and a fast spin
diffusion are mutually exclusive. This is consistent with a shortening of the
electron spin correlation time due to hopping between donors. We interpret our
data via a model assuming that the low temperature spin relaxation is due to
hopping between donors in presence of hyperfine and anisotropic exchange
interactions. Most of our results can be interpreted in this framework. First,
a transition from inhomogeneous to homogeneous broadening of the spin noise
peaks and the disappearance of the satellite are observed when the hopping rate
becomes larger than the Larmor period induced by the local nuclear fields. In
the regime of homogeneous broadening the ratio between the spin diffusion
constant and the spin relaxation rate has a value in good agreement with the
Dresselhaus constant. In the regime of inhomogeneous broadening, most of the
samples exhibit a broadening consistent with the distribution of local nuclear
fields. We obtain a new estimate of the hyperfine constants in CdTe and a value
of 0.10 Tesla for the maximum nuclear field. Finally, our study also reveals a
puzzle as our samples behave as if the active donor concentration was reduced

small, $|\Sigma_n(S)|\leq |S|-n+1$, it is known that the terms of $S$ can be
partitioned into $n$ nonempty sets $A_1,\ldots,A_n\subseteq G$ such that
$\Sigma_n(S)=A_1+\ldots+A_n$. Moreover, if the upper bound is strict, then

$H=\{g\in G:\; g+\Sigma_n(S)=\Sigma_n(S)\}$ is the stabilizer of $\Sigma_n(S)$.
This allows structural results for sumsets to be used to study the subsum set

analog of Kneser's Theorem for sumsets. In this paper, we show that such a

more efficient for pair production. This is in contrast to what is commonly

performance as an alternative to recurrent neural networks in end-to-end (E2E)

in that the entire input sequence is required to compute self-attention. We
have proposed a block processing method for the Transformer encoder by
introducing a context-aware inheritance mechanism. An additional context
embedding vector handed over from the previously processed block helps to
encode not only local acoustic information but also global linguistic, channel,
and speaker attributes. In this paper, we extend it towards an entire online
E2E ASR system by introducing an online decoding process inspired by monotonic
chunkwise attention (MoChA) into the Transformer decoder. Our novel MoChA
training and inference algorithms exploit the unique properties of Transformer,
whose attentions are not always monotonic or peaky, and have multiple heads and
residual connections of the decoder layers. Evaluations of the Wall Street
Journal (WSJ) and AISHELL-1 show that our proposed online Transformer decoder
outperforms conventional chunkwise approaches.

testing evolutionary and seismic models. Precise photometry and spectroscopy
obtained during multi-site campaigns on young open clusters allows discovering
rich samples of pulsating stars and using them in a simultaneous seismic
modelling called ensemble asteroseismology. The aim of this study is to obtain
the age of the open cluster NGC 6910 by means of ensemble asteroseismology of
the early-type pulsating members, to derive their stellar parameters, and to
classify the excited modes. We used time-series analysis, performed photometric
and spectroscopic mode identification, and calculated grids of evolutionary and
seismic models to apply the procedure of ensemble asteroseismology for nine
pulsating members of NGC 6910. With two iterations of the procedure of ensemble
asteroseismology applied to nine pulsating stars we derived an age of
10.6$^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$ Myr for NGC 6910. Of the nine pulsating stars examined in
the paper, eight are $\beta$ Cep stars, including three that are hybrid $\beta$
Cep and slowly pulsating B-type (SPB) pulsators, and one is an SPB star.
Interestingly, the least massive $\beta$ Cep star, NGC 6910-38, has a mass of
about 5.6 M$_\odot$. The present theory does not predict unstable $p$ modes in
B-type stars with such a low mass. The $g$ modes with relatively high
frequencies ($>3.5$ d$^{-1}$), observed in three members of the cluster, are
also stable according to seismic modelling. Both findings pose a challenge for
theoretical calculations and prompt a revision of the opacities. The procedure
of ensemble asteroseismology was found to be successful for NGC 6910 and $\chi$
Per on the basis of pulsating B-type stars and can therefore be applied to
other young open clusters that are rich in such stars.

The utility of this lattice model is demonstrated by simulating the admittance

end-of-semester surveys returned by a total of 749 students in 2014-2015, at 10
institutions that employed at least part of the introductory astronomy lecture
and lab curriculum we first implemented at UNC-Chapel Hill in 2009. Surveys
were designed to measure each student's attitude, and to probe the correlation
of attitude with their utilization of, and satisfaction with, various course
components, along with other measures of their academic background and their
self-assessed performance in the course. We find that students' attitudes are
significantly positively correlated with the grade they expect to receive, and
their rating of the course's overall effectiveness. To a lesser degree, we find
that students' attitudes are positively correlated with their mathematical
background, whether they intend to major or pursue a career in STEM, and their
rating of the effectiveness of the instructor. We find that students' attitudes
are negatively correlated with the amount of work they perceived the course to
involve, and, surprisingly, the size and reputation of their home institution.
We also find that, for the subsets of students who were exposed to them,
students' attitudes are positively correlated with their perception of the
helpfulness of the lecture component of the course, and of telescope-based labs
that utilized UNC-CH's Skynet Robotic Telescope Network.

significantly reduced compared with previous art, thus being practical to

proposed to provide a solution to spectrum scarcity, most of them have many
associated tradeoffs. In this context, one of the emerging ideas relates to the
utilization of cognitive radios (CR) for future heterogeneous networks
(HetNets). This paper provides a marriage of two promising candidates (i.e., CR
and HetNets) for beyond fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. More
specifically, a joint power allocation and user assignment solution for the
multi-user underlay CR-based HetNets has been proposed and evaluated. To
counter the limiting factors in these networks, the individual power of
transmitting nodes and interference temperature protection constraints of the
primary networks have been considered. An efficient solution is designed from
the dual decomposition approach, where the optimal user assignment is obtained
for the optimized power allocation at each node. The simulation results
validate the superiority of the proposed optimization scheme against
conventional baseline techniques.

the standard model of particle physics with a $\rm SU(2)$ singlet leptonic
Dirac fermion $\chi$, which represents the candidate of dark matter (DM), and
two triplet scalars $\Delta_{1,2}$ with hierarchical masses. In the early
Universe, the CP violating out-of-equilibrium decay of lightest $\Delta$
generates a net $B-L$ asymmetry in the visible sector (comprising of SM
fields), where $B$ and $L$ represents the total baryon and lepton number
respectively. A part of this asymmetry gets transferred to the dark sector
(comprising of DM $\chi$) through a dimension eight operator which conserves
$B-L$. Above the electroweak phase transition, the $B-L$ asymmetry of the
visible sector gets converted to a net $B$-asymmetry by the $B+L$ violating
sphalerons, while the $B-L$ asymmetry of the dark sector remains untouched
which we see today as relics of DM. We show that the observed DM abundance can
be explained for a DM mass about 8 GeV. We then introduce an additional singlet
scalar field $\phi$ which mixes with the SM-Higgs to annihilate the symmetric
component of the DM resonantly which requires the singlet scalar mass to be
twice the DM mass, {\it i.e.} around 16 GeV, which can be searched at collider
experiments. In our model, the active neutrinos also get small masses by the
induced vacuum expectation value (vev) of the triplet scalars $\Delta_{1,2}$.
In the later part of the paper we discuss all the constraints on model
parameters coming from invisible Higgs decay, Higgs signal strength, DM direct
detection and relic density of DM.

synthesized face can well preserve the background information and personal

challenging in practice. Taking a statistical learning viewpoint, the

nonlinearity of Einstein equations, first of all). Starting from the
cosmological description of the Universe within the framework of the standard

hazy mist we have been calling the Standard Model (SM) of elementary particles.
An attempt is made here to construct a coherent description of the SM today,
because only precisely articulated theories can be targeted for annihilation,
corroboration, and alteration. To this end it is useful to categorize the
facts, mysteries and myths that together build a single conception of the SM.
For example, it is argued that constructing a myth for how neutrinos obtain
mass is useful for progress. We also advocate for interpreting the cosmological
constant, dark matter, baryogenesis, and inflation as four ""mysteries of the
cosmos"" that are indeterminate regarding new particles or interactions, despite
a multitude of available particle explanations. Some history of the
ever-changing SM is also presented to remind us that today's SM is not our
parents' SM, nor will it likely be our children's SM.

on the photo-thermoelectric effect (PTE) that occurs across an entire
homogeneous graphene channel. The proposed photodetector incorporates the
long-range dielectric-loaded surface plasmon polariton (LR-DLSPP) waveguide
with a metal stripe serving simultaneously as a plasmon supporting metallic
material and one of the metal electrodes. Large in-plane component of the
transverse magnetic (TM) plasmonic mode can couple efficiently to the graphene
causing large temperature increases across an entire graphene channel with a
maximum located at the metal stripe edge. As a result, the electronic
temperatures exceeding 12000K at input power of only a few tens of {\mu}W can
be obtained at the telecom wavelength of 1550nm. Even with limitations such as
the melting temperature of graphene (T= 4510 K), a responsivity exceeding at
least 200 A/W is achievable at telecom wavelength of 1550 nm. It is also shown
that under certain operation conditions, the PTE channel photocurrent can be
isolated from photovoltaic and p-n junction PTE contributions providing an
efficient way for optimizing the overall photodetector performance.

possible classification of all compact affine quaternionic curves and surfaces.
It is established that on an affine quaternionic manifold there is one and only
one affine quaternionic structure. A direct result, based on the celebrated
Kodaira Theorem that studies compact complex manifolds in complex dimension 2,
states that the only compact affine quaternionic curves are the quaternionic
tori and the primary Hopf surface S^3 x S^1. As for compact affine quaternionic
surfaces, we restrict to the complete ones: the study of their fundamental
groups, together with the inspection of all nilpotent hypercomplex simply
connected 8-dimensional Lie Groups, identifies a path towards their
classification.

transport systems (ITS) with cellular-vehicle to everything (C-V2X) and IEEE
802.11p being the two competing enabling technologies. This paper presents
multi-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) based models to study the
medium access control (MAC) layer performance of the IEEE 802.11p standard and
C-V2X Mode 4. These models are coupled with an appropriate DTMC based queuing
model, and traffic generators for periodic cooperative awareness messages
(CAMs) and event-driven decentralized environmental notification messages
(DENMs). Closed-form solutions for the steady-state probabilities of the models
are obtained, which are then utilized to derive expressions for several key
performance metrics. An application for a highway scenario is presented to
provide numerical results and to draw insights on the performance. In
particular, a performance comparison between IEEE 802.11p and C-V2X Mode 4 in
terms of the average delay, the collision probability, and the channel
utilization is presented. The results show that IEEE 802.11p is superior in
terms of average delay, whereas C-V2X Mode 4 excels in collision resolution.
The paper also includes design insights on possible future MAC layer
performance enhancements of both standards.

As cars
gradually become part of the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, several
stakeholders discover the value of in-vehicle network logs containing the
measurements of the multitude of sensors deployed within the car. This wealth
of data is also expected to be exploitable by third parties for the purpose of
profiling drivers in order to provide personalized, valueadded services.
Although several prior works have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of
driver re-identification using the in-vehicle network data captured on the
vehicle's CAN (Controller Area Network) bus, they inferred the identity of the
driver only from known sensor signals (such as the vehicle's speed, brake pedal
position, steering wheel angle, etc.) extracted from the CAN messages. However,
car manufacturers intentionally do not reveal exact signal location and
semantics within CAN logs. We show that the inference of driver identity is
possible even with off-the-shelf machine learning techniques without
reverse-engineering the CAN protocol. We demonstrate our approach on a dataset
of 33 drivers and show that a driver can be re-identified and distinguished
from other drivers with an accuracy of 75-85%.

  Controlled Ultrasound Frequency for Biomedical Applications","19 pages, 8 figures",,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Focused ultrasound has attracted great attention in minimally invasive
therapy, gene delivery, brain stimulation, etc. Frequency below 1 MHz has been
identified preferable for high-efficacy drug delivery, gene transfection and
neurostimulation due to minimized tissue heating and cell fragmentation.
However, the poor spatial resolution of several millimeters and the large
device diameter of ~25 mm of current sub-MHz ultrasound technology severely
hinders its further applications for effective, precise, safe and wearable
biomedical studies and clinical use. To address this issue, we report the
development of a novel fiber-based optoacoustic emitter (FOE). The FOE, a new
miniaturized ultrasound source, is composed of an optical diffusion coating
layer and an expansion coating layer at an optical fiber distal end with a
diameter of approximately 500 microns. Taking advantage of the fiber size and
diffusive nanoparticles introduced, the ultrasound generated by the FOEs showed
a spatial confinement of sub-millimeter. The optoacoustic conversion efficiency
was maximized through choosing absorbing nanomaterials and thermal expansion
matrix. Controllable frequencies in the range of 0.083 MHz to 5.500 MHz were
achieved through using the diffusion layer as a damping material or modifying
the nano-composition in the expansion layer. This sub-MHz frequency
controllability allows FOEs to be used as a localized ultrasound source for
precise cell modulation. We demonstrated optoacoustic cell membrane
sonoporation with a localization of sub-millimeter and negligible heat
deposition, implicating its broad biomedical applications, including
region-specific drug delivery, gene transfection as well as localized neuron
stimulation.
