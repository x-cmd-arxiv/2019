equilibrium simulations of binary and ternary mixtures of nitrogen, methane and
ethane for a range of temperatures between 90K and 110K at a pressure of 1.5
atm, thermodynamic conditions that may exist on the Saturn's giant moon, Titan.
We find that --(i) the solubility of nitrogen in both methane and ethane
decreases with increasing temperature; (ii) the solubility of nitrogen in
methane is much larger compared to that in ethane at low temperatures, (iii)
solubility of nitrogen in a ternary mixture of methane, ethane, and nitrogen
increases upon increasing mole-fraction of methane. Our results are in
quantitative agreement with the recent experimental measurement of the
solubility of nitrogen in methane, ethane, and a mixture of methane and ethane.
Furthermore, we find a strong temperature-dependent surface adsorption of
nitrogen at the nitrogen-hydrocarbon interface, previously unknown. We have
also investigated surface tension of the gas-liquid interface and find that it
decreases upon decreasing temperature. Moreover, we find that the interfacial
layer of adsorbed nitrogen and ethane show a preferential orientational
ordering at the interface.

based on the voice presented to a system. Different synthetic approaches allow
spoofing to deceive ASV systems (ASVs), whether using techniques to imitate a
voice or recunstruct the features. Attackers try to beat up the ASVs using four
general techniques; impersonation, speech synthesis, voice conversion, and
replay. The last technique is considered as a common and high potential tool
for spoofing purposes since replay attacks are more accessible and require no
technical knowledge from adversaries. In this study, we introduce a novel
replay spoofing countermeasure for ASVs. Accordingly, we used the Constant Q
Cepstral Coefficient (CQCC) features fed into an autoencoder to attain more
informative features and to consider the noise information of spoofed

by dropping unnecessary computations from three complementary levels:
stochastic mini-batch dropping on the data level; selective layer update on the
model level; and sign prediction for low-cost, low-precision back-propagation,
on the algorithm level. Extensive simulations and ablation studies, with real
energy measurements from an FPGA board, confirm the superiority of our proposed

when training ResNet-74 on CIFAR-10, we achieve aggressive energy savings of

  The first one is how many masses we can simultaneously partition with a

young globular clusters and in the centres of galaxies. A binary form of
Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion results whereby the accretion rate depends on
the binary properties: the stellar masses and separation, and the relative wind
speed. We present the results of simulations performed with the hydrodynamic
code GANDALF, to determine the mass accretion rates over a range of binary
separations, inclinations and mass ratios. When the binary separation is short,
the binary system accretes like a single star, while accretion onto stars in
wide binaries is barely affected by their companion. We investigate
intermediate-separation systems in some detail, finding that as the binary
separation is increased, accretion rates smoothly decrease from the rate equal
to that of a single star to the rate expected from two isolated stars. The form
of this decrease depends on the relative centre-of-mass velocity of the binary
and the gas, with faster-moving binaries showing a shallower decrease.
Accretion rates vary little with orbital inclination, except when the orbit is
side-on and the stars pass through each others' wakes. The specific angular
momentum accretion rate also depends on the inclination but is never sufficient
to prevent the binary orbit from contracting. Our results may be applied to
accretion onto protostars, pollution of stars in globular and nuclear clusters,

devices, ranging from double emulsion generation to localized cell adhesion. A
number of techniques, often based on masking, have been developed to produce
spatially-resolved wettability patterns at the surface of

natural hydrophobic recovery of PDMS: hydrophilized PDMS surfaces tend to
return to hydrophobicity with time, mainly because of diffusion of low
molecular weight silicone species to the surface. Instead of trying to avoid
this phenomenon, we propose in this work to take advantage of hydrophobic
recovery to modulate spatially the surface wettability of PDMS. Because
temperature speeds up the rate of hydrophobic recovery, we show that
space-resolved hydrophobic patterns can be produced by locally heating a
plasma-hydrophilized PDMS surface with microresistors. Importantly, local
wettability is quantified in microchannels using a fluorescent probe. This
""thermo-patterning"" technique provides a simple route to in situ wettability
patterning in closed PDMS chips, without requiring further surface chemistry.

to protect the organism from a great variety of pathogens. Since the initial
repertoire is the result of random gene rearrangement, binding of receptors is
not limited to pathogen-associated antigens but also includes self antigens.
There is a fine balance between having a diverse repertoire, protecting from
many different pathogens, and yet reducing its self-reactivity as far as
possible to avoid damage to self. In the ageing immune system this balance is
altered, manifesting in reduced specificity of response to pathogens or
vaccination on a background of higher self-reactivity. To answer the question
whether age-related changes of repertoire in the diversity and self/non-self
affinity balance of antibodies could explain the reduced efficacy of the
humoral response in older people, we construct a minimal mathematical model of
the humoral immune response. The principle of least damage allows us, for a
given repertoire of antibodies, to resolve a tension between the necessity to
neutralise target antigens as quickly as possible and the requirement to limit
the damage to self antigens leading to an optimal dynamics of immune response.
The model predicts slowing down of immune response for repertoires with reduced
diversity and increased self-reactivity.

spherical particles upon the characteristics of their spatial distribution
through a random Poisson process (RPP). This information is of special interest
when using RPP data as a reference for the analysis of the spatial structure of
a given (non-RPP) particulate system, in which case ignoring finite-size
effects upon the former may yield misleading conclusions. We perform Monte
Carlo simulations in triply-periodic spatial domains, and then analyze the
particle-centered Voronoi tesselations for solid volume fractions ranging from
10^(-5) to 0.3. We show that the standard-deviation of these volumes decreases
with the solid volume fraction, the deviation from the value of point sets
being reasonably approximated by an exponential function. As can be expected,
the domain size for which the random assemblies of finite-size particles are
generated has a constraining effect if the number of particles per realization
is chosen too small. This effect is quantified, and recommendations are given.
We have also revisited the case of random point sets (i.e. the limit of
vanishing particle diameter), for which we have confirmed the accuracy of the
earlier data by Tanemura [Forma, 18(4):221-247, 2003].

formalism of bilinear algorithms to describe and analyze all of the most
popular approaches. This unified lens permits us to study the relationship
between different variants of convolution as well as to derive error bounds and
analyze the cost of the various algorithms. We provide new derivations, which
predominantly leverage matrix and tensor algebra, to describe the Winograd
family of convolution algorithms as well as reductions between 1D and
multidimensional convolution. We provide cost and error bounds as well as
experimental numerical studies. Our experiments for two of these algorithms,
the overlap-add approach and Winograd convolution algorithm with polynomials of
degree greater than one, show that fast convolution algorithms can rival the
accuracy of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) without using complex arithmetic.
These algorithms can be used for convolution problems with multidimensional

human behavior during planning to reason about their future motion. Since
accurately modeling human behavior a priori is challenging, such models are
often parameterized, enabling the robot to adapt predictions based on
observations by maintaining a distribution over the model parameters. Although
this enables data and priors to improve the human model, observation models are
difficult to specify and priors may be incorrect, leading to erroneous state
predictions that can degrade the safety of the robot motion plan. In this work,
we seek to design a predictor which is more robust to misspecified models and
priors, but can still leverage human behavioral data online to reduce
conservatism in a safe way. To do this, we cast human motion prediction as a
Hamilton-Jacobi reachability problem in the joint state space of the human and
the belief over the model parameters. We construct a new continuous-time
dynamical system, where the inputs are the observations of human behavior, and
the dynamics include how the belief over the model parameters change. The
results of this reachability computation enable us to both analyze the effect
of incorrect priors on future predictions in continuous state and time, as well
as to make predictions of the human state in the future. We compare our
approach to the worst-case forward reachable set and a stochastic predictor
which uses Bayesian inference and produces full future state distributions. Our
comparisons in simulation and in hardware demonstrate how our framework can
enable robust planning while not being overly conservative, even when the human
model is inaccurate.

running gait analysis, allowing the derivation of parameters such as stance
time. Heuristic-based methods exist to estimate these key gait events from
tibial accelerometry. However, these methods are tailored to very specific
acceleration profiles, which may offer complications when dealing with larger
data sets and inherent biological variability. Therefore, this paper
investigates whether a structured machine learning approach can achieve a more
accurate prediction of running gait event timings from tibial accelerometry.
Force-based event detection acted as the criterion measure in order to assess
the accuracy, repeatability and sensitivity of the predicted gait events. A
heuristic method and two structured machine learning methods were employed to
derive initial contact, toe off and stance time from tibial acceleration
signals. Both a structured perceptron model (median absolute error of stance
time estimation: 10.00 $\pm$ 8.73 ms) and a structured recurrent neural network
model (median absolute error of stance time estimation: 6.50 $\pm$ 5.74 ms)
significantly outperformed the existing heuristic approach (median absolute
error of stance time estimation: 11.25 $\pm$ 9.52 ms) on data from 93 rearfoot
runners. Thus, results indicate that a structured recurrent neural network
machine learning model offers the most accurate and consistent estimation of
the gait events and its derived stance time during level overground running.
The machine learning methods seem less affected by intra- and inter-subject
variation within the data, allowing for accurate and efficient automated data
output during rearfoot overground running. Furthermore offering possibilities
for real-time monitoring and biofeedback during prolonged measurements, even

  We first examine the problem from the perspective of \emph{self-consistent

allgather, and alltoall operations using only similar operations of the given

These implementations which rely on a decomposition of the communication domain

to expectation, in many cases show surprising performance improvements with
different MPI libraries on a small 36-node dual-socket, dual-lane Intel
OmniPath cluster, indicating severe problems with the native MPI library

more than a factor of two faster than the corresponding MPI collectives. We see

exhibit a magnetic spin Hall effect (MSHE), as was recently discovered [Kimata
\textit{et al.}, Nature \textbf{565}, 627-630 (2019)]. To date, the MSHE is
still awaiting its intuitive explanation. Here we relate the MSHE to the
vorticity of spin currents in the Fermi sea, which explains pictorially the
origin of the MSHE. For all magnetic Laue groups that allow for nonzero spin
current vorticities the related tensor elements of the MSH conductivity are
given. Minimal requirements for the occurrence of a MSHE are compatibility with
either a magnetization or a magnetic toroidal quadrupole. This finding implies
in particular that the MSHE is expected in all ferromagnets with sufficiently
large SOC. To substantiate our symmetry analysis, we present various models, in
particular a two-dimensional magnetized Rashba electron gas, that corroborate
an interpretation by means of spin current vortices. Considering thermally
induced spin transport and the magnetic spin Nernst effect in magnetic

By considering spherically symmetric test models, we discuss potential error
sources, and indicate advantages and disadvantages by comparing different
solution methods. Further, we analyse the UV resonance line formation in the
winds of rapidly rotating O stars. Methods: We consider both a (simplified)
continuum model including scattering and thermal sources, and a UV resonance
line transition approximated by a two-level-atom. We applied the
short-characteristics (SC) method, using linear or monotonic B\'ezier
interpolations, to solve the equation of radiative transfer on a non-uniform
Cartesian grid. To calculate scattering dominated problems, our solution method
is supplemented by an accelerated $\Lambda$-iteration scheme. Results: For the
spherical test models, the mean relative error of the source function is on the
$5-20\,\%$ level, depending on the applied interpolation technique and the
complexity of the considered model. All calculated line profiles are in
excellent agreement with corresponding 1D solutions. The predicted line
profiles from fast rotating stars show a distinct behaviour as a function of
rotational speed and inclination. This behaviour is tightly coupled to the wind
structure and the description of gravity darkening and stellar surface
distortion. Conclusions: Our SC methods are ready to be used for quantitative
analyses of UV resonance line profiles. When calculating optically thick

include new physics. Although, some suggestions include simply accounting for
aspects of our Universe that are ignored in the standard model. One example
acknowledges the fact that our Universe contains significant density contrasts
on small scales; in the form of galaxies, galaxy clusters, filaments, and
voids. This small-scale structure is smoothed out in the standard model, by
assuming large-scale homogeneity of the matter distribution, which could have a
measurable effect due to the nonlinearity of Einstein's equations. This
backreaction of small-scale structures on the large-scale dynamics has been
suggested to explain the measured accelerating expansion rate of the Universe.
Current standard cosmological simulations ignore the effects of General
Relativity by assuming purely Newtonian dynamics. In this thesis, we take the
first steps towards quantifying the backreaction of small-scale structures by
performing cosmological simulations that solve Einstein's equations directly.
Simulations like these will allow us to quantify potentially important effects

theories of social influence and identity expression do not explain what
perpetuates these complex, often unpredictable social dynamics. We propose a
theory of social identity expression based on the opposing, but not mutually
exclusive, motives to conform and to be unique among one's neighbors in a
social network. We then model the social dynamics that arise from these
motives. We find that the dynamics typically enter random walks or stochastic
limit cycles rather than converging to a static equilibrium. We also prove that
without social network structure or, alternatively, without the uniqueness
motive, reasonable adaptive dynamics would necessarily converge to equilibrium.
Thus, we show that nuanced psychological assumptions (recognizing preferences
for uniqueness along with conformity) and realistic social network structure
are both necessary for explaining how complex, unpredictable cultural trends
emerge.

potential of our Galaxy, they can cluster locally. Neutrinos should be more
abundant at the Earth position than at an average point in the Universe. This
fact may enhance the expected event rate in any future experiment. Past
calculations of the local neutrino clustering factor only considered a
spherical distribution of matter in the Milky Way and neglected the influence
of other nearby objects like the Virgo cluster, although recent $N$-body
simulations suggest that the latter may actually be important. In this paper,
we adopt a back-tracking technique, well established in the calculation of
cosmic rays fluxes, to perform the first three-dimensional calculation of the
number density of relic neutrinos at the Solar System, taking into account not
only the matter composition of the Milky Way, but also the contribution of the
Andromeda galaxy and the Virgo cluster. The effect of Virgo is indeed found to
be relevant and to depend non-trivially on the value of the neutrino mass. Our

significance of the symmetric off-diagonal exchange interaction (referred to as

We show that the Kitaev interaction ($K$) is ferromagnetic, and that the

completing tasks using the least amount of time/energy, learning multiple
tasks, or dealing with multiple opponents. In the context of reinforcement
learning~(RL), these problems are addressed by (i)~designing a reward function
that simultaneously describes all requirements or (ii)~combining modular value
functions that encode them individually. Though effective, these methods have
critical downsides. Designing good reward functions that balance different
objectives is challenging, especially as the number of objectives grows.
Moreover, implicit interference between goals may lead to performance plateaus
as they compete for resources, particularly when training on-policy. Similarly,
selecting parameters to combine value functions is at least as hard as
designing an all-encompassing reward, given that the effect of their values on
the overall policy is not straightforward. The later is generally addressed by
formulating the conflicting requirements as a constrained RL problem and solved
using Primal-Dual methods. These algorithms are in general not guaranteed to
converge to the optimal solution since the problem is not convex. This work
provides theoretical support to these approaches by establishing that despite
its non-convexity, this problem has zero duality gap, i.e., it can be solved
exactly in the dual domain, where it becomes convex. Finally, we show this
result basically holds if the policy is described by a good
parametrization~(e.g., neural networks) and we connect this result with
primal-dual algorithms present in the literature and we establish the
convergence to the optimal solution.

particles are moving through momentum space, and momentum is singled out as the
primary ontological variable. In this paper we experimentally show how the two
theories lead to different ontological descriptions. We construct the putative
particle trajectories for a two-slit experiment in both the position and
momentum space theories by simulating particle dynamics with coherent light.
Using a method for constructing trajectories through the primary and derived
(i.e. non-primary) spaces, we compare the ontological pictures offered by the
two theories and show that they do not agree. This contradictory behaviour
brings into question which ontology for Bohmian mechanics is to be preferred.

understanding when specific memory systems help more than others and how well
they generalize. The field also has yet to see a prevalent consistent and
rigorous approach for evaluating agent performance on holdout data. In this
paper, we aim to develop a comprehensive methodology to test different kinds of
memory in an agent and assess how well the agent can apply what it learns in
training to a holdout set that differs from the training set along dimensions
that we suggest are relevant for evaluating memory-specific generalization. To
that end, we first construct a diverse set of memory tasks that allow us to
evaluate test-time generalization across multiple dimensions. Second, we
develop and perform multiple ablations on an agent architecture that combines
multiple memory systems, observe its baseline models, and investigate its
performance against the task suite.

  study in satellite remote sensing","6 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables",,,,"cs.LG eess.IV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Numerical models based on physics represent the state-of-the-art in earth
system modeling and comprise our best tools for generating insights and
predictions. Despite rapid growth in computational power, the perceived need
for higher model resolutions overwhelms the latest-generation computers,
reducing the ability of modelers to generate simulations for understanding
parameter sensitivities and characterizing variability and uncertainty. Thus,
surrogate models are often developed to capture the essential attributes of the
full-blown numerical models. Recent successes of machine learning methods,
especially deep learning, across many disciplines offer the possibility that
complex nonlinear connectionist representations may be able to capture the
underlying complex structures and nonlinear processes in earth systems. A
difficult test for deep learning-based emulation, which refers to function
approximation of numerical models, is to understand whether they can be
comparable to traditional forms of surrogate models in terms of computational
efficiency while simultaneously reproducing model results in a credible manner.
A deep learning emulation that passes this test may be expected to perform even
better than simple models with respect to capturing complex processes and
spatiotemporal dependencies. Here we examine, with a case study in
satellite-based remote sensing, the hypothesis that deep learning approaches
can credibly represent the simulations from a surrogate model with comparable
computational efficiency. Our results are encouraging in that the deep learning
emulation reproduces the results with acceptable accuracy and often even faster
performance. We discuss the broader implications of our results in light of the
pace of improvements in high-performance implementations of deep learning as
well as the growing desire for higher-resolution simulations in the earth
sciences.

  Counterpart to a Neutron Star-Black Hole Merger","Accepted to ApJ with no major changes",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ab6a1b",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  On 2019 August 14, the Advanced LIGO and Virgo interferometers detected the
high-significance gravitational wave (GW) signal S190814bv. The GW data
indicated that the event resulted from a neutron star--black hole (NSBH)
merger, or potentially a low-mass binary black hole merger. Due to the low
false alarm rate and the precise localization (23 deg$^2$ at 90\%), S190814bv
presented the community with the best opportunity yet to directly observe an
optical/near-infrared counterpart to a NSBH merger. To search for potential
counterparts, the GROWTH collaboration performed real-time image subtraction on
6 nights of public Dark Energy Camera (DECam) images acquired in the three
weeks following the merger, covering $>$98\% of the localization probability.
Using a worldwide network of follow-up facilities, we systematically undertook
spectroscopy and imaging of optical counterpart candidates. Combining these
data with a photometric redshift catalog, we ruled out each candidate as the
counterpart to S190814bv and we placed deep, uniform limits on the optical
emission associated with S190814bv. For the nearest consistent GW distance,
radiative transfer simulations of NSBH mergers constrain the ejecta mass of
S190814bv to be $M_\mathrm{ej} < 0.04$~$M_{\odot}$ at polar viewing angles, or
$M_\mathrm{ej} < 0.03$~$M_{\odot}$ if the opacity is $\kappa <
2$~cm$^2$g$^{-1}$. Assuming a tidal deformability for the neutron star at the
high end of the range compatible with GW170817 results, our limits would
constrain the BH spin component aligned with the orbital momentum to be $ \chi
< 0.7$ for mass ratios $Q < 6$, with weaker constraints for more compact
neutron stars. We publicly release the photometry from this campaign at

functions of N=2 gauge theory on a compact four-manifold. We consider the
u-plane integral for correlators of point and surface observables of
topologically twisted theories with gauge group SU(2), for an arbitrary
four-manifold with (b1,b2+)=(0,1). The u-plane contribution equals the full
correlator in the absence of Seiberg-Witten contributions at strong coupling,
and coincides with the mathematically defined Donaldson invariants in such
cases. We demonstrate that the u-plane correlators are efficiently determined
using mock modular forms for point observables, and Appell-Lerch sums for
surface observables. We use these results to discuss the asymptotic behavior of
correlators as function of the number of observables. Our findings suggest that
the vev of exponentiated point and surface observables is an entire function of
the fugacities.

whether amorphous topological materials, which lie beyond this classification
due to the lack of long-range structural order, exist in the solid state. We
study amorphous Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin films, which show a metallic behavior and an
increased bulk resistance. The observed low field magnetoresistance due to weak
antilocalization demonstrates a significant number of two dimensional surface
conduction channels. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data is
consistent with a dispersive two-dimensional surface state that crosses the
bulk gap. Spin resolved photoemission spectroscopy shows this state has an
anti-symmetric spin texture resembling that of the surface state of crystalline
Bi$_2$Se$_3$. These experimental results are consistent with theoretical
photoemission spectra obtained with an amorphous tight-binding model that
utilizes a realistic amorphous structure. This discovery of amorphous materials
with topological properties uncovers an overlooked subset of topological matter
outside the current classification scheme, enabling a new route to discover
materials that can enhance the development of scalable topological devices.

exploration of the fundamental laws of nature and for the search for physics
beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Measurements of molecules
composed of naturally occurring nuclei have provided the most stringent upper
bounds to the electron electric dipole moment to date, and offer a route to
investigate the violation of fundamental symmetries with unprecedented
sensitivity. Radioactive molecules - where one or more of their atoms possesses
a radioactive nucleus - can contain heavy and deformed nuclei, offering
superior sensitivity for EDM measurements as well as for other
symmetry-violating effects. Radium monofluoride, RaF, is of particular interest
as it is predicted to have an appropriate electronic structure for direct laser
cooling. Furthermore, some Ra isotopes are known to be octupole deformed,
thereby resulting in a large enhancement of their symmetry-violating nuclear
moments. Until now,however, no experimental measurements of RaF have been
performed, and their study is impeded by major experimental challenges, as no
stable isotopes of radium exist. Here, we present a novel experimental approach
to study short-lived radioactive molecules using the highly sensitive collinear

first time, the energetically low-lying electronic states for each of the
isotopically pure RaF molecules at the ISOLDE-CERN. Our results provide strong
evidence of the existence of a suitable laser-cooling scheme for these

understand the importance of density-predictor relationships, and the
uncertainty associated with the estimated conditional mean densities, defined
as conditional Fr\'echet means under a suitable metric. Using the Wasserstein
geometry of optimal transport, we consider the Fr\'echet regression of density
curve responses and develop tests for global and partial effects, as well as
simultaneous confidence bands for estimated conditional mean densities. The
asymptotic behavior of these objects is based on underlying functional central
limit theorems within Wasserstein space, and we demonstrate that they are
asymptotically of the correct size and coverage, with uniformly strong

commonplace. The use of multiple receiver coils increases the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) and enables accelerated parallel imaging methods. Some of these
methods, like GRAPPA or SPIRiT, yield individual coil images in the k-space
domain which need to be combined to form a final image. Coil combination is
often the last step of the image reconstruction, where the root sum of squares
(rSOS) is frequently used. This straightforward method works well for coil
images with high SNR, but can yield problems in images with artifacts or low
SNR in all individual coils. We aim to analyze the final coil combination step
in the framework of linear compression, including principal component analysis
(PCA). With two data sets, a simulated and an in-vivo, we use random
projections as a representation of the whole space of orthogonal projections.
This allows us to study the impact of linear compression in the image space
with diverse measures of reconstruction accuracy. In particular, the $L_2$
error, variance, SNR, and visual results serve as performance measures to
describe the final image quality. We study their relationships and observe that
the $L_2$ error and variance strongly correlate, but as expected minimal $L_2$
error does not necessarily correspond to the best visual results. In terms of
visual evaluation and SNR, the compression with PCA outperforms all other
methods, including rSOS on the uncompressed image space data.

dispersion in complex environments, such as in various terrestrial and marine
canopy flows. However, due to a lack of empirical data, it is still not
understood how particular features of highly inhomogeneous canopy flows affect
the Lagrangian statistics. In this work, we study Lagrangian short time
statistics by analyzing empirical Lagrangian trajectories in sub-volumes of
space that are small in comparison with the canopy height. For the analysis we
used 3D Lagrangian trajectories measured in a dense canopy flow model in a
wind-tunnel, using an extended version of real-time 3D particle tracking
velocimetry (3D-PTV). One of our key results is that the random turbulent
fluctuations due to the intense dissipation were more dominant than the flow's
inhomogeneity in affecting the short-time Lagrangian statistics. This amounts
to a so-called quasi-homogeneous regime of Lagrangian statistics at small
scales. Using the Lagrangian dataset we calculate the Lagrangian
autocorrelation function and the second-order Lagrangian structure-function,
and extract associated parameters, namely a Lagrangian velocity decorrelation
timescale, $T_i$, and the Kolmogorov constant, $C_0$. We demonstrate that in
the quasi-homogeneous regime, both these functions are well represented using a
second-order Lagrangian stochastic model that was designed for homogeneous
flows. Furthermore, we show that the spatial variations of the Lagrangian
separation of scales, $T_i/\tau_\eta$, and the Kolmogorov constant, $C_0$,
cannot be explained by the variation of the Reynolds number, $Re_\lambda$, in
space, and that $T_i/\tau_\eta$ was small as compared with homogeneous
turbulence predictions at similar $Re_\lambda$. We thus hypothesize that this
occurred due to the so-called ""wake production"", and show empirical results
supporting our hypothesis.

Most of all, zfit provides a well defined high-level API and workflow for
advanced model building and fitting, together with an implementation on top of
TensorFlow, allowing a transparent usage of CPUs and GPUs. It is designed to be
extendable in a very simple fashion, allowing the usage of cutting-edge
developments from the scientific Python ecosystem in a transparent way. The
main features of zfit are introduced, and its extension to data analysis,
especially in the context of HEP experiments, is discussed.

potential, once extrapolated up to high scales, develops a minimum of negative
energy density. This has important cosmological implications. In particular,
during inflation, quantum fluctuations could have pushed the Higgs field beyond
its potential barrier, triggering the formation of anti-de Sitter regions, with
fatal consequences for our universe. By requiring that this did not happen, one
can in principle connect (and constrain) Standard Model parameters with the
energy scale of inflation. In this context, we highlight the sensitivity of the
fate of our vacuum to seemingly irrelevant physics. In particular, the
departure of inflation from an exact de Sitter phase, as well as
Planck-suppressed derivative operators, can, already and surprisingly, play a
decisive role in (de)stabilizing the Higgs during inflation. Furthermore, in
the stochastic dynamics, we quantify the impact of the amplitude of the noise
differing from the one of a massless field, as well as of going beyond the
slow-roll approximation by using a phase-space approach. On a general ground,
our analysis shows that relating the period of inflation to precision particle
physics requires a knowledge of these ""irrelevant"" effects.

deal with it. Unfortunately, the apparent ease of application of these initial
approaches may make their possible flaws seem to be inherent to the problem and
often no alternative ways to solve it are searched for. For instance, since
linear systems of differential equations are easy to integrate, Poincar\'e
half-maps for piecewise linear systems are always studied by using the direct
integration of the system in each zone of linearity. However, this approach is
accompanied by two important defects: due to the different spectra of the
involved matrices, many cases and strategies must be considered and, since the
flight time appears as a new variable, nonlinear complicated equations arise.
  This manuscript is devoted to present a novel theory to characterize
Poincar\'e half-maps in planar linear systems that avoids the computation of
their solutions and the problems it causes. This new perspective rests on the
use of line integrals of a specific conservative vector field which is
orthogonal to the flow of the linear system. Besides the obvious mathematical
interest, this approach is attractive because it allows to simplify the study
of piecewise-linear systems and deal with open problems in this field.

constrained from data using dispersion relations, for a full evaluation of its
contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $(g-2)_\mu$ also
mixed- and high-energy regions need to be estimated. Both can be addressed
within the operator product expansion (OPE), either for configurations where
all photon virtualities become large or one of them remains finite. Imposing
such short-distance constraints (SDCs) on the HLbL tensor is thus a major
aspect of a model-independent approach towards HLbL scattering. Here, we focus
on longitudinal SDCs, which concern the amplitudes containing the
pseudoscalar-pole contributions from $\pi^0$, $\eta$, $\eta'$. Since these
conditions cannot be fulfilled by a finite number of pseudoscalar poles, we
consider a tower of excited pseudoscalars, constraining their masses and
transition form factors from Regge theory, the OPE, and phenomenology.
Implementing a matching of the resulting expressions for the HLbL tensor onto
the perturbative QCD quark loop, we are able to further constrain our
calculation and significantly reduce its model dependence. We find that
especially for the $\pi^0$ the corresponding increase of the HLbL contribution
is much smaller than previous prescriptions in the literature would imply.
Overall, we estimate that longitudinal SDCs increase the HLbL contribution by
$\Delta a_\mu^\text{LSDC}=13(6)\times 10^{-11}$. This number does not include
the contribution from the charm quark, for which we find
$a_\mu^{c\text{-quark}}=3(1)\times 10^{-11}$.

Distance Vector protocol which offers security against various forms of routing
attacks. Still, there are various attacks(as rank, version attacks and many

unencrypted control frames, centralized root controller, compromised or
unauthenticated devices and many more ways. There are various solutions present
in the literature but every solution has its pros and cons. There is no
appropriate system framework till now which completely solves these all issues.
So, we present an ultimate approach to mitigate these RPL attacks more
efficiently and effectively. We use IDS based system for internal attacks and a
mini-firewall for removing the external attacks. In IDS based approach, we use
intrusion detection system at multiple locations for analyzing the behaviour of
nodes. The final decision whether the node is attacker or not depends on mainly
three things as: trust between the neighbouring nodes, local decision by
multiple sink nodes and global decision by root node. We also use some
blockchain features in this framework for better internal security. We use some
threshold values and rules in mini-firewall for removing external attacks. In
this paper, we provide the proposed approach and theoretical analysis of this
approach which provide better protection from these attacks than any other
method.

First, we propose an iterative pick-place action space that encodes the
conditional relationship between picking and placing on deformable objects. The
explicit structural encoding enables faster learning under complex object
dynamics. Second, instead of jointly learning both the pick and the place
locations, we only explicitly learn the placing policy conditioned on random
pick points. Then, by selecting the pick point that has Maximal Value under
Placing (MVP), we obtain our picking policy. This provides us with an informed
picking policy during testing, while using only random pick points during
training. Experimentally, this learning framework obtains an order of magnitude
faster learning compared to independent action-spaces on our suite of
deformable object manipulation tasks with visual RGB observations. Finally,
using domain randomization, we transfer our policies to a real PR2 robot for
challenging cloth and rope coverage tasks, and demonstrate significant
improvements over standard RL techniques on average coverage.

these from the potentially hundreds of non-habitable ""false positives"" which
will also be detected. To maximize the efficiency of follow-up observations, a
prioritization scheme must be developed to determine which planets are most
likely to be EECs. In this paper, we present a Bayesian method for estimating
the likelihood that any directly imaged extrasolar planet is a true exo-Earth
candidate by interpreting the planet's apparent magnitude and separation in
light of existing exoplanet statistics. As a specific application of this
general framework, we use published estimates of the discovery yield of future
space-based direct imaging mission concepts to conduct ""mock surveys"" in which
we compute the likelihood that each detected planet is an EEC. We find that it
will be difficult to determine which planets are EECs with $>50\%$ confidence
using single-band photometry immediately upon their detection. The best way to
reduce this ambiguity would be to constrain the planet's orbit by revisiting
the system multiple times or through a radial velocity precursor survey.
Astrometric or radial velocity constraints on the planet's mass would offer a
lesser benefit. Finally, we show that a Bayesian approach to prioritizing
targets would improve the follow-up efficiency of a direct imaging survey
versus a blind approach using the same data. For example, the prioritized
approach could reduce the amount of integration time required for the spectral
detection (or rejection) of water absorption in most EECs by a factor of two.

depletion level of P. In order to overcome this problem, we study P-bearing
species in diffuse/translucent clouds. In these objects phosphorus is mainly in
the gas phase and therefore the elemental initial abundance needed in our
chemical simulations corresponds to the cosmic one and is thus well
constrained. An advanced chemical model with an updated P-chemistry network has
been used. Single-pointing observations were performed with the IRAM 30m
telescope towards the line of sight to the blazar B0355+508 aiming for the
(2-1) transitions of PN, PO, HCP and CP. This line of sight incorporates five

According to our best-fit model, the most abundant P-bearing species are HCP

($\sim10^{-11}$). We show that the production of P-bearing species is favoured
towards translucent rather than diffuse clouds, where the environment provides
a stronger shielding from the interstellar radiation. Based on our improved

time extending between the black-hole horizon and future null infinity, while
keeping track of the underlying degrees of freedom. Then, we express the
Teukolsky equation in terms of these generic coordinates with focus on
applications in both the time and frequency domains. Specifically, we derive a
wave-like equation in $2+1$ dimensions, whose unique solution follows directly
from the prescription of initial data (no external boundary conditions).
Moreover, we extend the hyperboloidal formulation into the frequency domain. A
comparison with the standard form of the Teukolsky equations allows us to
express the regularisation factors in terms of the hyperboloidal degrees of
freedom. In the second part, we discuss several hyperboloidal gauges for the
Kerr solution. Of particular importance, this paper introduces the minimal
gauge. The resulting expressions for the Kerr metric and underlying equations
are simple enough for eventual (semi)-analytical studies. Despite the
simplicity, the gauge has a very rich structure as it naturally leads to two
possible limits to extremality, namely the standard extremal Kerr spacetime and
its near-horizon geometry. When applied to the Teukolsky equation in the
frequency domain, we show that the minimal gauge actually provides the
spacetime counterpart of the well-known Leaver's formalism. Finally, we recast
the hyperboloidal gauges for the Kerr spacetime available in the literature
within the framework introduced here.

The Haldane-Shastry wave function or a chiral boson CFT correlator wave

that environmental quenching takes place during the early phases of cluster

the context of the electroweak phase transition (EWPT) in the minimal
scale-invariant theory. We find that the amount of supercooling generally
decreases for increasing scalar couplings. However, the stabilization of the
electroweak scale against the Planck scale requires the absence of Landau poles
in the respective energy range. Scalar couplings at the TeV scale can therefore
not become larger than $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. As a consequence, all fully
consistent parameter points predict the EWPT not to complete before the QCD
transition, which then eventually triggers the generation of the electroweak
scale. We also discuss the potential of the model to give rise to an observable
gravitational wave signature, as well as the possibility to accommodate a dark
matter candidate.

momentum using the {\sc Dark Sage} semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. For
galaxies between $ 10^{11}-10^{12} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ in stellar mass, the
model successfully predicts the observed trend whereby galaxies with more
prominent disks exhibit higher {\em stellar} disk specific angular momentum
($j_{\rm stellar, disk}$) at fixed stellar mass. However, when we include the
gas in the disk, bulge-dominated galaxies have the highest {\em total} disk
specific angular momentum ($j_{\rm total, disk}$). We attribute this to a large
contribution from an extended disk of cold gas in typical bulge-dominated
galaxies. We find the relationship between $j_{\rm dark matter}$ and morphology
to be quite complex. Surprisingly, in this stellar mass range, not only do
bulge-dominated galaxies tend to live in halos with higher $j_{\rm dark
matter}$ than disk-dominated galaxies, but intermediate galaxies (those with
roughly equal fractions of bulge and disk mass) have the lowest $j_{\rm dark
matter}$ of all. Yet, when controlling for halo mass, rather than stellar mass,
the relationship between $j_{\rm dark matter}$ and morphology vanishes. Based
on these results, halo mass rather than angular momentum is the main driver of
the predicted morphology sequence at high masses. In fact, in our stellar mass
range, disk-dominated galaxies live in dark matter halos that are roughly
1/10th the mass of their bulge-dominated counterparts.

50 Mpc) galaxies, as observed by NASA's WISE and GALEX missions. These maps
have matched resolution (FWHM 7.5'' and 15''), matched astrometry, and a common
procedure for background removal. We demonstrate that they agree well with
resolved intensity measurements and integrated photometry from previous
surveys. This atlas represents the first part of a program (the z=0
Multi-wavelength Galaxy Synthesis) to create a large, uniform database of
resolved measurements of gas and dust in nearby galaxies. The images and
associated catalogs are publicly available at the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science
Archive. This atlas allows us estimate local and integrated star formation
rates (SFRs) and stellar masses (M$_\star$) across the local galaxy population
in a uniform way. In the appendix, we use the population synthesis fits of
Salim et al. (2016, 2018) to calibrate integrated M$_\star$ and SFR estimators
based on GALEX and WISE. Because they leverage an SDSS-base training set of
>100,000 galaxies, these calibrations have high precision and allow us to
rigorously compare local galaxies to Sloan Digital Sky Survey results. We
provide these SFR and M$_\star$ estimates for all galaxies in our sample and
show that our results yield a ""main sequence"" of star forming galaxies
comparable to previous work. We also show the distribution of intensities from
resolved galaxies in NUV-to-WISE1 vs. WISE1-to-WISE3 space, which captures much
of the key physics accessed by these bands.

over a finite field with a fixed coordinate system. Such a code is said to be
locally recoverable with locality $r$ if, for every coordinate, its value at a
codeword can be deduced from the value of (certain) $r$ other coordinates of
the codeword. These codes have found many recent applications, e.g., to
distributed cloud storage. We will discuss the problem of constructing good
locally recoverable codes and present some constructions using algebraic
surfaces that improve previous constructions and sometimes provide codes that
are optimal in a precise sense. The main conceptual contribution of this paper
is to consider surfaces fibered over a curve in such a way that each recovery
set is constructed from points in a single fiber. This allows us to use the
geometry of the fiber to guarantee the local recoverability and use the global
geometry of the surface to get a hold on the standard parameters of our codes.
We look in detail at situations where the fibers are rational or elliptic
curves and provide many examples applying our methods.

these patterns in the well-known $\mathbb{Z}_6$-II orbifold geometry and then
we generalize them to all other $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifold geometries. Our
contrast patterns have a clear physical interpretation and are easy to check
for a given string model. Hence, they can be used to scale down the potentially
interesting area in the landscape, which significantly enhances the search for
MSSM-like models. Thus, by deploying the knowledge gain from contrast mining
into a new search algorithm we create many novel MSSM-like models, especially
in corners of the landscape that were hardly accessible by the conventional
search algorithm, for example, MSSM-like $\mathbb{Z}_6$-II models with

(inelastic) Enskog kinetic theory. The suspension is modeled as an ensemble of
solid particles where the influence of the interstitial gas on grains is via a
viscous drag force plus a stochastic Langevin-like term defined in terms of a
background temperature. In the absence of spatial gradients, it is shown first
that the system reaches a homogeneous steady state where the energy lost by
inelastic collisions and viscous friction is compensated for by the energy
injected by the stochastic force. Once the homogeneous steady state is
characterized, a \emph{normal} solution to the set of Enskog equations is
obtained by means of the Chapman--Enskog expansion around the \emph{local}
version of the homogeneous state. To first-order in spatial gradients, the
Chapman--Enskog solution allows us to identify the Navier--Stokes transport
coefficients associated with the mass, momentum, and heat fluxes. In addition,
the first-order contributions to the partial temperatures and the cooling rate
are also calculated. Explicit forms for the diffusion coefficients, the shear
and bulk viscosities, and the first-order contributions to the partial
temperatures and the cooling rate are obtained in steady-state conditions by
retaining the leading terms in a Sonine polynomial expansion. The results show
that the dependence of the transport coefficients on inelasticity is clearly
different from that found in its granular counterpart (no gas phase). The

of the estimation. In particular, it is illustrated that the QFI trapping or
saturation may occur if the qubit is subjected to a strong rotating field.
Moreover, we discuss how the azimuthal direction of the rotating field can be
estimated using only the qubit not affected by that field and investigate the
conditions under which this strategy is more efficient than use of the qubit
locally interacting with the adiabatically rotating field. Interestingly, in
the one-qubit scenario, it was found that when the rotating field is weak, the
best estimation is achieved by subjecting the probe to a static magnetic field.

  (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada",,,"R-49","cs.AI stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the most common mistakes made when performing data analysis is
attributing causal meaning to regression coefficients. Formally, a causal
effect can only be computed if it is identifiable from a combination of
observational data and structural knowledge about the domain under
investigation (Pearl, 2000, Ch. 5). Building on the literature of instrumental
variables (IVs), a plethora of methods has been developed to identify causal
effects in linear systems. Almost invariably, however, the most powerful such
methods rely on exponential-time procedures. In this paper, we investigate
graphical conditions to allow efficient identification in arbitrary linear
structural causal models (SCMs). In particular, we develop a method to
efficiently find unconditioned instrumental subsets, which are generalizations
of IVs that can be used to tame the complexity of many canonical algorithms
found in the literature. Further, we prove that determining whether an effect
can be identified with TSID (Weihs et al., 2017), a method more powerful than
unconditioned instrumental sets and other efficient identification algorithms,
is NP-Complete. Finally, building on the idea of flow constraints, we introduce
a new and efficient criterion called Instrumental Cutsets (IC), which is able
to solve for parameters missed by all other existing polynomial-time
algorithms.

produced in accelarators, lead to the formation of a new state of matter: the
quark gluon plasma (QGP). This deconfined QCD matter is expected to exist just
for very short times after the collision. All the information one can get about
the plasma is obtained from the particles that reach the detectors. Among them,
heavy vector mesons are particularly important. The abundance of $ c {\bar c}$
and $b {\bar b}$ states produced in a heavy ion collision is a source of
information about the plasma. In contrast to the light mesons, that completely
dissociate when the plasma is formed, heavy mesons presumably undergo a partial
thermal dissociation. The dissociation degree depends on the temperature and
also on the presence of magnetic fields and on the density (chemical
potential). So, in order to get information about the plasma out of the
quarkonium abundance data, one needs to resort to models that provide the
dependence of the dissociation degree on these factors. Holographic
phenomenological models provide a nice description for charmonium and
bottomonium quasi-states in a plasma. In particular, quasi-normal modes
associated with quarkonia states have been studied recently for a plasma with
magnetic fields. Here we extend this analysis of quasinormal models to the case
when charmonium and bottomonium are inside a plasma with finite density. The
complex frequencies obtained are then compared with a Breit Wigner
approximation for the peaks of the corresponding thermal spectral functions, in
order to investigate the quantitative agreement of the different descriptions
of quarkonium quasi-states.

been studied. Having in mind recent observational data, we have treated the
problem as a deviation from Kottler space-time. This deviation is measured by a
perturbation parameter $\varepsilon$ included in the equation of state
parameter of quintessence as $\omega_q=-1+\frac{1}{3}\varepsilon$. Here, the
deflection angle is calculated and then the result is compared with
\cite{Arakida:2011th} in the limit $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$ where the
quintessence behaves like the cosmological constant. It is shown that unlike
the cosmological constant, the effect of quintessence on the photon energy
equation can not be absorbed into the definition of impact parameter. Moreover
in this paper, we generalize the Kiselev black hole to the case that there is a
modified Chaplygin gas as the dark energy component of the universe and show
that the resulted metric can be reduced to the Kiselev metric by adjusting some

sites within the LTER (Long-Term Ecosystem Research) network are representative
of various types of ecosystems and span a wide bioclimatic and elevational

long-term ecological studies in mountain ecosystems at 20 LTER sites in Italy,

temperature and snow cover duration, in relation to vascular species
composition, plant traits, abundance patterns, pedoclimate, nutrient dynamics
in soils and water, phenology and composition of freshwater biota. The overall
results highlight the rapid response of mountain ecosystems to climate change.
As temperatures increased, vegetation cover in alpine and subalpine summits
increased as well. Years with limited snow cover duration caused an increase in
soil temperature and microbial biomass during the growing season. Effects on
freshwater ecosystems were observed, in terms of increases in solutes,
decreases in nitrates and changes in plankton phenology and benthos
communities. This work highlights the importance of comparing and integrating
long-term ecological data collected in different ecosystems, for a more
comprehensive overview of the ecological effects of climate change.
Nevertheless, there is a need for i) adopting co-located monitoring site
networks to improve our ability to obtain sound results from cross-site
analysis, ii) carrying out further studies, with fine spatial and temporal
resolutions to improve understanding of responses to extreme events, and iii)
increasing comparability and standardizing protocols across networks to clarify

corresponding electron-electron pair distribution functions are compared with
the results of path integral Monte Carlo simulations, showing good agreement

approximate potentials of mean force which describe the effective screened
interaction between electrons. Significant deviations from Debye-H\""uckel
screening are present at temperatures and densities relevant to high energy
density experiments involving warm and hot dense plasmas. The presence of

system from high-resolution spectra obtained with Keck/HIRES. Owing to the low
signal-to-noise ratio of the data, our analysis is based on a coaddition of the
spectra of 18 member stars. We are able to determine integrated abundance
ratios for 16 species of 14 elements, of $\alpha$-elements (Mg,Si,Ca,Ti),
Fe-peak (Sc,Mn,Cr,Ni,Cu,and Zn), and n-capture elements (Y,Ba). While the mean
Na abundance is found to be slightly enhanced and halo-like, our method does
not allow us to probe an abundance spread that would be expected in this light
element if multiple populations are present in Pal 13. We find a metal-poor
mean metallicity of $-1.91\pm0.05$ (statistical) $\pm$ 0.22 (systematic),
confirming that Pal 13 is a typical metal-poor representative of the outer
halo. While there are some differences between individual $\alpha$-elements,
such as halo-like Mg and Si versus the mildly lower Ca and Ti abundances, the
mean [$\alpha$/Fe] of 0.34$\pm$0.06 is consistent with the marginally lower
$\alpha$ component of the halo field and GC stars. We discuss our results in
the context of other objects in the outer halo and consider which of these
objects were likely accreted. We also discuss the properties of their
progenitors. While chemically, Pal 13 is similar to Gaia-Enceladus and some of
its GCs, this is not supported by its kinematic properties. Moreover, its
chemodynamical similarity with NGC 5466, a progeny of the Sequoia accretion
event, might indicate a common origin in this progenitor. However, the
ambiguities in the full abundance space of this comparison emphasize the
difficulties in unequivocally labeling a single GC as an accreted object, let
alone assigning it to a single progenitor. (Abridged)

extends the validity of the standard 5-constraint (mass, momentum and energy)
approach and leads to the correct simulation of thermal, compressible flows
with only 39 discrete velocities in 3D. The stability of this BGK-LBM is
reinforced by relying on Knudsen-number-dependent relaxation times that are
computed analytically. Hence, high-Reynolds number, supersonic flows can be
simulated in an efficient and elegant manner. While the 1D Riemann problem
shows the ability of the proposed approach to handle discontinuities in the
zero-viscosity limit, the simulation of the flow past a NACA0012 airfoil (Mach
number $\mathrm{Ma}=1.5$, Reynolds number $\mathrm{Re=10^4}$) confirms the
excellent behavior of this model in a low-viscosity and supersonic regime. The
proposed model is substantially more efficient than the previous 5-moment
D3Q343 DDF-LBM and opens up a whole new world of compressible flow applications
that can be realistically tackled with a purely LB approach.

between the spatial process at a future time point and the process at the

dependence in the dynamics is often captured by allowing the operator
parameters to vary temporally, or by re-fitting a model with a
temporally-invariant linear operator in a sliding window. Both procedures tend
to be excellent for prediction purposes over small time horizons, but are
generally time-consuming and, crucially, do not provide a global prior model
for the temporally-varying dynamics that is realistic. Here, we tackle these
two issues by using a deep convolution neural network (CNN) in a hierarchical
statistical IDE framework, where the CNN is designed to extract process
dynamics from the process' most recent behaviour. Once the CNN is fitted,
probabilistic forecasting can be done extremely quickly online using an
ensemble Kalman filter with no requirement for repeated parameter estimation.
We conduct an experiment where we train the model using 13 years of daily
sea-surface temperature data in the North Atlantic Ocean. Forecasts are seen to
be accurate and calibrated. A key advantage of our approach is that the CNN

verify that a pure MOHA controller is not collision-free. By adding a safety

interactions within a single session and the latter models those between items
among neighborhood sessions. Then different approaches are employed to encode
the information of two graphs according to different structures, and the

interaction between discrete particles and electromagnetic fields. It has been
successfully applied to problems across plasma physics including plasma based
acceleration, inertial confinement fusion, magnetically confined fusion, space
physics, astrophysics, high energy density plasmas. In many cases the physics
involves how relativistic particles are generated and interact with plasmas.
However, when relativistic particles stream across the grid both in vacuum and
in plasma there are many numerical issues that may arise which can lead to
incorrect physics. We present a detailed analysis of how discretized Maxwell
solvers used in PIC codes can lead to numerical errors to the fields that
surround particles that move at relativistic speeds across the grid.
Expressions for the axial electric field as integrals in k space are presented.
Two types of errors to these expressions are identified. The first arises from
errors to the numerator of the integrand and leads to unphysical fields that
are antisymmetric about the particle. The second arises from errors to the
denominator of the integrand and lead to Cerenkov like radiation in ""vacuum"".
These fields are not anti-symmetric, extend behind the particle, and cause the
particle to accelerate or decelerate depending on the solver and parameters.
The unphysical fields are studied in detail for two representative solvers -
the Yee solver and the FFT based solver. A solution for eliminating these
unphysical fields by modifying the k operator in the axial direction is also
presented. Using a customized finite difference solver, this solution was
successfully implemented into OSIRIS. Results from the customized solver are
also presented. This solution will be useful for a beam of particles that all

up to $p$ units of water among the cups, subject only to the constraint that no
cup receives more than $1$ unit of water; an emptier then removes up to $1$
unit of water from each of $p$ cups. Designing strategies for the emptier that
minimize backlog (i.e., the height of the fullest cup) is important for
applications in processor scheduling, buffer management in networks, quality of
service guarantees, and deamortization. We prove that the greedy algorithm
(i.e., the empty-from-fullest-cups algorithm) achieves backlog $O(\log n)$ for
any $p \ge 1$. This resolves a long-standing open problem for $p > 1$, and is
asymptotically optimal as long as $n \ge 2p$. If the filler is an oblivious
adversary, then we prove that there is a randomized emptying algorithm that
achieve backlog $O(\log p + \log \log n)$ with probability $1 -
2^{-\operatorname{polylog}(n)}$ for $2^{\operatorname{polylog}(n)}$ steps. This
is known to be asymptotically optimal when $n$ is sufficiently large relative

smoothed analysis of the deterministic greedy algorithm. Previously, the only
known bound on backlog for $p > 1$, and the only known randomized guarantees
for any $p$ (including when $p = 1$), required the use of resource
augmentation, meaning that the filler can only distribute at most $p(1 -

to remove $1 + \delta$ units of water from each of $p$ cups, for some
$\epsilon, \delta > 0$.

tracking becomes a critical challenge. The overhead of additional pilot
transmission at the price of spectral efficiency is shown necessary to achieve
high resilience in operation. An efficient method to deal with high dynamics of

tracking. The proposed Q-learning-based beam tracking scheme uses current/past
observations to design rewards from environments to facilitate prediction,
which significantly increases the efficiency of data transmission and beam
switching. Given the selected analog beams, the goal of digital beamforming is
to maximize the SINR. The received pilot signals are utilized to approximate
the desired signal and interference power, which yield the SINR measurements as
well as the optimal digital weights. Since the selected analog beams based on
the received power do not guarantee the hybrid beamforming achieving the
maximization SINR, we therefore reserve additional analog beams as candidates
during the beam tracking. The combination of analog beams with their digital
weights achieving the maximum SINR consequently provides the optimal solution

as a candidate for proving polynomial lower bounds on the operational time of
dynamic data structures:
  I: Preprocess a collection of sets $\vec{S} = S_1, \ldots , S_k \subseteq
[n]$, where $k=\operatorname{poly}(n)$.
  II: A set $T\subseteq [n]$ is revealed, and the data structure updates its
memory.
  III: An index $i \in [k]$ is revealed, and the data structure must determine
if $S_i\cap T=^? \emptyset$.
  P\v{a}tra\c{s}cu conjectured that any data structure for the Multiphase
problem must make $n^\epsilon$ cell-probes in either Phase II or III, and
showed that this would imply similar unconditional lower bounds on many
important dynamic data structure problems. Alas, there has been almost no
progress on this conjecture in the past decade since its introduction. We show
an $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$ cell-probe lower bound on the Multiphase problem
for data structures with general (adaptive) updates, and queries with unbounded
but ""layered"" adaptivity. This result captures all known set-intersection data
structures and significantly strengthens previous Multiphase lower bounds,
which only captured non-adaptive data structures.
  Our main technical result is a communication lower bound on a 4-party variant
of P\v{a}tra\c{s}cu's Number-On-Forehead Multiphase game, using information
complexity techniques. We also show that a lower bound on P\v{a}tra\c{s}cu's
original NOF game would imply a polynomial ($n^{1+\epsilon}$) lower bound on
the number of wires of any constant-depth circuit with arbitrary gates
computing a random $\tilde{O}(n)\times n$ linear operator $x \mapsto Ax$, a
long-standing open problem in circuit complexity. This suggests that the NOF
conjecture is much stronger than its data structure counterpart.

every cycle model with up to one leak (and at least one input and at least one

of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) with half-lives of less than 100 Myr at the
time of the formation of the solar system. The origins of all known SLRs is
heavily debated and remains uncertain, but the plausible scenarios can be
broadly separated into either local production or outside injection of stellar
nucleosynthesis products. The SLR production models are limited in part by
reliance on nuclear theory for modeling reactions that lack experimental
measurements. Reducing uncertainty on critical reaction cross sections can both
enable more precise predictions and provide constraints on physical processes
and environments in the early solar system. This goal led to the start of a
campaign for measuring production cross sections for the SLR $^{36}$Cl, where
Bowers et al. found higher cross sections for the
${}^{33}$S($\alpha$,p)$^{36}$Cl reaction than were predicted by Hauser-Feshbach
based nuclear reaction codes TALYS and NON-SMOKER. This prompted re-measurement
of the reaction at five new energies within the energy range originally
studied, resulting in data slightly above but in agreement with TALYS.
Following this, efforts began to measure cross sections for the next most
significant reaction for $^{36}$Cl production, $^{34}$S($^{3}$He,p)$^{36}$Cl.
Activations were performed to produce 9 samples between 1.11 MeV/nucleon and
2.36 MeV/nucleon. These samples were subsequently measured with accelerator
mass spectrometry at two labs. The resulting data suggest a
sharper-than-expected rise in cross sections with energy, with peak cross

various electronic properties of an important class of OSCs, i.e.,
oligothiophenes (OTs), including their HOMO and LUMO energies, excited-state
energies and associated transition dipole moments. We find that SchNet shows
the best performance for OTs of different sizes (from bithiophene to
sexithiophene), achieving average prediction errors in the range of 20-80meV
compared to the results from (time-dependent) density functional theory. We
show that SchNet also consistently outperforms shallow feed-forward neural
networks, especially in difficult cases with large molecules or limited
training data. We further show that SchNet could predict the transition dipole
moment accurately, a task previously known to be difficult for feed-forward
neural networks, and we ascribe the relatively large errors in transition
dipole prediction seen for some OT configurations to the charge-transfer
character of their excited states. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
SchNet by modeling the UV-Vis absorption spectra of OTs in dichloromethane and
a good agreement is observed between the calculated and experimental spectra.

obtaining an accurate state estimate, before transmission, we randomize
quantized sensor data using additive random vectors, and send the corrupted

Unlike previous research, for concept extraction, we use a regular expression
parser approach widely adopted in compiler construction, i.e., deterministic
finite automata (DFA). Thus, the concepts are extracted from unstructured
documents. For ontology learning, we use a frequent pattern mining approach and
employ a rule mining heuristic function to enhance its quality. This process
does not rely on predefined lexico-syntactic patterns, thus, it is applicable
for different subjects. We employ the ontology in a question-answering system
for students' content-related questions. For validation, we used textbook
questions/answers and questions from online course forums. Subject experts
rated the quality of the system's answers on a subset of questions and their
ratings were used to identify the most appropriate automatic semantic text
similarity metric to use as a validation metric for all answers. The Latent
Semantic Analysis was identified as the closest to the experts' ratings. We
compared the use of our ontology with the use of Text2Onto for the
question-answering system and found that with our ontology 80% of the questions
were answered, while with Text2Onto only 28.4% were answered, thanks to the
finer grained hierarchy our approach is able to produce.

a scalable solution in the physical layer by utilizing data that can be

situations, including those encountered in introductory physics classes:
systems with two well-delineated parts that exchange energy, eventually
reaching a shared equilibrium with a loss of mechanical or electrical energy.
Such systems can be constrained by a constant of the system (e.g., mass,
charge, momentum, or angular momentum) that uniquely determines the mechanical
or electrical energy of the equilibrium state, regardless of the dissipation
mechanism. A representative example would be a perfectly inelastic collision
between two objects in one dimension, for which momentum conservation requires
that some of the initial kinetic energy is dissipated by conversion to thermal
or other forms as the two objects reach a common final velocity. We discuss how
this feature manifests in a suite of four well-known and disparate problems
that all share a common mathematical formalism. These examples, in which the
energy dissipated during the process can be difficult to solve directly from
dissipation rates, can be approached by students in a first-year physics class
by considering conservation laws and can therefore be useful for teaching about
energy transformations and conserved quantities. We then illustrate how to
extend this method by applying it to a final example.

subjective tests, which are expensive and time-consuming processes. PEAQ
combines various physiological and psycho-acoustical properties of the human
ear to give a measure of the quality difference between a reference audio and a
test audio. The reference audio signal could be considered as a distortion-free
source, whereas the test signal is a distorted version of the reference, which
may have audible artifacts because of compression. The algorithm computes the
Model Output Variables (MOVs) which are mapped to a single quality measure,
Objective Difference Grade (ODG), using a three-layer perceptron artificial

and the proteoglycan aggrecan contribute to cartilage compression resistance
and are necessary for healthy joint function. A variety of mechanical forces
act on these complexes in the cartilage extracellular matrix, motivating the
need for a quantitative description which links their structure and mechanical
response. Studies using electron microscopy have imaged the HA-aggrecan brush
but require adsorption to a surface, dramatically altering the complex from its
native conformation. We use magnetic tweezers force spectroscopy to measure
changes in extension and mechanical response of an HA chain as aggrecan
monomers bind and form a bottlebrush. This technique directly measures changes
undergone by a single complex with time and under varying solution conditions.
Upon addition of aggrecan, we find a large swelling effect manifests when the
HA chain is under very low external tension (i.e. stretching forces less than
~1 pN). We use models of force-extension behavior to show that repulsion
between the aggrecans induces an internal tension in the HA chain. Through
reference to theories of bottlebrush polymer behavior, we demonstrate that the
experimental values of internal tension are consistent with a polydisperse
aggrecan population, likely caused by varying degrees of glycosylation. By
enzymatically deglycosylating aggrecan, we show that aggrecan glycosylation is
the structural feature which causes HA stiffening. We then construct a simple
stochastic binding model to show that variable glycosylation leads to a wide
distribution of internal tensions in HA, causing variations in the mechanics at
much longer length-scales. Our results provide a mechanistic picture of how
flexibility and size of HA and aggrecan lead to the brush architecture and
mechanical properties of this important component of cartilage.

have allowed us to make progress on a goal not fully achieved yet in nuclear
theory: a microscopic theory of nuclear fission. Even if the complete
microscopic description remains a computationally demanding task, the
information that can be provided by current calculations can be extremely
useful to guide and constrain more phenomenological approaches, which are
simpler to implement. First, a microscopic model that describes the real-time
dynamics of the fissioning system can justify or rule out some of the
approximations. Second, the microscopic approach can be used to obtain trends,
e.g., with increasing excitation energy of the fissioning system, or even to
compute observables that cannot be otherwise calculated in phenomenological
approaches or that can be hindered by the limitations of the method. We briefly
present in this contribution the time-dependent superfluid local density
approximation (TDSLDA) approach to nuclear fission, approach that has become a
very successful theoretical model in many areas of many-body research. The
TDSLDA incorporates the effects of the continuum, the dynamics of the pairing
field, and the numerical solution is implemented with controlled approximations
and negligible numerical corrections. The main part of the current contribution
will be dedicated to discussing the method, and recent results concerning the
fission dynamics. In addition, we present results on the excitation energy
sharing between the fragments, which are in agreement with a qualitative
conclusions extracted from a limited number of experimental measurements of
properties of prompt neutrons.

provide 'perfect' quadratizations, we can apply these formulas to any

examples of functions that can be quadratized using the result of this work.
For each of the 5 examples we compare the best possible quadratization we could

optimizing such a function by a factor of 2^1000 if it were to have 4000

aim of this work is to identify signatures on scales of order 100 AU. The jet
sources are off the grid domain and so it is the propagation and interaction
from ~ 20AU out to 100\,AU simulated here. We find that the molecular flow from
the orbiting source significantly disturbs the atomic jet, deflecting and
twisting the jet and disrupting the jet knots. Regions of high ionisation are
generated as the atomic jet rams through the dense molecular outflow. Synthetic
images in atomic and molecular lines are presented which demonstrate
identifying signatures. In particular, the structure within the atomic jet is
lost and H-alpha may trace the walls of the present CO cavity or where the
walls have been recently. These results provide a framework for the

These studies deal almost exclusively with regression tasks which are amenable

both single task and multitask settings. We do so by adapting techniques from
the statistical physics of disordered systems, accounting for both finite size

the validity of our theoretical results in comparison to a comprehensive suite
of numerical experiments. Our analysis provides theoretical support for the
intuition that the performance of multitask learning is determined by the

galaxy spectra, or else that comparisons be made to samples of local HII
regions in which DIG emission is not present. We find that S$_{32}$ decreases

they can achieve the sensitivity beyond that of the classical sensors. To
exploit entanglement as a resource, it is important to understand the effect of
noise because the entangled state is fragile against noise. Here, we provide a
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) model of an entangled sensor under engineered
noise: one can implement an entangled sensor under various noisy environments.
In particular, we experimentally investigate the performance of the entangled
sensor under the effect of time-inhomogeneous noisy environment with which the
entangled sensor holds potential to beat the classical sensors. Our ""entangled
sensor"" consists of a multi-spin molecule solved in isotropic liquid, and we
can perform the quantum sensing by using NMR techniques.

labeled anomaly examples and large unlabeled data (mostly normal data) have
shown largely improved performance over unsupervised methods. However, these
methods often focus on fitting abnormalities illustrated by the given anomaly
examples only (i.e.,, seen anomalies), and consequently they fail to generalize
to those that are not, i.e., new types/classes of anomaly unseen during
training. To detect both seen and unseen anomalies, we introduce a novel deep
weakly-supervised approach, namely Pairwise Relation prediction Network
(PReNet), that learns pairwise relation features and anomaly scores by
predicting the relation of any two randomly sampled training instances, in
which the pairwise relation can be anomaly-anomaly, anomaly-unlabeled, or
unlabeled-unlabeled. Since unlabeled instances are mostly normal, the relation
prediction enforces a joint learning of anomaly-anomaly, anomaly-normal, and
normal-normal pairwise discriminative patterns, respectively. PReNet can then
detect any seen/unseen abnormalities that fit the learned pairwise abnormal
patterns, or deviate from the normal patterns. Further, this pairwise approach
also seamlessly and significantly augments the training anomaly data. Empirical
results on 12 real-world datasets show that PReNet significantly outperforms
nine competing methods in detecting seen and unseen anomalies. We also
theoretically and empirically justify the robustness of our model w.r.t.
anomaly contamination in the unlabeled data. The code is available at

meta-learning tasks on many datasets and settings. On the other hand, we have
just started to understand and analyze how they are able to adapt fast to new
tasks. For example, one popular hypothesis is that the algorithms learn good
representations for transfer, as in multi-task learning. In this work, we
contribute by providing a series of empirical and theoretical studies, and
discover several interesting yet previously unknown properties of the
algorithm. We find MAML adapts better with a deep architecture even if the
tasks need only a shallow one (and thus, no representation learning is needed).
While echoing previous findings by others that the bottom layers in deep
architectures enable representation learning, we also find that upper layers
enable fast adaptation by being meta-learned to perform adaptive gradient
update when generalizing to new tasks. Motivated by these findings, we study
several meta-optimization approaches and propose a new one for learning to
optimize adaptively. Those approaches attain stronger performance in
meta-learning both shallower and deeper architectures than MAML.

state point group symmetries of the prototypical Kagom\'{e} SL candidate
ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$ (Herbertsmithite) using a combination of optical
ellipsometry and wavelength-dependent multi-harmonic optical polarimetry. We
uncover a subtle parity breaking monoclinic structural distortion at a
temperature above the nearest-neighbor exchange energy scale. Surprisingly, the
parity-breaking order parameter is dramatically enhanced upon cooling and
closely tracks the build-up of nearest-neighbor spin correlations, suggesting
that it is energetically favored by the SL state. The refined low temperature
symmetry group greatly restricts the number of viable ground states, and, in
the perturbative limit, points toward the formation of a nematic $Z_2$ striped
SL ground state - a SL analogue of a liquid crystal.

phenomenological model is that salient observables are sensitive to values of
parameters in the model. But in what sense is it undesirable to have such
'fine-tuning' of observables (and hence of the underlying model)? In this
paper, we argue that the fine-tuning can be interpreted as a shortcoming of the
explanatory capacity of the model: in particular it signals a lack of
explanatory depth. In support of this argument, we develop a schema -- for (a
certain class of) models that arise broadly in physical settings -- that
quantitatively relates fine-tuning of observables to a lack of depth of
explanations based on these models. We apply our schema in two different
settings in which, within each setting, we compare the depth of two competing
explanations. The first setting involves explanations for the Euclidean nature
of spatial slices of the universe today: in particular, we compare an
explanation provided by the big-bang model of the early 1970s (where no
inflationary period is included) with an explanation provided by a general
model of cosmic inflation. The second setting has a more phenomenological
character, where the goal is to infer from a limited sequence of data points,
using maximum entropy techniques, the underlying probability distribution from
which these data are drawn. In both of these settings we find that our analysis
favors the model that intuitively provides the deeper explanation of the
observable(s) of interest. We thus provide an account that relates two
'theoretical virtues' of models used broadly in physical settings -- namely, a
lack of fine-tuning and explanatory depth -- and argue that finely tuned models
sacrifice explanatory depth.

an excellent platform for discovering exotic phenomena associated with
metastable states, ranging from topological phase transitions to enhanced
superconductivity. In particular, the transition from 2H to 1T'-MoTe$_2$, which
was thought to be induced by high-energy photon irradiation among many other
means, has been intensely studied for its technological relevance in nanoscale
transistors. Despite the remarkable electrical performance arising from this
2H-to-1T' transition, it remains controversial whether a crystalline 1T' phase
is produced because optical signatures of this putative transition are found to
be associated with the formation of elemental Te clusters instead. Here, we
demonstrate the creation of an intrinsic 1T' lattice after irradiating a mono-
or few-layer 2H-MoTe$_2$ with a single field-enhanced terahertz pulse, whose
low photon energy limits possible structural damage by optical pulses. To
visualize the temporal evolution of this irreversible transition, we further
develop a single-shot terahertz pump-second harmonic probe technique, and we
find that the transition out of the 2H phase occurs within 10 ns after
photoexcitation. Our results not only resolve the long-standing debate over the
light-induced polymorphic transition in MoTe$_2$, they also highlight the
unique capability of strong-field terahertz pulses in manipulating the

similar tasks to adapt to novel tasks from the same distribution with few
gradient updates. With the flexibility in the choice of models, those
frameworks demonstrate appealing performance on a variety of domains such as
few-shot image classification and reinforcement learning. However, one
important limitation of such frameworks is that they seek a common
initialization shared across the entire task distribution, substantially
limiting the diversity of the task distributions that they are able to learn
from. In this paper, we augment MAML with the capability to identify the mode
of tasks sampled from a multimodal task distribution and adapt quickly through
gradient updates. Specifically, we propose a multimodal MAML (MMAML) framework,
which is able to modulate its meta-learned prior parameters according to the
identified mode, allowing more efficient fast adaptation. We evaluate the
proposed model on a diverse set of few-shot learning tasks, including
regression, image classification, and reinforcement learning. The results not
only demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in modulating the meta-learned
prior in response to the characteristics of tasks but also show that training
on a multimodal distribution can produce an improvement over unimodal training.

because of its metallic and topological nature. Here, we report the observation
of large anomalous Nernst effect in Fe3GeTe2. The anomalous Hall angle and
anomalous Nernst angle are about 0.07 and 0.09 respectively, far larger than
those in common ferromagnets. By utilizing the Mott relation, these large

the recent proposal for Fe3GeTe2 as a topological nodal line semimetal

upon the previous $O(k+1)$ bound for $p\ge 1$

At the core of our techniques is an application of \emph{Riesz-Thorin
interpolation theorem} from harmonic analysis, which might be of independent
interest to other algorithmic designs and analysis more broadly.
  As a consequence of our analysis, we provide better approximation guarantees
for several other algorithms with various time complexity. For example, to make
the algorithm of column subset selection computationally efficient, we analyze
a polynomial time bi-criteria algorithm which selects $O(k\log m)$ columns. We
show that this algorithm has an approximation ratio of $O((k+1)^{1/p})$ for
$1\le p\le 2$ and $O((k+1)^{1-1/p})$ for $p\ge 2$. This improves over the

randomness in continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). Our main contribution is a
rigorous, useful notion of what it means for an $\textit{ individual trajectory

operate in continuous time. This, together with the fact that trajectories may
or may not halt, presents challenges not encountered in more conventional
developments of algorithmic randomness.
  Although we formulate algorithmic randomness in the general context of CTMCs,
we are primarily interested in the $\textit{ computational }$ power of
stochastic chemical reaction networks, which are special cases of CTMCs. This
leads us to embrace situations in which the long-term behavior of a network
depends essentially on its initial state and hence to eschew assumptions that
are frequently made in Markov chain theory to avoid such dependencies.
  After defining the randomness of trajectories in terms of a new kind of
martingale (algorithmic betting strategy), we prove equivalent
characterizations in terms of constructive measure theory and Kolmogorov
complexity. As a preliminary application, we prove that, in any stochastic
chemical reaction network, $\textit{ every }$ random trajectory with bounded
molecular counts has the $\textit{ non-Zeno property }$ that infinitely many
reactions do not occur in any finite interval of time.

some genetic coding involving RNA had to develop. Herein, it is proposed that
the first real-coding setup was a direct one, made up of continuous
poly-tRNA-like molecules, with each tRNA-like moiety carrying, beyond and near
its 5 prime or 3 prime end, a trinucleotide site for specific amino acid
binding: the sequence and continuity of the tRNA moieties of a particular
poly-tRNA would ensure the sequence and continuity of the amino acids of the
corresponding peptide or small protein. In parallel with these particular
entities, and enhancing their peptide-forming function, a proto-ribosome and
primitive amino acid-activation system would develop. At some stage, one
critical innovation would be the appearance of RNA fragments that could tighten
several adjacent tRNA moieties together on a particular poly-tRNA molecule, by
pairing with the second trinucleotide sequence (identical to the first one
carrying the specific amino acid-binding site) situated at, or close to, the
middle of each tRNA moiety (i.e., the present anticodon site). These RNA
fragments, acting as authentic co-ribozymes in the peptide-synthesizing
apparatus, would constitute the ancestors of the present mRNAs. Later, on these
mRNA-like guiding fragments, free tRNA forms would be additionally used, first
keeping their amino acid-binding sites, then losing them in favor of a specific
amino acid attachment at a CCA arm at their 3 prime end. Finally, these latter
mechanisms would progressively prevail, leading to the modern and universal
indirect genetic coding system. Experimental and theoretical arguments are
presented and discussed in favor of such a scenario for the origin and
evolution of genetic coding.

and totally disconnected locally compact groups (""tdlc groups'""). The
permutation groups we investigate are subdegree-finite (i.e. all orbits of
point stabilisers are finite). Automorphism groups of connected, locally finite
graphs are examples of subdegree-finite permutation groups.
  The tdlc groups we investigate all have a maximal subgroup that is compact
and open. Tdlc groups with few open subgroups (recently studied by
Pierre-Emmanuel Caprace and Timoth\'ee Marquis) are examples of such groups.
  We prove a classification result, and use it to show that every closed,
subdegree-finite primitive group is a primitive subgroup of a product H Wr F_1
[X] F_2 Wr ... [X] F_{m-1} Wr F_m, where H is a closed, subdegree-finite and
primitive group that is either finite or one-ended and almost topologically
simple. The groups F_i are transitive and finite and m is finite. The product
[X] here denotes the recently discovered box product, and all wreath products
here act via their product action.
  We apply this permutational result to tdlc groups. If G is a tdlc group then
it contains a compact open subgroup V. The permutation group induced by the
action of G on the coset space G/V is called the Schlichting completion of the
pair (G,V), and is denoted G//V. Knowledge of this action of G on G/V underpins
many recent influential results in tdlc theory. We show that if V is a maximal
subgroup of G, and G is non-compact, then G//V is subject to a topological
interpretation of our result for primitive groups. We use this to show that in
this case, if G//V is nondiscrete, preserves no nontrivial homogenous cartesian
decomposition on G/V, and does not split nontrivially over a compact open
subgroup, then the monolith of G//V is a nondiscrete, one-ended, topologically
simple, compactly generated tdlc group.

nonfactorizable contributions are considered in the topologic diagram approach.
The estimation of nonfactorizable contributions from $W$-exchange and inner
$W$-emission diagrams relies on the pole model and current algebra. The
non-perturbative parameters in both factorizable and nonfactorizable parts are
calculated in the MIT bag model. Branching fractions and up-down decay
asymmetries for all the CF and SCS decays of antitriplet charmed baryons are
presented. The prediction of $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^+\to \Xi^0\pi^+ )$ agrees well
with the measurements inferred from Belle and CLEO, while the calculated ${\cal
B}(\Xi_c^0\to \Xi^-\pi^+)$ is too large compared to the recent Belle
measurement. We conclude that these two $\Xi_c\to\Xi \pi^+$ modes cannot be
simultaneously explained within the current-algebra framework for $S$-wave
amplitudes. This issue needs to be resolved in future study. The long-standing
puzzle with the branching fraction and decay asymmetry of $\Lambda_c^+\to\Xi^0
K^+$ is resolved by noting that only type-II $W$-exchange diagram will
contribute to this mode. We find that not only the calculated rate agrees with
experiment but also the predicted decay asymmetry is consistent with the
SU(3)-flavor symmetry approach in sign and magnitude. Likewise, the CF mode
$\Xi_c^0\to \Sigma^+K^-$ and the SCS decays $\Xi_c^0\to pK^-,\Sigma^+\pi^-$
proceed only through type-II $W$-exchange. They are predicted to have large and
{\it positive} decay asymmetries. These features can be tested in the near
future.

the generalization error is reduced effectively only when the measured
diversity is increased in a few specific ranges, while in other ranges larger
diversity is less beneficial to increasing the generalization of an ensemble.
Besides, we propose two pruning methods based on diversity management to
utilize this relationship, which could increase diversity appropriately and
shrink the size of the ensemble without much-decreasing performance. Empirical
results validate the reasonableness of the proposed relationship between
diversity and ensemble generalization error and the effectiveness of the
proposed pruning methods.

binary state. A sender observes a sequence of binary signals about the state
and discloses a left truncation of the sequence to a receiver in order to
convince him that the state is good. We focus on truth-leaning equilibria (cf.
Hart et al. (2017)), where the sender discloses truthfully when doing so is
optimal, and the receiver takes off-path disclosure at face value. In
equilibrium, seemingly sub-optimal truncations are disclosed, and the
disclosure contains the longest truncation that yields the maximal difference
between the number of good and bad signals. We also study a general framework
of disclosure games which is compatible with large evidence spaces, a wide
range of disclosure technologies, and finitely many states. We characterize the
unique equilibrium value function of the sender and propose a method to
construct equilibria for a broad class of games.

reflecting surface (IRS) aided non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system,
where a base station (BS) serves multiple users with the aid of IRSs. Our goal
is to maximize the sum rate of all users by jointly optimizing the active
beamforming at the BS and the passive beamforming at the IRS, subject to
successive interference cancellation decoding rate conditions and IRS
reflecting elements constraints. In term of the characteristics of reflection
amplitudes and phase shifts, we consider ideal and non-ideal IRS assumptions.
To tackle the formulated non-convex problems, we propose efficient algorithms
by invoking alternating optimization, which design the active beamforming and
passive beamforming alternately. For the ideal IRS scenario, the two
subproblems are solved by invoking the successive convex approximation
technique. For the non-ideal IRS scenario, constant modulus IRS elements are
further divided into continuous phase shifts and discrete phase shifts. To
tackle the passive beamforming problem with continuous phase shifts, a novel
algorithm is developed by utilizing the sequential rank-one constraint
relaxation approach, which is guaranteed to find a locally optimal rank-one
solution. Then, a quantization-based scheme is proposed for discrete phase
shifts. Finally, numerical results illustrate that: i) the system sum rate can
be significantly improved by deploying the IRS with the proposed algorithms;
ii) 3-bit phase shifters are capable of achieving almost the same performance
as the ideal IRS; iii) the proposed IRS-aided NOMA systems achieve higher
system sum rate than the IRS-aided orthogonal multiple access system.

  diagrams based on CSP",,,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deadlock and nondeterminism may become increasingly hard to detect in
concurrent and distributed systems. UML activity diagrams are flowcharts that
model sequential and concurrent behavior. Although the UML community widely
adopts such diagrams, there is no standard approach to verify the presence of
deadlock and nondeterministic behavior in activity diagrams. Nondeterminism is
usually neglected in the literature even though it may be considered a very
relevant property. This work proposes a framework for the automatic
verification of deadlock and nondeterminism in UML activity diagrams. It
introduces a compositional CSP semantics for activity diagrams that is used to
automatically generate CSP specifications from UML models. These specifications
are the input for the automatic verification of deadlock and nondeterministic
behavior using the FDR refinement checker. We propose a plugin for the Astah
modeling environment that mechanizes the translation process, and that calls
FDR in the background to perform the verification of properties. The tool keeps
the traceability between a diagram and its CSP specification. It parses the FDR
results to highlight the diagram paths that lead to a deadlock or a
nondeterministic behavior. This framework adds verification capabilities to the
UML modeling tool and keeps the formal semantics transparent to the users.
Therefore, the user does not need to understand or manipulate formal notations
during modeling. We present the results of a case study that applies the
proposed framework for the verification of models in the domain of cloud
computing. We discuss future applications due to the potential of our approach.

they can generalize to ego agents and environments that differ from the

from an adversary for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. We characterize the maximum covert coding rate
under a variety of settings, including different regimes where either the
number of transmit antennas or the blocklength is scaled up. We show that a
non-zero covert capacity can be achieved in the massive MIMO regime in which
the number of transmit antennas scales up but under specific conditions. Under

  for Hypotheses Discrimination and Habitability Modeling","Preprint",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ab822b",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multiple hypotheses/models have been put forward regarding the cooling
history of the Earth. The search for life beyond Earth has brought these models
into a new light as they connect to one of the two energy sources life can tap.
The ability to discriminate between different Earth cooling models, and the
utility of adopting such models to aid in the assessment of planetary
habitability, has been hampered by a lack of uncertainty analysis. This
motivates a layered uncertainty analysis for a range of thermal history models
that have been applied to the Earth. The analysis evaluates coupled model
input, initial condition, and structural uncertainty. Layered model
uncertainty, together with data uncertainty and multiple working hypotheses
(another form of uncertainty), means that results must be evaluated in a
probabilistic sense even if the models are deterministic. For the Earth's
cooling history uncertainty leads to ambiguity - multiple models, based on
different hypotheses, can match data constraints. This has implications for
using such models to forecast conditions for exoplanets that share Earth
characteristics but are older than the Earth, i.e., it has implications for
modeling the long-term life potential of terrestrial planets. Even for the most
Earth-like planet we know of, the Earth itself, model uncertainty and ambiguity
leads to large forecast spreads. Given that this comes from the planet with the
most data constraints we should expect larger spreads for models of terrestrial
planets in general. The layered uncertainty approach can be expanded by
coupling planetary cooling models to climate models and propagating uncertainty
between them to assess habitability from a probabilistic versus a binary view.

throughput optimality of the max-weight scheduling policy, with some recent
research showing that max-weight scheduling is optimal with respect to total
expected delay asymptotically in the heavy-traffic regime. However, the
question of delay-optimal scheduling in input-queued switches remains open in
general, as does the question of delay-optimal scheduling under more general
objective functions. To gain fundamental insights into these very difficult
problems, we consider a fluid model of $n \times n$ input-queued switches with
associated fluid-flow costs, and we derive an optimal scheduling control policy
to an infinite horizon discounted control problem with a general linear
objective function of fluid cost. Our optimal policy coincides with the
$c\mu$-rule in certain parameter domains. More generally, due to the
input-queued switch constraints, the optimal policy takes the form of the
solution to a flow maximization problem, after we identify the Lagrangian
multipliers of some key constraints through carefully designed algorithms.
Computational experiments demonstrate the benefits of our optimal scheduling
policy over variants of max-weight scheduling within fluid models of

central spin consisting of R spins and we apply it on the dynamics of quantum
correlations (QCs) of three interacting qubits. In order to see the impact of
the initial prepared state of the spin chain environment on the decoherence
process, we assume the spin chain environment prepared in two main ways,
namely, either the ground state or the vacuum state in the momentum space. We
develop a general heuristic analysis when the spin chain environment in
prepared in these states, in order to understand the decoherence process
against the physical parameters. We show that the decoherence process is mainly
determined by the choice of the initial prepared state, the number of spin of
the chain, the coupling strength, the anisotropy parameter and the position
from the quantum critical point. In fact, in the strong coupling regime, the
decoherence process does not appear for the environment prepared in the vacuum
state and it behaves oscillatory in the case of evolution from ground state. On
the other hand, in the weak coupling regime and far from the quantum critical
point, decoherence induced by the ground state is weaker than that of the
vacuum state. Finally, we show that, QCs are completely shielded from
decoherence in the case of evolution from the W state and obey the same
dynamics as the decoherence factors for the GHZ state.

determined through a combination of the radio lightcurve and Very Long Baseline

these techniques are complementary as they probe different parts of the
circum-merger density/inclination angle parameter space and different periods
of the temporal evolution of the afterglow. We also find that while VLBI
observations will be limited to the very closest events it will be possible to
detect scintillation for a large fraction of events beyond the range of current
gravitational wave detectors. Scintillation will also be detectable with next
generation telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array, 2000 antenna Deep
Synoptic Array and the next generation Very Large Array, for a large fraction
of events detected with third generation gravitational wave detectors. Finally,
we discuss prospects for the measurement of the $H_0$ with VLBI observations of
neutron star mergers and compare this technique to other standard siren

assessment of photophysics (static quenching, blinking-like triplet state
relaxation) influence on autocorrelation curves can be delicate if dye-labeled
objects diffuse on comparably-rapid time scales and use tryptophan as the
quencher. As our example of small-molecule dye that diffuses rapidly, we mix
quencher with Alexa 488 dye, and quenching is reflected in the fact that the
data become exceptionally noisy. This reflects the bidisperse population of
quenched and unquenched dye when the time scales overlap between the processes
of translational diffusion, quenching, and blinking. As our example of
large-molecule dye-labeled object, we mixed quencher with dye-labeled bovine
serum albumin. Diffusion, static quenching and blinking time scales are now
separated, and inferred translational diffusion now depends weakly on quencher.
We conclude that when the diffusing molecule is substantially slower to diffuse
than the time scale of photophysical processes of the fluorescent dye to which
it is attached, influence of quenching is self-evident and the FCS
autocorrelation curves give appropriate diffusion coefficient if correct
fitting functions are chosen in the analysis.

overcome the vanishing and exploding gradient problem in modeling data with
long-term dependencies. A basic question is how restrictive is the unitary
constraint on the possible input-output mappings of such a network? This work
shows that for any contractive RNN with ReLU activations, there is a URNN with
at most twice the number of hidden states and the identical input-output
mapping. Hence, with ReLU activations, URNNs are as expressive as general RNNs.
In contrast, for certain smooth activations, it is shown that the input-output
mapping of an RNN cannot be matched with a URNN, even with an arbitrary number
of states. The theoretical results are supported by experiments on modeling of
slowly-varying dynamical systems.

propose a new probabilistic modeling framework for Thompson sampling, where
local latent variable uncertainty is used to sample the mean reward.
Variational inference is used to approximate the posterior of the local

of State (EoS) $p=k\rho$, where $k$ is constant, is studied here in the

Misner-Sharp mass function, because of the introduction of such an EoS, in
terms of the compatibility of a certain pair of quasi-linear partial
differential equations, obtained from Einstein's field equations. We find that
except when this system of PDEs reduces to ODEs because of additional
symmetries imposed on the spacetimes, or when they become compatible with each
other in some special situations, consistent solution to perfect fluid collapse
with linear EoS is not available. The end state of collapse with no such
constraint of EoS has also been investigated. Since considering arbitrary
pressures in a collapsing cloud to study its end state is difficult as this
requires information about the dynamics of collapse not known in general, we
consider small perturbations to mass profiles corresponding to inhomogeneous
dust collapse. This, in turn, provides small pressure perturbations to the
otherwise pressureless fluid. The dependence of visibility or otherwise of the
singularity on initial conditions of collapse, in the presence or absence of
such perturbations is studied numerically. As long as no linear EoS is imposed

closure. These are the focus of this work, which modifies the original design

conducted a rescheduling of multiply and accumulate which are the basic

reduced by 40% for DSPs. To further increase the throughput by operating an

equations are the cornerstone formalism in stochastic control problems. The
universality of bilinear stochastic systems can be found in autonomous systems,

versus Stratonovich suggests stochastic systems embedded with Stratonovich
differential to describe the stochastic evolution of the state vector of real
physical systems. The mathematical theory of a scalar time-varying bilinear
Stratonovich stochastic differential equation is available in current texts.
The theory of scalar Stratonovich systems was developed by deriving their
closed-form solutions and then conditional moments. Practical problems obeying
vector time-varying bilinear Stratonovich stochastic differential equations are
ubiquitous. However, their formal and systematic estimation theory is not
available. In this paper, we develop the results for non-homogeneous Markov
processes obeying the vector Stratonovich bilinear stochastic differential
equation. Then, the theory of the paper is applied to a stochastic three-phase
rectifier circuit. The stochastic evolution of the rectifier state vector is
constructed by utilizing the Euler-Lagrange theory and embedding Stratonovich
differential. Since the theory of the paper accounts for the
multidimensionality as well as respects Stratonovich stochasticity of the
ubiquitous bilinear system, the estimation Theorems will be remarkably useful
to estimation and control of nonlinear real physical systems. Finally, this
paper will be of interest to control and computational practitioners aspiring
for the formal theory of bilinear stochastic systems arising from their

method for medical image segmentation. To date Unet has demonstrated
state-of-art performance in many complex medical image segmentation tasks,
especially under the condition when the training and testing data share the
same distribution (i.e. come from the same source domain). However, in clinical
practice, medical images are acquired from different vendors and centers. The
performance of a U-Net trained from a particular source domain, when
transferred to a different target domain (e.g. different vendor, acquisition
parameter), can drop unexpectedly. Collecting a large amount of annotation from
each new domain to retrain the U-Net is expensive, tedious, and practically
impossible. In this work, we proposed a generic framework to address this
problem, consisting of (1) an unpaired generative adversarial network (GAN) for
vendor-adaptation, and (2) a Unet for object segmentation. In the proposed
Unet-GAN architecture, GAN learns from Unet at the feature level that is
segmentation-specific. We used cardiac cine MRI as the example, with three
major vendors (Philips, Siemens, and GE) as three domains, while the
methodology can be extended to medical images segmentation in general. The
proposed method showed significant improvement of the segmentation results
across vendors. The proposed Unet-GAN provides an annotation-free solution to
the cross-vendor medical image segmentation problem, potentially extending a
trained deep learning model to multi-center and multi-vendor use in real

when the heat capacity of the heat source is negative, such as the black holes,
we show that the heat engine efficiency during the operation can surpass the
Carnot efficiency determined by the initial temperature of the heat sources. It
is further argued that the heat engine between two black holes with vanishing
initial temperature difference can be driven by the energy fluctuation. The

recent years owing to its applications in advancements of fundamental
understanding of nanoscale electrokinetics as well as innovative engineering
applications. A key phenomenon in this context is ion concentration
polarization (ICP) that occurs near perm-selective nanoporous membranes or
nanochannels under dc bias. In classical settings, involving voltage-driven
transport of ions through perm-selective membranes, concentration polarization
is well understood as formation of steep concentration drop to reach near zero
concentration (depletion layer) at the anodic side of cation-selective
membranes. In contrast to this classical description, we demonstrate here that
when ICP is driven in a microchannel and coupled with electroosmotic flows a
long-tailed fluorescent layer in front of diffusion layer is formed, which can
be characterized as an additional plateau in the concentration profile. Using a
micro/nanofluidic platform, in situ visualizations, and local concentration
measurements by microelectrode arrays we quantify that this plateau layer has a
concentration of 60 % of bulk electrolyte concentration, regardless of the bulk
concentration itself. Using a mathematical analysis of conservation laws for
flow, charge, and salt, we demonstrate that this plateau region is related to
the formation of a flow stagnation point due to the competition between
electro-osmotic and induced pressure driven flows. Consistent with the
experiments, this analysis predicts the plateau concentration to be 60% of the
bulk electrolyte. Thus, this plateau concentration region completes the picture
of ICP in microchannels which has drawn significant attention from the fields
of electrokinetics and micro/nanofluidics.

to 67 ps over a wide range of MLCT energies in different solvents by utilizing
the strong solvatochromism of the complexes. Intramolecular electron transfer
lifetimes governing $^3$MLCT relaxation increase monotonically and
(super)exponentially as the $^3$MLCT energy is decreased in 1 and 2 by changing
the solvent. This behavior can be described with non-adiabatic classical Marcus
electron transfer dynamics along the indirect $^3$MLCT->$^3$MC pathway, where
the $^3$MC is the lowest energy metal-centered (MC) excited state. In contrast,
the $^3$MLCT lifetime in 3 changes non-monotonically and exhibits a maximum.
This qualitatively different behaviour results from direct electron transfer
from the $^3$MLCT to the electronic ground state (GS). This pathway involves
nuclear tunnelling for the high-frequency polypyridyl skeleton mode
($\hbar\omega$ = 1530 cm$^{-1}$), which is more displaced for 3 than for either
1 or 2, therefore making the direct pathway significantly more efficient in 3.
To our knowledge, this is the first observation of an efficient $^3$MLCT->GS
relaxation pathway in an Fe polypyridyl complex. Our study suggests that
further extending the MLCT state lifetime requires (1) lowering the $^3$MLCT
state energy with respect to the $^3$MC state and (2) suppressing the
intramolecular distortion of the electron-accepting ligand in the $^3$MLCT
excited state to suppress the rate of direct $^3$MLCT->GS electron transfer.

the energy and charge transport, due to the chiral magnetic effect. On the
other hand, in a holographic many body system, the chaotic modes might be only
associated with the energy conservation. This suggests that, perhaps, one can
detect microscopic anomalies through the diagnosis of quantum chaos in such
systems. To investigate this idea, we consider a magnetized brane in AdS space
time with a Chern-Simons coupling in the bulk. By studying the shock wave
geometry in this background, we first compute the corresponding butterfly
velocities, in the presence of an external magnetic field $B$, in $\mu\ll T$
and $ B \ll T^2$ limit. We find that the butterfly propagation in the direction
of $B$ has a different velocity than in the opposite direction. The splitting
of butterfly velocities confirms the idea that chiral anomaly can be
macroscopically manifested via quantum chaos. We then show that the
pole-skipping points of energy density Green's function of the boundary theory
coincide precisely with the chaos points. This might be regarded as the
hydrodynamic origin of quantum chaos in an anomalous system. Additionally, by
studying the near horizon dynamics of a scalar field on the above background,
we find the spectrum of pole-skipping points associated with the two-point
function of dual boundary operator. We find that the sum of wavenumbers
corresponding to pole-skipping points at a specific Matsubara frequency is a
universal quantity, which is independent of the scaling dimension of the dual
boundary operator. We then show that this quantity follows from a closed
formula and can be regarded as another macroscopic manifestation of the chiral
anomaly.

dark matter subhaloes in Fermi-LAT catalogues, taking into accounts
uncertainties associated with the modelling of the Galactic subhalo population.
We use four different halo models bracketing a large set of uncertainties. For
each model, adopting an accurate detection threshold of the LAT to dark matter
subhalo signals and comparing model predictions with the number of unassociated
point-sources in Fermi-LAT catalogues, we derive upper limits on the
annihilation cross section as a function of dark matter mass. Our results show
that, even in the best-case scenario (i.e. DMonly subhalo model), which does
not include tidal disruption from baryons, the limits on the dark matter
parameter space are less stringent than current gamma-ray limits from dwarf
spheroidal galaxies. Comparing the results obtained with the different subhalo
models, we find that baryonic effects on the subhalo population are significant
and lead to dark matter constraints that are less stringent by a factor of
about 2 to 5. This uncertainty comes from the unknown resilience of dark matter
subhaloes to tidal disruption.

different analytic functions. The time durations thus determined for the sharp

(TNS) derived from a given lattice Hamiltonian is highly attractive in various
aspects. From a theoretical perspective, it can offer deep insights into the
entanglement structure and quantum information content of strongly correlated
quantum many-body states. From a practical perspective, it allows one to push
numerical efficiency by orders of magnitude. Physical expectation values based
on TNS require the full contraction of a given tensor network, with the
elementary ingredient being a pairwise contraction. While well-established for
no or just abelian symmetries, this can become quickly extremely involved and
cumbersome for general non-abelian symmetries. As shown in this work, however,
the latter can be tackled in a transparent and efficient manner by introducing
so-called X-symbols which deal with the underlying pairwise contraction of
generalized Clebsch-Gordan tensors (CGTs). These X-symbols can be computed
deterministically once and for all, and hence also be tabulated. Akin to
6j-symbols, X-symbols are generally much smaller than their constituting CGTs.
In applications, they solely affect the tensors of reduced matrix elements, and
therefore, once tabulated, allow one to completely sidestep the explicit usage
of CGTs, and thus to greatly increase numerical efficiency.

momentum-relaxing scattering due to defects and phonons. These processes can
become sufficiently weak in two-dimensional materials, giving rise to either
ballistic or hydrodynamic transport, depending on the strength of
electron-electron scattering. We show that the ballistic regime is a quantum
critical point (QCP) on the regime boundary separating Ohmic and hydrodynamic
transport. The QCP corresponds to a \emph{free} conformal field theory (CFT)
with a dynamical scaling exponent $z = 1$. Its nontrivial aspects emerge in
device geometries with shear, wherein the regime has an intrinsic universal
dissipation, a nonlocal current-voltage relation, and exhibits the critical
scaling of the underlying CFT. The Fermi surface has electron-hole pockets
across all angular scales and the current flow has \emph{vortices} at all
spatial scales. We image the fluctuations in high-definition and animate their
emergence as experimental parameters are tuned to the QCP (movie links in
comments). The vortices clearly demonstrate that Pauli exclusion alone can
produce collective effects, with low-frequency AC transport mediated by vortex
dynamics. The scale-invariant spatial structure is much richer than that of an
interaction-dominated hydrodynamic regime, which only has a single vortex at
the device scale. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for both
interaction-free and interaction-dominated non-Ohmic transport in
two-dimensional materials, as seen in several contemporary experiments.

chemical evolution of the Interestellar Medium (ISM). However, obtaining
reliable TK estimates usually requires expensive observations including the
combination of multi-line analysis and dedicated radiative transfer
calculations. Aims. This work explores the use of HCN and HNC observations, and
particularly its I(HCN)/I(HNC) intensity ratio of their J=1-0 lines, as direct
probe of the gas kinetic temperature in the molecular ISM. Methods. We obtained
a new set of large-scale observations of both HCN and HNC (1-0) lines along the
Integral Shape Filament (ISF) in Orion. In combination with ancillary gas and
dust temperature measurements, we find a systematic temperature dependence of
the observed I(HCN)/I(HNC) intensity ratio across our maps. Additional
comparisons with chemical models demonstrate that these observed I(HCN)/I(HNC)
variations are driven by the effective destruction and isomerization mechanisms
of HNC under low energy barriers. Results. The observed variations of
I(HCN)/I(HNC) with TK can be described with a two-part linear function. This
empirical calibration is then used to create a temperature map of the entire
ISF. Comparisons with similar dust temperature measurements in this cloud, as
well as in other regions and galactic surveys, validate this simple technique
to obtain direct estimates of the gas kinetic temperature in a wide range of
physical conditions and scales with an optimal working range between 15 K and

pyrene end group and a poly (D-lactide) (PDLA) chain (Pyr-D), capable of
interacting with the surface of GNP layers as well as forming stereoblocks
during the ring opening polymerization (ROP) of L-lactide, were used. The
nanocomposites were synthesized by adding to L-lactide the GNP/initiator
system, prepared by dispersing the graphite in the acetone/Pyr-D solution,
which was dried after the sonication process. DSC and X-ray diffraction
measurements evidenced the stereocomplexation of the systems synthesized by
using the pyrene-based initiators, whose extent turned out to depend on the
PDLA chain length. All the prepared nanocomposites - including those
synthesized starting from a classical initiator, that is 1-dodecanol - retained
similar electrical conductivity, whereas the thermal conductivity was found to
increase in the stereocomplexed samples. Preferential localization of
stereocomplexed PLA close to the interface with GNP was demonstrated by
Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) techniques, supporting for an important role of
local crystallinity in the thermal conductivity of the nanocomposites.

modified from the left-handed (LH) mode to the right-handed (RH) mode. The
theoretical instability analysis shows that the growth rate of this RH
non-resonant mode may be smaller than it of the LH resonant mode. However the
LH resonant mode can be ignored in our experiment while the expected wavelength

support this contention and the occurrence of non-resonant streaming

million women worldwide had been diagnosed from breast cancer. This study
presents a computer-aided diagnosis system based on convolutional neural
networks as an alternative diagnosis methodology for breast cancer diagnosis
with thermal images. Experimental results showed that lower false-positives and
false-negatives classification rates are obtained when data pre-processing and
data augmentation techniques are implemented in these thermal images.
Background: There are many types of breast cancer screening techniques such as,
mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound and blood sample tests,
which require either, expensive devices or personal qualified. Currently, some
countries still lack access to these main screening techniques due to economic,
social or cultural issues. The objective of this study is to demonstrate that
computer-aided diagnosis(CAD) systems based on convolutional neural networks
(CNN) are faster, reliable and robust than other techniques. Methods: We
performed a study of the influence of data pre-processing, data augmentation
and database size versus a proposed set of CNN models. Furthermore, we
developed a CNN hyper-parameters fine-tuning optimization algorithm using a
tree parzen estimator. Results: Among the 57 patients database, our CNN models
obtained a higher accuracy (92\%) and F1-score (92\%) that outperforms several
state-of-the-art architectures such as ResNet50, SeResNet50 and Inception.
Also, we demonstrated that a CNN model that implements data-augmentation
techniques reach identical performance metrics in comparison with a CNN that
uses a database up to 50\% bigger. Conclusion: This study highlights the
benefits of data augmentation and CNNs in thermal breast images. Also, it
measures the influence of the database size in the performance of CNNs.

a significantly higher efficiency in nanopapers heat transfer, in particular
through the thickness of the nanopaper. This is explained by a thermal bridging
effect of crystalline domains between overlapped GnP, promoting heat transfer

enhance the physical properties of contacts within a percolating network of GRM

interstellar medium. The source of this turbulence, however, is still poorly
understood. Previous work suggests that compression caused by supernova
shockwaves, gravity, or cloud collisions, may drive the turbulence to some
extent. In this work, we present three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) simulations of contraction in turbulent, magnetized clouds from the warm
neutral medium (WNM) of the ISM to the formation of cold dense molecular
clouds, including radiative heating and cooling. We study different contraction
rates and find that observed molecular cloud properties, such as the
temperature, density, Mach number, and magnetic field strength, and their
respective scaling relations, are best reproduced when the contraction rate
equals the turbulent turnover rate. In contrast, if the contraction rate is
significantly larger (smaller) than the turnover rate, the compression drives
too much (too little) turbulence, producing unrealistic cloud properties. We
find that the density probability distribution function evolves from a double
log-normal representing the two-phase ISM, to a skewed, single log-normal in
the dense, cold phase. For purely hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the
effective driving parameter of contracting cloud turbulence is natural to
mildly compressive (\mbox{$b\sim0.4$--$0.5$}), while for MHD turbulence, we
find \mbox{$b\sim0.3$--$0.4$}, i.e., solenoidal to naturally mixed. Overall,
the physical properties of the simulated clouds that contract at a rate equal
to the turbulent turnover rate, indicate that large-scale contraction may
explain the origin and evolution of turbulence in the ISM.

formal verification. In the basic setting, these games are two-player,
turn-based, and played under perfect information on directed graphs, whose
nodes are labeled with priorities. The winner of a play is determined according
to the parities (even or odd) of the minimal priority occurring infinitely
often in that play. The problem of finding a winning strategy in parity games
is known to be in UPTime $\cap$ CoUPTime and deciding whether a polynomial time
solution exists is a long-standing open question. In the last two decades, a
variety of algorithms have been proposed. Many of them have been also
implemented in a platform named PGSolver. This has enabled an empirical
evaluation of these algorithms and a better understanding of their relative
merits. In this paper, we further contribute to this subject by implementing,
for the first time, an algorithm based on alternating automata. More precisely,
we consider an algorithm introduced by Kupferman and Vardi that solves a parity
game by solving the emptiness problem of a corresponding alternating parity
automaton. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that this algorithm
outperforms other algorithms when the game has a a small number of priorities
relative to the size of the game. In many concrete applications, we do indeed
end up with parity games where the number of priorities is relatively small.
This makes the new algorithm quite useful in practice.

intermediate states $|B^1\Pi, v=8\rangle$ and $|c^3\Sigma^+, v=30\rangle$

$\tau$ during which the detector records neutrino events. In this context we
are motivated by accelerator-neutrino oscillation experiments where data taking

understanding the coevolution between the supermassive black hole and its host
galaxy. The great difference of dynamical ranges from small-scale accretion
disk simulations to large-scale or cosmological simulations places barriers to
track wind kinematics. In the first paper of this series, we have studied the
dynamics of disk winds from the outer edge of the accretion disk toward galaxy
scales in the hydrodynamical framework. In this paper, we further incorporate
magnetic fields to understand the wind dynamics by adopting one-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) model, with boundary conditions set for hot
accretion flows. The geometry of poloidal magnetic field is prescribed as a
straight line with an angle $\theta=45^\circ$ from the rotational axis, and the
strength satisfies the divergence free condition. The wind solution is achieved
through requesting gas to pass through the slow, Alfv\'{e}n and fast
magneto-sonic points smoothly. Physical quantities are found to show a
power-law dependence on cylindrical radius $R$ beyond the fast magneto-sonic
point, for which $\rho \propto R^{-2}, v_{\rm p}\propto {\rm const.}, v_{\rm
\phi}\propto R^{-1}, B_{\rm \phi}\propto R^{-1},$ and $ \beta \propto
\rho^{\gamma-1}$. The magnetization of wind is dominant in determining the wind
properties. The wind is accelerated to a greater terminal velocity with strong
magnetization ($v_{\rm Ap0}>1$) compared to the hydrodynamical case, which the
magnetic pressure gradient dominates and the centrifugal potential converts to
the kinetic energy. The dependance of wind physical quantities on
magnetization, temperature, field line angular velocity, and adiabatic index is
also discussed.

showing that the (classical) Cauchy problem for the wave equation is well-posed

spectral and statistical properties of the radiation considerably depart from
the known phenomenology of HHG. Finding such regimes in HHG could lead to novel
sources of attosecond light with intrinsically quantum statistics such as
squeezing and entanglement. In this work, we present a fully quantum
electrodynamical theory of extreme nonlinear optics with which we predict new
quantum effects that alter both spectral and statistical properties of HHG. We
predict the emission of shifted frequency combs resulting from transitions
between perturbed states of the driven atom, and identify new spectral features
that arise from the breakdown of the dipole approximation for the emission.
Moreover, we find that each HHG emitted photon is a superposition of all
frequencies in the spectrum - e.g., HHG creates single photon combs. We also
describe how the HHG process changes in the single atom regime, and discuss how
our various predictions can be tested experimentally. Our approach is also
applicable to a wide range of nonlinear optical processes, paving the way
toward novel quantum information techniques in the EUV and X-ray, and in
ultrafast quantum optics.

  analysis and applications",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the past decades, multigrid methods for linear systems having multilevel
Toeplitz coefficient matrices with scalar entries have been largely studied. On
the other hand, only few papers have investigated the case of block entries,
where the entries are small generic matrices instead of scalars. In that case
the efforts of the researchers have been mainly devoted to specific
applications, focusing on algorithmic proposals but with very marginal
theoretical results.
  In this paper, we propose a general two-grid convergence analysis proving an
optimal convergence rate independent of the matrix size, in the case of
positive definite block Toeplitz matrices with generic blocks. In particular,
the proof of the approximation property has not a straightforward
generalization of the scalar case and in fact we have to require a specific
commutativity condition on the block symbol of the grid transfer operator.
Furthermore, we define a class of grid transfer operators satisfying the
previous theoretical conditions and we propose a strategy to insure fast
multigrid convergence even for more than two grids.
  Among the numerous applications that lead to the block Toeplitz structure,
high order Lagrangian finite element methods and staggered discontinuous
Galerkin methods are considered in the numerical results, confirming the
effectiveness of our proposal and the correctness of the proposed theoretical
analysis.

the propagation from a single-antenna transmitter (e.g., a user) to an
M-antenna receiver (e.g., a Base Station) occurs through scattering clusters
located in the far field of the receiving antenna array. The Angular Spread
Function (ASF) of the corresponding M-dim channel vector describes the angular
density of the received signal power at the array. The modern literature on
massive MIMO has recognized that the knowledge of covariance matrix of user
channel vectors is very useful for various applications such as hybrid digital
analog beamforming, pilot decontamination, etc. Therefore, most literature has
focused on the estimation of such channel covariance matrices. However, in some
applications such as uplink-downlink covariance transformation (for FDD massive
MIMO precoding) and channel sounding some form of ASF estimation is required
either implicitly or explicitly. It turns out that while covariance estimation
is well-known and well-conditioned, the ASF estimation is a much harder problem
and is in general ill-posed. In this paper, we show that under additional
geometrically-consistent group-sparsity structure on the ASF, which is
prevalent in almost all wireless propagation scenarios, one is able to estimate
ASF properly. We propose sparse dictionary-based algorithms that promote this
group-sparsity structure via suitable regularizations. Since generally it is
difficult to capture the notion of group-sparsity through proper
regularization, we propose another algorithm based on Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) that learns this structure. We provide numerical simulations to assess
the performance of our proposed algorithms. We also compare the results with
that of other methods in the literature, where we re-frame those methods in the

chamber (TPC) has the potential to improve the detector sensitivity for direct
dark matter searches in the future. A major challenge facing TPC detectors in
future dark matter experiments will be the reduction of the internal background
such as $^{222}$Rn and the deterioration of the ionization signal due to
electronegative impurities. The hermetic quartz chamber can isolate the TPC's
sensitive volume from external interference and is thus expected to prevent
contamination caused by the radioactive and electronegative impurities, which
originate from outer detector materials. At the Kamioka Observatory in Japan,
we developed a TPC with a quartz chamber that contains a $\phi 48 \times 58$ mm
volume of liquid xenon. At this development stage, we did not aim at the
perfect hermeticity of the quartz chamber. Our aim here is twofold: first, to
demonstrate via the use of a calibration source that the presence of quartz
materials in the TPC does not impact its operation; and second, to perform
quantitative measurements of the TPC's characteristics. We successfully
measured electron drift velocities of 1.2--1.7 mm/$\mu$s in liquid xenon under
electric fields ranging from 75--384 V/cm, and also observed small S2 signals
produced by a single ionized electron with a light yield of 16.5 $\pm$ 0.5 PE.
These results were consistent with the expected values; therefore, our
demonstrations provide a proof of principle for TPCs incorporating a quartz
chamber.

annular region around an axis. There is however no rotation around the axis and
the approximate axial symmetry with no swirl excludes a real blow-up. We
conclude with a discussion on the possible candidates for a real blow-up.

focus on the launching of wind in the accretion flow scale. It still remains
unclear how far the winds can propagate outward and what is their large-scale
dynamics. As the first paper of this series, we study the large-scale dynamics
of thermal wind beyond accretion scales via analytical and numerical methods.
Boundary conditions, which are crucial to our problem, are analyzed and
presented based on the small-scale simulations combined with observations of
winds. Both black hole and galaxy potential are taken into account. For winds
originated from hot accretion flows, we find that the wind can reach to large
scales. The radial profiles of velocity, density, and temperature can be
approximated by $v_r\approx v_{r0}, \rho\approx \rho_{0}(r/r_0)^{-2}$, and
$T\approx T_0 (r/r_0)^{-2(\gamma-1)}$, where $v_{r0}, \rho_0, T_0$ are the
velocity, density, and temperature of winds at the boundary $r_0(\equiv 10^3
r_g)$, $\gamma$ is the polytropic index. During the outward propagation, the
enthalpy and the rotational energy compensate the increase of gravitational
potential. For thin disks, we find that because the Bernoulli parameter is
smaller, winds cannot propagate as far as the hot winds, but stop at a certain
radius where the Bernoulli parameter is equal to the potential energy. Before
the winds stop, the profiles of dynamical quantities can also be approximated
by the above relations. In this case the rotational energy alone compensates
the increase of the potential energy.

present study, we employed time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering to map
out the low-temperature spectrum of spin excitations in single-crystalline
GdPtBi. The observed spectra reveal two spectrally sharp dispersive spin-wave
modes, which reflects the multi-domain state of the $\mathbf{k} =

$\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}$ from two private matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$

to a design a joint communication-computation procedure that optimally balances
conflicting communication and computation metrics without leaking any
information on both $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ to any set of $\ell\leq N$
servers. To this end, the user applies coding with $\tilde{\mathbf{A}}_i$ and
$\tilde{\mathbf{B}}_i$ representing encoded versions of $\mathbf{A}$ and
$\mathbf{B}$ destined to the $i$-th server. Now, SDMM involves multiple
tradeoffs. One such tradeoff is the tradeoff between uplink (UL) and downlink
(DL) costs. To find a good balance between these two metrics, we propose two
schemes which we term USCSA and GSCSA that are based on secure cross subspace

deployable in these systems. Computation-In-Memory architectures based on
resistive nonvolatile memory (NVM) technologies hold great promise of
satisfying the compute and memory demands of high-performance and low-power,
inherent in modern DNNs. Nevertheless, these technologies are still immature
and suffer from both the intrinsic analog-domain noise problems and the
inability of representing negative weights in the NVM structures, incurring in
larger crossbar sizes with concomitant impact on ADCs and DACs. In this paper,
we provide a training framework for addressing these challenges and
quantitatively evaluate the circuit-level efficiency gains thus accrued. We
make two contributions: Firstly, we propose a training algorithm that
eliminates the need for tuning individual layers of a DNN ensuring uniformity
across layer weights and activations. This ensures analog-blocks that can be
reused and peripheral hardware substantially reduced. Secondly, using NAS
methods, we propose the use of unipolar-weighted (either all-positive or
all-negative weights) matrices/sub-matrices. Weight unipolarity obviates the
need for doubling crossbar area leading to simplified analog periphery. We
validate our methodology with CIFAR10 and HAR applications by mapping to
crossbars using 4-bit and 2-bit devices. We achieve up to 92:91% accuracy (95%
floating-point) using 2-bit only-positive weights for HAR. A combination of the
proposed techniques leads to 80% area improvement and up to 45% energy

first-order stationary points in non-convex environments. In this work, we

further improvement by employing asymmetric combination weights. The results

regime using Hairer's theory of regularity structures. The equation is formally
given by \begin{equation} \label{e}(\partial_t-\Delta)\phi = -\phi^3 + \infty
\phi +\xi, \tag{$\star$} \end{equation} where the term $+\infty \phi$
represents infinite terms that have to be removed in a renormalisation
procedure. We emulate fractional dimensions $d<4$ by adjusting the regularity
of the noise term $\xi$, choosing $\xi \in C^{-3+\delta}$. Our main result
states that if $\phi$ satisfies this equation on a space-time cylinder $P=
(0,1) \times \{ |x| \leq 1 \}$, then away from the boundary $\partial P$ the
solution $\phi$ can be bounded in terms of a finite number of explicit
polynomial expressions in $\xi$, and this bound holds uniformly over all
possible choices of boundary data for $\phi$. The derivation of this bound
makes full use of the super-linear damping effect of the non-linear term
$-\phi^3$. A key part of our analysis consists of an appropriate re-formulation
of the theory of regularity structures in the specific context of \eqref{e},
which allows to couple the small scale control one obtains from this theory
with a suitable large scale argument. Along the way we make several new
observations and simplifications. Instead of a model $(\Pi_x)_x$ and the family
of translation operators $(\Gamma_{x,y})_{x,y}$ we work with just a single
object $(\mathbb{X}_{x, y})$ which acts on itself for translations, very much
in the spirit of Gubinelli's theory of branched rough paths. Furthermore, we
show that in the specific context of \eqref{e} the hierarchy of continuity
conditions which constitute Hairer's definition of a \emph{modelled

an l_0 minimization problem. Since it is an NP-hard problem we have used
approximation methods and sequential convex programming to obtain a suboptimal

material from the cytoplasm, so that their nucleoid is potentially free to
explore the whole volume of the cell. Nonetheless, high resolution images of
bacteria with very compact nucleoids show that such spherical nucleoids are
invariably positioned at the center of mononucleoid cells. The present work
aims to determine whether such preferential localization results from generic
(entropic) interactions between the nucleoid and the cell membrane or instead
requires some specific mechanism, like the tethering of DNA at mid-cell or
periodic fluctuations of the concentration gradient of given chemical species.
To this end, we performed numerical simulations using a coarse-grained model
based on the assumption that the formation of the nucleoid results from a
segregative phase separation mechanism driven by the de-mixing of the DNA and
non-binding globular macromolecules. These simulations show that the abrupt
compaction of the DNA coil, which takes place at large crowder density, close
to the jamming threshold, is accompanied by the re-localization of the DNA coil
close to the regions of the bounding wall with the largest curvature, like the
hemispherical caps of rod-like cells, as if the DNA coil were suddenly
acquiring the localization properties of a solid sphere. This work therefore
supports the hypothesis that the localization of compact nucleoids at regular
cell positions involves either some anchoring of the DNA to the cell membrane
or some dynamical localization mechanism.

kick, the system reaches a stationary, quasi-thermal state even without

Surprisingly, the momentum distribution remains anisotropic at long times,
characterized by different ""temperatures"" along the different directions. In
particular, there is no transfer of the kick energy between the axial and
radial trap directions. To understand these effects we discuss and solve two
closely related models: a spherically symmetric trap $V(r)\simeq r^\alpha$ and
a strongly confined gas along one direction (a ""pancake"" trap). We find that in
the isotropic trap, the gas unexpectedly also preserves the anisotropy of the
kick at long times, which we are able to explain using the conservation of
angular momentum and the virial theorem. Depending on the value of $\alpha$ we
find that the kick can cool or heat the orthogonal directions. The pancake trap
case is quantitatively similar to the quadrupole one. We show that for the
former, the temperature anisotropy and memory of the kick direction are due to
the change in the 2D effective potential resulting from the kick, thereby also
explaining the quadrupole experimental results.

Naturally, such centrality measures have been generalized to groups of
vertices; for popular measures it was shown that the problem of finding the
most central group is $\mathcal{NP}$-hard. As a result, approximation
algorithms to maximize group centralities were introduced recently. Despite a
nearly-linear running time, approximation algorithms for group betweenness and
(to a lesser extent) group closeness are rather slow on large networks due to
high constant overheads.
  That is why we introduce GED-Walk centrality, a new submodular group
centrality measure inspired by Katz centrality. In contrast to closeness and
betweenness, it considers walks of any length rather than shortest paths, with
shorter walks having a higher contribution. We define algorithms that (i)
efficiently approximate the GED-Walk score of a given group and (ii)
efficiently approximate the (proved to be $\mathcal{NP}$-hard) problem of
finding a group with highest GED-Walk score.
  Experiments on several real-world datasets show that scores obtained by
GED-Walk improve performance on common graph mining tasks such as collective
classification and graph-level classification. An evaluation of empirical
running times demonstrates that maximizing GED-Walk (in approximation) is two
orders of magnitude faster compared to group betweenness approximation and for
group sizes $\leq 100$ one to two orders faster than group closeness
approximation. For graphs with tens of millions of edges, approximate GED-Walk
maximization typically needs less than one minute. Furthermore, our experiments
suggest that the maximization algorithms scale linearly with the size of the
input graph and the size of the group.

translation (NMT) models with extremely sparse vocabularies where atomic
treatment of surface forms is unrealistic. This problem is typically addressed
by either pre-processing words into subword units or performing translation
directly at the level of characters. The former is based on word segmentation
algorithms optimized using corpus-level statistics with no regard to the
translation task. The latter learns directly from translation data but requires
rather deep architectures. In this paper, we propose to translate words by
modeling word formation through a hierarchical latent variable model which
mimics the process of morphological inflection. Our model generates words one
character at a time by composing two latent representations: a continuous one,
aimed at capturing the lexical semantics, and a set of (approximately) discrete
features, aimed at capturing the morphosyntactic function, which are shared
among different surface forms. Our model achieves better accuracy in
translation into three morphologically-rich languages than conventional
open-vocabulary NMT methods, while also demonstrating a better generalization
capacity under low to mid-resource settings.

the development of automation of results from GPIO interfaces, which helped
eliminate human error and get more accurate metrics. Measurement automation was
developed using Python 3.7 programming language. Using the INA219 library we
were able to obtain current and voltage indicators from the ina219 board. To
get temperature indicators sufficiently built into Python libraries to read
temperature files in Raspbian. The article focuses on the synchronicity of
measurement results records for more accurate analysis. Therefore, an FTP
client was developed that measures the download speed of the file from the FTP
server and records the results simultaneously with temperature, current and
voltage measurements. To this end, attention is drawn to the multithreading in
Python programming language and the transmission of commands using TCP sockets
in that language. As a result, the dependence of the measured factors was
calculated using the Pearson correlation formula. These measurement factors
affect the autonomy and energy consumption, which is very important for IoT

transport of particles under electric field and solute concentration gradients.
Such interfacial transport phenomena take their origin in a diffuse layer close
to the particle surface, and the motion of the particle is force-free. In the
case of electrophoresis, it is further expected that the stress acting on the
moving particle vanishes locally as a consequence of local electroneutrality.
But the argument does not apply to diffusiophoresis, which takes its origin in
solute concentration gradients. In this paper we investigate further the local
and global force balance on a particle undergoing diffusiophoresis. We
calculate the local tension applied on the particle surface and show that,
counter-intuitively, the local force on the particle does not vanish for
diffusiophoresis, in spite of the global force being zero as expected.
Incidentally, our description allows to clarify the osmotic balance in
diffusiophoresis, which has been a source of debates in the recent years. We
explore various cases, including hard and soft interactions, as well as porous
particles, and provide analytic predictions for the local force balance in
these various systems. The existence of local stresses may induce deformation
of soft particles undergoing diffusiophoresis, hence suggesting applications in
terms of particle separation based on capillary diffusiophoresis.

interested in selecting one among a finite number of hypotheses. We focus on
weakly-connected graphs where the network is partitioned into a sending part
and a receiving part. The data collected by the agents might be heterogeneous.
For example, some sub-networks might intentionally generate data from a fake
hypothesis in order to influence other agents. The social learning task is
accomplished via a diffusion strategy where each agent: i) updates individually
its belief using its private data; ii) computes a new belief by exponentiating
a linear combination of the log-beliefs of its neighbors. First, we examine
what agents learn over weak graphs (social learning problem). We obtain
analytical formulas for the beliefs at the different agents, which reveal how
the agents' detection capability and the network topology interact to influence
the beliefs. In particular, the formulas allow us to predict when a
leader-follower behavior is possible, where some sending agents can control the
mind of the receiving agents by forcing them to choose a particular hypothesis.
Second, we consider the dual or reverse learning problem that reveals how
agents learned: given a stream of beliefs collected at a receiving agent, we
would like to discover the global influence that any sending component exerts
on this receiving agent (topology learning problem). A remarkable and perhaps
unexpected interplay between social and topology learning is observed: given
$H$ hypotheses and $S$ sending components, topology learning can be feasible
when $H\geq S$. The latter being only a necessary condition, we examine the
feasibility of topology learning for two useful classes of problems. The
analysis reveals that a critical element to enable faithful topology learning
is the diversity in the statistical models of the sending sub-networks.

approach to account for hidden physics in reduced order modeling (ROM) of
parameterized systems relevant to fluid dynamics. The hybrid ROM framework is
based on using the first principles to model the known physics in conjunction
with utilizing the data-driven machine learning tools to model remaining
residual that is hidden in data. This framework employs proper orthogonal
decomposition as a compression tool to construct orthonormal bases and Galerkin
projection (GP) as a model to built the dynamical core of the system. Our
proposed methodology hence compensates structural or epistemic uncertainties in
models and utilizes the observed data snapshots to compute true modal
coefficients spanned by these bases. The GP model is then corrected at every
time step with a data-driven rectification using a long short-term memory
(LSTM) neural network architecture to incorporate hidden physics. A
Grassmannian manifold approach is also adapted for interpolating basis
functions to unseen parametric conditions. The control parameter governing the
system's behavior is thus implicitly considered through true modal coefficients
as input features to the LSTM network. The effectiveness of the HAM approach is
discussed through illustrative examples that are generated synthetically to
take hidden physics into account. Our approach thus provides insights
addressing a fundamental limitation of the physics-based models when the
governing equations are incomplete to represent underlying physical processes.

  Magnetic Field",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The spontaneous motion of liquid droplets on solid surfaces is the result of
an unbalanced surface tension force, which is sometimes called the ""Marangoni
effect"". This can be triggered by either a difference in surface temperature or
a heterogeneity in the topography or chemistry of the surface passively or
actively. The imbibition of liquid within capillary tubes, horizontal ice
wicking on either hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrates, and inkjet printing
for example are just some classic illustrations of where the Lucas-Washburn
equation can predict droplet behavior characteristics fairly well. In contrast,
this study reveals an example of droplet behavior not previously studied that
is not well-predicted by the Lucas-Washburn equation, namely the motion of
ferrofluid droplets in the presence of uniform magnetic field. When a
ferrofluid droplet is horizontally exposed to an external uniform magnetic
field on a biphilic surface tension gradient in the shape of a wedge, it
appears to violates the Lucas-Washburn equation which predicts that droplet
travel distance should scale with the square root of time (i.e. l~t^(1/2)).
Rather, our experimental results suggest that the movement of the ferrofluid
droplet is slower following the relationship, (l~t^(1/3)). Furthermore, due to
the relatively high viscosity of water-based ferrofluid droplets, we observed
that at the beginning of the motion, the visco-capillary effect dominates the
effects of the magnetism, and the droplets tend to follow the well-known
relationship, (l~t^(1/10)). This initial stage of droplet spreading is known as
""Tanner's Law"".

from the recently introduced Particles on Demand (PoD) method, the method
operates in a static, non-moving reference frame. Yet the SLLBM in the present

invariance. The SLLBM solver allows for an independent time step size due to
the integration along characteristics and for the use of unusual velocity sets,
like the D2Q25, which is constructed by the roots of the fifth-order Hermite
polynomial. The properties of the present model are shown in diverse example
simulations of a two-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex, a Sod shock tube, a

like a bad idea for three main reasons: First, a NN LF will likely have less

there is no generalization across LFs, but across view and time instead.
Consequently, a network needs to be trained for each LF video. Surprisingly,
these problems can turn into substantial advantages: Other than the linear
pixel basis, a NN has to come up with a compact, non-linear i.e., more
intelligent, explanation of color, conditioned on the sparse view and time
coordinates. As observed for many NN however, this representation now is
interpolatable: if the image output for sparse view coordinates is plausible,
it is for all intermediate, continuous coordinates as well. Our specific

based on the minimal nearest-neighbor $J$-$K$-$\Gamma$ model and builds on the
idea that the incommensurate counter-rotating order observed experimentally at
zero field can be treated as a long-distance twisting of a nearby commensurate
order with six spin sublattices. The results reveal that the behavior of the
system for ${\bf H}\parallel{\bf a}$, ${\bf H}\parallel{\bf b}$ and ${\bf
H}\parallel{\bf c}$ share a number of qualitative features, including: i) a
strong intertwining of the modulated, counter-rotating order with a set of
uniform orders; ii) the disappearance of the modulated order at a critical
field $H^\ast$, whose value is strongly anisotropic with $H_{\bf
b}^\ast\!<\!H_{\bf c}^\ast\!\ll\!H_{\bf a}^\ast$; iii) the presence of a robust
zigzag phase above $H^\ast$; and iv) the fulfillment of the Bragg peak
intensity sum rule. It is noteworthy that the disappearance of the modulated
order for ${\bf H}\parallel{\bf c}$ proceeds via a `metamagnetic' first-order
transition which does not restore all broken symmetries. This implies the
existence of a second finite-$T$ phase transition at higher magnetic fields. We
also demonstrate that quantum fluctuations give rise to a significant reduction
of the local moments for all directions of the field. The results for the total
magnetization for ${\bf H}\parallel{\bf b}$ are consistent with available data
and confirm a previous assertion that the system is very close to the
highly-frustrated $K$-$\Gamma$ line in parameter space. Our predictions for the
magnetic response for fields along ${\bf a}$ and ${\bf c}$ await experimental
verification.

As is known, this picture is unconceivable in quantum physics due to vacuum
fluctuations. The fundamental difference between the two frameworks is that
classical physics is commutative (simultaneous observables) while quantum
physics is intrinsically noncommutative (Heisenberg uncertainty relations). In
this sense, we may say that time is generated by noncommutativity; if this
statement is correct, we should be able to derive time out of a noncommutative
space.
  We know that a von Neumann algebra is a noncommutative space. About 50 years
ago the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory revealed an intrinsic evolution
associated with any given (faithful, normal) state of a von Neumann algebra, so
a noncommutative space is intrinsically dynamical. This evolution is
characterised by the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger thermal equilibrium condition in
quantum statistical mechanics (Haag, Hugenholtz, Winnink), thus modular time is
related to temperature. Indeed, positivity of temperature fixes a
quantum-thermodynamical arrow of time.
  We shall sketch some aspects of our recent work extending the modular
evolution to a quantum operation (completely positive map) level and how this
gives a mathematically rigorous understanding of entropy bounds in physics and
information theory. A key point is the relation with Jones' index of
subfactors.
  In the last part, we outline further recent entropy computations in
relativistic quantum field theory models by operator algebraic methods, that
can be read also within classical information theory. The information contained

subspaces and related to the quantum null energy inequality.

that private information of the players cannot be reconstructed even if all the

artificial-and-spiking neuronal activations to improve the learning ability of
the training methodologies to yield competitive accuracy, while, yielding large

  scattering in layered media","41 pages, 5 figures",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a novel method to establish the wellposedness and
convergence theory of the uniaxial-perfectly-matched-layer (UPML) method in
solving a two-dimensional acoustic scattering problem due to a compactly
supported source, where the medium consists of two layers separated by the
horizontal axis. When perfectly matched layer (PML) is used to truncate the
vertical variable only, the medium structure becomes a closed waveguide. The
Green function due to a primary source point in this waveguide can be
constructed explicitly based on variable separations and Fourier
transformations. In the horizontal direction, by properly placing periodical
PMLs and locating periodic source points imaged by the primary source point,
the exciting waveguide Green functions by those imaging points can be assembled
to construct the Green function due to the primary source point for the
two-layer medium truncated by a UPML. Incorporated with Green's identities,
this UPML Green function directly leads to the wellposedness of the acoustic
scattering problem in a UPML truncation with no constraints about wavenumbers
or UPML absorbing strength. Consequently, we firstly prove that such a UPML
truncating problem is unconditionally resonance free. Moreover, we show, under
quite general conditions, that this UPML Green function converges to the exact
layered Green function exponentially fast as absorbing strength of the UPML
increases, which in turn gives rise to the exponential convergence of the
solution of the UPML problem towards the original solution.

enhancement mechanisms in the particle production. On the one hand, as it has
been already discussed in previous works, it induces tachyonic instabilities in
the field which are the dominant enhancement mechanism for light masses. On the
other hand, we have found that it also provokes a resonant effect in the
ultraviolet region of the spectrum which becomes dominant for masses in the
range $10^9\,{\rm GeV}$ to $10^{13}\,{\rm GeV}$. We have developed an
analytical approximation to describe this resonance effect and its consequences
on the ultraviolet regime. Once we have calculated the theoretical
gravitational production, we constrain the possible values of the
phenomenological field parameters to be considered as a dark matter candidate.
We do so by comparing the theoretically predicted abundance with the observed
one and ensuring that the theoretical prediction does not lead to

for histogram and synthetic data publishing. Our contribution is two-fold: 1)
we identify trends and connections in the contributions to the field of
differential privacy for histograms and synthetic data and 2) we provide an
understanding of the privacy/accuracy trade off challenge by crystallizing
different dimensions to accuracy improvement. Accordingly, we position and
visualize the ideas in relation to each other and external work, and
deconstruct each algorithm to examine the building blocks separately with the
aim of pinpointing which dimension of accuracy improvement each
technique/approach is targeting. Hence, this systematization of knowledge (SoK)
provides an understanding of in which dimensions and how accuracy improvement
can be pursued without sacrificing privacy.

ponderomotive electron-laser interactions at relativistic velocities are
important for emerging technologies from laser-based particle accelerators to
laser-enhanced electron microscopy, the effects of special relativity on the
interaction have only been studied theoretically. Here, we use a transmission
electron microscope to measure the position-dependent phase shift imparted to a
relativistic electron wave function when it traverses a standing laser wave.
The kinetic energy of the electrons is varied between $80\,\mathrm{keV}$ and
$300\,\mathrm{keV}$, and the laser standing wave has a continuous-wave
intensity of $175\,\mathrm{GW/cm}^2$. In contrast to the non-relativistic case,
we demonstrate that the phase shift depends on both the electron velocity and
the wave polarization, confirming the predictions of a quasiclassical theory of
the interaction. Remarkably, if the electron's speed is greater than
$1/\sqrt{2}$ of the speed of light, the phase shift at the electric field nodes
of the wave can exceed that at the antinodes. In this case there exists a
polarization such that the phase shifts at the nodes and antinodes are equal,
and the electron does not experience Kapitza-Dirac diffraction. Our results
thus provide new capabilities for coherent electron beam manipulation.

for a given power network is equivalent to depicting a high-dimensional mapping
from the load inputs to the generation and phase angle outputs. We first train
a DNN to learn the mapping and predict the generations from the load inputs. We
then directly reconstruct the phase angles from the generations and loads by
using the power flow equations. Such a predict-and-reconstruct approach reduces
the dimension of the mapping to learn, subsequently cutting down the size of
the DNN and the amount of training data needed. We further derive a condition
for tuning the size of the DNN according to the desired approximation accuracy
of the load-generation mapping. We develop a post-processing procedure based on
$\ell_1$-projection to ensure the feasibility of the obtained solution, which
can be of independent interest. Simulation results for IEEE test cases show
that DeepOPF generates feasible solutions with less than 0.2% optimality loss,
while speeding up the computation time by up to two orders of magnitude as

$O(1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2})$ combinatorial complexity, which is optimal in the
worst case.
  Our result is based on a new relationship between $\varepsilon$-width caps of
a convex body and its polar body. Using this relationship, we are able to
obtain a volume-sensitive bound on the number of approximating caps that are
""essentially different."" We achieve our main result by combining this with a

better average accuracy than the baseline Energy Star models. The third order
MLRi and GBT models achieve 4.9% and 24.9% increase in adjusted R2,

The contraction and relaxation of left ventricle (LV) is the main driving force

the initiation and progression of many CVDs. Thus, understanding and evaluating
the flow pattern inside a patient LV is thought to be essential to capture, and
subsequently treat, cardiovascular dysfunction at early stages to reduce the
mortality and morbidity rates. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, often
derived from patient-specific medical imaging, have been used to provide a more
fundamental understanding of individual LV flow patterns and pressure fields.
Such image-based modeling may advance diagnostic capabilities, treatment
protocols and help guide clinicians to choose the most effective therapy of
CVDs. Most prior ventricular flow studies obtained LV wall geometries from in
vivo ultrasound-based or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images with
limited resolution. The model geometries were often highly simplified and
usually lacked the papillary muscles (PM) and the corrugated trabecular
structures of the LV. Since the LV flow pattern is sensitive to geometry, it is
important to understand the effect of this simplification on modeling
intraventricular flow and pressure. Here we apply CFD modeling to a
subject-specific porcine LV model with detailed ventricular structures and
motion obtained from previous solid mechanics finite-element (FE) simulations
based on high-resolution image data. We simplified the detailed LV endocardial
surfaces to remove PM and trabecular structures and built a smoothed model that
resembles the resolution of in vivo MRI images. We then compare the simulated

successful in phase retrieval, where signals are reconstructed from magnitude
constraints and general characteristics (sparsity, support, etc.). Instead of
taking gradient steps, the optimizer in the constraint based approach, called
relaxed-reflect-reflect (RRR), derives its steps from projections to local
constraints. In neural networks one such projection makes the minimal
modification to the inputs $x$, the associated weights $w$, and the
pre-activation value $y$ at each neuron, to satisfy the equation $x\cdot w=y$.
These projections, along with a host of other local projections (constraining
pre- and post-activations, etc.) can be partitioned into two sets such that all
the projections in each set can be applied concurrently, across the network and
across all data in the training batch. This partitioning into two sets is
analogous to the situation in phase retrieval and the setting for which the
general purpose RRR optimizer was designed. Owing to the novelty of the method,
this paper also serves as a self-contained tutorial. Starting with a
single-layer network that performs non-negative matrix factorization, and
concluding with a generative model comprising an autoencoder and classifier,
all applications and their implementations by projections are described in

mFAE comprises a frame tokenizer and an utterance embedder. The frame tokenizer
models linguistic content of input speech with a discrete categorical
distribution. It performs frame clustering by assigning each frame a soft
mixture label. The utterance embedder generates an utterance-level vector
representation. A frame decoder serves to reconstruct speech features from the
encoders'outputs. The mFAE is evaluated on speaker verification (SV) task and
unsupervised subword modeling (USM) task. The SV experiments on VoxCeleb 1 show
that the utterance embedder is capable of extracting speaker-discriminative

heterogeneous agents. One strategy promotes global smoothing over the graph and
a second strategy promotes local smoothing over neighbourhoods. It is assumed
that the feature sizes can vary from one agent to another, with some agents
observing insufficient attributes to be able to make reliable decisions on
their own. As a result, cooperation with neighbours is necessary. However, due
to the fact that the feature dimensions are different across the agents, their
classifier dimensions will also be different. This means that cooperation
cannot rely on combining the classifier parameters. We instead propose
smoothing the outputs of the classifiers, which are the predicted labels. By
doing so, the dynamics that describes the evolution of the network classifier
becomes more challenging than usual because the classifier parameters end up
appearing as part of the regularization term as well. We illustrate performance
by means of computer simulations.

ion transport, but also a promising material for desalination or osmotic power
generation. Understanding the physics underlying ion transport through
nano-sized pores allows better design of porous membrane materials. Material
surfaces can present hydrophobicity, a property which can make them prone to
formation of surface nanobubbles. Nanobubbles can influence the electrical
transport properties of such devices. We demonstrate an approach which uses
hydraulic pressure to probe the electrical transport properties of solid state
nanopores. We show how pressure can be used to wet pores, and how it allows
control over bubbles in the nanometer scale range normally unachievable using
only an electrical driving force. Molybdenum disulfide is then used as a
typical example of a 2D material on which we demonstrate wetting and bubble
induced nonlinear and linear conductance in the regimes typically used with
these experiments. We show that by using pressure one can identify and evade
wetting artifacts.

  orbital occupation numbers. A critique of Janak's theorem","20 pages, 2 figures","Molecular Physics, published on-line May 27, 2019","10.1080/00268976.2019.1612955",,"physics.chem-ph cond-mat.other physics.atm-clus quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The relation between the derivative of the energy with respect to occupation
number and the orbital energy, $\partial E/\partial n_i = \epsilon_i$, was
first introduced by Slater for approximate total energy expressions such as
Hartree-Fock and exchange-only LDA, and his derivation holds for hybrid
functionals as well. We argue that Janak's extension of this relation to
(exact) Kohn-Sham density functional theory is not valid. The reason is the
nonexistence of systems with noninteger electron number, and therefore of the
derivative of the total energy with respect to electron number, $\partial
E/\partial N$. How to handle the lack of a defined derivative $\partial
E/\partial N$ at the integer point, is demonstrated using the Lagrange
multiplier technique to enforce constraints. The well-known straight-line
behavior of the energy as derived from statistical physical considerations
[J.P. Perdew, R. G. Parr, M. Levy and J.J. Balduz, Phys. Rev. Lett. 49, 1691
(1982)] for the average energy of a molecule in a macroscopic sample (""dilute
gas"") as a function of average electron number is not a property of a single
molecule at $T=0$. One may choose to represent the energy of a molecule in the
nonphysical domain of noninteger densities by a straight-line functional, but
the arbitrariness of this choice precludes the drawing of physical conclusions
from it.

low-resolution image to a high resolution image. This inherently has
applications in remote sensing as a way to increase the spatial resolution in
satellite imagery. This suggests a possible improvement to automated target
recognition in image classification and object detection. We explore the effect
that different training sets have on SISR with the network, Super Resolution
Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN). We train 5 SRGANs on different land-use
classes (e.g. agriculture, cities, ports) and test them on the same unseen
dataset. We attempt to find the qualitative and quantitative differences in
SISR, binary classification, and object detection performance. We find that
curated training sets that contain objects in the test ontology perform better
on both computer vision tasks while having a complex distribution of images
allows object detection models to perform better. However, Super Resolution
(SR) might not be beneficial to certain problems and will see a diminishing
amount of returns for datasets that are closer to being solved.

people may not get expected exercise results without following professional
guidance while hiring personal trainers is expensive. In this paper, an
effective real-time system called Fitness Done Right (FDR) is proposed for
helping people exercise correctly on their own. The system includes detecting
human body parts, recognizing exercise pose and detecting errors for test poses
as well as giving correction advice. Generally, two branch multi-stage CNN is
used for training data sets in order to learn human body parts and
associations. Then, considering two poses, which are plank and squat in our
model, we design a detection algorithm, combining Euclidean and angle
distances, to determine the pose in the image. Finally, key values for key
features of the two poses are computed correspondingly in the pose error
detection part, which helps give correction advice. We conduct our system in
real-time situation with error rate down to $1.2\%$, and the screenshots of
experimental results are also presented.

  earlier manuscript titled ""Dynamically Protecting Privacy, under Uncertainty""",,,,"cs.GT math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose and analyze a recipient-anonymous stochastic routing model to
study a fundamental trade-off between anonymity and routing delay. An agent
wants to quickly reach a goal vertex in a network through a sequence of routing
actions, while an overseeing adversary observes the agent's entire trajectory
and tries to identify her goal among those vertices traversed. We are
interested in understanding the probability that the adversary can correctly
identify the agent's goal (anonymity), as a function of the time it takes the
agent to reach it (delay). A key feature of our model is the presence of
intrinsic uncertainty in the environment, so that each of the agent's intended
steps is subject to random perturbation and thus may not materialize as
planned. Using large-network asymptotics, our main results provide near-optimal
characterization of the anonymity-delay trade-off under a number of network
topologies. Our main technical contributions are centered around a new class of
""noise-harnessing"" routing strategies that adaptively combine intrinsic
uncertainty from the environment with additional artificial randomization to
achieve provably efficient obfuscation.
