eliminating gerrymandering has enormous implications to sustain the backbone of
democratic principles of a society. Although there is no dearth of legal briefs
involving gerrymandering over many years, it is only more recently that
mathematicians and applied computational researchers have started to
investigate this topic. However, it has received relatively little attention so
far from the computational complexity researchers dealing with theoretical
analysis of computational complexity issues, such as computational hardness,
approximability issues, etc. There could be many reasons for this, such as
descriptions of these problem non-CS non-math (often legal or political)
journals that theoretical CS (TCS) people usually do not follow, or the lack of
coverage of these topics in TCS publication venues. One of our modest goals in
writing this article is to improve upon this situation by stimulating further
interactions between the gerrymandering and TCS researchers. To this effect,
our main contributions are twofold: (1) we provide formalization of several
models, related concepts, and corresponding problem statements using TCS
frameworks from the descriptions of these problems as available in existing
non-TCS (perhaps legal) venues, and (2) we also provide computational
complexity analysis of some versions of these problems, leaving other versions

gerrymandering, but to introduce a series of concepts, models and problems to

mathematical approach to these systems through classic bioeconomic models.
Decimated populations did not recover as fast as predicted by these models and
depensatory effects were introduced to better fit the dynamics at low
population abundances. Alternative to depensation, modeling captures by
non-linear harvesting functions produces equivalent outcomes at small
abundances, and the dynamics undergoes a bifurcation leading to population
collapse and recovery once catching efforts are above or below certain
thresholds, respectively. The time that a population takes to undergo these
transitions has been mostly overlooked in bioeconomic contexts, though. In this
work we quantify analytically and numerically the times associated to these
collapse and recovery transitions in a model incorporating non-linear
harvesting and immigration in the presence and absence of demographic
stochasticity. Counterintuitively, although species at low abundances are prone
to extinction due to demographic stochasticity, our results show that
stochastic collapse and recovery times are upper bounded by their deterministic
estimates. This occurs over the full range of immigration rates. Our work may
have relevant quantitative implications in the context of fishery management
and rebuilding.

recent phase curves have shown deviations from the trends that emerge from this

Jupiter energy budgets. One such process, molecular hydrogen dissociation and
recombination, can enhance energy redistribution on ultra-hot Jupiters with
temperatures above $\sim2000$ K. In order to study the impact of H$_{2}$
dissociation on ultra-hot Jupiters, we present a phase curve of KELT-9b
observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope at 4.5 $\mu$m. KELT-9b is the hottest
known transiting planet, with a 4.5-$\mu$m dayside brightness temperature of
$4566^{+140}_{-136}$ K and a nightside temperature of $2556^{+101}_{-97}$ K. We
observe a phase curve amplitude of $0.609 \pm 0.020$ and a hot spot offset of
$18.7^{+2.1}_{-2.3}$ degrees. The observed amplitude is too small to be
explained by a simple balance between radiation and advection. General
circulation models (GCMs) and an energy balance model that include the effects
of H$_{2}$ dissociation and recombination provide a better match to the data.
The GCMs, however, predict a maximum hot spot offset of $5$ degrees, which
disagrees with our observations at $>5\sigma$ confidence. This discrepancy may
be due to magnetic effects in the planet's highly ionized atmosphere.

wireless communication capacity both cost-effectively and energy-efficiently,
by properly altering the signal propagation via tuning a large number of
passive reflecting units. In this paper, we aim to characterize the fundamental
capacity limit of IRS-aided point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) communication systems with multi-antenna transmitter and receiver in
general, by jointly optimizing the IRS reflection coefficients and the MIMO
transmit covariance matrix. First, we consider narrowband transmission under
frequency-flat fading channels, and develop an efficient alternating
optimization algorithm to find a locally optimal solution by iteratively
optimizing the transmit covariance matrix or one of the reflection coefficients
with the others being fixed. Next, we consider capacity maximization for
broadband transmission in a general MIMO orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) system under frequency-selective fading channels, where
transmit covariance matrices can be optimized for different subcarriers while
only one common set of IRS reflection coefficients can be designed to cater to
all subcarriers. To tackle this more challenging problem, we propose a new
alternating optimization algorithm based on convex relaxation to find a
high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results show that our proposed
algorithms achieve substantially increased capacity compared to traditional
MIMO channels without the IRS, and also outperform various benchmark schemes.
In particular, it is shown that with the proposed algorithms, various key
parameters of the IRS-aided MIMO channel such as channel total power, rank, and
condition number can be significantly improved for capacity enhancement.

  Process Learning",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While most power system small-signal stability assessments rely on the
reduced Jacobian, which depends non-linearly on the states, uncertain operating
points introduce nontrivial hurdles in certifying the system's stability. In
this paper, a novel probabilistic robust small-signal stability (PRS) framework
is developed for a power system based on Gaussian process (GP) learning. The
proposed PRS assessment provides a robust stability certificate for a state
subspace, such as that specified by the error bounds of the state estimation,
with a given probability. With such a PRS certificate, all inner points of the
concerned subspace will be stable with at least the corresponding confidence
level. To this end, the behavior of the critical eigenvalue of the reduced
Jacobian with state points in a state subspace is learned using GP. The
proposed PRS certificate along with the Subspace-based Search and
Confidence-based Search mechanisms constitute a holistic framework catering to
all scenarios. The proposed framework is a powerful approach to assess the
stability under uncertainty because it does not require input uncertainty
distributions and other state-specific input-to-output approximations. Further,
the critical eigenvalue behavior in a state subspace is analyzed using an upper
bound of the eigenvalue variations and their inferences are discussed in
detail. The results on three-machine nine-bus WSCC system show that the
proposed certificate can find the robust stable state subspace with a given
probability.

Networks (GNNs) aggregates the feature vector of each node with the feature
vectors of its neighboring nodes. The GNN is not aware of the locations of the
nodes in the global structure of the graph and when the local structures
corresponding to different nodes are similar to each other, the convolution
layer maps all those nodes to similar or same feature vectors in the continuous
feature space. Therefore, the GNN cannot distinguish two graphs if their
difference is not in their local structures. In addition, when the nodes are
not labeled/attributed the convolution layers can fail to distinguish even
different local structures. In this paper, we propose an effective solution to
address this problem of the GNNs. The proposed approach leverages a spatial
representation of the graph which makes the neural network aware of the
differences between the nodes and also their locations in the graph. The
spatial representation which is equivalent to a point-cloud representation of
the graph is obtained by a graph embedding method. Using the proposed approach,
the local feature extractor of the GNN distinguishes similar local structures
in different locations of the graph and the GNN infers the topological
structure of the graph from the spatial distribution of the locally extracted
feature vectors. Moreover, the spatial representation is utilized to simplify
the graph down-sampling problem. A new graph pooling method is proposed and it
is shown that the proposed pooling method achieves competitive or better
results in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.

approximately resolved with mesh-free deep neural networks to parametrize the
solution space. In the second phase, a solution ansatz of the finite element
method to solve the given PDE is obtained from the approximate solution in the
first phase, and the ansatz can serve as a good initial guess such that
Newton's method for solving the nonlinear PDE is able to converge to the ground
truth solution with high-accuracy quickly. Systematic theoretical analysis is
provided to justify the Int-Deep framework for several classes of problems.
Numerical results show that the Int-Deep outperforms existing purely deep

observations from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The
measured secondary eclipse depth and peak-to-peak atmospheric brightness
modulation are $650^{+14}_{-15}$ ppm and $566\pm16$ ppm, respectively. The
planet's brightness variation reaches maximum $31\pm5$ minutes before the
midpoint of the secondary eclipse, indicating a
$5\overset{\circ}{.}2\pm0\overset{\circ}{.}9$ eastward shift in the dayside hot
spot from the substellar point. We also detect stellar pulsations on KELT-9
with a period of $7.58695\pm0.00091$ hours. The dayside emission of KELT-9b in
the TESS bandpass is consistent with a blackbody brightness temperature of
$4600\pm100$ K. The corresponding nightside brightness temperature is
$3040\pm100$ K, comparable to the dayside temperatures of the hottest known
exoplanets. In addition, we detect a significant phase-curve signal at the
first harmonic of the orbital frequency and a marginal signal at the second
harmonic. While the amplitude of the first harmonic component is consistent
with the predicted ellipsoidal distortion modulation assuming equilibrium
tides, the phase of this photometric variation is shifted relative to the
expectation. Placing KELT-9b in the context of other exoplanets with
phase-curve observations, we find that the elevated nightside temperature and
relatively low day-night temperature contrast agree with the predictions of
atmospheric models that include H$_{2}$ dissociation and recombination. The
nightside temperature of KELT-9b implies an atmospheric composition containing
about 50% molecular and 50% atomic hydrogen at 0.1 bar, a nightside emission
spectrum that deviates significantly from a blackbody, and a 0.5-2.0 $\mu$m
transmission spectrum that is featureless at low resolution.

future cosmological analyses. We first investigate the questions of stability
and applicability of some moment-based inconsistency measures to multiple data
sets. We show that the recently introduced index of inconsistency (IOI) is
numerically stable while it can be applied to multiple data sets. We use an
illustrative construction of constraints as well as an example with real data
sets (i.e. WMAP versus Planck) to show some limitations of the application of
the Karhunen-Loeve decomposition to discordance measures. Second, we perform
various consistency analyzes using IOI between multiple current data sets while
\textit{working with the entire common parameter spaces}. We find current
Large-Scale-Structure (LSS) data sets (Planck CMB lensing, DES
lensing-clustering and SDSS RSD) all to be consistent with one another. This is
found to be not the case for Planck temperature (TT) versus polarization
(TE,EE) data, where moderate inconsistencies are present. Noteworthy, we find a
strong inconsistency between joint LSS probes and Planck with IOI=5.27, and a
moderate tension between DES and Planck with IOI=3.14. Next, using the IOI
metric, we compare the Hubble constant from five independent probes. We confirm
previous strong tensions between local measurement (SH0ES) and Planck as well
as between H0LiCOW and Planck, but also find new strong tensions between SH0ES
measurement and the joint LSS probes with IOI=6.73 (i.e. 3.7-$\sigma$ in 1D) as
well as between joint LSS and combined probes SH0ES+H0LiCOW with IOI=8.59 (i.e.
4.1-$\sigma$ in 1D). Whether due to systematic effects in the data sets or
problems with the underlying model, sources of these old and new tensions need
to be identified and dealt with.

demonstrate that for bands with small fillings, such interaction is typically
ferromagnetic and short-range. The nearest-layer interaction is proportional to
the ratio of the interlayer hopping and in-plane band width squared. On the
other hand, the superconducting contribution always gives antiferromagnetic
interaction and may extend over several layers when the interlayer hopping
energy exceeds the superconducting gap. The frustration caused by the interplay
between the normal and superconducting parts may lead to spiral ground-state
magnetic configuration. The four-fold in-plane anisotropy may lock the rotation
angle between the moments in the neighboring layers to $90^\circ$, as it was
observed in RbEuFe$_{4}$As$_{4}$

generation and transmission expansion planning approaches are first described.
Then, the hierarchical approach is described in detail. In general terms, in
this scheme the investment decisions are made in steps, instead of an overall
optimization scheme. This paper proposes a stochastic hierarchical
generation-transmission expansion planning methodology based on a three-step
procedure, as follows:
  1. In this step, an integrated expansion planning problem of generation and
interregional interconnections is solved; 2. Taking the optimal expansion plan
of (generation and interconnections) into account, a production costing
simulation with the detailed network representation is performed without
monitoring circuit flow limits (except the ones in the interconnections, which
are monitored); this simulation produces a set of optimal dispatch scenarios
(vectors of bus loads and generation); 3. A Transmission Expansion Planning
(TEP) model is then applied to determine the least-cost transmission expansion
plan that is robust with respect to all operation scenarios of step 2, using an
enhanced Benders decomposition scheme that: (a) incorporates a subset of the
operation scenarios in the investment module; and (b) presents a ""warm-up"" step
with a ""greedy"" algorithm that produces a (good) feasible solution and an
initial set of feasibility cuts.
  The application of the hierarchical planning scheme is illustrated with a
realistic multi-country generation and transmission planning case study of the
Central America's electricity market.

models exhibiting a wide range of activity patterns while remaining

has been challenging to fit such mechanistic spiking networks at the single

such data at a meso scale, using a mechanistic but low-dimensional and hence
statistically tractable model. The mesoscopic representation is obtained by
approximating a population of neurons as multiple homogeneous `pools' of
neurons, and modelling the dynamics of the aggregate population activity within
each pool. We derive the likelihood of both single-neuron and connectivity
parameters given this activity, which can then be used to either optimize
parameters by gradient ascent on the log-likelihood, or to perform Bayesian
inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. We illustrate this
approach using a model of generalized integrate-and-fire neurons for which
mesoscopic dynamics have been previously derived, and show that both
single-neuron and connectivity parameters can be recovered from simulated data.
In particular, our inference method extracts posterior correlations between
model parameters, which define parameter subsets able to reproduce the data. We
compute the Bayesian posterior for combinations of parameters using MCMC
sampling and investigate how the approximations inherent to a mesoscopic
population model impact the accuracy of the inferred single-neuron parameters.

prove concrete generalization and expressivity results on these randomized

functions) that match the NTK and can in addition be better by a dimension
factor when mild distributional assumptions are present. We demonstrate that
our randomization technique can be generalized systematically beyond the

of $2500~\mathrm{K}$ have found evidence for new physical processes at play in
their atmospheres. In this work, we investigate the effects of the dissociation
of molecular hydrogen and recombination of atomic hydrogen on the atmospheric
circulation of ultra-hot Jupiters. To do so, we incorporate these effects into
a general circulation model (GCM) for hot Jupiter atmospheres, and run a large
suite of models varying the incident stellar flux, rotation period, and
strength of frictional drag. We find that including hydrogen dissociation and
recombination reduces the fractional day-to-night temperature contrast of
ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres and causes the speed of the equatorial jet to
decrease in simulations with fixed rotation. This is because the large energy
input required for hydrogen dissociation cools the dayside of the planet, and
the energy released due to hydrogen recombination warms the nightside. The
resulting decrease in the day-to-night temperature contrast reduces the
day-to-night pressure gradient that drives the circulation, resulting in weaker
wind speeds. The results from our GCM experiments qualitatively agree with
previous theory which found that the fractional day-night temperature contrast
of ultra-hot Jupiters should decrease with increasing equilibrium temperature
due to hydrogen dissociation and recombination. Lastly, we compute full-phase
light curves from our suite of GCM experiments, finding that the reduced
day-to-night temperature contrast in ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres causes a
smaller phase curve amplitude. The reduction in phase curve amplitude due to
hydrogen dissociation and recombination could explain the relatively small
phase curve amplitudes of observed ultra-hot Jupiters.

situation where predictors and responses are not observed in matching pairs

collection and uncertainty in data integration. Mismatched pairs can
considerably impact the model fit and disrupt the estimation of regression
parameters. In this paper, we present a method to adjust for such mismatches
under ``partial shuffling"" in which a sufficiently large fraction of
(predictors, response)-pairs are observed in their correct correspondence. The
proposed approach is based on a pseudo-likelihood in which each term takes the
form of a two-component mixture density. Expectation-Maximization schemes are
proposed for optimization, which (i) scale favorably in the number of samples,
and (ii) achieve excellent statistical performance relative to an oracle that
has access to the correct pairings as certified by simulations and case
studies. In particular, the proposed approach can tolerate considerably larger
fraction of mismatches than existing approaches, and enables estimation of the
noise level as well as the fraction of mismatches. Inference for the resulting
estimator (standard errors, confidence intervals) can be based on established
theory for composite likelihood estimation. Along the way, we also propose a
statistical test for the presence of mismatches and establish its consistency

the susceptibility exhibits long tails while its average value decreases
rapidly as disorder increases; and (2) the ergodic phase, in which the

disorder. This distinction in the average value of the susceptibility between
the two phases develops readily for systems with ten or more spins. Therefore,
recently built networks of qubits subject to a local drive can simulate

recently, they have also been exploited in mechanical metamaterials, where the
geometry of highly deformable structures is responsible for their unusual
properties, such as negative Poisson's ratio, mechanical cloaking, and tunable
phononic band gaps. Understanding how such structures deform in response to
applied external loads is thus crucial for designing novel mechanical
metamaterials. Here we present a method for predicting the linear response of
infinite 2D solid structures with circular holes and inclusions by employing
analogies with electrostatics. Just like an external electric field induces
polarization (dipoles, quadrupoles and other multipoles) of conductive and
dielectric objects, external stress induces elastic multipoles inside holes and
inclusions. Stresses generated by these induced elastic multipoles then lead to
interactions between holes and inclusions, which induce additional polarization
and thus additional deformation of holes and inclusions. We present a method
that expands the induced polarization in a series of elastic multipoles, which
systematically takes into account the interactions of inclusions and holes with
the external stress field and also between them. The results of our method show
good agreement with both linear finite element simulations and experiments.

precisely characterizing which functions can be realized with finite norm. This
was settled for univariate univariate functions in Savarese et al. (2019),

second derivative of the function. We extend the characterization to
multivariate functions (i.e., networks with d input units), relating the
required norm to the L1-norm of the Radon transform of a (d+1)/2-power
Laplacian of the function. This characterization allows us to show that all

global explanation of the cosmic history from a non-singular initial state in
the very early universe up to our days and further into the final de Sitter

for the early inflation and its graceful exit, as well as a powerful mechanism
for generating the large entropy of the current universe. The energy-momentum
tensor of matter is generally non-conserved in such context owing to particle
creation or annihilation. We analyze general thermodynamical aspects of
particle and entropy production in the RVM. We first study the entropy of
particles in the comoving volume during the early universe and late universe.
Then, in order to obtain a more physical interpretation, we pay attention to
the entropy contribution from the cosmological apparent horizon, its interior

internal gravity waves, which could be excited stochastically by convection in
the cores of these stars. The detection of internal gravity waves in massive
stars would help distinguish between massive stars with convective or radiative
cores, determine core size, and would provide important constraints on massive
star structure and evolution. In this work, we study the observational
signature of internal gravity waves generated by core convection. We calculate
the \textit{wave transfer function}, which links the internal gravity wave
amplitude at the base of the radiative zone to the surface luminosity
variation. This transfer function varies by many orders of magnitude for
frequencies $\lesssim 1 \, {\rm d}^{-1}$, and has regularly-spaced peaks near
$1 \, {\rm d}^{-1}$ due to standing modes. This is inconsistent with the
observed spectra which have smooth ``red noise'' profiles, without the
predicted regularly-spaced peaks. The wave transfer function is only meaningful
if the waves stay predominately linear. We next show that this is the case: low
frequency traveling waves do not break unless their luminosity exceeds the
radiative luminosity of the star; and, the observed luminosity fluctuations at
high frequencies are so small that standing modes would be stable to nonlinear
instability. These simple calculations suggest that the observed low-frequency
photometric variability in massive stars is not due to internal gravity waves
generated in the core of these stars. We finish with a discussion of
(sub)surface convection, which produces low-frequency variability in low-mass
stars, very similar to that observed in Bowman et al. (2019) in higher mass

correlation between star formation and host halo accretion histories of
star-forming (SF) central galaxies from the scatter of the stellar-to-halo mass
relation (SHMR). SF galaxies are found to have a tight relationship between
their star formation rates and stellar masses on the so-called ""star-forming
sequence"" (SFS), which characterizes their SF histories and $M_*$ growths.
Meanwhile, observed SHMR constraints connect $M_*$ growth to halo accretion
history. Combining these observed trends with a cosmological $N$-body
simulation, we present flexible models that track the SF, $M_*$, and halo
accretion histories of SF central galaxies at $z<1$ while reproducing the
observed stellar mass function and SFS in SDSS DR7. We find that the scatter in
SHMR at $M_h=10^{12}M_\odot$, $\sigma_{M_*|M_h=10^{12}M_\odot}$, is sensitive
to the timescale of star formation variability, $t_{\rm duty}$, and the
correlation coefficient, $r$, between SF and halo accretion histories: shorter
$t_{\rm duty}$ and higher $r$ both result in tighter
$\sigma_{M_*|M_h=10^{12}M_\odot}$. To reproduce a constant 0.2 dex scatter over
$z=1-0$, our models require $t_{\rm duty}\leq1.5$ Gyr for $r=0.99$ or $r>0.6$

candidate in particular, Solar Sibling 1, has both chemistry and actions
similar enough to the solar values that strong interactions with the bar or

at defining simple but robust and meaningful physical parameters that can be
used to trace the coexistence of widely diverse stellar components: younger
stellar populations superimposed on the bulk of older ones. We produce spectra
of galaxies closely mimicking data from the forthcoming Stellar Populations at
intermediate redshifts Survey (StePS), a survey that uses the WEAVE
spectrograph on the William Herschel Telescope. First, we assess our ability to
reliably measure both ultraviolet and optical spectral indices in galaxies of
different spectral types for typically expected signal-to-noise levels. Then,
we analyze such mock spectra with a Bayesian approach, deriving the probability
density function of r- and u-band light-weighted ages as well as of their
difference. We find that the ultraviolet indices significantly narrow the
uncertainties in estimating the r- and u-band light-weighted ages and their
difference in individual galaxies. These diagnostics, robustly retrievable for
large galaxy samples even when observed at moderate signal-to-noise ratios,
allow us to identify secondary episodes of star formation up to an age of ~0.1
Gyr for stellar populations older than ~1.5 Gyr, pushing up to an age of ~1 Gyr
for stellar populations older than ~5 Gyr. The difference between r-band and
u-band light-weighted ages is shown to be a powerful diagnostic to characterize
and constrain extended star-formation histories and the presence of young
stellar populations on top of older ones. This parameter can be used to explore
the interplay between different galaxy star-formation histories and physical

of the dark matter distribution are largely unaffected by the baryonic

that the generation of strong helical magnetic fields from a helicity imbalance

linear instability regime the helicity imbalance of the fermion sector causes
an exponential growth(damping) of magnetic field modes with right(left) handed

Secondary growth of unstable modes accelerates the helicity transfer from
fermions to gauge fields and ultimately leads to the emergence of a
self-similar scaling regime characteristic of decaying turbulence, where
magnetic helicity is efficiently transferred to macroscopic length scales.
Within this turbulent regime the evolution of magnetic helicity spectrum can be
described by an infrared power-spectrum with spectral exponent $\kappa$ and

prototypical LLAGN, using XMM-Newton, Suzaku and NuSTAR observations, taken
from 2001 to 2017. This is the first time that results from NuSTAR observations
are reported for NGC 1052. On the technical aspects, we found a
wavelength-dependent calibration issue between simultaneous XMM-Newton and

\Gamma_{NuSTAR}- \Gamma_{XMM-Newton}=0.17\pm0.04}$. We use ancillary Chandra
data to decontaminate the nuclear spectrum from circumnuclear contributors. We
find that two baseline models can fit the broad (0.5-50 keV) X-ray spectrum of
the source. One consists of a power-law like continuum which is absorbed by a
uniform absorber, reflection from neutral material, and a separate power-law
component in the soft band. The second model presents a clumpy absorber. The
reflection component is still present, but not the soft band power-law.
Instead, absorption by a warm absorber is necessary to fit the spectra. This is
the first time that a reflection component is established in this object,
thanks to high energy data from NuSTAR. This component is constant in flux and

the behaviour of this source better as it is $\sim$ 200 times more likely than
the uniform absober while it yields to smaller intrinsic variations.

merger induced star-forming activity, respectively. We additionally identify
merger samples from visual inspection and from Gini-M20 morphological
parameters. Regardless of the merger criteria adopted, the clumpiness
distribution of merging systems is different from that of normal isolated disks
at > 99.5 % confidence level, with the former reaching higher clumpiness
values, up to 20 % of the total galaxy emission. We confirm the merger induced
clumpiness enhancement with novel hydrodynamical simulations of colliding
galaxies with gas fractions typical of z ~ 0.7. Multi-wavelength images of
three starbursts in the CANDELS field support the young nature of clumps, which
are likely merger products rather than older pre-existing structures. Finally,
for a subset of 19 starbursts with existing near-IR rest frame spectroscopy, we
find that the clumpiness is mildly anti-correlated with the merger phase,
decreasing towards final coalescence. Our result can explain recent ALMA
detections of clumps in hyperluminous high-z starbursts, while normal objects
are smooth. This work raises a question on the role of mergers on the origin of
clumps in high redshift galaxies in general.

machine learning techniques have been proposed by Torlai and Melko as well as
Varsamopoulos et al. In these approaches, a so called high level decoder is
used to post-correct an underlying decoder by correcting logical errors. A
significant problem is that these methods require large amounts of training
data even for relatively small code distances. The above-mentioned methods were
tested on the rotated surface code which encodes one logical qubit. Here, we
show that they are viable even for the toric surface code which encodes two
logical qubits. Furthermore, we explain how symmetries of the toric code can be
exploited to reduce the amount of training data that is required to obtain good
decoding results. Finally, we compare different underlying decoders and show
that the accuracy of high level decoding noticeably depends on the quality of
the underlying decoder in the realistic case of imperfect training.

the geometry of the functional space and by the parameterization of this space

excursion and transition back to red, during core helium burning phase. Models
with overshoot outside this range of $f$ values kept the star in the red
supergiant state throughout the post helium ignition phases. The surface CNO
abundance shows enrichment post-main-sequence and again around the time when
helium is exhausted in core. These evolutionary changes in surface CNO
abundance are indistinguishable in the currently available observations due to
large observational uncertainties. However, these observations may distinguish
between the ratios of surface nitrogen to oxygen at different evolutionary
stages of the star. We also compare the effects of convective overshoot on
various parameters related to likelihood of explosion of a star as opposed to
collapse to a black hole. These parameters are the compactness parameter,
M$_4$, and $\mu_4$. Combination $\mu_4 \times $M$_4$, and $\mu_4$ have similar

observable by ground-based detectors will be emitted by compact binaries in
quasi-circular orbits, the growing number of detections suggests the
possibility of detecting waves from binaries with non-negligible orbital
eccentricity in the near future. Several gravitational wave models incorporate
the effects of small orbital eccentricities ($e \lesssim 0.2$), but these
models may not be sufficient to analyze waves from systems with moderate
eccentricity. We recently developed a gravitational wave model that faithfully
accounts for eccentric corrections in the moderate eccentricity regime ($e
\lesssim 0.8$ for certain source masses) at 3rd post-Newtonian order. Here we
consider the data analysis implications of this particular waveform model by
producing and analyzing posteriors via Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We
find that the accuracy to which eccentricity and source masses can be measured
can increase by 2 orders of magnitude with increasing eccentricity of the
signal. We also find that signals with low eccentricity can be confidently
identified as eccentric as soon as their eccentricity exceeds 0.008 (0.05) for
low (high) mass systems, suggesting eccentric detections are likely to come
first from low-mass systems. We complete our analysis by investigating the
systematic (mismodeling) error inherent in our post-Newtonian model, finding
that for signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 15, the systematic error is
below the statistical error for eccentricities as high as 0.8 (0.5) for low
(high) mass systems. We also investigate the systematic error that arises from
using a model that neglects eccentricity when the signal is truly eccentric,
finding that the systematic error exceeds the statistical error in mass for
eccentricities as small as 0.02.

magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. Dynamic MRI requires rapid
data acquisition for the study of moving organs such as the heart. Existing

in the absence of ground-truth data, resulting in low image quality. We
introduce a generalized version of the deep-image-prior approach, which
optimizes the network weights to fit a sequence of sparsely acquired dynamic
MRI measurements. Our method needs neither prior training nor additional data.
In particular, for cardiac images, it does not require the marking of
heartbeats or the reordering of spokes. The key ingredients of our method are
threefold: 1) a fixed low-dimensional manifold that encodes the temporal
variations of images; 2) a network that maps the manifold into a more
expressive latent space; and 3) a convolutional neural network that generates a
dynamic series of MRI images from the latent variables and that favors their
consistency with the measurements in k-space. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively in both retrospective

first unsupervised deep-learning-based method that can reconstruct the
continuous variation of dynamic MRI sequences with high spatial resolution.

conditions. For mixed-variable problems, existing Bayesian Optimization (BO)
approaches represent qualitative factors by dummy variables first and then fit
a standard Gaussian process (GP) model with numerical variables as the

mixed-variable GP modeling with the BO framework for materials design. LVGP is
a fundamentally different approach that maps qualitative design variables to

produces the so-called ""weight transport problem"" for biological models of

the forward weights used to process stimuli. This weight transport problem has
been considered so hard that popular proposals for biological learning assume
that the backward weights are simply random, as in the feedback alignment

networks. Here we show how the discontinuity introduced in a spiking system can
lead to a solution to this problem. The resulting algorithm is a special case
of an estimator used for causal inference in econometrics, regression
discontinuity design. We show empirically that this algorithm rapidly makes the
backward weights approximate the forward weights. As the backward weights
become correct, this improves learning performance over feedback alignment on

that a simple learning rule in a spiking network can allow neurons to produce

thermalization in the dual CFT. It is sometimes argued that if the CFT
evolution shows evidence of large redshift in gravity, then we have seen black
hole formation in the CFT. We argue that this is not the case: a clock falling
towards the horizon increases its redshift but remains intact as a clock; thus
it is not `thermalized'. Instead, thermalization should correspond to a new
phase after the phase of large redshift, where the infalling object turns into
fuzzballs on reaching within planck distance of the horizon. We compute simple
examples of the scattering vertex in the D1D5 CFT which, after many iterations,
would lead to thermalization. An initial state made of two left-moving and two
right-moving excitations corresponds, in gravity, to two gravitons heading
towards each other. The thermalization vertex in the CFT breaks these
excitations into multiple excitations on the left and right sides; we compute
the amplitudes for several of these processes. We find secular terms that grow
as $t^2$ instead of oscillating with $t$; we conjecture that this may be a
feature of processes leading to thermalization.

well-studied globular clusters. Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars undergoing
hot bottom burning (HBB) are thought to be prime candidates for producing
sodium-rich oxygen-poor material and expelling it into the cluster ISM. The
22Ne(p,gamma)23Na reaction has been shown to strongly influence the amount of
23Na produced during HBB. This reaction is also important for classical novae
nucleosynthesis, with sensitivity studies showing that the abundances of
several isotopes in the Ne-Al region are significantly altered when varying the
reaction rate between available compilations. Here we present the first inverse
kinematics measurements of key resonances strengths as well as the direct
capture S-factor. Together, this study represents the largest centre of mass
energy range (149-1222 keV) over which this reaction has been measured in a
single experiment. Our results for low-energy resonances at Ecm=149, 181 and
248 keV are in good agreement with recent forward kinematics results; we also
find a direct capture S-factor consistent with the literature value of 62
keV.b. However, in the case of the important reference resonance at Ecm = 458
keV we find a strength value of wg=0.44 +/- 0.02 eV, which is significantly
lower than recent results. Using our new recommended rate we explore the impact
of these results on both AGB star and classical novae nucleosynthesis. In the
case of AGB stars we see very little abundance changes with respect to the rate
included in the STARLIB-2013. However, we observe changes of up to a factor of
2 in isotopes produced in both the carbon-oxygen (CO) and oxygen-neon (ONe)
classical novae models considered here. The 22Ne(p,gamma)23Na reaction rate is
now sufficiently well constrained to not significantly contribute toward
abundance uncertainties from classical novae nucleosynthesis models.

investigate the cosmological effects of a non-minimal coupled scalar field. By
treating the deformation perturbatively, I derive the deformed gravitational
action which includes the nearest order of curvature corrections. Then working
more generally, I derive the deformed scalar-tensor constraint to all orders
and I find that the momenta and spatial derivatives from gravity and matter
must combine in a very specific form. It suggests that the deformation should
be equally affected by matter field derivatives as it is by gravitational

attack cost in both the gate count and depth-times-width cost models. In NIST's

defined based on the concrete cost of quantum key search against AES. We
present new, lower cost estimates for each category, so our work has immediate

including unit tests and code to reproduce our quantum resource estimates. To
the best of our knowledge, these are the first two such full implementations

Compared with our previous method, T-Linkage RANSAC is more tolerant of
observation uncertainties, i.e., the number of sides of the target being

tracking system with Multi-Model Association (MMA) is built upon the

However, IoT sensors and deep learning (DL) algorithms, both are known for

evaluate their impact on CNN, LSTM, and GRU-based PdM systems. The obtained
results demonstrate that FDI attacks on even a few IoT sensors can strongly
defect the RUL prediction. However, the GRU-based PdM model performs better in
terms of accuracy and resiliency. Lastly, we perform a study on the GRU-based

In this work, we quantify the level of engagement in dynamic complex systems of
interactions, modeled as networks. We focus on interaction networks for which
the dynamics of the interactions are coupled with that of the topology, such as
online messaging, forums, and emails. We define two indices to capture the
temporal level of engagement: the Temporal Network (edge) Intensity index, and
the Temporal Dominance Inequality index. Our surprising results are that these
measures are stationary for most measured networks, regardless of vast
fluctuations in the size of the networks in time. Moreover, more than 80% of
weekly changes in the indices values are bounded by less than 10%. The indices
are stable between the temporal evolution of a network but are different
between networks, and a classifier can determine the network the temporal
indices belong to with high success. We find an exception in the Enron
management email exchange during the year before its disintegration, in which
both indices show high volatility throughout the inspected period.

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is notoriously difficult to control the behavior of reinforcement learning
agents. Agents often learn to exploit the environment or reward signal and need
to be retrained multiple times. The multi-objective reinforcement learning
(MORL) framework separates a reward function into several objectives. An ideal
MORL agent learns to generalize to novel combinations of objectives allowing
for better control of an agent's behavior without requiring retraining. Many
MORL approaches use a weight vector to parameterize the importance of each
objective. However, this approach suffers from lack of expressiveness and
interpretability. We propose using propositional logic to specify the
importance of multiple objectives. By using a logic where predicates correspond
directly to objectives, specifications are inherently more interpretable.
Additionally the set of specifications that can be expressed with formal
languages is a superset of what can be expressed by weight vectors. In this
paper, we define a formal language based on propositional logic with
quantitative semantics. We encode logical specifications using a recurrent
neural network and show that MORL agents parameterized by these encodings are
able to generalize to novel specifications over objectives and achieve
performance comparable to single objective baselines.

a common interest is to unveil important latent links between different pairs

statistical uncertainty associated with the identification of latent links
still remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose the method of
statistical inference on membership profiles in large networks (SIMPLE) in the
setting of degree-corrected mixed membership model, where the null hypothesis
assumes that the pair of nodes share the same profile of community memberships.
In the simpler case of no degree heterogeneity, the model reduces to the mixed
membership model for which an alternative more robust test is also proposed.
Both tests are of the Hotelling-type statistics based on the rows of empirical
eigenvectors or their ratios, whose asymptotic covariance matrices are very
challenging to derive and estimate. Nevertheless, their analytical expressions
are unveiled and the unknown covariance matrices are consistently estimated.
Under some mild regularity conditions, we establish the exact limiting
distributions of the two forms of SIMPLE test statistics under the null
hypothesis and contiguous alternative hypothesis. They are the chi-square
distributions and the noncentral chi-square distributions, respectively, with
degrees of freedom depending on whether the degrees are corrected or not. We
also address the important issue of estimating the unknown number of
communities and establish the asymptotic properties of the associated test
statistics. The advantages and practical utility of our new procedures in terms
of both size and power are demonstrated through several simulation examples and
real network applications.

(SA) to a model that aims to predict the evolution and properties of the whole

sciences, but is a relatively novel tool for the evaluation of astrophysical
models. We perform a multi-parameter exploration of the GALFORM semi-analytic
galaxy formation model, to compute how sensitive the present-day K-band
luminosity function is to varying different model parameters. The parameter
space is scanned using a low-discrepancy sampling technique proposed by
Saltelli. We first demonstrate the usefulness of the SA approach by varying
just two model parameters, one which controls supernova feedback and the other
the heating of gas by AGN. The SA analysis matches our physical intuition
regarding how these parameters affect the predictions for different parts of
the galaxy luminosity function. We then use SA to compute Sobol' sensitivity
indices varying seven model parameters, connecting the variance in the model
output to the variance in the input parameters. The sensitivity is computed in
luminosity bins, allowing us to probe the origin of the model predictions in
detail. We discover that the SA correctly identifies the least- and most
important parameters. Moreover, the SA also captures the combined responses of
varying multiple parameters at the same time. Our study marks a much needed
step away from the traditional ""one-at-a-time"" parameter variation often used
in this area and improves the transparency of multi-parameter models of galaxy
formation.

to design feedback control policies for 3D bipedal walking. Existing RL
algorithms are often trained in an end-to-end manner or rely on prior knowledge
of some reference joint trajectories. Different from these studies, we propose
a novel policy structure that appropriately incorporates physical insights
gained from the hybrid nature of the walking dynamics and the well-established
hybrid zero dynamics approach for 3D bipedal walking. As a result, the overall
RL framework has several key advantages, including lightweight network
structure, short training time, and less dependence on prior knowledge. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on Cassie, a challenging
3D bipedal robot. The proposed solution produces stable limit walking cycles
that can track various walking speed in different directions. Surprisingly,
without specifically trained with disturbances to achieve robustness, it also
performs robustly against various adversarial forces applied to the torso
towards both the forward and the backward directions.

nearby targets, due to its consideration of third-order terms of Roemer delay.
PEXO is able to avoid the bias introduced by decoupling the target system and
the solar system and to account for the atmospheric effects which set a
practical limit for ground-based radial velocities close to 1 cm/s. Considering

$P$ of planar points (each corresponding to a topological feature) above the
line $Y=X$, as well as the line $Y=X$ itself, i.e., ${\cal
P}=P\cup\{(x,y)|y=x\}$. Given a set of persistence diagrams ${\cal
P}_1,...,{\cal P}_m$, for the data reduction purpose, one way to summarize
their topological features is to compute the {\em center} ${\cal C}$ of them
first under the bottleneck distance. We consider two discrete versions and one
continuous version. For technical reasons, we first focus on the case when
$|P_i|$'s are all the same (i.e., all have the same size $n$), and the problem
is to compute a center point set $C$ under the bottleneck matching distance. We
show, by a non-trivial reduction from the Planar 3D-Matching problem, that this
problem is NP-hard even when $m=3$ diagrams are given. This implies that the
general center problem for persistence diagrams under the bottleneck distance,
when $P_i$'s possibly have different sizes, is also NP-hard when $m\geq 3$. On
the positive side, we show that this problem is polynomially solvable when
$m=2$ and admits a factor-2 approximation for $m\geq 3$. These positive results
hold for any $L_p$ metric when $P_i$'s are point sets of the same size, and
also hold for the case when $P_i$'s have different sizes in the $L_\infty$
metric (i.e., for the Center Persistence Diagram problem). This is the best
possible in polynomial time for the Center Persistence Diagram under the
bottleneck distance unless P = NP. All these results hold for both of the
discrete versions as well as the continuous version; in fact, the NP-hardness
and approximation results also hold under the Wasserstein distance for the
continuous version.

spectral differences between two functional inputs. Dependencies for functional

priors on both the input spectra and the output co-kriging covariance matrix,
which allows the emulator to learn and incorporate important physics (e.g.,
dominant input frequencies, output curve properties). Finally, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed SpeD emulator in a real-world study on

ferromagnetic interactions are assumed in addition to the Helfrich-Polyakov
Hamiltonian for membranes. The surface (or frame) tension $\tau$ is calculated
under both isotropic and uniaxial strain conditions, and this calculation
clarifies a non-trivial dependence of $\tau$ on the skyrmion, stripe, and
ferromagnetic phases. We find that the variation of $\tau$ with respect to the
applied magnetic field in the skyrmion phase is accompanied by a variation of
the total number of skyrmions. Moreover, we find that this total number
variation is qualitatively consistent with a recent experimental result for the
creation/annihilation of skyrmions of 3D crystalline material under uniaxial

flux-surfaces into the flow. An MHD equilibrium is reached when the flow
relaxes and force balance is achieved. We ask what classes of MHD equilibria
can be accessed from a given initial state via smooth incompressible ideal
motion. It is found that certain boundary displacements are formally not
supported. This follows from yet another investigation of the
Hahm--Kulsrud--Taylor (HKT) problem, which highlights the resonant behaviour
near a rational layer formed by a set of degenerate critical points in the
flux-function. When trying to retain the mirror symmetry of the flux-function
with respect to the resonant layer, the vector field that generates the
volume-preserving diffeomorphism vanishes at the identity to all order in the

another, generic stress prediction models (i.e., models that predict the stress
of any person) perform crudely. Only person-specific ones (i.e., models that
predict the stress of a preordained person) yield reliable predictions, but
they are not adaptable and costly to deploy in real-world environments. For
illustration, in an office environment, a stress monitoring system that uses
person-specific models would require collecting new data and training a new
model for every employee. Moreover, once deployed, the models would deteriorate
and need expensive periodic upgrades because stress is dynamic and depends on
unforeseeable factors. We propose a simple, yet practical and cost effective
calibration technique that derives an accurate and personalized stress
prediction model from physiological samples collected from a large population.
We validate our approach on two stress datasets. The results show that our
technique performs much better than a generic model. For instance, a generic
model achieved only a 42.5% accuracy. However, with only 100 calibration
samples, we raised its accuracy to 95.2% We also propose a blueprint for a
stress monitoring system based on our strategy, and we debate its merits and

the existence of {\it stable}, static, negative mass bubbles in an
asymptotically de Sitter space-time. The bubbles are solutions of the Einstein
equations and correspond to an interior region of space-time containing a
specific mass distribution, separated by a thin wall from the exact, negative
mass Schwarzschild-de Sitter space-time in the exterior. We apply the Israel
junction conditions at the wall. For the case of an interior corresponding
simply to de Sitter space-time with a different cosmological constant from the
outside space-time, separated by a thin wall with energy density that is
independent of the radius, we find static but unstable solutions which satisfy
the dominant energy condition everywhere. The bubbles can collapse through
spherically symmetric configurations to the exact, singular, negative mass
Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution. Interestingly, this provides a
counter-example of the cosmic censorship hypothesis. Alternatively, the
junction conditions can be used to give rise to an interior mass distribution
that depends on the potential for the radius of the wall. We show that for no
choice of the potential, for positive energy density on the wall that is
independent of the radius, can we get a solution that is non-singular at the
origin. However, if we allow the energy density on the wall to depend on the
radius of the bubble, we can find {\it stable}, static, non-singular solutions
of negative mass which everywhere satisfy the dominant energy condition.

via interlayer exchange coupling (IEC). Macrospin model calculations can
qualitatively account for the relation between the anisotropy field and the
IEC. Among the structures studied, IEC is the largest for the asymmetric
Ir/Co/Pt multilayers: the exchange coupling field exceeds 3 T and consequently,
the anisotropy field approaches 10 T. Third, comparing the asymmetric Ir/Co/Pt
and Pt/Co/Ir structures, we find the IEC and, to some extent, the interface PMA
are stronger for the former than the latter. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism
studies suggest that the proximity induced magnetization in Pt is larger for
the Ir/Co/Pt multilayers than the inverted structure, which may partly account
for the difference in the magnetic properties. These results show the intricate
relation between PMA, IEC and the proximity induced magnetization that can be
exploited to design artificial structures with unique magnetic characteristics.

representations which capture the geometric dependencies between nodes in the
original graph, has gained increasing popularity in a variety of graph analysis
tasks, including node classification and link prediction. Existing
representation learning methods based on graph neural networks and their
variants rely on the aggregation of neighborhood information, which makes it
sensitive to noises in the graph. In this paper, we propose Graph Denoising
Policy Network (short for GDPNet) to learn robust representations from noisy
graph data through reinforcement learning. GDPNet first selects signal
neighborhoods for each node, and then aggregates the information from the
selected neighborhoods to learn node representations for the down-stream tasks.
Specifically, in the signal neighborhood selection phase, GDPNet optimizes the
neighborhood for each target node by formulating the process of removing noisy
neighborhoods as a Markov decision process and learning a policy with
task-specific rewards received from the representation learning phase. In the
representation learning phase, GDPNet aggregates features from signal neighbors
to generate node representations for down-stream tasks, and provides
task-specific rewards to the signal neighbor selection phase. These two phases
are jointly trained to select optimal sets of neighbors for target nodes with
maximum cumulative task-specific rewards, and to learn robust representations
for nodes. Experimental results on node classification task demonstrate the
effectiveness of GDNet, outperforming the state-of-the-art graph representation
learning methods on several well-studied datasets. Additionally, GDPNet is
mathematically equivalent to solving the submodular maximizing problem, which
theoretically guarantees the best approximation to the optimal solution with

components for plant breeders and agronomists in understanding the yield of
their crops. To phenotype the panicle density effectively, researchers agree
there is a significant need for computer vision-based object detection
techniques. Especially in recent times, research in deep learning-based object
detection shows promising results in various agricultural studies. However,
training such systems usually requires a lot of bounding-box labeled data.
Since crops vary by both environmental and genetic conditions, acquisition of
huge amount of labeled image datasets for each crop is expensive and
time-consuming. Thus, to catalyze the widespread usage of automatic object
detection for crop phenotyping, a cost-effective method to develop such
automated systems is essential. We propose a point supervision based active
learning approach for panicle detection in cereal crops. In our approach, the
model constantly interacts with a human annotator by iteratively querying the
labels for only the most informative images, as opposed to all images in a
dataset. Our query method is specifically designed for cereal crops which
usually tend to have panicles with low variance in appearance. Our method
reduces labeling costs by intelligently leveraging low-cost weak labels (object
centers) for picking the most informative images for which strong labels
(bounding boxes) are required. We show promising results on two publicly
available cereal crop datasets - Sorghum and Wheat. On Sorghum, 6 variants of
our proposed method outperform the best baseline method with more than 55%
savings in labeling time. Similarly, on Wheat, 3 variants of our proposed

taking into account high-order correlation effects beyond the Gaussian level.
Keeping the full electronic Hilbert space, the complexity is increased only by
a polynomial scaling factor relative to the exact diagonalization calculation
for pure electrons. As an example, we use this method to study ground-state

  Data Using Bayesian Minimum Description Length",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In modern business modeling and analytics, data monitoring plays a critical
role. Nowadays, sophisticated models often rely on hundreds or even thousands
of input variables. Over time, structural changes such as abrupt level shifts
or trend slope changes may occur among some of these variables, likely due to
changes in economy or government policies. As a part of data monitoring, it is
important to identify these changepoints, in terms of which variables exhibit
such changes, and what time locations do the changepoints occur. Being alerted
about the changepoints can help modelers decide if models need modification or
rebuilds, while ignoring them may increase risks of model degrading. Simple
process control rules often flag too many false alarms because regular seasonal
fluctuations or steady upward or downward trends usually trigger alerts. To
reduce potential false alarms, we create a novel statistical method based on
the Bayesian Minimum Description Length (BMDL) framework to perform multiple
change-point detection. Our method is capable of detecting all structural
breaks occurred in the past, and automatically handling data with or without
seasonality and/or autocorrelation. It is implemented with computation
algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and can be applied to all
variables in parallel. As an explainable anomaly detection tool, our
changepoint detection method not only triggers alerts, but provides useful
information about the structural breaks, such as the times of changepoints, and
estimation of mean levels and linear slopes before and after the changepoints.
This makes future business analysis and evaluation on the structural breaks
easier.

re-train the CNN for robust OCTA classification. In order to demonstrate the
feasibility of using this method for artificial intelligence (AI) screening of

affected by the finite thickness and thermal mass of the sensor's insulation
layer was well as the corresponding increase of the effective heater size
beyond the radius of the embedded metal heater itself. We also numerically
investigate the dependence of the error on the sample thermal properties,
confirming that the errors are worse in low-k samples. A simple correction
function is also provided, which converts the apparent (erroneous) result from
a standard hot disk TPS measurement to a more accurate value. A standard
polyimide sensor was also optimized using both wet and dry etching to provide
more accurate measurement directly. Experimentally corrected value of k for
Airloy x56 aerogel and a commercial silica aerogel using the numerical
correction factor derived based on the standard TPS sensor is in excellent
agreement with the directly measured value from the TPS sensor using the

large magneto-optical Raman effect from an A$_{1g}$ phonon mode due to the
emergence of ferromagnetic order. The linearly polarized, inelastically
scattered light rotates by ~40$^o$, more than two orders of magnitude larger
than the rotation from MOKE under the same experimental conditions. In CrI$_3$
bilayers, we show that the same A$_{1g}$ phonon mode becomes Davydov-split into
two modes of opposite parity, exhibiting divergent selection rules that depend
on inversion symmetry and the underlying magnetic order. By switching between
the antiferromagnetic states and the fully spin-polarized states with applied
magnetic and electric fields, we demonstrate the magnetoelectrical control over
their selection rules. Our work underscores the unique opportunities provided
by 2D magnets for controlling the combined time-reversal and inversion
symmetries to manipulate Raman optical selection rules and for exploring
emergent magneto-optical effects and spin-phonon coupled physics.

has been proposed recently as a method for joint clustering and optimization of
machine learning models for networked data. The nLasso extends the Lasso from
sparse linear models to clustered graph signals. This paper explores the
duality of nLasso and network flow optimization. We show that, in a very

nLasso solutions via existence of certain network flows. The main conceptual

because of a lack of intrinsic toughening mechanisms, such as the plasticity in
the vicinity of the crack front. As a result, most of the efforts to mitigate
the sudden failure of brittle ceramics have been focused on developing the
extrinsic toughening mechanisms that hinder crack propagation behind the tip,
such as the fiber bridging. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that
the intrinsic toughening arises even in the brittle monolithic ceramic material
such as diamond-like carbon (DLC) when its external dimension reduces down to
sub-micron scales. This unique phenomenon owes its origin to the decrease of
the crack driving force in the small samples, which in turn enables them to
bear high enough stresses to activate the local atomic plasticity. Through
nanomechanical tensile and bending experiments, electron energy loss
spectroscopy analysis, and finite element method for stress distribution
calculation, we confirmed that the local atomic plasticity associated with sp3
to sp2 rehybridization is responsible for the intrinsic toughening.

of a (possibly infinite dimensional) parameter, is via some forward operator,
which is the concatenation of the observation operator with the
parameter-to-state-map for the underlying model. Recently, all-at-once
formulations have been considered as an alternative to this reduced
formulation, avoiding the use of a parameter-to-state map, which would
sometimes lead to too restrictive conditions. Here the model and the
observation are considered simultaneously as one large system with the state
and the parameter as unknowns. A still more general formulation of inverse
problems, containing both the reduced and the all-at-once formulation, but also
the well-known and highly versatile so-called variational approach (also called
Kohn-Vogelius functional approach) as special cases, is to formulate the
inverse problem as a minimization problem -- instead of an equation -- for the
state and parameter. Regularization can be incorporated via imposing
constraints and/or adding regularization terms to the objective. In this paper,
after giving a motivation by formulating the electrical impedance tomography
(EIT) problem by means of the classical Kohn-Vogelius functional, we will dwell
on the regularization aspects for such variational formulations in an abstract
setting. Indeed, combination of regularization by constraints and by
penalization leads to new methods that are applicable without solving forward
problems. In particular, for the EIT problem we will consider a method
employing box constraints in a very natural manner to incorporate the
discrepancy principle for regularization parameter choice as well as a priori
information on the searched for conductivity.

spectrometer designed for a small 6U micro-satellite. As a relatively
inexpensive yet capable Earth-orbiting instrument, MiSolFA is designed to image
the high-energy regions of solar flares from a different perspective than that
of Solar Orbiter's STIX, operating from a highly elliptical heliocentric orbit.
Two instruments working together in this way would provide a 3-dimensional view
of X-ray emitting regions and can bypass the dynamic range limitation
preventing simultaneous coronal and chromospheric imaging. Stereoscopic X-ray
observations would also contain valuable information about the anisotropy of
the flare-accelerated electron distribution. To perform these types of
observations, MiSolFA must be capable of imaging sources with energies between
10 and 100 keV, with 10 arcsec angular resolution. MiSolFA's Imager will be the
most compact X-ray imaging spectrometer in space. Scaling down the volume by a
factor of ten from previous instrument designs requires special considerations.
Here we present the design principles of the MiSolFA X-ray optics, discuss the
necessary compromises, and evaluate the performance of the Engineering Model.

cause delays and failures on some payment paths. For atomic transfer schemes,
these straggling paths stall the whole transfer. We show that the latency of
transfers reduces when redundant payment paths are added. This frees up
liquidity in payment channels and hence increases the throughput of the
network. We devise Boomerang, a generic technique to be used on top of

scheme leads to 40% latency reduction and 2x throughput increase. We build on
ideas from publicly verifiable secret sharing, such that Alice learns a secret

using Boomerang contracts, which allow Alice to revert the transfer iff she has
learned Bob's secret. We implement the Boomerang contract in Bitcoin Script.

Furthermore, highlighting cannot convey whether the classification depends on
the mere presence of parts or on a specific spatial relation between them.

ablation geometry of 50 nm thick nickel film coated on a glass plate under
nanosecond laser ablation. A detailed study with varying background pressure
and laser energy of time of flight (TOF) spectra of ionic and other neutral
transitions from plasma is undertaken. The results indicate that TOF spectra
recorded for different neutral transitions exhibit different dynamical behavior
(the slower peak of the neutral emission becomes faster with background
pressure). Similar observation is seen for the ionic species as well. These
observations have similarity to some of the reported double-layer concepts.
However, the calculated electric fields from the acceleration appear to be
anomalously higher. Along with the acceleration observed for the ionic and
neutral lines, significant asymmetry in spectral shape is observed for neutral
nickel line (712.2 nm) along with spectral broadening as the background
pressure increases. This large asymmetry is indicative of micro electric fields
present inside the laser produced plasma plume which may result in a continuous
acceleration of ions. Interestingly, the asymmetry in spectral broadening
exhibits temporal and spatial dependence which indicates that electric field is
present in the plasma plume even for longer duration and also over a
significant distance.

probability that a user takes a predefined action on an advertiser's website,
is a fundamental task for estimating the value of displaying an advertisement
to a user. There are two main challenges in CVR prediction due to delayed
feedback. First, some positive labels are not correctly observed in training
data because some conversions do not occur immediately after a click. Second,
delay mechanisms are not uniform among instances, meaning some positive
feedback are much more frequently observed than others. It is widely
acknowledged that these problems lead to severe bias in CVR prediction. To
overcome these challenges, we propose two unbiased estimators: one for CVR
prediction and the other for bias estimation. Subsequently, we propose a dual
learning algorithm in which a CVR predictor and a bias estimator are trained in
alternating fashion using only observable conversions. The proposed algorithm
is the first of its kind to address the two major challenges in a theoretically
sophisticated manner. Empirical evaluations using synthetic datasets
demonstrate the practical value of the proposed approach.

the net flow RSP and adding capacity constraints on edge flows. The standard
RSP is a model of movement, or spread, through a network interpolating between
a random-walk and a shortest-path behavior [30, 42, 49]. The framework assumes
a unit flow injected into a source node and collected from a target node with
flows minimizing the expected transportation cost, together with a relative
entropy regularization term. In this context, the present work first develops
the net flow RSP model considering that edge flows in opposite directions
neutralize each other (as in electric networks), and proposes an algorithm for
computing the expected routing costs between all pairs of nodes. This quantity
is called the net flow RSP dissimilarity measure between nodes. Experimental
comparisons on node clustering tasks indicate that the net flow RSP
dissimilarity is competitive with other state-of-the-art dissimilarities. In
the second part of the paper, it is shown how to introduce capacity constraints
on edge flows, and a procedure is developed to solve this constrained problem
by exploiting Lagrangian duality. These two extensions should improve
significantly the scope of applications of the RSP framework.

uses the Shakura-Sunyaev prescription for angular momentum transport, which we
know now to be at best inaccurate, it is surprisingly efficient in reproducing
the outbursts of dwarf novae and soft X-ray transients, provided that some
ingredients, such as irradiation of the accretion disc and of the donor star,
mass transfer variations, truncation of the inner disc, etc., are added to the
basic model. As recently realized, taking into account the existence of winds
and outflows and of the torque they exert on the accretion disc may
significantly impact the model. I also discuss the origin of the superoutbursts
that are probably due to a combination of variations of the mass transfer rate
and of a tidal instability. I finally mention a number of unsolved problems and
caveats, among which the most embarrassing one is the modelling of the low
state. Despite significant progresses in the past few years both on our
understanding of angular momentum transport, the DIM is still needed for
understanding transient systems.

clean inputs from their corrupted versions, in the autoencoders to achieve

nine participants with early stage PD were assessed based on two types of

gait disorder (PIGD) and subtotal scores for subscales I, II, and III were

Tinetti gait and balance, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed-Up and Go (TUG),
Functional Reach (FR), Freezing of Gait (FOG), Mini Mental State Examination
(MMSE), and Melbourne Edge Test (MET). Falls were recorded each month for 6
months. Clustering of patients via Finite Mixture Model (FMM) was conducted.
Three clusters of patients were found: non-or single-fallers, low frequency
fallers, and high frequency fallers. Several factors that are important to
clustering PD patients were identified: UPDRS subscales II and III subtotals,
PIGD and SE ADL. However these factors could not differentiate PD patients with
low frequency fallers from high frequency fallers. While Tinetti,TUG, and BBS
turned to be important factors in clustering PD patients, and could
differentiate the three clusters. FMM is able to cluster people with PD into
three groups. We obtain several factors important to explaining the clusters
and also found different role of disease specific measures and functional tests

these complex nonlinear effects and to account for their evolution in time and
space. Here, this long-standing issue is solved by the derivation of
population-recipe-based expressions for graphene's nonperturbative
nonlinearities. The presented framework successfully predicts and explains the
various nonlinearity magnitudes and signs observed for graphene over the past
decade, while also being compatible with the nonlinear pulse propagation
formalism commonly used for waveguides.

of segmented objects in terms of their Betti numbers and then drive the
proposed segmentations to contain the specified topological features.
Importantly this process does not require any ground-truth labels, just prior
knowledge of the topology of the structure being segmented. We demonstrate our
approach in three experiments. Firstly we create a synthetic task in which
handwritten MNIST digits are de-noised, and show that using this kind of
topological prior knowledge in the training of the network significantly
improves the quality of the de-noised digits. Secondly we perform an experiment
in which the task is segmenting the myocardium of the left ventricle from
cardiac magnetic resonance images. We show that the incorporation of the prior
knowledge of the topology of this anatomy improves the resulting segmentations
in terms of both the topological accuracy and the Dice coefficient. Thirdly, we
extend the method to 3D volumes and demonstrate its performance on the task of
segmenting the placenta from ultrasound data, again showing that incorporating
topological priors improves performance on this challenging task. We find that
embedding explicit prior knowledge in neural network segmentation tasks is most
beneficial when the segmentation task is especially challenging and that it can
be used in either a semi-supervised or post-processing context to extract a
useful training gradient from images without pixelwise labels.

exciting propagating surface plasmon polaritons at one end of the nanowire,
remote excitation of the Stokes-shifted whispering gallery modes (WGMs) of the

is studied using Fourier plane optical microscopy, and the polar and azimuthal
emission angles of the antenna are quantified. Interestingly, the thickness of
the silver nanowires is shown to have direct ramifications on the angular
emission pattern, thus providing a design parameter to tune antenna
characteristics. Furthermore, by employing three-dimensional numerical
simulations, electric near-fields of the gap-junction between the microsphere
and the nanowire is mapped, and the modes of nanowire that couple to the
microsphere is identified. This work provides a self-assembled optical antenna
that combines dielectric optical resonances with propagating-plasmons and can
be harnessed in hybrid nonlinear-nanophotonics and single-molecule remote

centers enhances the overall performance of Service Function Chains (SFCs) and
decreases the operational costs for mobile network operators. Maintaining an
optimal placement of VNFs under changing load requires a dynamic
reconfiguration that includes adding or removing VNF instances, changing the
resource allocation of VNFs, and re-routing corresponding service flows.
However, such reconfiguration may lead to notable service disruptions and
impose additional overhead on the VNF infrastructure, especially when
reconfiguration entails state or VNF migration. On the other hand, not changing
the existing placement may lead to high operational costs. In this paper, we
investigate the trade-off between the reconfiguration of SFCs and the
optimality of the resulting placement and service flow (re)routing. We model
different reconfiguration costs related to the migration of stateful VNFs and
solve a joint optimization problem that aims to minimize both the total cost of
the VNF placement and the reconfiguration cost necessary for repairing a
suboptimal placement. Numerical results show that a small number of
reconfiguration operations can significantly reduce the operational cost of the
VNF infrastructure; however, too much reconfiguration may not pay off should
heavy costs be involved.

two hydrophilic stripes is studied experimentally and numerically using direct
numerical simulations. The capillary bridge is formed from an evaporating water
droplet wetting three neighboring stripes of a chemically patterned surface. By
considering the breakup process in a phase space representation, the breakup
dynamics can be evaluated without the uncertainty in determining the precise
breakup time. The simulations are based on the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method
implemented in Free Surface 3D (FS3D). In order to construct physically
realistic initial data for the VOF simulation, Surface Evolver is employed to
calculate an initial configuration consistent with experiments. Numerical
instabilities at the contact line are reduced by a novel discretization of the
Navier-slip boundary condition on staggered grids. The breakup of the capillary
bridge cannot be characterized by a unique scaling relationship. Instead, at
different stages of the breakup process different scaling exponents apply, and
the structure of the bridge undergoes a qualitative change. In the final stage
of breakup, the capillary bridge forms a liquid thread that breaks up
consistently with the Rayleigh-Plateau instability.

  Vancouver, Canada",,,,"cs.LG cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit (NALU) is a neural network layer that can
learn exact arithmetic operations between the elements of a hidden state. The
goal of NALU is to learn perfect extrapolation, which requires learning the
exact underlying logic of an unknown arithmetic problem. Evaluating the
performance of the NALU is non-trivial as one arithmetic problem might have
many solutions. As a consequence, single-instance MSE has been used to evaluate
and compare performance between models. However, it can be hard to interpret
what magnitude of MSE represents a correct solution and models sensitivity to
initialization. We propose using a success-criterion to measure if and when a
model converges. Using a success-criterion we can summarize success-rate over
many initialization seeds and calculate confidence intervals. We contribute a
generalized version of the previous arithmetic benchmark to measure models
sensitivity under different conditions. This is, to our knowledge, the first
extensive evaluation with respect to convergence of the NALU and its sub-units.
Using a success-criterion to summarize 4800 experiments we find that
consistently learning arithmetic extrapolation is challenging, in particular
for multiplication.

secrecy capacity as a function of the total discussion rate is completely
characterized by a polynomial-time computable linear program. Compared to the
existing solution for a particular hypergraphical source model called the
pairwise independent network (PIN) model, the current result is a non-trivial
extension as it applies to a strictly larger class of sources and a more
general scenario involving helpers and wiretapper's side information. In
particular, while the existing solution by tree-packing can be strictly
suboptimal for the PIN model with helpers and the hypergraphical source model
in general, we can show that decremental secret key agreement and linear
network coding is optimal, resolving a previous conjecture in the affirmative.
The converse is established by a single-letter upper bound on the secrecy
capacity for discrete memoryless multiple sources and individual discussion
rate constraints. The minimax optimization involved in the bound can be relaxed
to give the best existing upper bounds on secrecy capacities such as the
lamination bounds for hypergraphical sources, helper-set bound for general

orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation. The scenario is motivated by
vehicular applications where a vehicle equipped with a mono-static radar wishes
to communicate data to its target receiver, while estimating parameters of
interest related to this receiver. In a point-to-point communication setting
over multi-path time-frequency selective channels, we study the joint radar and
communication system from two perspectives, i.e., the radar estimation at the
transmitter as well as the symbol detection at the receiver. For the radar
estimation part, we derive an efficient approximated Maximum Likelihood
algorithm and the corresponding Cram\'er- Rao lower bound for range and
velocity estimation. Numerical examples demonstrate that multi-carrier digital
formats such as OTFS can achieve as accurate radar estimation as
state-of-the-art radar waveforms such as frequency-modulated continuous wave
(FMCW). For the data detection part, we focus on separate detection and
decoding and consider a soft-output detector that exploits efficiently the
channel sparsity in the Doppler-delay domain. We quantify the detector
performance in terms of its pragmatic capacity, i.e. the achievable rate of the
channel induced by the signal constellation and the detector soft output.
Simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms concurrent
state-of-the-art solutions. Overall, our work shows that a suitable digitally
modulated waveform enables to efficiently operate joint radar and communication
by achieving full information rate of the modulation and near-optimal radar
estimation performance. Furthermore, OTFS appears to be particularly suited to
the scope.

operator evaluation on tensor product elements is used to devise a
computationally efficient PDE solver. The multigrid hierarchy exploits all
possibilities of geometric, polynomial, and algebraic coarsening, targeting
engineering applications on complex geometries. Additionally, a transfer from
discontinuous to continuous function spaces is performed within the multigrid
hierarchy. This does not only further reduce the problem size of the
coarse-grid problem, but also leads to a discretization most suitable for
state-of-the-art algebraic multigrid methods applied as coarse-grid solver. The
relevant design choices regarding the selection of optimal multigrid coarsening
strategies among the various possibilities are discussed with the metric of
computational costs as the driving force for algorithmic selections. We find
that a transfer to a continuous function space at highest polynomial degree (or
on the finest mesh), followed by polynomial and geometric coarsening, shows the
best overall performance. The success of this particular multigrid strategy is
due to a significant reduction in iteration counts as compared to a transfer
from discontinuous to continuous function spaces at lowest polynomial degree
(or on the coarsest mesh). The coarsening strategy with transfer to a
continuous function space on the finest level leads to a multigrid algorithm
that is robust with respect to the penalty parameter of the SIPG method.

  Method: We propose a 4D MRI reconstruction method to capture an arbitrary

search regions for fast and robust vessel cross-section tracking. It captures
FOVs of 255 mm x 320 mm x 228 mm at a spatial resolution of 1.82 mm x 1.82 mm x
4mm and temporal resolution of 200ms. A total of 37 4D MRIs of 13 healthy

of the reconstruction rate and speed of both the new and baseline method was
performed. Additionally, a study with ten radiologists was conducted to assess
the subjective reconstruction quality of both methods.
  Results: Our results indicate improved mean reconstruction rates compared to
the baseline method (79.4\% vs. 45.5\%) and improved mean reconstruction times
(24s vs. 73s) per subject. Interventional radiologists perceive the
reconstruction quality of our method as higher compared to the baseline (262.5

  Conclusions: Template updates are an effective and efficient way to increase

Search regions reduce reconstruction time. These improvements increase the

structure including a root node, body-part nodes (e.g. upper body, lower body),
coarse clothes-part nodes (e.g. collar, sleeve) and leaf landmark nodes (e.g.
left-collar, right-collar). Each Layout-Graph Reasoning(LGR) layer aims to map
feature representations into structural graph nodes via a Map-to-Node module,
performs reasoning over structural graph nodes to achieve global layout
coherency via a layout-graph reasoning module, and then maps graph nodes back
to enhance feature representations via a Node-to-Map module. The layout-graph
reasoning module integrates a graph clustering operation to generate
representations of intermediate nodes (bottom-up inference) and then a graph
deconvolution operation (top-down inference) over the whole graph. Extensive
experiments on two public fashion landmark datasets demonstrate the superiority
of our model. Furthermore, to advance the fine-grained fashion landmark
research for supporting more comprehensive clothes generation and attribute
recognition, we contribute the first Fine-grained Fashion Landmark Dataset
(FFLD) containing 200k images annotated with at most 32 key-points for 13
clothes types.

conserved quantity, the third component of the total angular momentum; when it
lies in the orthogonal plane to the symmetry axis, a quantum symmetry arises,
due to the superposition of symmetric states, which has no classical

it, controllability for the classical dynamics and approximate controllability
for the quantum dynamics are proved to hold. The approximate controllability of

word. The first two concepts relate the last visits of states and form
constraints on which states still need to be reached, whereas the third concept
concerns the first visits of states and forms constraints on which states might
still be reached. We examine the computational complexity of different variants
of the problem, whether an automaton can be synchronized with a word that
respects the constraints defined in the respective concept, and obtain nearly a
full classification. While most of the problems are PSPACE-complete we also
observe NP-complete variants and variants solvable in polynomial time. We will
also observe a drop of the complexity if we track the orders of states on
several paths simultaneously instead of tracking the set of active states.
Further, we give upper bounds on the length of a synchronizing word depending

$\mathcal{C}> 0.035$. If the boost is further increased, at very high boosts
$\gamma>1/12\mathcal{C}$, BH formation occurs as predicted by the hoop

solids in general, are rich and complex due to nonlinear mechanics and
nontrivial geometrical effects. While numeric approaches are successful,
analytic tools and conceptual frameworks are largely lacking. Using an analogy
with electrostatics, and building on recent developments in a nonlinear
geometric formulation of elasticity, we develop a formalism that maps the
elastic problem into that of nonlinear interaction of elastic charges. This
approach offers an intuitive conceptual framework, qualitatively explaining the
linear response, the onset of mechanical instability and aspects of the
post-instability state. Apart from intuition, the formalism also quantitatively
reproduces full numeric simulations of several prototypical structures.
Possible applications of the tools developed in this work for the study of

non-stationarity (INS). HHHC is here proposed as a nonlinear vocal source
feature vector that represents the affective states according to their effects
on the speech production mechanism. Emotional states are highlighted by the
empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based method, which exploits the
non-stationarity of the affective acoustic variations. Hurst coefficients
(closely related to the excitation source) are then estimated from the
decomposition process to compose the feature vector. Additionally, the INS
vector is introduced as dynamic information to the HHHC feature. The proposed
features are evaluated in speech emotion classification experiments with three
databases in German and English languages. Three state-of-the-art acoustic
features are adopted as baseline. The $\alpha$-integrated Gaussian model
($\alpha$-GMM) is also introduced for the emotion representation and
classification. Its performance is compared to competing stochastic and machine
learning classifiers. Results demonstrate that HHHC leads to significant
classification improvement when compared to the baseline acoustic features.

also present some drawbacks such as sensitive dependence to prior knowledge, a

propose to incorporate a biased PU risk within the standard GAN discriminator

fluidization of the emulsion proceeds through a sequence of discrete steps,
characterized by yielding events whereby layers of droplets start rolling over
each other, thus leading to sudden drops of the relative effective viscosity.
It is shown that such discrete fluidization is robust against loss of
confinement, namely it persists also in the regime of small ratios of the
droplet diameter over the microchannel width. We also develop a simple
phenomenological model which predicts a linear relation between the relative
effective viscosity of the emulsion and the product of the confinement

Transform Spectrometer (SPIRE FTS) spectroscopy of a sample of twenty massive
Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and
SMC). We analyse the brightest far infrared (far-IR) emission lines, that
diagnose the conditions of the heated gas in the YSO envelope and pinpoint
their physical origin.We compare the properties of massive Magellanic and
Galactic YSOs.We find that [OI] and [CII] emission, that originates from the
photodissociation region associated with the YSOs, is enhanced with respect to
the dust continuum in the Magellanic sample. Furthermore the photoelectric
heating efficiency is systematically higher for Magellanic YSOs, consistent
with reduced grain charge in low metallicity environments. The observed CO
emission is likely due to multiple shock components. The gas temperatures,
derived from the analysis of CO rotational diagrams, are similar to Galactic
estimates. This suggests a common origin to the observed CO excitation, from
low-luminosity to massive YSOs, both in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds.
Bright far-IR line emission provides a mechanism to cool the YSO environment.
We find that, even though [OI], CO and [CII] are the main line coolants, there
is an indication that CO becomes less important at low metallicity, especially
for the SMC sources. This is consistent with a reduction in CO abundance in
environments where the dust is warmer due to reduced ultraviolet-shielding.
Weak H$_2$O and OH emission is detected, consistent with a modest role in the
energy balance of wider massive YSO environments.

This problem consists of simultaneously selecting a subset of orders to be

novel memetic algorithm for this problem, called Sparrow, comprises a
hybridization of biased random key genetic algorithm (BRKGA) and adaptive large
neighbourhood search (ALNS). Sparrow integrates the exploration ability of
BRKGA and the exploitation ability of ALNS. On a set of standard benchmark
instances, this algorithm obtains better-quality solutions with runtimes
comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms. To further understand the strengths
and weaknesses of these algorithms, their performance is also compared on a set
of new benchmark instances with more realistic properties. We conclude that
Sparrow is distinguished by its ability to solve difficult instances from the
OAS literature, and that the hybrid steady-state genetic algorithm (HSSGA)
performs well on large instances in terms of optimality gap, although taking
more time than Sparrow.

allows to utilize acoustic waves with short decay distance and therefore, it
provides a unique possibility to achieve an efficient acousto-optical
modulation at frequencies over several gigahertz, which are unreachable for

fibered CY 3-folds with singular fibers and additional rational sections or
just $N$-sections, in order to study string dualities in four and five
dimensions as well as rigid limits in which gravity decouples. The generating
functions are Jacobi-forms of $\Gamma_1(N)$ with the complexified fiber volume
as modular parameter. The string coupling $\lambda$, or the $\epsilon_\pm$
parameters in the rigid limit, as well as the masses of charged hypermultiplets
and non-Abelian gauge bosons are elliptic parameters. To understand this
structure, we show that specific auto-equivalences act on the category of
topological B-branes on these geometries and generate an action of
$\Gamma_1(N)$ on the stringy K\""ahler moduli space. We argue that these actions
can always be expressed in terms of the generic Seidel-Thomas twist with
respect to the 6-brane together with shifts of the B-field and are thus
monodromies. This implies the elliptic transformation law that is satisfied by
the generating functions. We use Higgs transitions in F-theory to extend the
ansatz for the modular bootstrap to genus one fibrations with $N$-sections and
boundary conditions fix the all genus generating functions for small base
degrees completely. This allows us to study in depth a wide range of new,
non-perturbative theories, which are Type II theory duals to the CHL
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifolds of the heterotic string on $K3\times T_2$. In
particular, we compare the BPS degeneracies in the large base limit to the

Learning yields suboptimal results if the local clients' data distributions
diverge. To address this issue, we present Clustered Federated Learning (CFL),
a novel Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL) framework, which exploits
geometric properties of the FL loss surface, to group the client population
into clusters with jointly trainable data distributions. In contrast to
existing FMTL approaches, CFL does not require any modifications to the FL
communication protocol to be made, is applicable to general non-convex
objectives (in particular deep neural networks) and comes with strong
mathematical guarantees on the clustering quality. CFL is flexible enough to
handle client populations that vary over time and can be implemented in a
privacy preserving way. As clustering is only performed after Federated
Learning has converged to a stationary point, CFL can be viewed as a
post-processing method that will always achieve greater or equal performance
than conventional FL by allowing clients to arrive at more specialized models.
We verify our theoretical analysis in experiments with deep convolutional and
recurrent neural networks on commonly used Federated Learning datasets.

Localization and Mapping. The surface to be estimated is represented as a
piecewise planar surface, defined as a group of surfels each having as
parameters its position and normal. These parameters are then directly
estimated from the raw camera pixels measurements, by a Gauss-Newton iterative
process. As far as the authors know, this is the first time this approach is
used for monocular depth estimation. The representation of the surface as a
group of surfels has several advantages. It allows the recovery of robust and
accurate pixel depths, without the need to use a computationally demanding
depth regularization schema. This has the further advantage of avoiding the use
of a physically unlikely surface smoothness prior. New surfels can be correctly
initialized from the information present in nearby surfels, avoiding also the
need to use an expensive initialization routine commonly needed in Gauss-Newton
methods. The method was written in the GLSL shading language, allowing the
usage of GPGPU thus achieving real-time. The method was tested against several

the study of networks to the analysis of snapshots in time. This approach has
been used for verification of network evolution mechanisms, such as
preferential attachment. However, these studies are mostly restricted to the
analysis of the first links established by a new node in the network and
typically ignore connections made after each node's initial introduction. Here,
we show that the subsequent actions of individuals, such as their second
network link, are not random and can be decoupled from the mechanism behind the
first network link. We show that this feature has strong influence on the
network topology. Moreover, snapshots in time can now provide information on
the mechanism used to establish the second connection. We interpret these
empirical results by introducing the propinquity model, in which we control and
vary the distance of the second link established by a new node, and find that
this can lead to networks with tunable density scaling, as found in real
networks. Our work shows that sociologically meaningful mechanisms are
influencing network evolution and provides indications of the importance of
measuring the distance between successive connections.

Political trolls, such as the ones linked to the Russian Internet Research
Agency (IRA), have recently gained enormous attention for their ability to sway
public opinion and even influence elections. Analysis of the online traces of
trolls has shown different behavioral patterns, which target different slices
of the population. However, this analysis is manual and labor-intensive, thus
making it impractical as a first-response tool for newly-discovered troll
farms. In this paper, we show how to automate this analysis by using machine
learning in a realistic setting. In particular, we show how to classify trolls
according to their political role ---left, news feed, right--- by using
features extracted from social media, i.e., Twitter, in two scenarios: (i) in a
traditional supervised learning scenario, where labels for trolls are
available, and (ii) in a distant supervision scenario, where labels for trolls
are not available, and we rely on more-commonly-available labels for news
outlets mentioned by the trolls. Technically, we leverage the community
structure and the text of the messages in the online social network of trolls
represented as a graph, from which we extract several types of learned
representations, i.e.,~embeddings, for the trolls. Experiments on the ""IRA

state-of-the-art in the first scenario, while providing a compelling case for
the second scenario, which has not been explored in the literature thus far.

describe the spatial scan monitor pipeline and present results derived from
eight years of transiting exoplanet data. Our goal is to monitor the quality of
the data and make recommendations to users that will enhance future
observations. We find that a typical observation achieves a white light curve
precision that is $1.07\times$ the photon-limit (which is slightly better than
expectations) and that the pointing drift is relatively stable during times of
normal telescope operations. We note that observations cannot achieve the
optimal precision when the drift along the dispersion direction ($X$ axis)
exceeds 15 mas ($\sim$0.11 pixels). Based on our sample, 77.1% of observations
are ''successful'' ($<15$ mas rms drift), 12.0% are ''marginal'' (15 -- 135
mas), and 10.8% of observations have ''failed'' ($>135$ mas or $>1$ pixel),
meaning they do not achieve the necessary pointing stability to achieve the
optimal spectroscopic precision. In comparing the observed versus calculated
maximum pixel fluence, we find that the J band is a better predictor of fluence
than the H band. Using this information, we derive an updated, empirical
relation for scan rate that also accounts for the J-H color of the host star.
We implement this relation and other improvements in version 1.4 of PandExo and
version 0.5 of ExoCTK. Finally, we make recommendations on how to plan future

systematics (in the form of a ramp or hook) that have been attributed to the
effects of persistence. The amplitude of these systematics is often two orders
of magnitude larger than the signal sizes of interest and, therefore, must be
carefully modelled and removed. The goal of this calibration program
(CAL-15400) is to mitigate these systematics by continuously illuminating the
detector while repeatedly reading it out during Earth occultation (termed
pre-flashing). Compared to standard observations, we are able to reduce the
amplitude of the systematic effect by a factor of $\sim$7 (from 1.30% to
-0.19%), thus confirming our hypothesis that the detector more quickly reaches
an equilibrium state when subjected to higher flux levels. Compared to the
latest modeling techniques (Zhou et al., 2017), we achieve a marginal
improvement in the white light curve precision ($\Delta$rms = -8{\pm}9 ppm);
therefore, pre-flashing is an equally effective means to mitigate WFC3's
instrument systematics. We conclude that pre-flashing does not warrant future
consideration due to the increase in the number of channel select mechanism
(CSM) motions, effort required to implement, and equivalent ability to model
instrument systematics with current techniques.

particular language typically implies trade offs between conflicting design
goals such as performance, costs, and overheads. The large variety of

trade off space, ranging from minimalistic to rich full-fledged approaches, but
once a choice is made it is often difficult for the designer to revise it. In

method to flexibly reshape the target programming language as needed, adding
only those application layer features that match the current design goals. In
so doing complexity is made transparent, but not hidden: While the programmer
can benefit of higher level constructs, the designer can deal with modular

statistics. Primarily, thanks to the additive structure of the model, it can be
achieved without difficulty to estimate parameters including mean. However,
tight conditions on cumulant function, such as analyticity, strict convexity,
and steepness, reduce the class of exponential dispersion model. In this work,
we present relaxed exponential dispersion model K-LED (Legendre exponential
dispersion model with K cumulants). The cumulant function of the proposed model
is a convex function of Legendre type having continuous partial derivatives of
K-th order on the interior of a convex domain. Most of the K-LED models are
developed via Bregman-divergence-guided log-concave density function with
coercivity shape constraints. The main advantage of the proposed model is that
the first cumulant (or the mean parameter space) of the 1-LED model is easily
computed through the extended global optimum property of Bregman divergence. An
extended normal distribution is introduced as an example of 1-LED based on
Tweedie distribution. On top of that, we present 2-LED satisfying mean-variance
relation of quasi-likelihood function. There is an equivalence between a
subclass of quasi-likelihood function and a regular 2-LED model, of which the
canonical parameter space is open. A typical example is a regular 2-LED model
with power variance function, i.e., a variance is in proportion to the power of
the mean of observations. This model is equivalent to a subclass of
beta-divergence (or a subclass of quasi-likelihood function with power variance
function). Furthermore, a new parameterized K-LED model, the cumulant function
of which is the convex extended logistic loss function, is proposed. This model

penalized likelihood metric, where the penalty is determined by the criterion
adopted. While rules for choosing a penalty that guarantees a consistent
estimate of the model order are known, theoretical tools for its design with
finite samples have never been provided in a general setting. In this paper, we
study model order selection for finite samples under a design perspective,
focusing on the generalized information criterion (GIC), which embraces the
most common ITC. The theory is general, and as case studies we consider: a) the
problem of estimating the number of signals embedded in additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN) by using multiple sensors; b) model selection for the general
linear model (GLM), which includes e.g. the problem of estimating the number of
sinusoids in AWGN. The analysis reveals a trade-off between the probabilities
of overestimating and underestimating the order of the model. We then propose
to design the GIC penalty to minimize underestimation while keeping the
overestimation probability below a specified level. For the considered
problems, this method leads to analytical derivation of the optimal penalty for
a given sample size. A performance comparison between the penalty optimized GIC
and common AIC and BIC is provided, demonstrating the effectiveness of the

Here we provide a comprehensive convergence analysis of the IEnKF and propose a
new method to improve its convergence. A theoretical analysis of the standard
IEnKF is presented and we demonstrate that the interaction between the
nonlinearity of the forward model and the diminishing effect of the Kalman
updates results in ""early stopping"" of the IEnKF, i.e. the Kalman operator
converges to zero before the innovation is minimized. The steady state behavior
of the early stopping phenomenon and its relation to observation uncertainty is
demonstrate. We then propose an approach to prevent the early stopping by
perturbing the covariance with hidden parameter ensemble resampling. The
ensemble mean and covariance are kept unchanged during the resampling process,
which ensures the Kalman operator at each iteration maintains a correct update
direction. We briefly discuss the influence higher moments, such as kurtosis,
of the resampling distribution on algorithm convergence. Parallel to the above
developments, an example problem is presented to demonstrate the early stopping

microwave resonator, a microwave billiard, with partially violated
time-reversal (T ) invariance, induced by inserting a ferrite into the cavity
and magnetizing it with an external magnetic field perpendicular to the
resonator plane. In order to prevent its expulsion caused by the
Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect we used a cavity of which the top and bottom plate
were made from niobium, a superconductor of type II, and cooled it down to
liquid-helium temperature T LHe ' 4 K. The Cavity had the shape of a chaotic
Afrivca billiard. Superconductivity rendered possible the accurate
determination of complete sequences of the resonance frequencies and of the
widths and strengths of the resonances, an indispensable prerequisite for the
unambiguous detection of T invariance violation, especially when it is only
partially violated. This allows for the first time the precise specification of
the size of T invariance violation from the fluctuation properties of the
resonance frequencies and from the strength distribution, which actually
depends sensitively on it and thus provides a most suitable measure. For this
purpose we derived an analytical expression for the latter which is valid for
isolated resonances in the range from no T invariance violation to complete
violation.

  https://codingbyexample.com/2019/10/02/predictive-simulation/",,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Current virtual reality systems are typically limited by performance/cost,
usability (size), or a combination of both. By using a networked client/server
environment, we have solved these limitations for the client. However, in doing
so we have introduced a new problem, namely increased latency. Interactive
networked virtual environments such as games and simulations have existed for
nearly as long as the Internet and have consistently faced latency issues. We
propose a solution for negating the effects of latency for interactive
networked virtual environments with lightweight clients, with respect to the
server being used. The proposed method extrapolates future client states to be
incorporated in the server's updates, which helps to synchronize actions on the
client-side and the results coming from the server. We refer to this approach
as predictive simulation. In addition to describing our method, in this paper,
we look at extrapolation methods because the success of our predictive
simulation method is dependent on strong predictions. We focus on regression
methods and briefly examine the use of artificial neural networks.

often lead to longer time to convergence or time to train (TTT), and in some
cases, lower model accuracy. CPUs, on the other hand, can leverage significant
amounts of memory. While much work has been done on parallelizing neural
network training on multiple CPUs, little attention has been given to tune
neural network training with large images on CPUs. In this work, we train a
multi-scale convolutional neural network (M-CNN) to classify large biomedical
images for high content screening in one hour. The ability to leverage large
memory capacity on CPUs enables us to scale to larger batch sizes without
having to crop or down-sample the input images. In conjunction with large batch
sizes, we find a generalized methodology of linearly scaling of learning rate

banners, signboards, billboards, homepages, and mobile apps. Designers are
tasked with drawing contours, whereas our system colorizes contours in
different styles. This goal is achieved by training a dual conditional
generative adversarial network (GAN) on our collected icon dataset. One
condition requires the generated image and the drawn contour to possess a
similar contour, while the other anticipates the image and the referenced icon
to be similar in color style. Accordingly, the generator takes a contour image
and a man-made icon image to colorize the contour, and then the discriminators
determine whether the result fulfills the two conditions. The trained network
is able to colorize icons demanded by designers and greatly reduces their
workload. For the evaluation, we compared our dual conditional GAN to several
state-of-the-art techniques. Experiment results demonstrate that our network is
over the previous networks. Finally, we will provide the source code, icon
dataset, and trained network for public use.

  Computing","Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, Sept 2019",,,,"cs.NI cs.CV cs.DC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As a key technology of enabling Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in
5G era, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have quickly attracted widespread
attention. However, it is challenging to run computation-intensive DNN-based
tasks on mobile devices due to the limited computation resources. What's worse,
traditional cloud-assisted DNN inference is heavily hindered by the significant
wide-area network latency, leading to poor real-time performance as well as low
quality of user experience. To address these challenges, in this paper, we
propose Edgent, a framework that leverages edge computing for DNN collaborative
inference through device-edge synergy. Edgent exploits two design knobs: (1)
DNN partitioning that adaptively partitions computation between device and edge
for purpose of coordinating the powerful cloud resource and the proximal edge
resource for real-time DNN inference; (2) DNN right-sizing that further reduces
computing latency via early exiting inference at an appropriate intermediate
DNN layer. In addition, considering the potential network fluctuation in
real-world deployment, Edgentis properly design to specialize for both static
and dynamic network environment. Specifically, in a static environment where
the bandwidth changes slowly, Edgent derives the best configurations with the
assist of regression-based prediction models, while in a dynamic environment
where the bandwidth varies dramatically, Edgent generates the best execution
plan through the online change point detection algorithm that maps the current
bandwidth state to the optimal configuration. We implement Edgent prototype
based on the Raspberry Pi and the desktop PC and the extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate Edgent's effectiveness in enabling on-demand
low-latency edge intelligence.

(called ""PPR""): a popular technique that samples a small community from a
massive network. We study a setting where the entire network is expensive to
obtain thoroughly or to maintain, but we can start from a seed node of interest
and ""crawl"" the network to find other nodes through their connections. By
crawling the graph in a designed way, the PPR vector can be approximated
without querying the entire massive graph, making it an alternative to snowball
sampling. Using the degree-corrected stochastic block model, we study whether
the PPR vector can select nodes that belong to the same block as the seed node.
We provide a simple and interpretable form for the PPR vector, highlighting its
biases towards high degree nodes outside the target block. We examine a simple
adjustment based on node degrees and establish consistency results for PPR
clustering that allows for directed graphs. These results are enabled by recent
technical advances showing the elementwise convergence of eigenvectors. We
illustrate the method with the massive Twitter friendship graph, which we crawl
by using the Twitter application programming interface. We find that the
adjusted and unadjusted PPR techniques are complementary approaches, where the
adjustment makes the results particularly localized around the seed node, and
that the bias adjustment greatly benefits from degree regularization.
