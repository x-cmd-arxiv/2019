anomaly, aiming to resolve the greater than 3$\sigma$ discrepancy between the
previous measurement and the Standard Model calculation with an improved
precision of 140 part-per-billion (ppb). In E989, the muon beam is stored in a
ring magnet. The spin precession frequency $\omega_{a}$ is measured by counting
the decay positrons in 24 calorimeters, and the magnetic field is measured by
nuclear magnet resonance (NMR) probes. An in-vacuum field scanning system
consisting of NMR probes and read-out electronics has been implemented to
measure the magnetic field applied to the muon beam. An additional 378 NMR
probes, placed at fixed locations outside the vacuum chamber, monitor the field
drift in between field scans. A high-accuracy probe was designed for
calibrating the probes in the scanner. In this presentation, the magnetic field
measurement hardware system and analysis methods will be described in detail.
The progress of the Run-1 data analysis and improvements in Run-2 will be
presented as well.

complex signaling mechanisms such as quorum sensing and chemotaxis. The
biological diversity is enormous, but synthetic inanimate colloidal
microswimmers mimic microbiological communication (synthetic chemotaxis) and
may be used to explore collective behaviour beyond the one-species limit in
simpler setups. In this work we combine particle based and continuum
simulations as well as linear stability analyses, and study a physical minimal
model of two chemotactic species. We observed a rich phase diagram comprising a
""hunting swarm phase"", where both species self-segregate and form swarms,
pursuing, or hunting each other, and a ""core-shell-cluster phase"", where one
species forms a dense cluster, which is surrounded by a (fluctuating) corona of
particles from the other species. Once formed, these clusters can dynamically
turn inside out, representing a ""species-reversal"". These results exemplify a
physical route to collective behaviours in microorganisms and active colloids,
which are so-far known to occur only for comparatively large and complex

effectiveness of our approach and its scalability to dimensions that prohibit

data are receiving a growing interest from the remote sensing community.
However, a misaligned integration between these datasets may fail to fully
profit the potential of both sensors. In this regard, an optimum fusion of
optical imagery and LiDAR data requires an accurate registration. This is a
complex problem since a versatile solution is still missing, especially when
considering the context where data are collected at different times, from
different platforms, under different acquisition configurations. This paper
presents a coarse-to-fine registration method of aerial/satellite optical
imagery with airborne LiDAR data acquired in such context. Firstly, a coarse
registration involves extracting and matching of buildings from LiDAR data and
optical imagery. Then, a Mutual Information-based fine registration is carried
out. It involves a super-resolution approach applied to LiDAR data, and a local
approach of transformation model estimation. The proposed method succeeds at
overcoming the challenges associated with the aforementioned difficult context.
Considering the experimented airborne LiDAR (2011) and orthorectified aerial
imagery (2016) datasets, their spatial shift is reduced by 48.15% after the
proposed coarse registration. Moreover, the incompatibility of size and spatial
resolution is addressed by the mentioned super-resolution. Finally, a high
accuracy of dataset alignment is also achieved, highlighted by a 40-cm error
based on a check-point assessment and a 64-cm error based on a check-pair-line
assessment. These promising results enable further research for a complete
versatile fusion methodology between airborne LiDAR and optical imagery data in
this challenging context.

interference with regard to a particular class of states, so-called quantum

insensitive to the relative phase between different comb line pairs. This is
true even when different comb line pairs are mutually coherent at the input of

purpose cache manager decisions. Cache managers directly impact the overall
performance of computer systems. They govern decisions about which objects
should be cached, the duration they should be cached for, and decides on which
objects to evict from the cache if it is full. These three decisions impact
both the cache hit rate and size of the storage that is needed to achieve that
cache hit rate. An optimal cache manager will avoid unnecessary operations,
maximise the cache hit rate which results in fewer round trips to a slower
backend storage system, and minimise the size of storage needed to achieve a
high hit-rate.
  This project investigates using reinforcement learning in cache management by
designing three separate agents for each of the cache manager tasks.
Furthermore, the project investigates two advanced reinforcement learning
architectures for multi-decision problems: a single multi-task agent and a
multi-agent. We also introduce a framework to simplify the modelling of
computer systems problems as a reinforcement learning task. The framework
abstracts delayed experiences observations and reward assignment in computer
systems while providing a flexible way to scale to multiple agents.
  Simulation results based on an established database benchmark system show
that reinforcement learning agents can achieve a higher cache hit rate over
heuristic driven algorithms while minimising the needed space. They are also
able to adapt to a changing workload and dynamically adjust their caching
strategy accordingly. The proposed cache manager model is generic and
applicable to other types of caches, such as file system caches. This project
is the first, to our knowledge, to model cache manager decisions as a
multi-task control problem.

of requests $\{(s_1, t_1), \ldots, (s_k, t_k)\}$, and the task is to find a
collection of pairwise vertex-disjoint paths $\{P_1, \ldots, P_k\}$ such that
each $P_i$ is a path from $s_i$ to $t_i$ in $D$. This problem is NP-complete
for fixed $k=2$ and W[1]-hard with parameter $k$ in DAGs. A few positive
results are known under restrictions on the input digraph, such as being planar
or having bounded directed tree-width, or under relaxations of the problem,
such as allowing for vertex congestion. Positive results are scarce, however,
for general digraphs. In this article we propose a novel global congestion
metric for the problem: we only require the paths to be ""disjoint enough"", in
the sense that they must behave properly not in the whole graph, but in an
unspecified part of size prescribed by a parameter. Namely, in the Disjoint
Enough Directed Paths problem, given an $n$-vertex digraph $D$, a set of $k$
requests, and non-negative integers $d$ and $s$, the task is to find a
collection of paths connecting the requests such that at least $d$ vertices of
$D$ occur in at most $s$ paths of the collection. We study the parameterized
complexity of this problem for a number of choices of the parameter, including
the directed tree-width of $D$. Among other results, we show that the problem
is W[1]-hard in DAGs with parameter $d$ and, on the positive side, we give an
algorithm in time $\mathcal{O}(n^{d+2} \cdot k^{d\cdot s})$ and a kernel of
size $d \cdot 2^{k-s}\cdot \binom{k}{s} + 2k$ in general digraphs. This latter
result has consequences for the Steiner Network problem: we show that it is FPT
parameterized by the number $k$ of terminals and $p$, where $p = n - q$ and $q$
is the size of the solution.

observations acquired during 2018. A system of polar storms that appeared in
the planet in March 2018 and remained active with a complex phenomenology at
least until Sept. is analyzed elsewhere (Sanchez-Lavega et al., in press ,
2019). Many of the cloud features in 2018 are long-lived and can be identified
in images in 2017, and in some cases, for up to a decade using also Cassini ISS
images. Without considering the polar storms, the most interesting long-lived
cloud systems are: i) A bright spot in the EZ that can be tracked continuously
since 2014 with a zonal velocity of 444 m/s in 2014 and 452 m/s in 2018. This
velocity is different from the zonal winds at the cloud level at its latitude
during the Cassini mission, and is closer to zonal winds obtained at the time
of the Voyager flybys and zonal winds from Cassini VIMS infrared images of the
lower atmosphere. ii) A large Anticyclone Vortex, here AV, that formed after
the GWS of 2010-2011. This vortex has changed significantly in visual contrast,
drift rate and latitude with minor changes in size over the last years. iii) A
system of subpolar vortices present at least since 2011. These vortices follow
drift rates consistent with zonal winds obtained by Cassini. We also present
the positions of the vertices of the North polar hexagon from 2015 to 2018
compared with previous analyses during Cassini (2007-2014), observations with
HST, and Voyager data in 1980-1981 to explore the long-term hexagon's drift
rate. Variations in the drift rate cannot be fit by seasonal changes. Instead,
the different drift rates reinforce the role of the North Polar Spot that was
present in the Voyager epoch to cause a faster drift rate of the hexagon at
that time compared with the current one.

state spin -- or pseudospin -- expectation value textures in the Brillouin
zone, the chiral and helical topological skyrmion phases of matter. These
phases are protected by a symmetry present in centrosymmetric superconductors.
We consider a tight-binding model for spin-triplet superconductivity in
transition metal oxides and find it realizes each of these topological skyrmion
phases. The chiral phase is furthermore realized for a parameter set
characterizing Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ with spin-triplet superconductivity. We also find
two types of topological phase transitions by which the skyrmion number can
change. The second type occurs without the closing of energy gaps in a system
described by a quadratic Hamiltonian without breaking the protecting symmetries
when atomic spin-orbit coupling is non-negligible and there is a suitable
additional degree of freedom. This contradicts the ``flat band'' limit
assumption important in use of entanglement spectrum and Wilson loops, and in
construction of the ten-fold way classification scheme of topological phases of
matter. We furthermore predict two kinds of bulk-boundary correspondence
signatures -- one for measurements which execute a partial trace over degrees
of freedom other than spin, which yields quantized transport signatures -- and
a second resulting from skyrmions trapping defects with their own non-trivial
topology that is discussed in a second work, which yields generalizations of
unpaired Majorana zero-modes.

intermediate-gravity sources lacking bonafide membership in a moving group with
higher tangential and UVW velocities. We conclude that TRAPPIST-1 is a
field-age source with subtle spectral features reminiscent of a low surface

signal? This chapter focusses on the inference of the interesting astrophysics
and cosmology once we obtain a detection of the 21-cm signal.
  Essentially, inference of the astrophysics can be broken down into three
parts:
  1. Characterisation of the observed data: The observed 21-cm signal varies
spatially as well as along the line-of-sight (frequency or redshift dimension)
to provide a full three dimensional movie of the intergalactic medium in the
early Universe. However, we cannot perform a full pixel-by-pixel comparison
between theoretical models and the observed signal. Instead, we require a
variety of statistical methods to average the observational data in order to be
able to better characterise and compare the behaviour of the faint signal.
  2. An efficient method to model the 21-cm signal: In order to interpret the
observations and understand the astrophysical processes responsible, we must be
able to produce physically motivated models capable of replicating the signal.
Further, these must be as computationally efficient as possible in order to be
able to realistically investigate the 21-cm signal.
  3. A robust probabilistic framework to extract the physics: The observed
21-cm signal is dependent on numerous physical processes, which within our
models or simulations are described by many unknown parameters. Further, these
contain approximations in order to deal with the requisite dynamic range. We
must be able to characterise our ignorance in a meaningful way in order to be
truly able to infer the astrophysical processes of the epoch of reionisation
and cosmic dawn.
  In this chapter we will focus on each separately, discussing the current
state-of-the-art in inferring astrophysical and cosmological information from
the 21cm signal.

attempt of Daniel Simson to construct a counterexample to the pure
semisimplicity conjecture. Using compactness, we show that the existence of
such counterexample would readily follow from the very existence of certain
(countable set of) hereditary artinian rings of finite representation type.
  The existence of such rings is then proved to be equivalent to the existence
of special types of embeddings, which we call tight, of division rings into
simple artinian rings. Using the tools by Aidan Schofield from 1980s, we can
show that such an embedding $F\hookrightarrow M_n(G)$ exists provided that
$n<5$. As a byproduct, we obtain a division ring extension $G\subseteq F$ such
that the bimodule ${}_GF_F$ has the right dimension sequence $(1,2,2,2,1,4)$.
  Finally, we formulate Conjecture A, which asserts that a particular type of
adjunction of an element to a division ring can be made, and demonstrate that
its validity would be sufficient to prove the existence of tight embeddings in
general, and hence to disprove the pure semisimplicity conjecture.

of Cross-Subspace Alignment (CSA) which was introduced originally in the

Cauchy-Vandermonde matrix structure that facilitates interference alignment
along Vandermonde terms, while the desired computations remain resolvable along
the Cauchy terms. These codes unify, generalize and improve upon the
state-of-art codes for distributed computing. First we introduce CSA codes for
matrix multiplication, which yield LCC codes as a special case, and are shown
to outperform LCC codes in general over strictly download-limited settings.
Next, we introduce Generalized CSA (GCSA) codes for matrix multiplication that
bridge the extremes of matrix-partitioning and batch processing approaches.
Finally, we introduce $N$-CSA codes for $N$-linear distributed batch
computations and multivariate batch polynomial evaluations. $N$-CSA codes
include LCC codes as a special case, and are in general capable of achieving
significantly lower downloads than LCC codes due to cross-subspace alignment.
Generalizations of $N$-CSA codes to include $X$-secure data and $B$-byzantine

Interactive characters in such fields are becoming driven by AI which opens up
the possibility of non-linear and open-ended narratives that may even include

ERIK, an expressive inverse kinematics technique aimed at such applications.
Our technique allows an arbitrary kinematic chain, such as an arm, snake, or
robotic manipulator, to exhibit an expressive posture while aiming its
end-point towards a given target orientation. The technique runs in
interactive-time and does not require any pre-processing step such as e.g.
training in machine learning techniques, in order to support new embodiments or
new postures. That allows it to be integrated in an artist-friendly workflow,
bringing artists closer to the development of such AI-driven expressive
characters, by allowing them to use their typical animation tools of choice,
and to properly pre-visualize the animation during design-time, even on a real
robot. The full algorithmic specification is presented and described so that it
can be implemented and used throughout the communities of the various fields we
address. We demonstrate ERIK on different virtual kinematic structures, and
also on a low-fidelity robot that was crafted using wood and hobby-grade
servos, to show how well the technique performs even on a low-grade robot. Our
evaluation shows how well the technique performs, i.e., how well the character
is able to point at the target orientation, while minimally disrupting its
target expressive posture, and respecting its mechanical rotation limits.

exploits experimental physical noise as a resource to speed up the ground state

allowing one to probe noise-dependent physical observables. Since the recurrent
photonic transformation that our machine imparts is a fixed function of the

of astronomical sources in unprecedented detail by providing an order of
magnitude improvement in sensitivity and angular resolution compared with radio
interferometers currently operating at 1.2--116~GHz. However, the current ngVLA
array design results in a highly non-Gaussian dirty beam that may make it
difficult to achieve high-fidelity images with both maximum sensitivity and
maximum angular resolution using traditional CLEAN deconvolution methods. This
challenge may be overcome with regularized maximum-likelihood (RML) methods, a
new class of imaging techniques developed for the Event Horizon Telescope. RML
methods take a forward-modeling approach, directly solving for the images
without using either the dirty beam or the dirty map. Consequently, this method
has the potential to improve the fidelity and effective angular resolution of
images produced by the ngVLA. As an illustrative case, we present ngVLA imaging
simulations of stellar radio photospheres performed with both multi-scale (MS-)
CLEAN and RML methods implemented in the CASA and SMILI packages, respectively.
We find that both MS-CLEAN and RML methods can provide high-fidelity images
recovering most of the representative structures for different types of stellar
photosphere models. However, RML methods show better performance than MS-CLEAN
for various stellar models in terms of goodness-of-fit to the data, residual
errors of the images, and in recovering representative features in the ground
truth images. Our simulations support the feasibility of transformative stellar
imaging science with the ngVLA, and simultaneously demonstrate that RML methods
are an attractive choice for ngVLA imaging.

(smaller halos within the smooth lens) or line-of-sight (LOS) halos. We present
results attempting to infer the presence of substructure from images without
requiring an intermediate step in which a smooth model has to be subtracted,
using a simple convolutional neural network (CNN). We find that the network is
only able to infer the presence of subhalos with $>75\%$ accuracy when they
have masses of $\geq 5 \times 10^9$M$_{\odot}$ if they lie within the main lens

higher mass subhalos, the CNN can probe lower masses in the halo mass function.
The accuracy does not improve significantly if we add a population of less

yielding thousands of high-quality strong lensing images in the next years,
having a way of analyzing images quickly to identify candidates that merit
further analysis to determine individual subhalo properties while preventing
extensive resources being used for images that would yield null detections

substructure mass, non-detections could be combined with the information from
images with substructure to constrain the cold dark matter scenario, in
particular if the sensitivity can be pushed to lower masses.

for gravitational wave interferometers operating in the decihertz band.
Moreover, according to the double degenerate scenario, they have been suggested
to be possible progenitors of supernovae (SNe) Type Ia events. In this paper we
discuss the detectability of gravitational waves emitted by the inspiral of
double white dwarfs. We focus on the constraints that can be derived on the
source's luminosity distance, and on other binary's parameters, such as the
angular momentum orientation. We explore the possibility of coincident
detections of gravitational and electromagnetic signals; the latter comes from
the observation of the supernova counterpart. Confirmation of the double
degenerate scenario would allow one to use distances inferred in the
gravitational wave channel to consistently calibrate SNe as standard candles.
We find that decihertz gravitational wave interferometers can measure the
luminosity distance with relative accuracy better than $1\%$ for binaries at
100 Mpc. We show how multimessenger observations can put strong constraints on
the Hubble constant, which are tighter than current bounds at low redshift, and
how they can potentially shed new light on the differences with early-universe

an offset from the observations for the $M_{BH}-\sigma$ relation, and the

For massive galaxies in both simulations, the hosts of over-massive SMBHs
(those above the mean $M_{BH}-\sigma$ relation) tend to have larger Sersic
indices and lower baryon conversion efficiency, suggesting a multidimensional
link between SMBHs and properties of their hosts. In Illustris, the hosts of
over-massive SMBHs have formed earlier and have lower present-day star
formation rates, in qualitative agreement with the observations for massive
galaxies with $\sigma>100 \rm km/s$. For low-mass galaxies, such a correlation
still holds in Illustris but does not exist in the observed data. For TNG100,
the correlation between SMBH over-massiveness and star formation history is
much weaker. The hosts of over-massive SMBHs generally have consistently larger
star formation rates throughout history. These galaxies have higher stellar
mass as well, due to the strong $M_{BH}-M_*$ correlation. Our findings show
that simulated SMBH scaling relations and correlations are sensitive to
features in the modeling of SMBHs.

the collision integral, we show quantitatively that the full kinetic theory

generalised fluxes describing such a background. The construction extends to
backgrounds for which there is no Lagrangian description -- namely magnetically
charged backgrounds or those violating the strong constraint of double field
theory -- at the cost of violating the Jacobi identity of the current algebra.
  The known non-commutative and non-associative interpretation of non-geometric
flux backgrounds is reproduced by means of the deformed current algebra.
Furthermore, the provided framework is used to suggest a generalisation of
Poisson-Lie $T$-duality to generic models with constant generalised fluxes. As
a side note, the relation between Lie and Courant algebroid structures of the
string current algebra is clarified.

provide mislabeled poisoning data that is possible to identify by visual

We perform an extensive study on various image classification settings and show
that our attack can fool the model by pasting the trigger at random locations

dynamic SSE, where data might be updated. It has been proven that to avoid this

dynamic SSE scheme is said to be forward private, if adding a keyword-document

  In SSE setting, the data owner has very low computation and storage power. In
this setting, though some schemes achieve forward privacy with
honest-but-curious cloud, it becomes difficult to achieve forward privacy when
the server is malicious, meaning that it can alter the data. Verifiable dynamic
SSE requires the server to give a proof of the result of the search query. The

for a class of problems, we introduce a novel mechanism that privatizes vectors
belonging to the unit simplex. Such vectors can be seen in many applications,
such as privatizing a decision-making policy in a Markov decision process. We
use differential privacy as the underlying mathematical framework for these
developments. The introduced mechanism is a probabilistic mapping that maps a
vector within the unit simplex to the same domain according to a Dirichlet
distribution. We find the mechanism well-suited for inputs within the unit
simplex because it always returns a privatized output that is also in the unit
simplex. Therefore, no further projection back onto the unit simplex is
required. We verify the privacy guarantees of the mechanism for two cases,
namely, identity queries and average queries. In the former case, we derive
expressions for the differential privacy level of privatizing a single vector
within the unit simplex. In the latter case, we study the mechanism for
privatizing the average of a collection of vectors, each of which is in the
unit simplex. We establish a trade-off between the strength of privacy and the
variance of the mechanism output, and we introduce a parameter to balance the
trade-off between them. Numerical results illustrate these developments.

contains an extra -1/2 term. The origin of this -1/2 term is explained using a
spectral density approach. To be explicit, a delta-function potential is used
to show that the correction term arises from a pole of the density of states at
zero energy. The spectral density method shows that this term is actually an
artifact of the non-normalizability of the scattering states and an infrared
cutoff regularization scheme has to be used to get the correct result in 1D.
The formal derivation of the BU formula would miss this term since it ignores
the effects of the boundary terms. While the result is shown for the
delta-function potential, the method and result are valid for more general
potentials. Additionally, the 1D Levinson's theorem can be extracted from the
spectral density method using the asymptotic form of general potentials. The
importance of the result lies in the fact that all these correction terms in 1D
have a universal source: a pole at zero energy. Similar calculations using
quantum field theoretical approaches (without explicit infrared cutoff
regularization schemes) also show the same subtleties with the correction term

for novel expansion solutions to today's charging networks. Riding on the wave
of the proliferation of sharing economy, Airbnb-like charger sharing markets
opens the opportunity to expand the existing charging networks without
requiring costly and time-consuming infrastructure investments, yet the
successful design of such markets relies on innovations at the interface
between game theory, mechanism design, and large scale optimization. In this
paper, we propose a price-based iterative double auction for charger sharing
markets where charger owners rent out their under-utilized chargers to the
charge-needing EV drivers. Charger owners and EV drivers form a two-sided
market which is cleared by a price-based double auction. Chargers' locations,
availability, and time unit costs as well as the EV drivers' time, distance
constraints, and preferences are considered in the allocation and scheduling
process. The goal is to compute social welfare maximizing allocations which
benefits both charger owners and EV drivers and, in turn, ensure the continuous
growth of the market. We prove that the proposed double auction is budget
balanced, individually rational, and that it is a weakly dominant strategy for
EV drivers and charger owners to truthfully report their charging time
constraints. In addition, results from our computation study show that the
double auction achieves on average 94% efficiency compared with the optimal
solutions and scales well to larger problem instances.

latent variable modeling. In its basic form, variational inference employs a
fully factorized variational distribution and minimizes its KL divergence to
the posterior. As the minimization can only be carried out approximately, this
approximation induces a bias. In this paper, we revisit perturbation theory as
a powerful way of improving the variational approximation. Perturbation theory
relies on a form of Taylor expansion of the log marginal likelihood, vaguely in
terms of the log ratio of the true posterior and its variational approximation.
While first order terms give the classical variational bound, higher-order
terms yield corrections that tighten it. However, traditional perturbation
theory does not provide a lower bound, making it inapt for stochastic
optimization. In this paper, we present a similar yet alternative way of
deriving corrections to the ELBO that resemble perturbation theory, but that
result in a valid bound. We show in experiments on Gaussian Processes and
Variational Autoencoders that the new bounds are more mass covering, and that
the resulting posterior covariances are closer to the true posterior and lead

However, due to the bosonic nature of triplons, there are no emergent gapless

quantifying what precision of mass constraint is required to yield robust
atmospheric properties of planets. Here, we address this by conducting
retrievals on simulated JWST transmission spectra under various assumptions for
the degree of uncertainty in the planet's mass for a representative population
of seven planets ranging from terrestrials to warm Neptunes to hot Jupiters.
Only for the cloud-free, low metallicity gas giants are we able to infer
exoplanet mass from transmission spectroscopy alone, to ~10% accuracy. For low
metallicity cases (<4xSolar) we are able to accurately constrain atmospheric
properties without prior knowledge of the planet's mass. For all other cases
(including terrestrial-like planets), atmospheric properties can only be
inferred with a mass precision of better than ~50%. At this level, though, the
widths of the posterior distributions of the atmospheric properties are
dominated by the uncertainties in mass. With a precision of ~20%, the widths of
the posterior distributions are dominated by the spectroscopic data quality.
Therefore, as a rule-of-thumb, we recommend: a ~50% mass precision for initial
atmospheric characterization and a ~20% mass precision for more detailed

Indeed, being based on 1D radiative transfer (RT) theory, they work well only
for horizontally homogeneous clouds. A promising approach for treating clouds
as fully 3D objects is cloud tomography, and this has been demonstrated for
airborne observations. For cloud tomography from space, however, more efficient
forward 3D RT solvers are required. Here, we present a path forward,
acknowledging that optically thick clouds have ""veiled cores."" Photons
scattered into and out of this deep region do not contribute significant
information to the observed imagery about the inner structure of the cloud. We
investigate the location of the veiled core for the MISR and MODIS imagers.
While MISR provides multi-angle imagery in the visible and near-IR, MODIS
includes channels in the short-wave IR, albeit at a single view angle. This
combination will enable future 3D retrievals to disentangle the cloud's
effective particle size and optical thickness. We find that, in practice, the
veiled core is located at an optical distance of $\approx$5 starting from the
cloud boundary along the line-of-sight. For MODIS' absorbing wavelengths the
veiled core covers a larger volume, starting at smaller optical distances. This
result makes it possible to reduce the number of unknowns for the cloud

the 3D RT solver at the heart of the reconstruction algorithm.

fulfilling their own (not necessarily antagonistic) objectives. In the spirit
of evolutionary game theory, we suppose that the players have the right to
repeatedly update their respective strategies (for instance, to improve the

game which may eventually stabilise to an equilibrium. The objective of the
present paper is twofold. First, we aim at drawing a general framework to
reason about the termination of such dynamics. In particular, we identify
preorders on games (inspired from the classical notion of simulation between
transitions systems, and from the notion of graph minor) which preserve
termination of dynamics. Second, we show the applicability of the previously

multiple individual graphical models can be considered as variants of a common
group-level graphical model and inference of both the group- and
individual-level graphical models are of interest. Such problem arises from
many applications including multi-subject neuroimaging and genomics data
analysis. We propose a novel and efficient statistical method, the random
covariance model, to learn the group- and individual-level graphical models
simultaneously. The proposed method can be nicely interpreted as a random
covariance model that mimics the random effects model for mean structures in
linear regression. It accounts for similarity between individual graphical
models, identifies group-level connections that are shared by individuals in
the group, and at the same time infers multiple individual-level networks.
Compared to existing multiple graphical modeling methods that only focus on
individual-level networks, our model learns the group-level structure
underlying the multiple individual networks and enjoys computational efficiency
that is particularly attractive for practical use. We further define a measure
of degrees-of-freedom for the complexity of the model that can be used for
model selection. We demonstrate the asymptotic properties of the method and
show its finite sample performance through simulation studies. Finally, we
apply the proposed method to our motivating clinical data, a multi-subject

the ways in which humans interact with technology, the environment, and even

neural activity that account for two of the most important and least-understood
drivers of BCI illiteracy: individual differences in neural signals and
intra-individual differences across interdependent, time-varying neural states.
This paper describes the feasibility of using a game with a purpose (GWAP) as a
viable instrument for collecting data from BCI-relevant research tasks. By
leveraging game-related reward processes to maintain participant interest and
engagement, this approach will enable large amounts of BCI data to be acquired,
both across many individuals and longitudinally from specific individuals as
neural states vary naturally over time. Pilot and technical testing results are
presented here to demonstrate that the BCI-relevant tasks embedded within the

from more traditional BCI tasks. These preliminary data provide support and

rely solely on data-driven, and often incompletely trained, perception maps. In
particular, we consider a control problem where the state of the system is
estimated from measurements extracted from a high-dimensional sensor, such as a
camera. We assume that a map between the camera's readings and the state of the
system has been learned from a set of training data of finite size, from which
the noise statistics are also estimated. We show that algorithms that maximize
the estimation accuracy (as measured by the mean squared error) using the
learned perception map tend to perform poorly in practice, where the sensor's
statistics often differ from the learned ones. Conversely, increasing the
variability and size of the training data leads to robust performance, however
limiting the estimation accuracy, and thus the control performance, in nominal
conditions. Ultimately, our work proves the existence and the implications of a
fundamental trade-off between accuracy and robustness in perception-based
control, which, more generally, affects a large class of machine learning and
data-driven algorithms.

the control at each stage consists of several distinct decisions, each one made
by one of several agents. We introduce an approach, whereby at every stage,
each agent's decision is made by executing a local rollout algorithm that uses
a base policy, together with some coordinating information from the other
agents. The amount of local computation required at every stage by each agent
is independent of the number of agents, while the amount of total computation
(over all agents) grows linearly with the number of agents. By contrast, with
the standard rollout algorithm, the amount of total computation grows
exponentially with the number of agents. Despite the drastic reduction in
required computation, we show that our algorithm has the fundamental cost
improvement property of rollout: an improved performance relative to the base
policy. We also discuss possibilities to improve further the method's
computational efficiency through limited agent coordination and parallelization
of the agents' computations. Finally, we explore related approximate policy
iteration algorithms for infinite horizon problems, and we prove that the cost
improvement property steers the algorithm towards convergence to an
agent-by-agent optimal policy.

The error of a deep learning algorithm can in many situations be decomposed
into three parts, the approximation error, the generalization error, and the
optimization error. In this work we estimate for a certain deep learning
algorithm each of these three errors and combine these three error estimates to
obtain an overall error analysis for the deep learning algorithm under

convergence speed for the overall error of the deep learning algorithm under
consideration. Our convergence speed analysis is far from optimal and the
convergence speed that we establish is rather slow, increases exponentially in
the dimensions, and, in particular, suffers from the curse of dimensionality.
The main contribution of this work is, instead, to provide a full error
analysis (i) which covers each of the three different sources of errors usually
emerging in deep learning algorithms and (ii) which merges these three sources

However the underlying matrix model expressed in terms of fermions predict a
smooth time evolution across this point. By studying fluctuations around the

Ni$_{2}$In-type structures when annealed at temperatures below 600$^{\circ}$C.
While the Curie temperatures of the films are comparable to those of hexagonal
bulk MnCoGe, there is a reduction in the magnetization of the Mn$_{x}$CoGe
films relative to bulk MnCoGe, and a magnetization compensation point is
observed in the $x<1$ samples. To understand the behavior, we calculated the
magnetic moments of Mn-antisite defects in MnCoGe with density-function theory
(DFT) calculations. Models constructed from the calculation suggest that films
become ferrimagnetic due to the presence of Mn on the Co and Ge sites. In the
$x<1$ samples, these defects arose from the disorder in the films, whereas for
$x>1$, the excess Mn was driven onto the antisites. Mean field modeling of the
temperature dependence of the magnetization provides additional evidence for
ferrimagnetism. Our mean field and DFT models provide a description of how the
variation in film defects with composition will transition the magnetic
behavior from a compensated (V-type) to an uncompensated (Q-type) ferrimagnet.

module which allows the network to process small spatial regions of the video.
Apart from this, the framework utilizes a novel memory module based on
recurrent networks which helps in tracking objects when they move out of frame

effectiveness on two benchmark video object segmentation datasets; it
outperforms current offline approaches on the Youtube-VOS dataset while having

Using these counterfactual attention mechanisms we assess the extent to which

-- the probabilities that events are associated with a particular source. This
approach is applicable to any photon-resolving instrument, and thus well suited
to high-energy observations; we focus here on GeV $\gamma$-ray data from the
Fermi Large Area Telescope. Weights connect individual photons to the outputs
of a detailed, expensive likelihood analysis of a much larger data set. The
weighted events can be aggregated into arbitrary time spans ranging from
microseconds to years. Such retrospective grouping permits time- and
frequency-domain analysis over a wide range of scales and enables
characterization of disparate phenomena like blazar flares, $\gamma$-ray
bursts, pulsar pulses, novae, $\gamma$-ray binaries, and other variable
sources. To demonstrate the formalism, we incorporate photon weights into the
Bayesian blocks algorithm and perform a hierarchical time scale analysis of 3C
279 activity. We analyze pulsar pulse profiles and estimate the unpulsed
emission level and the optimal division of the data into on- and off-pulse
intervals. We extend the formalism to Fourier analysis and derive estimators
for power spectra, used to search for and characterize periodic sources. We
show how the Fast Fourier transform can be used to probe orbital periods as
short as a minute and we discuss mitigation of spurious signals. Our final
example combines time- and frequency- domain analysis to jointly characterize
the flares and orbital modulation of Cygnus X-3, yielding the strongest
detection of the orbital signal ($>$13$\sigma$) to date. Finally, we discuss
extensions of the work to other GeV sources and to X-ray and TeV observations.

symmetries in the model, we derive identities between all independent two point
correlations and fluctuations in three quantities (degrees of individuals and
the total number of links between the two subgroups) in the stationary state.
As simulations confirm these identities, we study only the fluctuations in
detail. Though qualitatively similar to those in the 2D Ising model, there are
several unusual aspects, due to the extreme Thouless effect. All these
anomalous fluctuations can be quantitatively understood with our theory,

considered here between $m$ discrete probability distributions supported each
on $n$ support points. First, we show that the standard linear programming (LP)
representation of the MOT problem is not a minimum-cost flow problem when $m
\geq 3$. This negative result implies that some combinatorial algorithms, e.g.,
network simplex method, are not suitable for approximating the MOT problem,
while the worst-case complexity bound for the deterministic interior-point
algorithm remains a quantity of $\tilde{O}(n^{3m})$. We then propose two simple
and \textit{deterministic} algorithms for approximating the MOT problem. The
first algorithm, which we refer to as \textit{multimarginal Sinkhorn}
algorithm, is a provably efficient multimarginal generalization of the Sinkhorn
algorithm. We show that it achieves a complexity bound of
$\tilde{O}(m^3n^m\varepsilon^{-2})$ for a tolerance $\varepsilon \in (0, 1)$.
This provides a first \textit{near-linear time} complexity bound guarantee for
approximating the MOT problem and matches the best known complexity bound for
the Sinkhorn algorithm in the classical OT setting when $m = 2$. The second
algorithm, which we refer to as \textit{accelerated multimarginal Sinkhorn}
algorithm, achieves the acceleration by incorporating an estimate sequence and
the complexity bound is $\tilde{O}(m^3n^{m+1/3}\varepsilon^{-4/3})$. This bound
is better than that of the first algorithm in terms of $1/\varepsilon$, and
accelerated alternating minimization
algorithm~\citep{Tupitsa-2020-Multimarginal} in terms of $n$. Finally, we
compare our new algorithms with the commercial LP solver \textsc{Gurobi}.
Preliminary results on synthetic data and real images demonstrate the

We show the unusual kinematics are naturally explained by the non-Keplerian

perturbations observed in the isovelocity curves of IRS 48 may be explained as
the product of the dynamical interaction between the companion and the disc.
The presence of a $\sim$0.4 M$_{\odot}$ companion at a $\sim$10 au separation
can qualitatively explain these observations. High spatial resolution line and

set of vertices to color, then iteratively applies a color change rule: If all
but one of a colored vertex's neighbors are colored, color (i.e. ""force"") the
remaining uncolored neighbor. Generally, the goal is to find the minimum number
of vertices to initially color such that all vertices eventually become
colored. Recently, equivalent formations of zero forcing have been developed in
different settings including sensor allocation to solve linear systems (K.-Lin
2018), controllability in follower-leader dynamics (Monshizadeh-Zhang-Camlibel
2014), and edge covering in specific hypergraphs (Brimkov-Fast-Hicks 2016).
  While many variations of zero forcing are motivated by an associated minimum
rank problem, these new formulations give new inspiration for new meaningful
zero forcing variants. In our case, we study a new variation based on the
linear algebraic interpretation mentioned above. In particular, what if there
is a juncture in a network that has a leak, and, hence, is unreliable to
facilitate solving a linear system on the network? In the context of zero
forcing this corresponds to the following variation we call $\ell$-forcing:
Given $\ell$, find a set of vertices such that for any set of $\ell$ vertices
that are unable to force, all vertices will still be colored. We compute the
$\ell$-forcing number for selected families of graphs including grid graphs.
Perhaps surprisingly, we find examples where additional edges make the graph
more ""resilient"" to these leaks. Further, we also implement known computational
methods for our new leaky forcing variation.

We used the [O{\sc iii}] detection limit for each GC to estimate the
luminosity-specific frequency of PNe, $\alpha$, and measured $\alpha$ in the
Virgo cluster GCs to be $\alpha \sim 3.9_{-0.7}^{+5.2}\times
10^{-8}\mathrm{PN}/L_\odot$. $\alpha$ in Virgo GCs is among the lowest values
reported in any environment, due in part to the large sample size, and is 5--6
times lower than that for the Galactic GCs. We suggest that $\alpha$ decreases
towards brighter and more massive clusters, sharing a similar trend as the
binary fraction, and the discrepancy between the Virgo and Galactic GCs can be
explained by the observational bias in extragalactic surveys toward brighter
GCs. This low but non-zero efficiency in forming PNe may highlight the
important role played by binary interactions in forming PNe in GCs. We argue
that a future survey of less massive Virgo GCs will be able to determine
whether PN production in Virgo GCs is governed by internal process (mass,
density, binary fraction), or is largely regulated by external environment.

velocity, we prove the finite time singularity for the 2D Boussinesq and the 3D
axisymmetric Euler equations with boundary and $C^{1,\alpha}$ initial data for
the velocity (and density in the case of Boussinesq equations). Our finite time
blowup solution for the 3D Euler equations and the singular solution considered
in [30,31] share many essential features, including the symmetry properties of
the solution, the flow structure, and the sign of the solution in each
quadrant, except that we use $C^{1,\alpha}$ initial velocity. We use a dynamic
rescaling formulation and follow the general framework of analysis developed in
[11]. We also use some strategy proposed in our recent joint work with Huang in
[7] and adopt several methods of analysis in [11] to establish the linear and
nonlinear stability of an approximate self-similar profile. The nonlinear
stability enables us to prove that the solution of the 3D Euler or the 2D
Boussinesq equations with $C^{1,\alpha}$ initial data will develop a finite
time singularity. Moreover, the velocity field has finite energy before the
singularity time.
  In the previous version of this paper, we proved the blowup results for the
3D axisymmetric Euler equations with initial data $(u_0^{\theta})^2, u_0^r,
u_0^z \in C^{1,\alpha}$. Though the velocity $u^r, u^z$ in the axisymmetric
setting is $C^{1,\alpha}$, our interpretation that the velocity is
$C^{1,\alpha}$ is not correct since the velocity in 3D also depends on
$u^{\theta}$, which is not $C^{1,\alpha}$. This oversight can be fixed easily

us with $\vert\Delta \mathbf{P}\vert$ $>\sim10 \mu$C/cm$^2$ due to a
quantum-of-polarization differences between $\delta=0.125$ structures.
Increasing the deficiency to $\delta=0.25$ yields $\vert\Delta \mathbf{P}\vert$

Our proposed approach, which we refer to as advantage-weighted regression

target values for a value function, and another to regress onto weighted target
actions for the policy. The method is simple and general, can accommodate
continuous and discrete actions, and can be implemented in just a few lines of
code on top of standard supervised learning methods. We provide a theoretical
motivation for AWR and analyze its properties when incorporating off-policy

a number of well-established state-of-the-art RL algorithms. AWR is also able
to acquire more effective policies than most off-policy algorithms when
learning from purely static datasets with no additional environmental

sequence space and RNA secondary structures are particular such phenotypes.
Compatible sequences i.e.~sequences that satisfy the base pairing constraints
of a given RNA structure play an important role in the context of neutral
networks and inverse folding. Sequences satisfying the constraints of two
structures simultaneously are called bicompatible and phenotypic change,
induced by erroneously replicating populations of RNA sequences, is closely
connected to bicompatibility. Furthermore, bicompatible sequences are relevant
for riboswitch sequences, beacons of evolution, realizing two distinct
phenotypes.
  Results: We present a full loop energy model Boltzmann sampler of
bicompatible sequences for pairs of structures. The novel dynamic programming
algorithm is based on a topological framework encapsulating the relations
between loops. We utilize our sequence sampler to study the energy spectra and
density of bicompatible sequences, the rankings of the structures and key
properties for evolutionary transitions.
  Conclusion: Our analysis of riboswitch sequences shows that key properties of
bicompatible sequences depend on the particular pair of structures. While there
always exist bicompatible sequences for random structure pairs, they are less
suited to facilitate transitions. We show that native riboswitch sequences
exhibit a distinct signature with regards to the ranking of their two
phenotypes relative to the minimum free energy, suggesting a new criterion for
identifying native sequences and sequences subjected to evolutionary pressure.

SGD on average decreases the trace of the Hessian of the loss. We also
generalize this result to other noise structures and show that isotropic noise

the door to new optimization approaches that may confer better generalization

variables using spuriously-correlated image features present only in the
training distribution instead of the true image features that denote a class.
It is often thought that this can be diagnosed visually using attribution (aka
saliency) maps. We study if this assumption is correct. In some prediction
tasks, such as for medical images, one may have some images with masks drawn by
a human expert, indicating a region of the image containing relevant
information to make the prediction. We study multiple methods that take
advantage of such auxiliary labels, by training networks to ignore distracting
features which may be found outside of the region of interest. This mask
information is only used during training and has an impact on generalization
accuracy depending on the severity of the shift between the training and test
distributions. Surprisingly, while these methods improve generalization
performance in the presence of a covariate shift, there is no strong
correspondence between the correction of attribution towards the features a
human expert has labelled as important and generalization performance. These
results suggest that the root cause of poor generalization may not always be
spatially defined, and raise questions about the utility of masks as
""attribution priors"" as well as saliency maps for explainable predictions.

Timing Explorer mission. The time-frequency maps derived by the wavelet
Z-transform and the Hilbert-Huang transform suggest that a new superorbital
period excursion event occurred in ~MJD 57100 (2015 March). This indicates the
excursion is recurrent and probably (quasi)periodic. The hardness ratio
obtained with the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) suggests increased
absorption during the transition from the high to the low state in the
superorbital cycle. Compared to the regular epochs, the superorbital profile
during the excursion epochs has a shallower and narrower valley, likely caused
by a flatter warp. By tracking the spin period evolution with the MAXI Gas Slit
Camera in 2-20 keV, we derive an averaged spin-up rate of
$\dot{\nu}=2.515(3)\times10^{-11}$ s$^{-2}$ during the period between MJD 55141

between the spin frequency residual and the superorbital frequency, but a
torque change accompanying the superorbital period excursion is possible. We
suggest that the accretion torque on the neutron star could be changed by
various mechanisms, including the change of mass accretion rate and the warp
angle. We update the value of the orbital decay as
$\dot{P}_{\rm{orb}}/P_{\rm{orb}}=-3.380(6)\times10^{-6}$ yr$^{-1}$. Finally, we
reconfirm the detection of the superorbital modulation in the optical band and
its coherence in phase with the X-ray modulation.

adopt an asychronized sleep-wake strategy to achieve an extended battery
lifetime (e.g., 10-25 years). We use age of information (AoI) to measure the
freshness of status updates, and design the sleep-wake parameters for
minimizing the weighted-sum peak AoI of the sources, subject to per-source
battery lifetime constraints. When the sensing time is zero, this sleep-wake
design problem can be solved by resorting to nested convex optimization;
however, for positive sensing times, the problem is non-convex. We devise a
low-complexity solution to solve this problem and prove that, for practical
sensing times, the solution is within a small gap from the optimum AoI
performance. Our numerical and NS-3 simulation results show that our solution
can indeed elongate the batteries lifetime of information sources, while
providing a competitive AoI performance.

simple, optimistic full-throughput execution. We have heavily extended OSACA to
support ARM instructions and critical path prediction including the detection
of loop-carried dependencies, which turns it into a versatile
cross-architecture modeling tool. We show runtime predictions for code on Intel
Cascade Lake, AMD Zen, and Marvell ThunderX2 micro-architectures based on
machine models from available documentation and semi-automatic benchmarking.

when it is examined either as a function of the channel parameters, or as a
function of $\rho$: as long as the channel is not too distant (in a certain
sense to be defined precisely) from the identity channel (i.e., the clean

value, $\rho_{\mbox{\tiny c}}$, there is no penalty at all in the guessing

sophisticated few-shot learning algorithms have been proposed based on the
notion that networks can easily overfit to novel examples if they are simply
fine-tuned using only a few examples. In this study, we show that in the
commonly used low-resolution mini-ImageNet dataset, the fine-tuning method
achieves higher accuracy than common few-shot learning algorithms in the 1-shot

the 5-shot task. We then evaluate our method with more practical tasks, namely
the high-resolution single-domain and cross-domain tasks. With both tasks, we
show that our method achieves higher accuracy than common few-shot learning
algorithms. We further analyze the experimental results and show that: 1) the
retraining process can be stabilized by employing a low learning rate, 2) using
adaptive gradient optimizers during fine-tuning can increase test accuracy, and
3) test accuracy can be improved by updating the entire network when a large

equilibrium to account for the fact that, in many practical situations, action
changes do not come for free. Specifically, we consider a population game and
introduce the coefficients $c_{ij}$ describing the cost an agent incurs by
switching from action $i$ to action $j$. We define an inertial Nash equilibrium
as a distribution over the action space where no agent benefits in moving to a
different action, while taking into account the cost of this change. First, we
show that the set of inertial Nash equilibria contains all the Nash equilibria,
but is in general not convex. Second, we argue that classical algorithms for
computing Nash equilibria cannot be used in the presence of switching costs. We
then propose a natural better-response dynamics and prove its convergence to an
inertial Nash equilibrium. We apply our results to predict the drivers'

generated because of fast-moving charged particles. In the presence of these
magnetic fields, the spin of particles is aligned either in the parallel or in
the antiparallel direction with respect to the direction of the magnetic field.
A finite magnetization is thus produced. It is known that a finite magnetic
susceptibility, $\chi_{m}$, changes the evolution of the energy density of the
quark-gluon plasma (QGP), which is believed to be created in these collisions.
Depending on whether the system under consideration is a paramagnetic
($\chi_{m}>0$) or diamagnetic ($\chi_{m}<0$) fluid, it slows down or speeds up
the decay of the energy density, and affects other thermodynamic quantities. In
general, one expects that the magnetic susceptibility depends on the magnetic
field and temperature. Bearing in mind that these parameters evolve with the
evolution of the fluid, a nonuniform magnetic susceptibility in this system is
thus expected. In this work, we first determine $\chi_{m}$ by using a certain
analogy to the standard anisotropic kinetic theory, where the one-particle
distribution function is replaced by the corresponding anisotropic distribution
function. We then determine the proper time dependence of the magnetic
susceptibility in the framework of the ideal transverse magnetohydrodynamics.

prey-predator system and to anticontrol the extinction of one of the species.
For a particular value of the bifurcation parameter, one of the system variable
dynamics is going to extinct, while another remains chaotic. To prevent the
extinction, a simple anticontrol algorithm is applied so that the system orbits
can escape from the vanishing trap. As the bifurcation parameter increases, the
system presents quasiperiodic, stable, chaotic and also hyperchaotic orbits.
Some of the chaotic attractors are Kaplan-Yorke type, in the sense that the sum
of its Lyapunov exponents is positive. Also, atypically for undriven discrete
systems, it is numerically found that, for some small parameter ranges, the
system seemingly presents strange nonchaotic attractors. It is shown both
analytically and by numerical simulations that the original system and the
anticontrolled system undergo several Neimark-Sacker bifurcations. Beside the
classical numerical tools for analyzing chaotic systems, such as phase
portraits, time series and power spectral density, the 0-1 test is used to
differentiate regular attractors from chaotic attractors.

excitable soft actuators, triggered from outside by magnetic fields. These
magnetic fields induce or alter the magnetic interactions between discrete
rigid particles embedded in a soft elastic polymeric matrix, leading to overall
deformations. It is a major challenge in theory to correctly predict from the
discrete particle configuration the type of deformation resulting for a
finite-sized system. Considering an elastic sphere, we here present such an
approach. The method is in principle exact, at least within the framework of
linear elasticity theory and for large enough interparticle distances.
Different particle arrangements are considered. We find, for instance, that
regular simple cubic configurations show elongation of the sphere along the
magnetization if oriented along a face or space diagonal of the cubic unit
cell. Contrariwise, with the magnetization along the edge of the cubic unit
cell, they contract. The opposite is true in this geometry for body- and
face-centered configurations. Remarkably, for the latter configurations but the
magnetization along a face or space diagonal of the unit cell, contraction was
observed to revert to expansion with decreasing Poisson ratio of the elastic
material. Randomized configurations were considered as well. They show a
tendency of elongating the sphere along the magnetization, which is more
pronounced for compressible systems. Our results can be tested against actual
experiments for spherical samples. Moreover, our approach shall support the
search of optimal particle distributions for a maximized effect of actuation.

reachability. The input is a graph where the edges are labeled with different
types of opening and closing parentheses, and the reachability information is
computed via paths whose parentheses are properly matched. We present new
results for Dyck reachability problems with applications to alias analysis and
data-dependence analysis. Our main contributions, that include improved upper
bounds as well as lower bounds that establish optimality guarantees, are as
follows.
  First, we consider Dyck reachability on bidirected graphs, which is the
standard way of performing field-sensitive points-to analysis. Given a
bidirected graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, we present: (i)~an algorithm
with worst-case running time $O(m + n \cdot \alpha(n))$, where $\alpha(n)$ is
the inverse Ackermann function, improving the previously known $O(n^2)$ time
bound; (ii)~a matching lower bound that shows that our algorithm is optimal wrt
to worst-case complexity; and (iii)~an optimal average-case upper bound of
$O(m)$ time, improving the previously known $O(m \cdot \log n)$ bound.
  Second, we consider the problem of context-sensitive data-dependence
analysis, where the task is to obtain analysis summaries of library code in the
presence of callbacks. Our algorithm preprocesses libraries in almost linear
time, after which the contribution of the library in the complexity of the
client analysis is only linear, and only wrt the number of call sites.
  Third, we prove that combinatorial algorithms for Dyck reachability on
general graphs with truly sub-cubic bounds cannot be obtained without obtaining
sub-cubic combinatorial algorithms for Boolean Matrix Multiplication, which is
a long-standing open problem. We also show that the same hardness holds for
graphs of constant treewidth.

the transition energies can be sufficiently improved by adding corrugations.
Particularly, the transition energy between the adjacent eigenstates
corresponds to energy levels difference based on the wavefunction of annular
wire, and the number of the energy levels is equal to the number of
corrugations. And the larger magnitude of corrugations is capable of increasing
the number of bound states. In addition, the distribution of ground state
probability density is reconstructed by the corrugations, and the energy shift
is generated.

connection with systems presenting long--range interactions. In fact, they were
observed in numerical computations for models of such a type, as occurring in

we exhibit two apparently new results. The first one is that Tsallis
distributions occur also in an ionic--crystal model with long--range Coulomb
forces, which is so realistic as to reproduce in an impressively good way the
experimental infrared spectra. Thus such distributions may be expected to be
actual physical features of crystals. The second result is that Tsallis
distributions occur in the standard short--range FPU model too, so that the
presence of long--range interactions is not a necessary condition for Tsallis
distributions to occur. In fact, this is in agreement with a previous result of
the first author in connection with the statistics of return times for the
classical FPU model. We thus confirm the thesis advanced by Tsallis himself,
that the relevant property for a dynamical system to present Tsallis

lecture-based. This is despite recommendations such as those given by the
American Statistical Association's GAISE report that more emphasis should be
placed on active learning strategies where students take more responsibility
for their own learning. One possible model is that of collaborative learning,
where students learn in groups through carefully crafted `problems', which has
long been suggested as a strategy for teaching statistics.
  In this article, we review two specific approaches that fall under the
collaborative learning model: problem- and team-based learning. We consider the
evidence for changing to this model of teaching in statistics, as well as give
practical suggestions on how this could be implemented in typical statistics
classes in Higher Education.

way of studying quantum field theories, and has led to impressive achievements.
In particular, it significantly deepened our understanding of quantum
chromodynamics. Yet, some very relevant problems remain inherently challenging,
such as real time evolution, or the presence of a chemical potential, cases in
which Monte Carlo simulations are hindered by a sign problem.
  In the last few years, a number of possible alternatives have been put
forward, based on quantum information ideas, which could potentially open the
access to areas of research that have so far eluded more standard methods. They
include tensor network calculations, quantum simulations with different
physical platforms and quantum computations, and constitute nowadays a vibrant
research area. Experts from different fields, including experimental and
theoretical high energy physics, condensed matter, and quantum information, are
turning their attention to these interdisciplinary possibilities, and driving
the progress of the field. The aim of this article is to review the status and
perspectives of these new avenues for the exploration of lattice gauge
theories.

possibilities for driving materials far from equilibrium toward new states.
Moreover, ultra-short pulses of light make it possible to induce and to record
photo-switching on a very short time-scale, opening the way to fascinating new
functionalities. Among molecular materials, Fe(II) complexes exhibit an
ultrafast spin-state transition during which the spin state of the complex
switches from a low spin state (LS, S=0) to a high spin state (HS, S=2). The
latter process is remarkable: it takes place within ~100 fs with a quantum
efficiency of ~100%. Moreover, the spin state switching induces an important
shift of the broad metal to ligand absorption band of the complex and it
results in large modifications of the physical and chemical properties of the
compounds. But, because most of the Fe(II) complexes crystallize in
centrosymmetric space groups, this prevents them from exhibiting piezoelectric,
ferroelectric as well as second-order nonlinear optical properties such as
second harmonic generation (SHG). This considerably limits their potential
applications. We have recently synthesized [Fe(phen)3]
[$\Delta$-As2(tartrate)2] chiral complexes that crystallize in a
noncentrosymmetric 32 space group. Hereafter, upon the excitation of a thin
film of these complexes by a femtosecond laser pulse and performing
simultaneously transient absorption (TRA) and time-resolved SHG (TRSH)
measurements, we have recorded the ultrafast LS to HS switching. Whereas a
single TRA measurement only gives partial information, we demonstrate that TRSH
readily reveals the different mechanisms in play during the HS to LS state
relaxation. Moreover, a simple model makes it possible to evaluate the
relaxation times as well as the hyperpolarizabilities of the different excited
states through which the system travels during the spin-state transition

camera-embedded pill-shaped device that passes through the gastrointestinal
(GI) tract, captures and transmits images to an external receiver. WCE devices
are considered as a replacement of conventional endoscopy methods which are
usually painful and distressful for the patients. WCE devices produce over
60,000 images typically during their course of operation inside the GI tract.
These images need to be examined by expert physicians who attempt to identify
frames that contain inflammation / disease. It can be hectic for a physician to
go through such a large number of frames, hence computer-aided detection
methods are considered an efficient alternative. Various anomalies can take
place in the GI tract of a human being but the most important and common ones
and the aim of this survey are ulcers, polyps, and tumors. In this paper, we
have presented a survey of contemporary computer-aided detection methods that
take WCE images as input and classify those images in a diseased/abnormal or
disease-free/ normal image. We have considered methods that detect tumors,
polyps and ulcers, as these three diseases lie in the same category.
Furthermore bleeding inside the GI tract may be the symptoms of these diseases;
so an attempt is also made to enlighten the research work done for bleeding
detection inside WCE. Several studies have been included with in-depth detail
of their methodologies, findings, and conclusions. Also, we have attempted to
classify these methods based on their technical aspects. This paper also
includes a potential proposal for joint classification of aforementioned three
diseases.

our Solar System and beyond, and in the interpretation of atmospheric
measurements. Hydrodynamic escape is generally thought to be driven by the flux
of extreme ultraviolet photons that the planet receives from its host star.
Here, we show that the escape from planets orbiting hot stars proceeds through
a different yet complementary process: drawing its energy from the intense near
ultraviolet emission of the star that is deposited within an optically thin,
high-altitude atmospheric layer of hydrogen excited into the lower state of the
Balmer series. The ultra-hot exoplanet KELT-9b likely represents the first
known instance of this Balmer-driven escape. In this regime of hydrodynamic
escape, the near ultraviolet emission from the star is more important at
determining the planet mass loss than the extreme ultraviolet emission, and
uncertainties in the latter become less critical. Further, we predict that gas
exoplanets around hot stars may experience catastrophic mass loss when they are
less massive than 1--2 Jupiter masses and closer-in than KELT-9b, thereby
challenging the paradigm that all large exoplanets are stable to atmospheric
escape. We argue that extreme escape will affect the demographics of close-in
exoplanets orbiting hot stars.

characterisation of brown dwarf and planet companions can further our knowledge
of their formation and evolution, and expanding such a sample is therefore our
primary goal. We used the Zurich IMaging POLarimeter (ZIMPOL) of the SPHERE
instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to observe the known
$38-72$M$_{\mathrm{J}}$ companion orbiting PZ Tel, obtaining simultaneous
angular differential imaging observations in both continuum and narrow

interest. The numerical operations in such algorithms are generally implemented
using finite-precision arithmetic, either fixed- or floating-point, most of
which operate least-significant digit first. This results in a fundamental
problem: if, after some time, the result has not converged, is this because we
have not run the algorithm for enough iterations or because the arithmetic in
some iterations was insufficiently precise? There is no easy way to answer this
question, so users will often over-budget precision in the hope that the answer
will always be to run for a few more iterations. We propose a fundamentally new
approach: with the appropriate arithmetic able to generate results from
most-significant digit first, we show that fixed compute-area hardware can be
used to calculate an arbitrary number of algorithmic iterations to arbitrary
precision, with both precision and approximant index increasing in lockstep.
Consequently, datapaths constructed following our principles demonstrate
efficiency over their traditional arithmetic equivalents where the latter's
precisions are either under- or over-budgeted for the computation of a result
to a particular accuracy. Use of most-significant digit-first arithmetic
additionally allows us to declare certain digits to be stable at runtime,
avoiding their recalculation in subsequent iterations and thereby increasing
performance and decreasing memory footprints. Versus arbitrary-precision
iterative solvers without the optimisations we detail herein, we achieve up-to
16$\times$ performance speedups and 1.9x memory savings for the evaluated

the data from a different scanner, removing variability present in the source

to the scanner. Experiments with alterations using a free water compartment,
which is not simulated in the training data, shows that the effect size induced

highly P- and B-doped Si are looked into in detail. Scattering rates of phonons
by point defects, as well as by electrons, are calculated from first
principles. Lattice thermal conductivities are calculated considering these
scattering mechanisms both individually and together. It is found that at low
carrier concentrations and temperatures phonon scattering by electrons is
dominant and can reproduce the experimental thermal conductivity reduction.
However, at higher doping concentrations the scattering rates of phonons by
point defects dominate the ones by electrons except for the lowest phonon
frequencies. Consequently, phonon scattering by point defects contributes
substantially to the thermal conductivity reduction in Si at defect
concentrations above $10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$ even at room temperature. Only when,
phonon scattering by both point defects and electrons are taken into account,

outbreaks and yet they are often overlooked in epidemiological models.
Understanding to what extent behavioral changes determine the outcome of
spreading epidemics is essential to design effective intervention policies.
Here we explore, analytically, the interplay between the personal decision to
protect oneself from infection and the spreading of an epidemic. We do so by
coupling a decision game based on the perceived risk of infection with a
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model. Interestingly, we find that the simple
decision on whether to protect oneself is enough to modify the course of the
epidemics, by generating sustained steady oscillations in the prevalence. We
deem these oscillations detrimental, and propose two intervention policies
aimed at modifying behavioral patterns to help alleviate them. Surprisingly, we
find that pulsating campaigns, compared to continuous ones, are more effective
in diminishing such oscillations.

superfluid flows. Despite this it has been observed that turbulence in
superfluids can, in a statistical sense, share many of the properties of its
classical brethren; coherent bundles of superfluid vortices are often invoked
as an important feature leading to this quasi-classical behavior. A recent
experimental study [E. Rusaouen, B. Rousset, and P.-E. Roche, EPL, {\bf 118},
1, 14005, (2017)] inferred the presence of these bundles through intermittency
in the pressure field, however direct visualization of the quantized vortices
to corroborate this finding was not possible. In this work, we performed
detailed numerical simulations of superfluid turbulence at the level of
individual quantized vortices through the vortex filament model. Through
course-graining of the turbulent fields, we find compelling evidence supporting
these conclusions at low temperature. Moreover, elementary simulations of an
isolated bundle show that the number of vortices inside a bundle can be
directly inferred from the magnitude of the pressure dip, with good theoretical
agreement derived from the HVBK equations. Full simulations of superfluid
turbulence show strong spatial correlations between course-grained vorticity
and low pressure regions, with intermittent vortex bundles appearing as
deviations from the underlying Maxwellian (vorticity) and Gaussian (pressure)
distributions. Finally, simulations of a decaying random tangle in an
ultra-quantum regime show a unique fingerprint in the evolution of the pressure
distribution, which we argue can be fully understood using the HVBK framework.

without exception the semileptonic decays of heavy baryons are described in
cascade fashion as a sequence of two two-body decays $B_1 \to B_2 + W_{\rm
off-shell}$ and $W_{\rm off-shell} \to \ell + \nu_\ell$ whereas neutron $\beta$
decays are analyzed as true three-body decays $n \to p + e^- +\bar \nu_e$.
Within the cascade approach it is possible to define a set of seven angular
observables for polarized neutron $\beta$ decays as well as the longitudinal,
transverse and normal polarization of the decay electron. We determine the
dependence of the observables on the usual vector and axial vector form
factors. In order to be able to assess the importance of recoil corrections we
expand the rate and the $q^2$ averages of the observables up to NLO and NNLO in
the recoil parameter $\delta=(M_n-M_p)/(M_n+M_p)= 0.689\cdot 10^{-3}$.

helps in analyzing vital attributes and behaviors of the malware. The main
contribution of this work is the identification of important and distinct
characteristics of Ransomware that can help in detecting them. Finally, based
on the selected features, both conventional machine learning techniques and
Transfer Learning based Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have been used to
detect Ransomware. In order to perform feature engineering and analysis, two

3646 samples (1700 Ransomware and 1946 Goodware). On the other hand, the
dynamic dataset comprised of 3444 samples (1455 Ransomware and 1989 Goodware).
Through various experiments, it is observed that the Registry changes, API
calls, and DLLs are the most important features for Ransomware detection.
Additionally, important sequences are found with the help of the N-Gram
technique. It is also observed that in the case of Registry Delete operation,
if a malicious file tries to delete registries, it follows a specific and
repeated sequence. However, for the benign file, it doesnt follow any specific
sequence or repetition. Similarly, an interesting observation made through this
study is that there is no common Registry deleted sequence between malicious
and benign files. And thus this discernible fact can be readily exploited for

follows the general strategy of Generative Adversarial Networks, where an image
generator network learns to create image samples that are realistic enough to
fool a discriminator network into believing that they are natural images. In
contrast, in our approach the image generation is split into 2 stages. In the
first stage a generator network outputs 3D objects. In the second, a
differentiable renderer produces an image of the 3D objects from random
viewpoints. The key observation is that a realistic 3D object should yield a
realistic rendering from any plausible viewpoint. Thus, by randomizing the
choice of the viewpoint our proposed training forces the generator network to
learn an interpretable 3D representation disentangled from the viewpoint. In
this work, a 3D representation consists of a triangle mesh and a texture map
that is used to color the triangle surface by using the UV-mapping technique.
We provide analysis of our learning approach, expose its ambiguities and show

explaining its improvement with only a few selected examples or targeted test

are promising for ultimate scaled electron device applications because of the
improved electrostatics to atomically thin body thickness. However, compared
with the typical thickness of ~5-nm for Si-on-insulator (SOI), the advantage of
the ultimate thickness limit of monolayer for the device performance has not
been fully proved yet, especially for the on-state at the accumulation region.
Here, we present much stronger quantum-mechanical effect at the accumulation
region based on the C-V analysis for top-gate MoS2 FETs. The self-consistent
calculation elucidated that the electrons are confined in the monolayer
thickness, unlike in the triangle potential formed by the electric field for
SOI, the gate-channel capacitance is ideally maximized to the gate insulator
capacitance since the capacitive contribution of the channel can be neglected
due to the negligible channel thickness. This quantum-mechanical effect agreed
well with the experimental results. Therefore, monolayer 2D channels are
suggested to be used to enhance the on-current as well as the gate modulation
ability.

sample the parameter domain such that the training set is adaptively updated
starting from a coarse set with a small number of parameter samples. A sharp a

Functions are used to interpolate the error estimator over a separate fine

parameter samples satisfying a defined tolerance are adaptively removed from
the coarse training set. The approach is shown to avoid high computational

evidence that the reduced-order model meets the defined tolerance over an

was tasked by the Competitiveness Council, a configuration of the Council of

Infrastructures' performance. To this end, ESFRI established a working group,
which has proposed 21 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to monitor the progress
of the Research Infrastructures (RIs) addressed towards their objectives. The
RIs were then asked to assess their relevance for their institution. The paper
aims to identify the relevance of certain indicators for particular groups of
RIs by using cluster and discriminant analysis. This could contribute to
development of a monitoring system, tailored to particular RIs.
  To obtain a typology of the RIs, we first performed cluster analysis of the
RIs according to their properties, which revealed clusters of RIs with similar
characteristics, based on to the domain of operation, such as food, environment
or engineering. Then, discriminant analysis was used to study how the relevance
of the KPIs differs among the obtained clusters. This analysis revealed that
the percentage of RIs correctly classified into five clusters, using the KPIs,
is 80%. Such a high percentage indicates that there are significant differences
in the relevance of certain indicators, depending on the ESFRI domain of the
RI. The indicators therefore need to be adapted to the type of infrastructure.
It is therefore proposed that the Strategic Working Groups of ESFRI addressing
specific domains should be involved in the tailored development of the
monitoring of pan-European RIs.

Here we present a measurement technique based on lock-in amplification that
allows for in-situ detection of the liquidus and solidus temperatures as well
as structural phase transitions. A thin, metallic measurement wire is mounted
in close vicinity to the melt. Characteristic anomalies in the time-dependent
electrical resistivity of this wire allow for the detection of latent heat
release without using a reference crucible. The method is implemented in a
'feedback furnace' and enables an adjustment of the temperature profile based
on the occurrence or absence of phase transitions. The absolute temperature
serves as an additional source of information. Obtained phase transition
temperatures are in good agreement with differential thermal analysis (DTA).

phase separation. Here we focus on the quasi-two-dimensional case, analyzing in
computer simulation the effects of a magnetic field parallel to the system
plane. Our results evidence that the field drastically changes the structure of
the forming network: chains and elongated clusters parallel to the field are
favored whereas perpendicular connecting structures tend to be supressed,
leading to the unknotting of the networks observed at zero field. Importantly,
we found that moderate field strengths lead to the formation of larger clusters
at intermediate time intervals than in the case of weak and strong fields.
Moreover, the latter tend to limit the overall growth of the clusters at longer
time scales. These results may be relevant in different systems governed by
similar magnetically driven aggregation processes as, for example, in the
formation of iron-rich planetesimals in protoplanetary discs or for magnetic

orientation of the electron spin. These two effects limit the scope of
information processing based on these atoms to essentially only one magnetic
degree of freedom: the spin. In this work, we gain independent access to both
the spin and orbital degrees of freedom of a single atom, inciting and probing

zero-field splitting--the largest reported for Fe atoms on surfaces--and an
unquenched uniaxial orbital moment that closely approaches the free-atom value.
We demonstrate a full reversal of the orbital moment through a single-electron
tunneling event between the tip and Fe atom, a process that is mediated by a
charged virtual state and leaves the spin unchanged. These results, which we
corroborate using density functional theory and first-principles multiplet
calculations, demonstrate independent control over the spin and orbital degrees

deep learning against adversarial perturbations. We first show that attacking a
CNN-based anti-spoofing face authentication system turns out to be a difficult
task. When a spoofed face image is attacked in the physical world, in fact, the
attack has not only to remove the rebroadcast artefacts present in the image,
but it has also to take into account that the attacked image will be recaptured
again and then compensate for the distortions that will be re-introduced after
the attack by the subsequent rebroadcast process. Subsequently, we propose a
method to craft robust physical domain adversarial images against anti-spoofing
CNN-based face authentication. The attack built in this way can successfully
pass all the steps in the authentication chain (that is, face detection, face
recognition and spoofing detection), by achieving simultaneously the following
goals: i) make the spoofing detection fail; ii) let the facial region be
detected as a face and iii) recognized as belonging to the victim of the
attack. The effectiveness of the proposed attack is validated experimentally
within a realistic setting, by considering the REPLAY-MOBILE database, and by
feeding the adversarial images to a real face authentication system capturing
the input images through a mobile phone camera.

the otherwise chaotic flows are streamlined into flow lanes with alternating
directions, reproducing the experimental laning state that has been obtained by
interfacing microtubule-motor protein mixtures with smectic liquid crystals.
Within a flow-tumbling regime, however, we find that no such laning state is
possible. Instead, the synergistic effects of friction anisotropy and flow
tumbling can lead to the emergence of bound pairs of topological defects that
align at an angle to the easy flow direction and navigate together throughout
the domain. In addition to confirming the mechanism behind the laning states
observed in experiments, our findings emphasise the role of the flow aligning

their surroundings, i.e., objects are required to be functionally grasped

pose such that a direct grasp can be performed. Inspired by the anthropomorphic
nature of humanoid robots, we propose an approach that first grasps an object
with one hand, obtaining full control over its pose, and performs the
functional grasp with the second hand subsequently. Thus, we develop a fully
autonomous pipeline for dual-arm functional regrasping of novel familiar
objects, i.e., objects never seen before that belong to a known object
category, e.g., spray bottles. This process involves semantic segmentation,
object pose estimation, non-rigid mesh registration, grasp sampling, handover
pose generation and in-hand pose refinement. The latter is used to compensate
for the unpredictable object movement during the first grasp. The approach is
applied to a human-like upper body. To the best knowledge of the authors, this
is the first system that exhibits autonomous bimanual functional regrasping
capabilities. We demonstrate that our system yields reliable success rates and
can be applied on-line to real-world tasks using only one off-the-shelf RGB-D

lines at UV and optical wavelengths to investigate the presence of ongoing

a forward modelling of the observed spectra with the ForMoSA code (Nested

detectors under continuous light. Usually, the bias circuit of a SiPM has a
resistor connected in series to it, which protects the sensor from drawing too
high current. This resistor introduces a voltage drop when a SiPM draws a
steady current, when illuminated by constant light. This reduces the actual
SiPM bias and then its sensitivity to light. As a matter of fact, this effect
changes all relevant SiPM features, both electrical (i.e. breakdown voltage,
gain, pulse amplitude, dark count rate and optical crosstalk) and optical (i.e.
photon detection efficiency). To correctly operate such devices, it is then
fundamental to calibrate them under various illumination levels.
  In this work, we focus on the large area ($\sim$1~cm$^{2}$) hexagonal SiPM
S10943-2832(X) produced by Hamamatsu HPK for the camera of a gamma-ray
telescope with 4 m-diameter mirror, called the SST-1M. We characterize this
device under light rates raging from 3~MHz up to 5~GHz of photons per sensor at
room temperature (T = 25 $^{\circ}$C). From these studies, a model is developed
in order to derive the parameters needed to correct for the voltage drop
effect. This model can be applied for instance in the analysis of the data
acquired by the camera to correct for the effect. The experimental results are
also compared with a toy Monte Carlo simulation and finally, a solution is
proposed to compensate for the voltage drop.

temperature and hydrostatic pressure measuring in situ are technologically well
developed, while in the salinity measuring there are still unsolved problems.
This is due to the fact that salinity is such a property that it is simply

a group of Chromospheric ultraviolet bursts (UVBs) associated with an active
region. We classify the UVBs into two types: smaller ones that can only be
measured once by the scanning slit, and larger UVBs that are measured twice by
the slit. The UVBs' optically thin Si IV 1402.77 \r{A} line profiles are
studied intensively. By fitting the smaller UVBs' lines with 1-2 Gaussians, we
obtain a variety of line-of-sight flow measurements that hint various 3-D
orientations of small scale magnetic reconnections, each associated with a UVB.
The larger UVBs are, however, unique in a way that they each have two sets of
measurements at two slit locations. This makes it possible to unambiguously
detect two oppositely directed heated flows jetting out of a single UVB, a
signature of magnetic reconnection operating at the heart of the UVB. Here we
report on the first of such an observation. Additionally, all the optically
thin Si IV 1402.77 \r{A} line profiles from those UVBs consistently demonstrate
excessive broadening, an order of magnitude larger than would be expected from
thermal broadening, suggesting that those small scale reconnections could be
driven by large scale (macro-scale) turbulence in the active region.

kinetic models that are self-consistently coupled to the evolution of the

parameterized runaway generation rates rather than solving the full kinetic
problem. However, currently available generation rates neglect several
important effects; in particular, they are not valid in the presence of
partially ionized impurities. In this work, we construct a multilayer neural
network for the Dreicer runaway generation rate which is trained on data
obtained from kinetic simulations performed for a wide range of plasma
parameters and impurities. The neural network accurately reproduces the Dreicer
runaway generation rate obtained by the kinetic solver. By implementing it in a
fluid runaway electron modelling tool, we show that the improved generation
rates lead to significant differences in the self-consistent runaway dynamics
as compared to the results using the previously available formulas for the
runaway generation rate.

optical dipole traps have enabled an unprecedented level of control over
neutral atoms and molecules both at the level of quantum ensembles as well as
individual particles. It was found recently that in some situations it is
highly advantageous to confine atomic and molecular ions without employing any
radiofrequency-based Paul traps or strong external magnetic fields as used in
Penning traps, e.g. when investigating the interaction of neutral atoms and
ions in the regime of ultralow interaction energies. Adapting optical traps for
ions is a promising way to approach such scenarios and the focus of this work
is to present a comprehensive overview of the background and concepts behind
this technique as well as to discuss the currently achievable level of control,

laboratory experiments to understand the molecular growth pathways initiated by
photochemistry in the upper layers of the atmospheres. Major species and
dominant reaction pathways are used to feed chemical network models that
reproduce the chemical and physical processes of these complex environments.
Energetic UV photons initiate very efficient chemistry by forming reactive
species in the ionospheres of planets and satellites. Here we present a
laboratory experiment based on a new photoreactor with an irradiation beam
produced by high order harmonic generation of a near infra-red femtosecond
laser. This type of EUV source is nowadays stable enough to enable long-lasting
experiments during which a plethora of individual reactions can take place. Its
high accessibility is such that chemical initial conditions can be
systematically varied to investigate the complexity of the upper atmosphere of
planets. In order to demonstrate the validity of our approach, we shone during
7 hours at 14 eV with a flux of 1010 photons sec-1 cm-2, a N2/CH4 (5%) based
gas mixture defined by a 60 {\mu}m free mean-path. Such conditions are able to
mimic the photochemistry of Titan N2 upper atmosphere. The reaction products
reveal the formation of hydrocarbons and N-bearing species like dimethyldiazene
(C2H6N2), the largest compound detected in this new photoreactor. This work
represents an important step in the use of a EUV irradiated closed-cell chamber
for the generation of photochemical analogues of Titan aerosols to better

which it remains invariant: i.e. type I (coordinate transformations), III
(marginalizations) and special cases of type IV (embeddings, products).
Estimators which fail to meet these standards are not \textit{robust} in their
general applicability. Since most machine learning tasks employ transformations
which belong to the classes referenced in part I, the mutual information can
tell us which transformations are most optimal\cite{Carrara_Ernst}. There are
several classes of estimation methods in the literature, such as non-parametric
estimators like the one developed by Kraskov et. al\cite{KSG}, and its improved
versions\cite{LNC}. These estimators are extremely useful, since they rely only
on the geometry of the underlying sample, and circumvent estimating the
probability distribution itself. We explore the robustness of this family of
estimators in the context of our design criteria.

suitably to the boundary. Here, we show that such results are false for
equations driven by a wide class of nonlocal fractional operators, extending
previous findings for some models of the fractional Laplacian operator.
Actually, different blow-up phenomena may occur at the boundary of the domain.
We describe such explosive behaviours and obtain precise quantitative estimates
depending on simple parameters of the nonlocal pperators. Our unifying

are now of great interest across many areas of physics. The main idea of a
synthetic dimension is to couple together suitable degrees of freedom, such as
a set of internal atomic states, in order to mimic the motion of a particle
along an extra spatial dimension. This approach provides a way to engineer
lattice Hamiltonians and enables the realisation of higher-dimensional
topological models in platforms with lower dimensionality. We give an overview
of the recent progress in studying topological matter in synthetic dimensions.
After reviewing proposals and realizations in various setups, we discuss future
prospects in many-body physics, applications, and topological effects in three
or more spatial dimensions.

impaired by the inherent random characteristics of the data acquisition leading
to statistical image noise. Edge preserving spatial variation regularized
iterative image reconstruction approaches require case-specific control
parameter adaptation for optimized contrast-vs-noise tradeoff. For MLEM
reconstruction, we propose and evaluate iRDF which automatically adapts RDP
edge preservation parameters according to local image noise and PET data
characteristics. In order to distinguish between clustered noise spots and
small tumors, we introduce hot-spot artifact correction. The proposed method
was evaluated using NEMA IQ phantom data as well as clinical patient data.
After initial iRDF base parameter tuning, results showed that iRDF maintained
similar image quality regardless of statistics without requiring manual
parameter tuning, in contrast to e.g. RDP. With NEMA-IQ phantom data, local
image variance was reduced to ~33%, while contrast of small spheres could be
mostly preserved compared to nonregularized OSEM. Using a quarter of the
originally acquired list-mode data, a noise decreased to ~22% while SUV-max has
been reduced to ~75% of OSEM-based results. NEMA phantom and clinical data
showed improved signal-recovery-to-noise ratios, leading to an overall ~3 times
higher feature detectability especially in small lesions. Finally, the
processed examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed hot-pixel
artefact correction. The proposed auto-adaptive iRDF regularization
demonstrates high potential to reduce the burden of prior parameter tuning. It
realizes a trade-off between feature contrast and image noise on both local and
global scale. According to increased noise robustness at different count
statistics, iRDF can be considered an interesting alternative especially for
low-dose PET imaging applications.

an orbital period of 17.7 hours. In 2011, using the MOST space telescope, a
quasi-sinusoidal modulation in flux was detected with the same period as the
planetary orbit. The amplitude of this modulation was too large to be explained
as the change in light reflected or emitted by the planet. Aims. The MOST
telescope continued to observe 55 Cnc e for a few weeks per year over five
years, covering 143 individual transits. This paper presents the analysis of
the observed phase modulation throughout these observations and a search for
the secondary eclipse of the planet. Methods. The most important source of
systematic noise in MOST data is due to stray-light reflected from the Earth,
which is modulated with both the orbital period of the satellite and the
Earth's rotation period. We present a new technique to deal with this source of
noise, which we combined with standard detrending procedures for MOST data. We
then performed Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses of the detrended light curves,
modeling the planetary transit and phase modulation. Results. We find phase
modulations similar to those seen in 2011 in most of the subsequent years;
however, the amplitude and phase of maximum light are seen to vary from 113 to
28 ppm and from 0.1 to 3.8 rad. The secondary eclipse is not detected, but we
constrain the geometric albedo of the planet to less than 0.47 (2$\sigma$).
Conclusions. While we cannot identify a single origin of the observed optical
modulation, we propose a few possible scenarios. Those include star-planet
interaction or the presence of a transiting circumstellar torus of dust.
However, a detailed interpretation of these observations is limited by their
photometric precision. Additional observations at optical wavelengths could
contribute to uncovering the underlying physical processes.

amplitude of the soliton increases beyond a critical wavevector value. Finally,
we consider the transmission of an extended nonlinear wave across the void

a quantum control process by using external laser fields in neutral Rydberg
atoms. This dephasing is a major issue that limits the realizable fidelity of a
quantum entangling gate with neutral atoms when there is a {\it gap} time for
the Rydberg atom to drift freely. We find that such a dephasing can be largely
suppressed by using a transition in a `V'-type dual-rail configuration. The
left~(right) arm of this `V' represents a transition to a Rydberg state
$|r_{1(2)}\rangle$ with a Rabi frequency $\Omega e^{ikz}~(\Omega e^{-ikz})$,
where $z$ is frozen without atomic drift, but changes linearly in each
experimental cycle. Such a configuration is equivalent to a transition between
the ground state and a hybrid and time-dependent Rydberg state with a Rabi
frequency $\sqrt2\Omega$, such that there is no phase error whenever the state
returns to the ground state. We study two applications of this method. First,
it is possible to faithfully transfer the atomic state between a hyperfine
ground state $|1\rangle$ and Rydberg states $|r_{1(2)}\rangle$ with no {\it
gap} time between the excitation and deexcitation. Second, by adding infrared
laser fields to induce transition between $|r_{1(2)}\rangle$ and a nearby
Rydberg state $|r_3\rangle$ via a largely detuned low-lying intermediate state
in the {\it gap} time, the atom can keep its internal state in the Rydberg
level as well as adjust the population branching in $|r_{1(2)}\rangle$ during
the {\it gap} time. This allows an almost perfect Rydberg deexcitation after
the {\it gap} time, making it possible to recover a high fidelity in the
Rydberg blockade gate. The theory paves the way for high-fidelity quantum
control over neutral Rydberg atoms without cooling qubits to the motional
ground states in optical traps.

(gauged) WZW model and an ""interpolating model"" for non-abelian duality. The
parameters are the WZ level $k$ and the coupling $\lambda$, and the fields are
$g$, valued in a group $G$, and a 2d vector $A_\pm$ in the corresponding
algebra. We formulate the $\lambda$-model as a $\sigma$-model on an extended $G

$\bar{h}$ by $A_+ = h \partial_+ h^{-1}$, $A_- = \bar{h} \partial_-
\bar{h}^{-1}$. Our central observation is that the model on this extended
configuration space is renormalizable without any deformation, with only
$\lambda$ running. This is in contrast to the standard $\sigma$-model found by
integrating out $A_\pm$, whose 2-loop renormalizability is only obtained after
the addition of specific finite local counterterms, resulting in a quantum
deformation of the target space geometry. We compute the 2-loop
$\beta$-function of the $\lambda$-model for general group and symmetric spaces,
and illustrate our results on the examples of $SU(2)/U(1)$ and $SU(2)$. Similar
conclusions apply in the non-abelian dual limit implying that non-abelian

second data release, and it is expected to persist in future Gaia data. In
order to use Gaia parallaxes to infer distances to high precision, we develop a
hierarchical probabilistic model to determine the Gaia parallax zero point
offset along with the calibration of an empirical model for luminosity of red
clump stars by combining astrometric and photometric measurements. Using a
cross-matched sample of red clump stars from the Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2), we report
the parallax zero point offset in DR2 to be $ \varpi_0 = -48 \pm 1~\mu\text{as}
$. We infer the red clump absolute magnitude to be $ -1.622 \pm 0.004 $ in $
K_s $, $ 0.517 \pm 0.004 $ in $ G $, $ -1.019 \pm 0.004 $ in $ J $, and $
-1.516 \pm 0.004 $ in $ H $. The intrinsic scatter of the red clump is $ \sim
0.09 $ mag in $ J $, $ H $ and $ K_s $, or $ \sim 0.17 $ mag in $ G $. We
tailor our models to accommodate more complex analyses such as investigating
the variations of the parallax zero point with each source's observed
magnitude, observed colour, and sky position. In particular, we find
fluctuations of the zero point across the sky to be of order or less than a few
10s of $ \mu\text{as} $.

for Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) systems and real-time traffic management.
This work introduces a novel state-space framework to estimate these demand
flows in an online context. Specifically, we propose to explicitly include
trip-chaining behavior within the state-space formulation, which is solved
using the well-established Kalman Filtering technique. While existing works
already consider structural information and recursive behavior within the
online demand estimation problem, this information has been always considered
at the OD level. In this study, we introduce this structural information by
explicitly representing trip-chaining within the estimation framework. The
advantage is twofold. First, all trips belonging to the same tour can be
jointly calibrated. Second, given the estimation during a certain time
interval, a prediction of the structural deviation over the whole day can be
obtained without the need to run additional simulations. The effectiveness of
the proposed methodology is demonstrated first on a toy network and then on a
large real-world network. Results show that the model improves the prediction
performance with respect to a conventional Kalman Filtering approach. We also
show that, on the basis of the estimation of the morning commute, the model can
be used to predict the evening commute without need of running additional
simulations.

properties of crystalline solids. Their experimental determination is therefore
of crucial importance for technological applications. While the spectral
distribution in energy bands is routinely measured by various techniques, it is
more difficult to access the topological properties of band structures such as
the Berry phase {\gamma}. It is usually thought that measuring the Berry phase
requires applying external electromagnetic forces because these allow realizing
the adiabatic transport on closed trajectories along which quantum mechanical
wave-functions pick up the Berry phase. In graphene, the anomalous quantum Hall
effect results from the Berry phase {\gamma} = {\pi} picked up by massless
relativistic electrons along cyclotron orbits and proves the existence of Dirac
cones. Contradicting this belief, we demonstrate that the Berry phase of
graphene can be measured in absence of any external magnetic field. We observe
edge dislocations in the Friedel oscillations formed at hydrogen atoms
chemisorbed on graphene. Following Nye and Berry in describing these
topological defects as phase singularities of complex fields, we show that the
number of additional wave-fronts in the dislocation is a real space measurement
of the pseudo spin winding, i.e. graphene's Berry phase. Since the electronic
dispersion can also be retrieved from Friedel oscillations, our study
establishes the electronic density as a powerful observable to determine both
the dispersion relation and topological properties of wavefunctions. This could
have profound consequences for the study of the band-structure topology of
relativistic and gapped phases in solids.

with previous investigations that primarily focused on the optical nonlinearity
created by the presence of an atomic ensemble. We report the observation of
distinct non-equilibrium phases of matter of a collective XY spin model with
transverse and longitudinal fields simulated via an ensemble of $\sim 10^6$

generated by coupling a far-detuned optical cavity mode to a narrow optical

probe the different quantum phases that arise from the competition between the

as the dependence of the associated non-equilibrium phase transitions on system
size and initial state preparation. Our observations shed light on
non-equilibrium phases featured in a range of related systems, including
Josephson junctions in superfluid helium, as well as coupled atomic and

  Short-Term Constraints with Co-optimization of Energy and Reserves",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The penetration of variable renewable energy (VRE) in electrical systems has
changed the way the expansion planning is treated. This kind of resource has
great variability in small amounts of time, which makes it important to
represent hourly constraints that require chronology. Besides that, the
generation reserves should also be adjusted in order to capture the
intermittent effect, and since many countries use rapid thermal plants as part
of these reserves, unit commitment and ramp constraint have also become more
significant. In this paper, we propose a MILP expansion planning model that can
represent hourly time steps while maintaining reasonable computational times,
where both investment and operation problems are simultaneously solved. Because
the planning horizons are long (decades), the resolution of the entire horizon
in a single optimization problem would be computationally infeasible for large
real systems, making it necessary, therefore, to apply a horizon decomposition
heuristic in smaller sub-horizons, and use the representation of typical days
and seasons to reduces the size of the problem.

noticed correspondence between the swampland approach in quantum gravity and
geometric flow equations in general relativity, most notably the Ricci flow. We
conjecture that following the gradient flow towards a fixed point, which is at
infinite distance in the space of background metrics, is accompanied by an
infinite tower of states in quantum gravity. In case of the Ricci flow, this
conjecture is in accordance with the generalized distance and AdS distance
conjectures, which were recently discussed in the literature, but it should
also hold for more general background spaces. We argue that the entropy
functionals of gradient flows provide a useful definition of the generalized
distance in the space of background fields. In particular we give evidence that
for the Ricci flow the distance $\Delta$ can be defined in terms of the mean
scalar curvature of the manifold, $\Delta\sim\log \bar R$. For a more general
gradient flow, the distance functional also depends on the string coupling
constant.
  In the second part of the paper we will apply the generalized distance
conjecture to gravity theories with higher curvature interactions, like higher
derivative $R^2$ and $W^2$ terms. We will show that going to the weak coupling
limit of the higher derivative terms corresponds to the infinite distance limit
in metric space and hence this limit must be accompanied by an infinite tower
of light states. For the case of the $R^2$ or $W^2$ couplings, this limit
corresponds to the limit of a small cosmological constant or, respectively, to
a light additional spin-two field in gravity. In general we see that the limit
of small higher curvature couplings belongs to the swampland in quantum
gravity, just like the limit of a small $U(1)$ gauge coupling belongs to the
swampland as well.

due to the high-level of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources penetration,
inside the expansion planning model. The increase in the insertion of this kind
of energy source will also bring an increase in the reserve requirements. A
higher requirement will be translated into additional costs to the system since
the system operator will need to allocate generators for reserve purposes. The
VRE sources implicitly cause these costs, so besides the investment cost, the
expansion planning models should consider those costs on the expansion decision
process. The methodology proposed here aims to provide a probabilistic and
dynamic evaluation of the forecast errors of VRE sources generation,
translating these errors into the system's requirement reserve. This evaluation
is done inside the expansion planning optimization model, treating the reserve
requirement as an endogenous variable. Finally, a real case study of the
Mexican system is presented, so that we can analyze the results of the
methodology and the impacts of considering the reserve requirement along with
the expansion planning decision.

glass-forming material solidifies upon supercooling. The degree of fragility
carries important implications for the functionality and processability of a
material, as well as for our fundamental understanding of the glass transition.
However, the microstructural properties underlying fragility still remain
poorly understood. Here, we explain the microstructure-fragility link in
vitrimeric networks, a novel type of high-performance polymers with unique
bond-swapping functionality and unusual glass-forming behavior. Our results are
gained from coarse-grained computer simulations and first-principles
Mode-Coupling Theory (MCT) of star-polymer vitrimers. We first demonstrate that
the vitrimer fragility can be tuned over an unprecedentedly broad range, from
fragile to strong and even superstrong behavior, by decreasing the bulk
density. Remarkably, this entire phenomenology can be reproduced by microscopic
MCT, thus challenging the conventional belief that existing first-principles
theories cannot account for non-fragile behaviors. Our MCT analysis allows us
to rationally identify the microstructural origin of the fragile-to-superstrong
crossover, which is rooted in the sensitivity of the static structure factor to
temperature variations. On the molecular scale, this behavior stems from a
change in dominant length scales, switching from repulsive excluded-volume
interactions to intrachain attractions as the vitrimer density decreases.
Finally, we develop a simplified schematic MCT model which corroborates our
microscopically-founded conclusions and which unites our findings with earlier
MCT studies. Our work sheds new light on the elusive structure-fragility link
in glass-forming matter, and provides a first-principles-based platform for
designing novel amorphous materials with an on-demand dynamic response.

gravity, primarily in the context of deparametrized models, in which a scalar
field is taken as a physical time variable for the dynamics of the
gravitational field. The dynamics of the quantum states of the gravitational
field is then generated directly by a physical Hamiltonian operator, instead of
being implicitly defined through the kernel of a Hamiltonian constraint.
  We introduce a new construction of a Hamiltonian operator for loop quantum
gravity, which has both mathematical and practical advantages in comparison to
earlier proposals. Most importantly, the new Hamiltonian can be constructed as
a symmetric operator, and is therefore a mathematically consistent candidate
for a generator of physical time evolution in deparametrized models. We develop
methods for approximately evaluating the dynamics generated by a given physical
Hamiltonian, even if an exact solution to the eigenvalue problem of the
Hamiltonian cannot be achieved. We also introduce a new representation for
intertwiners in loop quantum gravity, based on projecting intertwiners onto
coherent states of angular momentum, and in which intertwiners are represented
as polynomials of certain complex variables, and operators in loop quantum
gravity are expressed as differential operators acting on these variables.
  In addition to reviewing the results of the author's scientific work, this
thesis also gives a thorough introduction to the basic framework of canonical
loop quantum gravity, and a self-contained presentation of the graphical
formalism for SU(2) recoupling theory, which is the invaluable tool for
performing practical calculations in loop quantum gravity. The author therefore

as the largest noise level such that the quantum capacity of the channel

correction code for noise modeled by that channel. Discretizing the
single-qubit errors leads to the important family of Pauli quantum channels;
curiously, multipartite entangled states can increase the threshold of these
channels beyond the so-called hashing bound, an effect termed superadditivity
of coherent information. In this work, we divide the simplex of Pauli channels
into one-parameter families and compute numerical lower bounds on their error
thresholds. We find substantial increases of error thresholds relative to the
hashing bound for large regions in the Pauli simplex corresponding to biased
noise, which is a realistic noise model in promising quantum computing
architectures. The error thresholds are computed on the family of graph states,
a special type of stabilizer state. In order to determine the coherent
information of a graph state, we devise an algorithm that exploits the
symmetries of the underlying graph, resulting in a substantial computational
speed-up. This algorithm uses tools from computational group theory and allows
us to consider symmetric graph states on a large number of vertices. Our
algorithm works particularly well for repetition codes and concatenated
repetition codes (or cat codes), for which our results provide the first
comprehensive study of superadditivity for arbitrary Pauli channels. In
addition, we identify a novel family of quantum codes based on tree graphs. The
error thresholds of these tree graph states outperform repetition and cat codes
in large regions of the Pauli simplex, and hence form a new code family with
desirable error correction properties.

assessed through intensive Monte Carlo simulations. However, several
applications, like code-based cryptography, need guaranteed low values of the
error rate, which are infeasible to assess through simulations, thus requiring
the development of theoretical models for the error rate of these codes under
iterative decoding. Some models of this type already exist, but become
computationally intractable for parameters of practical interest. Other
approaches approximate the code ensemble behaviour through some assumptions,
which may not hold true for a specific code. We propose a theoretical analysis
of the error correction capability of LDPC and MDPC codes that allows deriving
tight bounds on the error rate at the output of parallel bit-flipping decoders.
Special attention is devoted to the case of codes with small girth; moreover,
single-iteration decoding is investigated through a rigorous approach, which
does not require any assumption and hence results in a guaranteed error
correction capability for any single code. We show an example of application of
the new bound to the context of code-based cryptography, where guaranteed error

Models (GLMs) in the Non-interactive Local Differential Privacy (NLDP) model.
Different from its classical setting, our model allows the server to access
some additional public but unlabeled data. In the first part of the paper we
focus on GLMs. Specifically, we first consider the case where each data record
is i.i.d. sampled from a zero-mean multivariate Gaussian distribution.
Motivated by the Stein's lemma, we present an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-NLDP
algorithm for
  GLMs. Moreover, the sample complexity of public and private data for the
algorithm to achieve an $\ell_2$-norm estimation error of $\alpha$ (with high
probability) is ${O}(p \alpha^{-2})$ and
$\tilde{O}(p^3\alpha^{-2}\epsilon^{-2})$ respectively, where $p$ is the
dimension of the feature vector. This is a significant improvement over the
previously known exponential or quasi-polynomial in $\alpha^{-1}$, or
exponential in $p$ sample complexities of GLMs with no public data. Then we
consider a more general setting where each data record is i.i.d. sampled from
some sub-Gaussian distribution with bounded $\ell_1$-norm. Based on a variant
of Stein's lemma, we propose an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-NLDP algorithm for
  GLMs whose sample complexity of public and private data to achieve an
$\ell_\infty$-norm estimation error of $\alpha$ is ${O}(p^2\alpha^{-2})$ and
$\tilde{O}(p^2\alpha^{-2}\epsilon^{-2})$ respectively, under some mild
assumptions and if $\alpha$ is not too small ({\em i.e.,} $\alpha\geq
\Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{p}})$). In the second part of the paper, we extend our
idea to the problem of estimating non-linear regressions and show similar
results as in GLMs for both multivariate Gaussian and sub-Gaussian cases.
Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms through experiments

number of likelihoods using a range of Galactic sky masks and different methods
of temperature foreground cleaning. Our most powerful likelihood uses 80
percent of the sky in temperature and polarization. Our results show that the
six-parameter LCDM cosmology provides an excellent fit to the Planck data.
There is no evidence for statistically significant internal tensions in the
Planck TT, TE and EE spectra computed for different frequency combinations. We
present evidence that the tendencies for the Planck temperature power spectra
to favour a lensing amplitude A_L>1 and positive spatial curvature are caused
by statistical fluctuations in the temperature power spectra. Using our
statistically most powerful likelihood, we find that the A_L parameter differs
from unity at no more than the 2.2 sigma level. We find no evidence for
anomalous shifts in cosmological parameters with multipole range. In fact, we
show that the combined TTTEEE likelihood over the restricted multipole range
2-800 gives cosmological parameters for the base LCDM cosmology that are very
close to those derived from the full multipole range 2-2500. We present revised
constraints on a few extensions of the base LCDM cosmology, focussing on the
sum of neutrino masses, number of relativistic species and the tensor-scalar
ratio. The results presented here show that the Planck data are remarkably
consistent between detector-sets, frequencies and sky area. We find no evidence
in our analysis that cosmological parameters determined from the CamSpec
likelihood are affected to any significant degree by systematic errors in the
Planck data (abridged).

permeability and capillary pressure-saturation functions show a high

Amott-Harvey or USBM (United States Bureau of Mines) by capillary pressure
drainage and imbibition cycles. At the pore-scale, the concept of contact angle
is used, which until recently was not experimentally possible to determine
within an opaque porous medium. Recent progress on measurements of pore-scale
contact angles by X-ray computed micro-tomography has therefore attracted
significant attention in various research communities. In this work, the
Gauss-Bonnet theorem is applied to provide a direct link between capillary
pressure saturation $P_c(S_w)$ data and measured distributions of pore-scale
contact angles. We propose that the wetting state of a porous medium can be
described in terms of geometrical arguments that constrain the morphological
state of immiscible fluids. The constraint describes the range of possible
contact angles and interfacial curvatures that can exist for a given system. We
present measurements in a tested sandstone for which the USBM index,
$P_c(S_w)$, and pore-scale contact angles are measured. Additional studies are
also performed using two-phase Lattice Boltzmann simulations to test a wider
range of wetting conditions. We show that mean pore-scale contact angle
measurements can be predicted from petrophysical data within a few differences.
This provides a general framework on how continuum-scale data can be used to
describe the geometrical state of fluids within porous media.

unexpected morphologies that are not fully explained by classical local
equilibrium thermodynamics. Annealing focal conic domains can lead to conical
pyramids, changing the sign of the Gaussian curvature, and exposing smectic
layers at the interface. In order to explore the role of the Gaussian curvature
on the stability and evolution of the film-vapor interface, we introduce a
phase field model of a smectic-isotropic system as a first step in the study.
Through asymptotic analysis of the model, we generalize the classical condition
of local equilibrium, the Gibbs-Thomson equation, to include contributions from
surface bending and torsion, and a dependence on the layer orientation at the
interface. A full numerical solution of the phase field model is then used to
study the evolution of focal conic structures in smectic domains in contact
with the isotropic phase via local evaporation and condensation of smectic
layers. As in experiments, numerical solutions show that pyramidal structures
emerge near the center of the focal conic owing to evaporation of adjacent
smectic planes and to their orientation relative to the interface. Near the
center of the focal conic domain, a correct description of the motion of the
interface requires the additional curvature terms obtained in the asymptotic
analysis, thus clarifying the limitations in modeling motion of hyperbolic
surfaces solely driven by mean curvature.

fibrin as a biopolymer model system with controllable pore size, measurements
of the full time-dependent normal force during compression are found to be in
excellent agreement with the theoretical calculations. The inferred elastic
response of large-pore ($\mathrm{\mu m}$) fibrin networks depends on the strain

Phenomenologically extending the calculated normal force into the regime of
nonlinear elasticity, we find strain-stiffening of small-pore (sub-$\mathrm{\mu

gel-plate interface that depends on the polymer concentration in a power-law

approximately inverse squared with the fibrin concentration, implying with a

$(\pi,W,\sigma)$ of the empirical density, the empirical current, and the
empirical jump rate of the ZRP satisfies the continuity equation
$\partial_t\pi=-{\rm{div}}W$ in the sense of distributions. Here
$(\pi_t)_{t\geq 0}$ is a $w^*$-continuous curve of finite non-negative measures
on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, $\sigma_t\in H^1(\mathbb{T}^d)$ and
$W_t=-\nabla\sigma_t$ is a vector-valued measure that is absolutely continuous
with respect to the Lebesgue measure, for all almost all $t\geq 0$. In order to
obtain a closed equation we propose a generalization of Young measures and we
prove that for symmetric ZRPs on the torus, the hydrodynamic limit of the
density is a generalized Young-measure-valued weak solution
$\boldsymbol{\pi}=(\boldsymbol{\pi}_t)_{t\geq 0}$ to a saturated filtration
equation $\partial_t\boldsymbol{\pi}=\Delta\Phi(\boldsymbol{\pi})$. Furthermore
we prove a one-sided two-blocks estimate and we give an equivalent criterion
for its validity. Assuming the validity of the two-blocks estimate one obtains
the equation $\partial_t\pi=\Delta\Phi(\pi^{ac})$ for the empirical density,

PosteriorGram (PPG) to acoustic features for multiple speakers. It is
conditioned on a speaker i-vector to generate the desired target voice. We
validated the idea between English and Mandarin languages in objective and

double amplitudes are treated conventionally, and for the triple amplitudes
tensor we employ the Tucker-3 compression formula, $t_{ijk}^{abc} \approx
t_{XYZ} \,U^X_{ai}\,U^Y_{bj} \,U^Z_{ck}$. The auxiliary quantities $U^X_{ai}$
come from singular value decomposition (SVD) of an approximate triple
amplitudes tensor based on perturbation theory. The efficiency of the proposed
method relies on an observation that the dimension of the ""compressed"" tensor
$t_{XYZ}$ sufficient to deliver a constant relative accuracy of the correlation
energy grows only linearly with the size of the system, $N$. This fact,
combined with proper factorization of the coupled-cluster equations, leads to
practically $N^6$ scaling of the computational costs of the proposed method, as
illustrated numerically for linear alkanes with increasing chain length. This
constitutes a considerable improvement over the $N^8$ scaling of the
conventional (uncompressed) CCSDT theory. The accuracy of the proposed method
is verified by benchmark calculations of total and relative energies for
several small molecular systems and comparison with the exact CCSDT method. The
accuracy levels of 1 kJ/mol are easily achievable with reasonable SVD subspace
size, and even more demanding levels of accuracy can be reached with a
considerable reduction of the computational costs. Extensions of the proposed
method to include higher excitations are briefly discussed, along with possible

based on our analysis on the combined datasets of two enterprises, our results
confirm the general consensus that AV-only solutions are not enough for
real-time defenses in enterprise settings because on average 40% of the malware
samples, when first appeared, are not detected by most AVs on VirusTotal or not
uploaded to VT at all (i.e., never seen in the wild yet). Moreover, our
analysis also shows that enterprise users transfer documents more than
executables and other types of files. Therefore, attackers embed malicious
codes into documents to download and install the actual malicious payload
instead of sending malicious payload directly or using vulnerability exploits.
Moreover, we also found that financial matters (e.g., purchase orders and
invoices) are still the most common subject seen in Business Email Compromise
(BEC) scams that aim to trick employees. Finally, based on our analysis on the
timestamps of captured malware samples, we found that 93% of the malware
samples were delivered on weekdays. Our further analysis also showed that while
the malware samples that require user interaction such as macro-based malware
samples have been captured during the working hours of the employees, the
massive malware attacks are triggered during the off-times of the employees to
be able to silently spread over the networks.

the spectral efficiency and enable massive connectivity in 5G and future
wireless networks. In contrast to orthogonal schemes, such as OFDMA, NOMA
multiplexes several users on the same frequency and time resource. Joint
subcarrier and power allocation problems (JSPA) in NOMA are NP-hard to solve in
general. In this family of problems, we consider the weighted sum-rate (WSR)
objective function as it can achieve various tradeoffs between sum-rate
performance and user fairness. Because of JSPA's intractability, a common
approach in the literature is to solve separately the power control and
subcarrier allocation (also known as user selection) problems, therefore
achieving sub-optimal result. In this work, we first improve the computational
complexity of existing single-carrier power control and user selection schemes.
These improved procedures are then used as basic building blocks to design new
algorithms, namely Opt-JSPA, $\varepsilon$-JSPA and Grad-JSPA. Opt-JSPA
computes an optimal solution with lower complexity than current optimal schemes
in the literature. It can be used as a benchmark for optimal WSR performance in
simulations. However, its pseudo-polynomial time complexity remains impractical
for real-world systems with low latency requirements. To further reduce the
complexity, we propose a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme called
$\varepsilon$-JSPA. Since, no approximation has been studied in the literature,
$\varepsilon$-JSPA stands out by allowing to control a tight trade-off between
performance guarantee and complexity. Finally, Grad-JSPA is a heuristic based
on gradient descent. Numerical results show that it achieves near-optimal WSR
with much lower complexity than existing optimal methods.

large scale separation due to turbulence is to simulate only the large scales
and model the unresolved contributions as done in large-eddy simulation (LES).
This paper focuses on two deep learning (DL) strategies, regression and
reconstruction, which are data-driven and promising alternatives to classical
modeling concepts. Using three-dimensional (3-D) forced turbulence direct
numerical simulation (DNS) data, subgrid models are evaluated, which predict
the unresolved part of quantities based on the resolved solution. For
regression, it is shown that feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) are
able to predict the fully-resolved scalar dissipation rate using filtered input
data. It was found that a combination of a large-scale quantity, such as the
filtered passive scalar itself, and a small-scale quantity, such as the
filtered energy dissipation rate, gives the best agreement with the actual DNS
data. Furthermore, a DL network motivated by enhanced super-resolution
generative adversarial networks (ESRGANs) was used to reconstruct
fully-resolved 3-D velocity fields from filtered velocity fields. The energy
spectrum shows very good agreement. As size of scientific data is often in the
order of terabytes or more, DL needs to be combined with high performance

flash drive from Kingston, the user data are encrypted using AES-256 in XTS
mode, and the encryption/decryption is processed by an off-the-shelf SRAM-based

proprietary FPGA bitstream and to the firmware of the underlying ARM CPU. In
our Trojan insertion scenario, the targeted USB flash drive is intercepted

the manipulation of the SPI flash memory content, which contains the FPGA
bitstream as well as the ARM CPU code. The FPGA bitstream manipulation alters

otherwise systems fail and lives are put at risk. Even with the most rigorous
testing it is impossible to test systems using all possible inputs. Complex
software systems will often fail when given novel sets of inputs; thus,
safety-critical systems may behave in unintended, dangerous ways when subject
to inputs combinations that were not seen in development. Safety critical
systems are normally designed to be fault tolerant so they do not fail when
given unexpected inputs.
  Anomaly detection has been proposed as a technique for improving the fault
tolerance of safety-critical systems. Past work, however, has been largely
limited to behavioral parameter thresholds that miss many kinds of system
deviations. Here we propose a novel approach to anomaly detection in
fault-tolerant safety critical systems using patterns of messages between
threads. This approach is based on techniques originally developed for
detecting security violations on systems with UNIX-like system call APIs; here
we show that they can be adapted to the constraints of safety critical
microkernel-based hard real-time systems. We present the design,

the coefficients, multiplying various terms in the equation of interest, differ
greatly in magnitude, if a particular system of units is used. Such is, for
instance, the case of the Population Balance Equations (PBE) proposed to model
the Latex Particles Morphology formation. The obvious way out of this
difficulty is the use of dimensionless scaled quantities, although often the
scaling procedure is not unique. In this paper, we introduce a conceptually new
general approach, called Optimal Scaling (OS). The method is tested on the
known examples from classical and quantum mechanics, and applied to the Latex
Particles Morphology model, where it allows us to reduce the variation of the
relevant coefficients from 49 to just 4 orders of magnitudes. The PBE are then
solved by a novel Generalised Method Of Characteristics, and the OS is shown to
help reduce numerical error, and avoid unphysical behaviour of the solution.
Although inspired by a particular application, the proposed scaling algorithm
is expected find application in a wide range of chemical, physical and
biological problems.

adversarial learning can be used to train models on a higher level of
abstraction in order to increase their robustness to lexical and stylistic
variations.We propose to perform Semantic Parsing with a domain classification
adversarial task without explicit knowledge of the domain. The strategy is
first evaluated on a French corpus of encyclopedic documents, annotated with
FrameNet, in an information retrieval perspective, then on PropBank Semantic
Role Labeling task on the CoNLL-2005 benchmark. We show that adversarial
learning increases all models generalization capabilities both on in and

in the form of heat and convert it back to electricity on demand. The impact of
a number of technical and economic parameters on the profitability of a
self-consumption residential system located in Madrid is assessed. The proposed
solution comprises two kinds of heat stores: a low- or medium-grade heat store
for domestic hot water and space heating, and a high-grade heat store for
combined heat and power generation. Two cases are considered where the energy
that is wasted during the conversion of heat into electricity is employed to
satisfy either the heating demand, or both heating and cooling demands by using
a thermally-driven heat pump. We compare these solutions against a reference
case that relies on the consumption of grid electricity and natural gas and
uses an electrically-driven heat pump for cooling. The results show that, under
relatively favourable conditions, the proposed solution that uses an
electrically-driven heat pump could provide electricity savings in the range of
70-90% with a payback period of 12-15 years, plus an additional 10-20%
reduction in the fuel consumption. Shorter payback periods, lower than 10
years, could be attained by using a highly efficient thermally driven heat
pump, at the expense of increasing the fuel consumption and the greenhouse gas
emissions. Hybridising this solution with solar thermal heating could enable
significant savings on the global emissions, whilst keeping a high amount of
savings in grid electricity (> 70 %) and a reasonably short payback period (<
12 years).

pace over the last two decades, most applications have been developed with
laser pulses at near-IR or visible wavelengths. Recent progress in mid-infrared
(MIR) femtosecond laser source development may create novel capabilities for
material processing. This is because, at high intensities required for such
processing, wavelength tuning to longer wavelengths opens the pathway to a
special regime of laser-solid interactions. Under these conditions, due to the
${\lambda}^2$ scaling, the ponderomotive energy of laser-driven electrons may
significantly exceed photon energy, band gap and electron affinity and can
dominantly drive absorption, resulting in a paradigm shift in the traditional
concepts of ultrafast laser-solid interactions. Irreversible high-intensity
ultrafast MIR laser-solid interactions are of primary interest in this
connection, but they have not been systematically studied so far. To address
this fundamental gap, we performed a detailed experimental investigation of
high-intensity ultrafast modifications of silicon by single femtosecond MIR
pulses (${\lambda}$ = 2.7 - 4.2 ${\mu}$m). Ultrafast melting, interaction with
silicon-oxide surface layer, and ablation of the oxide and crystal surfaces
were ex-situ characterized by scanning electron, atomic-force, and transmission
electron microscopy combined with focused ion-beam milling, electron
diffractometry, and ${\mu}$-Raman spectroscopy. Laser induced damage and
ablation (LIDA) thresholds were measured as functions of laser wavelength. The
traditional theoretical models did not reproduce the wavelength scaling of the
damage thresholds. To address the disagreement, we discuss possible novel
pathways of energy deposition driven by the ponderomotive energy and field
effects characteristic of the MIR wavelength regime.

unambiguous structure of the kinetic part of Hamiltonian for the
position-dependent effective mass (PDEM). Various existing proposals of writing
the viable kinetic part of the Hamiltonian for PDEM, conceptually lack from
first principle calculation. Starting from the first principle calculation, in
this article, we have advocated the proper self-adjoint form of the kinetic
part of Hamiltonian for PDEM. We have proposed that ambiguity of construction
of viable kinetic part for PDEM can be avoided if one takes the care from the
Classical level combination of position and momentum. \\ In the quantum level,
the spatial points do not appear in equivalent footing for the measure of
inertia (mass). This exhibits the existence of an inertia potential. Thus the
new structure of the Kinetic part differs from the existing structure of the
kinetic part of Hamiltonian by providing an extra potential like contribution.
This inertia potential can be absorbed with the external potential and redefine
the known structure of PDEM under this effective potential. This enables us to
apply the existing formalism of quantum mechanics. The coherent state
structures for the newly proposed form of Hamiltonian are provided for a few
simple experimentally important models.

propagation behavior of a one-dimensional periodic multi-stable cellular
material. Wave propagation in these materials is interesting because they
combine the ability of periodic cellular materials to exhibit stop and pass
bands with the ability to dissipate energy through cell-level elastic
instabilities. Here, we use Bloch periodic boundary conditions to compute the
dispersion curves and introduce a new approach for computing wide band
directionality plots. Also, we deconstruct the wave propagation behavior of
this material to identify the contributions from its various structural
elements by progressively building the unit cell, structural element by
element, from a simple, homogeneous, isotropic primitive. Direct integration
time domain analyses of a representative volume element at a few salient
frequencies in the stop and pass bands are used to confirm the existence of
partial band gaps in the response of the cellular material. Insights gained
from the above analyses are then used to explore modifications of the unit cell
that allow the user to tune the band gaps in the response of the material. We
show that this material behaves like a locally resonant material that exhibits
low frequency band gaps for small amplitude planar waves. Moreover, modulating
the geometry or material of the central bar in the unit cell provides a path to
adjust the position of the band gaps in the material response.
