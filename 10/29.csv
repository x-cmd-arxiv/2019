operator in quantum gravity. We will find it is more perceptive alternative to
use affine connections more general than metric compatible connections in
quantum gravity. We will demonstrate this using the canonical quantization
procedure. This is valid irrespective of the presence and nature of sources.
The conventional Palatini and metric-affine formalisms, where the actions are
linear in the scalar curvature with metric and affine connections being the the
independent variables, are not much suitable to construct a source-free theory
of gravity with general affine connections. This is also valid for many
minimally coupled interacting theories where sources only couple with metric by
using the Levi-Civita connections exclusively. We will discuss potential
formalism of affine connections to introduce affine connections more general
than metric compatible connections in gravity. We will also discuss possible
extensions of the actions for this purpose. General affine connections
introduce new fields in gravity besides metric. In this article, we will
consider a simple potential formalism with symmetric affine connections and
symmetric Ricci tensor. Corresponding affine connections introduce two massless
scalar fields. One of these fields contributes a stress-tensor with opposite
sign to the sources of Einstein's equation when we state the equation using the
Levi-Civita connections. This means we have a massless scalar field with
negative stress-tensor in Einstein's equation. This field brings us beyond
strict local Minkowski geometries. These scalar fields can be useful to explain
inflation and dark energy.

increasing EW(Ly-alpha) for EW(Ly-alpha)<100A, but for higher EW(Ly-alpha)>150A
the fesc(Ly-alpha) is nearly constant attaining the value of ~0.25. We find an
anticorrelation between fesc(Ly-alpha) and Vsep, though not as tight as the one

  Estimating Missingness Probabilities Under a Low Nuclear Norm Assumption","Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019)",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Matrix completion is often applied to data with entries missing not at random
(MNAR). For example, consider a recommendation system where users tend to only
reveal ratings for items they like. In this case, a matrix completion method
that relies on entries being revealed at uniformly sampled row and column
indices can yield overly optimistic predictions of unseen user ratings.
Recently, various papers have shown that we can reduce this bias in MNAR matrix
completion if we know the probabilities of different matrix entries being
missing. These probabilities are typically modeled using logistic regression or
naive Bayes, which make strong assumptions and lack guarantees on the accuracy
of the estimated probabilities. In this paper, we suggest a simple approach to
estimating these probabilities that avoids these shortcomings. Our approach
follows from the observation that missingness patterns in real data often
exhibit low nuclear norm structure. We can then estimate the missingness
probabilities by feeding the (always fully-observed) binary matrix specifying
which entries are revealed or missing to an existing nuclear-norm-constrained
matrix completion algorithm by Davenport et al. [2014]. Thus, we tackle MNAR
matrix completion by solving a different matrix completion problem first that
recovers missingness probabilities. We establish finite-sample error bounds for
how accurate these probability estimates are and how well these estimates
debias standard matrix completion losses for the original matrix to be
completed. Our experiments show that the proposed debiasing strategy can
improve a variety of existing matrix completion algorithms, and achieves
downstream matrix completion accuracy at least as good as logistic regression
and naive Bayes debiasing baselines that require additional auxiliary
information.

When the overall objective is that of network inference, at possibly different

scattering (SRS), which has recently proved to be a key technique to provide
label free images of chemical bonds in biological and medical samples. Contrary
to most microscopy techniques, which detect a weak photon flux resulting from
light matter interactions, SRS is a pump-probe scheme that works in the high
flux regime and happens as a weak modulation ($10^{-4}-10^{-6}$) in a strong
laser field. As a result, laser noise is a key issue in SRS detection. This
practical tutorial provides the experimentalists with the tools required to
assess the amount of noise and the ultimate SRS detection limit in a
conventional lock-in-based SRS system. We first define the quantities that are
relevant when discussing intensity noise, and illustrate them through a
conventional model of light detection by a photodiode. Stimulated Raman
Scattering is then introduced in its lock-in-based implementation, and the
model presented is adapted in this particular case. The power spectral density
(PSD), relative intensity noise (RIN), signal to noise ratio (SNR), and
sensitivity of the system are derived and discussed. Two complementary methods
are presented that allow measurement of the RIN and assessment of the
performance of a SRS system. Such measurements are illustrated on two
commercial laser systems. Finally, the consequences of noise in SRS are
discussed, and future developments are suggested. The presentation is made
simple enough for under-graduated, graduated students, and newcomers in the
field of stimulated Raman, and more generally in pump-probe based schemes.

received much attention lately due to its ability to provide a robustness
interpretation of various learning models. Moreover, many of the DRO problems
that arise in the learning context admits exact convex reformulations and hence
can be tackled by off-the-shelf solvers. Nevertheless, the use of such solvers
severely limits the applicability of DRO in large-scale learning problems, as
they often rely on general purpose interior-point algorithms. On the other
hand, there are very few works that attempt to develop fast iterative methods
to solve these DRO problems, which typically possess complicated structures. In
this paper, we take a first step towards resolving the above difficulty by
developing a first-order algorithmic framework for tackling a class of
Wasserstein distance-based distributionally robust logistic regression (DRLR)
problem. Specifically, we propose a novel linearized proximal ADMM to solve the
DRLR problem, whose objective is convex but consists of a smooth term plus two
non-separable non-smooth terms. We prove that our method enjoys a sublinear
convergence rate. Furthermore, we conduct three different experiments to show
its superb performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. In
particular, our method can achieve the same accuracy up to 800+ times faster
than the standard off-the-shelf solver.

reaction rates in fluid dynamics, and can also be used to identify regions of

detailed properties of the velocity field, such as its derivatives, that are
hard to measure directly. When an experiment gives only sparse trajectory data,
it is natural to encode planar trajectories as mathematical braids, which are
topological objects that contain information on the mixing characteristics of
the flow, in particular through their action on topological loops. We test such
braid methods on an experimental system, the rotor-oscillator flow, which is
well-described by a theoretical model. We conduct a series of laboratory
experiments to collect particle tracking and particle image velocimetry data,
and use the particle tracks to identify regions of coherence within the flow
that match the results obtained from the model velocity field. We then use the
data to estimate growth rates of material interface, using both the braid
approach and numerical simulations. The interface growth rates follow similar
qualitative trends in both the experiment and model, but have significant
quantitative differences, suggesting that the two are not as similar as first
seems. Our results shows that there are challenges in using the braid approach
to analyze data, in particular the need for long trajectories, but that these

diversity in gathering and processing RSS measurements mitigates the loss of
localization accuracy due to the adoption of low-complexity sensors. The UAVs
plan their trajectories on-the-fly and in a distributed fashion. The collected

subject to latency. Since not all the paths are equal in terms of information
gathering rewards, the motion planning is formulated as a minimization of the
uncertainty of the source position under UAV kinematic and anti-collision

takes into account non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channel conditions as well as

This is done in two steps. First, we show that, if eigenvalues are
uncorrelated, the distribution of complex spacing ratios is flat within the
unit circle, whereas random matrices show a strong angular dependence in
addition to the usual level repulsion. The universal fluctuations of Gaussian
Unitary and Ginibre Unitary universality classes in the large-matrix-size limit

latter case, we introduce the Toric Unitary Ensemble, characterized by a flat
joint eigenvalue distribution on the two-torus. Second, we study different
physical situations where nonhermitian matrices arise: dissipative quantum
systems described by a Lindbladian, non-unitary quantum dynamics described by
nonhermitian Hamiltonians, and classical stochastic processes. We show that
known integrable models have a flat distribution of complex spacing ratios

predictions. Specifically, we were able to clearly distinguish chaotic from
integrable dynamics in boundary-driven dissipative spin-chain Liouvillians and
in the classical asymmetric simple exclusion process and to differentiate

Very few CNe have had DN eruptions within decades of the main CN outburst. The
14 years separating the CN and DN eruptions of V1047 Cen is the shortest of all
instances recorded thus far. Explaining this rapid succession of CN and DN
outbursts in V1047 Cen may be challenging within the framework of standard
theories for DN outbursts. Following a CN eruption, the mass accretion rate is
believed to remain high $(\dot{M}\sim10^{-8}$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1})$ for a few
centuries, due to the irradiation of the secondary star by the still-hot
surface of the white dwarf. Thus a DN eruption is not expected to occur during
this high mass accretion phase as DN outbursts, which result from thermal
instabilities in the accretion disk, and arise during a regime of low mass
accretion rate $(\dot{M}\sim10^{-10}$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1})$. Here we present
near-infrared spectroscopy to show that the present outburst is most likely a
DN eruption, and discuss the possible reasons for its early occurrence. Even if
the present re-brightening is later shown to be due to a cause other than a DN
outburst, the present study provides invaluable documentation of this unusual

has better dependence on the input dimensionality if the target function

prioritizing features, automating the selection process is preferred since it
requires laborious efforts with intensive analysis otherwise. However, it is
not an easy task to enable the automation due to several reasons. First,
selection techniques often need a condition to terminate the reduction process,
for example, by using a threshold or the number of features to stop, and
searching an adequate stopping condition is highly challenging. Second, it is
uncertain that the reduced variable set would work well; our preliminary
experimental result shows that well-known selection techniques produce
different sets of variables as a result of reduction (even with the same
termination condition), and it is hard to estimate which of them would work the
best in future testing. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential power of
our approach to the automation of selection process that incorporates
well-known selection methods identifying important variables. Our experimental

theoretical side, we identify two phenomena preventing efficient exploration in
existing state-of-the-art algorithms such as Soft Actor Critic. First,
combining a greedy actor update with a pessimistic estimate of the critic leads
to the avoidance of actions that the agent does not know about, a phenomenon we
call pessimistic underexploration. Second, current algorithms are directionally
uninformed, sampling actions with equal probability in opposite directions from
the current mean. This is wasteful, since we typically need actions taken along
certain directions much more than others. To address both of these phenomena,
we introduce a new algorithm, Optimistic Actor Critic, which approximates a
lower and upper confidence bound on the state-action value function. This
allows us to apply the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty to
perform directed exploration using the upper bound while still using the lower
bound to avoid overestimation. We evaluate OAC in several challenging
continuous control tasks, achieving state-of the art sample efficiency.

  We show that the complex excess variance spectrum of IRAS 13224-3809 can be

rectifiability in sub-Riemannian geometry. In particular, we study which kind
of results can be expected for smooth hypersurfaces in Carnot groups. Our main
contribution will be a consequence of the following result: there exists a
$C^{\infty}$ hypersurface $S$ without characteristic points that has
uncountably many pairwise non-isomorphic tangent groups on every
positive-measure subset. The example is found in a Carnot group of topological
dimension 8, it has Hausdorff dimension 12 and so we use on it the Hausdorff
measure $\mathcal{H}^{12}$. As a consequence, we show that for every Carnot
group of Hausdorff dimension 12, any Lipschitz map defined on a subset of it
with values in $S$ has $\mathcal{H}^{12}$-null image. In particular, we deduce
that this smooth hypersurface cannot be Lipschitz parametrizable by countably
many maps each defined on some subset of some Carnot group of Hausdorff
dimension $12$. As main consequence we have that a notion of rectifiability
proposed by S.Pauls is not equivalent to one proposed by B.Franchi, R.Serapioni
and F.Serra Cassano, at least for arbitrary Carnot groups. In addition, we show
that, given a subset $U$ of a homogeneous subgroup of Hausdorff dimension $12$
of a Carnot group, every bi-Lipschitz map $f:U\to S$ satisfies
$\mathcal{H}^{12}(f(U))=0$. Finally, we prove that such an example does not
exist in Heisenberg groups: we prove that all $C^{\infty}$-hypersurfaces in
$\mathbb H^n$ with $n\geq 2$ are countably $\mathbb{H}^{n-1}\times\mathbb
R$-rectifiabile according to Pauls' definition, even with bi-Lipschitz maps.

object-centric perception, prediction, and planning (OP3), which to the best of
our knowledge is the first fully probabilistic entity-centric dynamic latent
variable framework for model-based reinforcement learning that acquires entity
representations from raw visual observations without supervision and uses them
to predict and plan. OP3 enforces entity-abstraction -- symmetric processing of
each entity representation with the same locally-scoped function -- which
enables it to scale to model different numbers and configurations of objects
from those in training. Our approach to solving the key technical challenge of
grounding these entity representations to actual objects in the environment is
to frame this variable binding problem as an inference problem, and we develop
an interactive inference algorithm that uses temporal continuity and
interactive feedback to bind information about object properties to the entity
variables. On block-stacking tasks, OP3 generalizes to novel block
configurations and more objects than observed during training, outperforming an
oracle model that assumes access to object supervision and achieving two to
three times better accuracy than a state-of-the-art video prediction model that

Whereas in the large mass limit we observe Ne\'el-like vortex-antivortex and

striped phases into a disordered phase whose properties resemble those at the

on ladders by boundary Haldane-like properties, such as vanishing parity and
finite string ordering. Moreover, from studies of the string tension between

communication (information bits) constraints. While testing independence is
very relevant in various applications, distributed independence test is
particularly useful for event detection in sensor networks where data
correlation often occurs among observations of devices in the presence of a
signal of interest. By focusing on the case of two devices because of their
tractability, we begin by investigating conditions on Type I error probability
restrictions under which the minimum Type II error admits an exponential
behavior with the sample size. Then, we study the finite sample-size regime of
this problem. We derive new upper and lower bounds for the gap between the
minimum Type II error and its exponential approximation under different setups,
including restrictions imposed on the vanishing Type I error probability. Our
theoretical results shed light on the sample-size regimes at which
approximations of the Type II error probability via error exponents became
informative enough in the sense of predicting well the actual error
probability. We finally discuss an application of our results where the gap is
evaluated numerically, and we show that exponential approximations are not only
tractable but also a valuable proxy for the Type II probability of error in the
finite-length regime.

construct a training dataset that matches a target task without compromising on
privacy of the data sources. To this end, we consider the following distributed
data summarizataion problem. Given K private source datasets denoted by
$[D_i]_{i\in [K]}$ and a small target validation set $D_v$, which may involve a
considerable covariate shift with respect to the sources, compute a summary
dataset $D_s\subseteq \bigcup_{i\in [K]} D_i$ such that its statistical
distance from the validation dataset $D_v$ is minimized. We use the popular
Maximum Mean Discrepancy as the measure of statistical distance. The
non-private problem has received considerable attention in prior art, for
example in prototype selection (Kim et al., NIPS 2016). Our work is the first
to obtain strong differential privacy guarantees while ensuring the quality
guarantees of the non-private version. We study this problem in a Parsimonious
Curator Privacy Model, where a trusted curator coordinates the summarization
process while minimizing the amount of private information accessed. Our
central result is a novel protocol that (a) ensures the curator accesses at
most $O(K^{\frac{1}{3}}|D_s| + |D_v|)$ points (b) has formal privacy guarantees
on the leakage of information between the data owners and (c) closely matches
the best known non-private greedy algorithm. Our protocol uses two hash

second leverages state of the art differential privacy mechanisms. We introduce

describe evaporating black holes. The systems we consider are boundary
conformal field theories for which the number of local degrees of freedom on
the boundary ($c_{bdy}$) is large compared to the number of local degrees of
freedom in the bulk CFT ($c_{bulk}$). We consider states where the boundary
degrees of freedom on their own would describe an equilibrium black hole, but
the coupling to the bulk CFT degrees of freedom allows this black hole to
evaporate. The Page time for the black hole is controlled by the ratio
$c_{bdy}/c_{bulk}$. Using both holographic calculations and direct CFT
calculations, we study the evolution of the entanglement entropy for the subset
of the radiation system (i.e. the bulk CFT) at a distance $d > a$ from the
boundary. We find that the entanglement entropy for this subsystem increases
until time $a + t_{Page}$ and then undergoes a phase transition after which the
entanglement wedge of the radiation system includes the black hole interior.
Remarkably, this occurs even if the radiation system is initially at the same
temperature as the black hole so that the two are in thermal equilibrium. In
this case, even though the black hole does not lose energy, it ""radiates""
information through interaction with the radiation system until the radiation
system contains enough information to reconstruct the black hole interior.

solving the problem of phase retrieval. First, a spectral technique is used to
obtain a constant-error initial estimate, following which, the estimate is
refined to arbitrary precision by first-order optimization of a non-convex loss
function. Numerical experiments, however, seem to suggest that simply running
the iterative schemes from a random initialization may also lead to
convergence, albeit at the cost of slightly higher sample complexity. In this
paper, we prove that, in fact, constant step size online stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) converges from arbitrary initializations for the non-smooth,
non-convex amplitude squared loss objective. In this setting, online SGD is
also equivalent to the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm from numerical analysis.
Our analysis can easily be generalized to other single index models. It also
makes use of new ideas from stochastic process theory, including the notion of
a summary state space, which we believe will be of use for the broader field of
non-convex optimization.

transformations to the sentences of source documents. The factual consistency
model is then trained jointly for three tasks: 1) identify whether sentences
remain factually consistent after transformation, 2) extract a span in the
source documents to support the consistency prediction, 3) extract a span in
the summary sentence that is inconsistent if one exists. Transferring this
model to summaries generated by several state-of-the art models reveals that
this highly scalable approach substantially outperforms previous models,
including those trained with strong supervision using standard datasets for
natural language inference and fact checking. Additionally, human evaluation
shows that the auxiliary span extraction tasks provide useful assistance in the

hierarchical triple system, can extract energy from the inner binary, inducing
within it a proclivity to merge. Despite previous work on the subject, which
established that it is significant for certain close triple systems, it is
still not a well-understood process. A portion of our ignorance in this regard
stems from our inability to integrate a simulation of this phenomenon into
conventional stellar evolution codes, since full calculations of these tidal
interactions are computationally expensive on stellar evolution timescales.
Thus, to attain a better understanding of how these TTs act on longer
timescales, an empirical expression of its effects as a function of parameters
of the triple system involved is required. In our work, we evaluate the rate at
which TTs extract energy from the inner binary within a series of constructed
hierarchical triple systems under varying parameters, and study the rate at
which the inner binary orbital separation shrinks as a function of those
parameters. We find that this rate varies little with the absolute values of
the masses of the three component objects, but is very sensitive to the mass
ratio of the inner binary $q$, the tertiary radius $R_{\rm 3}$, the inner
binary orbital separation $a_{\rm 1}$, the outer orbital separation $a_{\rm
2}$, and the viscoelastic relaxation time of the tertiary $\tau$. More
specifically, we find that the percentage by which $a_{\rm 1}$ shrinks per unit

that the stability of the LBL fixed points requires a crucial global symmetry,

formation of lobe structure, particle acceleration, and the FR dichotomy,
previous work on HyMoRS has mainly been limited to low-resolution studies,
searches for new candidates, and milliarcsecond-scale VLBI observations of the
core region. In this paper, we use new multi-array configuration Very Large
Array (VLA) observations between 1 and 8 GHz to determine the morphology of
HyMoRS on arcsecond scales and perform the first well-resolved spectral study
of these unusual sources. We find that while the apparent FR I lobe is
centre-brightened, this is the result of a compact acceleration region
resembling a hotspot with a spectrum more consistent with an FR II
(""strong-flavour"") jet. We find that the spectra of the apparent FR I lobes are
not similar to their classical counterparts and are likely the result of
line-of-sight mixing of plasma across a range of spectral ages. We consider
possible mechanisms that could lead to the formation of HyMoRS under such
conditions, including environment asymmetry and restarted sources, concluding
through the use of simple modelling that HyMoRS are the result of orientation
effects on intrinsically FR II sources with lobes non-parallel to the inner
jet.

conduct radiative transfer modeling that includes self-scattering polarization
to constrain the grain size and its distribution. We found that the grain size
and dust scale height are the key parameters for reproducing the radial and
azimuthal distributions of the observed polarization signature. Radial
variation is mainly determined by grain size. The polarization fraction is high
if the particle size is $\sim \lambda/2\pi$; it is low if the particle size is
larger or smaller than this. In contrast, azimuthal variation in polarization
is enhanced if the dust scale height is increased. Based on detailed modeling
of the HD 163296 polarization, we found the following radial variations in the
grain size and dust scale height. The maximum grain size was 140 microns in the
gaps and significantly larger or smaller in the rings. The dust scale height is
less than one-third the gas scale height inside the 70 au ring, and two-thirds
the gas scale height outside the 70 au ring. Furthermore, we constrained the
gas turbulence to be $\alpha\lesssim1.5\times10^{-3}$ in the 50 au gap and
$\alpha\sim 0.015-0.3$ in the 90 au gap. The transition of the turbulence
strength at the boundary of the 70 au ring indicates the existence of a dead

of stellar-mass black holes (BHs). Robust predictions from stellar models are
needed to interpret these. Theory predicts the existence of a gap in the BH
mass distribution because of pair-instability supernova. The maximum BH mass
below the gap is the result of pulsational mass loss. We evolve massive helium
stars through their late hydrodynamical phases of evolution using the
open-source MESA stellar evolution code. We find that the location of the lower
edge of the mass gap at 45$M_\odot$ is remarkably robust against variations in
the metallicity ($\approx 3M_\odot$), the treatment of internal mixing
($\approx 1M_\odot$), stellar wind mass loss ($\approx 4M_\odot$), making it
the most robust predictions for the final stages of massive star evolution. The
reason is that the onset of the instability is dictated by the near-final core
mass, which in turn sets the resulting BH mass. However, varying
$^{12}C\left(\alpha,\gamma\right)^{16}O$ reaction rate within its $1\sigma$
uncertainties shifts the location of the gap between $40M_\odot$ and
$56M_\odot$. We provide updated analytic fits for population synthesis
simulations. Our results imply that the detection of merging BHs can provide
constraints on nuclear astrophysics. Furthermore, the robustness against
metallicity suggests that there is a universal maximum for the location of the
lower edge of the gap, which is insensitive to the formation environment and
redshift for first-generation BHs. This is promising for the possibility to use
the location of the gap as a ""standard siren"" across the Universe.

However, parity is still a conserved quantity in the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian,

a Jaynes-Cummings type system with the addition of a single classical drive. By
shifting the paradigm from simulating a particular model to simulating a

ionizing radiation and kinetic energy. The strength of a WR wind decides the
eventual mass of its remnant, likely a massive black hole. However, despite
their major influence and importance for gravitational wave detection
statistics, WR winds are particularly poorly understood. In this paper, we
introduce the first set of hydrodynamically consistent stellar atmosphere
models for classical WR stars of both the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sequence,
i.e. WC and WN stars, as a function of stellar luminosity-to-mass ratio (or
Eddington Gamma), and metallicity. We demonstrate the inapplicability of the
CAK wind theory for classical WR stars and confirm earlier findings that their
winds are launched at the (hot) iron (Fe) opacity peak. For $\log Z/Z_\odot >
-2$, Fe is also the main accelerator throughout the wind. Contrasting previous
claims of a sharp lower mass-loss limit for WR stars, we obtain a smooth
transition to optically thin winds. Furthermore, we find a strong dependence of
the mass-loss rates on Eddington-$\Gamma$, both at solar and sub-solar
metallicity. Increases in WC carbon and oxygen abundances turn out to slightly
reduce the predicted mass-loss rates. Calculations at subsolar metallicities
indicate that below the metallicity of the SMC, WR mass-loss rates decrease
much faster than previously assumed, potentially allowing for high black hole
masses even in the local universe.

observed exoplanet statistics. So far the theory of migration has focused on
the interaction of planets with an inviscid or viscously evolving disk.
Turbulent viscosity is thought to be the main driver of disk evolution and is
known to affect the migration process. Recently, the topic of wind-driven
accretion is experiencing a renaissance, as evidence is mounting that PPDs may
be less turbulent than previously thought, and 3-D non-ideal MHD modeling of
the wind-launching process is maturing. Aim: We wish to investigate how
wind-driven accretion may affect migration. We aim for a qualitative
exploration of the main effects, rather than a quantitative prediction.
Methods: We perform 2-D hydrodynamic simulations with the FARGO3D code in the
$(r,\phi)$-plane. The vertical coordinate and the launching of the wind are not
treated explicitly. Instead, the torque of the wind onto the disk is treated
using a simple 2-parameter formula treating the wind mass loss rate and the
lever arm. Results: We find that the wind-driven accretion process has a
different way of replenishing the co-orbital region than the viscous accretion.
The former always injects mass from the outer edge of the co-orbital region and
removes mass from the inner edge, while the latter injects or removes mass from
the co-orbital region depending on the radial density gradients in the disk.
The migration behavior can differ very much and under certain conditions it can
drive rapid type-III-like outward migration. We derive an analytic expression
for the parameters under which this outward migration occurs. Conclusion: If
wind-driven accretion plays a role in the secular evolution of PPDs, migration
studies have to include this process as well, because it can strongly affect
the resulting migration rate and direction.

the quantum dot confinement potential is weak, the system behaves as an
effective Wigner crystal with a period determined by the electron average
density with considerable electron hopping throughout the system. For stronger
periodic confinement potentials, however, the system makes a crossover to a
Mott-type strongly correlated ground state where the electrons are completely
localized at the individual dots with little inter-dot tunneling. In between
these two phases, the system is essentially a strongly correlated electron
liquid with inter-site electron hopping constrained by strong Coulomb
interaction. We characterize this Wigner-Mott-liquid quantum crossover with
detailed numerical finite-size diagonalization calculations of the coupled
interacting qubit system, showing that these phases can be smoothly connected
by tuning the system parameters. Experimental feasibility of observing such a
hopping-tuned Wigner-Mott-liquid crossover in currently available semiconductor
quantum dot qubits is discussed. In particular, we connect our theoretical
results to recent quantum-dot-based quantum emulation experiments where
collective Coulomb blockade was demonstrated. One conclusion of our theory is
that currently available realistic quantum dot arrays are unable to explore the

cannot be served upon arrival get dropped, has a long history going back to the
classical Erlang B model. In this paper, we consider the performance benefits
arising from the possibility of deferring customers who cannot be served upon
arrival. Specifically, we consider an Erlang B type loss system where the
system operator can, subject to certain constraints, ask a customer arriving
when all servers are busy, to come back at a specified time in the future. If
the system is still fully loaded when the deferred customer returns, she gets
dropped for good. For such a system, we ask: How should the system operator
determine the rearrival times of the deferred customers based on the state of
the system (which includes those customers already deferred and yet to arrive)?
How does one quantify the performance benefit of such a deferral policy? Our
contributions are as follows. We propose a simple state-dependent policy for
determining the rearrival times of deferred customers. For this policy, we
characterize the long run fraction of customers dropped. We also analyse a
relaxation where the deferral times are bounded in expectation. Via extensive
numerical evaluations, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
state-dependent policies over naive state-independent deferral policies.

their outskirts. However, we find a wide range of stellar ages in their central
regions, and we detect central AGN-like or composite-like activity in roughly
half of the sample galaxies, with the other half consisting of galaxies with
central star-forming emission or emission consistent with old stars. We measure
gradients in gas metallicity and stellar metallicity that are generally flatter
in physical units than those measured for the Milky Way; however, we find far
better agreement with the Milky Way when scaling gradients by galaxies' disc
scale lengths. From this, we argue much of the discrepancy in metallicity

differences in observing perspective also likely to be a factor.

outside the nominal 3:2 mean-motion resonance. They represent a different
outcome of the planet formation process than the solar system, as well as the
vast majority of known exoplanets. We measured the physical and orbital
properties of these planets using photometry from K2, Spitzer, and ground-based
telescopes, along with radial velocities from Keck/HIRES. Through a joint
photodynamical model, we found that the planets have moderate eccentricities of
$e \approx0.20$ and well-aligned apsides $\Delta \varpi \approx 0$ deg. The
planets occupy a strictly non-resonant configuration: the resonant angles
circulate rather than librate. This defies the predictions of standard
formation pathways that invoke convergent or divergent migration, both of which
predict $\Delta \varpi \approx 180$ deg and eccentricities of a few percent or
less. We measured masses of $M_{p,b}$ = 32.4$\pm$1.7 M_E and $M_{p,c}$ =
10.8$\pm$0.6 M_E. Our measurements, with 5% fractional uncertainties, are among
the most precise of any sub-Jovian exoplanet. Mass and size reflect a planet's
core/envelope structure. Despite having a relatively massive core of $M_{core}

and trigger runaway accretion when the envelope mass exceeds that of the core.

intellectual property as training a DNN classifier often requires lots of
resource. Watermarking was recently proposed to protect the intellectual
property of DNN classifiers. However, watermarking suffers from a key
limitation: it sacrifices the utility/accuracy of the model owner's classifier
because it tampers the classifier's training or fine-tuning process. In this
work, we propose IPGuard, the first method to protect intellectual property of
DNN classifiers that provably incurs no accuracy loss for the classifiers. Our
key observation is that a DNN classifier can be uniquely represented by its
classification boundary. Based on this observation, IPGuard extracts some data
points near the classification boundary of the model owner's classifier and
uses them to fingerprint the classifier. A DNN classifier is said to be a
pirated version of the model owner's classifier if they predict the same labels
for most fingerprinting data points. IPGuard is qualitatively different from
watermarking. Specifically, IPGuard extracts fingerprinting data points near
the classification boundary of a classifier that is already trained, while
watermarking embeds watermarks into a classifier during its training or
fine-tuning process. We extensively evaluate IPGuard on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet datasets. Our results show that IPGuard can robustly identify
post-processed versions of the model owner's classifier as pirated versions of
the classifier, and IPGuard can identify classifiers, which are not the model
owner's classifier nor its post-processed versions, as non-pirated versions of
the classifier.

of two modules namely handcrafted safety and dynamically-learned safety. The
handcrafted safety module is a heuristic safety rule based on common driving
practice that ensure a minimum relative gap to a traffic vehicle. On the other
hand, the dynamically-learned safety module is a data-driven safety rule that
learns safety patterns from driving data. Specifically, the dynamically-leaned
safety module incorporates a model lookahead beyond the immediate reward of
reinforcement learning to predict safety longer into the future. If one of the
future states leads to a near-miss or collision, then a negative reward will be
assigned to the reward function to avoid collision and accelerate the learning
process. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework in a
simulation environment with varying traffic density. Our results show the
superior capabilities of the policy enhanced with dynamically-learned safety
module.

regularization techniques originally developed for supervised learning.
However, there are stark differences between supervised learning and RL. We
discuss those differences and propose modifications to existing regularization
techniques in order to better adapt them to RL. In particular, we focus on
regularization techniques relying on the injection of noise into the learned
function, a family that includes some of the most widely used approaches such
as Dropout and Batch Normalization. To adapt them to RL, we propose Selective
Noise Injection (SNI), which maintains the regularizing effect the injected
noise has, while mitigating the adverse effects it has on the gradient quality.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Information Bottleneck (IB) is a
particularly well suited regularization technique for RL as it is effective in
the low-data regime encountered early on in training RL agents. Combining the
IB with SNI, we significantly outperform current state of the art results,
including on the recently proposed generalization benchmark Coinrun.

effects are experimentally allowed, as previously noted in arXiv:1701.09183. We
extend that paper's scope to the CP-violating case, paying attention to the
impact on the decay rate and time-dependent CP-violation in $B_d \to J/\psi
K_S$. We show that quantifiable constraints arise for new physics in either of
the two SM operators, with the uncertain non-perturbative matrix element of the
colour-suppressed operator determined from the data. For new physics in the SM
suppressed coefficient $C^c_1$ we find two perfectly viable, narrow bands of
complex Wilson coefficients. Somewhat curiously, one of them contains a region
where the fitted matrix element for the colour-suppressed operator is in
agreement with naive factorization, contrarily to a widely held belief that
large non-factorizable contributions to $B_d \to J/\psi K_S$ are implied by
experimental data.

physics and material science. Magnetic imaging is a non-invasive tool for
detecting electric current in materials and devices. A two-dimensional current
density can be reconstructed from an image of a single component of the
magnetic field produced by the current. In this work, we approach the
reconstruction problem in the framework of Bayesian inference, i.e. we solve
for the most likely current density given an image obtained by a magnetic
probe. To enforce a sensible current density priors are used to associate a
cost with unphysical features such as pixel-to-pixel oscillations or current
outside the device boundary. Beyond previous work, our approach does not
require analytically tractable priors and therefore creates flexibility to use
priors that have not been explored in the context of current reconstruction.
Here, we implement several such priors that have desirable properties. A
challenging aspect of imposing a prior is choosing the optimal strength. We
describe an empirical way to determine the appropriate strength of the prior.
We test our approach on numerically generated examples. Our code is released in

Euclidean space, which has been shown to incur a large distortion when
embedding real-world graphs with scale-free or hierarchical structure.
Hyperbolic geometry offers an exciting alternative, as it enables embeddings
with much smaller distortion. However, extending GCNs to hyperbolic geometry
presents several unique challenges because it is not clear how to define neural
network operations, such as feature transformation and aggregation, in
hyperbolic space. Furthermore, since input features are often Euclidean, it is
unclear how to transform the features into hyperbolic embeddings with the right
amount of curvature. Here we propose Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural
Network (HGCN), the first inductive hyperbolic GCN that leverages both the
expressiveness of GCNs and hyperbolic geometry to learn inductive node
representations for hierarchical and scale-free graphs. We derive GCN
operations in the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic space and map Euclidean input
features to embeddings in hyperbolic spaces with different trainable curvature
at each layer. Experiments demonstrate that HGCN learns embeddings that
preserve hierarchical structure, and leads to improved performance when
compared to Euclidean analogs, even with very low dimensional embeddings:
compared to state-of-the-art GCNs, HGCN achieves an error reduction of up to
63.1% in ROC AUC for link prediction and of up to 47.5% in F1 score for node
classification, also improving state-of-the art on the Pubmed dataset.

out-of-equilibrium at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The stochastic
dynamics of a particle embedded in such a medium are non-Markovian, given by a
generalized Langevin equation. Due to the non-Markovian nature of the dynamics,
the heat dissipation and the entropy production rate cannot be computed using
the standard methods for Markovian processes. In this work, to calculate heat
dissipation, we use an effective Markov description of the non-Markovian
dynamics, which includes the degrees-of-freedom of the medium. Specifically, we
calculate entropy production and heat dissipation rate for a spherical colloid
in a non-Newtonian medium whose rheology is given by a Maxwell viscoelastic
element in parallel with a viscous fluid element, connected to different
temperature baths. This problem is nonequilibrium for two reasons: the medium
is nonequilibrium due to different effective temperatures of the bath, and the
particle is driven out-of-equilibrium by an external stochastic force. When the
medium is nonequilibrium, the effective non-Markov dynamics of the particle may
lead to a negative value of heat dissipation and entropy production rate. The
positivity is restored when the medium's degree-of-freedom is considered. When
the medium is at equilibrium, and the only nonequilibrium component is the
external driving, the correct dissipation is obtained from the effective
description of the particle.

10 degree wide field of view, meaning bright, well-characterized point source
transits are scarce. This, combined with HERA's redundant sampling of the uv
plane and the modest angular resolution of the Phase I instrument, make
traditional sky-based and self-calibration techniques difficult to implement
with high dynamic range. Nonetheless, in this work we demonstrate calibration
for HERA using point source catalogues and electromagnetic simulations of its
primary beam. We show that unmodeled diffuse flux and instrumental contaminants
can corrupt the gain solutions, and present a gain smoothing approach for
mitigating their impact on the 21 cm power spectrum. We also demonstrate a
hybrid sky and redundant calibration scheme and compare it to pure sky-based
calibration, showing only a marginal improvement to the gain solutions at
intermediate delay scales. Our work suggests that the HERA Phase I system can
be well-calibrated for a foreground-avoidance power spectrum estimator by
applying direction-independent gains with a small set of degrees of freedom

of the weight matrices and the total number of parameters. We also establish
refined generalization bounds with additional norm assumptions, and draw a

consider arise from graphons, which are the most general possible
parameterizations of infinite exchangeable graph models and which are the
central objects of study in the theory of dense graph limits. We give a precise
characterization of the set of pairs of graphons that are indistinguishable by
a GCN with nonlinear activation functions coming from a certain broad class if
its depth is at least logarithmic in the size of the sample graph. This
characterization is in terms of a degree profile closeness property. Outside
this class, a very simple GCN architecture suffices for distinguishability. We
then exhibit a concrete, infinite class of graphons arising from stochastic
block models that are well-separated in terms of cut distance and are
indistinguishable by a GCN. These results theoretically match empirical
observations of several prior works. To prove our results, we exploit a
connection to random walks on graphs. Finally, we give empirical results on

probability distributions, a geometric divergence that is relevant to a wide
range of problems. Over the last decade, two relaxations of optimal transport
have been studied in depth: unbalanced transport, which is robust to the
presence of outliers and can be used when distributions don't have the same
total mass; entropy-regularized transport, which is robust to sampling noise
and lends itself to fast computations using the Sinkhorn algorithm. This paper
combines both lines of work to put robust optimal transport on solid ground.
Our main contribution is a generalization of the Sinkhorn algorithm to
unbalanced transport: our method alternates between the standard Sinkhorn
updates and the pointwise application of a contractive function. This implies
that entropic transport solvers on grid images, point clouds and sampled
distributions can all be modified easily to support unbalanced transport, with
a proof of linear convergence that holds in all settings. We then show how to
use this method to define pseudo-distances on the full space of positive
measures that satisfy key geometric axioms: (unbalanced) Sinkhorn divergences
are differentiable, positive, definite, convex, statistically robust and avoid
any ""entropic bias"" towards a shrinkage of the measures' supports.

may contribute significantly to F$_{10.7}$ variability and that coronal
bremsstrahlung emission accounts for 14.2 $\pm$ 2.1 sfu ($\sim20\%$) of the

relationship to the total F$_{10.7}$ at high activity levels, and this combined
with the observed linearity during low activity yields a continuously

F$_{10.7}$. We find that the bremsstrahlung component fit, along with the Mg II

A beam of $^{20}$Mg was produced using the in-flight method and implanted into

indicate that they are overmassive relative to their host galaxy properties.
Overmassive black holes in these systems present a conflict with the standard
progression of galaxy merger - quasar evolution; an alternative explanation is
that a nuclear concentration of molecular gas driven inward by the merger is
affecting these dynamical black hole mass estimates. We test for the presence
of such gas near the two black holes in NGC 6240 using long-baseline ALMA Band
6 observations (beam size 0""06 $\times$ 0""03 or 30 pc$\times$15 pc). We find
(4.2-9.8) $\times10^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$ and (1.2-7.7) $\times10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$
of molecular gas within the resolution limit of the original black hole mass
measurements for the north and south black holes, respectively. In the south
nucleus, this measurement implies that 6-89% of the original black hole mass
measurement actually comes from molecular gas, resolving the tension in the
original black hole scaling relations. For the north, only 5% to 11% is coming
from molecular gas, suggesting the north black hole is actually overmassive.
Our analysis provides the first measurement of significant molecular gas masses
contaminating dynamical black hole mass measurements. These high central
molecular gas densities further present a challenge to theoretical black hole
accretion prescriptions, which often assume accretion proceeds rapidly through
the central 10 pc.

the nonlinear dependence between a pair of potentially high-dimensional random

the null hypothesis of independence between the two random vectors when only
the sample size or the dimensionality diverges. Yet its asymptotic null
distribution for the more realistic setting when both sample size and

this paper, we fill such a gap and develop central limit theorems and
associated rates of convergence for a rescaled test statistic based on the
bias-corrected distance correlation in high dimensions under some mild
regularity conditions and the null hypothesis. Our new theoretical results
reveal an interesting phenomenon of blessing of dimensionality for
high-dimensional distance correlation inference in the sense that the accuracy
of normal approximation can increase with dimensionality. Moreover, we provide
a general theory on the power analysis under the alternative hypothesis of
dependence, and further justify the capability of the rescaled distance
correlation in capturing the pure nonlinear dependency under moderately high
dimensionality for a certain type of alternative hypothesis. The theoretical
results and finite-sample performance of the rescaled statistic are illustrated
with several simulation examples and a blockchain application.

of the visible Northern sky (~3$\pi$). The transient candidates found in this
survey are announced via public alerts. As a supplementary product ZTF is also
conducting a large spectroscopic campaign: the ZTF Bright Transient Survey
(BTS). The goal of the BTS is to spectroscopically classify all extragalactic
transients brighter than 18.5 mag at peak brightness and immediately announce
those classifications to the public. Extragalactic discoveries from ZTF are
predominantly Supernovae (SNe). The BTS is the largest flux-limited SN survey
to date. Here we present a catalog of the761 SNe that were classified during
the first nine months of the survey (2018 Apr. 1 to 2018 Dec. 31). The BTS SN
catalog contains redshifts based on SN template matching and spectroscopic host
galaxy redshifts when available. Based on this data we perform an analysis of
the redshift completeness of local galaxy catalogs, dubbed as the Redshift
Completeness Fraction (RCF; the number of SN host galaxies with known
spectroscopic redshift prior to SN discovery divided by the total number of SN
hosts). In total, we identify the host galaxies of 512 Type Ia supernovae, 227
of which have known spectroscopic redshifts, yielding an RCF estimate of $44\%
\pm1\%$. We find a steady decrease in the RCF with increasing distance in the
local universe. For z<0.05, or ~200 Mpc, we find RCF=0.6, which has important
ramifications when searching for multimessenger astronomical events. Prospects
for dramatically increasing the RCF are limited to new multi-fiber
spectroscopic instruments, or wide-field narrowband surveys. We find that
existing galaxy redshift catalogs are only $50\%$ complete at $r\approx16.9$
mag. Pushing this limit several magnitudes deeper will pay huge dividends when
searching for electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events.

performance. In this work, we advance this effective learning paradigm towards
a scenario where labeled data are severely limited. More specifically, we
address the problem of graph-based semi-supervised learning in the presence of
severely limited labeled samples, and propose a new framework, called {\em
Shoestring}, that improves the learning performance through semantic transfer
from these very few labeled samples to large numbers of unlabeled samples.
  In particular, our framework learns a metric space in which classification
can be performed by computing the similarity to centroid embedding of each

leverage the semantic knowledge of limited labeled samples as well as their
connectivity patterns with large numbers of unlabeled samples simultaneously.
By combining {\em Shoestring} with graph convolutional networks, label
propagation and their recent label-efficient variations (IGCN and GLP), we are
able to achieve state-of-the-art node classification performance in the
presence of very few labeled samples. In addition, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework on image classification tasks in the few-shot

animal health, humans do not always follow biosecurity protocols. Human
behavioral factors have been shown to influence willingness to follow
biosecurity protocols. Here we show how social cues may affect cooperation with
a biosecurity practice. Participants were immersed in a simulated swine
production facility through a graphical user interface and prompted to make a
decision that addressed their willingness to comply with a biosecurity
practice. We tested the effect of varying three experimental variables: (1) the
risk of acquiring an infection, (2) the delivery method of the infection risk
information (numerical versus graphical), and (3) behavior of an automated
coworker in the facility. We provide evidence that participants changed their
behavior when they observed a simulated worker making a choice to follow or not
follow a biosecurity protocol, even though the simulated worker had no economic
effect on the participants' payouts. These results advance the understanding of
human behavioral effects on biosecurity protocol decisions; demonstrating that
social cues need to be considered by livestock facility managers when

state of our outer Solar System. The population ratios and spatial distribution
of Neptune's resonant populations are direct clues to understanding the history
of our planetary system. The orbital structure of the objects in Neptune's 2:1
mean-motion resonance (\emph{twotinos}) has the potential to be a tracer of
planetary migration processes. Different migration processes produce distinct
architectures, recognizable by well-characterized surveys. However, previous
characterized surveys only discovered a few twotinos, making it impossible to
model the intrinsic twotino population. With a well-designed cadence and nearly
100\% tracking success, the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS)
discovered 838 trans-Neptunian objects, of which 34 are securely twotinos with
well-constrained libration angles and amplitudes. We use the OSSOS twotinos and
the survey characterization parameters via the OSSOS Survey Simulator to
inspect the intrinsic population and orbital distributions of twotino. The
estimated twotino population, 4400$^{+1500}_{-1100}$ with $H_r<8.66$
(diameter$\sim$100km) at 95\% confidence, is consistent with the previous
low-precision estimate. We also constrain the width of the inclination
distribution to a relatively narrow value of $\sigma_i$=6$^\circ$$^{+1}_{-1}$,
and find the eccentricity distribution is consistent with a Gaussian centered
on $e_\mathrm{c}=0.275$ with a width $e_\mathrm{w}=0.06$. We find a
single-slope exponential luminosity function with $\alpha=0.6$ for the
twotinos. Finally, we for the first time meaningfully constrain the fraction of
symmetric twotinos, and the ratio of the leading asymmetric islands; both
fractions are in a range of 0.2--0.6. These measurements rule out certain
theoretical models of Neptune's migration history.

masses only a few times larger than Earth's but radii larger than Neptune,
giving them very low mean densities. All three of the known planets orbiting
the young solar-type star Kepler 51 are super-puffs. The Kepler 51 system
thereby provides an opportunity for a comparative study of the structures and
atmospheres of this mysterious class of planets, which may provide clues about
their formation and evolution. We observed two transits each of Kepler 51b and
51d with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope.
Combining new WFC3 transit times with re-analyzed Kepler data and updated
stellar parameters, we confirmed that all three planets have densities lower
than 0.1 g/cm$^{3}$. We measured the WFC3 transmission spectra to be
featureless between 1.15 and 1.63 $\mu$m, ruling out any variations greater
than 0.6 scale heights (assuming a H/He dominated atmosphere), thus showing no
significant water absorption features. We interpreted the flat spectra as the
result of a high-altitude aerosol layer (pressure $<$3 mbar) on each planet.
Adding this new result to the collection of flat spectra that have been
observed for other sub-Neptune planets, we find support for one of the two
hypotheses introduced by Crossfield and Kreidberg (2017), that planets with
cooler equilibrium temperatures have more high-altitude aerosols. We strongly
disfavor their other hypothesis that the H/He mass fraction drives the

system of differential equations for the figure and the rotation of the body
simultaneously (which is the same system of equations used in Folonier et al.
2018), different from the original one (Ferraz-Mello, 2013, 2015a) in which
rotation and figure were considered separately. The time evolution of the
figure of the body is studied for both the 3/2 and 2/1 spin-orbit resonances.
Moreover, we provide a method to determine the relaxation factor gamma of
non-rigid homogeneous bodies whose endpoint of rotational evolution from tidal
interactions is the 3/2 spin-orbit resonance, provided that (i) an initially
faster rotation is assumed and (ii) no permanent components of the flattenings
of the body existed at the time of the capture in the 3/2 spin-orbit resonance.
The method is applied to Mercury, since it is currently trapped in a 3/2
spin-orbit resonance with its orbital motion and we obtain 4.8 times 10 -8 s -1
lower than gamma lower than 4.8 times 10 -9 s -1 . The equatorial prolateness
and polar oblateness coefficients obtained for Mercury's figure with such range
of values of gamma are the same as the ones given by the Darwin-Kaula model

obtained for such range of gamma with those obtained from MESSENGER's

draw connections to closely related models and compare the PRGDS to these

equivalence of two structures, as it does not reflect all the information in
the distribution that is useful for identification of the underlying structure.
In this paper, we present a general, unified notion of equivalence for linear
Gaussian causal directed graphical models, whether they are cyclic or acyclic.
In our proposed definition of equivalence, two structures are equivalent if
they can generate the same set of data distributions. We also propose a weaker
notion of equivalence called quasi-equivalence, which we show is the extent of
identifiability from observational data. We propose analytic as well as
graphical methods for characterizing the equivalence of two structures.
Additionally, we propose a score-based method for learning the structure from

situations where the domain ontology may change dynamically. Experimental
results demonstrate that our BERT-based model outperforms previous methods by a
large margin, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the standard WoZ 2.0

near-optimal 3D topologies optimized for minimum compliance on a standard PC.
Using an implicit geometry description we derive a single-scale interpretation
of optimal multi-scale designs on a very fine mesh (de-homogenization). By
performing homogenization-based topology optimization, optimal multi-scale
designs are obtained on a relatively coarse mesh resulting in a low
computational cost. As microstructure parameterization we use orthogonal rank-3
microstructures, which are known to be optimal for a single loading case.
Furthermore, a method to get explicit control of the minimum feature size and
complexity of the final shapes will be discussed. Numerical examples show
excellent performance of these fine-scale designs resulting in objective values
similar to the homogenization-based designs. Comparisons with well-established
density-based topology optimization methods show a reduction in computational
cost of 3 orders of magnitude, paving the way for giga-scale designs on a
standard PC.

neural networks (CNNs), enabling end-to-end learning of visual representation.
By generalizing inner product with a bilinear matrix, we propose the neural

Neural similarity naturally generalizes the convolution and enhances
flexibility. Further, we consider the neural similarity learning (NSL) in order
to learn the neural similarity adaptively from training data. Specifically, we
propose two different ways of learning the neural similarity: static NSL and
dynamic NSL. Interestingly, dynamic neural similarity makes the CNN become a
dynamic inference network. By regularizing the bilinear matrix, NSL can be
viewed as learning the shape of kernel and the similarity measure
simultaneously. We further justify the effectiveness of NSL with a theoretical
viewpoint. Most importantly, NSL shows promising performance in visual
recognition and few-shot learning, validating the superiority of NSL over the
inner product-based convolution counterparts.

when bacteria attach to the substrate. Understanding environmental factors
affecting the attachment and the early stages of the biofilm development as
well as the development of active methods of biofilm control are crucial for
many applications. Here we show that biofilm formation is strongly affected by
the hydrodynamics of flows generated by surface waves in layers of bacterial
suspensions. Deterministic wave patterns promote the growth of patterned
biofilms while wave-driven turbulent motion destroys the patterns. The location
of the attached bacteria on a solid substrate differs from the settlement
location of inactive bacteria and of the passive micro-particles: strong
biofilms form under the wave antinodes while passive particles and inactive
bacteria settle under nodal points. By controlling the wave lengths and
horizontal mobility of the wave patterns, one can either shape the biofilm
formation and enhance the biofilm growth, or discourage the formation of
biofilm patterns. The results suggest that the deterministic wave-driven
transport, rather than hydrodynamic forces, determine the preferred location
for the bacterial attachment.

equations with an unknown coefficient called the reflectivity. The solution of
the system models waves (sound, electromagnetic or elastic), and the
reflectivity models unknown scatterers embedded in a smooth and known medium.
The inverse problem is to determine the reflectivity from the time resolved
scattering matrix (the data) measured by an array of sensors. We introduce a
novel inversion method, based on a reduced order model (ROM) of an operator
called wave propagator, because it maps the wave from one time instant to the
next, at interval corresponding to the discrete time sampling of the data. The
wave propagator is unknown in the inverse problem, but the ROM can be computed
directly from the data. By construction, the ROM inherits key properties of the
wave propagator, which facilitate the estimation of the reflectivity. The ROM
was introduced previously and was used for two purposes: (1) to map the
scattering matrix to that corresponding to the single scattering (Born)
approximation and (2) to image i.e., obtain a qualitative estimate of the
support of the reflectivity. Here we study further the ROM and show that it
corresponds to a Galerkin projection of the wave propagator. The Galerkin
framework is useful for proving properties of the ROM that are used in the new
inversion method which seeks a quantitative estimate of the reflectivity.

consists in a shift of the expansion point of the Yang-Mills perturbative
series with the aim of treating the transverse gluons as massive already at
tree-level, while leaving the total action of the theory unchanged. The new
framework will be formulated in the context of pure Yang-Mills theory, where
the lattice data is readily available for comparison and the perturbative
results have been perfected by enforcing the gauge invariance of the analytical
structure of the gluon propagator.

of a continuous magnetic phase transition. Such critical spin fluctuations are
highly correlated and in principle can occur at any time- and length-scales;
they govern critical phenomena and potentially can drive new phases. Although
theoretical studies have been made for decades, direct observation of critical
spin fluctuations remains elusive. The recent discovery of two-dimensional (2D)
layered magnets, in which spin fluctuations significantly modify magnetic
properties as compared to their bulk counterparts and integration into
heterostructures and devices can be easily achieved, provides an ideal platform
to investigate and harness critical spin phenomena. Here we develop a fast and
sensitive magneto-optical imaging microscope to achieve wide-field, real-time
monitoring of critical spin fluctuations in single-layer CrBr3, which is a 2D
ferromagnetic insulator. We track the critical phenomena directly from the
fluctuation correlations and observe both slowing-down dynamics and enhanced
correlation length. Through real-time feedback control of critical spin
fluctuations, we further achieve switching of magnetic states solely by
electrostatic gating without applying a magnetic field or a Joule current. The
ability to directly image and control critical spin fluctuations in 2D magnets
opens up exciting opportunities to explore critical phenomena and develop
applications in nanoscale engines and information science.

Firstly, we employ the active subspace to measure the number of ""active

several thousands to several dozens. This motivates us to change the network
structure and to develop a new and more compact network, referred to as
{ASNet}, that has significantly fewer model parameters. Secondly, we propose
analyzing the vulnerability of a neural network using active subspace and
finding an additive universal adversarial attack vector that can misclassify a
dataset with a high probability. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 show that ASNet
can achieve 23.98$\times$ parameter and 7.30$\times$ flops reduction. The
universal active subspace attack vector can achieve around 20% higher attack

differential privacy, requiring that the outputs of a mechanism (i.e., function
composition of a privacy-preserving mapping and a query) can attain only a few
values while varying the data of an individual (the logarithm of the number of
the distinct values is bounded by the privacy budget). Therefore, the output of
the mechanism is not fully informative of the data of the individuals in the
dataset. We prove several guarantees for noiselessly-private mechanisms. The
information content of the output about the data of an individual, even if an
adversary knows all the other entries of the private dataset, is bounded by the
privacy budget. The zero-error capacity of memory-less channels using
noiselessly private mechanisms for transmission is upper bounded by the privacy
budget. The performance of a non-stochastic hypothesis-testing adversary is
bounded again by the privacy budget. Finally, assuming that an adversary has
access to a stochastic prior on the dataset, we prove that the estimation error
of the adversary for individual entries of the dataset is lower bounded by a
decreasing function of the privacy budget. In this case, we also show that the
maximal information leakage is bounded by the privacy budget. In addition to
privacy guarantees, we prove that noiselessly-private mechanisms admit
composition theorem and post-processing does not weaken their privacy
guarantees. We prove that quantization operators can ensure noiseless privacy
if the number of quantization levels is appropriately selected based on the
sensitivity of the query and the privacy budget. Finally, we illustrate the
privacy merits of noiseless privacy using multiple datasets in energy and

the nature and strength of the non-bonding interactions at Metal-MoS2 (M-S) and

that the charge distribution at M-S interfaces depends sensitively on the

metal induced gap states play a main role at 3D metal-MoS2 interfaces; 2)
charge transfer occurs in Mo2C(OH)2 (or Mo2CO2)-MoS2 interfaces which means
electron distribution is determined by the band alignment of metal and MoS2; 3)
covalent-like feature appears at Mo2CF2-MoS2 interface. The S-S interface

work, we introduce a modification to traditional reinforcement learning which
we call observational dropout, whereby we limit the agents ability to observe

According to it, we recognize that the phase diagram of the model consists of
three regions: one normal phase and two superradiant phases. The quantum phase
transitions between the normal phase and the two superradiant phases are of
second order relating to the spontaneous breaking of the discrete $Z_{2}$

different superradiant phases is discontinuous with a phase boundary line

accelerates MR data acquisition at a sampling rate much lower than the Nyquist
criterion. A major challenge for CS-MRI lies in solving the severely ill-posed
inverse problem to reconstruct aliasing-free MR images from the sparse k-space
data. Conventional methods typically optimize an energy function, producing
reconstruction of high quality, but their iterative numerical solvers
unavoidably bring extremely slow processing. Recent data-driven techniques are
able to provide fast restoration by either learning direct prediction to final

Nevertheless, these data-driven predictors cannot guarantee the reconstruction
following constraints underlying the regularizers of conventional methods so
that the reliability of their reconstruction results are questionable. In this
paper, we propose a converged deep framework assembling principled modules for
CS-MRI that fuses learning strategy with the iterative solver of a conventional

also apply the framework to two practical tasks, \emph{i.e.}, parallel imaging

capability of a certain model from a source domain to a target domain. UDA is
of particular significance since no extra effort is devoted to annotating
target domain samples. However, the different data distributions in the two
domains, or \emph{domain shift/discrepancy}, inevitably compromise the UDA
performance. Although there has been a progress in matching the marginal
distributions between two domains, the classifier favors the source domain
features and makes incorrect predictions on the target domain due to
category-agnostic feature alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel category
anchor-guided (CAG) UDA model for semantic segmentation, which explicitly
enforces category-aware feature alignment to learn shared discriminative
features and classifiers simultaneously. First, the category-wise centroids of
the source domain features are used as guided anchors to identify the active
features in the target domain and also assign them pseudo-labels. Then, we
leverage an anchor-based pixel-level distance loss and a discriminative loss to
drive the intra-category features closer and the inter-category features
further apart, respectively. Finally, we devise a stagewise training mechanism
to reduce the error accumulation and adapt the proposed model progressively.

of the popular approaches to do point correlation is to partition the
point-cloud into voxels and extract features using standard 3D correlation. But
this approach suffers from sparsity of point-cloud and hence results in
multiple empty voxels. One possible solution to deal with this problem is to
learn a MLP to map a point or its local neighborhood to a high dimensional
feature space. All these methods suffer from a large number of parameters
requirement and are susceptible to random rotations. A popular way to make the

small rotations but the potential drawback includes \item more training samples

than two decades and, driven by the emerging applications, is still under
development. There is a lack of categorisation of existing solutions recently
and analysis for future research directions. In this paper, we review the
current status of the map-matching problem and survey the existing algorithms.
We propose a new categorisation of the solutions according to their
map-matching models and working scenarios. In addition, we experimentally
compare three representative methods from different categories to reveal how
matching model affects the performance. Besides, the experiments are conducted
on multiple real datasets with different settings to demonstrate the influence
of other factors in map-matching problem, like the trajectory quality, data

UEs' data challenge without further assumptions except strongly convex and

trade-off between local computation rounds of UE to update its local model and
global communication rounds to update the FL global model. We then employ the
proposed FL algorithm in wireless networks as a resource allocation
optimization problem that captures the trade-off between the FL convergence
wall clock time and energy consumption of UEs with heterogeneous computing and
power resources. Even though the wireless resource allocation problem of FL is
non-convex, we exploit this problem's structure to decompose it into three
sub-problems and analyze their closed-form solutions as well as insights to
problem design. Finally, we illustrate the theoretical analysis for the new

combining gradient boosting approximation and deep reinforcement learning to
solve the following two major problems. Firstly, in C-RANs, the decision making
process of resource allocation is time-consuming and computational-expensive,
motivating us to use an approximation method, i.e. the gradient boosting
decision tree (GBDT) to approximate the solutions of second order cone
programming (SOCP) problem. Moreover, considering the innumerable states in
real-time C-RAN systems, we employ a deep reinforcement learning framework,
i.e., deep Q-network (DQN) to generate a robust policy that controls the status
of remote radio heads (RRHs). We propose a GBDT-based DQN framework for the DRA
problem, where the heavy computation to solve SOCP problems is cut down and
great power consumption is saved in the whole C-RAN system. We demonstrate that
the generated policy is error-tolerant even the gradient boosting regression
may not be strictly subject to the constraints of the original problem.
Comparisons between the proposed method and existing baseline methods confirm
the advantages of our method.

for the vertical axis as well as an inertial measurement unit (IMU) device is

Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC). Many experiments to study
fundamental physics using this high-intensity muon beam are proposed. An
experiment to measure the muon magnetic moment anomaly ($g-2$) and the muon
electric dipole moment (EDM) is one of these experiments and it requires a
tracking detector for positrons from muon decay. Fine segmentation is required
in a detector to tolerate the high rate of positrons. The time resolution is
required to be much better than the muon anomalous spin precession period while
a buffer depth of a front-end electronics needs to be much longer than the
accelerated muon lifetime. Requirements of this detector also meet requirements
of a measurement of the muonium hyperfine structure interval at the J-PARC and
another experiment to measure the proton charge radius at Tohoku University. We
have developed a single-sided silicon strip sensor with a 190 $\mu$m pitch, a
front-end electronics with a sampling rate of 200 MHz and a buffer memory depth
of 8192, and a data acquisition system based on DAQ-Middleware for the J-PARC
muon $g-2$/EDM experiment. We have fabricated detector modules consisting of
this sensor and the front-end electronics. Performance of fabricated detector

  Classical and Quantum Computing Platforms",,,,,"cs.DM cs.AI cs.LO quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a Boolean formula $\phi(x)$ in conjunctive normal form (CNF), the
density of states counts the number of variable assignments that violate
exactly $e$ clauses, for all values of $e$. Thus, the density of states is a
histogram of the number of unsatisfied clauses over all possible assignments.
This computation generalizes both maximum-satisfiability (MAX-SAT) and model
counting problems and not only provides insight into the entire solution space,
but also yields a measure for the \emph{hardness} of the problem instance.
Consequently, in real-world scenarios, this problem is typically infeasible
even when using state-of-the-art algorithms. While finding an exact answer to
this problem is a computationally intensive task, we propose a novel approach
for estimating density of states based on the concentration of measure
inequalities. The methodology results in a quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO), which is particularly amenable to quantum annealing-based
solutions. We present the overall approach and compare results from the D-Wave
quantum annealer against the best-known classical algorithms such as the
Hamze-de Freitas-Selby (HFS) algorithm and satisfiability modulo theory (SMT)
solvers.

contemporary problems involve high dimensional datum $\x \in \R^\d$ whose
entries often lie in a union of subspaces and the goal is to find out which
entries of $\x$ match with a particular subspace $\sU$, classically called
\emph {matched subspace detection}. Consequently, entries that match with one
subspace are considered as inliers w.r.t the subspace while all other entries
are considered as outliers. Proportion of outliers relative to each subspace
varies based on the degree of coordinates from subspaces. This problem is a
combinatorial NP-hard in nature and has been immensely studied in recent years.
Existing approaches can solve the problem when outliers are sparse. However, if
outliers are abundant or in other words if $\x$ contains coordinates from a
fair amount of subspaces, this problem can't be solved with acceptable accuracy
or within a reasonable amount of time. This paper proposes a two-stage approach

effectiveness of our method.

this paper, we propose the first MST framework to automatically incorporate

the existing SST backbone network by introducing a novel multi-level feature
fusion module and a patch attention module to achieve better semantic

the facts of obvious seasonality demand in the film industry and severe

film studios choose release time for movies they produce to maximize their box
offices. We first formalize this problem as an attraction competition game
where players (film studios) consider both potential profits and competitors'
choices when deciding the release time. Then we prove that there always exists
a pure Nash equilibrium and give the sufficient condition of the uniqueness of
the Nash equilibrium. Our model can be generalized to an extensive game and we
compute the subgame-perfect equilibrium for homogeneous players. For the case
that one film studio could have multiple movies to release, we prove that
finding a player's best response is NP-hard and it does not guarantee the
existence of a pure Nash equilibrium. Experiments are provided to support the
soundness of our model. In the final state, most of film studios, accounting
for 84 percent of the market, would not change their release time. The

molecular transformations remains a considerable experimental challenge. Here
we have investigated photoinduced electron transfer dynamics following a
metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) excitation of the [Fe(bmip)2]2+
photosensitizer, where bmip = 2,6-bis(3-methyl-imidazole-1- ylidine)-pyridine,
with simultaneous femtosecond-resolution Fe K{\alpha} and K\b{eta} X-ray
Emission Spectroscopy (XES) and Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS). This
measurement clearly shows temporal oscillations in the XES and WAXS difference
signals with the same 278 fs period oscillation. The oscillatory signal
originates from an Fe-ligand stretching mode vibrational wavepacket on a
triplet metal-centered (3MC) excited state surface. The vibrational wavepacket
is created by 40% of the excited population that undergoes electron transfer
from the non-equilibrium MLCT excited state to the 3MC excited state with a 110
fs time constant, while the other 60% relaxes to a 3MLCT excited state in
parallel. The sensitivity of the K{\alpha} XES spectrum to molecular structure
results from core-level vibronic coupling, due to a 0.7% average Fe-ligand bond
length difference in the lowest energy geometry of the 1s and 2p core-ionized
states. These results highlight the importance of vibronic effects in
time-resolved XES experiments and demonstrate the role of metal-centered
excited states in the electronic excited state relaxation dynamics of an Fe
carbene photosensitizer.

Apart from this, we discuss two possible schemes to coherently prepare dark

the Zeeman degeneracy. Although the analysis focuses on the single-site

any geometry out of product states of single-site dark states. Finally, we

interdiffusion at the underlayer/Heusler interface and the formation of an

of the ultrathin films, the interfacial CoFe-rich layer promotes the strong PMA
through the electronic hybridization of the metal alloy and oxygen orbitals

layer it is also generating an increase of the Gilbert damping for the
ultrathin films beyond the spin-pumping effect. Our results illustrate that the

sharing their data with each other. Each client performs training locally and
then submits the model updates to a central server for aggregation. Since the
server has no visibility into the process of generating the updates,
collaborative learning is vulnerable to poisoning attacks where a malicious
client can generate a poisoned update to introduce backdoor functionality to
the joint model. The existing solutions for detecting poisoned updates,
however, fail to defend against the recently proposed attacks, especially in
the non-IID setting. In this paper, we present a novel defense scheme to detect
anomalous updates in both IID and non-IID settings. Our key idea is to realize
client-side cross-validation, where each update is evaluated over other
clients' local data. The server will adjust the weights of the updates based on
the evaluation results when performing aggregation. To adapt to the unbalanced
distribution of data in the non-IID setting, a dynamic client allocation
mechanism is designed to assign detection tasks to the most suitable clients.
During the detection process, we also protect the client-level privacy to
prevent malicious clients from stealing the training data of other clients, by
integrating differential privacy with our design without degrading the
detection performance. Our experimental evaluations on two real-world datasets
show that our scheme is significantly robust to two representative poisoning
attacks.

controversial issue of the criticality of the noncollinear magnets with the

larger than the sizes studied by the previous numerical works on the model.
Availability of such large-size data enables us to examine the detailed
critical properties including the effect of corrections to the leading scaling.
Strong numerical evidence of the continuous nature of the transition is
obtained. Our data indicates the existence of significant corrections to the
leading scaling. Careful analysis by taking account of the possible corrections
yield critical exponents estimates, $\alpha=0.44(3)$, $\beta=0.26(2)$,
$\gamma=1.03(5)$, $\nu=0.52(1)$, $\eta=0.02(5)$, and the chirality exponents
$\beta_\kappa=0.40(3)$ and $\gamma_\kappa=0.77(6)$, supporting the existence of
the $O(3)$ chiral (or $O(3)\times O(2)$) universality class governed by a new
`chiral' fixed point. We also obtain an indication that the underlying fixed
point is of the focus-type, characterized by the complex-valued

0.7^{+0.1}_{-0.4}$. The focus-like nature of the chiral fixed point accompanied
by the spiral-like renormalization-group (RG) flow is likely to be the origin
of the apparently complicated critical behavior. The results are compared and

several distinct types of RG calculations including the higher-order

  subspace",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper discusses a new type of discriminant analysis based on the
orthogonal projection of data onto a generalized difference subspace (GDS). In
our previous work, we have demonstrated that GDS projection works as the
quasi-orthogonalization of class subspaces, which is an effective feature
extraction for subspace based classifiers. Interestingly, GDS projection also
works as a discriminant feature extraction through a similar mechanism to the
Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA). A direct proof of the connection between
GDS projection and FDA is difficult due to the significant difference in their
formulations. To avoid the difficulty, we first introduce geometrical Fisher
discriminant analysis (gFDA) based on a simplified Fisher criterion. Our
simplified Fisher criterion is derived from a heuristic yet practically
plausible principle: the direction of the sample mean vector of a class is in
most cases almost equal to that of the first principal component vector of the
class, under the condition that the principal component vectors are calculated
by applying the principal component analysis (PCA) without data centering. gFDA
can work stably even under few samples, bypassing the small sample size (SSS)
problem of FDA. Next, we prove that gFDA is equivalent to GDS projection with a
small correction term. This equivalence ensures GDS projection to inherit the
discriminant ability from FDA via gFDA. Furthermore, to enhance the
performances of gFDA and GDS projection, we normalize the projected vectors on
the discriminant spaces. Extensive experiments using the extended Yale B+
database and the CMU face database show that gFDA and GDS projection have
equivalent or better performance than the original FDA and its extensions.

to realize more energy-efficient information processing. In the 2D transition
metal dichalcogenide, the spin/valley current can be generated by utilizing the
circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE), i.e., the generation of photocurrent by a
circularly polarized light. Here we show that an in-plane electric field at
MoS2/WSe2 heterostructure-electrode boundary results in an electrically tunable
circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) under optical excitation with normal
incidence. The observed CPGE can be explained by the valence band shift due to
the in-plane electric field and different effective relaxation times between
hole and electron combined with the valley optical selection rule. Furthermore,
we show that the CPGE can be controlled by changing the Fermi level using an
out-of-plane electric field. Such phenomena persist even at room temperature.
This finding may facilitate the utilization of 2D heterostructure as an
opto-valleytronics and opto-spintronics device platform.

may affect a response heterogeneously across different quantile levels.
Unfortunately, existing approaches find it extremely difficult to adjust for
any dependency between observation units, largely because such methods are not
based upon a fully generative model of the data. For analyzing spatially
indexed data, we address this difficulty by generalizing the joint quantile
regression model of Yang and Tokdar (2017) and characterizing spatial
dependence via a Gaussian or $t$ copula process on the underlying quantile
levels of the observation units. A Bayesian semiparametric approach is
introduced to perform inference of model parameters and carry out spatial
quantile smoothing. An effective model comparison criteria is provided,
particularly for selecting between different model specifications of tail
heaviness and tail dependence. Extensive simulation studies and an application

algorithmic decision-making in AVs can also introduce new issues that create

  Models","18th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and
  Applications (ICMLA)",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Evaluating, explaining, and visualizing high-level concepts in generative
models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs), is challenging in part due to
a lack of known prediction classes that are required to generate saliency maps
in supervised learning. While saliency maps may help identify relevant features
(e.g., pixels) in the input for classification tasks of deep neural networks,
similar frameworks are understudied in unsupervised learning. Therefore, we
introduce a new method of obtaining saliency maps for latent representations of
known or novel high-level concepts, often called concept vectors in generative
models. Concept scores, analogous to class scores in classification tasks, are
defined as dot products between concept vectors and encoded input data, which
can be readily used to compute the gradients. The resulting concept saliency
maps are shown to highlight input features deemed important for high-level
concepts. Our method is applied to the VAE's latent space of CelebA dataset in
which known attributes such as ""smiles"" and ""hats"" are used to elucidate
relevant facial features. Furthermore, our application to spatial
transcriptomic (ST) data of a mouse olfactory bulb demonstrates the potential
of latent representations of morphological layers and molecular features in
advancing our understanding of complex biological systems. By extending the
popular method of saliency maps to generative models, the proposed concept
saliency maps help improve interpretability of latent variable models in deep
learning.

network decomposable in any size), which allows flexible changes to model size
without retraining. We decompose weight matrices in the DNNs via singular value
decomposition and adjust ranks according to the target model size. Unlike the
existing low-rank compression methods that specialize the model to a fixed

for both of full- and low-rank networks. This enables not only to maintain the
performance of a full-rank network {\it without retraining} but also to improve
low-rank networks in multiple sizes. Additionally, we introduce a simple
criterion for rank selection that effectively suppresses approximation error.
In experiments on the ImageNet classification task, Decomposable-Net yields
superior accuracy in a wide range of model sizes. In particular,
Decomposable-Net achieves the top-1 accuracy of $73.2\%$ with $0.27\times$MACs

planetesimals. Many debris discs have been found and resolved around hot and
solar-type stars. However, only a handful have been discovered around M-stars,
and the reasons for their paucity remain unclear. Here we check whether the
sensitivity and wavelength coverage of present-day telescopes are simply
unfavourable for detection of these discs or if they are truly rare. We
approach this question by looking at the Herschel/DEBRIS survey that has
searched for debris discs including M-type stars. Assuming that these cool-star
discs are ""similar"" to those of the hotter stars in some sense (i.e., in terms
of dust location, temperature, fractional luminosity, or mass), we check
whether this survey should have found them. With our procedure we can reproduce
the $2.1^{+4.5}_{-1.7}$% detection rate of M-star debris discs of the DEBRIS
survey, which implies that these discs can indeed be similar to discs around
hotter stars and just avoid detection. We then apply this procedure to IRAM
NIKA-2 and ALMA bands 3, 6 and 7 to predict possible detection rates and give
recommendations for future observations. We do not favour observing with IRAM,
since it leads to detection rates lower than for the DEBRIS survey, with
0.6%-4.5% for a 15 min observation. ALMA observations, with detection rates
0.9%-7.2%, do not offer a significant improvement either, and so we conclude
that more sensitive far-infrared and single dish sub-millimetre telescopes are
necessary to discover the missing population of M-star debris discs.

spectroscopic survey (MRS) using the gradient spectra and the
coefficients-of-dependence (CODs). In general, the wavelength coverage of the
MRS well constrains the stellar labels but the sensitivities of different
stellar labels vary with spectral types and metallicity of the stars of
interest and, therefore, affect the performance of the stellar label
determination from the MRS spectra. Applying the SLAM to the synthetic spectra
which mimic the MRS data, we find the precision of the fundamental stellar
parameters Teff, logg and [M/H] are better when combining both the blue and red
bands of the MRS. This is especially important for warm stars since the
H$\alpha$ line located in the red part plays a more important role in
determining the effective temperature for warm stars. With blue and red parts
together, we are able to reach similar performance to the low-resolution
spectra except for warm stars. However, at [M/H]$\sim-2.0$ dex, the
uncertainties of fundamental stellar labels estimated from MRS are
substantially larger than those from low-resolution spectra. We also tested the
uncertainties of Teff, logg and [M/H] of from MRS data induced from the radial
velocity mismatch and find that a mismatch of about 1 km s$^{-1}$, which is
typical for LAMOST MRS data, would not significantly affect the stellar label
estimates. At last, reference precision limits are calculated using synthetic
gradient spectra, according to which we expect abundances of at least 17
elements to be measured precisely from MRS spectra.

various positions across the tree of life. It describes the ability of a
microorganism to switch to a metabolically inactive state that can withstand
unfavorable conditions. However, maintaining such a trait requires additional
resources that could otherwise be used to increase e.g. reproductive rates. In
this paper, we aim for gaining a basic understanding under which conditions
maintaining a seed bank of dormant individuals provides a ""fitness advantage""
when facing resource limitations and competition for resources among
individuals (in an otherwise stable environment). In particular, we wish to
understand when an individual with a ""dormancy trait"" can invade a resident
population lacking this trait despite having a lower reproduction rate than the
residents.
  To this end, we follow a stochastic individual-based approach employing
birth-and-death processes, where dormancy is triggered by competitive pressure
for resources. In the large-population limit, we identify a necessary and
sufficient condition under which a complete invasion of mutants has a positive
probability. Further, we explicitly determine the limiting probability of
invasion and the asymptotic time to fixation of mutants in the case of a
successful invasion. In the proofs, we observe the three classical phases of

energy storage, but Li metal anode is highly reactive with electrolyte and
forms uncontrolled dendrite that can cause undesirable parasitic reactions thus
poor cycling stability and raise safety concerns. Despite remarkable progress
made to partly solve these issues, the Li metal still plate at the
electrode/electrolyte interface where the parasitic reactions and dendrite
formation invariably occur. Here we demonstrate the inward-growth plating of Li
into a metal foil while avoiding surface deposition, which is driven by the
reversible solid-solution based alloy phase change. Lithiation of the solid
solution alloy phase facilitates the freshly generated Li atoms at the surface
to sink into the foil, while the reversible alloy phase change is companied by
the dealloying reaction during delithiation, which extracts Li atoms from
inside of the foil. The yielded dendrite free Li anode produces an enhanced
Coulombic efficiency of 99.5 plus or minus 0.2% with a reversible capacity of
1660 mA h $g^{-1}$ (3.3 mA h cm$^{-2}$).

liquid phase was first realized by the Waseda group 40 years ago, but at that
time the technical challenges were overwhelming. Although the tests were
successful, this method was finally discarded and eventually nearly forgotten.
For present day large LXe Dark Matter detectors, this approach was not even
considered. Instead the Dual Phase technology was selected despite many
limitations and challenges. In two independent studies the groups from Columbia
University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University reevaluated Proportional
Scintillation in the liquid phase. Both established the merits for very large
LXe detectors, but the Columbia group also encountered apparent limitations,
namely the shadowing of the light by the anode wires and a dependence of the
pulse shape on the drift path of the electrons in the anode region. The
discrepancies between the two studies, however, are not intrinsic to the
technique, but a direct consequence of the chosen geometry. Taking the
geometrical differences into account the results match without ambiguity. They
also agree with the original results from the Waseda group. With the technical
problems solved, the path is now open to use this method in future large LXe
TPCs.

boundary conditions and the spin chain with triangular boundary conditions as
well as the class of spin chains that can be brought to such form by certain
similarity transformations in the physical space. The boundary driven Symmetric
Simple Exclusion Process (open SSEP) belongs to the latter. We derive a
transformation that maps the eigenvectors of the diagonal spin chain to the
eigenvectors of the triangular chain. This transformation yields an essential
simplification for determining the states beyond half-filling. It allows to
first determine the eigenstates of the diagonal chain through the Bethe ansatz
on the fully excited reference state and subsequently map them to the
triangular chain for which only the vacuum serves as a reference state. In
particular the transformed reference state, i.e. the fully excited eigenstate
of the triangular chain, is presented at any length of the chain. It can be
mapped to the steady state of the open SSEP. This results in a concise
closed-form expression for the probabilities of particle distributions and
correlation functions in the steady state. Further, the complete set of

electron affinity, heterojunctions with most n-type oxide semiconductors
exhibit conduction and valence band offsets at the heterointerface in excess of
1 eV. ZnO/NiO junctions exhibit a so called type-II band alignment, making
electron-hole recombination the only process by which a current can vertically
flow through the structure. These heterojunctions are nevertheless shown to be
of practical use in efficient optoelectronic devices, as exemplified here by
our UV-converting transparent solar cells. These devices, although exhibiting
high conversion efficiencies, suffer from two light-activated recombination
channels connected to the type-II interface, one of which we identify and
analyse in more detail here. Furthermore, CdO/NiO contacts were studied - a
heterostructure with even larger band offsets such that a type-III band
alignment is achieved. This situation theoretically enables the development of
a 2-dimensional electronic system consisting of topologically protected states.
We present experiments demonstrating that the CdO/NiO heterostructure indeed
hosts a conductive layer absent in both materials when studied separately.

trace the molecular abundances of the gas that is being collected into
planetary atmospheres. We include atmospheric pollution of incoming (icy)
planetesimals as well as the effect of refractory carbon erosion noted to exist
in our own solar system. We find that the carbon and oxygen content of
Neptune-mass planets are determined primarily through solid accretion and
result in more oxygen-rich (by roughly two orders of magnitude) atmospheres
than Hot-Jupiters, whose C/O are primarily determined by gas accretion.
Generally we find a `main-sequence' between the fraction of planetary mass
accreted through solid accretion and the resulting atmospheric C/O - with
planets of higher solid accretion fraction having lower C/O. Hot-Jupiters whose
atmospheres have been chemically characterized agree well with our population
of planets, and our results suggest that Hot Jupiter formation typically begins
near the water ice line. Lower mass hot-Neptunes are observed to be much more
carbon-rich (with 0.33 $\lesssim$ C/O $\lesssim$ 1) than is found in our models
(C/O $\sim 10^{-2}$), and suggest that some form of chemical processing may
affect their observed C/O over the few Gyrs between formation and observation.

model describing the modulation instability (MI) of quasi monochromatic waves
in weakly nonlinear media, and MI is considered the main physical mechanism for
the appearence of anomalous (rogue) waves (AWs) in nature. Using the finite gap
method, two of us (PGG and PMS) have recently solved, to leading order and in
terms of elementary functions of the initial data, the NLS Cauchy problem for
generic periodic initial perturbations of the unstable background solution of
NLS (what we call the Cauchy problem of the AWs), in the case of a finite
number of unstable modes. In this paper, concentrating on the simplest case of
a single unstable mode, we study the periodic Cauchy problem of the AWs for the
NLS equation perturbed by a linear loss or gain term. Using the finite gap
method and the theory of perturbations of soliton PDEs, we construct the proper
analytic model describing quantitatively how the solution evolves, after a
suitable transient, into slowly varying lower dimensional patterns (attractors)
in the $(x,t)$ plane, characterized by $\Delta X=L/2$ in the case of loss, and
by $\Delta X=0$ in the case of gain, where $\Delta X$ is the $x$-shift of the
position of the AW during the recurrence, and $L$ is the period. This process
is described, to leading order, in terms of elementary functions of the initial
data. Since dissipation can hardly be avoided in all natural phenomena
involving AWs, and since a small dissipation induces $O(1)$ effects on the
periodic AW dynamics, generating the slowly varying loss/gain attractors
analytically described in this paper, we expect that these attractors, together
with their generalizations corresponding to more unstable modes, will play a
basic role in the theory of periodic AWs in nature.

The aim of our study is twofold. On one hand, this minimization problem is
related to the existence and orbital stability of standing waves for the mixed
dispersion nonlinear biharmonic Schr\""odinger equation \begin{equation*} i
\partial_t \psi -\gamma \Delta^2 \psi - \beta \Delta \psi + \alpha
|\psi|^{2\sigma} \psi =0, \quad \psi (0, x)=\psi_0 (x),\quad (t, x) \in
\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^N. \end{equation*} On the other hand, in most of
the applications of the Concentration-Compactness principle of P.-L. Lions, the
difficult part is to deal with the possible dichotomy of the minimizing
sequences. The problem under consideration provides an example for which, to
rule out the dichotomy is rather standard while, to rule out the vanishing,
here for $c > 0$ small, is challenging. We also provide, in the limit $c \to
0$, a precise description of the behaviour of the minima. Finally, some
extensions and open problems are proposed.

Almost all approaches try to find scaling features of a given time series.
However, the analysis of such scaling properties has some difficulties such as
finding a proper scaling region. On the other hand, such correlation detection
methods may be affected by the probability distribution function of the series.
In this article, we apply the horizontal visibility graph algorithm to map
stochastic time series into networks. By investigating the magnitude and sign
of a multifractal time series, we show that one can detect linear as well as
nonlinear correlations, even for situations that have been considered as
uncorrelated noises by typical approaches like MFDFA. In this respect, we
introduce a topological parameter that can well measure the strength of
nonlinear correlations. This parameter is independent of the probability
distribution function and calculated without the need to find any scaling

allow label proportions to be collected because of data privacy or annotation
cost, and has recently received lots of research attention. Most existing works
focus on extending supervised learning models to solve the LLP problem, but the
weak learning nature makes it hard to further improve LLP performance with a

regularization, a popular concept in semi-supervised learning that encourages
the model to produce a decision boundary that better describes the data
manifold. With the introduction of consistency regularization, we further
extend our study to non-uniform bag-generation and validation-based

Parameter optimization allows to almost perfectly reproduce the

fundamental task in a wide range of applications in education, such as massive
open online courses (MOOCs), intelligent tutoring systems, educational games,
and learning management systems. It models dynamics in a student's knowledge
states in relation to different learning concepts through their interactions
with learning activities. Recently, several attempts have been made to use deep
learning models for tackling the KT problem. Although these deep learning
models have shown promising results, they have limitations: either lack the
ability to go deeper to trace how specific concepts in a knowledge state are
mastered by a student, or fail to capture long-term dependencies in an exercise
sequence. In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing a novel deep
learning model for knowledge tracing, namely Sequential Key-Value Memory
Networks (SKVMN). This model unifies the strengths of recurrent modelling
capacity and memory capacity of the existing deep learning KT models for
modelling student learning. We have extensively evaluated our proposed model on
five benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that (1) SKVMN
outperforms the state-of-the-art KT models on all datasets, (2) SKVMN can
better discover the correlation between latent concepts and questions, and (3)
SKVMN can trace the knowledge state of students dynamics, and a leverage
sequential dependencies in an exercise sequence for improved predication
accuracy.

massive shell containing a few pointlike light sources inside would be
perceived not like a three-dimensional ball for a localized observer outside
the shell in terms of the affine or binocular distance. As the radius of the
spherical shell approaches the Schwarzschild radius, the perceived distance
between the front and rear surfaces of the shell would go to zero, while the
images of most of the interior emitters would squeeze around the shell surfaces
in terms of the affine or binocular distance. So, the Schwarzschild black hole
formed from the star would be thought of as a two-dimensional membrane for the
observers who can only measure the binocular distance and/or affine distance.
However, the depth information of a point source inside the nearly black star
can still be resolved in terms of the radar or luminosity distance, which needs
the knowledge about the radar signals or standard candles sent in earlier by
the observer outside the star. This suggests that at late times of
gravitational collapse the area law of the entropy would dominate over the
volume law for outside observers due to the loss of the knowledge about the
ingoing probes earlier.

affects both the direction and amplitude of the light wave. This paper analyzes
the propagation path loss and geometrical gain, channel impulse and frequency
response for light propagation along the neural tissue. The total attenuation
depends on the propagation medium loss and geometrical gain, and the channel
response is highly dependent on the quantity of cells along the path.
Additionally, the optical properties of the medium also impacts on the time

out of the difference between bid and ask prices while mitigating the market

a setting in which the weights are updated after each sample is received and
the sample is then discarded. Under this setting, an update can lead to overly
global generalization by changing too many weights. The global generalization
interferes with what was previously learned and deteriorates performance, a
phenomenon known as catastrophic interference. Many previous works use
mechanisms such as experience replay (ER) buffers to mitigate interference by
performing minibatch updates, ensuring the data distribution is approximately
independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.). But using ER would become
infeasible in terms of memory as problem complexity increases. Thus, it is
crucial to look for more memory-efficient alternatives. Interference can be
averted if we replace global updates with more local ones, so only weights
responsible for the observed data sample are updated. In this work, we propose
the use of dynamic self-organizing map (DSOM) with neural networks to induce
such locality in the updates without ER buffers. Our method learns a DSOM to
produce a mask to reweigh each hidden unit's output, modulating its degree of
use. It prevents interference by replacing global updates with local ones,
conditioned on the agent's state. We validate our method on standard RL
benchmarks including Mountain Car and Lunar Lander, where existing methods
often fail to learn without ER. Empirically, we show that our online and fully

this is a simple and tractable setting in which to study dense networks, it
doesn't properly characterise the stochastic geometry of user-base station
interactions in some dense deployment scenarios, which may involve short and
long range links, with some paired very nearby optimally, and others
sub-optimally due to local crowding. Since the users will pair one-to-one with
base stations, we can consider using the popular bipartite Euclidean matching
(BEM) from spatial combinatorics, and study the corresponding (meta)
distribution of the signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR). This provides detailed
information about the proportion of links in the network meeting a target
reliability constraint. We can then observe via comparison the impact of taking
into account the variable/correlated short-range distances between the
transmitter-receiver pairs on the communication statistics. We illustrate and
quantify how the widely-accepted bipolar model fails to capture the
network-wide reliability of communication in a typical ultra-dense setting
based on a binomial point process. We also show how assuming a Gamma
distribution for link distances may be a simple improvement on the bipolar

accuracy and security requirements for remote sensing images (RSIs) recognition

deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) outperform traditional hand-craft
feature techniques. However, CNNs also pose security issues when they show
their capability of accurate classification. By adding a very small variation
of the adversarial perturbation to the input image, the CNN model can be caused
to produce erroneous results with extremely high confidence, and the
modification of the image is not perceived by the human eye. This added
adversarial perturbation image is called an adversarial example, which poses a
serious security problem for systems based on CNN model recognition results.
This paper, for the first time, analyzes adversarial example problem of RSI
recognition under CNN models. In the experiments, we used different attack
algorithms to fool multiple high-accuracy RSI recognition models trained on
multiple RSI datasets. The results show that RSI recognition models are also
vulnerable to adversarial examples, and the models with different structures
trained on the same RSI dataset also have different vulnerabilities. For each
RSI dataset, the number of features also affects the vulnerability of the
model. Many features are good for defensive adversarial examples. Further, we
find that the attacked class of RSI has an attack selectivity property. The
misclassification of adversarial examples of the RSIs are related to the
similarity of the original classes in the CNN feature space. In addition,
adversarial examples in RSI recognition are of great significance for the
security of remote sensing applications, showing a huge potential for future

calculations show that due to the hBN buffer layer, the band structure of the
TMDC is preserved, with an additional proximity-induced exchange splitting in
the bands. We extract proximity exchange parameters in the 1--10 meV range,
depending on the FM. The combination of proximity-induced exchange and
intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the TMDCs, leads to a valley
polarization, translating into magnetic exchange fields of tens of Tesla. The
extracted parameters are useful for subsequent exciton calculations of TMDCs in
the presence of a hBN/FM spin injector. Our calculated absorption spectra show
large splittings for the exciton peaks; in the case of MoS$_2$/hBN/Co we find a
value of about 8 meV, corresponding to about 50 Tesla external magnetic field

an unknown state of a system almost without disturbing or collapsing it. The
underlying idea is to extract information of a system from the thermodynamic
quantities like work(s) and heat in a process, thereby uncovering a fundamental
correspondence between information and thermodynamics. We establish an improved
notion of information isolation and show that a process is isolated if it
respects the first law of quantum thermodynamics for a given set of conserved
quantities or charges. The measurement process involves a global unitary
evolution of the system, an apparatus, and a battery which supplies work(s).
The global unitary respects the first law. The full information about the
system is accessed by counting the charge-wise work costs to implement the
reduced evolution on the system and the apparatus. After the work costs are
determined, the process is undone where a state of the system is retrieved
arbitrarily close to the original initial state. The measurement process is
also capable of characterizing an unknown quantum operation. Fundamentally, our
findings make an important step towards resolving the paradoxes arising from
the quantum measurement problem, such as the Wigner's friend paradox, and the
issue related to the objective reality of quantum states. We discuss the
technological implications of the almost collapse-free measurement process.

condition for hydrostatic equilibrium. In the present work we aim at showing
that a generalised TOV equation also characterises the equilibrium of models
endowed with other symmetries besides spherical. We apply the dual null
formalism to spacetimes with two dimensional spherical, planar and hyperbolic
symmetries with a perfect fluid as the source. We also assume a Killing vector
field orthogonal to the surfaces of symmetry, which gives us static solutions,
in the timelike Killing field case, and homogeneous dynamical solutions in the
case the Killing field is spacelike. In order to treat equally all the
aforementioned cases, we discuss the definition of a quasi-local energy for the
spacetimes with planar and hyperbolic foliations, since the Hawking-Hayward
definition only applies to compact foliations. After this procedure, we are
able to translate our geometrical formalism to the fluid dynamics language in a
unified way, to find the generalized TOV equation, for the three cases when the
solution is static, and to obtain the evolution equation, for the homogeneous
spacetime cases. Remarkably, we show that the static solutions which are not
spherically symmetric violate the weak energy condition (WEC). We have also
shown that the counterpart of the TOV equation for the spatially homogeneous
models is just the familiar equation \r{ho} + P = 0, defining a cosmological
constant-type behaviour, both in the hyperbolic and spherical cases. This
implies a violation of the strong energy condition in both cases, added to the
above mentioned violation of the weak energy condition in the hyperbolic case.
We illustrate our unified treatment obtaining analogs of Schwarzschild interior

Vertex operator algebras are especially well suited for studying logarithmic

singularities arising from non-semisimple modules for the chiral algebra)
because of the logarithmic tensor category theory of Huang, Lepowsky, and

subalgebra $V^G$ of a vertex operator (super)algebra $V$ with finite

$g$-twisted $V$-modules for possibly several $g\in G$, that the category of all
such twisted $V$-modules is a braided $G$-crossed (super)category, and that the
$G$-equivariantization of this braided $G$-crossed (super)category is braided
tensor equivalent to the original category $\mathcal{C}$ of $V^G$-modules. This
generalizes results of Kirillov and M\""{u}ger proved using rigidity and
semisimplicity. We also apply the main results to the orbifold rationality

start with a passive glassy state of the system and apply activity to the
smaller particles, which shows a nonmonotonous glassy character of the active
particles with the persistence time of the active force, from its passive limit
(zero activity). On the other hand, passive particles of the active-passive
mixture phase separate at the intermediate persistence time of the active
force, resulting in the hexatic-liquid and solid-liquid phases. Thus, our
system shows three regimes as active glass, phase separation, and active
liquid, as the persistence time increases from its smaller values. We show that
the solidlike and hexatic phases consisting of passive large particles are
stable due to the smaller momentum transfer from active to passive particles,

ordering vanishes. Our model is relevant to active biological systems, where

generating a blue-tilted curvature power spectrum without superhorizon growth.
As a concrete realization, we consider a potential with two slow-roll stages,
separated by the constant-roll stage, in a way that satisfies the current
constraints on the power spectrum and the primordial black hole abundance. The
model can produce primordial black holes as all dark matter, LIGO-Virgo events,

by the constant-roll potential, this construction is particularly robust and
testable by future observations.

  technical debt","38pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the process of software evolution, developers often sacrifice the
long-term code quality to satisfy the short-term goals due to specific reasons,
which is called technical debt. In particular, self-admitted technical debt
(SATD) refers to those that were intentionally introduced and remarked by code
comments. Those technical debts reduce the quality of software and increase the
cost of subsequent software maintenance. Therefore, it is necessary to find out
and resolve these debts in time. Recently, many approaches have been proposed
to identify SATD. However, those approaches either have a low accuracy or are
complex to implementation in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple
unsupervised baseline approach that fuzzily matches task annotation tags (MAT)
to identify SATD. MAT does not need any training data to build a prediction
model. Instead, MAT only examines whether any of four task tags (i.e. TODO,
FIXME, XXX, and HACK) appears in the comments of a target project to identify
SATD. In this sense, MAT is a natural baseline approach, which has a good
understandability, in SATD identification. In order to evaluate the usefulness
of MAT, we use 10 open-source projects to conduct the experiment. The
experimental results reveal that MAT has a surprisingly excellent performance
for SATD identification compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. As such,
we suggest that, in the future SATD identification studies, MAT should be
considered as an easy-to-implement baseline to which any new approach should be
compared against to demonstrate its usefulness.

according to a target non-uniform distribution resulting in a shaping gain.
This is realized by replacing the polar encoder in the sign-bit level by a
successive cancellation (SC) decoder, such that the overall complexity is not

first use the Bussgang decomposition to linearize the one-bit quantized

Gaussian, we assume the effective noise as a Gaussian noise with the same
statistics to apply the Kalman filtering. We also implement the truncated

performance loss. Numerical results reveal that the proposed channel estimators
can improve the estimation accuracy significantly by using the spatial and

significant implications in particular for the case of large recurrent flares,
which pose challenging questions about the conditions that lead to the episodic
energy release processes. It is not yet clear whether these events occur due to
the continuous supply of free magnetic energy to the solar corona or because
not all of the available free magnetic energy is released during a single major
flaring event. In order to address this question, we report on the evolution of
photospheric magnetic field and the associated net Lorentz force changes in ARs
11261 and 11283, each of which gave rise to recurrent eruptive M- and X-class
flares. Our study reveals that after the abrupt downward changes during each
flare, the net Lorentz force increases by (2-5)x10^22 dyne in between the
successive flares. This distinct rebuild-up of net Lorentz forces is the first
observational evidence found in the evolution of any non-potential parameter of
solar active regions (ARs), which suggests that new energy was supplied to the
ARs in order to produce the recurrent large flares. The rebuild-up of magnetic
free energy of the ARs is further confirmed by the observations of continuous
shearing motion of moving magnetic features of opposite polarities near the
polarity inversion line. The evolutionary pattern of the net Lorentz force
changes reported in this study has significant implications, in particular, for
the forecasting of recurrent large eruptive flares from the same AR and hence
the chances of interaction between the associated CMEs.

explored. A typical one-dimensional domain wall in a bulk ferromagnet with
biaxial magnetic anisotropy is considered. In the framework of Walker-type of
solutions of steady-state ferromagnetic domain wall motion, the reduction of
the non-linear Landau-Lifshitz equation to a Lorentz-invariant sine-Gordon
equation typical for antiferromagnets is formally possible for velocities lower
than a critical velocity of the topological soliton. The velocity dependence of
the domain wall energy and the domain wall width are expressed in the
relativistic-like form in the limit of large ratio of the easy-plane/easy-axis

machine translation. The dominant approach to subword segmentation is Byte Pair
Encoding (BPE), which keeps the most frequent words intact while splitting the
rare ones into multiple tokens. While multiple segmentations are possible even
with the same vocabulary, BPE splits words into unique sequences; this may
prevent a model from better learning the compositionality of words and being
robust to segmentation errors. So far, the only way to overcome this BPE
imperfection, its deterministic nature, was to create another subword
segmentation algorithm (Kudo, 2018). In contrast, we show that BPE itself
incorporates the ability to produce multiple segmentations of the same word. We
introduce BPE-dropout - simple and effective subword regularization method
based on and compatible with conventional BPE. It stochastically corrupts the
segmentation procedure of BPE, which leads to producing multiple segmentations
within the same fixed BPE framework. Using BPE-dropout during training and the
standard BPE during inference improves translation quality up to 3 BLEU
compared to BPE and up to 0.9 BLEU compared to the previous subword
regularization.

evaluate the consistency in performance of machine learning models across

estimate skin tone in benchmark skin disease datasets, and investigate whether
model performance is dependent on this measure. Specifically, we use individual
typology angle (ITA) to approximate skin tone in dermatology datasets. We look
at the distribution of ITA values to better understand skin color
representation in two benchmark datasets: 1) the ISIC 2018 Challenge dataset, a
collection of dermoscopic images of skin lesions for the detection of skin
cancer, and 2) the SD-198 dataset, a collection of clinical images capturing a
wide variety of skin diseases. To estimate ITA, we first develop segmentation
models to isolate non-diseased areas of skin. We find that the majority of the
data in the the two datasets have ITA values between 34.5{\deg} and 48{\deg},
which are associated with lighter skin, and is consistent with
under-representation of darker skinned populations in these datasets. We also
find no measurable correlation between performance of machine learning model

validation.

In reality, most data is scattered across different organizations and cannot be
easily integrated under many legal and practical constraints. Federated
Transfer Learning (FTL) was introduced in [1] to improve statistical models
under a data federation that allow knowledge to be shared without compromising
user privacy, and enable complementary knowledge to be transferred in the
network. As a result, a target-domain party can build more flexible and
powerful models by leveraging rich labels from a source-domain party. However,
the excessive computational overhead of the security protocol involved in this
model rendered it impractical. In this work, we aim towards enhancing the
efficiency and security of existing models for practical collaborative training
under a data federation by incorporating Secret Sharing (SS). In literature,
only the semi-honest model for Federated Transfer Learning has been considered.
In this paper, we improve upon the previous solution, and also allow malicious
players who can arbitrarily deviate from the protocol in our FTL model. This is
much stronger than the semi-honest model where we assume that parties follow
the protocol precisely. We do so using the one of the practical MPC protocol
called SPDZ, thus our model can be efficiently extended to any number of
parties even in the case of a dishonest majority. In addition, the models
evaluated in our setting significantly outperform the previous work, in terms
of both runtime and communication cost. A single iteration in our model
executes in 0.8 seconds for the semi-honest case and 1.4 seconds for the
malicious case for 500 samples, as compared to 35 seconds taken by the previous
implementation.

leverages model-free policy optimization techniques to learn a linearizing
controller for a physical plant with unknown dynamics. Feedback linearization
is a technique from nonlinear control which renders the input-output dynamics
of a nonlinear plant \emph{linear} under application of an appropriate feedback
controller. Once a linearizing controller has been constructed, desired output
trajectories for the nonlinear plant can be tracked using a variety of linear
control techniques. However, the calculation of a linearizing controller
requires a precise dynamics model for the system. As a result, model-based
approaches for learning exact linearizing controllers generally require a
simple, highly structured model of the system with easily identifiable
parameters. In contrast, the model-free approach presented in this paper is
able to approximate the linearizing controller for the plant using general
function approximation architectures. Specifically, we formulate a
continuous-time optimization problem over the parameters of a learned
linearizing controller whose optima are the set of parameters which best
linearize the plant. We derive conditions under which the learning problem is
(strongly) convex and provide guarantees which ensure the true linearizing
controller for the plant is recovered. We then discuss how model-free policy
optimization algorithms can be used to solve a discrete-time approximation to
the problem using data collected from the real-world plant. The utility of the
framework is demonstrated in simulation and on a real-world robotic platform.

supercoiling in bacterial cells. Demixing of DNA from other globular
macromolecules results from the overall repulsion between all components of the
system and leads to the formation of the nucleoid, which is the region of the
cell that contains the genomic DNA in a rather compact form. Supercoiling
describes the coiling of the axis of the DNA double helix to accommodate the
torsional stress injected in the molecule by topoisomerases. Supercoiling is
able to induce some compaction of the bacterial DNA, although to a lesser
extent than demixing. In this paper, we investigate the interplay of these two
mechanisms, with the goal of determining whether the total compaction ratio of
the DNA is the mere sum or some more complex function of the compaction ratios
due to each mechanism. To this end, we developed a coarse-grained
bead-and-spring model and investigated its properties through Brownian dynamics
simulations. This work reveals that there actually exist different regimes,
depending on the crowder volume ratio and the DNA superhelical density. In
particular, a regime where the effects of DNA demixing and supercoiling on the
compaction of the DNA coil simply add up is shown to exist up to moderate
values of the superhelical density. In contrast, the mean radius of the DNA
coil no longer decreases above this threshold and may even increase again for
sufficiently large crowder concentrations. Finally, the model predicts that the
DNA coil may depart from the spherical geometry very close to the jamming
threshold, as a trade-off between the need to minimize both the bending energy
of the stiff plectonemes and the volume of the DNA coil to accommodate
demixing.

such as CrI$_3$ and CrCl$_3$ can be probed by forming tunnel barriers and
measuring their resistance as a function of magnetic field ($H$) and
temperature ($T$). This is possible because the tunneling magnetoresistance
originates from a spin-filtering effect sensitive to the relative orientation
of the magnetization in different layers, i.e., to the magnetic state of the
multilayers. For systems in which antiferromagnetism occurs within an
individual layer, however, no spin-filtering occurs: it is unclear whether this
strategy can work. To address this issue, we investigate tunnel transport
through atomically thin crystals of MnPS$_3$, a van der Waals semiconductor
that in the bulk exhibits easy-axis antiferromagnetic order within the layers.
For thick multilayers below $T\simeq 78$ K, a $T$-dependent magnetoresistance
sets-in at $\sim 5$ T, and is found to track the boundary between the
antiferromagnetic and the spin-flop phases known from bulk magnetization
measurements. The magnetoresistance persists down to individual MnPS$_3$
monolayers with nearly unchanged characteristic temperature and magnetic field
scales, albeit with a different dependence on $H$. We discuss the implications
of these finding for the magnetic state of atomically thin MnPS$_3$ crystals,
conclude that antiferromagnetic correlations persist down to the level of
individual monolayers, and that tunneling magnetoresistance does allow
magnetism in 2D insulating materials to be detected even in the absence of
spin-filtering.

can project speech segments into a latent code space where the distribution is
a simple diagonal Gaussian. Our preliminary investigation on the TIMIT database

network coding (AC-RLNC) algorithm with forward error correction. This
algorithm generalizes our joint optimization coding solution for point-to-point
communication with delayed feedback. AC-RLNC is adaptive to the estimated
channel condition, and is causal, as the coding adjusts the retransmission
rates using a priori and posteriori algorithms. In the multipath network, to
achieve the desired throughput and delay, we propose to incorporate an adaptive
packet allocation algorithm for retransmission, across the available resources
of the paths. This approach is based on a discrete water filling algorithm,
i.e., bit-filling, but, with two desired objectives, maximize throughput and
minimize the delay. In the multipath multi-hop setting, we propose a new
decentralized balancing optimization algorithm. This balancing algorithm
minimizes the throughput degradation, caused by the variations in the channel
quality of the paths at each hop. Furthermore, to increase the efficiency, in
terms of the desired objectives, we propose a new selective recoding method at
the intermediate nodes. We derive bounds on the throughput and the mean and
maximum in order delivery delay of AC-RLNC, both in the multipath and multipath
multi-hop case. In the multipath case, we prove that in the non-asymptotic
regime, the suggested code may achieve more than 90% of the channel capacity
with zero error probability. In the multipath multi-hop case, the balancing
procedure is proven to be optimal with regards to the achieved rate. Through
simulations, we demonstrate that the performance of our adaptive and causal
approach, compared to selective repeat (SR)-ARQ protocol, is capable of gains
up to a factor two in throughput and a factor of more than three in delay.

on the bidding strategy. In contrast, the objective of our research consists of
optimising RTB campaigns by finding out configurations that maximise both the
number of impressions and their average profitability. The experiments
demonstrate that, when the number of required visits by advertisers is low, it
is easy to find configurations with high average profitability, but as the
required number of visits increases, the average profitability tends to go
down. Additionally, configuration optimisation has been combined with other
interesting strategies to increase, even more, the campaigns' profitability.
Along with parameter configuration the study considers the following
complementary strategies to increase profitability: i) selecting multiple
configurations with a small number of visits instead of a unique configuration
with a large number, ii) discarding visits according to the thresholds of cost
and profitability, iii) analysing a reduced space of the dataset and
extrapolating the solution, and iv) increasing the search space by including
solutions below the required number of visits. The developed campaign
optimisation methodology could be offered by RTB platforms to advertisers to

dihedral angles of amino acids by viewing them as data on the torus. This has
motivated, over the past years, new proposals of distributions on the bivariate
torus. The main drawback of most of these models is that the related densities
are (pointwise) symmetric, despite the fact that the data usually present
asymmetric patterns. This motivates the need to find a new way of constructing
asymmetric toroidal distributions starting from a symmetric distribution. We
tackle this problem in this paper by introducing the sine-skewed toroidal
distributions. The general properties of the new models are derived. Based on
the initial symmetric model, explicit expressions for the shape parameters are
obtained, a simple algorithm for generating random numbers is provided, and
asymptotic results for the maximum likelihood estimators are established. An
important feature of our construction is that no normalizing constant needs to
be calculated, leading to more flexible distributions without increasing the
complexity of the models. The benefit of employing these new sine-skewed
distributions is shown on the basis of protein data, where, in general, the new
models outperform their symmetric antecedents.

problems in combinatorial optimization. The minimum spanning tree problem, the
two edge-connected spanning subgraph problem (2-ECSS) and the tree augmentation
problem (TAP) are all examples of fundamental well-studied network design tasks
that postulate different initial states of the network and different
assumptions on the reliability of network components. In this paper we motivate
and study \emph{Flexible Graph Connectivity} (FGC), a problem that mixes
together both the modeling power and the complexities of all aforementioned

allowing to specify different reliability levels for individual edges. While
this non-uniform nature of the problem makes it appealing from the modeling
perspective, it also renders most existing algorithmic tools for dealing with
network design problems unfit for approximating FGC.
  In this paper we develop a general algorithmic approach for approximating FGC
that yields approximation algorithms with ratios that are very close to the
best known bounds for many special cases, such as 2-ECSS and TAP. Our algorithm

have SDSS detection, while 1/3 of them is detected in X-rays, at a flux limit
of $\rm \sim 5 \times 10^{-15}\,erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}$. Our final sample
consists of 507 IR AGN with X-ray detection and optical spectra. Applying a
$\rm r-W2>6$ colour criterion, we find that the fraction of optically red AGN
drops from 43\% for those sources with SDSS detection to $23\%$ for sources

work employed a weighting scheme to downweight the contribution to shear
estimates from sources aligned with the PSF. This work removes the need to
downweight sources by convolving them with an image of the PSF rotated by
$90^{\circ}$. We show thats this successfully undoes the rotation caused by PSF
convolution, assuming we have reliable images of the PSF. We find that we can
accurately recover the input shear signal from a simulated Stage III-like weak
lensing data set using only the position angles to within an overall scale
factor, and that the scale factor can be determined using a cosmology
independent simulation with noise, galaxy, and PSF properties that match the

spike lasting for $\sim$10~s during the GOES C7.9 flare on 25 September 2011
(SOL2011-09-25T03:32) was only $\sim$2~ arcsec wide and $\sim$10~arcsec long.
Comparison with HMI magnetograms and AIA images at 1700~\AA~shows that the
X-ray emission was primarily from a long ribbon in the region of positive
polarity with little if any emission from the negative polarity ribbon.
However, a thermal plasma source density of $\sim$10$^{12}~cm^{-3}$ estimated
from the RHESSI-derived emission measure and source area showed that this could
best be interpreted as a coronal hard X-ray source in which the accelerated
electrons with energies lass than $\sim$50~keV were stopped by Coulomb
collisions in the corona, thus explaining the lack of the more usual bright
X-ray footpoints. Analysis of RHESSI spectra shows greater consistency with a
multi-temperature distribution and a low energy cutoff to the accelerated
electron spectrum of 22 keV compared to 12 keV if a single temperature
distribution is assumed. This leads to a change in the lower limit on the total
energy in electrons by an order of magnitude given the steepness of the
best-fit electron spectrum with a power-law index of $\sim$6.

there is no dedicated infrastructure such as gateways to watch and observe the
flowing information in the network, security of WSNs along with IoT is of a big
concern to the scientific community. Besides, recent integration and
collaboration of WSNs with IoT will open new challenges and problems in terms
of security. Hence, this would be a nightmare for the individuals using these
systems as well as the security administrators who are managing those networks.
Therefore, a detailed review of security attacks towards WSNs and IoT, along
with the techniques for prevention, detection, and mitigation of those attacks
are provided in this paper. In this text, attacks are categorized and treated

raw images taken on sky, together with PSF-fit source catalogs and transient

smartly compress the input size and speed up higher level tasks. A superpixel
was traditionally considered as a small cluster of square-based pixels that
have similar color intensities and are closely located to each other. In this
discrete model the boundaries of superpixels often have irregular zigzags
consisting of horizontal or vertical edges from a given pixel grid. However
digital images represent a continuous world, hence the following continuous
model in the resolution-independent formulation can be more suitable for the
reconstruction problem.
  Instead of uniting squares in a grid, a resolution-independent superpixel is
defined as a polygon that has straight edges with any possible slope at
subpixel resolution. The harder continuous version of the over-segmentation
problem is to split an image into polygons and find a best (say, constant)
color of each polygon so that the resulting colored mesh well approximates the

methodological challenges caused by the consistency of the semen sample. Thus,
there is a need for an improved methodology. We use modern and classical
machine learning techniques together with a dataset consisting of 85 videos of
human semen samples and related participant data to automatically predict sperm
motility. Used techniques include simple linear regression and more
sophisticated methods using convolutional neural networks. Our results indicate
that sperm motility prediction based on deep learning using sperm motility
videos is rapid to perform and consistent. The algorithms performed worse when
participant data was added. In conclusion, machine learning-based automatic
analysis may become a valuable tool in male infertility investigation and
research.

the Gleason score is a grading system used to measure the aggressiveness of
prostate cancer from the spatial organization of cells and the distribution of

from large interobserver and intraobserver variability. Previous work in deep
learning-based objective Gleason grading requires manual pixel-level

classification in tissue micro-arrays (TMA) using graph convolutional networks
(GCNs), in which we model the spatial organization of cells as a graph to
better capture the proliferation and community structure of tumor cells. As
node-level features in our graph representation, we learn the morphometry of
each cell using a contrastive predictive coding (CPC)-based self-supervised
approach. We demonstrate that on a five-fold cross validation our method can
achieve $0.9659\pm0.0096$ AUC using only TMA-level labels. Our method
demonstrates a 39.80\% improvement over standard GCNs with texture features and
a 29.27% improvement over GCNs with VGG19 features. Our proposed pipeline can

the highest redshift unlensed DSFG (and fourth most distant overall) found
to-date, and is the first source identified in a new 2mm blank-field map in the
COSMOS field. Though identified in prior samples of DSFGs at 850$\mu$m-1.2mm
with unknown redshift, the detection at 2mm prompted further follow-up as it
indicated a much higher probability that the source was likely to sit at $z>4$.
Deep observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter and submillimeter Array
(ALMA) presented here confirm the redshift through the secure detection of
$^{12}$CO($J\!=$6$\rightarrow$5) and
p-H$_{2}$O(2$_{1,1}\!\rightarrow$2$_{0,2}$). MAMBO-9 is comprised of a pair of
galaxies separated by 6kpc with corresponding star-formation rates of
590M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ and 220M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ total molecular hydrogen gas
mass of (1.7$\pm$0.4)$\times10^{11}$M$_\odot$, dust mass of
(1.3$\pm$0.3)$\times10^{9}$M$_\odot$ and stellar mass of
(3.2$^{+1.0}_{-1.5}$)$\times10^{9}$M$_\odot$. The total halo mass,
(3.3$\pm$0.8)$\times10^{12}$M$_\odot$, is predicted to exceed
$>10^{15}$M$_\odot$ by $z=0$. The system is undergoing a merger-driven
starburst which will increase the stellar mass of the system tenfold in
$\tau_{\rm depl}=40-80$Myr, converting its large molecular gas reservoir (gas
fraction of 96$^{+1}_{-2}$%) into stars. MAMBO-9 evaded firm spectroscopic
identification for a decade, following a pattern that has emerged for some of
the highest redshift DSFGs found. And yet, the systematic identification of
unlensed DSFGs like MAMBO-9 is key to measuring the global contribution of
obscured star-formation to the star-formation rate density at $z>4$, the
formation of the first massive galaxies, and the formation of interstellar dust
at early times ($<$1Gyr).

structure, equation of state, relative Mach number of the object's motion
through the gas, and density gradients across the gravitational focusing scale.
For each model, we measure coefficients of accretion and drag experienced by
the embedded object. These coefficients regulate the coupled evolution of the
object's masses and orbital tightening during the dynamical inspiral phase of
the common envelope. We extrapolate our simulation results to accreting black
holes with masses comparable to that of the population of LIGO black holes. We
demonstrate that the mass and spin accrued by these black holes per unit
orbital tightening are directly related to the ratio of accretion to drag
coefficients. We thus infer that the mass and dimensionless spin of initially
non-rotating black holes change by of order $1\%$ and 0.05, respectively, in a
typical example scenario. Our prediction that the masses and spins of black
holes remain largely unmodified by a common envelope phase aids in the
interpretation of the properties of the growing observed population of merging

task of monocular depth estimation. A model can be trained in a self-supervised
setting on stereo pairs of images, where depth (disparities) are an
intermediate result in a right-to-left image reconstruction pipeline. For the
quality of the image reconstruction and disparity prediction, a combination of
different losses is used, including L1 image reconstruction losses and
left-right disparity smoothness. These are local pixel-wise losses, while depth
prediction requires global consistency. Therefore, we extend the
self-supervised network to become a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), by
including a discriminator which should tell apart reconstructed (fake) images
from real images. We evaluate Vanilla GANs, LSGANs and Wasserstein GANs in
combination with different pixel-wise reconstruction losses. Based on extensive
experimental evaluation, we conclude that adversarial training is beneficial if
and only if the reconstruction loss is not too constrained. Even though
adversarial training seems promising because it promotes global consistency,
non-adversarial training outperforms (or is on par with) any method trained
with a GAN when a constrained reconstruction loss is used in combination with
batch normalisation. Based on the insights of our experimental evaluation we
obtain state-of-the art monocular depth estimation results by using batch

optimization framework for anticipatory resource allocation, where the future

optimization in a single step. An optimization problem is formulated to
integrate the implicit prediction and the policy optimization, based on the

problem depending on the joint distribution of future and historical

learn the proactive policy as a function of the past observations via
stochastic optimization. We take proactive caching and bandwidth allocation at
base stations as a concrete example, where the objective function is the
conditional expectation of successful offloading probability taken over the
future popularity given the historically observed popularity. We use simulation

spacing statistics of the coupled kicked tops and a perturbative description is
in good agreement with numerical results. The statistics of Schmidt eigenvalues
and entanglement entropies of eigenstates is found to follow a universal
scaling as well. Remarkably this is not only the case for large subsystems of
equal size but also if one of them is much smaller. For the entanglement

and with equal or better signal-to-noise ratio. These multi-dimensional arrays
are related to previously known, but relatively rarely employed,
one-dimensional integer Huffman sequences. Practical point-spread functions can
now be made sufficiently large to span the size of the object under measure.
Such large arrays can be applied to ghost imaging, which has demonstrated
potential to greatly improve signal-to-noise ratios and reduce the total dose
required for tomographic imaging. The discrete arrays built here parallel the
continuum self-adjoint or Hermitian functions that underpin wave theory and
quantum mechanics.

NLP, can be naturally modeled as extreme classification problems leading to
improved precision. However, such models are prohibitively expensive to train
due to the memory blow-up in the last layer. For example, a reasonable softmax
layer for the dataset of interest in this paper can easily reach well beyond
100 billion parameters (>400 GB memory). To alleviate this problem, we present
Merged-Average Classifiers via Hashing (MACH), a generic K-classification
algorithm where memory provably scales at O(logK) without any strong assumption
on the classes. MACH is subtly a count-min sketch structure in disguise, which
uses universal hashing to reduce classification with a large number of classes
to few embarrassingly parallel and independent classification tasks with a
small (constant) number of classes. MACH naturally provides a technique for
zero communication model parallelism. We experiment with 6 datasets; some
multiclass and some multilabel, and show consistent improvement over respective
state-of-the-art baselines. In particular, we train an end-to-end deep
classifier on a private product search dataset sampled from Amazon Search
Engine with 70 million queries and 49.46 million products. MACH outperforms, by
a significant margin,the state-of-the-art extreme classification models
deployed on commercial search engines: Parabel and dense embedding models. Our
largest model has 6.4 billion parameters and trains in less than 35 hours on a
single p3.16x machine. Our training times are 7-10x faster, and our memory
footprints are 2-4x smaller than the best baselines. This training time is also
significantly lower than the one reported by Google's mixture of experts (MoE)

derived in closed-form and the corresponding indexability is established. The
index is then generalized to incorporate stochastic, periodic packet arrivals

achieve near-optimal AoI but require heavy signaling overhead, a
contention-based random access scheme, namely Index-Prioritized Random Access

thus improving the access timeliness. A computer-based simulation shows that
IPRA's performance is close to the optimal AoI in this setting and outperforms
standard random access schemes. Also, for applications with hard AoI deadlines,

particle motion. In the Madelung representation the Schr\""{o}dinger equation
can be reformulated as the classical continuity and Euler equations of
classical fluid mechanics in the presence of a quantum potential, representing
the quantum hydrodynamical evolution equations. The equation of particle motion
can then be obtained from a Lagrangian similar to its classical counterpart.
After the reparametrization of the Lagrangian it turns out that the Finsler
metric describing the geometric properties of quantum hydrodynamics is a
Kropina metric. We present and discuss in detail the metric and the geodesic
equations describing the geometric properties of the quantum motion in the
presence of electromagnetic fields. As an application of the obtained formalism
we consider the Zermelo navigation problem in a quantum hydrodynamical system,
whose solution is given by a Kropina metric. The case of the Finsler
geometrization of the quantum hydrodynamical motion of spinless particles in
the absence of electromagnetic interactions is considered in detail, and the
Zermelo navigation problem for this case is also discussed.

applications and for our understanding of the interplay between wave phenomena
and the classical ray limit in the presence of chaotic dynamics and openness.
In strongly non-convex geometries, a theorem by Mather rules out the existence
of invariant curves in phase space corresponding to rays circulating in
whispering-gallery patterns, so that no corresponding modes of this type are
expected. Here we discuss numerical computations of the electromagnetic fields
in planar dielectric cavities that are strongly non-convex becausethey are
coupled to waveguides. We find a family of special states which retains many
features of the chaotic whispering-gallery modes known from convex shapes: an
intensity pattern corresponding to near-grazing incidence along extended parts
of the boundary, and comparatively high cavity Q factors. The modes are folded
into a figure-eight pattern, so overlap with the boundary is reduced in the
region of self-intersection. The modes combine the phenomenology of chaotic
whispering-gallery modes with an important technological advantage: the ability
to directly attach waveguides without spoiling the Q factor of the folded mode.
Using both a boundary-integral method and the FDTD technique, we explore the
dependence of the phenomenon on wavelength in relation to cavity size,
refractive-index contrast to the surrounding medium, and the degree of shape
deformation. A novel feature that distinguishes folded from regular whispering
gallery modes is that a given shape will support high-Q folded chaotic
whispering gallery modes only in certain wavelength windows.

explicit density (BSED) representation scheme for topology optimization of
stretchable metamaterials under finite deformation is proposed for the first
time. The proposed approach overcomes a key deficiency in existing
density-based optimization methods that typically yield designs that do not
have smooth surfaces but have large number of small intricate features, which
are difficult to manufacture even by additive manufacturing. In the proposed
approach, Bezier curves are utilized to describe the skeleton of the design
being optimized where the description of the entire design is realized by
assigning thickness along the curves. This geometric representation technique
ensures that the optimized design is smooth and concise and can easily be tuned
to be manufacturable by additive manufacturing. In the optimization method, the
density field is described by the Heaviside function defined on the Bezier
curves. Compared to NURBS or B-spline based models, Bezier curves have fewer
control parameters and hence are easier to manipulate for sensitivity
derivation, especially for distance sensitivities. Due to its powerful curve
fitting ability, using Bezier curve to represent density field allows exploring
design space effectively and generating concise structures without any
intricate small features at the borders. Furthermore, this density
representation method is mesh independent and design variables are reduced
significantly so that optimization problem can be solved efficiently using
small-scale optimization algorithms such as sequential quadratic programming.

the problem of noisy and often arbitrarily defined edges in real graphs. We
show that GDC is closely related to spectral-based models and thus combines the

demonstrate that replacing message passing with graph diffusion convolution
consistently leads to significant performance improvements across a wide range

many applications, one of the most essential tasks is to align two or more
networks to infer the similarities between cross-network vertices and discover
potential node-level correspondence. In this paper, we propose ELRUNA
(Elimination rule-based network alignment), a novel network alignment algorithm
that relies exclusively on the underlying graph structure. Under the guidance
of the elimination rules that we defined, ELRUNA computes the similarity
between a pair of cross-network vertices iteratively by accumulating the
similarities between their selected neighbors. The resulting cross-network
similarity matrix is then used to infer a permutation matrix that encodes the
final alignment of cross-network vertices. In addition to the novel alignment
algorithm, we also improve the performance of local search, a commonly used
post-processing step for solving the network alignment problem, by introducing
a novel selection method RAWSEM (Randomwalk based selection method) based on
the propagation of the levels of mismatching (defined in the paper) of vertices
across the networks. The key idea is to pass on the initial levels of
mismatching of vertices throughout the entire network in a random-walk fashion.
Through extensive numerical experiments on real networks, we demonstrate that
ELRUNA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art alignment methods in
terms of alignment accuracy under lower or comparable running time. Moreover,
ELRUNA is robust to network perturbations such that it can maintain a close to
optimal objective value under a high level of noise added to the original
networks. Finally, the proposed RAWSEM can further improve the alignment
quality with a less number of iterations compared with the naive local search
method.

the divers during various stages of an underwater mission. Despite recent
technological advancements, the existing systems and solutions for real-time

visibility, lighting variation, and the scarcity of salient features. The
difficulties are exacerbated by a host of non-linear image distortions caused
by the vulnerabilities of underwater light propagation (e.g.,
wavelength-dependent attenuation, absorption, and scattering). In this
dissertation, we present a set of novel and improved visual perception
