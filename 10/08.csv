groups via the operation $(x,y,z) \mapsto x y^{-1} z$. They are also ternary
self-distributive, and have a diagrammatic interpretation in terms of framed
links. Motivated by these properties, we define para-associative and heap
cohomology theories and also a ternary self-distributive cohomology theory with
abelian heap coefficients. We show that one of the heap cohomologies is related
to group cohomology via a long exact sequence. Moreover we construct maps
between second cohomology groups of normalized group cohomology and heap

second cohomology group. We proceed to study heap objects in symmetric monoidal
categories providing a characterization of pointed heaps as involutory Hopf

utilized in order to understand the structural dynamics at play, especially at
interfaces and defects, in the prototypical film of monolayer MoS2 under
electrical bias. Through our sample fabrication process, we clearly identify
the presence of mass transport in the presence of a lateral electric field. In
particular, we observe that the voids present at grain boundaries combine to
induce structural deformation. The electric field mediates a net vacancy flux
from the grain boundary interior to the exposed surface edge sites that leaves
molybdenum clusters in its wake. Following the initial biasing cycles, however,
the mass flow is largely diminished, and the resultant structure remains stable
over repeated biasing. We believe insights from this work can help explain
observations of non-uniform heating and preferential oxidation at grain
boundary sites in these materials.

well-known phenomena which is related to the high thermal conductivity of this
material. In this paper, we have shown that the heat diffusion along the tube
axis affects the macroscopic motion of SWCNT and adapting this phenomena to
coarse-grained model can improve the precision of the coarse-grained molecular
dynamics (CGMD) exceptionally. The nonlinear macroscopic motion of SWCNT in the
free thermal vibration condition in adiabatic environment is demonstrated in
the most simplified version of CG modeling as maintaining finite temperature
and total energy with suggested dissipation process derived from internal heat
diffusion. The internal heat diffusion related to the cross correlated momentum
from different potential energy functions is considered, and it can reproduce
the nonlinear dynamic nature of SWCNTs without external thermostatting in CG
model. Memory effect and thermostat with random noise distribution are not
included, and the effect of heat diffusion on memory effect is reviewed through
Mori-Zwanzig formalism. This diffusion shows perfect syncronization of the
motion between that of CGMD and MD simulation, which is started with initial
conditions from the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The heat diffusion
related to this process has shown the same dispersive characteristics to second
wave in SWCNT. This replication with good precision indicates that the internal
heat diffusion process is the essential cause of the nonlinearity of the tube.
The nonlinear dynamic characteristics from the various scale of simple beads
systems are examined with expanding its time step and node length
simultaneously.

from photospheric abundances, with a dependence on the first ionization

  Aims. We aim to build a method for optimal determination of FIP biases in the
corona from spectroscopic observations in a way that is in practice independent
from Differential Emission Measure (DEM) inversions.
  Methods. We optimised linear combinations of spectroscopic lines of low-FIP
and high-FIP elements so that the ratio of the corresponding radiances yields
the relative FIP bias with good accuracy for any DEM in a small set of typical
DEMs.
  Results. These optimised linear combinations of lines allow retrieval of a
test FIP bias map with good accuracy for all DEMs in the map. The results also
compare well with a FIP bias map obtained from observations using a
DEM-dependent method.
  Conclusions. The method provides a convenient, fast, and accurate way of
computing relative FIP bias maps. It can be used to optimise the use of
existing observations and the design of new observations and instruments.

revealed by ChMs analysis is the apparent inhomogeneity among stars belonging

However, this explanation is not supported by the uniformity in p-capture
elements of these stars. The HST survey has revealed that the GC NGC 3201 shows
an exceptionally wide coverage in the Delta(F275W,F814W) parameter of the ChM.
We present a chemical abundance analysis of 24 elements in 18 giants belonging
to the first population of this GC, and having a wide range in
Delta(F275W,F814W). As far as the p-capture elements are concerned, the
chemical abundances are typical of 1G stars, as expected from the location of
our targets in the ChM. Based on radial velocities and chemical abundances
arguments, we find that the three stars with the lowest Delta(F275W,F814W)
values are binary candidates. This suggests that, at least those stars could be
explained with binarity. These results are consistent with evidence inferred
from multi-band photometry that evolved blue stragglers populate the bluest
part of the 1G sequence in the ChM. The remaining 15 spectroscopic targets show
a small range in the overall metallicity by ~0.10 dex, with stars at higher
Delta(F275W,F814W) values having higher absolute abundances. We suggest that a
small variation in metals and binarity govern the color spread of the 1G in the

sequence.

elliptic flow difference, $\Delta v_{2}(A_{\rm ch})$, has been regarded as a
sensitive observable for the possible chiral magnetic wave (CMW) in
relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this work, we first demonstrate that, due
to non-flow backgrounds, the flow measurements by the Q-cumulant method using
all charged particles as reference introduce a trivial linear term to $\Delta
v_{2}(A_{\rm ch})$. The trivial slope can be negative in the triangle flow
difference $\Delta v_{3}(A_{\rm ch})$ if the non-flow is dominated by
back-to-back pairs. After eliminating the trivial term, we find that the
non-flow between like-sign pairs gives rise to an additional positive slope to
$\Delta v_{2}(A_{\rm ch})$ because of the larger dilution effect to $\pi^{+}$
($\pi^{-}$) at positive (negative) $A_{\rm ch}$. We further find that the
competition between different $\pi$ sources can introduce another non-trivial
linear-$A_{\rm ch}$ term due to their different multiplicity fluctuations and
anisotropic flows. We then study the effect of neutral cluster (resonance)
decays as a mechanism for local charge conservation on the slope parameter of
$\Delta v_{2}(A_{\rm ch})$. We find that the slope parameter is sensitive to
the kinematics of those neutral clusters. Light resonances give positive slopes
while heavy resonances give negative slopes. Local charge conservation from
continuum cluster mass distribution can give a positive slope parameter
comparable to experimental data. Our studies indicate that many non-CMW physics
mechanisms can give rise to a $A_{\rm ch}$-dependent $\Delta v_{2}(A_{\rm ch})$
and the interpretation of $\Delta v_{2}(A_{\rm ch})$ in terms of the CMW is
delicate.

channels has the potential of enabling mobility and reliability in scalable
mmWave systems. These gains attracted increasing interest in the last few
years. Prior work, however, has focused on extracting spatial channel
characteristics at the sub-6GHz band first and then use them to reduce the
mmWave beam training overhead. This approach has a number of limitations: (i)
It still requires a beam search at mmWave, (ii) its performance is sensitive to
the error associated with extracting the sub-6GHz channel characteristics, and
(iii) it does not normally account for the different dielectric properties at
the different bands. In this paper, we first prove that under certain
conditions, there exist mapping functions that can predict the optimal mmWave
beam and correct blockage status directly from the sub-6GHz channel, which
overcome the limitations in prior work. These mapping functions, however, are
hard to characterize analytically which motivates exploiting deep neural
network models to learn them. For that, we prove that a large enough neural
network can use the sub-6GHz channel to directly predict the optimal mmWave
beam and the correct blockage status with success probabilities that can be
made arbitrarily close to one. Then, we develop an efficient deep learning
model and empirically evaluate its beam/blockage prediction performance using
the publicly available dataset DeepMIMO. The results show that the proposed
solution can predict the mmWave blockages with more than 90$\%$ success
probability. Further, these results confirm the capability of the proposed deep
learning model in predicting the optimal mmWave beams and approaching the
optimal data rates, that assume perfect channel knowledge, while requiring no
beam training overhead...

continuum model of the antibody protein immunoglobulin G (IgG) using
Fluctuating Finite Element Analysis and identify the area of strongest
deformation. This region is essential to the torsional properties of the
molecule as a whole, as it represents the softest, most deformable domain. We
subject this part of the molecule to torques and stretching forces on an
atomistic level, using molecular dynamics simulations, in order to investigate
its torsional properties. We calculate the torsional resistance as a function
of the rotation of the domain, while subjecting it to various stretching
forces. We learn how these obtained torsion profiles evolve with increasing
stretching force and show that they exhibit torsion stiffening, which is in
qualitative agreement with experimental findings. We argue that combining the
torsion profiles for various stretching forces effectively results in a
combined force-torque spectroscopy analysis, which may serve as a mechanical
signature for the examined molecule.

niche merit over the conventional sensors for water vapour detection. Tubular
pores were replaced with normal cone for trace- and inverse cone for RH- level
detection. The normal conical pore was fabricated by sheer manipulation of
reaction rates of electrolytes, anodic polarization rate and time; and the
procedure made reversed in case of inverse cone structure. Sensor with normal
cone geometry exhibits response in ppm level with sensitivity of 13pF/ppm,
lower detection limit(LOD)~120 ppm with excellent response/recovery time.
Lowering LOD further requires alteration of conical geometric parameters in
tandem with kinetic theory of water vapour molecules. In contrast, sensor
developed from inverse conical structure shows response in RH level and LOD
touches down to even less than 20 RH% unlike 45 RH% in conventional RH sensors.
Linear response characteristics with sensitivity of 5.14 pF/RH%; surprisingly,
the limitations such as nonlinear response, large response recovery time and
high hysteresis as observed in conventional anodic alumina based humidity
sensors have been removed. Sensing mechanism in both the structures have been
suitably demonstrated and ratified with experimental data. Trace level
detection is interpreted with the statistical probabilistic approach in the
light of kinetic theory of gases and Brownian energy. A correlation between top
surface pore diameter (through which water molecule enters) and the optimized
mean free path of vapour molecule is established, and demonstrated its
effectiveness for humidity detection in trace level. Results are encouraging

constraining cosmological parameters. While galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements
usually rely on shear, weak-lensing magnification contains additional
constraining information. Using the fundamental plane (FP) of elliptical
galaxies to anchor the size distribution of a background population is one
method that has been proposed for performing a magnification measurement. We
present a formalism for using the FP residuals of elliptical galaxies to
jointly estimate the foreground mass and background redshift errors for a
stacked lens scenario. The FP residuals include information about weak-lensing
magnification $\kappa$, and therefore foreground mass, since to first order,
nonzero $\kappa$ affects galaxy size but not other FP properties. We also
present a modular, extensible code that implements the formalism using emulated
galaxy catalogs of a photometric galaxy survey. We find that combining FP
information with observed number counts of the source galaxies constrains mass
and photo-z error parameters significantly better than an estimator that
includes number counts only. In particular, the constraint on the mass is
17.0\% if FP residuals are included, as opposed to 27.7\% when only number
counts are included. The effective size noise for a foreground lens of mass
$M_H=10^{14}M_\odot$, with a conservative selection function in size and
surface brightness applied to the source population, is
$\sigma_{\kappa,\mathrm{eff}}=0.250$. We discuss the improvements to our FP
model necessary to make this formalism a practical companion to shear analyses

super-sample covariance than assumed in the literature and causes a substantial
leakage of Gaussian information. We decompose the covariance matrix into
several contributions that provide an insight into its behavior for different
biased tracers. We show that for realistic surveys, the covariance of power
spectrum multipoles is already dominated by shot noise and super survey mode
coupling in the weakly non-linear regime. Both these effects can be accurately
modeled analytically, making a perturbative treatment of the covariance very
compelling. Our method allows for the covariance to be varied as a function of
cosmology and bias parameters very efficiently, with survey geometry entering
as fixed kernels that can be computed separately using fast fourier transforms

about the large deviation rate. We present new phenomena in upper tail large
deviations for sparse random hypergraphs that are not seen in random graphs. We
conjecture a formula for the large deviation rate, i.e., the first order
asymptotics of the log-probability that the number of copies of fixed subgraph
$H$ in a sparse Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random $k$-uniform hypergraph exceeds its
expectation by a constant factor. This conjecture turns out to be significantly
more intricate compared to the case for graphs. We verify our conjecture when
the fixed subgraph $H$ being counted is a clique, as well as when $H$ is the
3-uniform 6-vertex 4-edge hypergraph consisting of alternating faces of an
octahedron, where new techniques are required.

Galerkin discretizations of the SN transport equation. This approach is
sweep-compatible: as the transport sweep is performed, a local quadratic
programming (QP) problem is solved in each spatial cell to ensure that the
solution satisfies certain physical constraints, including local particle
balance. The constraints can be chosen in two ways, leading to two variants of
the method: QP Zero (QPZ) and QP Maximum Principle (QPMP). The coefficients of
the solution are constrained to be nonnegative in QPZ, and they are constrained
by an approximate discrete maximum principle in QPMP. There are two primary
takeaways in this paper. First, it is shown that the QPMP method, when used
with the positive Bernstein basis, eliminates negativities, preserves
high-order accuracy for smooth problems, and significantly dampens unphysical
oscillations in the solution. The second takeaway is that the Variable
Eddington Factor (VEF) method can be used to accelerate the convergence of
source iteration with fixup for problems with optically thick regions.
Regardless of whether a fixup is applied, source iteration converges slowly
when optically thick regions are present and acceleration is needed. When VEF
is combined with fixed-up transport sweeps, the result is a scheme that
produces a nonnegative solution, converges independently of the mean free path,
and, in the case of the QPMP fixup, adheres to an approximate discrete maximum
principle.

their benefits in model-free RL, when employed using multi-step dynamic

$\kappa$-Value Iteration ($\kappa$-VI). These methods iteratively compute the
next policy ($\kappa$-PI) and value function ($\kappa$-VI) by solving a
surrogate decision problem with a shaped reward and a smaller discount factor.
We derive model-free RL algorithms based on $\kappa$-PI and $\kappa$-VI in
which the surrogate problem can be solved by any discrete or continuous action
RL method, such as DQN and TRPO. We identify the importance of a
hyper-parameter that controls the extent to which the surrogate problem is
solved and suggest a way to set this parameter. When evaluated on a range of
Atari and MuJoCo benchmark tasks, our results indicate that for the right range
of $\kappa$, our algorithms outperform DQN and TRPO. This shows that our
multi-step greedy algorithms are general enough to be applied over any existing

parameter $\varepsilon>0$ for (tangent) vector fields on a $2$-dimensional
Riemannian manifold $S$. As $\varepsilon\to 0$, these vector fields tend to
have unit length so they generate singular points, called vortices, of a
(non-zero) index if the genus $\mathfrak{g}$ of $S$ is different than $1$. Our
first main result concerns the characterization of canonical harmonic unit
vector fields with prescribed singular points and indices. The novelty of this
classification involves flux integrals constrained to a particular
vorticity-dependent lattice in the $2\mathfrak{g}$-dimensional space of
harmonic $1$-forms on $S$ if $\mathfrak{g}\geq 1$. Our second main result
determines the interaction energy (called renormalized energy) between vortex
points as a $\Gamma$-limit (at the second order) as $\varepsilon\to 0$. The
renormalized energy governing the optimal location of vortices depends on the
Gauss curvature of $S$ as well as on the quantized flux. The coupling between
flux quantization constraints and vorticity, and its impact on the renormalized
energy, are new phenomena in the theory of Ginzburg-Landau type models. We also
extend this study to two other (extrinsic) models for embedded hypersurfaces

the radius depends sensitively on several low-energy constants and their

puzzles in dealing with fermionic SPT(fSPT) phases. In this paper, we utilize
the Abelian Chern-Simons theory to study the fSPT phases protected by arbitrary
Abelian total symmetry $G_f$. Comparing to the bosonic SPT phases, fSPT phases
with Abelian total symmetry $G_f$ has three new features: (1) it may support

proper symmetry anomaly. In particular, we discover the construction of
Luttinger liquid edge theories with central charge $n-1$ for Type-III bosonic

below the SC transition at $T_c\simeq$10 K. The free-carrier component in the
optical conductivity is described by two Drude contributions; one strong and
broad, the other weak and narrow. The broad Drude component decreases
dramatically below $T_{\rm N}$ and $T_r$, with much of its strength being
transferred to a bound excitation in the mid-infrared, while the narrow Drude
component shows no anomalies at either of the transitions, actually increasing
in strength at low temperature while narrowing dramatically. The behavior of an

dramatic decrease in the low-frequency optical conductivity signals the
formation of a SC energy gap. ARPES reveals hole-like bands at the center of
the Brillouin zone (BZ), with both electron- and hole-like bands at the
corners. Below $T_{\rm N}$, the hole pockets at the center of the BZ decrease
in size, consistent with the behavior of the broad Drude component; while below

excitation in the optical conductivity at ~20 meV. The magnetic states, with
resulting SDW and charge-SDW order, respectively, lead to a significant
reconstruction of the Fermi surface that has profound implications for the
transport originating from the electron and hole pockets, but appears to have
relatively little impact on the SC in this material.

architecture choice in deep learning due to the increased training stability
and generalization performance with this architecture, although there has been
limited theoretical understanding for this improvement. In this work, we
analyze overparameterized deep residual networks trained by gradient descent
following random initialization, and demonstrate that (i) the class of networks
learned by gradient descent constitutes a small subset of the entire neural
network function class, and (ii) this subclass of networks is sufficiently
large to guarantee small training error. By showing (i) we are able to
demonstrate that deep residual networks trained with gradient descent have a
small generalization gap between training and test error, and together with
(ii) this guarantees that the test error will be small. Our optimization and
generalization guarantees require overparameterization that is only logarithmic
in the depth of the network, while all known generalization bounds for deep
non-residual networks have overparameterization requirements that are at least
polynomial in the depth. This provides an explanation for why residual networks
are preferable to non-residual ones.

which leads to inefficient utilization of model and data capacity. To overcome
this issue, recent works on deformation modeling seek to spatially reconfigure
the data towards a common arrangement such that semantic recognition suffers
less from deformation. This is typically done by augmenting static operators
with learned free-form sampling grids in the image space, dynamically tuned to
the data and task for adapting the receptive field. Yet adapting the receptive
field does not quite reach the actual goal -- what really matters to the
network is the ""effective"" receptive field (ERF), which reflects how much each
pixel contributes. It is thus natural to design other approaches to adapt the
ERF directly during runtime.
  In this work, we instantiate one possible solution as Deformable Kernels
(DKs), a family of novel and generic convolutional operators for handling
object deformations by directly adapting the ERF while leaving the receptive
field untouched. At the heart of our method is the ability to resample the
original kernel space towards recovering the deformation of objects. This
approach is justified with theoretical insights that the ERF is strictly
determined by data sampling locations and kernel values. We implement DKs as
generic drop-in replacements of rigid kernels and conduct a series of empirical
studies whose results conform with our theories. Over several tasks and
standard base models, our approach compares favorably against prior works that
adapt during runtime. In addition, further experiments suggest a working
mechanism orthogonal and complementary to previous works.

objects through their interaction with a gaseous environment. Aeolian-erosion
operates in a wide range of environments and under various conditions.
Aeolian-erosion has been extensively explored in the context of geophysics in
terrestrial planets. Here we show that aeolian-erosion of cobbles, boulders and
small planetesimals in protoplanetary-discs can constitute a significant
barrier for the early stages of planet formation. We use analytic calculations
to show that under the conditions prevailing in protoplanetary-discs small
bodies ($10-10^4 \rm{m}$) are highly susceptible to gas-drag aeolian-erosion.
At this size-range aeolian-erosion can efficiently erode the planetesimals down
to tens-cm size and quench any further growth of such small bodies. It thereby
raises potential difficulties for channels suggested to alleviate the
metre-size barrier. Nevertheless, the population of $\sim$decimetre-size
cobbles resulting from aeolian-erosion might boost the growth of larger (>km
size) planetesimals and planetary embryos through increasing the efficiency of
pebble-accretion, once/if such large planetesimals and planetary embryos exist

the radial profile of HI flux overdensity for MAMMOTH1-QSO, and find that
MAMMOTH1-QSO resides in a volume with significantly weak HI absorption. This
suggests that MAMMOTH1-QSO has a proximity zone where quasar illuminates and
photo-ionizes the surrounding HI gas and suppresses HI absorption, and that the
ELAN is probably a photo-ionized cloud embedded in the cosmic web. The HI
radial profile of MAMMOTH1-QSO is very similar to those of three neighbouring
type-I quasars at $z=2.3$, which is compatible with the AGN unification model.
We compare the distributions of the HI absorption and star-forming galaxies in
our survey volume, and identify a spatial offset between density peaks of
star-forming galaxies and HI gas. This segregation may suggest anisotropic UV
background radiation created by star-forming galaxy density fluctuations.

typical ionizing continua. While low-z Lya nebulae are larger and less
concentrated than compact, star-forming Green Pea galaxies, we find that they
resemble typical Type 2 AGN in terms of r-band concentration and size. Based on
this pilot study, low-z Lya nebulae appear to be a subset of Type 2 AGN with
bluer optical continua and high [OIII] equivalent widths but with comparable
sizes and similar [OIII] kinematics. These characteristics may simply reflect
the fact that low-z Lya nebulae are drawn from the high luminosity end of the
Type 2 AGN distribution, with higher nuclear activity driving higher [OIII]
equivalent widths and more central star formation leading to bluer optical
continua. Deeper spectroscopic follow-up of the full sample will shed further
light on these issues and on the relationship between these low-z Lya nebulae

achieve sensitivity to brown dwarf and planetary-mass companions ($\gtrsim2$

significant astrometric acceleration measured between the Hipparcos and Gaia

orbital motion of TW PsA around the barycenter of the Fomalhaut triple system.
Instead, we find that it is consistent with the reflex motion induced by an
orbiting substellar companion. The combination of astrometry, radial
velocities, and a deep $L^{\prime}$ imaging dataset leads to a constraint on
the companion mass of $1.2_{-0.6}^{+0.7}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$. However, the period of
the companion is poorly constrained, with a highly multi-modal period posterior
distribution due to aliasing with the 24.25 year baseline between Hipparcos and

magnetar spin-down, the implied ejecta mass is only ~1 M$_{\odot}$. SN2018don
also displays unusual properties -- in addition to its red colors and
comparatively massive host galaxy, the light curve undergoes some of the

photocenter of an unresolved AGN-host system will display astrometric jitter
that depends on the off-nucleus distance of the AGN, the total photometric
variability of the system, and the AGN-host contrast. Here we use the precision
astrometry from Gaia DR2 to constrain the off-nucleus population of a
low-redshift (0.3<z<0.8) sample of unobscured broad-line AGN drawn from the
SDSS with significant host contribution and photometric variability. We find
that Gaia DR2 already provides strong constraints on the projected off-nucleus
distance in the sub-kpc regime at these redshifts: 99%, 90% and 40% of AGN must
be well-centered to <1 kpc, <500 pc and <100 pc, respectively. Limiting the
sample to the most variable subset constrains >99% of AGN to be well-centered
below 500 parsec. These results suggest that genuine off-nucleus AGN (offset by
> a few hundred pc) must be rare at low redshift. Future Gaia releases of time
series of photocenter and flux measurements, improved treatments for extended

Hall effect as a direct probe of this transition when inversion symmetry is

transition is controlled by an exotic tilt-dependent line of critical points.
As this line is approached from the ordered side, the nonlinear Hall
conductivity is suppressed owing to the scattering between the strongly coupled
incoherent fermionic and bosonic excitations. Our results should motivate
further studies of nonlinear responses in strongly interacting Dirac materials.

the $H_0$-$\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ plane, (1) various constraints can be treated as
independently as possible, (2) single-sided constraints are easier to consider,
(3) compatibility among different constraints can be viewed in a more robust
way, (4) the model dependence of each constraint is clear, and (5) whether or
not a nonstandard model is able to reconcile all constraints in tension can be
seen more effectively. We perform a systematic comparison of different
constraints in the $H_0$-$\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ space based on a flat $\Lambda$CDM
model, treating them as separately as possible. Constraints along different
degeneracy directions consistently overlap in one region of the space, with the
local measurement from Cepheid variable-calibrated supernovae being the most
outlying, followed by the time-delay strong-lensing result. Considering the
possibility that some nonstandard physics may reconcile the constraints, we
provide a general discussion on nonstandard models with modifications at high,
mid, or low redshifts, and the effect of local environmental factors. Due to
the different responses of individual constraints to a modified model, it is
not easy for nonstandard models to reconcile all constraints if none of them
have unaccounted-for systematic effects.

the systems we have studied and other 2D systems suggests the existence of a
universal mechanism driving all to favor a similar series of packing
arrangements as the density is increased, but the simulations considered show
that the only such general rule proposed, namely the S\""uto theorem, is not a
necessary condition for the support of multiple distinct lattice structures by
a particular pair potential. We also find that close to the liquid-to-Kagome
phase transition the transient structured fluctuations in the liquid have
Kagome symmetry whereas deeper in the liquid phase the fluctuations have
hexagonal symmetry. As the deviation of the liquid density from the transition
density decreases fluctuations with hexagonal symmetry are replaced with those
with Kagome symmetry. When the transition is string phase-to-Kagome phase the
transient structured fluctuations in the string phase near the transition have
both six-fold and other than six-fold symmetries, with stronger preference for
six-fold symmetry in the Truskett system than in the Torquato system. The path
of the string-to-Kagome transition in the Truskett system involves intermediate
honeycomb configurations that subsequently buckle to form a Kagome lattice. The
path of the string-to-Kagome transition in the Torquato system suggests that
the Kagome phase is formed by coiled strings merging together; increasing
density generates a Kagome phase with imperfections such as 8-particle rings.

suggests that the depletion radius ranges from 0.02 to 0.15 pc, comparable with
the typical filament width (i.e.$\sim$0.1 pc). At these radii, the number
density of H$_2$ reaches values between 0.2 and 5.5$\times$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$.

beyond the snowline, respectively. We develop an Nbody integrator that
incorporates fragmentation and hit-and-run collisions, which is called D3

accretion in systems that host two gaseous giants like Jupiter and Saturn. We
compare two sets of 23 N-body simulations, one of which includes a realistic
collisional treatment and the other one models all impacts as perfect mergers.
The final masses of the HZ planets formed in runs with fragmentation are about
15\%-20\% smaller than those obtained without fragmentation. As for the class A
HZ planets, those formed in simulations without fragmentation experience very
significant increases in mass respect to their initial values, while the growth
of those produced in runs with fragmentation is less relevant. We remark that
the fragments play a secondary role in the masses of the class A HZ planets,
providing less than 30\% of their final values. In runs without fragmentation,
the final fraction of water of the class A HZ planets keeps the initial value
since they do not accrete water-rich embryos. In runs with fragmentation, the
final fraction of water of such planets strongly depends on the model used to
distribute the water after each collision. The class B HZ planets do not show
significant differences concerning their final water contents in runs with and
without fragmentation. From this, we find that the collisional fragmentation is
not a barrier to the survival of water worlds in the HZ.

H$\alpha$ morphology (concentrated, partially exposed, no-emission) and whether
they have neighboring clusters (which could affect the clearing timescales).
Through visual inspection of the HST images, and analysis of ages, reddenings,
and stellar masses from spectral energy distributions fitting, together with
the (U-B), (V-I) colors, we find: 1) the median ages indicate a progression
from concentrated (~3 Myr), to partially exposed (~4 Myr), to no H$\alpha$
emission (>5Myr), consistent with the expected temporal evolution of HII
regions and previous results. However, 2) similarities in the age distributions
for clusters with concentrated and partially exposed H$\alpha$ morphologies
imply a short timescale for gas clearing (<1Myr). 3) our cluster sample's
median mass is ~1000 M, and a significant fraction (~20%) contain one or more
bright red sources (presumably supergiants), which can mimic reddening effects.

clusters without H$\alpha$ emission are less reddened. To mitigate stochastic

the minimum spectral gap (min-gap) of the system Hamiltonian in the Ising-based
quantum annealer. The main argument we use in this paper to assess the
performance of a QA algorithm is the presence or absence of an anti-crossing
during quantum evolution. For this purpose, we introduce a new parametrization
definition of the anti-crossing. Using the Maximum-weighted Independent Set
(MIS) problem in which there are flexible parameters (energy penalties J
between pairs of edges) in an Ising formulation as the model problem, we
construct examples to show that by changing the value of J, we can change the
quantum evolution from one that has an anti-crossing (that results in an
exponential small min-gap) to one that does not have, or the other way around,
and thus drastically change (increase or decrease) the min-gap. However, we
also show that by changing the value of $J$ alone, one can not avoid the
anti-crossing. We recall a polynomial reduction from an Ising problem to an MIS
problem to show that the flexibility of changing parameters without changing
the problem to be solved can be applied to any Ising problem. As an example, we
show that by such a reduction alone, it is possible to remove the anti-crossing
and thus increase the min-gap. Our anti-crossing definition is necessarily
scaling invariant as scaling the problem Hamiltonian does not change the nature
(i.e. presence or absence) of an anti-crossing. As a side note, we show exactly
how the min-gap is scaled if we scale the problem Hamiltonian by a constant
factor.

toward higher values of $T_c$. Predictions based on state-of-the-art DFT for

showed the mechanism to be the electron-phonon interaction. This was confirmed
in optical spectroscopy measurements. For photon energies between $\sim 450$
and 600 meV in SH$_3$, the reflectance in the superconducting state is below
that in its normal state. This difference decreases as $T$ approaches $T_c$.
Decreasing absorption with increasing $T$ is opposite to what is expected in
ordinary metals. Such an anomalous behavior can be traced back to the energy
dependence of the superconducting density of states which is highly peaked at
the energy gap value $\Delta$ but decays back to the constant normal state
value as energy is increased, on a scale of a few $\Delta$, or by increasing
$T$ towards $T=T_c$. The process of phonon-assisted optical absorption is
encoded with a knowledge of the $T$-dependence of $\Delta$, the order parameter
of the superconducting state. Should the energy of the phonon involved be very
large, of order 200 meV or more, this process offers the possibility of
observing the closing of the superconducting order parameter with $T$ at
correspondingly very large energies. The very recent experimental observation
of a $T_c\simeq 250$ K in LaH$_{10}$ has further heightened interest in the
hydrides. We compare the relevant phonon structure seen in optics with related
features in the real and imaginary part of the frequency dependent gap,
quasiparticle density of states, reflectance, absorption, and optical
scattering rate. The phonon structures all carry information on the $T_c$ value
and the $T$-dependence of the order parameter, and can be used to confirm that
the mechanism involved in superconductivity is the electron-phonon interaction.

inner horizon of such black holes is singular in the Hartle-Hawking state. We
then consider BTZ black holes, where we show that our criterion for smoothness

from a remarkable conspiracy between the properties of mode-functions outside

exposes a data model and programming model for compositional video event
specification. Rekall represents video annotations from different sources

continuous volumes of spacetime in a video, and provides operators for
composing labels into queries that model new video events. We demonstrate the

of expensive integrands, wherein the integrand is emulated using a stochastic
process model. Several approaches have been put forward to encode sequential
adaptation (i.e. dependence on previous integrand evaluations) into this
framework. However, these proposals have been limited to either estimating the
parameters of a stationary covariance model or focusing computational resources
on regions where large values are taken by the integrand. In contrast, many
classical adaptive cubature methods focus computational resources on spatial
regions in which local error estimates are largest. The contributions of this
work are three-fold: First, we present a theoretical result that suggests there
does not exist a direct Bayesian analogue of the classical adaptive trapezoidal
method. Then we put forward a novel BC method that has empirically similar
behaviour to the adaptive trapezoidal method. Finally we present evidence that
the novel method provides improved cubature performance, relative to standard
BC, in a detailed empirical assessment.

attracted much interest as tools to provide experimentally driven information
about nuclear matrix elements of interest in the context of neutrinoless
double-beta decay. In this framework, a good description of the reaction
mechanism and a complete knowledge of the initial and final-state interactions
are mandatory. Presently, not enough is known about the details of the optical
potentials and nuclear response to isospin operators for many of the
projectile-target systems proposed for future DCE studies. Among these, the
20Ne + 76Ge DCE reaction is particularly relevant due to its connection with
76Ge double-beta decay. Purpose: We intend to characterize the initial-state
interaction for the 20Ne + 76Ge reactions at 306 MeV bombarding energy and
determine the optical potential and the role of the couplings between elastic
channel and inelastic transitions to the first low-lying excited states.
Methods: We determine the experimental elastic and inelastic scattering
cross-section angular distributions, compare the theoretical predictions by
adopting different models of optical potentials with the experimental data, and
evaluate the coupling effect through the comparison of the distorted-wave Born
approximation calculations with the coupled channels ones. Results: Optical
models fail to describe the elastic angular distribution above the grazing
angle (9.4{\deg}). A correction in the geometry to effectively account for
deformation of the involved nuclear systems improves the agreement up to about
14{\deg}. Coupled channels effects are crucial to obtain good agreement at
large angles in the elastic scattering cross section.

duality between inference and control, we develop the view of Optimal Control
as Input Estimation, devising a probabilistic stochastic optimal control
formulation that iteratively infers the optimal input distributions by
minimizing an upper bound of the control cost. Inference is performed through
Expectation Maximization and message passing on a probabilistic graphical model
of the dynamical system, and time-varying linear Gaussian feedback controllers
are extracted from the joint state-action distribution. This perspective
incorporates uncertainty quantification, effective initialization through
priors, and the principled regularization inherent to the Bayesian treatment.
Moreover, it can be shown that for deterministic linearized systems, our
framework derives the maximum entropy linear quadratic optimal control law. We
provide a complete and detailed derivation of our probabilistic approach and

between the relative momentum of the two-body problem, the classical limit of

relationships allow us to compute observables for generic orbits (such as the
periastron advance $\Delta\Phi$) through analytic continuation, via a radial
action depending only on boundary data. A simplified (more geometrical) map can
be obtained for circular orbits, enabling us to extract the orbital frequency
as a function of the (conserved) binding energy, $\Omega(E)$, directly from
scattering information. As an example, using the results in Bern et al.
[1901.04424, 1908.01493], we readily derive $\Omega(E)$ and $\Delta\Phi(J,E)$
to two-loop orders. We also provide closed-form expressions for the orbital
frequency and periastron advance at tree-level and one-loop order,
respectively, which capture a series of exact terms in the Post-Newtonian
expansion. We then perform a partial PM resummation, using a ""no-recoil""
approximation for the amplitude. This limit is behind the map between the
scattering angle for a test-particle and the two-body dynamics to 2PM. We show
that it also captures a subset of higher order terms beyond the test-particle
limit. While a (rather lengthy) Hamiltonian may be derived as an intermediate
step, our map applies directly between gauge invariant quantities. Our findings
provide a starting point for an alternative approach to the binary problem. We

representations. However, is a good representation itself sufficient for sample
efficient reinforcement learning? This question has largely been studied only
with respect to (worst-case) approximation error, in the more classical
approximate dynamic programming literature. With regards to the statistical
viewpoint, this question is largely unexplored, and the extant body of
literature mainly focuses on conditions which permit sample efficient
reinforcement learning with little understanding of what are necessary
conditions for efficient reinforcement learning.
  This work shows that, from the statistical viewpoint, the situation is far
subtler than suggested by the more traditional approximation viewpoint, where
the requirements on the representation that suffice for sample efficient RL are
even more stringent. Our main results provide sharp thresholds for
reinforcement learning methods, showing that there are hard limitations on what
constitutes good function approximation (in terms of the dimensionality of the
representation), where we focus on natural representational conditions relevant
to value-based, model-based, and policy-based learning. These lower bounds
highlight that having a good (value-based, model-based, or policy-based)
representation in and of itself is insufficient for efficient reinforcement
learning, unless the quality of this approximation passes certain hard
thresholds. Furthermore, our lower bounds also imply exponential separations on
the sample complexity between 1) value-based learning with perfect
representation and value-based learning with a good-but-not-perfect
representation, 2) value-based learning and policy-based learning, 3)
policy-based learning and supervised learning and 4) reinforcement learning and

profiles using NHANES data. Phthalates are a family of industrial chemicals

health effects of exposure to phthalates on reproduction and neuro-development,
and concern about racial disparities in exposure. We would like to identify a
single set of low-dimensional factors summarizing exposure to different
chemicals, while allowing differences across groups. Improving on current
multi-group additive factor models, we propose a class of Perturbed Factor
Analysis (PFA) models that assume a common factor structure after perturbing
the data via multiplication by a group-specific matrix. Bayesian inference
algorithms are defined using a matrix normal hierarchical model for the
perturbation matrices. The resulting model is just as flexible as current
approaches in allowing arbitrarily large differences across groups but has
substantial advantages that we illustrate in simulation studies. Applying PFA
to NHANES data, we learn common factors summarizing exposures to phthalates,
while showing clear differences across groups.

coplanar orbit with eccentricity e between 0.1 and 0.6. For these

is, ignoring differential rotation and the curvature of the orbit, provide
simple analytical expressions for the rates of energy and angular momentum
exchange between the disk and the companion. We examine the range of validity
of the dynamical friction approach by conducting a series of hydrodynamical
simulations of a perturber with softening radius R_soft embedded in a
two-dimensional disk. We find close agreement between predictions and the
values in simulations provided that R_soft is chosen sufficiently small, below
a threshold value Rtilde_soft, which depends on the disk parameters and on
eccentricity. We give Rtilde_soft for both razor-thin disks and disks with a
finite scaleheight. For point-like perturbers, the local approximation is valid
if the accretion radius is smaller than Rtilde_soft. This condition imposes an
upper value on the mass of the perturber.

However, in-depth questions regarding the impact of code (re-)randomization on

convergence to defeat JIT-ROP attacks?; how do starting pointers in JIT-ROP

evolution. Under the assumption that the jets carry about ten percent of the

of the binding energy of the gas in the galaxy/bulge. Therefore, the jets that
the SMS progenitor of the SMBH launches carry sufficient energy to establish a
feedback cycle with the gas in the inner zone of the galaxy/bulge, and hence,
set a relation between the total stellar mass and the mass of the SMS. As the
SMS collapses to form the SMBH at the center, there is already a relation
(correlation) between the newly born SMBH mass and the stellar mass of the

the collapsing SMS and launches very energetic jets that might unbind most of

the theory of cosmic ray self confinement, the waves are generated by
instabilities driven by the cosmic rays themselves. The dominant instability is
due to bulk motion, or streaming, of the cosmic rays, parallel to the
background magnetic field B, and transfers cosmic ray momentum and energy to
the thermal gas as well as confining the cosmic rays. Classical arguments and
recent numerical simulations show that self confinement due to the streaming
instability breaks down unless the cosmic ray pressure and thermal gas density
gradients parallel to B are aligned, a condition which is unlikely to always be
satisfied We investigate an alternative mechanism for cosmic ray self

time-dependent domains in an Eulerian coordinate framework. Our work can be
seen as an extension of a recent paper by Lehrenfeld & Olshanskii [ESAIM: M2AN,
53(2):585-614, 2019], where BDF-type time-stepping schemes are studied for a
parabolic equation on moving domains. For space discretisation, a geometrically
unfitted finite element discretisation is applied in combination with Nitsche's
method to impose boundary conditions. Physically undefined values of the
solution at previous time-steps are extended implicitly by means of so-called
ghost penalty stabilisations. We derive a complete a priori error analysis of
the discretisation error in space and time, including optimal $L^2(L^2)$-norm
error bounds for the velocities. Finally, the theoretical results are
substantiated with numerical examples.

relationships among variables in a dataset. A causal graph can be generated
from a dataset using a particular causal algorithm, for instance, the PC
algorithm or Fast Causal Inference (FCI). Generating a causal graph from a
dataset that contains different data types (mixed data) is not trivial. This
research offers an easy way to handle the mixed data so that it can be used to
learn causal graphs using the existing application of the PC algorithm and FCI.
This research proposes using kernel functions and Kernel Alignment to handle
mixed data. Two main steps of this approach are computing a kernel matrix for
each variable and calculating a pseudo-correlation matrix using Kernel
Alignment. Kernel Alignment is used as a substitute for the correlation matrix
for the conditional independence test for Gaussian data in the PC Algorithm and
FCI. The advantage of this idea is that is possible to handle any data type by
using a suitable kernel function to compute a kernel matrix for an observed
variable. The proposed method is successfully applied to learn a causal graph
from mixed data containing categorical, binary, ordinal, and continuous
variables.

the symbol duration is relatively short, adapting the cyclic prefix (CP)
duration rather than using a fixed one may significantly improve the spectral
efficiency while preventing inter-symbol interference (ISI). In practice, it
may be beneficial to have a constant overall DFT-spread-OFDM/OFDM symbol time,
which is the sum of the duration of a CP and the duration of a data portion. We
propose to adapt the CP duration to the delay spread without changing the
overall symbol time for DFT-spread-OFDM or OFDM, and address implementation
challenges. In particular, we propose changing the clocking rate of ADC and DAC
or using a Farrow filter to reduce the computational complexity of
arbitrary-size DFT/IDFT resulting from the adaptation.

Our method is evaluated on three tasks that require agents to combine local and

high-performance out-of-order cores. While DRAM latency has remained nearly the
same over many generations, DRAM bandwidth has grown significantly due to
higher frequencies, newer architectures (DDR4, LPDDR4, GDDR5) and 3D-stacked
memory packaging (HBM). Current state-of-the-art prefetchers do not do well in
extracting higher performance when higher DRAM bandwidth is available.
Prefetchers need the ability to dynamically adapt to available bandwidth,
boosting prefetch count and prefetch coverage when headroom exists and
throttling down to achieve high accuracy when the bandwidth utilization is
close to peak. To this end, we present the Dual Spatial Pattern Prefetcher
(DSPatch) that can be used as a standalone prefetcher or as a lightweight
adjunct spatial prefetcher to the state-of-the-art delta-based Signature
Pattern Prefetcher (SPP). DSPatch builds on a novel and intuitive use of
modulated spatial bit-patterns. The key idea is to: (1) represent program
accesses on a physical page as a bit-pattern anchored to the first ""trigger""
access, (2) learn two spatial access bit-patterns: one biased towards coverage
and another biased towards accuracy, and (3) select one bit-pattern at run-time
based on the DRAM bandwidth utilization to generate prefetches. Across a
diverse set of workloads, using only 3.6KB of storage, DSPatch improves
performance over an aggressive baseline with a PC-based stride prefetcher at
the L1 cache and the SPP prefetcher at the L2 cache by 6% (9% in
memory-intensive workloads and up to 26%). Moreover, the performance of
DSPatch+SPP scales with increasing DRAM bandwidth, growing from 6% over SPP to
10% when DRAM bandwidth is doubled.

Gaia ($G$) to discriminate between dwarf and giant stars and to estimate their

[Fe/H]$<-1.2$, the algorithm succeeds in identifying more than 70% of the
giants in the training/test set, with a dwarf contamination fraction below 30%

have uncertainties better than 0.2 dex when compared with the spectroscopic

distance of at least $\sim 80$ kpc without requiring any prior on the stellar
distribution, and have fully independent uncertainities that take into account
both random and systematic errors. These advances allow us to estimate these
stellar parameters for approximately 12 million stars in the photometric
dataset. This will enable studies involving the chemical mapping of the distant
outer disc and the stellar halo, including their kinematics using the Gaia
proper motions. This type of algorithm can be applied in the Southern
hemisphere to the first release of LSST data, thus providing an almost complete
view of the external components of our Galaxy out to at least $\sim 80$ kpc.
Critical to the success of these efforts will be ensuring well-defined

the precise control of scattering properties and magnetoassociation of ErYb

opportunities for mass scaling of interactions. Uniquely, two isotopic

Though it is the subject of frequent studies, it is not known how this
representation changes across training directions, or how changes in reach
direction and the corresponding changes in limb impedance, influence
measurements of it. We ran a force field adaptation experiment using eight
groups of subjects each trained on one of eight standard directions and then
tested for generalization in the remaining seven directions. Generalization in
all directions was local and asymmetric, providing limited and unequal transfer
to the left and right side of the trained target. These asymmetries were not
consistent in either magnitude or direction even after correcting for changes
in limb impedance, at odds with previous explanations. Relying on a standard
model for generalization the inferred representations inconsistently shifted to
one side or the other of their respective training direction. A second model
that accounted for limb impedance and variations in baseline trajectories
explained more data and the inferred representations were centered on their

there has recently been much interest in passive linear optics quantum
computing, which includes boson-sampling, as this model eliminates the
highly-challenging requirements for feed-forward via fast, active control. That
is, these systems are passive by definition. In usual scenarios, error
detection and correction techniques are inherently active, making them
incompatible with this model, arousing suspicion that physical error processes

techniques enables the suppression of dephasing noise on photonic qubits via
simple fan-out style operations, implemented by optical Fourier transform
networks, which can be readily realised today. The protocol effectively maps
dephasing noise into heralding failures, with zero failure probability in the

work on the modularity of generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants counting
D4-D2-D0 brane bound states in type IIA strings on a Calabi-Yau threefold
$\mathfrak{Y}$, we construct the modular completion of generating functions of
refined BPS indices supported on a divisor class. Although for compact
$\mathfrak{Y}$ the refined indices are not protected, switching on the
refinement considerably simplifies the construction of the modular completion.
Furthermore, it leads to a non-commutative analogue of the TBA equations, which
suggests a quantization of the moduli space consistent with S-duality. In
contrast, for a local CY threefold given by the total space of the canonical
bundle over a complex surface $S$, refined BPS indices are well-defined, and
equal to Vafa-Witten invariants of $S$. Our construction provides a modular
completion of the generating function of these refined invariants for arbitrary
rank. In cases where all reducible components of the divisor class are
collinear (which occurs e.g. when $b_2(\mathfrak{Y})=1$, or in the local case),
we show that the holomorphic anomaly equation satisfied by the completed
generating function truncates at quadratic order. In the local case, it agrees
with an earlier proposal by Minahan et al for unrefined invariants, and extends
it to the refined level using the afore-mentioned non-commutative structure.
Finally, we show that these general predictions reproduce known results for
$U(2)$ and $U(3)$ Vafa-Witten theory on $\mathbb{P}^2$, and make them explicit
for $U(4)$.

(CI) precoding technique in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO)

Firstly, analytical expressions for the moment generating function (MGF) and
the average of the received signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) are derived. Then,
based on the derived MGF expression the average symbol error probability (SEP)
for the CI precoder with PSK signaling is calculated. In this regard, new exact
and very accurate asymptotic approximation for the average SEP are provided.
Building on the new performance analysis, different power allocation schemes
are considered to enhance the achieved SEP. In the first scheme, power
allocation based on minimizing the sum symbol error probabilities (Min-Sum) is
studied, while in the second scheme the power allocation based on minimizing
the maximum SEP (Min-Max) is investigated. Furthermore, new analytical
expressions of the throughput and power efficiency of the CI precoding in

demonstrate that, the CI precoding outperforms the conventional interference
suppression precoding techniques with an up to 20dB gain in the transmit SNR in
terms of SEP, and up to 15dB gain in the transmit SNR in terms of the
throughput. In addition, the SEP-based power allocation schemes provide
additional up to 13dB gains in the transmit SNR compared to the conventional
equal power allocation scheme.

state-of-the-art deep learning in mobile and edge settings where the
computation and energy budgets are highly limited. Recently, Liu et al. (2019)
framed the search of efficient neural architectures into a continuous splitting
process: it iteratively splits existing neurons into multiple off-springs to
achieve progressive loss minimization, thus finding novel architectures by
gradually growing the neural network. However, this method was not specifically
tailored for designing energy-efficient networks, and is computationally
expensive on large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we substantially improve Liu
et al. (2019) in two significant ways: 1) we incorporate the energy cost of
splitting different neurons to better guide the splitting process, thereby
discovering more energy-efficient network architectures; 2) we substantially
speed up the splitting process of Liu et al. (2019), which requires expensive
eigen-decomposition, by proposing a highly scalable Rayleigh-quotient
stochastic gradient algorithm. Our fast algorithm allows us to reduce the
computational cost of splitting to the same level of typical back-propagation
updates and enables efficient implementation on GPU. Extensive empirical
results show that our method can train highly accurate and energy-efficient
networks on challenging datasets such as ImageNet, improving a variety of

sight, has proven to be an efficient method for constraining models of
structure formation and reveal the nature of dark energy. So far, most
weak-lensing studies have focused on the shear field that can be measured
directly from the ellipticity of background galaxies. However, within the
context of forthcoming full-sky weak-lensing surveys such as Euclid,
convergence maps (mass maps) offer an important advantage over shear fields in
terms of cosmological exploitation. While it carry the same information, the
lensing signal is more compressed in the convergence maps than in the shear
field. This simplifies otherwise computationally expensive analyses, for
instance, non-Gaussianity studies. However, the inversion of the non-local
shear field requires accurate control of systematic effects caused by holes in
the data field, field borders, shape noise, and the fact that the shear is not
a direct observable (reduced shear). We present the two mass-inversion methods
that are included in the official Euclid data-processing pipeline: the standard
Kaiser & Squires method (KS), and a new mass-inversion method (KS+) that aims
to reduce the information loss during the mass inversion. This new method is
based on the KS method and includes corrections for mass-mapping systematic
effects. The results of the KS+ method are compared to the original
implementation of the KS method in its simplest form, using the Euclid Flagship
mock galaxy catalogue. In particular, we estimate the quality of the
reconstruction by comparing the two-point correlation functions and third- and
fourth- order moments obtained from shear and convergence maps, and we analyse
each systematic effect independently and simultaneously...

induced by the ($^{18}$O, $^{16}$O) reaction on different targets has been
performed. The high resolution data have been collected at the MAGNEX magnetic
spectrometer of the INFN-LNS laboratory in Catania and analyzed with the
coupled reaction channel (CRC) approach. The simultaneous and sequential
transfers of the two neutrons have been considered under the same theoretical
framework without the need of adjustable factors in the calculations.
  Purpose: A detailed analysis of the one-neutron transfer cross sections is
important to study the sequential two-neutron transfer. Here, we examine the
($^{18}$O, $^{17}$O) reaction on $^{16}$O, $^{28}$Si and $^{64}$Ni targets.
These even-even nuclei allow for investigation of one-neutron transfer in
distinct nuclear shell spaces.
  Method: The MAGNEX spectrometer was used to measure mass spectra of ejectiles
and extract differential cross sections of one-neutron transfer to low-lying
states. We adopted the same CRC formalism used in the sequential two-neutron
transfer, including relevant channels and using spectroscopic amplitudes
obtained from shell model calculations. We also compare with one-step distorted
wave Born approximation (DWBA).
  Results: For the $^{18}$O + $^{16}$O and the $^{18}$O + $^{28}$O systems we
used two interactions in the shell model. The experimental angular
distributions are reasonably well reproduced by the CRC calculations. In the
$^{18}$O + $^{64}$Ni system, we considered only one interaction and the
theoretical curve describes the shape and order of magnitude observed in the
experimental data.
  Conclusions: Comparisons between experimental, DWBA and CRC angle-integrated
cross sections suggest that excitations before or after the transfer of neutron
is relevant in the $^{18}$O + $^{16}$O and $^{18}$O + $^{64}$Ni systems.

applications. However, the theory is mainly developed assuming that the model
is stationary with time invariant parameters. This is at odds with the
prevalent evidence for parameter instability in economic time series, but
theories for parameter instability are mainly developed for models with a small
number of covariates. In this paper, we present two $L_2$ boosting algorithms
for estimating high dimensional models in which the coefficients are modeled as
functions evolving smoothly over time and the predictors are locally
stationary. The first method uses componentwise local constant estimators as
base learner, while the second relies on componentwise local linear estimators.
We establish consistency of both methods, and address the practical issues of
choosing the bandwidth for the base learners and the number of boosting
iterations. In an extensive application to macroeconomic forecasting with many
potential predictors, we find that the benefits to modeling time variation are
substantial and they increase with the forecast horizon. Furthermore, the
timing of the benefits suggests that the Great Moderation is associated with
substantial instability in the conditional mean of various economic series.

decay to the equilibrium Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution through relative

means of a conservative hybrid spectral and discontinuous Galerkin scheme
adapted from previous work. More precisely, the Coulomb case shows that there
is a degenerate spectrum, with a decay rate close to the law of two thirds
predicted by upper estimates in a work of Strain and Guo in 2006, while the
Maxwell type and hard sphere examples both exhibit a spectral gap as predicted
by Desvillettes and Villani in 2000. Such decay rate behavior indicates that
the analytical estimates for the Coulomb case is sharp while, still to this

the Fokker-Planck-Landau operator.

recently proposed by \citet{yeung18}. We conclude that isosurface areas scale
with the square root of the Taylor P\'eclet number $Pe_{\lambda}$ between
approximately 50 and 4429 with some departure from power law scaling evident
for $2.4 < Pe_{\lambda} < 50$. No independent effect of either $Re_{\lambda}$
or $Sc$ is observed. The excellent scaling of area with $Pe_{\lambda}^{1/2}$
occurs even though the probability density function (p.d.f.) of the scalar
gradient is very close to exponential for $Re_{\lambda}=98$ but approximately
lognormal when $Re_{\lambda}=633$.

the potential of its collective use for novel applications. Achieving
interoperability through the full transformation and integration of diverse
data structures remains an ideal that is hard, if not impossible, to achieve.
Instead, methods that can simultaneously interpret different types of data
available in different data structures and formats have been explored. On the
other hand, many query languages have been designed to enable users to interact
with the data, from relational, to object-oriented, to hierarchical, to the
multitude emerging NoSQL languages. Therefore, the interoperability issue could
be solved not by enforcing physical data transformation, but by looking at
techniques that are able to query heterogeneous sources using one uniform
language. Both industry and research communities have been keen to develop such
techniques, which require the translation of a chosen 'universal' query
language to the various data model specific query languages that make the
underlying data accessible. In this article, we survey more than forty query
translation methods and tools for popular query languages, and classify them
according to eight criteria. In particular, we study which query language is a
most suitable candidate for that 'universal' query language. Further, the
results enable us to discover the weakly addressed and unexplored translation
paths, to discover gaps and to learn lessons that can benefit future research

Here the steady-state motion of the fountain is analyzed experimentally and
theoretically. Measurements are given for the speeds and heights for three
different chains and three different distances from the container to the floor.
It is shown theoretically that the distance the chain rises above the container
is proportional to the force from the container on the chain. The basic physics

developed for how the chain interacts with the container. This model shows that

uncertainty quantification. DNN performance is affected by the volume and the

outputting accurate predictions, especially when out-of-domain molecules are

been proposed, most of which are based on approximate Bayesian inference. Among
these, only a few scale to the large datasets required in applications.
Evaluating and comparing these methods has recently attracted great interest,
but results are generally fragmented and absent for molecular property
prediction. In this paper, we aim to quantitatively compare scalable techniques
for uncertainty estimation in GCNNs. We introduce a set of quantitative
criteria to capture different uncertainty aspects, and then use these criteria
to compare MC-Dropout, deep ensembles, and bootstrapping, both theoretically in
a unified framework that separates aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty and

the different uncertainty estimation methods and their impact on
uncertainty-related error reduction. Our findings indicate that ensembling and

to crop growth and yield. As the atmosphere warms without additional water
vapor input, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) increases as well. Increased
temperatures and accompanied elevated VPD levels can both lead to negative
impacts on crop yield. The independent importance of VPD, however, is often
neglected or conflated with that from temperature due to a tight correlation
between the two climate factors. We used a coupled process-based crop (MAIZSIM)
and soil (2DSOIL) model to gain a mechanistic understanding of the independent
roles temperature and VPD play in crop yield projections, as well as their
interactions with rising CO2 levels and changing precipitation patterns. We
found that by separating out the VPD effect from rising temperatures, VPD
increases had a greater negative impact on yield compared to that from warming.
The negative impact of these two factors varied with precipitation levels and
influenced yield through separate mechanisms. Warmer temperatures caused yield
loss mainly through shortening the growing season, while elevated VPD increased
water loss and triggered several water stress responses such as reduced
photosynthetic rates, lowered leaf area development, and shortened growing
season length. Elevated CO2 concentrations partially alleviated yield loss
under warming or increased VPD conditions through water savings, but the impact
level varied with precipitation levels and was most pronounced under drier
conditions. These results demonstrate the key role VPD plays in crop growth and
yield, displaying a magnitude of impact comparative to temperature and CO2. A
mechanistic understanding of the function of VPD and its relation with other
climate factors and management practices is critical to improving crop yield

  Networks","11 pages, 6 figures, accepted as a long paper at EMNLP 2019",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Semantic role labeling (SRL) involves extracting propositions (i.e.
predicates and their typed arguments) from natural language sentences.
State-of-the-art SRL models rely on powerful encoders (e.g., LSTMs) and do not
model non-local interaction between arguments. We propose a new approach to
modeling these interactions while maintaining efficient inference.
Specifically, we use Capsule Networks: each proposition is encoded as a tuple
of \textit{capsules}, one capsule per argument type (i.e. role). These tuples
serve as embeddings of entire propositions. In every network layer, the
capsules interact with each other and with representations of words in the
sentence. Each iteration results in updated proposition embeddings and updated
predictions about the SRL structure. Our model substantially outperforms the
non-refinement baseline model on all 7 CoNLL-2019 languages and achieves
state-of-the-art results on 5 languages (including English) for dependency SRL.
We analyze the types of mistakes corrected by the refinement procedure. For
example, each role is typically (but not always) filled with at most one
argument. Whereas enforcing this approximate constraint is not useful with the
modern SRL system, iterative procedure corrects the mistakes by capturing this
intuition in a flexible and context-sensitive way.

that obtains good performance on normal data but behaves maliciously on data
samples with certain trigger patterns. Several approaches have been proposed to
detect such attacks, but they make undesirable assumptions about the attack
strategies or require direct access to the trained models, which restricts
their utility in practice.
  This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a Meta Neural Trojan
Detection (MNTD) pipeline that does not make assumptions on the attack
strategies and only needs black-box access to models. The strategy is to train
a meta-classifier that predicts whether a given target model is Trojaned. To
train the meta-model without knowledge of the attack strategy, we introduce a
technique called jumbo learning that samples a set of Trojaned models following
a general distribution. We then dynamically optimize a query set together with
the meta-classifier to distinguish between Trojaned and benign models.
  We evaluate MNTD with experiments on vision, speech, tabular data and natural
language text datasets, and against different Trojan attacks such as data
poisoning attack, model manipulation attack, and latent attack. We show that
MNTD achieves 97% detection AUC score and significantly outperforms existing
detection approaches. In addition, MNTD generalizes well and achieves high
detection performance against unforeseen attacks. We also propose a robust MNTD
pipeline which achieves 90% detection AUC even when the attacker aims to evade
the detection with full knowledge of the system.

thermalization of long time averaged observables is generic. The exception is a
novel mechanism for the breakdown of thermalization based on an unstable fixed

how the equilibrium values of observables encode properties of the initial

a non-canonical scaling. The Wilson action is a sum over pointwise positive
plaquette actions with a pre-factor (a^{d-4}/g^2), and gauge coupling

counter-intuitive but intelligent way, instead of heuristically trying
solutions through many hours the DRL simulation can quickly converge into a

and competition between robots in a partially observable environment, quite
similar to the Counter-Strike game. Unlike the traditional approach to games,
where the reward is given at winning the match or hitting the enemy, our DRL
algorithm rewards our robots when in a geometric-strategic advantage, which
implicitly increases the winning chances. Furthermore, we use Deep Q Learning

between two robots by avoiding the collision. Finally, we implement a variant
A* algorithm with the same implicit geometric goal as DQL and compare results.

performance gain. By dissecting the channel attention module in SENet, we
empirically show avoiding dimensionality reduction is important for learning
channel attention, and appropriate cross-channel interaction can preserve
performance while significantly decreasing model complexity. Therefore, we
propose a local cross-channel interaction strategy without dimensionality
reduction, which can be efficiently implemented via $1D$ convolution.
Furthermore, we develop a method to adaptively select kernel size of $1D$

popularity and importance of DL applications, software engineering
practitioners have some techniques specifically for them. However, little
research is conducted to identify the challenges and lacks in practice. To fill
this gap, in this paper, we surveyed 195 practitioners to understand their
insight and experience in the software engineering practice of DL applications.
Specifically, we asked the respondents to identify lacks and challenges in the
practice of the development life cycle of DL applications. The results present
13 findings that provide us with a better understanding of software engineering
practice of DL applications. Further, we distil these findings into 7
actionable recommendations for software engineering researchers and
practitioners to improve the development of DL applications.

perfect incompressible fluid, in two dimensions. The solids move according to
Newton's law, under the influence of the fluid's pressure, and the fluid
dynamics is driven by the 2D incompressible Euler equations, which are set on
the time-dependent domain corresponding to the cavity deprived of the sets
occupied by the solids. We assume that the fluid vorticity is initially bounded
and that the circulations around the solids may be non-zero. The existence of a
unique corresponding solution, \`a la Yudovich, to this system, up to a
possible collision, is known. In this paper we identify the limit dynamics of
the system when the radius of some of the solids converge to zero depending on
how, for each body, the inertia is scaled with the radius. We obtain in the
limit some point vortex systems for the solids converging to particles and a
form of Newton's law for the solids that have a fixed radius; for the fluid we
obtain an Euler-type system. This extends earlier works to the case of several
moving rigid bodies. A crucial point is to understand the interaction, through
the fluid, between small moving solids, and for that we use some normal forms
of the ODEs driving the motion of the solids in two steps: first we use a
normal form for the system coupling the time-evolution of all the solids to
obtain a rough estimate of the acceleration of the bodies, then we turn to some
normal forms that are specific to each small solid, with an appropriate
modulation related to the influence of the other solids and of the fluid
vorticity, to obtain some precise uniform a priori estimates of the velocities

commonly expected to be accompanied by an absorption signature at radio
frequencies. This feature arises as Lyman-$\alpha$ photons emitted by these
first luminous objects couple the 21 cm excitation temperature of intergalactic
hydrogen gas to its kinetic temperature, driving it into absorption relative to
the CMB. The detailed properties of this absorption profile encode powerful
information about the physics of Cosmic Dawn. Recently, Bowman et al. analysed
data from the EDGES low-band radio antenna and found an unexpectedly deep
absorption profile centred at 78 MHz, which could be a detection of this
signature. Their specific analysis fit their measurements using a polynomial
foreground model, a flattened Gaussian absorption profile and a white noise
model; we argue that a more accurate model, that includes a detailed noise
model and accounting for the effects of plausible calibration errors, is
essential for describing the EDGES data set. We perform a Bayesian
evidence-based comparison of models of the EDGES low-band data set and find
that those incorporating these additional components are decisively preferred.
The subset of the best fitting models of the data that include a global signal
favour an amplitude consistent with standard cosmological assumptions (A < 209
mK). However, there is not strong evidence to favour models of the data
including a global 21 cm signal over those without one. Ultimately, we find
that the derivation of robust constraints on astrophysics from the data is
limited by the presence of systematics.

it is difficult for a generic FCN to discriminate pixels around the object

boundaries. Meanwhile, level set based active contours are superior to the
boundary estimation due to the sub-pixel accuracy that they achieve. However,
they are quite sensitive to initial settings. To address these limitations, in
this paper we propose a novel Deep Multiphase Level Set (DMLS) method for
semantic scene parsing, which efficiently incorporates multiphase level sets
into deep neural networks. The proposed method consists of three modules, i.e.,
recurrent FCNs, adaptive multiphase level set, and deeply supervised learning.
More specifically, recurrent FCNs learn multi-level representations of input
images with different contexts. Adaptive multiphase level set drives the
discriminative contour for each semantic class, which makes use of the
advantages of both global and local information. In each time-step of the
recurrent FCNs, deeply supervised learning is incorporated for model training.
Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks have shown that our proposed
method achieves new state-of-the-art performances.

in detail and presents performance of the Micromegas detectors built with the
TBM. The effectiveness of this method was investigated by testing Micromegas

these criteria, and admits a tractable cross-entropy bound that can be
optimized directly with Monte Carlo and stochastic gradient descent. We
contrast MIM learning with maximum likelihood and VAEs. Experiments show that

  Encoder-based Approach","Submitted to ICLR 2020",,,,"cs.LG cs.CL stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traditional sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models and other variations of the
attention-mechanism such as hierarchical attention have been applied to the
text summarization problem. Though there is a hierarchy in the way humans use
language by forming paragraphs from sentences and sentences from words,
hierarchical models have usually not worked that much better than their
traditional seq2seq counterparts. This effect is mainly because either the
hierarchical attention mechanisms are too sparse using hard attention or noisy
using soft attention. In this paper, we propose a method based on extracting
the highlights of a document; a key concept that is conveyed in a few
sentences. In a typical text summarization dataset consisting of documents that
are 800 tokens in length (average), capturing long-term dependencies is very
important, e.g., the last sentence can be grouped with the first sentence of a
document to form a summary. LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) proved useful for
machine translation. However, they often fail to capture long-term dependencies
while modeling long sequences. To address these issues, we have adapted Neural
Semantic Encoders (NSE) to text summarization, a class of memory-augmented
neural networks by improving its functionalities and proposed a novel
hierarchical NSE that outperforms similar previous models significantly. The
quality of summarization was improved by augmenting linguistic factors, namely
lemma, and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags, to each word in the dataset for improved
vocabulary coverage and generalization. The hierarchical NSE model on factored
dataset outperformed the state-of-the-art by nearly 4 ROUGE points. We further
designed and used the first GPU-based self-critical Reinforcement Learning
model.

devising via machine learning such as particle-swarm optimization and

well imprecision scaling. We have thus devised an AFQM for 207-partite system.
The imprecision scaling would persist steadily for N > 207 when the parameter

overcoming a large demagnetization field. In this work, we experimentally
demonstrate for the first time, a stochastic device with perpendicular magnetic

stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (sLLG) simulations to confirm our

lung nodule surface, is a fundamental component of computational nodule
analysis pipelines. We propose a new method for segmentation that is a machine
learning based extension of current approaches, using labeled image examples to
improve its accuracy.
  Approach: We introduce an extension of the standard level set image
segmentation method where the velocity function is learned from data via
machine learning regression methods, rather than a priori designed. Instead,
the method employs a set of features to learn a velocity function that guides
the level set evolution from initialization.
  Results: We apply the method to image volumes of lung nodules from CT scans
in the publicly available LIDC dataset, obtaining an average intersection over
union score of 0.7185($\pm$0.1114), which is competitive with other methods. We
analyze segmentation performance by anatomical and appearance-based categories
of the nodules, finding that the method performs better for isolated nodules
with well-defined margins. We find that the segmentation performance for
nodules in more complex surroundings and having more complex CT appearance is
improved with the addition of combined global-local features.
  Conclusions: The level set machine learning segmentation approach proposed
herein is competitive with current methods. It provides accurate lung nodule
segmentation results in a variety of anatomical contexts.

suggestive of the potential application of neural networks in learning
nonlinear operators from data. However, the theorem guarantees only a small
approximation error for a sufficient large network, and does not consider the
important optimization and generalization errors. To realize this theorem in
practice, we propose deep operator networks (DeepONets) to learn operators
accurately and efficiently from a relatively small dataset. A DeepONet consists
of two sub-networks, one for encoding the input function at a fixed number of
sensors $x_i, i=1,\dots,m$ (branch net), and another for encoding the locations
for the output functions (trunk net). We perform systematic simulations for
identifying two types of operators, i.e., dynamic systems and partial
differential equations, and demonstrate that DeepONet significantly reduces the
generalization error compared to the fully-connected networks. We also derive
theoretically the dependence of the approximation error in terms of the number
of sensors (where the input function is defined) as well as the input function
type, and we verify the theorem with computational results. More importantly,
we observe high-order error convergence in our computational tests, namely
polynomial rates (from half order to fourth order) and even exponential

degenerate states (i.e., e$_g$-orbital and diamond-sublattice degeneracies). We
demonstrate materials realization of this model in the well-known spinel
compounds (AB$_2$X$_4$), where the tetrahedron-site cations (A) form the
diamond sub-lattice. An ideal half metal with one metallic spin channel formed
by well-isolated and half-filled e$_g$-diamond bands, accompanied by a large
spin gap (4.36 eV) is discovered in one 4-2 spinel compound (VMg$_2$O$_4$),
which becomes a magnetic Weyl semimetal when spin-orbit coupling effect is
further considered. Our discovery greatly enriches the physics of diamond
structure and spinel compounds, opening a door to their application in
spintronics.

invested in reducing the sizes. The sparsification of an over-complete model
addresses these problems as it removes redundant components and connections. In
this study, we propose a fully differentiable sparsification method for deep

directly applicable to various modern deep neural networks and imposes minimum

Of particular interest to bettors and betting companies alike is potential use

compiled, cleaned, and used the largest database of tennis match information to
date to predict match outcome using fairly simple machine learning methods.
Using such methods allows for rapid fit and prediction times to readily
incorporate new data and make real-time predictions. We were able to predict
match outcomes with upwards of 80% accuracy, much greater than predictions
using betting odds alone, and identify serve strength as a key predictor of
match outcome. By combining prediction accuracies from three models, we were
able to nearly recreate a probability distribution based on average betting

the composition of the interstellar dust grains in these high-redshift GRB host
galaxies. The majority of our sample (87%) show featureless extinction curves
and only vary in shape. We observe strong correlations (with >96% significance)
between the total-to-selective extinction, R_V, and the dust-phase column
densities of Si and Fe. Since a large fraction of interstellar iron is locked
in silicate grains, this indicates that high Si and Fe depletion leads to an
increase in the fraction of large silicate grains and vice versa. This suggests
that silicates play a vital role to induce the entire extinction at any
wavelength. On the other hand, the far-UV extinction is usually attributed to
the presence of small silicates. However, we find no trend between the far-UV
parameter of the extinction curve, c_4, and the abundance of Si and Fe in the
dust phase. We, therefore, propose that the far-UV extinction could be a
combined effect of small (probably nanoparticles) dust grains from various
species.

homogeneous spin-1/2 chain model with a FM nearest-neighbor (NN), an
antiferromagnetic (AFM) next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) inchain, and two diagonal
AFM interchain couplings (ICs) analyzed within linear spin-wave theory (LSWT)
reproduces well the observed strong dispersion along the chains and a weak one
perpendicularly. The ratio R=|J_{a2}/J_{a1}| of the FM NN and the AFM NNN
couplings is found as ~0.23, close to the critical point Rc=1/4 which separates
ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically correlated spiral magnetic ground
states in single chains, whereas Rc>0.25 for coupled chains is considerably
upshifted even for relatively weak IC. Although the measured dispersion can be
described by homogeneous LSWT, the scattering intensity appears to be
considerably reduced at ~11.5 and ~28 meV. The gap-like feature at 11.5 meV is
attributed to magnon-phonon coupling whereas based on DMRG simulations of the
dynamical structure factor the gap at 28 meV is considered to stem partly from
quantum effects due to the AFM IC. Another contribution is ascribed to the
intrinsic superstructure from the distorting incommensurate pattern of CaY
cationic chains adjacent to the CuO2 ones. It gives rise to non-equivalent CuO4
units and Cu-O-Cu bond angles Phi and a resulting distribution of all exchange
integrals. The J's fitted by homogeneous LSWT are regarded as average values.
The record value of the FM NN integral J1=24 meV among FFESC cuprates can be
explained by a non-universal Phi (not 90 deg.) and Cu-O bond length dependent
anisotropic mean direct FM Cu-O exchange K_{pd}~120 meV. Enhanced K_{pd} values
are also needed to compensate a significant AFM J_{dd} > ~6 meV.

from lambda calculus that gives meaning to open terms. As the meaning of open
terms is a key difficulty in the study of metaprogramming, we investigate
whether this idea can be extended to metaprogramming systems with hygienic and
unhygienic substitution, specifically $\lambda_{e}^{\rightarrow \Box}$ and
$\lambda_{\mathcal{S}}$. We conclude that there is quantitative evidence to
support the claim that metaprogramming with unhygienic substitution is more

basically the same for 300 years but is now challenged by the increasing volume
of articles that makes it very hard for scientists to stay up to date in their
respective fields. In fact, many have pointed out serious flaws of current
scientific publishing practices, including the lack of accuracy and efficiency
of the reviewing process. To address some of these problems, we apply here the
general principles of the Web and the Semantic Web to scientific publishing,
focusing on the reviewing process. We want to determine if a fine-grained model
of the scientific publishing workflow can help us make the reviewing processes
better organized and more accurate, by ensuring that review comments are
created with formal links and semantics from the start. Our contributions
include a novel model called Linkflows that allows for such detailed and
semantically rich representations of reviews and the reviewing processes. We
evaluate our approach on a manually curated dataset from several recent
Computer Science journals and conferences that come with open peer reviews. We
gathered ground-truth data by contacting the original reviewers and asking them
to categorize their own review comments according to our model. Comparing this
ground truth to answers provided by model experts, peers, and automated
techniques confirms that our approach of formally capturing the reviewers'
intentions from the start prevents substantial discrepancies compared to when
this information is later extracted from the plain-text comments. In general,
our analysis shows that our model is well understood and easy to apply, and it
revealed the semantic properties of such review comments.

live in cities, it is critical that we improve our understanding of the
strengths and limitations of existing city designs to ensure they are safe,
clean, can deliver health co-benefits and importantly, are sustainable into the
future. To enable this, a systematic and efficient means of performing inter-
and intra-city comparisons based on urban form is required. Until now, methods
for comparing cities have been limited by scalability, often reliant upon
non-standardised local input data that can be costly and difficult to obtain.
To address this, we have developed a unique approach to determine the mix,
distribution, and composition of neighbourhood types in cities based on
dimensions of block size and regularity, sorted by a self-organising map. We
illustrate the utility of the method to provide an understanding of the
underlying city morphology by overlaying spatially standardised city metrics
such as air pollution and transport activity across a set of 1667 global cities
with populations exceeding 300,000. The unique approach reports associations
between specific mixes of neighbourhood typologies and quantities of moving
vehicles (r=0.97), impervious surfaces (r=0.86), and air pollution levels
(aerosol optical depth r=0.58 and NO$_{2}$ r=0.57). What this illustrates, is
that this unique approach can identify the characteristics and neighbourhood
mixes of well-performing urban areas while also producing unique `city
fingerprints' that can be used to provide new metrics, insights, and drive
improvements in city design for the future.

impractical when scaling up to a larger set of functions in complex tasks; 2)
generalizability: rigid pre-defined module inventory makes it difficult to
generalize to unseen functions in new tasks/domains. To design a more powerful
NMN architecture for practical use, we propose Meta Module Network (MMN)
centered on a novel meta module, which can take in function recipes and morph
into diverse instance modules dynamically. The instance modules are then woven
into an execution graph for complex visual reasoning, inheriting the strong
explainability and compositionality of NMN. With such a flexible instantiation
mechanism, the parameters of instance modules are inherited from the central
meta module, retaining the same model complexity as the function set grows,
which promises better scalability. Meanwhile, as functions are encoded into the
embedding space, unseen functions can be readily represented based on its
structural similarity with previously observed ones, which ensures better
generalizability. Experiments on GQA and CLEVR datasets validate the
superiority of MMN over state-of-the-art NMN designs. Synthetic experiments on
held-out unseen functions from GQA dataset also demonstrate the strong
generalizability of MMN. Our code and model are released in Github

Existing approaches often require practitioners to specify noise rates, i.e., a

require a priori specification of the noise rates. Peer loss functions work
within the standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework. We show that,

different results for the novelty scores: the results for novelty score U are

ionized gas (e.g., metallicity, the SFR, or dust attenuation). They also
account for a significant fraction of broadband fluxes, in particular at the
highest redshifts, and therefore can strongly affect the determination of other
physical properties, such as the stellar mass, which are crucial in shaping our
understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. We investigate a sample of 51
LBGs at 3.0<z<3.8 with detected [OIII] line emissions and estimated the
physical properties of these galaxies to examine the impact of including
nebular emission data in the SED fitting. We used CIGALE to fit the rest-frame
UV-to-NIR SEDs of these galaxies and their emission line data simultaneously.
We ran CIGALE with and without the nebular model or the emission line data, and
compare the results to show the importance of including the nebular emission
line data in the SED fitting. We find that without the nebular model, the
fitting overestimates the stellar mass due to the strong [OIII] lines that are
redshifted to the Ks-band, consistent with previous results. The emission line
data are necessary to constrain the nebular model in the SED fitting. Examining
the Ks-band excess, which is mostly used to estimate the emissions of the
[OIII]+Hb lines when there is no spectral data, we find that the estimation and
observation are statistically consistent. However, the difference can reach up
to more than 1 dex in some catastrophic cases, which shows the importance of
obtaining spectroscopic measurements for these lines. We also estimate the
equivalent width of the Hb absorption and find it negligible compared to the Hb
emission. We conclude that line emission is important to constrain the nebular
models and to obtain reliable estimates of the physical properties of galaxies.
These data should be taken into account in the SED fitting.

interface into hills, simulating growth, while itself sliding and seeking new
valleys. In 1D, this overturn-slide-search dynamics of the active particle
causes it to move superdiffusively in the transverse direction while pulling
the immobile interface upwards. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we find an
emerging tent-like mean profile developing with time, despite large
fluctuations. The roughness of the interface follows scaling with the growth,
dynamic and roughness exponents, derived using simple arguments as $\beta=2/3,
z=3/2, \alpha=1/2$ respectively, implying a breakdown of the usual scaling law
$\beta = \alpha/z$, owing to very local growth of the interface. The transverse
displacement of the puller on the interface scales as $\sim t^{2/3}$ and the
probability distribution of its displacement is bimodal, with an unusual linear
cusp at the origin. Both the mean interface pattern and probability
distribution display scaling. A puller on a static 2D interface also displays
aspects of scaling in the mean profile and probability distribution. We also
show that a pusher on a fluctuating interface moves subdiffusively leading to a
separation of time scale in pusher motion and interface response.

reduce the latency down to a millisecond (ms) level while ensuring reliability
of the transmission. Since the current uplink transmission scheme requires a
complicated handshaking procedure to initiate the transmission, to meet this
stringent latency requirement is a challenge in wireless system design. In
particular, in the time division duplexing (TDD) systems, supporting the URLLC
is difficult since the mobile device has to wait until the transmit direction
is switched to the uplink. In this paper, we propose a new approach to support
a low latency access in TDD systems, called channel aware sparse transmission
(CAST). Key idea of the proposed scheme is to encode a grant signal in a form
of sparse vector. This together with the fact that the sensing mechanism
preserves the energy of the sparse vector allows us to use the compressed
sensing (CS) technique in CAST decoding. From the performance analysis and
numerical evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed CAST scheme achieves a
significant reduction in access latency over the 4G LTE-TDD and 5G NR-TDD
systems.

persistent tissue population, is studied numerically and analytically in a
particle-based model of active tissues. Mutations change the properties of
cells in various ways, including their mechanical properties. Each mutation
results in an advantage or disadvantage to grow in the competition between
different cell types. While changes in signaling processes and biochemistry
play an important role, we focus on changes in the mechanical properties by
studying the result of variation of growth force and adhesive
cross-interactions between cell types. For independent mutations of growth
force and adhesion strength, the tissue evolves towards cell types with high
growth force and low internal adhesion strength, as both increase the
homeostatic pressure. Motivated by biological evidence, we postulate a coupling
between both parameters, such that an increased growth force comes at the cost
of a higher internal adhesion strength or vice versa. This tradeoff controls
the evolution of the tissue, ranging from unidirectional evolution to very
heterogeneous and dynamic populations. The special case of two competing cell
types reveals three distinct parameter regimes: Two in which one cell type
outcompetes the other, and one in which both cell types coexist in a highly
mixed state. Interestingly, a single mutated cell alone suffices to reach the
mixed state, while a finite mutation rate affects the results only weakly.
Finally, the coupling between changes in growth force and adhesion strength
reveals a mechanical explanation for the evolution towards intra-tumor
heterogeneity, in which multiple species coexist even under a constant
evolutianary pressure.

data by learning a joint variational network that reconstructs multiple
clinical contrasts jointly.
  Methods: Data from our multi-contrast acquisition was embedded into the
variational network architecture where shared anatomical information is
exchanged by mixing the input contrasts. Complementary k-space sampling across
imaging contrasts and Bunch-Phase/Wave-Encoding were used for data acquisition
to improve the reconstruction at high accelerations. At 3T, our joint
variational network approach across T1w, T2w and T2-FLAIR-weighted brain scans
was tested for retrospective under-sampling at R=6 (2D) and R=4x4 (3D)
acceleration. Prospective acceleration was also performed for 3D data where the
combined acquisition time for whole brain coverage at 1 mm isotropic resolution
across three contrasts was less than three minutes.
  Results: Across all test datasets, our joint multi-contrast network better
preserved fine anatomical details with reduced image-blurring when compared to
the corresponding single-contrast reconstructions. Improvement in image quality
was also obtained through complementary k-space sampling and
Bunch-Phase/Wave-Encoding where the synergistic combination yielded the overall
best performance as evidenced by exemplarily slices and quantitative error
metrics.
  Conclusion: By leveraging shared anatomical structures across the jointly
reconstructed scans, our joint multi-contrast approach learnt more efficient
regularizers which helped to retain natural image appearance and avoid
over-smoothing. When synergistically combined with advanced encoding
techniques, the performance was further improved, enabling up to R=16-fold
acceleration with good image quality. This should help pave the way to very
rapid high-resolution brain exams.

electricity is more abundant for heating. Demand-side management through

interplanetary space, or near the Sun. Recent work has shown that CME-driven
shocks may produce SEPs while still below 5 solar radii. In this work we
explore SEP acceleration during the onset of CMEs and shocks even lower in the
corona, using realistic suprathermal spectra, for a selection of events. We
have calculated quiet-time, pre-event suprathermal particle spectra from 1 AU
observations, and scaled them back to the low corona to serve as seed spectra.
For each event, AIA observations and the CASHeW framework were used to model
the compressive/shock wave kinematics and its interaction with the corona. The
proton acceleration was then modeled using an analytic diffusive shock
acceleration model as the shock waves propagate between 1.05 and 1.3 solar
radii. We demonstrate the capability of low coronal shock-related EUV waves to
accelerate protons to multi-MeV energies in a matter of minutes, in the very
early stages of the associated solar eruptions. We find that strong proton
energization occurs for high values of the density jump, Alfven Mach number,
and shock speed. In future work the results of this early-stage shock
acceleration will be used to model the continued acceleration higher in the
corona.

solving nonlinear problems numerically. Most of these schemes are based on a
predictor/corrector step size methodology with the aim of steering an initial
guess to a zero of $f$ without switching between different attractors. In doing
so, one is typically able to reduce the chaotic behavior of the classical
Newton-type iteration scheme. In this note we propose a globalization
methodology for general Newton-type iteration concepts which changes into a
simplified Newton iteration as soon as the transformed residual of the
underlying function is small enough. Based on Banach's fixed-point theorem, we
show that there exists a neighborhood around a suitable iterate $x_{n}$ such
that we can steer the iterates---without any adaptive step size control but
using a simplified Newton-type iteration within this neighborhood---arbitrarily
close to an exact zero of $f$. We further exemplify the theoretical result
within a global Newton-type iteration procedure and discuss further an
algorithmic realization. Our proposed scheme will be demonstrated on a

not rely on postulates of equilibrium irreversible thermodynamics but treats
irreversible processes from the non-equilibrium point of view. Thus, each
transfer process is characterized by a characteristic velocity of perturbation
propagation in the non-equilibrium state, as well as by an intrinsic
time/length scale of the dissipative dynamics. The resulting system of
governing equations is formulated as a first-order system of hyperbolic
equations with relaxation-type irreversible terms. Via a formal asymptotic
analysis, we demonstrate that classical transport coefficients such as the
viscosity and heat conductivity are recovered in leading terms of our theory as
effective transport coefficients. Some numerical examples are presented in
order to demonstrate the viability of the approach.

scale-invariant theory of gravity with matter, which supports a conserved Weyl
current recently suggested as a natural flow of time. For scalar-metric
systems, a conformal class of Ashtekar-Barbero connection variables is
constructed, which can be quantized using spin networks. Crucially, the quantum
states become separable into the eigen states of the generator of the scale
transformation and spin-network states in the Einstein frame. The eigen values
consist of additional quantum numbers including a new type of fundamental
frequency $\omega$ and energy $E = \hbar \omega$ with respect to a new local
time $\tau$ carried by every spin-network vertex. The discretely distributed
$\tau$ values as the ""quanta of time"" correspond to a functional time related
to the integrated Weyl current in the classical theory. The Immirzi ambiguity
of loop quantum geometry is removed by scale symmetry. To probe the quantum
behaviour of the early Universe, the new formalism is applied to a
scale-invariant homogenous and isotropic cosmological model coupled to a
doublet of scalars with illustrative numerical simulations. The Einstein-frame
volume is quantized in recently improved and regularized polymer
representations with an arbitrary Immirzi parameter. The resulting unitary
evolution of the quantum state of an expanding universe has a positive energy
spectrum. A rescaling of the Immirzi parameter is equivalent to a translation
in time without changing dynamics. The big bang can be identified in the past
time limit when the expectation values of the Jordan-frame volume tend to zero.
Remarkably, the quantized big bang is not replaced by a big bounce---a
prevalent scenario in present loop quantum cosmology.

to this problem of entanglement distribution in a network of qubits can be used
to solve the problem of distributing Bell states and GHZ states in parallel,
when bottlenecks in $G$ would otherwise force such entangled states to be
distributed sequentially. In particular, we show that by reduction to classical
network coding protocols for the $k$-pairs problem or multiple multicast
problem in a fixed network $G$, one can distribute entanglement between the
transmitters and receivers with a Clifford circuit whose quantum depth is some
(typically small and easily computed) constant, which does not depend on the
size of $G$, however remote the transmitters and receivers are, or the number
of transmitters and receivers. These results also generalise straightforwardly
to qudits of any prime dimension. We demonstrate our results using a

They are connected to solar active regions and flares, coronal mass ejections
(CMEs), EUV waves, shocks, Type II and III radio emissions, and X-ray bursts.
These phenomena are major probes of the partition of energy in solar eruptions,
as well as for the organization, dynamics, and relaxation of coronal and
interplanetary magnetic fields. Many of these phenomena cause terrestrial space
weather, posing multiple hazards for humans and their technology from space to
the ground. Since particular flares, shocks, CMEs, and EUV waves produce SEP
events but others do not, since propagation effects from the low corona to 1 AU
appear important for some events but not others, and since Type II and III
radio emissions and X-ray bursts are sometimes produced by energetic particles
leaving these acceleration sites, it is necessary to study the whole system
with a multi-frequency and multi-instrument perspective that combines both
in-situ and remote observations with detailed modelling of phenomena. This
article demonstrates this comprehensive approach, and shows its necessity, by
analysing a trio of unusual and striking solar eruptions, radio and X-ray
bursts, and SEP events that occurred on 4 November 2015. These events show both
strong similarities and differences from standard events and each other,
despite having very similar interplanetary conditions and only two are sites
and CME genesis regions. They are therefore major targets for further in-depth
observational studies, and for testing both existing and new theories and
models. Based on the very limited modelling available we identify the aspects
that are and are not understood, and we discuss ideas that may lead to improved
understanding of the SEP, radio, and space-weather events.

SLT parallel corpora are indeed orders of magnitude smaller than those

instances. To cope with data paucity, in this paper we explore the
effectiveness of transfer learning in end-to-end SLT by presenting a
multilingual approach to the task. Multilingual solutions are widely studied in
MT and usually rely on ``\textit{target forcing}'', in which multilingual
parallel data are combined to train a single model by prepending to the input
sequences a language token that specifies the target language. However, when
tested in speech translation, our experiments show that MT-like \textit{target
forcing}, used as is, is not effective in discriminating among the target
languages. Thus, we propose a variant that uses target-language embeddings to
shift the input representations in different portions of the space according to
the language, so to better support the production of output in the desired
target language. Our experiments on end-to-end SLT from English into six
languages show important improvements when translating into similar languages,
especially when these are supported by scarce data. Further improvements are
obtained when using English ASR data as an additional language (up to $+2.5$
BLEU points).

extreme properties, they are considered among the most valuable laboratories to
test accretion models. Recently, the orbital parameters of a member of this
class, IGR J08408-4503, were obtained from optical observations. We used this
information, together with X-ray observations from previous publications and
new results from X-ray and optical data collected by INTEGRAL and presented in
this work, to study the accretion mechanisms at work in IGR J08408-4503. We
found that the high eccentricity of the compact object orbit and the large size
of the donor star imply Roche lobe overflow (RLO) around the periastron. It is
also likely that a fraction of the outer layers of the photosphere of the donor
star are lost from the Lagrangian point $L_2$ during the periastron passages.
On the basis of these findings, we discuss the flaring variability of IGR
J08408-4503 assuming the presence of an accretion disc. We point out that IGR
J08408-4503 may not be the only SFXT with an accretion disc fueled by RLO.
These findings open a new scenario for accretion mechanisms in SFXTs, since
most of them have so far been based on the assumption of spherically symmetric

switches to connect server racks providing large bisection bandwidth. An
effective load-balancing mechanism is required in order to fully utilize the
available capacity of the multiple paths. While packet-based load-balancing can
achieve high utilization, it suffers from reordering. Flow-based load-balancing
such as equal-cost multipath routing (ECMP) spreads traffic uniformly across
multiple paths leading to frequent hash collisions and suboptimal performance.
Finally, flowlet based load-balancing such as CONGA or HULA splits flows into
smaller units, which are sent on different paths. Most flowlet based
load-balancing schemes depend on a proper static setting of the flowlet gap,
which decides when new flowlets are detected. While a too small gap may lead to
reordering, a too large gap results in missed load-balancing opportunities. In
this paper, we propose FlowDyn, which dynamically adapts the flowlet gap to
increase the efficiency of the load-balancing schemes while avoiding the
reordering problem. Using programmable data planes, FlowDyn uses active probes
together with telemetry information to track path latency between different ToR
switches. FlowDyn calculates dynamically a suitable flowlet gap that can be
used for flowlet based load-balancing mechanism. We evaluate FlowDyn
extensively in simulation, showing that it achieves 3.19 times smaller flow

a sequence S of updates and they answer queries using the latest version of the

To handle operations that change the sequence S of updates, Demaine et al.
(TALG 2007) introduced retroactive data structures. A retroactive operation
modifies the update sequence S in a given position t, called time, and either
creates or cancels an update in S at time t. A partially retroactive data
structure restricts queries to be executed exclusively in the latest version of
the data structure. A fully retroactive data structure supports queries at any
time t: a query at time t is answered using only the updates of S up to time t.
If the sequence S only consists of insertions, the resulting data structure is
an incremental retroactive data structure. While efficient retroactive data
structures have been proposed for classic data structures, e.g., stack,
priority queue and binary search tree, the retroactive version of graph
problems are rarely studied.

states are similar to the coherent-state-based light-matter entangled states of
a previous hybrid quantum repeater, but unlike the latter our scheme avoids the
necessity of employing 2n-1 memory stations and writing the transmitted optical
states into the matter memory qubits. The full scaling advantage of this
memory-assisted phase-matching QKD (MA-PM QKD) is obtainable with threshold
detectors in a scenario with only channel loss. We mainly focus on the
obtainable secret-key rates per channel use for up to n=4 including memory
dephasing and for n=2 (i.e., $\sqrt[4]{\eta_{total}}$-MA-PM QKD assisted by a
single memory station) for error models including dark counts, memory dephasing
and depolarization, and phase mismatch. By combining the twin-field concept of
interfering phase-sensitive optical states with that of storing quantum states
up to a cutoff memory time, distances well beyond 700 km with rates well above
$\eta_{total}$ can be reached for realistic, high-quality quantum memories (up
to 1s coherence time) and modest detector efficiencies. Similarly, the standard
single-node quantum repeater, scaling as $\sqrt{\eta_{total}}$, can be beaten
when approaching perfect detectors and exceeding spin coherence times of 5s;
beating ideal twin-field QKD requires 1s. As for further experimental
simplifications, our treatment includes the notion of weak nonlinearities for
the light-matter states, a discussion on the possibility of using homodyne
detectors, and a comparison between sequential and parallel entanglement

(PPI) networks by optimization methods remains a longstanding challenge in
biology. Traditional algorithms simply consider strong protein complexes that
can be found in the original network by optimizing some metrics, which causes
obstacles for the discovery of weak and hidden complexes shielded by stronger
complexes. Also, protein complexes are not only in different density but also
in a large range of scale, making it extremely difficult to be detected. Toward
this objective, we propose a hierarchical hidden community approach to predict
protein complexes. Results: We propose a method called HirHide (Hierarchical
Hidden Community Detection), which can be combined with traditional community
detection methods to enable them to discover hierarchical hidden communities.
It is the first community detection algorithm that can find a hierarchical
structure as well as hidden structure. We compare the performance of three
traditional methods with their HirHide versions. Experimental results show that
the HirHide methods using traditional methods as the base algorithms achieve
better performance, sometimes even significantly outperform the baselines.

semiconductors that converts one spin-singlet exciton to two triplet excitons.
It offers the potential to enhance solar energy conversion by circumventing the
Shockley-Queisser limit on efficiency. Recently, the mechanism of the primary
singlet fission process in pentacene and its derivatives have been extensively
investigated, however, the nature of the primary ultrafast process in singlet
fission is still a matter of debate. Here, we study the singlet fission process
in a pentacene film by employing a combination of transient-grating (TG) and
two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy complemented by quantum chemical
and nonadiabatic dynamics calculations. The high sensitivity of heterodyne
detected TG spectroscopy enabled us to capture the vibrational coherence and to
show that it mediates the transition from the singlet excited electronic state
to the triplet-pair state. This coherent process is further examined by 2D
electronic spectroscopy. Detailed analysis of the experimental data reveals
that significant vibronic couplings of a few key modes in the low- and
high-frequency region connect the excited singlet and triplet-pair states.
Based on quantum chemical calculations, we identify these key intermolecular
rocking modes along the longitudinal molecular axis between the pentacene
molecules. They play the essential role of an electronic bridge between the
singlet and triplet-pair states. Along with high-frequency local vibrations
acting as tuning modes, these rocking motions drive the ultrafast dynamics at
the multidimensional conical intersection in the singlet fission process.

which allow us to avoid the use of standard replica techniques, while capturing
the entirety of the late ISW effect on the large scales. We post-process the
light cones using an accurate ray-tracing method and construct full-sky maps of
the ISW temperature anisotropy for three different dark energy models. We
quantify in detail the extent to which the ISW effect can be used to
discriminate between different dark energy scenarios when cross-correlated with
the matter distribution or the CMB lensing potential. We also investigate the
onset of non-linearities, the so-called Rees-Sciama effect which provides a
complementary probe of the dark sector. We find the signal of the

impact of the configuration of all the different protocol's parameters on the
end-to-end reliability, delay, and scalability. In particular, we focused on
the structure of the packet broadcast process, which takes place in time
intervals known as \textit{Advertising Events} and \textit{Scanning Events}.
Results indicate a high degree of interdependence among all the different
timing parameters involved in both the scanning and the advertising processes
and show that the correct operation of the protocol greatly depends on the
compatibility between their configurations. We also demonstrated that
introducing randomization in these timing parameters, as well as varying the
duration of the \textit{Advertising Events}, reduces the drawbacks of the
flooding propagation mechanism implemented by the protocol. Using data
collected from a real office environment, we also studied the behavior of the
protocol in the presence of WLAN interference. It was shown that Bluetooth Mesh
is vulnerable to external interference, even when implementing the standardized
limitation of using only 3 out of the 40 Bluetooth Low Energy frequency
channels. We observed that the achievable average delay is relatively low, of
around 250~ms for over 10 hops under the worst simulated network conditions.
However, results proved that scalability is especially challenging for
Bluetooth Mesh since it is prone to broadcast storm, hindering the
communication reliability for denser deployments.

therefore formulate the optimization problem from a distributional robustness

a tree-based representation of machine learning pipelines and conducts a
genetic-programming based approach to find the model and its hyperparameters

evaluate its efficacy within neuroimaging datasets, we chose a problem that has

include the information necessary to determine the age of ocean floor that has
since been lost to subduction. However, due to the lack of an automated and
efficient method for generating global seafloor age grids, many tectonic
models, most notably those extending back into the Paleozoic, are published
without an accompanying set of age models for oceanic lithosphere. Here we
present an automatic, tracer-based algorithm that generates seafloor age grids
from global plate tectonic reconstructions with defined plate boundaries. Our
method enables us to produce the first seafloor age models for the Paleozoic's
lost ocean basins. Estimated changes in sea level based on bathymetry inferred

from proxies, providing a possible explanation for the peak in sea level during
the assembly phase of Pangea. This demonstrates how our seafloor age models can
be directly compared with observables from the geologic record that extend
further back in time than the constraints from preserved seafloor. Thus, our
new algorithm may also aid the further development of plate tectonic
reconstructions by strengthening the links between geological observations and

molecular masers associated with very young high-mass stars. These measurements
strongly suggest that the Milky Way is a four-arm spiral. Fitting log-periodic
spirals to the locations of the masers, allows us to significantly expand our
view of the structure of the Milky Way. We present an updated model for its
spiral structure and incorporate it into our previously published
parallax-based distance-estimation program for sources associated with spiral
arms. Modeling the three-dimensional space motions yields estimates of the
distance to the Galactic center, Ro = 8.15 +/- 0.15 kpc, the circular rotation
speed at the Sun's position, To = 236 +/- 7 km/s, and the nature of the
rotation curve. Our data strongly constrain the full circular velocity of the
Sun, To + Vsun = 247 +/- 4 km/s, and its angular velocity, (To + Vsun)/Ro =
30.32 +/- 0.27 km/s/kpc. Transforming the measured space motions to a
Galactocentric frame which rotates with the Galaxy, we find non-circular
velocity components typically about 10 km/s. However, near the Galactic bar and
in a portion of the Perseus arm, we find significantly larger non-circular
motions. Young high-mass stars within 7 kpc of the Galactic center have a scale
height of only 19 pc and, thus, are well suited to define the Galactic plane.
We find that the orientation of the plane is consistent with the IAU-defined
plane to within +/-0.1 deg., and that the Sun is offset toward the north
Galactic pole by Zsun = 5.5 +/- 5.8 pc. Accounting for this offset places the
central supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, in the midplane of the Galaxy. Using
our improved Galactic parameters, we predict the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar to
be at a distance of 6.54 +/- 0.24 kpc, assuming its orbital decay from
gravitational radiation follows general relativity.

the trajectory optimizer speeds up the convergence. We also discuss the

problems in graph optimization, from a theoretical as well as from a practical
point of view. In this paper, we address the recently introduced (minimum)
weighted total domination problem. In this problem, we are given an undirected
graph with a vertex weight function and an edge weight function. The goal is to
find a total dominating set D in this graph with minimal weight. A total
dominating set D is a subset of the vertices such that every vertex in the
graph, including vertices in D, is adjacent to a vertex in D. The weight is
measured as the sum of all vertex weights of vertices in D, plus the edge
weights in the subgraph induced by D, plus for each vertex not in D the minimum
weight of an edge from it to a vertex in D. In this paper, we present two new
Mixed-Integer Programming models for the problem, and design solution

develop a genetic algorithm, which is based on a greedy randomized adaptive

of freedom (DoF) of the array to design a robust beamformer, especially when
the array DoF is limited. In this paper, we leverage the tool of constrained
convex optimization and propose a penalized inequality-constrained minimum
variance (P-ICMV) beamformer to address this challenge. Specifically, a
well-targeted objective function and inequality constraints are proposed to
achieve the design goals. By penalizing the maximum gain of the beamformer at
any interfering directions, the total interference power can be efficiently
mitigated with limited DoF. Multiple robust constraints on the target
protection and interference suppression can be introduced to increase the
robustness of the beamformer against steering vector mismatch. By integrating
the noise reduction, interference suppression, and target protection, the
proposed formulation can efficiently obtain a robust beamformer design while
optimally trading off various design goals. To numerically solve this problem,
we formulate the P-ICMV beamformer design as a convex second-order cone program
(SOCP) and propose a low complexity iterative algorithm based on the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Three applications are
simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed beamformer.

bandwidth problem, separation problem and maximum differential coloring
problem. Given a labeled graph (i.e., a numbering of the vertices of a graph),
the antibandwidth of a node is defined as the minimum absolute difference of
its labeling to the labeling of all its adjacent vertices. The goal in the
antibandwidth problem is to find a labeling maximizing the antibandwidth. The
problem is NP-hard in general graphs and has applications in diverse areas like
scheduling, radio frequency assignment, obnoxious facility location and
map-coloring. There has been much work on deriving theoretical bounds for the
problem and also in the design of metaheuristics in recent years. However, the
optimality gaps between the best known solution values and reported upper
bounds for the HarwellBoeing Matrix-instances, which are the commonly used
benchmark instances for this problem, are often very large (e.g., up to 577%).
The upper bounds reported in literature are based on the theoretical bounds
involving simple graph characteristics, i.e., size, order and degree, and a
mixed-integer programming (MIP) model. We present new MIP models for the
problem, together with valid inequalities, and design a branch-and-cut
algorithm and an iterative solution algorithm based on them. These algorithms
also include two starting heuristics and a primal heuristic. We also present a
constraint programming approach, and calculate upper bounds based on the
stability number and chromatic number. Our computational study shows that the
developed approaches allow to find the proven optimal solution for eight
instances from literature, where the optimal solution was unknown and also
provide reduced gaps for eleven additional instances, including improved
solution values for seven instances, the largest optimality gap is now 46%.

informed decisions about whether to conduct and how to design future studies.
Historically, a computationally expensive method to compute the Expected Value
of Sample Information (EVSI) restricted the use of VOI to simple decision
models and study designs. Recently, four EVSI approximation methods have made
such analyses more feasible and accessible. We provide practical
recommendations for analysts computing EVSI by evaluating these novel methods.
Methods: Members of the Collaborative Network for Value of Information (ConVOI)
compared the inputs, analyst's expertise and skills, and software required for
four recently developed approximation methods. Information was also collected
on the strengths and limitations of each approximation method. Results: All
four EVSI methods require a decision-analytic model's probabilistic sensitivity
analysis (PSA) output. One of the methods also requires the model to be re-run
to obtain new PSA outputs for each EVSI estimation. To compute EVSI, analysts
must be familiar with at least one of the following skills: advanced regression
modeling, likelihood specification, and Bayesian modeling. All methods have
different strengths and limitations, e.g., some methods handle evaluation of
study designs with more outcomes more efficiently while others quantify
uncertainty in EVSI estimates. All methods are programmed in the statistical
language R and two of the methods provide online applications. Conclusion: Our
paper helps to inform the choice between four efficient EVSI estimation
methods, enabling analysts to assess the methods' strengths and limitations and
select the most appropriate EVSI method given their situation and skills.

alterations are reflected by some of the popular sentence embedding models. We
found that vector differences of some embeddings actually reflect small changes

tested using datasets of isolated small molecules, crystalline materials,
liquid water and an aqueous alkaline electrolyte. PiNN comes with a visualizer

minimize the social cost, inclusive of infection and economic costs, of the
spread of an epidemic disease. The disease lowers economic production and thus
income by reducing the size of the labor force employed in productive
activities, tightening thus the economy's overall resources constraint. We
consider a framework in which the planner uses the collected tax revenue to
intervene in either prevention (aimed at reducing the rate of infection) or
treatment (aimed at increasing the speed of recovery). Both optimal prevention
and treatment policies allow the economy to achieve a disease-free equilibrium
in the long run but their associated costs are substantially different along
the transitional dynamic path. By quantifying the social costs associated with
prevention and treatment we determine which policy is most cost-effective under
different circumstances, showing that prevention (treatment) is desirable
whenever the infectivity rate is low (high).

of the voltages with respect to reactive power, which can be obtained from
data. As we show, an approximation of these sensitivities is also sufficient,
which makes the approach essentially model-free, easy to tune, compatible with
the current sensing and control infrastructure, and remarkably robust to

high thermal efficiency is mainly constrained by knock and super-knock
respectively due to the end gas autoignition and detonation development. At the
end of the compression stroke, the pressure wave propagation and reflection in
a small confined space may greatly influence the end gas autoignition, leading
to different autoignition characteristics from those in a large or open space.
The present study investigates the transient autoignition process in an
iso-octane/air mixture inside a closed chamber under engine-relevant
conditions. The emphasis is given to the assessing effects of the pressure
wave-wall reflection and the mechanism of extremely strong pressure
oscillations typical for super-knock. It is found that the hot spot induced
autoignition in a closed chamber can be greatly affected by shock/pressure wave
reflection from the end wall. Different autoignition modes respectively from
the hot spot and end wall reflection are identified. A non-dimensional
parameter quantifying the interplay between different length and time scales is
introduced, which helps to identify different autoignition regimes including
detonation development near the end wall. It is shown that detonation
development from the hot spot may cause super-knock with devastating pressure
oscillation. However, the detonation development from the end wall can hardly
produce pressure oscillation strong enough for the super-knock. The obtained
results provide a fundamental insight into the knocking mechanism in engines
under highly boosted conditions.

method. Methods. We obtained the first interferometric observations for the
eclipsing systems AI Phe, AL Dor, KW Hya, NN Del, $\psi$ Cen and V4090 Sgr with
the VLTI/PIONIER combiner, which we combined with radial velocity measurements
to derive their three-dimensional orbit, masses, and distance. Results. We
determined very precise stellar masses for all systems, ranging from 0.04% to
3.3 % precision level. We combined these measurements with stellar effective
temperature and linear radius to fit stellar isochrones models and determined
the age of the systems. We also derived the distance to the systems with a
precision level as high as 0.4%. Conclusions. The comparison of theoretical
models with stellar parameters shows that stellar models are still deficient in
simultaneously fitting the stellar parameters (Teff , R and M) with such level
of precision on individual masses. This stresses the importance of precisely
measuring the stellar parameters to better calibrate stellar evolution models.
The precision of our model-independent orbital parallaxes varies from 24$\mu$as
as to 70$\mu$as and they provide a unique opportunity to check on the future
Gaia measurements for possible systematic errors.

unsolved problem. A notable result towards solving this problem was established
by Galvin and J\'onsson when they classified (up to lattice isomorphism) all of
the distributive sublattices of free lattices in 1959. In this paper, we weaken
the requirement that of a free lattice be distributive to requiring that such a
lattice belongs in the variety of lattices generated by the pentagon N5.
Specifically, we use McKenzie's list of join-irreducible covers of the variety
generated by N5 to extend Galvin and J\'onsson's results by proving that all
sublattices of a free lattice that belong to the variety generated by N5
satisfy three structural properties. Afterwards, we explain how the results in
this paper can be partially extended to lattices from seven known infinite
sequences of semidistributive lattice varieties.

prevalent, yet there are only a limited number of software tools available for
approximating their solution due to the complexity of the problem. This paper
represents a step forward in the special case where both the state equation and
the control costs are quadratic. As it represents the natural extension of the
linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) problem, we describe this setting as the
quadratic-quadratic regulator (QQR) problem. This is significantly more
challenging and holds the LQR as special case that must be solved along the
way. We describe an algorithm that exploits the structure of the QQR problem
that arises when implementing Al'Brekht's method. This approach is amenable to
feedback laws with low degree polynomials but have a relatively modest model
dimension that could be achieved by modern model reduction methods. This
problem has an elegant formulation and a solution that introduces several
linear systems where the structure suggests modern tensor-based linear solvers.
We demonstrate this algorithm on a suite of random test problems then apply it
to a distributed parameter control problem that fits the QQR framework.
Comparisons to linear feedback control laws show a modest benefit using the QQR
formulation.

II) from the Carnegie Supernova Project-II (CSP-II), the largest such dataset

evolution over time. The NIR spectroscopic properties of SNe II fall into two
distinct groups. This classification is first based on the strength of the He I
$\lambda1.083\,\mu$m absorption during the plateau phase; SNe II are either
significantly above (spectroscopically strong) or below $50$ angstroms
(spectroscopically weak) in pseudo equivalent width. However between the two
groups, other properties, such as the timing of CO formation and the presence
of Sr II, are also observed. Most surprisingly, the distinct weak and strong
NIR spectroscopic classes correspond to SNe II with slow and fast declining
light curves, respectively. These two photometric groups match the modern
nomenclature of SNe IIP and IIL. Including NIR spectra previously published, 18
out of 19 SNe II follow this slow declining-spectroscopically weak and fast
declining-spectroscopically strong correspondence. This is in apparent
contradiction to the recent findings in the optical that slow and fast
decliners show a continuous distribution of properties. The weak SNe II show a
high-velocity component of helium that may be caused by a thermal excitation
from a reverse-shock created by the outer ejecta interacting with the red
supergiant wind, but the origin of the observed dichotomy is not understood.
Further studies are crucial in determining whether the apparent differences in
the NIR are due to distinct physical processes or a gap in the current data
set.

for inferring scene parameter updates from the rasterized 2D scene. However,
the rasterization process is notoriously difficult to invert, both due to the
projection and occlusion process, but also due to secondary effects such as
lighting or reflections. We propose to remove the latter from the process by
mapping the rasterized image into an abstract feature space learned in a
self-supervised way from pixel correspondences. Using only a light-weight
inverse rendering module, this allows us to refine 6D object pose estimations
in highly cluttered scenes by optimizing a simple pixel-wise difference in the

HCG 16 using the multi-scale CLEAN algorithm to accurately recover diffuse
features. Despite the clear disruption of the HI component of HCG 16 we find
that it is not globally HI deficient, even though HCG 16a and b have lost the
majority of their HI and almost 50% of the group's HI is in the IGrM, including
a 160 kpc long tail extending towards the SE. This study indicates that in the
recent past (~1 Gyr) galaxies HCG 16a and b likely underwent major interactions
that unbound gas without triggering significant star formation. This gas was
then swept away by a high speed, close encounter with NGC 848. The starburst
events HCG 16c and d have triggered galactic winds which, in the case of HCG
16d, appears to have disrupted its HI reservoir. The tidal features still
connected to these galaxies indicate that more HI will soon be lost to the
IGrM, while that which remains in the discs will likely be consumed by star
formation episodes. This is expected to result in a collection of gas-poor
galaxies embedded in a diffuse HI structure, which will gradually be evaporated
by the UV background, resembling the final stage of the evolutionary model of
compact groups. This work is accompanied by a complete workflow to reproduce
the final data products, intended to improve reproducibility. (Abridged)

  networks with shared inputs: A case of China's Five-Year Plans","26 pages, Data envelopment analysis",,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Attaining the optimal scale size of production systems is an issue frequently
found in the priority questions on management agendas of various types of
organizations. Determining the most productive scale size (MPSS) allows the
decision makers not only to know the best scale size that their systems can
achieve but also to tell the decision makers how to move the inefficient
systems onto the MPSS region. This paper investigates the MPSS concept for
production systems consisting of multiple subsystems connected in parallel.
First, we propose a relational model where the MPSS of the whole system and the
internal subsystems are measured in a single DEA implementation. Then, it is
proved that the MPSS of the system can be decomposed as the weighted sum of the
MPSS of the individual subsystems. The main result is that the system is
overall MPSS if and only if it is MPSS in each subsystem. MPSS decomposition
allows the decision makers to target the non-MPSS subsystems so that the
necessary improvements can be readily suggested. An application of China's
Five-Year Plans (FYPs) with shared inputs is used to show the applicability of
the proposed model for estimating and decomposing MPSS in parallel network DEA.
Industry and Agriculture sectors are selected as two parallel subsystems in the
FYPs. Interesting findings have been noticed. Using the same amount of
resources, the Industry sector had a better economic scale than the Agriculture
sector. Furthermore, the last two FYPs, 11th and 12th, were the perfect two
FYPs among the others.

shortened the development life-cycle limiting resources spent on security
analysis of software designs. In this context, architecture models are (often
manually) analyzed for potential security threats. Risk-last threat analysis
suggests identifying all security threats before prioritizing them. In
contrast, risk-first threat analysis suggests identifying the risks before the
threats, by-passing threat prioritization. This seems promising for
organizations where developing speed is of great importance. Yet, little
empirical evidence exists about the effect of sacrificing systematicity for
high-priority threats on the performance and execution of threat analysis. To
this aim, we conduct a case study with industrial experts from the automotive
domain, where we empirically compare a risk-first technique to a risk-last
technique. In this study, we consciously trade the amount of participants for a
more realistic simulation of threat analysis sessions in practice. This allows
us to closely observe industrial experts and gain deep insights into the
industrial practice. This work contributes with: (i) a quantitative comparison
of performance, (ii) a quantitative and qualitative comparison of execution,
and (iii) a comparative discussion of the two techniques. We find no
differences in the productivity and timeliness of discovering high-priority
security threats. Yet, we find differences in analysis execution. In
particular, participants using the risk-first technique found twice as many
high-priority threats, developed detailed attack scenarios, and discussed
threat feasibility in detail. On the other hand, participants using the
risk-last technique found more medium and low-priority threats and finished
early.

They are classified into groups according to their translational, rotational,
and inversion symmetries. In computational analysis of Bravais lattices,
fulfilment of symmetry conditions is usually determined by analysis of the
metric tensor, using either a numerical tolerance to produce a binary (i.e. yes
or no) classification, or a distance function which quantifies the deviation
from an ideal lattice type. The metric tensor, though, is not scale-invariant,
which complicates the choice of threshold and the interpretation of the
distance function. Here, we quantify the distance of a lattice from a target
Bravais class using strain. For an arbitrary lattice, we find the
minimum-strain transformation needed to fulfil the symmetry conditions of a
desired Bravais lattice type; the norm of the strain tensor is used to quantify
the degree of symmetry breaking. The resulting distance is invariant to scale
and rotation, and is a physically intuitive quantity. By symmetrizing to all
Bravais classes, each lattice can be placed in a 14 dimensional space, which we
use to create a map of the space of Bravais lattices and the transformation
paths between them. A software implementation is available online under a

this question for the class of {\em split graphs}, that we observe to be the
hardest instances for deciding whether the diameter is at most two. We stress
that although the diameter of a non-complete split graph can only be either $2$
or $3$, under the Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH) we cannot compute
the diameter of an $n$-vertex $m$-edge split graph in less than quadratic time
-- in the size $n+m$ of the input. Therefore it is worth to study the
complexity of diameter computation on {\em subclasses} of split graphs, in
order to better understand the complexity border. Specifically, we consider the
split graphs with bounded {\em clique-interval number} and their complements,
with the former being a natural variation of the concept of interval number for
split graphs that we introduce in this paper. We first discuss the relations
between the clique-interval number and other graph invariants such as the
classic interval number of graphs, the treewidth, the {\em VC-dimension} and
the {\em stabbing number} of a related hypergraph. Then, in part based on these
above relations, we almost completely settle the complexity of diameter
computation on these subclasses of split graphs: - For the $k$-clique-interval
split graphs, we can compute their diameter in truly subquadratic time if
$k={\cal O}(1)$, and even in quasi linear time if $k=o(\log{n})$ and in
addition a corresponding ordering of the vertices in the clique is given.
However, under SETH this cannot be done in truly subquadratic time for any $k =
\omega(\log{n})$. - For the {\em complements} of $k$-clique-interval split
graphs, we can compute their diameter in truly subquadratic time if $k={\cal
O}(1)$, and even in time ${\cal O}(km)$ if a corresponding ordering of the
vertices in the stable set is given. Again this latter result is optimal under
SETH up to polylogarithmic factors. Our findings raise the question whether a

understanding transport, but checking its validity with molecular dynamics is

scheme for detecting hydrodynamic modes that takes into account the role of
pressure fluctuations. We show that the predictions given by NFHD on the
relaxation processes of hydrodynamic modes are valid only when the pressure of
the system is zero and the pressure fluctuations are weak. For nonvanishing
pressure, two other regimes arise as the hydrodynamic modes can respond to
small and large pressure fluctuations and relax in two additionally distinct

suggest that there are at least three universality classes of transport in
anharmonic chains.

discretization for the drift-kinetic Vlasov-Maxwell system, utilizing
finite-elements for the electromagnetic fields and the particle-in-cell
approach for the Vlasov distribution. The proposed scheme is fully
electromagnetic, dealing with fields instead of potentials, and includes the
effects of polarization and magnetization in the Gauss and Amp\`ere-Maxwell
laws, a consequence of reducing the full particle dynamics to drift-center
dynamics. There is, however, no need to invert the Gauss law: it is satisfied
automatically at every time-step as a result of a discrete Noether symmetry,
and the electric field is updated directly from the Amp\`ere-Maxwell equation.
The method provides an update for the magnetic field that is fully explicit,
involving only local operations. The update for particles is implicit for each
particle individually, also leading to local operations only. The update for
the electric field is linearly implicit due to the presence of a finite-element
mass matrix and polarization and magnetization effects in the Amp\`ere-Maxwell
equation, hence involving a sparse matrix inversion once at every time step.
Because the scheme deals with the electromagnetic fields and not the
potentials, it also provides the first serious attempt at constructing a
structure-preserving numerical scheme for the mixed
kinetic-ion--drift-kinetic-electron Vlasov-Maxwell model. Consequently, the
proposed method could be used to simulate electromagnetic turbulence in fusion
experiments or space plasmas that exhibit a strong background magnetic field
while retaining all of the ion physics, most of the necessary electron physics,
yet eliminating perhaps the biggest obstacle in reaching macroscopic transport
time scales in kinetic simulations, namely the electron cyclotron time scale.

that the stellar masses of the observed clumps are overestimated by as much as

overestimated by factor of several, due to a combination of spatial resolution
and projection. The masses of young stars contributing most of the UV emission

$\sim$150 Myr. Some clumps with dense cores can last longer but eventually
disperse. Most of the clumps are not bound structures, with virial parameter

similar (but not necessarily identical) effects on survival across different

allowed to vary by cancer type while the mean effect of each gene was shared
across cancers. Within this framework we considered four parametric survival
models (normal, log-normal, exponential, and Weibull), and we compared their
performance via a cross-validation approach in which we fit each model on
training data and estimate the log-posterior predictive likelihood on test
data. The log-normal model gave the best fit, and we investigated the partial
effect of each gene on survival via a forward selection procedure. Through this
we determined that mutations at TP53 and FAT4 were together the most useful for
predicting patient survival. We validated the model via simulation to ensure

different in a shallow lagoon with a few meters deep seafloor that can be

local benthic communities. To study the physical processes associated with the
daily cycle of south-Pacific lagoon Bora Bora, a vertical string of five
high-resolution temperature sensors was moored at a 2-m deep site for 3 weeks.
Besides the standard ocean warming (approximately during daytime) and cooling
(approximately nighttime), the sensors show relatively highest temperature near
the lagoon-floor during the warming phase and a weakly stable stratification
towards the end of the cooling phase. During the warming phase, highly variable
stratification is observed extending into the water column under calm weather
and turbid waters, otherwise not. Under trade wind and clear waters, the lowest
sensor(s) show(s) consistently higher temperature variability than sensors
higher-up with spectral slopes indicative of shear- and/or convective
turbulence. During the cooling phase, the lower sensor shows consistently very
low variance (non-turbulent), while other sensors show a spectral slope around
the buoyancy frequency evidencing weakly stratified waters supporting internal
waves. These observations contrast with open-ocean near-surface observations of
stable stratification during the warming phase and of turbulent free convection
during the cooling phase. Thus, lagoons seem to more resemble the atmosphere
than the ocean in daytime thermodynamics and possibly act as a natural solar
pond with bottom conductive heating (when salinity compensates for unstable
temperature variations).

associated with the topography and the occupation history, are part of the

from forest to pasture in the commercial farming area most often associated
soils are sandy. This raises the following hypothesis: the deforestation that
occurred in the period are related to livestock activities. Livestock favors
access to water and low fertility sands does not affect production. On the
other hand, the soybean expansion occurred preferentially on existing pastures
and on clay soils (Belterra clay), reducing the availability of pastures on
these soils. The relative importance of types of soil increases with time. In
the area of settlements, the transition from forest to pasture and family crops
occurred preferentially on the variegated clay. However, it is possible that
the prevalence of this transition on this texture has been given due more to
the history of occupation of this area. Historically the sandy valleys were the
first to be occupied, and the continuity of the deforestation occurred toward
the slopes dominated by variegated clay and plateaus with Belterra clay. These
associations observed indicate that, within a wider context of social, economic
and political factors, natural variable factors in space are important for the
choice of managements in the properties, but they are done differently in the
territory, and the best knowledge of these relationships are useful for
territorial planning.

discovered by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory in 2016 within $r\sim1$ pc of
Sgr A*. NuSTAR detected bright X-ray outbursts from T15 and T37, likely in the
soft and hard states, with 3-79~keV luminosities of $8\times10^{36}$ and
$3\times10^{37}$ erg/s, respectively. No X-ray outbursts have previously been
detected from the two transients and our Chandra ACIS analysis puts an upper
limit of $L_X \lesssim 2 \times10^{31}$ erg/s on their quiescent 2-8 keV
luminosities. No pulsations, significant QPOs, or type I X-ray bursts were
detected in the NuSTAR data. While T15 exhibited no significant red noise, the
T37 power density spectra are well characterized by three Lorentzian
components. The declining variability of T37 above $\nu \sim 10$ Hz is typical
of black hole (BH) transients in the hard state. NuSTAR spectra of both
transients exhibit a thermal disk blackbody, X-ray reflection with broadened Fe
atomic features, and a continuum component well described by Comptonization
models. Their X-ray reflection spectra are most consistent with high BH spin
($a_{*} \gtrsim 0.9$) and large disk density ($n_e\sim10^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$).
Based on the best-fit ionization parameters and disk densities, we found that
X-ray reflection occurred near the inner disk radius, which was derived from
the relativistic broadening and thermal disk component. These X-ray
characteristics suggest the outbursting BH-LMXB scenario for both transients
and yield the first BH spin measurements from X-ray transients in the central
100 pc region.

We define interesting in this way: The ""harder to learn"" relation is reversed

understand problems by formulating rules, ML using neural networks does not
rely on constructing rules. We discuss a novel approach where the challenge is

With these tasks, both the AI and HI will be studied with rigor and precision.
The immediate goal is to find interesting groundtruth rule pairs. In the long
term, the goal will be to understand, in a generalizable way, what

importance not only to provide accurate predictions, but also to ensure certain

providing models that are robust to worst-case perturbations around predefined
points. Unfortunately, one of the main issues in adversarial training is that
robustness w.r.t. gradient-based attackers is always achieved at the cost of
prediction accuracy. In this paper, a new algorithm, called Wasserstein
Projected Gradient Descent (WPGD), for adversarial training is proposed. WPGD
provides a simple way to obtain cost-sensitive robustness, resulting in a finer
control of the robustness-accuracy trade-off. Moreover, WPGD solves an optimal
transport problem on the output space of the network and it can efficiently
discover directions where robustness is required, allowing to control the
directional trade-off between accuracy and robustness. The proposed WPGD is
validated in this work on image recognition tasks with different benchmark
datasets and architectures. Moreover, real world-like datasets are often
unbalanced: this paper shows that when dealing with such type of datasets, the
performance of adversarial training are mainly affected in term of standard
accuracy.

mathematical structure which makes their DS properties partly analytically

harbor widely differing time scales, and show that our method is also en par

of such networks involves carefully trading off entropy of the latent

depends on the observer of the images which, in the vast majority of
literature, is assumed to be human. In this paper, we aim to go beyond this
notion of compression quality and look at human visual perception and image
classification simultaneously. To that end, we use a family of loss functions
that allows to optimize deep image compression depending on the observer and to
interpolate between human perceived visual quality and classification accuracy,
enabling a more unified view on image compression. Our extensive experiments
show that using perceptual loss functions to train a compression system
preserves classification accuracy much better than traditional codecs such as
BPG without requiring retraining of classifiers on compressed images. For
example, compressing ImageNet to 0.25 bpp reduces Inception-ResNet
classification accuracy by only 2%. At the same time, when using a human
friendly loss function, the same compression system achieves competitive
performance in terms of MS-SSIM. By combining these two objective functions, we
show that there is a pronounced trade-off in compression quality between the

Habitability is examined as a function of insolation and planet rotation for an
Earth-like world with zero obliquity and eccentricity orbiting the Sun. We
assess fractional habitability using an aridity index that measures the net
supply of water to the land. Earth-like planets become ``superhabitable'' (a
larger habitable surface area than Earth) as insolation and day-length increase
because their climates become more equable, reminiscent of past warm periods on
Earth when complex life was abundant and widespread. The most slowly rotating,
most highly irradiated planets, though, occupy a hydrological regime unlike any
on Earth, with extremely warm, humid conditions at high latitudes but little
rain and subsurface water storage. Clouds increasingly obscure the surface as
insolation increases, but visibility improves for modest increases in rotation
period. Thus, moderately slowly rotating rocky planets with insolation near or
somewhat greater than modern Earth's appear to be promising targets for surface
characterization by a future direct imaging mission.

representations of events suitable for temporal segmentation in image
sequences, where events are understood as sets of temporally adjacent images
that are semantically perceived as a whole. However, although this approach
does not require expensive manual annotations, it is data hungry and suffers
from domain adaptation problems. As an alternative, in this work, we propose a
novel approach for learning event representations named Dynamic Graph Embedding
(DGE). The assumption underlying our model is that a sequence of images can be
represented by a graph that encodes both semantic and temporal similarity. The
key novelty of DGE is to learn jointly the graph and its graph embedding. At
its core, DGE works by iterating over two steps: 1) updating the graph
representing the semantic and temporal similarity of the data based on the
current data representation, and 2) updating the data representation to take
into account the current data graph structure. The main advantage of DGE over
state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches is that it does not require any
training set, but instead learns iteratively from the data itself a
low-dimensional embedding that reflects their temporal and semantic similarity.
Experimental results on two benchmark datasets of real image sequences captured
at regular time intervals demonstrate that the proposed DGE leads to event
representations effective for temporal segmentation. In particular, it achieves
robust temporal segmentation on the EDUBSeg and EDUBSeg-Desc benchmark
datasets, outperforming the state of the art. Additional experiments on two
Human Motion Segmentation benchmark datasets demonstrate the generalization
capabilities of the proposed DGE.

comet and a parent comet of the October Draconids meteor shower. If meteoroids
originating from a Jupiter-family comet contain complex organic molecules, such
as amino acids, they are essential pieces of the puzzle regarding the origin of
life on Earth. We observed comet 21P/G-Z in the mid-infrared wavelength region
using the Cooled Mid-infrared Camera and Spectrometer (COMICS) on the 8.2 m
Subaru Telescope on UT 2005 July 5. Here, we report the unidentified infrared
(UIR) emission features of comet 21P/G-Z, which are likely due to complex
organic molecules (both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons), and the thermal
emission from amorphous/crystalline silicates and amorphous carbon grains in
its mid-infrared low-resolution spectrum. The UIR features at ~8.2 micron, ~8.5
micron, and ~11.2 micron found in the spectrum of comet 21P/G-Z could be
attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (or hydrogenated amorphous
carbons) contaminated by N- or O-atoms, although part of the feature at ~11.2
micron comes from crystalline olivine. The other feature at ~9.2 micron might
originate from aliphatic hydrocarbons. Comet 21P/G-Z is enriched in complex
organic molecules. Considering that the derived mass fraction of crystalline
silicates in comet 21P/G-Z is typical of comets, we propose that the comet
originated from a circumplanetary disk of giant planets (similar to Jupiter and
Saturn) where was warmer than the typical comet-forming region (5-30 au from
the Sun) and was suitable for the formation of complex organic molecules.
Comets from circumplanetary disks might be enriched in complex organic
molecules, such as comet 21P/G-Z, and may have provided pre-biotic molecules to
ancient Earth by direct impact or meteor showers.

of this model can be approximated to a normal distribution, with mean and
variance related to the salt concentration used in the erythrocyte osmotic
fragility assay. The proposed model can generalize the classical Boltzmann
sigmoidal model often used in adjusting the stationary experimental data
distribution. A typical osmotic fragility curve is constructed from the
absorbance of free hemoglobin as a function of the decrease in NaCl (X)
concentration and allows the determination of H50, an osmotic fragility
variable that represents the saline concentration capable of promoting 50%
lysis, and dX, an osmotic stability variable that represents 1/4 of the
variation in salt concentration required to promote 100% lysis. Based on the
stationary distribution of the proposed model it is possible to stratify a
population into different groups of individuals with similar levels of cell
stability. These groups are very suitable to study the factors associated with
cell stability, such as gender, age and lipids, among others. The method
presented here was applied to a sample of 71 individuals and several results

in the design of spintronic devices mostly due to its astounding capability to
reach conduction band electron spin polarizations close to 100% at room

Ga$^{2+}$ paramagnetic centers is revisited in this paper to address
inconsistencies common to most previously presented models. Primarily, these
errors manifest themselves as major disagreements with the experimental
observations of two key characteristics of this phenomenon: the effective
Overhauser-like magnetic field and the width of the photoluminescence
Lorentzian-like curves as a function of the illumination power. These features
are not only essential to understand the spin dependent recombination in GaAsN,
but are also key to the design of novel spintronic devices. Here we demonstrate
that the particular structure of the electron capture expressions introduces
spurious electron-nucleus correlations that artificially alter the balance
between the hyperfine and the Zeeman contributions. This imbalance strongly
distorts the effective magnetic field and width characteristics. In this work
we propose an alternative recombination mechanism that preserves the
electron-nucleus correlations and, at the same time, keeps the essential
properties of the spin selective capture of electrons. This mechanism yields a
significant improvement to the agreement between experimental and theoretical
results. In particular, our model gives results in very good accord with the
experimental effective Overhauser-like magnetic field and width data, and with

biomarkers for mental illnesses is being increasingly recognized. However,
there are several unmet challenges in developing such biomarkers, including the
need for methods to model rapidly changing network states. In one of the first
such efforts, we develop a novel approach for computing dynamic brain
functional connectivity (FC), that is guided by brain structural connectivity
(SC) computed from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. The proposed approach
involving dynamic Gaussian graphical models decomposes the time course into
non-overlapping state phases determined by change points, each having a

such that the estimation of both the change points and the state-phase specific
networks are fully data driven and unsupervised, and guided by SC information.
The approach is scalable to large dimensions and extensive simulations
illustrate its clear advantages over existing methods in terms of network
estimation accuracy and detecting dynamic network changes. An application of
the method to a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) study reveals important
dynamic resting state connections in regions of the brain previously implicated
in PTSD. We also illustrate that the dynamic networks computed under the

trauma exposed individuals compared to existing dynamic and stationary

NVS allows for significantly higher event sampling rates at substantially
increased energy efficiency and robustness to illumination changes. However,
feature representation for NVS is far behind its APS-based counterparts,
resulting in lower performance in high-level computer vision tasks. To fully
utilize its sparse and asynchronous nature, we propose a compact graph
representation for NVS, which allows for end-to-end learning with graph
convolution neural networks. We couple this with a novel end-to-end feature
learning framework that accommodates both appearance-based and motion-based

which utilizes residual-graph convolutional neural networks (RG-CNN), for
end-to-end learning of appearance-based features directly from graphs. We
extend this with our proposed Graph2Grid block and temporal feature learning
module for efficiently modelling temporal dependencies over multiple graphs and
a long temporal extent. We show how our framework can be configured for object

our approach preserves the spatial and temporal coherence of spike events,

Strikingly, noncoding RNAs serves as the universal strongest regulators for all

our filtering algorithms. We also develop an efficient CPU implementation of
the SneakySnake algorithm for commodity desktops and servers. We evaluate the
benefits and downsides of our pre-alignment filtering approach in detail using
12 real datasets. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our hardware
pre-alignment filters show two to three orders of magnitude speedup over their
equivalent CPU implementations. We also demonstrate that integrating our
hardware pre-alignment filters with the state-of-the-art read aligners reduces
the aligner's execution time by up to 21.5x. Finally, we show that efficient
CPU implementation of pre-alignment filtering still provides significant
benefits. We show that SneakySnake on average reduces the execution time of the
best performing CPU-based read aligners Edlib and Parasail, by up to 43x and
57.9x, respectively.

sensors enable continuous measurement of activities of daily living, making
them especially well-suited for health research. Researchers have proposed
various human activity recognition (HAR) systems aimed at translating
measurements from smartphones into various types of physical activity. In this
review, we summarize the existing approaches to smartphone-based HAR. Methods:
We systematically searched Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed
articles published up to December 2020 on the use of smartphones for HAR. We
extracted information on smartphone body location, sensors, and physical
activity types studied and the data transformation techniques and
classification schemes used for activity recognition. Results: We identified
108 articles and described the various approaches used for data acquisition,
data preprocessing, feature extraction, and activity classification,
identifying the most common practices and their alternatives. Conclusions:
Smartphones are well-suited for HAR research in the health sciences. For
population-level impact, future studies should focus on improving quality of
collected data, address missing data, incorporate more diverse participants and
activities, relax requirements about phone placement, provide more complete
documentation on study participants, and share the source code of the
implemented methods and algorithms.

study shows the system is in a supersolid phase at weak disorder and a

large region of metastable states exists in both clean and disordered systems.
By comparing the phase diagrams for both clean and disordered systems, we find
that disorder suppresses metastable states and superfluidity. We compare these
results with the phase diagram of the extended Bose-Hubbard model with
nearest-neighbor interactions. Here, the supersolid phase does not exist even
at weak disorder. We identify two kinds of glassy phases: a Bose glass phase
and a disordered solid phase. The glassy phases intervene between the
density-wave and superfluid phases as the Griffiths phase of the Bose-Hubbard
model. The disordered solid phase intervenes between the density-wave and Bose
glass phases since both have a finite structure factor.

PACS/SPIRE cameras at 70-500 $\mu$m by the Herschel Gould Belt survey (HGBS).
We release new high-res. maps of column density and dust temperature. In the
filamentary sub-regions NGC2023/2024, NGC2068/2071, and L1622, 1768 starless
dense cores were identified, ~28-45% of which are self-gravitating prestellar
cores. A total of 76 protostellar dense cores were also found. The typical
lifetime of the prestellar cores was found to be $t_{\rm
pre}=1.7_{-0.6}^{+0.8}$ Myr. The prestellar core mass function (CMF) peaks at
~0.5 $M_\odot$ and is consistent with a power law with log slope -1.27$\pm$0.24
at the high-mass end, compared to the Salpeter slope of -1.35. In this region,
we confirm the existence of a transition in prestellar core formation
efficiency (CFE) around a fiducial value A_V_bg~7 mag in background visual
extinction, similar to the trend observed with Herschel in other clouds. This
is not a sharp threshold, but a smooth transition between a regime with very
low prestellar CFE at A_V_bg<5 and a regime with higher, roughly constant CFE
at A_V_bg$\gtrsim$10. The total mass in the form of prestellar cores represents
only ~20% of the dense molecular cloud gas at A_V_bg$\gtrsim$7 mag. About
60-80% of the prestellar cores are closely associated with filaments, and this
fraction increases up to >90% when a more complete sample of filamentary
structures is considered. Interestingly, the median separation between nearest
core neighbors corresponds to the typical inner filament width of ~0.1 pc
commonly observed in nearby molecular clouds. Analysis of the CMF observed as a
function of background cloud column density shows that the most massive
prestellar cores are spatially segregated in the highest column density areas,
and suggests that both higher- and lower-mass prestellar cores may form in
denser filaments.

plant roots to DNA packaging into viral capsids, as well as in applications
such as oil drilling processes. In many examples, chiral structures result from
the buckling of a straight fiber either with intrinsic twist or to which end
moments have been applied in addition to compression forces. Here, we elucidate
a generic way to form regular helicoidal shapes from achiral straight filaments
transported in viscous flows with free ends. Through a combination of
experiments using fluorescently labeled actin filaments in microfluidic
divergent flows and of two distinct sets of numerical simulations, we
demonstrate the robustness of helix formation. A nonlinear stability analysis
is performed and explains the emergence of such chiral structures from the
nonlinear interaction of perpendicular planar buckling modes, an effect that
solely requires a strong compressional flow, independent of the exact nature of
the fiber or type of flow field. The fundamental mechanism for the uncovered
morphological transition and characterization of the emerging conformations
advance our understanding of several biological and industrial processes and
can also be exploited for the controlled microfabrication of chiral objects.

reflected waves from the sample not only at the confocal pinhole, but also at
other non-confocal points. These additional measurements lead us to
constructing a time-resolved reflection matrix, with which the sample-induced
aberrations for the illumination and detection pathways are separately
identified and corrected. We realized in vivo reflectance imaging of myelinated
axons through an intact skull of a living mouse with the spatial resolution
close to the ideal diffraction limit. Furthermore, we demonstrated
near-diffraction-limited multiphoton imaging through an intact skull by
physically correcting the aberrations identified from the reflection matrix.
The proposed method is expected to extend the range of applications, where the
knowledge of the detailed microscopic information deep within biological

maximum possible number of individuals, and especially to those living in less

is hindered by a number of factors, among which the Intellectual Property
Rights (IPR) system plays a primary role. While opinions about the real effect
of IPRs in stimulating and disseminating innovation differ, there is a growing
number of authors arguing that a different approach may be more effective in
promoting global development. The success of the Open Source (OS) model in the
field of software has led analysts to speculate whether this paradigm can be
extended to other fields. Key to this model are both free access to knowledge
and the right to use other people's results.
  Abstract After reviewing the main features of the OS model, we explore
different areas where it can be profitably applied, such as hardware design and
production; we finally discuss how academical institutions can (and should)
help diffusing the OS philosophy and practice. Widespread use of OS software,
fostering of research projects aimed to use and develop OS software and
hardware, the use of open education tools, and a strong commitment to open
access publishing are some of the discussed examples.

  An Autonomous Vehicles Perspective","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1711.03938 by other authors",,,,"cs.CY cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The aviation industry has a market driven need to maintain and develop
enhanced simulation capabilities for a wide range of application domains. In
particular, the future growth and disruptive ability of smart cities,
autonomous vehicles and in general, urban mobility, hinges on the development
of state of the art simulation tools and the intelligent utilization of data.
While aviation based companies have several historical and/or proprietary
mission level simulation tools, there is much to learn from the current state
of the art within other industries (tangential and competing in scope), as well
as in academia. The purpose of this paper is to address and decompose the
simulation capabilities within the key players of the autonomous vehicle and
self-driving car industry (Toyota, Waymo, BMW, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Uber, etc.),
as well as several notable startups within the high fidelity 3D mapping and
simulation domain (Mapper, HERE, Cognata, etc.). While providing an overview of
how other companies are using simulation tools and reliable data-sets, this
paper will also seek to address several important and related questions,
namely: the interaction between simulation and supporting tools/software, the
intersection of simulation and the real world, the requirements and utilization
of compute infrastructure, the appropriate levels of fidelity within
simulation, and how simulation tools are critical to future safety and V&V
concerns. In order for aviation based companies to adequately pursue disruptive
mobility within real-world environments, be it in air or on the ground,
modeling and simulation tools for autonomous vehicles provide key insights into
future development work and are essential technologies.

cascading outages in a power grid still poses a big challenge to grid
operators. This paper proposes an online mitigation strategy against cascading
outages using an optimal power flow model based on a Dynamic Interaction Graph.
For a given power grid, its interaction graph, also called an interaction
model, was proposed in recent literature, which is composed of components and
links that have large contributions to outage propagation. Differing from a
conventional interaction graph, a Dynamic Interaction Graph can adaptively
update its parameters with changes of grid topology and hence is more accurate
in online identification of the most vulnerable transmission lines and likely
outage propagation paths for mitigation. Further, the paper introduces an
optimal power flow model based on the proposed Dynamic Interaction Graph for
determining the optimal control strategy to maintain transfer margins of
vulnerable transmission lines and effectively mitigate outage propagation. The
numerical results on the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed models and associated control strategy.
