objects where the usual notion of identity is not applicable, in the sense that
$x = x$ is not a formula, if $x$ is an arbitrary term. $\cal Q$ was partially
motivated by the problem of non-individuality in quantum mechanics. In this
paper I discuss the range of explanatory power of $\cal Q$ for quantum
phenomena which demand some notion of indistinguishability among quantum
objects. My main focus is on the double-slit experiment, a major physical
phenomenon which was never modeled from a quasi-set-theoretic point of view.
The double-slit experiment strongly motivates the concept of degrees of
indistinguishability within a field-theoretic approach, and that notion is
simply missing in $\cal Q$. Nevertheless, other physical situations may
eventually demand a revision on quasi-set theory axioms, if someone intends to
use it in the quantum realm for the purpose of a clear discussion about
non-individuality. I use this opportunity to suggest another way to cope with
identity in quantum theories.

of a single TLS, we use MMST dynamics to separately study both electronic ZPE

identify the contributions of self-interaction and vacuum fluctuations. More
importantly, we find that MMST dynamics can predict accurate quantum dynamics
for both electronic populations and electromagnetic field intensity in the high
saturation limit. For a single TLS in a cavity, MMST dynamics correctly predict
the initial exponential decay of spontaneous emission, Poincar\'e recurrences,
and the positional dependence of a spontaneous emission rate. For an array of
$N$ equally spaced TLSs with only one TLS excited initially, MMST dynamics
correctly predict the modification of spontaneous emission rate as a function

Furthermore, different network technologies have inherently heterogeneous

the heart of such design problems to formulate and propose computationally

  Approach","44 pages, 33 figures",,,,"cs.LG stat.CO stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Change detection in dynamic networks is an important problem in many areas,
such as fraud detection, cyber intrusion detection and health care monitoring.
It is a challenging problem because it involves a time sequence of graphs, each
of which is usually very large and sparse with heterogeneous vertex degrees,
resulting in a complex, high dimensional mathematical object. Spectral
embedding methods provide an effective way to transform a graph to a lower
dimensional latent Euclidean space that preserves the underlying structure of
the network. Although change detection methods that use spectral embedding are
available, they do not address sparsity and degree heterogeneity that usually
occur in noisy real-world graphs and a majority of these methods focus on
changes in the behaviour of the overall network.
  In this paper, we adapt previously developed techniques in spectral graph
theory and propose a novel concept of applying Procrustes techniques to
embedded points for vertices in a graph to detect changes in entity behaviour.
Our spectral embedding approach not only addresses sparsity and degree
heterogeneity issues, but also obtains an estimate of the appropriate embedding
dimension. We call this method CDP (change detection using Procrustes
analysis). We demonstrate the performance of CDP through extensive simulation
experiments and a real-world application. CDP successfully detects various
types of vertex-based changes including (i) changes in vertex degree, (ii)
changes in community membership of vertices, and (iii) unusual increase or
decrease in edge weight between vertices. The change detection performance of
CDP is compared with two other baseline methods that employ alternative
spectral embedding approaches. In both cases, CDP generally shows superior
performance.

symbolic algorithms on words and finite automata, we prove various new
decidability results for $2\times 2$ matrices over $\mathbb{Q}$. For that, we
introduce the concept of flat rational sets: if $M$ is a monoid and $N$ is a
submonoid, then flat rational sets of $M$ over $N$ are finite unions of the
form $L_0g_1L_1 \cdots g_t L_t$ where all $L_i$'s are rational subsets of $N$
and $g_i\in M$. We give quite general sufficient conditions under which flat
rational sets form an effective relative Boolean algebra. As a corollary, we
obtain that the emptiness problem for Boolean combinations of flat rational
subsets of $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Q})$ over $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ is
decidable (in singly exponential time). It is possible that such a strong
decidability result cannot be pushed any further for groups sitting between
$\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Q})$.
  We also show a dichotomy for nontrivial group extension of
$\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ in $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Q})$: if $G$ is a f.g.
group such that $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Z}) < G \leq \mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Q})$,
then either $G\cong \mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})\times \mathbb{Z}^k$, for some
$k\geq 1$, or $G$ contains an extension of the Baumslag-Solitar group
$\mathrm{BS}(1,q)$, with $q\geq 2$, of infinite index. In the first case of the
dichotomy the membership problem for $G$ is decidable. In the second case,
decidability of the membership problem for rational subsets in $G$ is open.
  In the last part we prove new decidability results for flat rational sets
that contain singular matrices. In particular, we show that the membership
problem is decidable for flat rational subsets of $\mathbb{Q}^{2\times 2}$ over
the submonoid that is generated by the matrices from $\mathbb{Z}^{2\times 2}$
with determinants in $\{-1,0,1\}$.

  Networks","New results added",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The new generation of machine learning processors have evolved from
multi-core and parallel architectures that were designed to efficiently
implement matrix-vector-multiplications (MVMs). This is because at the
fundamental level, neural network and machine learning operations extensively
use MVM operations and hardware compilers exploit the inherent parallelism in
MVM operations to achieve hardware acceleration on GPUs and FPGAs. However,
many IoT and edge computing platforms require embedded ML devices close to the
network in order to compensate for communication cost and latency. Hence a
natural question to ask is whether MVM operations are even necessary to
implement ML algorithms and whether simpler hardware primitives can be used to
implement an ultra-energy-efficient ML processor/architecture. In this paper we
propose an alternate hardware-software codesign of ML and neural network
architectures where instead of using MVM operations and non-linear activation
functions, the architecture only uses simple addition and thresholding
operations to implement inference and learning. At the core of the proposed
approach is margin-propagation (MP) based computation that maps multiplications
into additions and additions into a dynamic rectifying-linear-unit (ReLU)
operations. This mapping results in significant improvement in computational
and hence energy cost. In this paper, we show how the MP network formulation
can be applied for designing linear classifiers, shallow multi-layer
perceptrons and support vector networks suitable fot IoT platforms and tiny ML
applications. We show that these MP based classifiers give comparable results
to that of their traditional counterparts for benchmark UCI datasets, with the
added advantage of reduction in computational complexity enabling an
improvement in energy efficiency.

(PLS) has presented notable results in tasks such as image classification and
neural network optimization. However, PLS is infeasible on large datasets, such
as ImageNet, because it requires all the data to be in memory in advance, which
is often impractical due to hardware limitations. Additionally, this
requirement prevents us from employing PLS on streaming applications where the
data are being continuously generated. Motivated by this, we propose a novel
incremental PLS, named Covariance-free Incremental Partial Least Squares
(CIPLS), which learns a low-dimensional representation of the data using a
single sample at a time. In contrast to other state-of-the-art approaches,
instead of adopting a partially-discriminative or SGD-based model, we extend
Nonlinear Iterative Partial Least Squares (NIPALS) -- the standard algorithm
used to compute PLS -- for incremental processing. Among the advantages of this
approach are the preservation of discriminative information across all
components, the possibility of employing its score matrices for feature
selection, and its computational efficiency. We validate CIPLS on face
verification and image classification tasks, where it outperforms several other
incremental dimensionality reduction techniques. In the context of feature
selection, CIPLS achieves comparable results when compared to state-of-the-art
techniques.

preparation is key in any machine learning pipeline, but its effect on fairness
is yet to be studied in detail. In this paper, we evaluate how the fairness and
effectiveness of the learned models are affected by the removal of the
sensitive attribute, the encoding of the categorical attributes, and instance
selection methods (including cross-validators and random undersampling). We
used the Adult Income and the German Credit Data datasets, which are widely
studied and known to have fairness concerns. We applied each data preparation
technique individually to analyse the difference in predictive performance and
fairness, using statistical parity difference, disparate impact, and the
normalised prejudice index. The results show that fairness is affected by
transformations made to the training data, particularly in imbalanced datasets.
Removing the sensitive attribute is insufficient to eliminate all the
unfairness in the predictions, as expected, but it is key to achieve fairer
models. Additionally, the standard random undersampling with respect to the
true labels is sometimes more prejudicial than performing no random
undersampling.

strong reluctance to use these methods on safety-critical systems, which have
constraints on safety, stability, and real-time performance. We propose a
framework which satisfies these constraints while allowing the use of deep
neural networks for learning model uncertainties. Central to our method is the
use of Bayesian model learning, which provides an avenue for maintaining
appropriate degrees of caution in the face of the unknown. In the proposed
approach, we develop an adaptive control framework leveraging the theory of
stochastic CLFs (Control Lyapunov Functions) and stochastic CBFs (Control
Barrier Functions) along with tractable Bayesian model learning via Gaussian
Processes or Bayesian neural networks. Under reasonable assumptions, we
guarantee stability and safety while adapting to unknown dynamics with
probability 1. We demonstrate this architecture for high-speed terrestrial
mobility targeting potential applications in safety-critical high-speed Mars
rover missions.

(EnKF) and the feedback particle filter (FPF) are numerical algorithms to
approximate the solution of the nonlinear filtering problem in continuous time.
The distinguishing feature of these algorithms is that the Bayesian update step
is implemented using a feedback control law. It has been noted in the
literature that the control law is not unique. This is the main problem
addressed in this paper. To obtain a unique control law, the filtering problem
is formulated here as an optimal transportation problem. An explicit formula
for the (mean-field type) optimal control law is derived in the linear Gaussian
setting. Comparisons are made with the control laws for different types of EnKF
algorithms described in the literature. Via empirical approximation of the
mean-field control law, a finite-$N$ controlled interacting particle algorithm
is obtained. For this algorithm, the equations for empirical mean and
covariance are derived and shown to be identical to the Kalman filter. This
allows strong conclusions on convergence and error properties based on the
classical filter stability theory for the Kalman filter. It is shown that,
under certain technical conditions, the mean squared error (m.s.e.) converges
to zero even with a finite number of particles. A detailed propagation of chaos
analysis is carried out for the finite-$N$ algorithm. The analysis is used to
prove weak convergence of the empirical distribution as $N\rightarrow\infty$.
For a certain simplified filtering problem, analytical comparison of the m.s.e.
with the importance sampling-based algorithms is described. The analysis helps
explain the favorable scaling properties of the control-based algorithms
reported in several numerical studies in recent literature.

propose a new encoder-decoder model based on a structured neural

Natural-language problems to Formal-language solutions, called TP-N2F. The
encoder of TP-N2F employs TPR `binding' to encode natural-language symbolic
structure in vector space and the decoder uses TPR `unbinding' to generate, in
symbolic space, a sequential program represented by relational tuples, each
consisting of a relation (or operation) and a number of arguments. TP-N2F
considerably outperforms LSTM-based seq2seq models on two benchmarks and
creates new state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies show that improvements
can be attributed to the use of structured TPRs explicitly in both the encoder

interpretability of TP-N2F.

closely align with a system-level objective. Another feasible method to
accomplish the same goal is to subsidize the users' actions that are preferable
from a system-level perspective. We show that, when users behave similarly and
predictably, subsidies offer comparable performance guarantees to tolls while
requiring smaller monetary transactions with users; however, in the presence of
unknown player heterogeneity, subsidies fail to offer the same performance as
tolls. We further investigate these relationships in affine congestion games,
deriving explicit performance bounds under optimal tolls and subsidies with and

identifying the type of traffic that passes through the network. With the
widespread use of mobile devices, the vast diversity of mobile apps, and the
massive adoption of encryption protocols (such as TLS), large-scale encrypted
traffic classification becomes increasingly difficult. In this paper, we
propose a deep learning model for mobile app identification that works even
with encrypted traffic. The proposed model only needs the payload of the first
few packets for classification, and, hence, it is suitable even for
applications that rely on early prediction, such as routing and QoS
provisioning. The deep model achieves between 84% to 98% accuracy for the
identification of 80 popular apps. We also perform occlusion analysis to bring
insight into what data is leaked from SSL/TLS protocol that allows accurate app
identification. Moreover, our traffic analysis shows that many apps generate
not only app-specific traffic, but also numerous ambiguous flows. Ambiguous
flows are flows generated by common functionality modules, such as
advertisement and traffic analytics. Because such flows are common among many
different apps, identifying the source app that generates ambiguous flows is
challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN+LSTM model that uses
adjacent flows to learn the order and pattern of multiple flows, to better
identify the app that generates them. We show that such flow association
considerably improves the accuracy, particularly for ambiguous flows.
Furthermore, we show that our approach is robust to mixed traffic scenarios
where some unrelated flows may appear in adjacent flows. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that identifies the source app for ambiguous
flows.

systems, but they often perform deficiently in the field. A particularly
damaging problem is that DNN models often give false predictions with high
confidence, due to the unavoidable slight divergences between operation data
and training data. To minimize the loss caused by inaccurate confidence,
operational calibration, i.e., calibrating the confidence function of a DNN
classifier against its operation domain, becomes a necessary debugging step in
the engineering of the whole system.
  Operational calibration is difficult considering the limited budget of
labeling operation data and the weak interpretability of DNN models. We propose
a Bayesian approach to operational calibration that gradually corrects the
confidence given by the model under calibration with a small number of labeled
operation data deliberately selected from a larger set of unlabeled operation
data. The approach is made effective and efficient by leveraging the locality
of the learned representation of the DNN model and modeling the calibration as
Gaussian Process Regression. Comprehensive experiments with various practical
datasets and DNN models show that it significantly outperformed alternative

water vapor greenhouse positive feedback, heat transport efficiency, and
cooling through Rayleigh scattering as the dominant competing mechanisms that
determine the equilibrium climate for a given N$_2$ partial pressure. Finally,

can also determine image preference. Existing studies mainly focus on images

evaluates the aesthetic preference of images with auxiliary information. Our
method fully utilizes auxiliary data by introducing multi-step modality fusion
using both conditional batch normalization-based low-level and attention-based
high-level fusion mechanisms, inspired by the findings from statistical
analyses on real advertisement data. Our approach achieved state-of-the-art

identify the 21cm signal since the 21cm line emission has correlation with LAEs
while the LAEs are statistically independent of the foregrounds. So far, the
detectability of 21cm-LAE cross-power spectrum has been investigated with
simple LAE models where the observed Ly$\alpha$ luminosity is proportional to
the dark matter halo mass. However, the previous models were inconsistent with
the latest observational data of LAEs obtained with Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam

adopting a state-of-the-art LAE model consistent with all Subaru/HSC
observations such as the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function, LAE angular
auto-correlation, and the LAE fractions in the continuum selected galaxies. We
find that resultant cross-power spectrum with the updated LAE model is reduced
at small scales ($k\sim 1\ \rm Mpc^{-1}$) compared to the simple models, while
the amplitudes at large scales ($k \lesssim 0.2 \ \rm Mpc^{-1}$) are not
affected so much. We conclude that the large-scale signal would be detectable

different applications that involve learning on non-Euclidean data. However,
existing graph embedding models either fail to incorporate node attribute
information during training or suffer from node attribute noise, which
compromises the accuracy. Moreover, very few of them scale to large graphs due
to their high computational complexity and memory usage. In this paper we
propose GraphZoom, a multi-level framework for improving both accuracy and
scalability of unsupervised graph embedding algorithms. GraphZoom first
performs graph fusion to generate a new graph that effectively encodes the
topology of the original graph and the node attribute information. This fused
graph is then repeatedly coarsened into much smaller graphs by merging nodes
with high spectral similarities. GraphZoom allows any existing embedding
methods to be applied to the coarsened graph, before it progressively refine
the embeddings obtained at the coarsest level to increasingly finer graphs. We
have evaluated our approach on a number of popular graph datasets for both
transductive and inductive tasks. Our experiments show that GraphZoom can
substantially increase the classification accuracy and significantly accelerate
the entire graph embedding process by up to 40.8x, when compared to the
state-of-the-art unsupervised embedding methods.

(AVs), and the perception capabilities of AVs have been dramatically improved.
Various sensors installed on AVs, including, but are not limited to, LiDAR,
radar, camera and stereovision, will be collecting massive data and perceiving
the surrounding traffic states continuously. In fact, a fleet of AVs can serve
as floating (or probe) sensors, which can be utilized to infer traffic
information while cruising around the roadway networks. In contrast,
conventional traffic sensing methods rely on fixed traffic sensors such as loop
detectors, cameras and microwave vehicle detectors. Due to the high cost of
conventional traffic sensors, traffic state data are usually obtained in a
low-frequency and sparse manner. In view of this, this paper leverages rich
data collected through AVs to propose the high-resolution traffic sensing
framework. The proposed framework estimates the fundamental traffic state
variables, namely, flow, density and speed in high spatio-temporal resolution,
and it is developed under different levels of AV perception capabilities and
low AV market penetration rate. The Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) data is
adopted to examine the accuracy and robustness of the proposed framework.
Experimental results show that the proposed estimation framework achieves high
accuracy even with low AV market penetration rate. Sensitivity analysis
regarding AV penetration rate, sensor configuration, and perception accuracy
will also be studied. This study will help policymakers and private sectors
(e.g Uber, Waymo) to understand the values of AVs, especially the values of

efforts for injurious falls. There was no significant difference in the risk of
falls between males and females, yet if falls occurred, females were more

that clustering of foot traffic time series generates associations between

that the present multiplicity of scaling expressions for the energy confinement
time TE in tokamaks (Goldston, Kaye, Odajima-Shimomura, Rebut-Lallia, etc.) is
due both to the lack of variation of a key parameter combination in the

Ip = qeng/3.2, which partially reflects the tokamak to tokamak variation of the
dependence of TE on q and therefore implicitly the dependence of TE on Ip and

forms very close to most of the common scaling expressions. To reduce the

dispersion measures of $100-2000$\,pc/cm$^3$. The MWA has previously been used
to provide fast follow up for transient events including gamma-ray bursts, fast
radio bursts, and gravitational waves, using systems that respond to gamma-ray
coordinates network (GCN) packet-based notifications. We describe a system for
automatically triggering MWA observations of such events, based on VOEvent
triggers, which is more flexible, capable, and accurate than previous systems.
The system can respond to external multi-messenger triggers, which makes it
well-suited to searching for prompt coherent radio emission from gamma-ray
bursts, the study of fast radio bursts and gravitational waves, single pulse
studies of pulsars, and rapid follow-up of high-energy superflares from flare
stars. The new triggering system has the capability to trigger observations in
both the regular correlator mode (limited to $\geq 0.5$\,s integrations) or
using the Voltage Capture System (VCS, $0.1$\,ms integration) of the MWA, and
represents a new mode of operation for the MWA. The upgraded standard
correlator triggering capability has been in use since MWA observing semester
2018B (July-Dec 2018), and the VCS and buffered mode triggers will become
available for observing in a future semester.

very high Tc with respect to the energy scale of superconducting (SC) charges
inferred from the superfluid density (SFD). The observed linear dependence of
Tc on the SFD can hardly be expected in BCS SCs while being reminiscent of Bose
Einstein Condensation of pre-formed pairs. As additional non-BCS like
behaviors, responses similar to those in the bulk SC states have been observed
at temperatures (T) well above Tc in the vortex-like Nernst effect, diamagnetic
susceptibility, and transient optical conductivity in photo-excitation (PEX)
measurements. Here we propose a picture based on equilibrium and transient SFD
to understand these unconventional behaviors. This picture assumes: (1) Dynamic
SC responses in the Nernst and PEX measurements emerge at the formation of the
local phase coherence (LPC) among wave functions of pre-formed pairs. (2) Its
onset T (TLPC) is distinct from and lower than the pair-formation pseudo-gap T
(Tstr). (3) The bulk SC Tc is reduced from TLPC, due to the competition between
the SC and antiferromagnetic (AF) order. (4) The magnetic resonance mode (MRM)
controls Tc in the SC-AF competition. (5) The transient optical responses can
be attributed to a change of the balance between the competing SC and AF orders
caused by PEX. The assumptions (1) and (2) explain the relationship between Tc
and the transient SFD in PEX studies and equilibrium SFD in Nernst effect. (3)
and (4) are inferred from the linear dependence of Tc on the MRM energy. (4)
and (5) are consistent with the behaviors of the 400 cm-1 optical mode in
equilibrium and PEX studies, whose intensity represents the MRM intensity.
Unlike previous phase-fluctuation pictures which expect dynamic responses
between Tstr and Tc, the present picture involving competing order indicates
that dynamic SC responses are seen between TLPC and Tc.

research and data about migrants and migration cities, we propose a solution
that simultaneously focuses on data gathering from migrants, augmenting
awareness of the migrants to reduce mishaps, and setting up a mechanism to
present insights to the key stakeholders in migration to act upon. We have
designed a webapp for the stakeholders involved in migration: migrants, who
would participate in data gathering process and can also use the app for
getting to know safety and awareness tips based on analysis of the data
received; public health workers, who would have an access to the database of
migrants on the app; policy makers, who would have a greater understanding of
the ground reality, and of the patterns of migration through machine-learned
analysis. Finally, we have experimented with different machine learning models
on an artificially curated dataset. We have shown, through experiments, how
machine learning can assist in predicting the migrants at risk and can also
help in identifying the critical factors that make migration dangerous for
migrants. The results for identifying vulnerable migrants through machine
learning algorithms are statistically significant at an alpha of 0.05.

  work by Bruce Kleiner and Mario Bonk clarified and expanded",,,,"math.MG math.CA math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A carpet is a metric space which is homeomorphic to the standard Sierpi\'nski
carpet in $\mathbb{R}^2$, or equivalently, in $S^2$. A carpet is called thin if
its Hausdorff dimension is $<2$. A metric space is called Q-Loewner if its
$Q$-dimensional Hausdorff measure is Q-Ahlfors regular and if it satisfies a
$(1,Q)$-Poincar\'e inequality. As we will show, $Q$-Loewner planar metric
spaces are always carpets, and admit quasisymmetric embeddings into the plane.
In this paper, for every pair $(Q,Q')$, with $1<Q<Q'< 2$ we construct
infinitely many pairwise quasi-symmetrically distinct $Q$-Loewner carpets $X$
which admit explicit snowflake embeddings, $f: X\to S^2$, for which the image,
$f(X)$, admits an explicit description and is $Q'$-Ahlfors regular. In
particular, these $f$ are quasisymmetric embeddings. By a result of Tyson, the
Hausdorff dimension of a Loewner space cannot be lowered by a quasisymmetric
homeomorphism. By definition, this means that the carpets $X$ and $f(X)$
realize their conformal dimension. Each of images $f(X)$ can be further
uniformized via post composition with a quasisymmetric homeomorphism of $S^2$,
so as to yield a circle carpet and also a square carpet. Our Loewner carpets
$X$ are constructed via what we call an admissable quotiented inverse system.
This mechanism extends the inverse limit construction for PI spaces given in
\cite{cheegerkleinerinverse}, which however, does not yield carpets. Loewner
spaces are a particular subclass of PI spaces. They have strong rigidity
properties which which do not hold for PI spaces in general.

proliferation of affordable consumer-grade devices such as Oculus Rift, HTC
Vive, and Samsung VR. Amongst the various VR applications, 360{\deg} video
streaming is currently one of the most popular ones. It allows user to change
their field-of-view (FoV) based on head movement, which enables them to freely
select an area anywhere from the sphere the video is (virtually) projected to.
While 360{\deg} video streaming offers new exciting ways of consuming content
for viewers, it poses a series of challenges to the systems that are
responsible for the distribution of such content from the origin to the viewer.
One challenge is the significantly increased bandwidth requirement for
streaming such content in real time. Recent research has shown that only
streaming the content that is in the user's FoV in high quality can lead to
strong bandwidth savings. This can be achieved by analyzing the viewers head
orientation and movement based on sensor information. Alternatively, historic
information from users that watched the content in the past can be taken into
account to prefetch 360{\deg} video data in high quality assuming the viewer
will direct the FoV to these areas. In this paper, we present a 360{\deg} video
streaming system that transitions between sensor- and content-based predictive
mechanisms. We evaluate the effects of this transition-based approach on the
Quality of Experience (QoE) of such a VR streaming system and show that the
perceived quality can be increased between 50\% and 80\% compared to systems
that only apply either one of the two approaches.

signalled by an inversion in the average momentum from being dominated by
centre-of-mass momentum to relative momentum and also affects the global

competition between the interactions can also result in avoided crossings in
the groundstate which further enhances these correlations. However, we find
that correlations shared between the pseudo-spin states are strongly depressed

  odd-even effect","27+12 pages, 6 figures",,,"TIFR/TH/19-34","hep-th cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many quantum quench experiments involving cold atom systems the
post-quench system can be described by a quantum field theory of free scalars
or fermions, typically in a box or in an external potential. We work with free
scalars in arbitrary dimensions generalizing the techniques employed in our
earlier work \cite{Mandal:2015kxi} in 1+1 dimensions. In this paper, we
generalize to $d$ spatial dimensions for arbitrary $d$. The system is
considered in a box much larger than any other scale of interest. We start with
the ground state, or a squeezed state, with a high mass and suddenly quench the
system to zero mass (""critical quench""). We explicitly compute time-dependence
of local correlators and show that at long times they are described by a
generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE), which, in special cases, reduce to a thermal
(Gibbs) ensemble. The equilibration of {\it local} correlators can be regarded
as `subsystem thermalization' which we simply call 'thermalization' here (the
notion of thermalization here also includes equlibration to GGE). The rate of
approach to equilibrium is exponential or power law depending on whether $d$ is
odd or even respectively. As in 1+1 dimensions, details of the quench protocol
affect the long time behaviour; this underlines the importance of irrelevant
operators at IR in non-equilibrium situations. We also discuss quenches from a
high mass to a lower non-zero mass, and find that in this case the approach to
equilibrium is given by a power law in time, for all spatial dimensions $d$,
even or odd.

time (AFT) models have been widely used to deal with survival data in different
fields of knowledge. Despite their popularity, such models are not suitable to
handle survival data with crossing survival curves. Yang and Prentice (2005)
proposed a semiparametric two-sample approach, denoted here as the YP model,
allowing the analysis of crossing survival curves and including the PH and PO
configurations as particular cases. In a general regression setting, the
present work proposes a fully likelihood-based approach to fit the YP model.
The main idea is to model the baseline hazard via the piecewise exponential
(PE) distribution. The approach shares the flexibility of the semiparametric
models and the tractability of the parametric representations. An extensive
simulation study is developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed
model. In addition, we demonstrate how useful is the new method through the
analysis of survival times related to patients enrolled in a cancer clinical
trial. The simulation results indicate that our model performs well for
moderate sample sizes in the general regression setting. A superior performance
is also observed with respect to the original YP model designed for the
two-sample scenario.

accurate head model generation to provide target-specific stimulation. This

segmentation error, especially for low-contrast tissues. Additionally, a
uniform electrical conductivity is assigned to each tissue in the model, which
is an unrealistic assumption based on conventional volume conductor modeling.
This paper proposes a novel approach to the automatic estimation of electric
conductivity in the human head for volume conductor models without anatomical
segmentation. A convolutional neural network is designed to estimate
personalized electrical conductivity values based on anatomical information
obtained from T1- and T2-weighted MRI scans. This approach can avoid the
time-consuming process of tissue segmentation and maximize the advantages of
position-dependent conductivity assignment based on water content values
estimated from MRI intensity values. The computational results of the proposed
approach provide similar but smoother electric field results for the brain when

permutations in order to learn functions on unordered sets has become
prevalent. The most popular, basic models are DeepSets [Zaheer et al. 2017] and
PointNet [Qi et al. 2017]. While known to be universal for approximating
invariant functions, DeepSets and PointNet are not known to be universal when
approximating \emph{equivariant} set functions. On the other hand, several
recent equivariant set architectures have been proven equivariant universal
[Sannai et al. 2019], [Keriven et al. 2019], however these models either use
layers that are not permutation equivariant (in the standard sense) and/or use
higher order tensor variables which are less practical.
  There is, therefore, a gap in understanding the universality of popular
equivariant set models versus theoretical ones.
  In this paper we close this gap by proving that: (i) PointNet is not
equivariant universal; and (ii) adding a single linear transmission layer makes
PointNet universal. We call this architecture PointNetST and argue it is the
simplest permutation equivariant universal model known to date. Another
consequence is that DeepSets is universal, and also PointNetSeg, a popular
point cloud segmentation network (used eg, in [Qi et al. 2017]) is universal.
  The key theoretical tool used to prove the above results is an explicit
characterization of all permutation equivariant polynomial layers. Lastly, we
provide numerical experiments validating the theoretical results and comparing

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new aggregation framework for approximate dynamic programming,
which provides a connection with rollout algorithms, approximate policy
iteration, and other single and multistep lookahead methods. The central novel
characteristic is the use of a bias function $V$ of the state, which biases the
values of the aggregate cost function towards their correct levels. The
classical aggregation framework is obtained when $V\equiv0$, but our scheme
works best when $V$ is a known reasonably good approximation to the optimal
cost function $J^*$.
  When $V$ is equal to the cost function $J_{\mu}$ of some known policy $\mu$
and there is only one aggregate state, our scheme is equivalent to the rollout
algorithm based on $\mu$ (i.e., the result of a single policy improvement
starting with the policy $\mu$). When $V=J_{\mu}$ and there are multiple
aggregate states, our aggregation approach can be used as a more powerful form
of improvement of $\mu$. Thus, when combined with an approximate policy
evaluation scheme, our approach can form the basis for a new and enhanced form
of approximate policy iteration.
  When $V$ is a generic bias function, our scheme is equivalent to
approximation in value space with lookahead function equal to $V$ plus a local
correction within each aggregate state. The local correction levels are
obtained by solving a low-dimensional aggregate DP problem, yielding an
arbitrarily close approximation to $J^*$, when the number of aggregate states
is sufficiently large. Except for the bias function, the aggregate DP problem
is similar to the one of the classical aggregation framework, and its
algorithmic solution by simulation or other methods is nearly identical to one
for classical aggregation, assuming values of $V$ are available when needed.

using the generalized hydrodynamic theory. We mainly investigated the
spatio-temporal profile of charge density, energy density and their currents
using the partitioning protocol; the initial state consists of two
semi-infinite different thermal equilibrium states joined at the origin. In
this protocol, there appears around the origin a transient region where
currents flow. We examined how density and current profiles depend on initial
conditions and have found a clogged region where charge current is zero but
nonvanishing energy current flows. This region appears when one of the initial
states has half-filled electron density. We have proved analytically the
existence of the clogged region in the infinite temperature case of the
half-filled initial state. The existence is confirmed also for finite
temperatures by numerical calculations. A similar analytical proof is also
given for a clogged region of spin current when magnetic field is applied to
one and only one of the two initial states. A universal proportionality of
charge and spin currents is also proved for a special region, for general
initial conditions of electron density and magnetic field. Except for the
clogged region, charge and energy densities are in good proportion to each
other, and their ratio depends on the initial conditions. This proportionality
in nonequilibrium dynamics is reminiscent of Wiedemann-Franz law in thermal
equilibrium. The long-time stationary values of charge and energy currents were
also studied with varying initial conditions. We have compared the results with
the values of non-interacting systems and discussed the effects of electron
correlations. We have found that the temperature dependence of the ratio of
these stationary currents is strongly suppressed by electron correlations and
even reversed.

unique properties and potential applications in future nanoelectronics.
However, the thickness of ferroelastic domain walls remains elusive due to the
challenges in experimental characterization. Here, we determine the atomic
structure of ferroelastic domain walls and precisely measure the polarization
and domain wall thickness at picometer scale using annular bright field imaging
in an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope. We find
that the domain wall thickness in PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 and PbTiO3 thin films is
typically about one-unit cell, across which the oxygen octahedron distortion
behavior is in excellent agreement with first principles calculations.
Remarkably, wider domain walls about two-unit cells in thickness are also
observed for those domains walls are coupled with dislocations and underwent a
compressive strain. These results suggest that the thickness of ferroelastic
domain walls highly depends on their atomic environments. This study can help
us to understand the past debatable experimental results and provide further
insights into control of domain walls via strain engineering for their possible
applications in nanoelectronics.

information about user behavior for recommendation purposes. We study
sequential recommendation in a particularly challenging context, in which
multiple individual users share asingle account (i.e., they have a shared
account) and in which user behavior is available in multiple domains (i.e.,
recommendations are cross-domain). These two characteristics bring new
challenges on top of those of the traditional sequential recommendation task.
First, we need to identify the behavior associated with different users and
different user roles under the same account in order to recommend the right
item to the right user role at the right time. Second, we need to identify
behavior in one domain that might be helpful to improve recommendations in
other domains. In this work, we study shared account cross-domain sequential
recommendation and propose Parallel Split-Join Network (PSJNet), a parallel
modeling network to address the two challenges above. We present two variants
of PSJNet, PSJNet-I and PSJNet-II. PSJNet-I is a ""split-by-join"" framework that
splits the mixed representations to get role-specific representations and joins
them to obtain cross-domain representations at each timestamp simultaneously.
PSJNet-II is a ""split-and-join"" framework that first splits role-specific
representations at each timestamp, and then the representations from all
timestamps and all roles are joined to obtain cross-domain representations. We
use two datasets to assess the effectiveness of PSJNet. Our experimental
results demonstrate that PSJNet outperforms state-of-the-art sequential
recommendation baselines in terms of MRR and Recall.

On a photoluminescence image, every pixel corresponds to an LED chip's
brightness after photoexcitation, revealing performance information. But due to
unevenly distributed brightness values and varying defect patterns,
photoluminescence images are not yet employed for a comprehensive defect
detection. In this work, we show that fully convolutional networks can be used
for chip-wise defect detection, trained on a small data-set of
photoluminescence images. Pixel-wise labels allow us to classify each and every

and our experiments show that existing discrepancies between training images
and labels do not hinder network training. Using weighted loss calculation, we
were able to equalize our highly unbalanced class categories. Due to the
consistent use of skip connections and residual shortcuts, our network is able
to predict a variety of structures, from extensive defect clusters up to single

onto an anisotropic spin-2 chain when the ferromagnetic interaction is much
stronger than the antiferromagnetic interaction. Since there are many quantum
parameters in this system, we numerically obtained the GSPD on the plane of the
magnitude of the antiferromagnetic coupling versus its $XXZ$ anisotropy, by use
of the exact diagonalization, the level spectroscopy as well as the
phenomenological renormalization group. The obtained GSPD consists of six
phases. They are the $XY$1, the large-$D$ (LD), the intermediate-$D$ (ID), the
Haldane (H), the spin-1 singlet dimer (SD), and the N\'eel phases. Among them,
the LD, the H, and the SD phases are the trivial phases, while the ID phase is

connected without any quantum phase transitions. It is also emphasized that the
ID phase appears in a wider region compared with the case of the GSPD of the

their pulsations of hundreds of days, and long-term variations (LTVs) of years.
We tackled multi-colour and visual photometric data sets, looked for
photometric indications betraying eruptions or enhanced mass-loss episodes,
calculated stellar properties mainly using a published temperature calibration,
and investigated the nature of LTVs and their influence on quasi-periods and
stellar properties. The $BV$ photometry revealed a high-opacity layer in the
atmospheres. When the temperature rises the mass loss increases as well,
consequently, as the density of the high-opacity layer. As a result, the
absorption in $B$ and $V$ grow. The absorption in $B$, presumably of the order
of one to a few 0\fm1, is always higher than in $V$. This difference renders
redder and variable $(B-V)$ colour indexes, but the absorption law is unknown.
This property of YHGs is unpredictable and explains why spectroscopic
temperatures are always higher than photometric ones. We propose shorter
distances for $\rho$ Cas and HR 5171A than the accepted ones. Therefore, a
correction to decrease the blue luminescence of HR 5171A by polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules is necessary, and HR 5171A would no longer be a
member of the cluster Gum48d. HR 5171A is only subject to one source of light
variation, not by two as the literature suggests. Eruptive episodes of YHGs
prefer relatively cool circumstances when a red evolutionary loop (RL) has
shifted the star to the red on the HR diagram. After the eruption, a blue loop
evolution (BL) is triggered lasting one to a few decades. The reddening episode
of HR 5171A between 1960 and 1974 was most likely due to a red loop evolution,
and the reddening after the 1975 eruption was likely due to a shell ejection.

the qualitative notion of resource quantitatively. In a given resource theory,
free operations are physical processes that do not create the resource and are

free operation, what is its ability to preserve a resource? We axiomatically
formulate this ability as the resource preservability, which is constructed as
a channel resource theory induced by a state resource theory. We provide two
general classes of resource preservability monotones: One is based on state
resource monotones, and another is based on channel distance measures.
Specifically, the latter gives the robustness monotone, which has been recently
found to have an operational interpretation. As examples, we show that
athermality preservability of a Gibbs-preserving channel can be related to the
smallest bath size needed to thermalize all its outputs, and it also bounds the
capacity of a classical communication scenario under certain thermodynamic
constraints. We further apply our theory to the study of entanglement
preserving local thermalization (EPLT) and provide a new family of EPLT which
admits arbitrarily small nonzero entanglement preservability and free
entanglement preservation at the same time. Our results give the first

  Vulnerability",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The out-of-gas error occurs when smart contract programs are provided with
inputs that cause excessive gas consumption, and would be easily exploited to
make the DoS attack. Multiple approaches have been proposed to estimate the gas
limit of a function in smart contracts to avoid such error. However, under
estimation often happens when the contract is complicated. In this work, we
propose V-Gas, which could automatically generate inputs that maximizes the gas
cost and reduce the under estimation cases. V-Gas is designed based on
feedback-directed mutational fuzz testing. First, V-Gas builds the gas weighted
control flow graph (CFG) of functions in smart contracts. Then, V-Gas develops
gas consumption guided selection and mutation strategies to generate the input
that maximize the gas consumption. For evaluation, we implement V-Gas based on
js-evm, a widely used ethereum virtual machine written in javascript, and
conduct experiments on 736 real-world transactions recorded on Ethereum.
44.02\% of the transactions would have out-of-gas errors under the estimation
results given by solc, means that the recorded real gas consumption for those
recorded transactions is larger than the gas limit value estimated by solc.
While V-Gas could reduce the under estimation ratio to 13.86\%. Furthermore,
V-Gas has exposed 25 previously unknown out-of-gas vulnerabilities in those
widely-used smart contracts, 5 of which have been assigned unique CVE
identifiers in the US National Vulnerability Database.

suitable space of fractional differentiability. For the sake of simplicity and
to show the fundamental ideas behind our arguments, we will do this only for
the Riemann-Liouville case of linear equations with constant coefficients.
  In a few words, we study the natural consequences in fractional differential
equations of the already existing results involving existence and uniqueness
for their integral analogues, in terms of the Riemann-Liouville fractional
integral. Under this scope, we derive naturally several interesting results.
One of the most astonishing ones is that a fractional differential equation of
order $\beta>0$ with Riemann-Liouville derivatives can demand, in principle,
less initial values than $\lceil \beta \rceil$ to have a uniquely determined
solution. In fact, if not all the involved derivatives have the same decimal
part, the amount of conditions is given by $\lceil \beta - \beta_* \rceil$

Specifically, a $k$-assignment $L$ for a graph $G$ specifies a list $L(v)$ of
$k$ available colors to each $v \in V(G)$. An $L$-coloring assigns a color to
each vertex $v$ from its list $L(v)$. A proportional $L$-coloring of $G$ is a
proper $L$-coloring in which each color $c \in \bigcup_{v \in V(G)} L(v)$ is
used $\lfloor \eta(c)/k \rfloor$ or $\lceil \eta(c)/k \rceil$ times where
$\eta(c)=\left\lvert{\{v \in V(G) : c \in L(v) \}}\right\rvert$. A graph $G$ is
proportionally $k$-choosable if a proportional $L$-coloring of $G$ exists
whenever $L$ is a $k$-assignment for $G$. Motivated by earlier work, we
initiate the study of proportional choosability with a bounded palette by
studying proportional 2-choosability with a bounded palette. In particular,
when $\ell \geq 2$, a graph $G$ is said to be proportionally $(2,
\ell)$-choosable if a proportional $L$-coloring of $G$ exists whenever $L$ is a
$2$-assignment for $G$ satisfying $|\bigcup_{v \in V(G)} L(v)| \leq \ell$. We
observe that a graph is proportionally $(2,2)$-choosable if and only if it is
equitably 2-colorable. As $\ell$ gets larger, the set of proportionally $(2,
\ell)$-choosable graphs gets smaller. We show that whenever $\ell \geq 5$ a
graph is proportionally $(2, \ell)$-choosable if and only if it is
proportionally 2-choosable. We also completely characterize the connected
proportionally $(2, \ell)$-choosable graphs when $\ell = 3,4$.

dense structures (i.e., groups of vertices that exhibit a large number of
links), together with their temporal span (i.e., the period of time for which
the high density holds). In this paper we tackle this task by introducing a
notion of temporal core decomposition where each core is associated with two
quantities, its coreness, which quantifies how densely it is connected, and its
span, which is a temporal interval: we call such cores \emph{span-cores}.
  For a temporal network defined on a discrete temporal domain $T$, the total
number of time intervals included in $T$ is quadratic in $|T|$, so that the
total number of span-cores is potentially quadratic in $|T|$ as well. Our first
main contribution is an algorithm that, by exploiting containment properties
among span-cores, computes all the span-cores efficiently. Then, we focus on
the problem of finding only the \emph{maximal span-cores}, i.e., span-cores
that are not dominated by any other span-core by both their coreness property
and their span. We devise a very efficient algorithm that exploits theoretical
findings on the maximality condition to directly extract the maximal ones
without computing all span-cores.
  Finally, as a third contribution, we introduce the problem of \emph{temporal
community search}, where a set of query vertices is given as input, and the
goal is to find a set of densely-connected subgraphs containing the query
vertices and covering the whole underlying temporal domain $T$. We derive a
connection between this problem and the problem of finding (maximal)
span-cores. Based on this connection, we show how temporal community search can
be solved in polynomial-time via dynamic programming, and how the maximal
span-cores can be profitably exploited to significantly speed-up the basic
algorithm.

interesting possibility to study the adiabatic quantized pumping of bosonic

for bound bosonic pairs in the paradigmatic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model where
the ground state exhibits topological phase transitions due to dimerized
hoppings. At unit filling we show that there exist crossovers and phase
transitions to bond-order phases of paired bosons known as pair-bond-order
phase as a function of attractive interactions. The pair bond order phase is
found to exhibit effective topological properties such as the presence of
polarized paired edge states. This is further analyzed by studying the
emergence and breakdown of the Thouless charge pumping of this bound bosonic
pairs by a parametric extension to the famous Rice-Mele model. Finally we
discuss how the pumping of paired bosons or different regimes of breakdown of
charge pumping can be probed by state-of-the art experiments with repulsively
bound bosons.

defect is much higher than 1N-3B defect, the permeance of this defect is much
lower than industrial limits. To confirm the result obtained by DFT
calculations for gas separation performance of 1N-3B defect, the classical
molecular dynamics simulations were further carried out. Molecular dynamics
simulations confirm the results of DFT calculations except $H_2/CO_2$. It
demonstrates that the selectivity of $H_2$ will grow, if temperature rises.
This phenomenon is explainable by probability density distribution of the
$CO_2$ molecules at various temperatures. These simulations show that h-BN has
good adsorption for $CO_2$ molecules and is a suitable membrane for $CO_2$
capture. Finally, the excellent selectivity along with acceptable permeance
makes 1N-3B defects on h-BN, the promising membrane for He separation and $H_2$
