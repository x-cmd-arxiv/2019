nonequilibrium statistics of the interaction and on the interplay between the
system's geometry and the different dissipative processes occurring in
realistic setups. We show that the drag force can exhibit a markedly
nonadditive enhancement with respect to the corresponding additive

order of magnitude. This and similar configurations are of significant

input that are responsible for a model's output. An important family of
attribution methods is based on measuring the effect of perturbations applied
to the input. In this paper, we discuss some of the shortcomings of existing
approaches to perturbation analysis and address them by introducing the concept
of extremal perturbations, which are theoretically grounded and interpretable.
We also introduce a number of technical innovations to compute extremal
perturbations, including a new area constraint and a parametric family of
smooth perturbations, which allow us to remove all tunable hyper-parameters
from the optimization problem. We analyze the effect of perturbations as a
function of their area, demonstrating excellent sensitivity to the spatial
properties of the deep neural network under stimulation. We also extend
perturbation analysis to the intermediate layers of a network. This application
allows us to identify the salient channels necessary for classification, which,
when visualized using feature inversion, can be used to elucidate model
behavior. Lastly, we introduce TorchRay, an interpretability library built on
PyTorch.

summaries but should also tend to generate new conceptual words to express
concrete details. Inspired by the popular pointer generator
sequence-to-sequence model, this paper presents a concept pointer network for
improving these aspects of abstractive summarization. The network leverages
knowledge-based, context-aware conceptualizations to derive an extended set of
candidate concepts. The model then points to the most appropriate choice using
both the concept set and original source text. This joint approach generates
abstractive summaries with higher-level semantic concepts. The training model
is also optimized in a way that adapts to different data, which is based on a
novel method of distantly-supervised learning guided by reference summaries and
testing set. Overall, the proposed approach provides statistically significant
improvements over several state-of-the-art models on both the DUC-2004 and
Gigaword datasets. A human evaluation of the model's abstractive abilities also
supports the quality of the summaries produced within this framework.

stochastic picture of inflation and the resulting non-Gaussian curvature
perturbation, fully including the gravitational backreaction of the field's

demonstrate that consistency with the momentum constraint of General Relativity
prevents the field velocity from having a stochastic source, reflecting the
existence of a single scalar dynamical degree of freedom on long wavelengths.
We then focus on a completely level potential surface, $V=V_0$, extending from
a specified exit point $\phi_{\rm e}$, where slow roll resumes or inflation
ends, to $\phi\rightarrow +\infty$. We compute the probability distribution in
the number of e-folds $\mathcal{N}$ required to reach $\phi_{\rm e}$ which
allows for the computation of the curvature perturbation. We find that, if the
field's initial velocity is high enough, all points eventually exit through
$\phi_{\rm e}$ and a finite curvature perturbation is generated. On the
contrary, if the initial velocity is low, some points enter an eternally
inflating regime despite the existence of $\phi_{\rm e}$. In that case the
probability distribution for $\mathcal{N}$, although normalizable, does not
possess finite moments, leading to a divergent curvature perturbation.

using ten years of IceCube data collected between Apr.~6, 2008 and Jul.~10,
2018. We evaluate the significance of an astrophysical signal from a point-like
source looking for an excess of clustered neutrino events with energies
typically above $\sim1\,$TeV among the background of atmospheric muons and
neutrinos. We perform a full-sky scan, a search within a selected source
catalog, a catalog population study, and three stacked Galactic catalog
searches. The most significant point in the Northern hemisphere from scanning
the sky is coincident with the Seyfert II galaxy NGC 1068, which was included
in the source catalog search. The excess at the coordinates of NGC 1068 is
inconsistent with background expectations at the level of $2.9\,\sigma$ after
accounting for statistical trials. The combination of this result along with
excesses observed at the coordinates of three other sources, including TXS
0506+056, suggests that, collectively, correlations with sources in the
Northern catalog are inconsistent with background at 3.3$\,\sigma$
significance. These results, all based on searches for a cumulative neutrino
signal integrated over the ten years of available data, motivate further study
of these and similar sources, including time-dependent analyses, multimessenger
correlations, and the possibility of stronger evidence with coming upgrades to
the detector.

imbalanced learning. One approach to resolve this obstacle is data integration
or sharing, but due to privacy concerns neither is practical. Therefore, there
is an increasing demand for a platform on which an analysis can be performed in
a federated environment while maintaining privacy. However, it is quite
challenging to develop a federated learning algorithm that can address both
privacy-preserving and class imbalanced issues. In this study, we introduce a
federated generative model learning platform for generating samples in a
data-distributed environment while preserving privacy. We specifically propose
approximate Bayesian computation-based Gaussian Mixture Model called 'Federated
ABC-GMM', which can oversample data in a minor class by estimating the
posterior distribution of model parameters across institutions in a
privacy-preserving manner. PhysioNet2012, a dataset for prediction of mortality
of patients in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), was used to verify the performance
of the proposed method. Experimental results show that our method boosts
classification performance in terms of F1 score up to nearly an ideal
situation. It is believed that the proposed method can be a novel alternative
to solving class imbalance problems.

where $V_\varepsilon(f)$ is the greatest lower bound of Jordan variations
$V(g)$ of functions $g\in M^T$ such that $d(f(t),g(t))\le\varepsilon$ for all
$t\in T$. The notion of $\varepsilon$-variation $V_\varepsilon(f)$ was
introduced by Fra\'nkov\'a [Math. Bohem. 116 (1991), 20-59] for intervals
$T=[a,b]$ in $\mathbb{R}$ and $M=\mathbb{R}^N$ and extended to the general case
by Chistyakov and Chistyakova [Studia Math. 238 (2017), 37-57]. We prove
directly the following basic pointwise selection principle: If a sequence of
functions $\{f_j\}_{j=1}^\infty$ from $M^T$ is such that the closure in $M$ of
the set $\{f_j(t):j\in\mathbb{N}\}$ is compact for all $t\in T$ and
$\limsup_{j\to\infty}V_\varepsilon(f_j)$ is finite for all $\varepsilon>0$,
then it contains a subsequence, which converges pointwise on $T$ to a bounded
regulated function $f\in M^T$. We establish several variants of this result for
sequences of regulated and nonregulated functions, for functions with values in
reflexive separable Banach spaces, for the almost everywhere convergence and
weak pointwise convergence of extracted subsequences, and comment on the
necessity of assumptions in the selection principles. The sharpness of all
assertions is illustrated by examples.

implemented in OpenCL or CUDA. Using our Kernel Tuning Toolkit, we show that
with autotuning most of the kernels reach near-peak performance on various GPUs
and outperform baseline implementations on CPUs and Xeon Phis. Our evaluation
also demonstrates that autotuning is key to performance portability. In
addition to offline tuning, we also introduce dynamic autotuning of code
optimization parameters during application runtime. With dynamic tuning, the
Kernel Tuning Toolkit enables applications to re-tune performance-critical
kernels at runtime whenever needed, for example, when input data changes.
Although it is generally believed that autotuning spaces tend to be too large
to be searched during application runtime, we show that it is not necessarily
the case when tuning spaces are designed rationally. Many of our kernels reach
near peak-performance with moderately sized tuning spaces that can be searched
at runtime with acceptable overhead. Finally we demonstrate, how dynamic
performance tuning can be integrated into a real-world application from
cryo-electron microscopy domain.

electron dynamics by solving the single-particle density matrix equation of

tight-binding electronic states and a self-consistent electron-electron
interaction. While linear atomic chains constitute an idealized system, our
realistic 1D model readily provides insight on the temporal evolution of
electronic states in reciprocal space, both in the absence or presence of

complement this idealized system we also show results for HHG in more realistic

be in good qualitative agreement with the atomic chains. Our findings apply
directly to extreme nonlinear optical phenomena in atoms on surfaces,

this to show that certain deformation rings and Hecke algebras associated to a

intersections, provided the same was true at minimal level.
  In this paper we study Hecke algebras acting on cohomology of Shimura curves
arising from maximal orders in indefinite quaternion algebras over the
rationals localized at a semistable irreducible mod $p$ Galois representation
$\overline \rho$. If $\overline \rho$ is scalar at some primes dividing the
discriminant of the quaternion algebra, then Hecke algebra is still isomorphic

Gorenstein, so the Wiles numerical criterion cannot apply.
  We consider a weight 2 newform $f$ which contributes to the cohomology of the
Shimura curve and gives rise to an augmentation $\lambda_f$ of the Hecke
algebra. We quantify the failure of the Wiles numerical criterion at
$\lambda_f$ by computing the associated {\it Wiles defect} purely in terms of
the local behavior at primes dividing the discriminant of the global Galois
representation $\rho_f$ which $f$ gives rise to by the Eichler--Shimura

fears of potential discrimination, and a growing literature has begun to
develop fair statistical techniques. However, these techniques are often
specialized to one model context and based on ad-hoc arguments, which makes it
difficult to perform theoretical analysis. This paper develops an optimization
hierarchy, which is a sequence of optimization problems with an increasing
number of constraints, for fair statistical decision problems. Because our
hierarchy is based on the framework of statistical decision problems, this
means it provides a systematic approach for developing and studying fair
versions of hypothesis testing, decision-making, estimation, regression, and
classification. We use the insight that qualitative definitions of fairness are
equivalent to statistical independence between the output of a statistical
technique and a random variable that measures attributes for which fairness is
desired. We use this insight to construct an optimization hierarchy that lends
itself to numerical computation, and we use tools from variational analysis and
random set theory to prove that higher levels of this hierarchy lead to
consistency in the sense that it asymptotically imposes this independence as a
constraint in corresponding statistical decision problems. We demonstrate
numerical effectiveness of our hierarchy using several data sets, and we use
our hierarchy to fairly perform automated dosing of morphine.

corresponding Bayesian evidences. All four solutions appear to be
indistinguishable within their 2-$\sigma$ uncertainties. Nevertheless,

Many approaches have been tried and successfully applied to generate efficient
schedules in such settings. However, due to the computational complexity of the
scheduling problem in general, most approaches resort to heuristics to find a
non-optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time. We designed an integer
linear programming formulation to find an optimal schedule in a clinical
division of a hospital. Our formulation mitigates issues related to
computational complexity by minimizing the set of constraints, yet retains
sufficient flexibility so that it can be adapted to a variety of clinical
divisions.
  We then conducted a case study for our approach using data from the
Infectious Diseases division at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Canada. We
analyzed and compared the results of our approach to manually-created schedules
at the hospital, and found improved adherence to departmental constraints and
clinician preferences. We used simulated data to examine the sensitivity of the
runtime of our linear program for various parameters and observed reassuring
results, signifying the practicality and generalizability of our approach in
different real-world scenarios.

important for understanding how the Earth-Moon system evolved in the aftermath

lunar and terrestrial rocks to understand why moderately volatile elements are
depleted in the Moon. Combining our new measurements with previous data reveals
that the Moon has an 87Rb/85Rb ratio higher than Earth by +0.16 permil. This
isotopic composition is consistent with evaporation of Rb into a vapor medium
that was ~99 percent saturated. Evaporation under this saturation can also
explain the previously documented isotopic fractionations of K, Ga, Cu and Zn
of lunar rocks relative to Earth. We show that a possible setting for achieving
the same saturation upon evaporation of elements with such diverse volatilities
is through viscous drainage of a partially vaporized protolunar disk onto
Earth. In the framework of an alpha-disk model, the alpha-viscosity needed to
explain the ~99% saturation calculated here is 0.001 to 0.01, which is
consistent with a vapor disk where viscosity is controlled by magnetorotational
instability.

future logic nodes, additional metrology tools are needed. For this purpose,
grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) is being considered
because measurements are fast with a proven capability to reconstruct average
grating line profiles with high accuracy.
  Aim: GISAXS measurements of grating line shapes should be extended to samples
with pitches smaller than 50 nm and their defects. The method's performance
should be evaluated.
  Approach: A series of gratings with 32 nm pitch and deliberately introduced
pitchwalk is measured using GISAXS. The grating line profiles with associated
uncertainties are reconstructed using a Maxwell solver and Markov-Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) sampling combined with a simulation library approach.
  Results: The line shape and the pitchwalk are generally in agreement with
previously published transmission small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) results;
however the line height and line width show deviations of (1.0 +/- 0.2) nm and
(2.0 +/- 0.7) nm, respectively. The complex data evaluation leads to relatively
high pitchwalk uncertainties between 0.5 nm and 2 nm.
  Conclusions: GISAXS shows great potential as a metrology tool for small-pitch
line gratings with complex line profiles. Faster simulation methods would
enable more accurate results.

physical laws from astronomical data. The strategy allows for up to three
blinding stages, where the data may be blinded, the computations of theoretical
physics may be blinded, and --assuming Gaussianly distributed data-- the
covariance matrix may be blinded. We found covariance blinding to be
particularly effective, as it enables the blinder to determine close to exactly
where the blinded posterior will peak. Accordingly, we present an algorithm
which induces posterior shifts in predetermined directions by hiding
untraceable biases in a covariance matrix. The associated deblinding takes the
form of a numerically lightweight post-processing step, where the blinded
posterior is multiplied with deblinding weights. We illustrate the blinding
strategy for cosmic shear from KiDS-450, and show that even though there is no
direct evidence of the KiDS-450 covariance matrix being biased, the famous
cosmic shear tension with Planck could easily be induced by a
mischaracterization of correlations between $\xi_-$ at the highest redshift and
all lower redshifts. The blinding algorithm illustrates the increasing
importance of accurate uncertainty assessment in astronomical inferences, as
otherwise involuntary blinding through biases occurs.

components of a `quantum' matrix $M$ possess certain properties which resemble
structure theorems of the ordinary matrix theory. It turns out that such

representations of the BMW algebras. Particular series of such algebras include
orthogonal and symplectic types RTT- and RE- algebras, as well as their

elements of the characteristic subalgebra and derive recursive Newton and
Wronski relations between them. We also define an associative $\star$-product

galaxies (ETGs) in IllustrisTNG. To this end, we trace ETGs from $z=0$ to $z=4$
and measure the power-law slope $\gamma^{\prime}$ of the total density profile
for their main progenitors. We find that their $\gamma^{\prime}$ steepen on
average during $z\sim4-2$, then becoming shallower until $z=1$, after which
they remain almost constant, aside from a residual trend of becoming shallower
towards $z=0$. We also compare to a statistical sample of ETGs at different
redshifts, selected based on their luminosity profiles and stellar masses. Due
to different selection effects, the average slopes of the statistical samples
follow a modified evolutionary trend. They monotonically decrease since $z=3$,
and after $z\approx 1$, they remain nearly invariant with a mild increase
towards $z=0$. These evolutionary trends are mass-dependent for both samples,
with low-mass galaxies having in general steeper slopes than their more massive
counterparts. Galaxies that transitioned to ETGs more recently have steeper
mean slopes as they tend to be smaller and more compact at any given redshift.
By analyzing the impact of mergers and AGN feedback on the progenitors'
evolution, we conjecture a multi-phase path leading to isothermality in ETGs:
dissipation associated with rapid wet mergers tends to steepen
$\gamma^{\prime}$ from $z=4$ to $z=2$, whereas subsequent AGN feedback
(especially in the kinetic mode) makes $\gamma^{\prime}$ shallower again from
$z=2$ to $z=1$. Afterwards, passive evolution from $z=1$ to $z=0$, mainly
through gas-poor mergers, mildly decreases $\gamma^{\prime}$ and maintains the
overall mass distribution close to isothermal.

possible that it underwent a period of early matter domination driven by a
heavy particle or an oscillating scalar field that decayed into radiation
before the onset of Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The entropy sourced by this
particle's decay reduces the cross section required for thermal-relic dark
matter to achieve the observed abundance. This degeneracy between dark matter
properties and the thermal history vastly widens the field of viable dark
matter candidates, undermining efforts to constrain dark matter's identity.
Fortunately, an early matter-dominated era also amplifies density fluctuations
at small scales and leads to early microhalo formation, boosting the dark
matter annihilation rate and bringing smaller cross sections into the view of
existing indirect-detection probes. Employing several recently developed models
of microhalo formation and evolution, we develop a procedure to derive
indirect-detection constraints on dark matter annihilation in cosmologies with
early matter domination. This procedure properly accounts for the unique
morphology of microhalo-dominated signals. While constraints depend on dark
matter's free-streaming scale, the microhalos make it possible to obtain upper
bounds as small as $\langle\sigma v\rangle \lesssim 10^{-32}$ cm$^3$s$^{-1}$

  Aims: We model planets of different masses and semimajor axes in disks of
various viscosities and accretion rates to examine their impact on disk
thermodynamics and highlight the mutable, non-axisymmetric nature of icelines
in systems with massive planets.
  Methods: We conduct a parameter study using numerical hydrodynamics
simulations where we treat viscous heating, thermal cooling and stellar
irradiation as additional source terms in the energy equation, with some runs
including radiative diffusion. Our parameter space consists of a grid
containing different combinations of planet and disk parameters.
  Results: Both gap opening and shock heating can displace the iceline, with
the effects being amplified for massive planets in optically thick disks. The
gap region can split an initially hot (T>170 K) disk into a hot inner disk and
a hot ring just outside of the planet's location, while shock heating can
reshape the originally axisymmetric iceline into water-poor islands along
spirals. We also find that radiative diffusion does not alter the picture
significantly in this context.
  Conclusions: Shock heating and gap opening by a planet can effectively heat
up optically thick disks and in general move and/or reshape the water iceline.
This can affect the gap structure and migration torques. It can also produce
azimuthal features that follow the trajectory of spiral arms, creating hot
zones, ""islands"" of vapor and ice around spirals which could affect the
accretion or growth of icy aggregates.

counterpart in entropy gradient based on the first law of thermodynamics to
represent energy advection. The cooling process includes bremsstrahlung,
synchrotron radiation, and inverse Comptonization process. One of our main
ventures is to explain some long-standing issues of ultra-luminous X-ray
sources (ULXs). The existing physical scenarios to explain their unusual high
luminosity are either the existence of the missing class of intermediate-mass
BH (IMBH), or super-Eddington accretion around a stellar-mass BH. However, most
ULXs with steep power-law spectrum can be well explained through
super-Eddington accretion, while the existence of IMBH is indeed disputed
extensively. Nevertheless, the interpretation of ULXs with a hard power-law
dominated state remains mysterious. Here we show that our magnetically
dominated disc-outflow symbiosis around rapidly spinning stellar-mass BHs can
achieve such large luminosity even for sub-Eddington accretion rate. The
magnetic field at the outer zone of the advective flow is more than the
corresponding Eddington limit. Such field becomes dynamically dominant near the
BH through continuous accretion process due to flux freezing, but maintaining
its Eddington limit. This unique field configurations enhance the synchrotron,
and synchrotron self-Comptonization process to achieve very large luminosity.
Through the same mechanism, our solutions for supermassive BHs can explain the

mechanisms that might influence the evolution of protoplanetary discs and
therefore the formation of planetary systems. One of these mechanisms is
photoevaporation due to energetic radiation from the central star, which can in
principal explain the occurrence of discs with inner cavities like transition
discs. Current models, however, fail to reproduce a subset of the observed
transition discs, namely objects with large measured cavities and vigorous
accretion. For these objects the presence of (multiple) giant planets is often
invoked to explain the observations. In our work we explore the possibility of
X-ray photoevaporation operating in discs with different gas-phase depletion of
carbon and show that the influence of photoevaporation can be extended in such
low-metallicity discs. As carbon is one of the main contributors to the X-ray
opacity, its depletion leads to larger penetration depths of X-rays in the disc
and results in higher gas temperatures and stronger photoevaporative winds. We
present radiation-hydrodynamical models of discs irradiated by internal
X-ray+EUV radiation assuming Carbon gas-phase depletions by factors of 3,10 and
100 and derive realistic mass-loss rates and profiles. Our analysis yields
robust temperature prescriptions as well as photoevaporative mass-loss rates

November. In both episodes, the apparent isotropic gamma-ray luminosity exceeds
10^50 erg/s, with a doubling time scale of about 3 hours. The high gamma-ray
activity may be related to a superluminal knot that emerged from the core in
2015 April at the peak of the radio activity and is moving downstream along the
jet. The low variability observed in X-rays may indicate that X-ray emission is
produced by the low-energy tail of the same electron population that produces
the gamma-ray emission. The analysis of full-polarization pc-scale radio
observations suggests the presence of a limb-brightened polarization structure
at about 1 mas from the core in which a rotation measure gradient with a sign
change is observed transverse to the jet direction. These characteristics are
consistent with a scenario in which Faraday rotation is produced by a sheath of
thermal electrons with a toroidal magnetic field surrounding the emitting jet.

necessary to switch the magnetic state can be large, often close to the
destruction threshold of the device. We demonstrate that the resulting

fourfold rotational symmetry of the conductor. This symmetry breaking due to
film inhomogeneity produces signals, that resemble the anisotropic
magnetoresistance and is experimentally seen as a ""saw-tooth""-shaped transverse
resistivity. This artifact can persist over many repeats of the switching
experiment and is not easily separable from the magnetic contribution. We
discuss the origin of the artifact, elucidate the role of the film
crystallinity, and propose approaches how to separate the resistive

explain the ""surprising"" behavior of the same over-parametrized deep neural
networks that can generalize well on real datasets and at the same time
""memorize"" training samples when the labels are randomized. In this paper, we
demonstrate that deep ReLU networks generalize from training samples to new
points via piece-wise linear interpolation. We provide a quantified analysis on
the generalization ability of a deep ReLU network: Given a fixed point
$\mathbf{x}$ and a fixed direction in the input space $\mathcal{S}$, there is
always a segment such that any point on the segment will be classified the same
as the fixed point $\mathbf{x}$. We call this segment the $generalization \
interval$. We show that the generalization intervals of a ReLU network behave
similarly along pairwise directions between samples of the same label in both
real and random cases on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. This result suggests
that the same interpolation mechanism is used in both cases. Additionally, for
datasets using real labels, such networks provide a good approximation of the
underlying manifold in the data, where the changes are much smaller along
tangent directions than along normal directions. On the other hand, however,
for datasets with random labels, generalization intervals along mid-lines of
triangles with the same label are much smaller than those on the datasets with
real labels, suggesting different behaviors along other directions. Our
systematic experiments demonstrate for the first time that such deep neural
networks generalize through the same interpolation and explain the differences
between their performance on datasets with real and random labels.

explain the observed distribution of WD magnetic fields in polars and
pre-polars and the low-temperature WDs in pre-polars if it is re-scaled to fit
the observational data. Furthermore, in its present version, the model fails to
explain the absence of young close detached WD+M-dwarf binaries harbouring hot
magnetic WDs and predicts that the overwhelming majority of WDs in close

$d$ having precisely $\delta$ nodes as their only singularities has codimension
$\delta$ in the linear system of surfaces of degree $d$ for sufficiently large
$d$ and is of degree
$N_{\delta,complex}(d)=(4(d-1)^3)^\delta/\delta!+O(d^{3\delta-3})$. In
particular, this number is polynomial in $d$.
  By means of tropical geometry, we explicitly describe
$(4d^3)^\delta/\delta!+O(d^{3\delta-1})$ surfaces passing through a suitable
generic configuration of $n=\binom{d+3}{3}-\delta-1$ points in projective three
space. These surfaces are close to tropical limits which we characterize
combinatorially, introducing the concept of floor plans for multinodal tropical
surfaces. The concept of floor plans is similar to the well-known floor
diagrams (a combinatorial tool for tropical curve counts): with it, we keep the
combinatorial essentials of a multinodal tropical surface which are sufficient
to reconstruct the surface.
  In the real case, we estimate the range for possible numbers of real
multi-nodal surfaces satisfying point conditions. We show that, for a special
configuration $w$ of real points, the number $N_{\delta,real}(d,w)$ of real
surfaces of degree $d$ having $\delta$ real nodes and passing through $w$ is
bounded from below by $(\frac{3}{2}d^3)^\delta/\delta! +O(d^{3\delta-1})$.
  We prove analogous statements for counts of multinodal surfaces in $P^1\times
P^2$ and $P^1\times P^1\times P^1$.

  The initial nonlinear wave equation for the electromagnetic vector potential
is solved perturbatively about the known exact plane wave solution in both the
free vacuum case, as well as when a constant magnetic field is applied. A
nonlinear wave equation with nonzero convective part for the (relatively)
slowly varying amplitude of the first-order perturbation has been derived. This
equation governs the propagation of electromagnetic waves with a reduced speed
of light, where the reduction is roughly proportional to the intensity of the
initial pumping plane wave. A system of coupled nonlinear wave equations for
the two slowly varying amplitudes of the first-order perturbation, which
describe the two polarization states, has been obtained for the case of
constant magnetic field background.
  Further, the slowly varying wave amplitude behavior is shown to be similar to
that of a cnoidal wave, known to describe surface gravity waves in shallow
water. It has been demonstrated that the two wave modes describing the two
polarization states are independent, and they propagate at different wave
frequencies. This effect is usually called nonlinear birefringence.

three-dimensional color space, $V-H$, $I-J$, and $z-H$. We then derive the
best-fit spectral energy distributions of the training sample at the fixed
CANDELS median photometric redshifts to construct the new template library for
each individual color cube (i.e. color-cube-based template library). We derive
photometric redshifts (photo-z) of our target galaxies using our new
color-cube-based template library and with photometry in only a limited set of
bands, as expected for the aforementioned surveys. As a result, our method
yields $\sigma_{NMAD}$ of 0.026 and an outlier fraction of 6\% using only
photometry in the LSST and \Euclid/{\it Roman} bands. This is an improvement of
$\sim$10\% on $\sigma_{NMAD}$ and a reduction in outlier fraction of $\sim$13\%

quantum measurements and a plethora of quantum interpretations. The

and its detector is nonlocally entangled, suggesting that we turn to
nonlocality experiments for insight into measurements. By studying the full
range of superposition phases, these experiments show precisely what the
measurement state does and does not superpose. These experiments reveal that
the measurement state is not, as had been supposed, a paradoxical superposition
of detector states. It is instead a nonparadoxical superposition of two
correlations between detector states and system states. In this way, the
experimental results resolve the problem of definite outcomes (""Schrodinger's

argument does not yet resolve the measurement problem because it is based on
the results of experiments, while measurement is a theoretical problem: How can
standard quantum theory explain the definite outcomes seen experimentally?
Thus, we summarize the nonlocality experiments' supporting theory, which
rigorously predicts the experimental results directly from optical paths.
Several previous theoretical analyses of the measurement problem have relied on
the reduced density operators derived from the measurement state, but these
solutions have been rejected due to criticism of reduced density operators.
Because it avoids reduced density operators, the optical-path analysis is
immune to such criticism.

multi-modal images and temporal data involving multiple patient visits.
Conventional approaches, although useful for different image types, are time
consuming. Of late, deep learning (DL) based image registration methods have
been proposed that outperform traditional methods in terms of accuracy and
time. However,DL based methods are heavily dependent on training data and do
not generalize well when presented with images of different scanners or
anatomies. We present a DL based approach that can perform medical image
registration of one image type despite being trained with images of a different
type. This is achieved by unsupervised domain adaptation in the registration
process and allows for easier application to different datasets without
extensive retraining.To achieve our objective we train a network that
transforms the given input image pair to a latent feature space vector using
autoencoders. The resultant encoded feature space is used to generate the
registered images with the help of generative adversarial networks (GANs). This
feature transformation ensures greater invariance to the input image type.
Experiments on chest Xray, retinal and brain MR images show that our method,
trained on one dataset gives better registration performance for other
datasets, outperforming conventional methods that do not incorporate domain
adaptation

powerful in the past twenty years, digital democracy has yet to realize its
potential for deliberative transformation. The undemocratic exploitation of
massive social media systems continued this trend, but it only worsened an
existing problem of modern democracies, which were already struggling to
develop deliberative infrastructure independent of digital technologies. There
have been many creative conceptions of civic tech, but implementation has
lagged behind innovation. This essay argues for implementing one such vision of
digital democracy through the establishment of a public corporation. Modeled on
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in the U.S., this entity would foster
the creation of new digital technology by providing a stable source of funding
to nonprofit technologists, interest groups, civic organizations, government,
researchers, private companies, and the public. Funded entities would produce
and maintain software infrastructure for public benefit. The concluding
sections identify what circumstances might create and sustain such an entity.

disciplines, is currently experiencing a dramatic influx of new methodologies
powered by modern machine learning techniques. Over the last few years, a
growing body of HEP literature has focused on identifying promising
applications of deep learning in particular, and more recently these techniques
are starting to be realized in an increasing number of experimental

studies is that rarer and more complex physics signatures can be identified
with the new set of powerful tools from deep learning. However, there is an
unstudied systematic risk associated with combining the traditional HEP
workflow and deep learning with high-dimensional data. In particular,
calibrating and validating the response of deep neural networks is in general
not experimentally feasible, and therefore current methods may be biased in
ways that are not covered by current uncertainty estimates. By borrowing ideas

bound the size of unaccounted for uncertainty. In addition to providing a
pragmatic diagnostic, this work will hopefully begin a dialogue within the

show that considering alternative topological measures based on local
sub-network environment improves our ability to identify systemic institutions.
To provide empirical evidence, we apply a two-step procedure. First, we recover
network communities (i.e. close-peer environment) on a spillover network of
financial institutions. Second, we regress alternative measures of
vulnerability on three levels of topological measures: the global level (i.e.
firm topological characteristics computed over the whole system), local level
(i.e. firm topological characteristics computed over the community) and
aggregated level by averaging individual characteristics over the community.
The sample includes $46$ financial institutions (banks, broker-dealers,
insurance and real-estate companies) listed in the Standard \& Poor's 500

based on close-peer environment. Such information is different from the one
embeds in traditional system wide topological metrics and is proved to be

GU's RT requirements based on the traveling salesman problem with time window
(TSPTW). Then, they are compared with exhaustive search and traveling salesman
problem (TSP) used as reference methods. While the exhaustive algorithm
achieves the best performance at a high computation cost, the heuristic
algorithm exhibits poorer performance with low complexity. As a result, the DP
is proposed as a practical trade-off between the exhaustive and heuristic
algorithms. Specifically, the DP algorithm results in near-optimal performance
at a much lower complexity. Secondly, for given feasible trajectories, we

the present work, we propose a novel fully convolutional neural network (CNN)
architecture to infer the solution of the Poisson equation on a 2D Cartesian
grid with different resolutions given the right hand side term, arbitrary
boundary conditions and grid parameters. It provides unprecedented versatility
for a CNN approach dealing with partial differential equations. The boundary
conditions are handled using a novel approach by decomposing the original
Poisson problem into a homogeneous Poisson problem plus four inhomogeneous
Laplace sub-problems. The model is trained using a novel loss function
approximating the continuous $L^p$ norm between the prediction and the target.
Even when predicting on grids denser than previously encountered, our model
demonstrates encouraging capacity to reproduce the correct solution profile.
The proposed model, which outperforms well-known neural network models, can be
included in a CFD solver to help with solving the Poisson equation. Analytical
test cases indicate that our CNN architecture is capable of predicting the
correct solution of a Poisson problem with mean percentage errors below 10%, an
improvement by comparison to the first step of conventional iterative methods.
Predictions from our model, used as the initial guess to iterative algorithms
like Multigrid, can reduce the RMS error after a single iteration by more than
90% compared to a zero initial guess.

uses a different hybridization compared to the space-time hybridized
discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method we presented previously in (Int. J. Numer.
Meth. Fluids 89: 519--532, 2019). In the space-time EHDG method the velocity
trace unknown is continuous while the pressure trace unknown is discontinuous
across facets. In the space-time HDG method, all trace unknowns are
discontinuous across facets. Alternatively, we present also a space-time
embedded discontinuous Galerkin (EDG) method in which all trace unknowns are
continuous across facets. The advantage of continuous trace unknowns is that
the formulation has fewer global degrees-of-freedom for a given mesh than when
using discontinuous trace unknowns. Nevertheless, the discrete velocity field
obtained by the space-time EHDG and EDG methods, like the space-time HDG
method, is exactly divergence-free, even on moving domains. However, only the
space-time EHDG and HDG methods result in divergence-conforming velocity
fields. An immediate consequence of this is that the space-time EHDG and HDG
discretizations of the conservative form of the Navier--Stokes equations are
energy stable. The space-time EDG method, on the other hand, requires a
skew-symmetric formulation of the momentum advection term to be energy-stable.

energy systems are currently operated by sequential markets, which interface
the technical and economic aspects of the systems. In that context, this study
introduces an electricity-aware heat unit commitment model, which seeks to
optimize the operation of the heat system while accounting for the
techno-economic interdependencies between heat and electricity markets. These
interdependencies are represented by bid-validity constraints, which model the
linkage between the heat and electricity outputs and costs of combined heat and
power plants and heat pumps. This approach also constitutes a novel market
mechanism for the coordination of heat and electricity systems, which defines
heat bids conditionally on electricity prices. Additionally, a tractable
reformulation of the resulting trilevel optimization problem as a mixed integer
linear program is proposed. Finally, it is shown on a case study that the

reduction in wind curtailment compared to a traditional decoupled unit

large extent. It has been discovered that O2 plasma treatment can convert WSe2
into WO3-x and substantially improve contact resistances of p-type WSe2 devices
by strong doping induced thinner depletion width. In this paper, we carefully
study the temperature dependence of this conversion, demonstrating an oxidation
process with a precise monolayer control at room temperature and multilayer
conversion at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the lateral oxidation of WSe2
under the contact revealed by HR-STEM leads to potential unpinning of the metal
Fermi level and Schottky barrier lowering, resulting in lower contact
resistances. The p-doping effect is attributed to the high electron affinity of
the formed WO3-x layer on top of the remaining WSe2 channel, and the doping
level is found to be dependent on the WO3-x thickness that is controlled by the
temperature. Comprehensive materials and electrical characterizations are

itself as shift of one leg of the filament by more than 25"" northward. At its

In addition, the evolution of the flare ribbon hooks is also consistent with
the occurrence of ar--rf reconnection as predicted by MHD simulations.
Specifically, the growing hook sweeps footpoints of preeruptive coronal
arcades, and these locations become inside the hook. Furthermore, the rr-rf

produced a large variety of algorithms for training robust models. Most of the
effective algorithms involve solving the min-max optimization problem for
training robust models (min step) under worst-case attacks (max step). However,
they often suffer from high computational cost from running several inner
maximization iterations (to find an optimal attack) inside every outer
minimization iteration. Therefore, it becomes difficult to readily apply such
algorithms for moderate to large size real world data sets. To alleviate this,
we explore the effectiveness of iterative descent-ascent algorithms where the
maximization and minimization steps are executed in an alternate fashion to
simultaneously obtain the worst-case attack and the corresponding robust model.
Specifically, we propose a novel discrete-time dynamical system-based algorithm
that aims to find the saddle point of a min-max optimization problem in the
presence of uncertainties. Under the assumptions that the cost function is
convex and uncertainties enter concavely in the robust learning problem, we
analytically show that our algorithm converges asymptotically to the robust
optimal solution under a general adversarial budget constraints as induced by
$\ell_p$ norm, for $1\leq p\leq \infty$. Based on our proposed analysis, we
devise a fast robust training algorithm for deep neural networks. Although such
training involves highly non-convex robust optimization problems, empirical
results show that the algorithm can achieve significant robustness compared to
other state-of-the-art robust models on benchmark data sets.

composability (UC) and robust compilation (RC). In cryptography, UC is a
framework for the specification and analysis of cryptographic protocols with a
strong compositionality guarantee: UC protocols remain secure even when
composed with other protocols. In programming language security, RC is a novel
framework for determining secure compilation by proving whether compiled
programs are as secure as their source-level counterparts no matter what
target-level code they interact with. Presently, these disciplines are studied
in isolation, though we argue that there is a deep connection between them and
exploring this connection will benefit both research fields. This paper
formally proves the connection between UC and RC and then it explores the
benefits of this connection. For this, this paper first identifies which
conditions must programming languages fulfil in order to possibly attain
UC-like composition. Then, it proves UC of both an existing and a new
commitment protocol as a corollary of the related compilers attaining RC.
Finally, it mechanises these proofs in Deepsec, obtaining symbolic guarantees
that the protocol is indeed UC. Our connection lays the groundwork towards a
better and deeper understanding of both UC and RC, and the benefits we showcase
from this connection provide first evidence of scalable mechanised proofs for
UC.

signifying nontrivial features of the environment with which is interacting. We
use a general measure that is based on the trace distance for the degree of
non-Markovian behavior in open quantum systems. The witness of non-Markovianity
takes on nonzero values whenever there is a flow of information from the
environment back to the open system. We have shown that the dynamics of the
system with isotropic Heisenberg interaction is Markovian. A dynamical
transition into the non-Markovian regime is observed as soon as the anisotropy,
{\gamma}, is applied. At the Ising value of the anisotropy {\gamma} = 1.0, all
the information flows back from the environment to the system. The additional
dynamical transition from the non-Markovian to the Markovian is obtained by
applying the transverse magnetic field. In addition, we have focused on the
time evolution of the Loschmidtecho return rate function. It is found that a
non-analyticity can be seen in the time evolution of the Loschmidt-echo return
rate function exactly at the critical points where a dynamical transition from

accessible and often vulnerable to compromise. Compromises can go unnoticed for
months, if not years, and recovery often involves a complete system rebuild. In
this paper, we propose n-m-Variant Systems, an adversarial-resistant software
rejuvenation framework for cloud-based web applications. We improve the
state-of-the-art by introducing a variable m that provides a knob for
administrators to tune an environment to balance resource usage, performance
overhead, and security guarantees. Using m, security guarantees can be tuned
for seconds, minutes, days, or complete resistance. We design and implement an
n-m-Variant System prototype to protect a Mediawiki PHP application serving
dynamic content from an external SQL persistent storage. Our performance
evaluation shows a throughput reduction of 65% for 108 seconds of resistance
and 83% for 12 days of resistance to sophisticated adversaries, given
appropriate resource allocation. Furthermore, we use theoretical analysis and
simulation to characterize the impact of system parameters on resilience to
adversaries. Through these efforts, our work demonstrates how properties of
cloud-based servers can enhance the integrity of Web servers.

out-of-distribution (OOD) samples nearly as confidently as in-distribution
samples. To tackle this challenge, some recent works have demonstrated the
gains of leveraging available OOD sets for training end-to-end calibrated CNNs.
However, a critical question remains unanswered in these works: how to
differentiate OOD sets for selecting the most effective one(s) that induce
training such CNNs with high detection rates on unseen OOD sets? To address
this pivotal question, we provide a criterion based on generalization errors of
Augmented-CNN, a vanilla CNN with an added extra class employed for rejection,
on in-distribution and unseen OOD sets. However, selecting the most effective
OOD set by directly optimizing this criterion incurs a huge computational cost.
Instead, we propose three novel computationally-efficient metrics for
differentiating between OOD sets according to their ""protection"" level of
in-distribution sub-manifolds. We empirically verify that the most protective
OOD sets -- selected according to our metrics -- lead to A-CNNs with
significantly lower generalization errors than the A-CNNs trained on the least
protective ones. We also empirically show the effectiveness of a protective OOD
set for training well-generalized confidence-calibrated vanilla CNNs. These
results confirm that 1) all OOD sets are not equally effective for training
well-performing end-to-end models (i.e., A-CNNs and calibrated CNNs) for OOD
detection tasks and 2) the protection level of OOD sets is a viable factor for
recognizing the most effective one. Finally, across the image classification
tasks, we exhibit A-CNN trained on the most protective OOD set can also detect
black-box FGS adversarial examples as their distance (measured by our metrics)
is becoming larger from the protected sub-manifolds.

buckling eigenvalue problem $Kx = \lambda K_Gx$, where $K$ is symmetric
positive semi-definite, $K_G$ is symmetric indefinite, and the pencil $K -

nullspace. Moreover, in practical buckling analysis of structures, bases for
the nullspace of $K$ and the common nullspace of $K$ and $K_G$ are available.
There are two open issues for developing an industrial strength shift-invert
Lanczos method: (1) the shift-invert operator $(K - \sigma K_G)^{-1}$ does not
exist or is extremely ill-conditioned, and (2) the use of the semi-inner
product induced by $K$ drives the Lanczos vectors rapidly towards the nullspace
of $K$, which leads to a rapid growth of the Lanczos vectors in norms and cause
permanent loss of information and the failure of the method. In this paper, we
address these two issues by proposing a generalized buckling spectral
transformation of the singular pencil $K - \lambda K_G$ and a regularization of
the inner product via a low-rank updating of the semi-positive definiteness of
$K$. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated by numerical examples,

temporally weighted motifs are useful for forecasting tasks in networks such as
predicting future links, or a future time-series variable of nodes and links.

when ML depends on real-world data that are highly distributed and rapidly
growing (e.g., data collected by mobile phones and video cameras all over the

computation. For example, when training data are distributed across data
centers that span multiple continents, communication among data centers can
easily overwhelm the limited wide-area network bandwidth, leading to
prohibitively high latency and high cost.
  In this dissertation, we demonstrate that the latency and cost of ML on

weights respectively for its multiple indicators. In addition, the number of
available indicators varies across subjects. We derive a pseudo likelihood for
the latent variable model with measure-specific weights. We investigate various
statistical properties of the latent variable model with measure-specific
sample weights and its connection to the traditional factor analysis. We found
that the latent variable model provides consistent estimates for its variances
when the measure-specific sample weights are properly re-scaled. Two estimation
procedures are developed - EM algorithm for the pseudo likelihood and
marginalization of the pseudo likelihood by directly integrating out the latent
variable to obtain the parameter estimates. This approach is illustrated by the
analysis of publicly reported hospitals with indicators and sample weights.
Numerical studies are conducted to investigate the influence of weights and
their sample distribution.

align along the easy-axis of the crystalline anisotropy. In contrast to this
conventional wisdom, we find that the AFM order parameter switches away from
the easy-axis below a critical anisotropy strength when an AFM is properly
tailored into a nano-structure. The switching time first decreases and then
increases with the damping. Above the critical anisotropy, the AFM order
parameter is stable and precesses under a microwave excitation. However, the
absorption peak is not at resonance frequency even for magnetic damping as low
as 0.01. To resolve these anomalies, we first ascertain the hidden role of
dipolar interaction that reconstructs the energy landscape of the nano-system

the boundary between underdamped and overdamped phases, where the observed

The model is thought to capture the essential physics of high-temperature
superconductors, magnetic insulators, and other complex emergent quantum
many-body ground states. Although the Hubbard model is greatly simplified as a
representation of most real materials, it has nevertheless proved difficult to
solve accurately except in the one-dimensional case. Physical realization of
the Hubbard model in two or three dimensions, which can act as quantum
simulators, therefore have a vital role to play in solving the
strong-correlation puzzle. Here we obtain a quantum phase diagram of the
two-dimensional triangular lattice Hubbard model by studying angle-aligned
WSe2/WS2 bilayers, which form moir\'e superlattices because of the difference
in lattice constant between the two two-dimensional materials. We probe both
charge and magnetic properties of the system by measuring the dependence of
optical response on out-of-plane magnetic field, and on gate-tuned carrier
density. At half filling of the first hole moir\'e superlattice band, we
observe a Mott insulating state with antiferromagnetic Curie-Weiss behavior as
expected for a Hubbard model in the strong interaction regime. Past half
filling, our experiment suggests an antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic quantum
phase transition near 0.6 filling. Our results establish a new solid-state

Uncertainty leads to cautious or incorrect decisions that cost time, money, and

the graph is simply anonymized by employing naive ID removal, recently,
$k-$anonymity is proposed to secure users' privacy against the structure-based
attack. Most of the work ensured graph privacy using fake edges, however, in
some applications, edge addition or deletion might cause a significant change
to the key property of the graph. Motivated by this fact, in this paper, we
introduce a novel method which ensures privacy by adding fake nodes to the

  First, we present a novel model which provides $k-$anonymity against one of
the strongest attacks: seed-based attack. In this attack, the adversary knows
the partial mapping between the main graph and the graph which is generated
using the privacy-preserving mechanisms. We show that even if the adversary
knows the mapping of all of the nodes except one, the last node can still have
$k-$anonymity privacy.
  Then, we turn our attention to the privacy of the graphs generated by
inter-domain routing against degree attacks in which the degree sequence of the
graph is known to the adversary. To ensure the privacy of networks against this
attack, we propose a novel method which tries to add fake nodes in a way that

image, audio, natural language, patch, and pixel classification tasks.
Nevertheless, as a typical, while important real-world application, the
adversarial attacks of online video object tracking that traces an object's
moving trajectory instead of its category are rarely explored. In this paper,
we identify a new task for the adversarial attack to visual tracking: online
generating imperceptible perturbations that mislead trackers along an incorrect
(Untargeted Attack, UA) or specified trajectory (Targeted Attack, TA). To this
end, we first propose a \textit{spatial-aware} basic attack by adapting
existing attack methods, i.e., FGSM, BIM, and C&W, and comprehensively analyze
the attacking performance. We identify that online object tracking poses two
new challenges: 1) it is difficult to generate imperceptible perturbations that
can transfer across frames, and 2) real-time trackers require the attack to
satisfy a certain level of efficiency. To address these challenges, we further
propose the spatial-aware online incremental attack (a.k.a. SPARK) that
performs spatial-temporal sparse incremental perturbations online and makes the
adversarial attack less perceptible. In addition, as an optimization-based
method, SPARK quickly converges to very small losses within several iterations
by considering historical incremental perturbations, making it much more
efficient than basic attacks. The in-depth evaluation on state-of-the-art
trackers (i.e., SiamRPN++ with AlexNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet-50, and SiamDW)
on OTB100, VOT2018, UAV123, and LaSOT demonstrates the effectiveness and
transferability of SPARK in misleading the trackers under both UA and TA with

The performance is further improved through efficient synchronization of the

animation has enabled 2D characters to appear on live broadcasts and streaming
platforms. A key requirement for live animation is fast and accurate lip sync
that allows characters to respond naturally to other actors or the audience
through the voice of a human performer. In this work, we present a deep
learning based interactive system that automatically generates live lip sync
for layered 2D characters using a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. Our
system takes streaming audio as input and produces viseme sequences with less
than 200ms of latency (including processing time). Our contributions include
specific design decisions for our feature definition and LSTM configuration
that provide a small but useful amount of lookahead to produce accurate lip
sync. We also describe a data augmentation procedure that allows us to achieve
good results with a very small amount of hand-animated training data (13-20

core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is extensively investigated. Initial abundances
of s-nuclei and other physical conditions are derived from an updated
calculation of the SN 1987A progenitor. The nuclear reaction network including
neutrino reactions is constructed with the variable order Bader-Deuflhard
integration method. We find that yields of 7Li and 11B significantly depend on
the stellar metallicity while they are independent of the weak s-process during
the stellar evolution. When the metallicity is high, there are more neutron
absorbers, i.e., 56Fe, 14N (from initial CNO nuclei), and 54Fe, and the neutron
abundance is small during the $\nu$-process. Since 7Be is predominantly
destroyed via 7Be(n,p)7Li, a change in the neutron abundance results in
different 7Be yields. Then, the calculated yield ratio 7Li/11B=0.93 for the
solar metallicity is larger than that for the SN 1987A 7Li/11B=0.80 by 16 % in
the inverted mass hierarchy case. We analyze contributions of respective

learning, in the context of dynamic pricing. We study a single-product dynamic
pricing problem over a selling horizon of $T$ periods. The demand in each
period is determined by the price of the product according to a linear demand
model with unknown parameters. We assume that before the start of the selling
horizon, the seller already has some pre-existing offline data. The offline
data set contains $n$ samples, each of which is an input-output pair consisting
of a historical price and an associated demand observation. The seller wants to
utilize both the pre-existing offline data and the sequential online data to
minimize the regret of the online learning process.
  We characterize the joint effect of the size, location and dispersion of the
offline data on the optimal regret of the online learning process.
Specifically, the size, location and dispersion of the offline data are
measured by the number of historical samples $n$, the distance between the
average historical price and the optimal price $\delta$, and the standard
deviation of the historical prices $\sigma$, respectively. We show that the
optimal regret is $\widetilde \Theta\left(\sqrt{T}\wedge \frac{T}{(n\wedge
T)\delta^2+n\sigma^2}\right)$, and design a learning algorithm based on the
""optimism in the face of uncertainty"" principle, whose regret is optimal up to
a logarithmic factor. Our results reveal surprising transformations of the
optimal regret rate with respect to the size of the offline data, which we
refer to as phase transitions. In addition, our results demonstrate that the
location and dispersion of the offline data also have an intrinsic effect on
the optimal regret, and we quantify this effect via the inverse-square law.

when the charged particle lies in Minkowski space-time with compact spatial
sections in one, two and/or three directions. We concretely examine the details
of these stochastic motions when the spatial section is endowed with different
globally homogeneous and inhomogeneous topologies. We also show that
compactification in just one direction of the spatial section of Minkowski
space-time is sufficient to give rise to velocity dispersion components in the
compact and noncompact directions. The question as to whether these stochastic
motions under vacuum fluctuations can locally be used to unveil global
(topological) homogeneity and inhomogeneity is discussed. In globally
homogeneous space topologically induced velocity dispersion of a charged
particle is the same regardless of the particle's position, whereas in globally
inhomogeneous the time-evolution of the velocity depends on the particle's
position. Finally, by using the Minkowskian topological limit of globally
homogeneous spaces we show that the greater is the value of the compact
topological length the longer is the time interval within which the velocity
dispersion of a charged particle is negligible. This means that no motion of a
charged particle under electromagnetic quantum fluctuations is allowed when
Minkowski space-time is endowed with the simply-connected spatial topology. The
ultimate ground for such stochastic motion of charged particle under
electromagnetic quantum vacuum fluctuations is a nontrivial space topology.

by density functional theory (DFT). The piezoelectric stress tensors $e_{ij}$
and elastic stiffness tensors $C_{ij}$ are reported by using density functional
perturbation theory (DFPT) and finite difference method (FDM). It is found that
the Young's modulus of $\alpha$-AsP monolayer shows very strong anisotropy, and
the armchair direction is very softer than zigzag direction, which provides
possibility for tuning easily piezoelectric coefficients along the armchair
direction. In considered strain range, uniaxial compressive (tensile) strain
along the armchair (zigzag) direction is found to raise observably both the
$e_{22}$ and $d_{22}$ (absolute value). In fact, both compressive strain along
the armchair direction and tensile strain along the zigzag direction
essentially reduce the lattice constants along the armchair direction, which
can enhance the piezoelectric coefficients. The $e_{ij}$ of $\beta$-AsP
monolayer as a function of strain is also studied to illustrate the importance
of particular puckered structure of $\alpha$-AsP in enhancing the piezoelectric
coefficients. A classic SnSe monolayer with puckered structure is used to
further declare that small strain along the armchair direction can effectively
improve the piezoelectric coefficients. For example, the $d_{22}$ of SnSe
monolayer at -3.5\% strain is up to 628.8 pm/V from unstrained 175.3 pm/V. For
SnSe monolayer, a large peak is observed for $e_{22}$, which is due to a
structural phase transition. For $e_{16}$ of SnSe monolayer, a large peak is
also observed due to the cross of lattice constants $a$ along the zigzag

performance by systematically trading off the bias, variance, robustness to

evaluations and $\mathcal{O}(\kappa \log(1/\varepsilon))$ communications to
converge to the same fixed point with the non-accelerated variant where

multiple local objective functions. Different from most of the existing works,
the local objective function of each agent is presented as the average of
finite instantaneous functions. The intention of this work is to solve
large-scale optimization problems where the local objective function is
complicated and numerous. Integrating the gradient tracking algorithm with
stochastic averaging gradient technology, we propose a novel distributed
stochastic gradient tracking (termed as S-DIGing) algorithm. At each time
instant, only one randomly selected gradient of a instantaneous function is
computed and applied to approximate the gradient of local objection function.
Based on a primal-dual interpretation of the S-DIGing algorithm, we show that
the S-DIGing algorithm linearly converges to the global optimal solution when
step-size lies in an explicit internal under the assumptions that the
instantaneous functions are strongly convex and have Lipschitz-continuous
gradient. Numerical experiments on the logistic regression problem are
presented to demonstrate the practicability of the algorithm and correctness of

observations of compact binary coalescences provides a compelling argument that
the remnant object is indeed a black hole as described by the general theory of
relativity. This requires performing a spectroscopic analysis of the
post-merger signal and resolving the frequencies of either different angular
modes or overtones (of the same angular mode). For a nearly-equal mass binary
black-hole system, only the dominant angular mode ($l=m=2$) is sufficiently
excited and the overtones are instrumental to perform this test. Here we
investigate the robustness of modelling the post-merger signal of a binary
black hole coalescence as a superposition of overtones. Further, we study the
bias expected in the recovered frequencies as a function of the start time of a
spectroscopic analysis and provide a computationally cheap procedure to choose
it based on the interplay between the expected statistical error due to the
detector noise and the systematic errors due to waveform modelling. Moreover,
since the overtone frequencies are closely spaced, we find that resolving the
overtones is particularly challenging and requires a loud ringdown signal.
Rayleigh's resolvability criterion suggests that in an optimistic scenario a
ringdown signal-to-noise ratio larger than $\sim 30$ (achievable possibly with
LIGO at design sensitivity and routinely with future interferometers such as
Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, and LISA) is necessary to resolve the
overtone frequencies. We then conclude by discussing some conceptual issues
associated with black-hole spectroscopy with overtones.

binary SMBH (SMBBH) is currently ongoing. Elliptical SMBBH systems (i.e. both
orbits and disc-like broad-line regions (BLR) are elliptic) have not been
assessed in two-dimensional transfer functions (2DTF) studies. We aim to
numerically infer such a 2DTF because the geometry of the unresolved region is
imprinted on their optical emission. Through this, we determine their specific
kinematical signatures. We simulated the geometry and kinematics of SMBBH whose
components are on elliptical orbits. Each SMBH had a disc-like elliptical BLR.
The SMBHs were active and orbited each other tightly at a subparsec distance.
  Here we calculate for the first time 2DTF, as defined in the velocity-time
delay plane, for several elliptical configurations of SMBBH orbits and their
BLRs. We find that these very complex configurations are clearly resolved in
maps. These results are distinct from those obtained from circular and
disc-wind geometry. We calculate the expected line variability for all SMBBH
configurations. We show that the line shapes are influenced by the orbital
phase of the SMBBH. Some line profiles resemble observed profiles, but they can
also be much deformed to look like those from the disc-wind model.
  First, our results imply that using our 2DTF, we can detect and quantify
kinematic signatures of elliptical SMBBH. Second, the calculated expected line
profiles share some intriguing similarities with observed profiles, but also
with some profiles that are synthesised in disc-wind models. To overcome the
non-uniqueness of the spectral line shapes as markers of SMBBH, they must be
accompanied with 2DTF.

reverberation reduction is proposed. Reflecting that variance of the late
reverberation is time-varying and it depends on past speech source variance,
the proposed model is defined as convolution of a speech source variance with a
multi-channel time-invariant covariance matrix of late reverberation. The
multi-channel time-invariant covariance matrix can be interpreted as a
covariance matrix of a multi-channel acoustic transfer function (ATF). An
advantageous point of the covariance matrix model against a deterministic ATF
model is that the covariance matrix model is robust against fluctuation of the
ATF. We propose two covariance matrix models. The first model is a covariance
matrix model of late reverberation in the original microphone input signal. The
second one is a covariance matrix model of late reverberation in an extended
microphone input signal which includes not only current microphone input signal
but also past microphone input signal. The second one considers correlation
between the current microphone input signal and the past microphone input
signal. Experimental results show that the proposed method effectively reduces
reverberation especially in a time-varying ATF scenario and the second model is
shown to be more effective than the first model.

classification task and use a pixel-wise classification error as their
optimization criterions. However, the pixel-wise error ignores the strong
dependencies among the pixels in an image, which limits the performance of the
model. Several ways to incorporate the structure information of the objects
have been investigated, \eg, conditional random fields (CRF), image structure
priors based methods, and generative adversarial network (GAN). Nevertheless,
these methods usually require extra model branches or additional memories, and
some of them show limited improvements. In contrast, we propose a simple yet
effective structural similarity loss (SSL) to encode the structure information
of the objects, which only requires a few additional computational resources in
the training phase. Inspired by the widely-used structural similarity (SSIM)
index in image quality assessment, we use the linear correlation between two
images to quantify their structural similarity. And the goal of the proposed
SSL is to pay more attention to the positions, whose associated predictions
lead to a low degree of linear correlation between two corresponding regions in
the ground truth map and the predicted map. Thus the model can achieve a strong
structural similarity between the two maps through minimizing the SSL over the
whole map. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve
substantial and consistent improvements in performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012
and Cityscapes datasets. The code will be released soon.

nonconvex optimization problem. We solve the problem by graph projection
splitting (GPS), where the two proximity subproblems and the graph projection
step can be solved efficiently. With slight modification, we also propose a
robust graph projection splitting (RGPS) method to stabilize the iteration for
noisy measurements. Contrary to intuition, RGPS outperforms GPS with fewer
iterations to locate a satisfying solution even for noiseless case. Based on
the connection between GPS and Douglas-Rachford iteration, under mild
conditions on the sampling vectors, we analyze the fixed point sets and provide
the local convergence of GPS and RGPS applied to noiseless phase retrieval
without prior information. For noisy case, we provide the error bound of the
reconstruction. Compared to other existing methods, thanks for the splitting
approach, GPS and RGPS can efficiently solve phase retrieval with prior
information regularization for general sampling vectors which are not
necessarily isometric. For Gaussian phase retrieval, compared to existing
gradient flow approaches, numerical results show that GPS and RGPS are much
less sensitive to the initialization. Thus they markedly improve the phase
transition in noiseless case and reconstruction in the presence of noise
respectively. GPS shows sharpest phase transition among existing methods
including RGPS, while it needs more iterations than RGPS when the number of
measurement is large enough. RGPS outperforms GPS in terms of stability for
noisy measurements. When applying RGPS to more general non-Gaussian
measurements with prior information, such as support, sparsity and TV
minimization, RGPS either outperforms state-of-the-art solvers or can be
combined with state-of-the-art solvers to improve their reconstruction quality.

first-order dynamics of NN during a gradient-descent (GD) optimization were
related to gradient similarity kernel, also known as Neural Tangent Kernel

with its properties being defined entirely by NN architecture and independent
of the learning task at hand. In contrast, in this paper we empirically explore
these properties along the optimization and show that in practical applications
the NTK changes in a very dramatic and meaningful way, with its top
eigenfunctions aligning toward the target function learned by NN. Moreover,
these top eigenfunctions serve as basis functions for NN output - a function
represented by NN is spanned almost completely by them for the entire
optimization process. Further, since the learning along top eigenfunctions is
typically fast, their alignment with the target function improves the overall
optimization performance. In addition, we study how the neural spectrum is
affected by learning rate decay, typically done by practitioners, showing
various trends in the kernel behavior. We argue that the presented phenomena

(NDT) techniques, especially for conductive materials. Reconstructing the crack
profile from measured EC signals is one of the main goals of ECT. This task is
highly challenging, as the EC signals are nonlinear responses resulted from the
presence of cracks, and reconstructing the crack profile requires establishing
the forward model of the nonlinear electromagnetic dynamics and solving its
inverse problem, which is an ill-posed numerical optimization problem. Instead
of solving the inverse problem numerically, we propose to directly learn the
inverse mapping from EC signals to crack profiles with a deep encoder-decoder
convolutional neural network named EddyNet. EddyNet is trained on a set of
randomly generated crack profiles and the corresponding simulated EC responses
generated from a realistic forward model. On the held-out test data, EddyNet
achieved a mean absolute error of 0.198 between predicted profiles and ground
truth ones. Qualitatively, the geometries of predicted profiles are visually
similar to the ground truth profiles. Our method greatly reduces the usual
reliance on domain experts, and the reconstruction is extremely fast both on
GPUs and on CPUs. The source code of EddyNet is released on

content popularity. To solve this problem, the primary contribution of this
work is to develop a novel dynamic content update strategy with the aid of deep
reinforcement learning. Considering that the BS is unaware of content
popularities, the proposed strategy dynamically updates the BS cache according
to the time-varying requests and the BS cached contents. Towards this end, we
model the problem of cache update as a Markov decision process and put forth an
efficient algorithm that builds upon the long short-term memory network and
external memory to enhance the decision making ability of the BS. Simulation
results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve not only a higher average

Specifically, if the Hamiltonian includes just a short-range repulsion among

metals, those electrons must be coupled to the full internal EMF, whose
longitudinal and transverse components are self-consistently related to the
electron charge and current densities through Gauss's and circuital laws,

modelling the non-equilibrium dynamics caused by the EMF, as in pump-probe

devices (e.g., sensor nodes) work steadily for a long time is one of the key
issues to improve the efficiency of the whole network. However, a lot of facts
have shown that the unattended equipments are prone to failure due to energy
exhaustion, physical damage and other reasons. This may result in the emergence
of energy-hole, seriously affecting network performance and shortening its
lifetime. To reduce data redundancy and avoid the generation of sensing blind
areas, a type of Virtual Force based Energy-hole Mitigation strategy (VFEM) is
proposed in this paper. Firstly, the virtual force (gravitation and repulsion)
between nodes is introduced that makes nodes distribute as uniformly as
possible. Secondly, in order to alleviate the ""energy-hole problem"", the
network is divided into several annuluses with the same width. Then, another
type of virtual force, named ""virtual gravity generated by annulus"", is
proposed to further optimize the positions of nodes in each annulus. Finally,
with the help of the ""data forwarding area"", the optimal paths for data
uploading can be selected out, which effectively balances energy consumption of
nodes. Experiment results show that, VFEM has a relatively good performance on
postponing the generation time of energy-holes as well as prolonging the
network lifetime compared with other typical energy-hole mitigation methods.

emission is spatially disconnected from the UV rest-frame emission. This
represents a challenge for modeling their spectral energy distributions with
codes based on an energy budget between the stellar and dust components. We
want to verify the validity of energy balance modeling on a sample of galaxies
observed from the UV to the sub-millimeter rest frame with ALMA and decipher
what information can be reliably retrieved from the analysis of the full SED
and from subsets of wavelengths. We select 17 sources at z~2 in the Hubble
Ultra-Deep Field and in the GOODS- South field detected with ALMA and Herschel
and for which UV to NIR. rest-frame ancillary data are available. We fit the
data with CIGALE exploring different configurations for dust attenuation and
star formation histories, considering either the full dataset or one that is
reduced to the stellar and dust emission. We compare estimates of the dust
luminosities, star formation rates, and stellar masses. The fit of the stellar
continuum alone with the starburst attenuation law can only reproduce up to 50%
of the total dust luminosity observed by Herschel and ALMA. This deficit is
found to be consistent with similar quantities estimated in the COSMOS field
and is found to increase with the specific star formation rate. The combined
stellar and dust SEDs are well fitted when different attenuation laws are
introduced. Shallow attenuation curves are needed for the galaxies whose cold
dust distribution is very compact compared to starlight. The stellar mass
estimates are affected by the choice of the attenuation law. The star formation
rates are robustly estimated as long as dust luminosities are available. The
large majority of the galaxies are above the average main sequence of star
forming galaxies and one source is a strong starburst.

subject to distributional uncertainty. Basically, the decision-maker attempts
to minimize her worst-case expected loss over an ambiguity set (or a family) of
candidate distributions that are consistent with the decision-maker's initial

prescribed linear first-order moment constraints with respect to subsets of

Ellis-Bronnikov spacetime as a special case. We first show how the required
total matter stress energy (which violates the local energy conditions) may be
split into a part due to a phantom scalar and another extra piece (which
vanishes for Ellis--Bronnikov) satisfying the Averaged Null Energy Condition
(ANEC) along radial null geodesics. Thereafter,we examine the effective
potential for scalar wave propagation in a general setting. Conditions on the
metric function, for which the effective potential may have double barrier
features are written down and illustrated (using this class of wormholes).
Subsequently, using numerous methods, we obtain the scalar quasinormal modes
(QNMs). We note the behaviour of the QNMs as a function of $n$ (the metric
parameter) and $b_0$ (the wormhole throat radius). Thus, the shapes and sizes
of the wormholes, governed by the metric parameter $n$ and the throat radius
$b_0$ are linked to the variation and the values of the QNMs. Finally, we
demonstrate how, for large $n$, the time domain profiles exhibit, expectedly,
the occurence of echoes. In summary, our results suggest that this family of
wormholes may indeed be used as a template for further studies on the
gravitational wave physics of exotic compact objects.

central stars are more luminous and evolve faster. We have slightly changed the
distribution of the [OIII] 5007 intensities relative to those of H$\beta$ and
the generation of absorbing factors, while still basing their numerical
modeling on empirical information extracted from studies of galactic planetary
nebulae (PNs) and their central stars. We argue that the assumption of PNs
being completely optically thick to H-ionizing photons leads to conflicts with
observations and show that to account for optically thin PNs is necessary. We
then use the new simulations to estimate a maximum final mass, clarifying its
meaning, and discuss the effect of internal dust extinction as a possible way
of explaining the persistent discrepancy between PNLF and surface brightness
fluctuation (SBF) distances. By adjusting the range of minimum to maximum final

model is constructed by reusing the historical population, which can predict

the original common message are combined as a \emph{super common} message. This
super common message is superposed on or concatenated to the private multicast
data vector, or it is transmitted via a mixed scheme. Simulations show that RS
demonstrates significant gains especially in overloaded systems.

the realistic host band-edge states instead of the virtual jellium state,
therefore, rendering it not only naturally keeps the supercell charge neutral,
but also has clear physical meaning. This realistic model reproduces the same
accuracy as the traditional jellium model for most of the 3D semiconducting
materials, and remarkably, for the low-dimensional structures, it is able to
cure the divergence caused by the artificial long-range electrostatic energy
introduced in the jellium model, and hence gives meaningful formation energies
of defects in charged state and transition energy levels of the corresponding
defects. Our realistic method, therefore, will have significant impact for the
study of defect physics in all low-dimensional systems including quantum dots,
nanowires, surfaces, interfaces, and 2D materials.

effect for realtime detecting radiowave absorption periods. The method is based
on two empirical autoregression models of noise dynamics. The first (rough)
prediction model is based on radar measurements of daily minimal noise dynamics
averaged over 28-days with specially calculated weight coefficients. The second
(fine) prediction model uses real-time scaling of rough model. The scaling is
based on the comparison of this model with the experimental noise observations
during previous 5 days. The models are based on the whole EKB ISTP SB RAS radar
dataset (2013-2018). The rough model allows one to estimate the boundary beyond
which the noise variations can be associated with absorption periods with a
high degree of certainty. A joint analysis of simultaneous data on neighboring
radar beams and at several frequencies reduces the detection errors, and allows
to identify absorption events with a higher degree of confidence. Use of fine
model allows to estimate absorption. The technique is validated by frequency
dependence of absorption during two-frequency measurements. The found frequency
dependence has an average exponent of the order of -1.5, which is in good
agreement with the literature data and the data obtained earlier in analysis of
solar X-ray flares. The use of the detection technique at EKB radar shows that
most probable absorption over absorption events is about -0.65dB. Analysis of
absorption of different amplitudes shows that low-intensity absorption events
(0..-1.3dB) have slight local time dependence and mostly observed at north
directions. For the storng absorption events (stronger than -1.3dB) the local
time dynamics correlates well with noise level dynamics, and usually fills the
whole radar field-of-view.

environments when there are large-scale and small-scale fading effects.
Furthermore, while the current key generation work mainly focuses on
short-range communications techniques such as WiFi and ZigBee, the exploration
with long-range communications, e.g., LoRa, is rather limited. This paper
presents a LoRa-based key generation testbed and reveals a new
colluding-eavesdropping attack that perceives and utilizes large-scale fading
effects in key generation channels, by using multiple eavesdroppers circularly
around a legitimate user. We formalized the attack and validated it through
extensive experiments conducted under both indoor and outdoor environments. It
is corroborated that the attack reduces secret key capacity when large-scale
fading is predominant. We further investigated potential defenses by proposing
a conditional entropy and high-pass filter-based countermeasure to estimate and
eliminate large-scale fading associated components. The experimental results
demonstrated that the countermeasure can significantly improve the key
generation's security when there are both varying large-scale and small-scale
fading effects. The key bits generated by legitimate users have a low key
disagreement rate (KDR) and validated by the NIST randomness tests. On the
other hand, eavesdroppers' average KDR is increased to 0.49, which is no better

widths bounds in case of Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions. These bounds
are explicitly controlled by signal's structural parameters r and s which

colors, is due to Bell, Hass, Rubinstein and Tillmann, and has been applied by
Spreer and Tillmann to colored triangulations associated to the so called
simple crystallizations of standard simply-connected $4$-manifolds. The present
paper performs a generalization of these ideas along two different directions:
first, we take in consideration also compact PL $4$-manifolds with connected
boundary, introducing a possible extension of trisections to the boundary case;
then, we analyze the trisections induced not only by simple crystallizations,
but by any 5-colored graph encoding a simply-connected $4$-manifold. This
extended notion is referred to as gem-induced trisection, and gives rise to the
G-trisection genus, generalizing the well-known trisection genus. Both in the
closed and boundary case, we give conditions on a 5-colored graph which ensure
one of its gem-induced trisections - if any - to realize the G-trisection
genus, and prove how to determine it directly from the graph itself. Moreover,
the existence of gem-induced trisections and an estimation of the G-trisection
genus via surgery description is obtained, for each compact simply-connected PL
4-manifold admitting a handle decomposition lacking in 1-handles and 3-handles.
As a consequence, we prove that the G-trisection genus equals $1$ for all
$\mathbb D^2$-bundles of $\mathbb S^2$, and hence it is not finite-to-one.

resource theory of quantum operations, here we quantify experimentally the
ability of a typical quantum-optical detector, the weak-field homodyne
detector, to detect coherence. We derive an improved algorithm for quantum
detector tomography and apply it to reconstruct the positive-operator-valued
measures (POVMs) of the detector in different configurations. The reconstructed
POVMs are then employed to evaluate how well the detector can detect coherence
using two computable measures. As the first experimental investigation of
quantum measurements from a resource theoretical perspective, our work sheds
new light on the rigorous evaluation of the performance of a quantum
measurement apparatus.

can be found in rivers, terrestrial deserts and other planetary environments.
These bedforms are characterized by a crescentic shape, which, although robust,
presents different scales according to the environment they are in, their
length scale varying from the decimeter under water to the kilometer on Mars.
In addition to the scales of bedforms, the transport of grains presents
significant differences according to the nature of the entraining fluid, so
that the growth of barchans rests to be fully understood. Given the smaller
length and time scales of the aquatic case, subaqueous barchans are the ideal
object to study the growth of barchan dunes. In the present paper, we reproduce
numerically the experiments of Alvarez and Franklin [Phys. Rev. E 96, 062906

barchans from their initiation until they have reached a stable shape. We
computed the bed evolution by using computational fluid dynamics - discrete
element method (CFD-DEM), where we coupled DEM with large eddy simulation (LES)
for the same initial and boundary conditions of experiments, performed in a
closed-conduit channel where initially conical heaps evolved to single barchans
under the action of a water flow in turbulent regime. Our simulations captured
well the evolution of the initial pile toward a barchan dune in both the
bedform and grain scales, with the same characteristic time and lengths
observed in experiments. In addition, we obtained the local granular flux and
the resultant force acting on each grain, the latter not yet previously
measured nor computed. This shows that the present method is appropriate to
numerical computations of bedforms, opening new possibilities for accessing
data that are not available from current experiments.

Quantitatively, our results state that an ensemble $M$ signals, composed of
a-priori unknown latent $R$ signals, each bandlimited to $W/2$ but only
$S$-sparse in the Fourier domain, can be reconstructed exactly from compressive
sampling only at a rate $RS\log^{\alpha} W$ samples per second. When $R \ll M$,

from a few linear measurements. The conventional convex penalties for S$\&$L

hundreds of photon orders and a spectral broadening of 700 eV. Mapping the
near-field interaction with ultrashort electron pulses in space and time, we
trace the temporal ring-down of the microresonator following a femtosecond
excitation and observe the cavity's resonant spectral response. Resonantly
enhancing the coupling of electrons and light via optical cavities, with
efficient injection and extraction, can open up novel applications such as
continuous-wave acceleration, attosecond structuring, and real-time all-optical
electron detection.

we investigate the scaling properties of EUV intensity fluctuations of

signals obtained with the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (SDO/AIA) instrument. Contemporaneous line-of-sight SDO/Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetic fields provide a context for the physical
environment. We find that the intensity fluctuations in the time series of EUV
images present at each spatial point a scaling symmetry over the range $\sim
20$ min to $\sim$ 1 hour. Thus we are able to calculate a generalized Hurst
exponent and produce image maps, not of physical quantities like intensity or
temperature, but of a single dynamical parameter that sums up the statistical
nature of the intensity fluctuations at each pixel. In quiet-Sun (QS) regions
and in coronal holes (CHs) with magnetic bipoles, the scaling exponent ($1.0 <
\alpha \leq 1.5$) corresponds to anti-correlated turbulent-like processes. In
coronal holes, and in quiet-Sun regions primarily associated with (open)
magnetic field of dominant polarity, the generalized exponent (0.5 $< \alpha <$
1) corresponds to positively-correlated (persistent) processes. We identify a
tendency for $\alpha$ $\sim$ $1$ near coronal hole boundaries and in other
regions in which open and closed magnetic fields are in proximity. This is a
signature of an underlying $1/f$ type process that is characteristic for
self-organized criticality and shot-noise models.

demonstrate that it is in fact routinely outperformed by another algorithm when
exhaustively tested across a sufficiently wide range of market scenarios. The
novel step taken here is to use large-scale compute facilities to brute-force
exhaustively evaluate AA in a variety of market environments based on those
used for testing it in the original publications. Our results show that even in
these simple environments AA is consistently out-performed by IBM's GDX
algorithm, first published in 2002. We summarize here results from more than
one million market simulation experiments, orders of magnitude more testing
than was reported in the original publications that first introduced AA. A 2019
ICAART paper by Cliff claimed that AA's failings were revealed by testing it in
more realistic experiments, with conditions closer to those found in real
financial markets, but here we demonstrate that even in the simple experiment
conditions that were used in the original AA papers, exhaustive testing shows
AA to be outperformed by GDX. We close this paper with a discussion of the
methodological implications of our work: any results from previous papers where
any one trading algorithm is claimed to be superior to others on the basis of
only a few thousand trials are probably best treated with some suspicion now.
The rise of cloud computing means that the compute-power necessary to subject
trading algorithms to millions of trials over a wide range of conditions is
readily available at reasonable cost: we should make use of this; exhaustive
testing such as is shown here should be the norm in future evaluations and
comparisons of new trading algorithms.

subject of numerous publications in the literature. Extrusion Blow Molding is a
polymer forming technique used to manufacture a wide range of large hollow
parts such as fuel tanks used in the automotive industry. The die gap is varied
during extrusion to adjust the manufactured product's final thickness and to
compensate for uneven stretching during molding. In this work, mathematical
modeling of varying die gap extrusion is introduced. Two models using different
approaches are presented to model the time dependent effects of varying the die
gap on the extrudate. In the first approach, physics based partial differential
equations are used to simulate extrusion. The Navier Stokes equations are used
as governing equations to simulate molten polymers. The governing equations are
solved using Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian based Finite Element Method. A novel
numerical method for defining the free surface of the extrudate is proposed. In
addition, the effects of varying the die gap on the material velocity, pressure
and extrudate shape are reported. In the second approach, a parameter
identification scheme is used to obtain the parameters of a novel model with a
predefined structure. The purpose of the proposed model is to replicate time

in combining the information contained in livestock mobility networks with

predicting the continuous subjective appraisal of the emotional content of
music by time-varying spectral content of EEG signals. The EEG, along with an
emotional appraisal of 15 subjects, was recorded during listening to seven
musical excerpts. The emotional appraisement was recorded along the valence and
arousal emotional axes as a continuous signal. The FPC model was composed of
parallel cascades with each cascade containing a fuzzy logic-based system. The
FPC model performance was evaluated by comparing with linear regression (LR),
support vector regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory recurrent neural
network (LSTM RNN) models. The RMSE of the FPC was lower than other models for
the estimation of both valence and arousal of all musical excerpts. The lowest
RMSE was 0.089 which was obtained in estimation of the valence of MS4 by the
FPC model. The analysis of MI of frontal EEG with the valence confirms the role
of frontal channels in theta frequency band in emotion recognition. Considering
the dynamic variations of musical features during songs, employing a modeling
approach to predict dynamic variations of the emotional appraisal can be a
plausible substitute for the classification of musical excerpts into predefined
labels.

the proposed dictionary learning using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.
Furthermore, the proposed method does not require additional preprocessing and

applications, and complex-valued representations in deep learning have
appealing theoretical properties. While these aspects have long been
recognized, complex-valued deep learning continues to lag far behind its
real-valued counterpart.
  We propose a principled geometric approach to complex-valued deep learning.
Complex-valued data could often be subject to arbitrary complex-valued scaling;
as a result, real and imaginary components could co-vary. Instead of treating
complex values as two independent channels of real values, we recognize their
underlying geometry: We model the space of complex numbers as a product
manifold of non-zero scaling and planar rotations. Arbitrary complex-valued
scaling naturally becomes a group of transitive actions on this manifold.
  We propose to extend the property instead of the form of real-valued
functions to the complex domain. We define convolution as weighted Fr\'echet
mean on the manifold that is equivariant to the group of scaling/rotation
actions, and define distance transform on the manifold that is invariant to the
action group. The manifold perspective also allows us to define nonlinear
activation functions such as tangent ReLU and G-transport, as well as residual
connections on the manifold-valued data.
  We dub our model SurReal, as our experiments on MSTAR and RadioML deliver
high performance with only a fractional size of real-valued and complex-valued
baseline models.

concern or security purpose.

continuous third-order hyperbolic sine chaotic system was proposed by Z. Lin et
al. The cryptosystem's main objective is to provide a faster algorithm with
lowest computational time in order to be qualified for use in embedded systems
especially on a program of UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle). In this paper, we
scrutinize the design architecture of this recently proposed scheme against
conventional attacks e.g., chosen plaintext attack, differential attack, known
plaintext attack. We prove in this paper that, negatively, the studied system
is vulnerable. For differential attack, only two chosen plain images are
required to recover the full equivalent key. Moreover, only one 3x400 size
image is sufficient to break the cryptosystem under chosen plaintext attack
considering stability of sort algorithm. Therefore, the proposed scheme is not
recommended for security purposes.

  self-supervision","Presented at ICLR 2019 Limited Labeled Data (LLD) Workshop",,,,"eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While deep learning has been incredibly successful in modeling tasks with
large, carefully curated labeled datasets, its application to problems with
limited labeled data remains a challenge. The aim of the present work is to
improve the label efficiency of large neural networks operating on audio data
through a combination of multitask learning and self-supervised learning on
unlabeled data. We trained an end-to-end audio feature extractor based on
WaveNet that feeds into simple, yet versatile task-specific neural networks. We
describe several easily implemented self-supervised learning tasks that can
operate on any large, unlabeled audio corpus. We demonstrate that, in scenarios
with limited labeled training data, one can significantly improve the
performance of three different supervised classification tasks individually by
up to 6% through simultaneous training with these additional self-supervised
tasks. We also show that incorporating data augmentation into our multitask
setting leads to even further gains in performance.

development more effective. In this paper, we report an analysis of the
organization and interconnection between two important issues in chemistry,
namely mass spectrometry (MS) and capillary electrophoresis (CE). For that
purpose, we employed science of science techniques based on complex networks.
More specifically, we considered a citation network in which the nodes and
connections represent papers and citations, respectively. Interesting results
were found, including a good separation between some clusters of articles
devoted to instrumentation techniques and applications. However, the papers
that describe CE-MS did not lead to a well-defined cluster. In order to better
understand the organization of the citation network, we considered a
multi-scale analysis, in which we used the information regarding sub-clusters.
Firstly, we analyzed the sub-cluster of the first article devoted to the
coupling between CE and MS, which was found to be a good representation of its
sub-cluster. The second analysis was about the sub-cluster of a seminal paper
known to be the first that dealt with proteins by using CE-MS. By considering
the proposed methodologies, our paper paves the way for researchers working
with both techniques, since it elucidates the knowledge organization and can
therefore lead to better literature reviews.

high-efficiency fiber-to-chip interface is key to the use of these integrated
photonic circuits for quantum information tasks, as photon loss is a major
source that weakens quantum protocols. Here, overcoming material and
fabrication limitation of thin-film aluminum nitride by adopting a stepwise
waveguiding scheme, we demonstrate low-loss adiabatic fiber-optic couplers in
aluminum nitride films with a substantial thickness (600 nm) for optimized
nonlinear photon interaction. For telecom (1550 nm) and near-visible (780 nm)
transverse magnetic-polarized light, the measured insertion loss of the
fiber-optic coupler is -0.97 dB and -2.6 dB, respectively. Our results will
facilitate the use of aluminum nitride integrated photonic circuits as
efficient quantum resources for generation of entangled photons and squeezed
light on microchips.

  Actuator",,,,,"physics.app-ph q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ionic Polymer Metal Composite is a well-known soft electroactive polymer
composite that it's promising features tell us that it has adequate potential
to be a utilizable and applicative soft actuator in the practical applications,
especially in the small size applications. But this smart material is still
immature, and one of the reasons that lead to its immaturity is lack of a valid
and proper physics-based model for large deformation situations. In practical
online and large deformation applications, the inverse non-autoregressive
identification based models are the proper choices but if we want to know how
IPMC works and what is the physics of its behavior in the large deformation
situation the inverse identification based models are deeply blind, and we have
to use physical and multi-physical approaches. It is our main aim in this
paper, and for the first time, we want to present a fully analytical and
physics-based ion transport 3D and non-Linear model for large deformable IPMC.
In this direction, based on three dimensional Nernst-Plank PDE we will find a
well-defined and valid relationship between input voltage and output tip
displacement of IPMC for large deformation situation and with four provable
pieces of evidence it will be proven that proposed model has chosen a proper
way and it is more complete than previous benchmark and well-known
physics-based models for IPMC, and also it is valid and accurate enough for
large deformation modeling of IPMC.
