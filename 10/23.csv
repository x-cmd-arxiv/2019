Lidskii formula for the volume of a flow polytope was developed by Benedetti et
al.. This converts the problem of computing Kostant partition functions into a
problem of enumerating a set of objects called unified diagrams. We devise an
enhanced version of this combinatorial model to compute the volumes of flow
polytopes defined on a family of graphs called the k-caracol graphs, resulting
in the first application of the model to non-planar graphs. At k=1 and k=n-1,
we recover results for the classical caracol graph and the Pitman--Stanley
graph. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of in-degree gravity diagrams for
flow polytopes, which are equinumerous with (out-degree) gravity diagrams
considered by Benedetti et al.. We show that for the k-caracol flow polytopes,
these two kinds of gravity diagrams satisfy a natural combinatorial
correspondence, which raises an intriguing question on the relationship in the
geometry of two related polytopes.

commercial, scientific and medical domains today. Data skew is a ubiquitous
feature of these real-world domains. In a retail database, some products are
typically much more popular than others. In a text database, word frequencies
follow a Zipf distribution with a small number of very common words, and a long
tail of infrequent words. In a geographic database, some regions have much
higher populations (and data measurements) than others. Current systems do not
make the most of caches for exploiting skew. In particular, a whole cache line
may remain cache resident even though only a small part of the cache line
corresponds to a popular data item. In this paper, we propose a novel index
structure for repositioning data items to concentrate popular items into the
same cache lines. The net result is better spatial locality, and better
utilization of limited cache resources. We develop a theoretical model for
analyzing the cache behavior, and implement database operators that are
efficient in the presence of skew. Our experiments on real and synthetic data
show that exploiting skew can significantly improve in-memory query
performance. In some cases, our techniques can speed up queries by over an
order of magnitude.

protection over traditional recommender systems that are centralized at a data

consider the limitations of storage, RAM, energy and communication bandwidth in
a mobile environment. The scales of the models proposed are too large to be
easily run on mobile devices. And existing federated recommender systems need
to fine-tune recommendation models on each device, making it hard to
effectively exploit collaborative filtering information among users/devices.
Our goal in this paper is to design a novel federated learning framework for
rating prediction (RP) for mobile environments. We introduce a federated matrix
factorization (MF) framework, named meta matrix factorization (MetaMF). Given a
user, we first obtain a collaborative vector by collecting useful information
with a collaborative memory module. Then, we employ a meta recommender module
to generate private item embeddings and a RP model based on the collaborative
vector in the server. To address the challenge of generating a large number of
high-dimensional item embeddings, we devise a rise-dimensional generation
strategy that first generates a low-dimensional item embedding matrix and a
rise-dimensional matrix, and then multiply them to obtain high-dimensional
embeddings. We use the generated model to produce private RPs for the given
user on her device. MetaMF shows a high capacity even with a small RP model,
which can adapt to the limitations of a mobile environment. We conduct
extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets to compare MetaMF with
existing MF methods and find that MetaMF can achieve competitive performance.
Moreover, we find MetaMF achieves higher RP performance over existing federated
methods by better exploiting collaborative filtering among users/devices.

effective area 2-3 times larger. Building on IXPE results, eXTP will increase
the number of sources for which significant polarimetric measurements could be
obtained. However, further progresses, such as exploring a broader energy
range, considering a larger effective area, improving the angular resolution,
and performing wide-field polarization measurements, are needed to reach a
mature phase for X-ray polarimetry. In the first part of this White Paper we
will discuss a few scientific cases in which a next generation X-ray
Polarimetry mission can provide significant advances. In the second part, a
possible concept for a medium-class Next Generation X-ray Polarimetry (NGXP)
mission will be sketched.

and recently introduced variants with variance-reduction techniques in imaging
inverse problems. Such algorithms have been shown in the machine learning
literature to have optimal complexities in theory, and provide great
improvement empirically over the deterministic gradient methods. Surprisingly,
in some tasks such as image deblurring, many of such methods fail to converge
faster than the accelerated deterministic gradient methods, even in terms of
epoch counts. We investigate this phenomenon and propose a theory-inspired
mechanism for the practitioners to efficiently characterize whether it is
beneficial for an inverse problem to be solved by stochastic optimization
techniques or not. Using standard tools in numerical linear algebra, we derive
conditions on the spectral structure of the inverse problem for being a
suitable application of stochastic gradient methods. Particularly, we show
that, for an imaging inverse problem, if and only if its Hessain matrix has a
fast-decaying eigenspectrum, then the stochastic gradient methods can be more
advantageous than deterministic methods for solving such a problem. Our results
also provide guidance on choosing appropriately the partition minibatch
schemes, showing that a good minibatch scheme typically has relatively low
correlation within each of the minibatches. Finally, we propose an accelerated
primal-dual SGD algorithm in order to tackle another key bottleneck of
stochastic optimization which is the heavy computation of proximal operators.
The proposed method has fast convergence rate in practice, and is able to
efficiently handle non-smooth regularization terms which are coupled with
linear operators.

(1) they are almost as efficient as the best existing tests when the
associations are homogeneous across quantile levels, and have improved
efficiency for complex and heterogeneous associations, (2) they provide useful

structure underlying the signals. We thus present a novel method for combining
the multiple graphs into a global graph using mask matrices, which are
estimated through an optimization problem that accommodates the multi-layer
graph information and a signal representation model. The proposed mask
combination method also estimates the contribution of each graph layer in the
structure of signals. The experiments conducted both on synthetic and
real-world data suggest that integrating the multi-layer graph representation
of the data in the structure inference framework enhances the learning
procedure considerably by adapting to the quality and the quantity of the input
data.

target node $v^\star$ with the least number of distance queries possible. In
the $j^{th}$ step of the game, the player queries a single node $v_j$ and
receives, as an answer to their query, the distance between the nodes $v_j$ and
$v^\star$. The sequential metric dimension (SMD) is the minimal number of
queries that the player needs to guess the target with absolute certainty, no
matter where the target is.
  The term SMD originates from the related notion of metric dimension (MD),
which can be defined the same way as the SMD, except that the player's queries
are non-adaptive. In this work, we extend the results of
\cite{bollobas2012metric} on the MD of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs to the SMD. We
find that, in connected Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, the MD and the SMD are a
constant factor apart. For the lower bound we present a clean analysis by
combining tools developed for the MD and a novel coupling argument. For the
upper bound we show that a strategy that greedily minimizes the number of
candidate targets in each step uses asymptotically optimal queries in
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. Connections with source localization, binary search

implementing large-scale quantum computing. To read the spin state of these
qubits, the mechanism that has provided the highest fidelity is spin-to-charge
conversion via singlet-triplet spin blockade, which can be detected in-situ
using gate-based dispersive sensing. In systems with a complex energy spectrum,
like silicon quantum dots, accurately identifying when singlet-triplet blockade
occurs is hence of major importance for scalable qubit readout. In this work,

gate-based magnetospectroscopy, we report successive steps of spin blockade and
spin blockade lifting involving spin states with total spin angular momentum up
to $S=3$. More particularly, we report the formation of a hybridized spin
quintet state and show triplet-quintet and quintet-septet spin blockade. This
enables studies of the quintet relaxation dynamics from which we find $T_1 \sim
4 ~\mu s$. Finally, we develop a quantum capacitance model that can be applied
generally to reconstruct the energy spectrum of a double quantum dot including
the spin-dependent tunnel couplings and the energy splitting between different

how the extended Wigner's friend argument fails in the ensemble interpretation.
It also makes more evident how natural a consistent statistical treatment of

bringing out the core statistical nature of QM. It, in addition, manifests the
unnecessary complications and problems introduced by the collapse mechanism
that is part of the Copenhagen interpretation. The paper uses the
straightforwardness of the ensemble interpretation to make the no-go argument

One of the major factors that affect the secure key rate in free-space MDI-QKD
is atmospheric turbulence. In this work we show two important results: First,
the independent fluctuations of transmittances in the two channels can
significantly reduce MDI-QKD performance due to turbulence-induced channel
asymmetry. Second, we consider the Prefixed Real-Time Selection (P-RTS) method
we formerly introduced to BB84 and extend it to MDI-QKD. Users can monitor
classical transmittances in their channels and improve performance by
post-selecting signals in real-time based on pre-calculated thresholds. We show
that we can establish a 2-dimensional threshold between Alice and Bob to
post-select signals with both high signal-to-noise ratio and low channel
asymmetry in real time, and greatly extend the maximum range of MDI-QKD in the
presence of turbulence, which can be an important step towards future

the lane-changing model in urban driving scenarios. We define human incentives
from different perspectives, speed incentive, route change incentive, comfort
incentive and courtesy incentive etc. We applied a decision-theoretical tool,
called Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to take these incentive policies
into account. The strategy of combination is according to different driving
style which varies for each driving. Thus a lane-changing decision selection
algorithm is proposed. Not only our method allows for varying the motivation of
lane-changing from the purely egoistic desire to a more courtesy concern, but
also they can mimic drivers' state, inattentive or concentrate, which
influences their driving Behaviour. We define some cost functions and calibrate
the parameters with different scenarios of traffic data. Distinguishing driving
styles are used to aggregate decision-makers' assessments about various
criteria weightings to obtain the action drivers desire most. Our result
demonstrates the proposed method can produce varied lane-changing behaviour.
Unlike other lane-changing models based on artificial intelligence methods, our

development and cycle-to-cycle variations (CCV) in spark ignition (SI) engines
was provided long ago, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of
early flame/turbulence interactions, and accurate models for full engine
simulations do not exist. Since the flame kernel is initiated with small size,
i.e. with large positive curvature, differential diffusion is expected to
severely alter early flame growth in non-unity-Lewis-number
(${\mathrm{Le}\neq1}$) mixtures as typically used in engines. In this work, a
DNS database of developing iso-octane/air flame kernels and planar flames has
been established with flame conditions representative for stoichiometric engine
part-load operation. Differential diffusion effects on the global heat release
rate are analyzed by relating the present findings to equivalent flames
computed in the ${\mathrm{Le}=1}$ limit. It is shown that in the early kernel
development phase, the normal propagation velocity is significantly reduced
with detrimental consequences on the global burning rate of the flame kernel.
Besides this impact on the overall mass burning rate, the initial production of
flame surface area by the normal propagation term in the flame area balance
equation is noticeably reduced. By using the optimal estimator concept, it is
shown that strong fluctuations in local heat release rate inherent to
${\mathrm{Le}\neq1}$ flames in the thin reaction zones regime are mainly
contained in the parameters local equivalence ratio, enthalpy, and H-radical
mass fraction. Differential diffusion couples the evolution of these parameters
to the unsteady flame geometry and structure, which is analyzed in Part II of
the present study (Falkenstein et al., Combust. Flame, 2019).

slow-down of early flame kernel development caused by the
($\mathrm{Le}>1$)-property of common transportation-fuel/air mixtures tends to
increase cycle-to-cycle variations (CCV). To improve the fundamental
understanding of the complex phenomena inside the flame structure of developing
flame kernels, an engine-relevant DNS database is investigated in this work.
Conclusive analyses are enabled by considering equivalent flame kernels and
turbulent planar flames computed with $\mathrm{Le}>1$ and $\mathrm{Le}=1$. In
Part I of the present study (Falkenstein et al., Combust. Flame, 2019), a
reduced representation of the local mixture state based on the parameters local
enthalpy, local equivalence ratio, and H-radical mass fraction was proposed for
the purpose of this analysis. Here, a coupling relation for the
diffusion-controlled mixture parameter local enthalpy with local flame geometry
and structure is derived, characterized by the key parameters $\kappa$ and ${\
|\nabla c \ t|/\ |\nabla c \ |_{\mathrm{lam}}}$. The analysis shows that the
large positive global mean curvature intrinsic to the flame kernel
configuration may detrimentally affect the local mixture state inside the
reaction zone, particularly during the initial kernel development phase.
External energy supply by spark ignition may effectively bridge over this
critical stage, which causes the impact of global mean flame kernel curvature
to be small under the present conditions compared to the overall effect of
$\mathrm{Le}\neq1$. Once ignition effects have decayed, the mixture state
inside the reaction zone locally exhibits an identical dependence on $\ |\nabla
c \ |$ as in a strained laminar flame. This implies that differential diffusion
effects under engine-typical Karlovitz numbers are not weakened by small-scale
turbulent mixing.

In this work we study the cosmological information content of the next order
term which combines the tSZ and kSZ effects, hereafter called the

same velocity dependence as the kSZ effect, it will also have many of the
useful properties of the kSZ effect. However, it also has its own, unique
spectral dependence, which allows it to be isolated from all other CMB signals.
We show that with currently-envisioned CMB missions the tkSZ effect can be
detected and can be used to reconstruct large scale velocity fields, with no
appreciable bias from either the kSZ effect or other extragalactic foregrounds.
Furthermore, since the relativistic corrections arise from the well-studied
pressure of ionized gas, rather than the gas number density as in the kSZ
effect, the degeneracy due to uncertain gas physics will be significantly
reduced. Finally, for a very low-noise experiment the tkSZ effect will be
measurable at higher precision than the kSZ.

confirm that stream-stream collisions caused by relativistic apsidal precession
rapidly circularise the disrupted material into a disc. For inclined
trajectories we find that nodal precession induced by the black hole spin (i.e.
Lense-Thirring precession) inhibits stream-stream collisions only in the first
orbit, merely causing a short delay in forming a disc, which is inclined to the
black hole equatorial plane. We also investigate the effect of radiative
cooling on the remnant disc structure. We find that with no cooling a thick,
extended, slowly precessing torus is formed, with a radial extent of 5 au (for
orbits with a high penetration factor). Radiatively efficient cooling produces
a narrow, rapidly precessing ring close to pericentre. We plot the energy
dissipation rate, which tracks the pancake shock, stream-stream collisions and
viscosity. We compare this to the effective luminosity due to accretion onto

source requires a bright-end slope $\beta \geq 3.7$ for the intrinsic quasar
luminosity function, $\Phi(L) \propto L^{-\beta}$. Commonly used values of
$\beta \sim 2.8$ are rejected at $>3\sigma$. If the claim is confirmed, it is
very unlikely that all the remaining $51$ sources in the SDSS sample are not
magnified. Furthermore, it suffices that $\gtrsim 25\%$ of the remaining
sources are lensed for the intrinsic luminosity function to differ
significantly (i.e., $>3\sigma$) from the observed one. The presence of
additional extremely magnified sources in the sample would lower the
requirement to $\sim 4\%$. Our results urge the community to perform more
extended multi-wavelength searches targeting $z>6$ lensed quasars, also among
known samples. This effort could vitally contribute to solving the open problem
of the growth of the brightest $z\sim 7$ quasars.

increase in frequency by two orders of magnitude. Lens-modelling techniques are
being developed to prepare for the coming massive influx of new lens data, and
blind tests of lens reconstruction with simulated data are needed for
validation. In this paper we present a systematic blind study of a sample of 15
simulated strong gravitational lenses from the EAGLE suite of hydrodynamic
simulations. We model these lenses with a free-form technique and evaluate
reconstructed mass distributions using criteria based on shape, orientation,
and lensed image reconstruction. Especially useful is a lensing analogue of the
Roche potential in binary star systems, which we call the $\textit{lensing
Roche potential}$. This we introduce in order to factor out the well-known
problem of steepness or mass-sheet degeneracy. Einstein radii are on average
well recovered with a relative error of ${\sim}5\%$ for quads and ${\sim}25\%$
for doubles; the position angle of ellipticity is on average also reproduced
well up to $\pm10^{\circ}$, but the reconstructed mass maps tend to be too
round and too shallow. It is also easy to reproduce the lensed images, but
optimising on this criterion does not guarantee better reconstruction of the
mass distribution.

galaxy with no significant ongoing star formation, consistent with the lack of
rest-frame UV flux and overall photometric spectral energy distribution. With a
stellar mass of $3.1^{+0.1}_{-0.2} \times 10^{11} ~\rm{M}_\odot$ at $z =

The star-formation history of this quiescent galaxy implies that it formed
$>1000 ~\rm{M}_\odot$/yr for almost 0.5 Gyr beginning at $z\sim7.2$, strongly
suggestive that it is the descendant of massive dusty star-forming galaxies at
$5<z<7$ recently observed with ALMA. While galaxies with similarly extreme
stellar masses are reproduced in some simulations at early times, such a lack
of ongoing star formation is not seen there. This suggests the need for a more

provided by chemical evolution models constructed to reproduce the Na-O

better constraint might be attained for star formation history and chemical

increase over the generation, and therefore, the various extensions observed in

this observed diversity, however, would not be naturally explained by the

converges, albeit not necessarily rapidly, with respect to excitation number.
We show that, if the coefficients of Slater determinants (SD) with $l\leq k$
excitations can be defined with a number of free parameters $N_{\leq k}$
bounded polynomially in $k$, the ground state energy $E$ only depends on a
small fraction of all the wave function parameters, and is the solution of
equations of the coupled-cluster (CC) form. This generalizes the standard CC
method, for which $N_{\leq k}$ is bounded by a constant. Based on that result
and low-rank tensor decompositions (LRTD), we discuss two possible extensions
of the CC approach for wave functions with general polynomial bound for
$N_{\leq k}$. First, one can use LRTD to represent the amplitudes of the CC
cluster operator $T$ which, unlike in the CC case, is not truncated with
respect to excitation number, and the energy and tensor parameters are given by
a LRTD-adapted version of standard CC equations. Second, the LRTD can also be
used to directly parametrize the CI coefficients, which involves different
equations of the CC form. We derive those equations for up to
quadruple-excitation coefficients, using a different type of excitation
operator in the CC wave function ansatz, and a Hamiltonian representation in
terms of excited particle and hole operators. We complete the proposed CC
extensions by constructing compact tensor representations of coefficients, or
$T$-amplitudes, using superpositions of tree tensor networks which take into
account different possible types of entanglement between excited particles and
holes. Finally, we discuss why the proposed extensions are theoretically
applicable at larger coupling strengths than those treatable by the standard CC

Phases of matter are classified
by symmetry breaking, topological phases are characterized by non-local
symmetries, and point group symmetries are critical to our understanding of
crystalline materials. Symmetries could then be used as a criterion to engineer
quantum systems with targeted properties. Toward that end, we have developed a
novel approach, the symmetric Hamiltonian construction (SHC), that takes as
input symmetries, specified by integrals of motion or discrete symmetry
transformations, and produces as output all local Hamiltonians consistent with
these symmetries (see github.com/ClarkResearchGroup/qosy for our open-source
code). This approach builds on the slow operator method [PRE 92, 012128]. We
use our new approach to construct new Hamiltonians for topological phases of
matter.
  Topological phases of matter are exotic quantum phases with potential
applications in quantum computation. In this work, we focus on two types of
topological phases of matter: superconductors with Majorana zero modes and
$Z_2$ quantum spin liquids. In our first application of the SHC approach, we
analytically construct a large and highly tunable class of superconducting
Hamiltonians with Majorana zero modes with a given targeted spatial
distribution. This result lays the foundation for potential new experimental
routes to realizing Majorana fermions. In our second application, we find new
$Z_2$ spin liquid Hamiltonians on the square and kagome lattices. These new
Hamiltonians are not sums of commuting operators nor frustration-free and, when
perturbed appropriately (in a way that preserves their $Z_2$ spin liquid
behavior), exhibit level-spacing statistics that suggest non-integrability.
This result demonstrates how our approach can automatically generate new spin
liquid Hamiltonians with interesting properties not often seen in solvable
models.

Current models of Galactic CRs that consider supernovae (SNe) shocks as the
main sites of particle acceleration cannot satisfactorily explain the higher
${\rm ^{22}Ne/^{20}Ne}$ ratio in CRs compared to the interstellar medium.
Although stellar winds from massive stars have been invoked, their contribution
relative to SNe ejecta has been taken as a free parameter. Here we present a
theoretical calculation of the relative contributions of wind termination
shocks (WTSs) and SNe shocks in superbubbles, based on the hydrodynamics of
winds in clusters, the standard stellar mass function, and stellar evolution
theory. We find that the contribution of WTSs towards the total CR production
is at least $25\%$, which rises to $\gtrsim 50\%$ for young ($\lesssim 10$ Myr)
clusters, and explains the observed $^{22}{\rm Ne}/^{20} {\rm Ne}$ ratio. We
argue that since the progenitors of apparently isolated supernovae remnants
(SNRs) are born in massive star clusters, both WTS and SNe shocks can be
integrated into a combined scenario of CRs being accelerated in massive
clusters. This scenario is consistent with the observed ratio of SNRs to
$\gamma$-ray bright ($L_\gamma \gtrsim 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$) star clusters, as
predicted by star cluster mass function. Moreover, WTSs can accelerate CRs to
PeV energies, and solve other longstanding problems of the standard supernova
paradigm of CR acceleration.

($e=0.53_{-0.13}^{+0.09}$) orbit at an intermediate inclination

the complex shape of the multidimensional posterior distribution. We find a
semi-major axis of $11.1_{-1.3}^{+4.2}$\,au and a period of
$28.1_{-4.9}^{+17.2}$\,yr, assuming a mass of 1.75\,M$_{\odot}$ for the host
star. We find consistent values with a recent analysis of VLT/SPHERE data
covering a similar baseline. We investigated the potential of using absolute
astrometry of the host star to obtain a dynamical mass constraint for the
planet. The astrometric acceleration of 51~Eri derived from a comparison of the
{\it Hipparcos} and {\it Gaia} catalogues was found to be inconsistent at the
2--3$\sigma$ level with the predicted reflex motion induced by the orbiting
planet. Potential sources of this inconsistency include a combination of random
and systematic errors between the two astrometric catalogs or the signature of
an additional companion within the system interior to current detection limits.
We also explored the potential of using {\it Gaia} astrometry alone for a
dynamical mass measurement of the planet by simulating {\it Gaia} measurements
of the motion of the photocenter of the system over the course of the extended
eight-year mission. We find that such a measurement is only possible ($>98$\%

remnants on the cosmological 21-cm global signal. By combining a semi-analytic
model of Pop III star formation with a global 21-cm simulation code, we
investigate how X-ray and radio emission from accreting Pop III black holes may
affect both the timing and depth of the 21-cm absorption feature that follows
the initial onset of star formation during the Cosmic Dawn. We compare our
results to the findings of the EDGES experiment, which has reported the first
detection of a cosmic 21-cm signal. In general, we find that our fiducial Pop
III models, which have peak star formation rate densities of $\sim 10^{-4}$
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ between $z \sim 10$ and $z \sim 15$, are able to
match the timing of the EDGES signal quite well, in contrast to models that
ignore Pop III stars. To match the unexpectedly large depth of the EDGES signal
without recourse to exotic physics, we vary the parameters of emission from
accreting black holes (formed as Pop III remnants) including the intrinsic
strength of X-ray and radio emission as well as the local column density of
neutral gas. We find that models with strong radio emission and relatively weak
X-ray emission can self-consistently match the EDGES signal, though this
solution requires fine-tuning. We are only able to produce signals with sharp
features similar to the EDGES signal if the Pop~III IMF is peaked narrowly
around $140 \, M_\odot$.

low-amplitude accelerations of nearby early-type stars measured from a
comparison of the {\it Hipparcos} and {\it Gaia} astrometric catalogues. This
signal is consistent with either a stellar companion with a moderate mass ratio
($q\sim0.5$) on a short period ($P<1$\,yr), or a substellar companion at a
separation wide enough to be resolved with ground-based high contrast imaging
instruments; long-period equal mass ratio stellar companions that are also
consistent with the measured acceleration are excluded with previous imaging
observations. The small but significant amplitude of the acceleration made HR
1645 a promising candidate for targeted searches for brown dwarf and
planetary-mass companions around nearby, young stars. In this paper we explore
the origin of the astrometric acceleration by modelling the signal induced by a
wide-orbit M8 companion discovered with the Gemini Planet Imager, as well as
the effects of an inner short-period spectroscopic companion discovered a
century ago but not since followed-up. We present the first constraints on the
orbit of the inner companion, and demonstrate that it is a plausible cause of
the astrometric acceleration. This result demonstrates the importance of
vetting of targets with measured astrometric acceleration for short-period
stellar companions prior to conducting targeted direct imaging surveys for
wide-orbit substellar companions.

takes a causal discovery algorithm that can only distinguish purely directed
causal relations and modifies it to also detect latent common causes. We apply
our method to two directed causal discovery algorithms, the Information

observed with sufficient sensitivity. The masses of these black holes are
observed to increase with either the total mass or the mean (random) velocity
of the stars in their host galaxies. The origin of these correlations remains
elusive. Observational systematics and biases severely limit our knowledge of
the local demography of supermassive black holes thus preventing accurate model
comparisons and progress in this field. Here we show that the large-scale
spatial distribution of local active galactic nuclei (AGN), believed to be
accreting supermassive black holes, can constrain the shape and normalization
of the black hole-stellar mass relation thus bypassing resolution-related
observational biases. In turn, our results can set more stringent constraints
on the so-called ""radiative efficiency"", a fundamental parameter describing the
inner physics of supermassive black holes that is closely linked to their spin,
geometry, and ability to release energy. The mean value of the radiative
efficiency can be estimated by comparing the average total luminous output of
AGN with the relic mass density locked up in quiescent supermassive black holes
at galaxy centres today. For currently accepted values of the AGN obscured
fractions and bolometric corrections, our newest estimates of the local
supermassive black hole mass density favour mean radiative efficiencies of
~10-20\%, suggesting that the vast majority of supermassive black holes are
spinning moderately to rapidly. With large-scale AGN surveys coming online, our
novel methodology will enable even tighter constraints on the fundamental
parameters that regulate the growth of supermassive black holes.

new estimate of the time-varying angular momentum flux in the equatorial solar
wind, as observed by the \textit{Wind} spacecraft from 1994-2019. We separate
the angular momentum flux into contributions from the protons, alpha particles,
and magnetic stresses, showing that the mechanical flux in the protons is
$\sim$3 times larger than the magnetic field stresses. We observe the tendency
for the angular momentum flux of fast wind streams to be oppositely signed to
the slow wind streams, as noted by previous authors. From the average total
flux, we estimate the global angular momentum loss rate of the Sun to be
$3.3\times10^{30}$erg, which lies within the range of various MHD wind models
in the literature. This angular momentum loss rate is a factor of $\sim$2
weaker than required for a Skumanich-like rotation period evolution

position and orientation of acetabular bone fragments in 3D space is difficult.
We propose a computer assisted approach that uses a single fluoroscopic view
and quickly reports the pose of an acetabular fragment without any user input
or initialization. Intraoperatively, but prior to any osteotomies, two
constellations of metallic ball-bearings (BBs) are injected into the wing of a
patient's ilium and lateral superior pubic ramus. One constellation is located
on the expected acetabular fragment, and the other is located on the remaining,
larger, pelvis fragment. The 3D locations of each BB are reconstructed using
three fluoroscopic views and 2D/3D registrations to a preoperative CT scan of
the pelvis. The relative pose of the fragment is established by estimating the
movement of the two BB constellations using a single fluoroscopic view taken
after osteotomy and fragment relocation. BB detection and inter-view
correspondences are automatically computed throughout the processing pipeline.
The proposed method was evaluated on a multitude of fluoroscopic images
collected from six cadaveric surgeries performed bilaterally on three
specimens. Mean fragment rotation error was 2.4 +/- 1.0 degrees, mean
translation error was 2.1 +/- 0.6 mm, and mean 3D lateral center edge angle
error was 1.0 +/- 0.5 degrees. The average runtime of the single-view pose
estimation was 0.7 +/- 0.2 seconds. The proposed method demonstrates accuracy
similar to other state of the art systems which require optical tracking
systems or multiple-view 2D/3D registrations with manual input. The errors
reported on fragment poses and lateral center edge angles are within the
margins required for accurate intraoperative evaluation of femoral head
coverage.

relaxation, x-ray diffraction, and nanoscale-resolved near-field infrared

of the thermal evolution of the magnetic, structural, and electronic phase
transitions occurring in a wide temperature range, including quantitative
measurements of the high- and low-temperature phase fractions for each

electronic, magnetic, and structural degrees of freedom remain tightly coupled
to each other during the transition process. We also find evidence for
antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the vicinity of the phase transition,
highlighting the important role of the magnetic degree of freedom in the
metal-insulator transition.

every group above is equal to its relative commensurator in $Out(F_N)$; it also
implies that all subgroups in the Andreadakis--Johnson filtration are

Here, we present a combined experimental and theoretical study of TE properties
of Na$_{0.74}$CoO$_{2}$ compound in high-temperature region. The experimental
Seebeck coefficient (S) is found to vary from 64 to 118 $\mu$V/K in the
temperature range $300-620$ K. The positive values of S are indicating the
dominating p-type behaviour of the compound. The observed value of thermal
conductivity ($\kappa$) is $\sim$ 2.2 W/m-K at 300 K. In the temperature region
$300-430$ K, the value of $\kappa$ increases up to $\sim$ 2.6 W/m-K and then
decreases slowly till 620 K with the corresponding value of $\sim$ 2.4 W/m-K.
We have also carried out the theoretical calculations and the best matching
between experimental and calculated values of transport properties are observed
in spin-polarized calculation within DFT+\textit{U} by chosen \textit{U} = 4
eV. The maximum calculated value of ZT is found to be $\sim$ 0.67 at 1200 K for
p-type conduction. Our computational study suggests that the possibility of
n-type behaviour of the compound which can lead to a large value of ZT at
higher temperature region. Electron doping of $\sim$ 5.1$\times$10$^{20}$
cm$^{-3}$ is expected to give rise the high ZT value of $\sim$ 2.7 at 1200 K.
Using these temperature-dependent ZT values, we have calculated the maximum
possible values of efficiency ($\eta$) of thermoelectric generator (TEG) made
by p and n-type Na$_{0.74}$CoO$_{2}$. The present study suggests that one can
get the efficiency of a TE cell as high as $\sim$ 11$\%$ when the cold and hot
end temperature are fixed at 300 K and 1200 K, respectively. Such high values
of ZT and efficiency suggest that Na$_{0.74}$CoO$_{2}$ can be used as a
potential candidate for high-temperature TE applications.

shows a ring of glowing plasma with a dark patch at the centre, which is
interpreted as the shadow of the black hole. This breakthrough result, which
represents a powerful confirmation of Einstein's theory of gravity, or general
relativity, was made possible by assembling a global network of radio
telescopes operating at millimetre wavelengths that for the first time included
the Atacama Large Millimeter/ submillimeter Array (ALMA). The addition of ALMA
as an anchor station has enabled a giant leap forward by increasing the
sensitivity limits of the EHT by an order of magnitude, effectively turning it
into an imaging array. The published image demonstrates that it is now possible
to directly study the event horizon shadows of SMBHs via electromagnetic
radiation, thereby transforming this elusive frontier from a mathematical
concept into an astrophysical reality. The expansion of the array over the next
few years will include new stations on different continents - and eventually
satellites in space. This will provide progressively sharper and
higher-fidelity images of SMBH candidates, and potentially even movies of the
hot plasma orbiting around SMBHs. These improvements will shed light on the
processes of black hole accretion and jet formation on event-horizon scales,
thereby enabling more precise tests of general relativity in the truly strong

  Learning with Adversarial Critics",,,,,"cs.RO cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Controlling a biped robot to walk stably is a challenging task considering
its nonlinearity and hybrid dynamics. Reinforcement learning can address these
issues by directly mapping the observed states to optimal actions that maximize
the cumulative reward. However, the local minima caused by unsuitable rewards
and the overestimation of the cumulative reward impede the maximization of the
cumulative reward. To increase the cumulative reward, this paper designs a gait
reward based on walking principles, which compensates the local minima for
unnatural motions. Besides, an Adversarial Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic
(ATD3) policy gradient algorithm with a recurrent neural network (RNN) is
proposed to further boost the cumulative reward by mitigating the
overestimation of the cumulative reward. Experimental results in the Roboschool
Walker2d and Webots Atlas simulators indicate that the test rewards increase by
23.50% and 9.63% after adding the gait reward. The test rewards further
increase by 15.96% and 12.68% after using the ATD3_RNN, and the reason may be
that the ATD3_RNN decreases the error of estimating cumulative reward from
19.86% to 3.35%. Besides, the cosine kinetic similarity between the human and
the biped robot trained by the gait reward and ATD3_RNN increases by over
69.23%. Consequently, the designed gait reward and ATD3_RNN boost the
cumulative reward and teach biped robots to walk better.

framework which explores the use of data-driven anomaly detection methods in

transition based on a bifurcation analysis of the corresponding mode-coupling
theory equations. A schematic model is presented first, that allows analytical
progress, and the full physical model is studied numerically next. This
analysis yields a continuous type A transition with a critical power law decay
of the probe correlation functions with exponent $-1/2$. In order to compare
with simulations with a limited duration, a finite time analysis is performed,
which yields reasonable results for not-too-small wave vectors. The
theoretically predicted findings are verified by Langevin dynamics simulations.
For small wave vectors we find anomalous behavior for the probe position
correlation function, which can be traced back to a wave vector divergence of
the critical amplitude. In addition we propose and test three methods to
extract the critical force from experimental data, which provide the same value
of the critical force when applied to the finite-time theory or simulations.

Cdc42 in a mass-conserved membrane-bulk model, and explore the effects of
diffusion and spatial dimensionality on spatio-temporal pattern formation. We
first analyze a 1-D model for Cdc42 oscillations in fission yeast, consisting
of two diffusion equations in the bulk domain coupled to nonlinear ODEs for
binding kinetics at each end of the cell. In 1-D, our analysis reveals the
existence of symmetric and asymmetric steady states, as well as anti-phase
relaxation oscillations typical of slow-fast systems. We then extend our
analysis to a 2-D model with circular bulk geometry, for which species can
either diffuse inside the cell or become bound to the membrane and undergo a
nonlinear reaction-diffusion process. We also consider a nonlocal system of
PDEs approximating the dynamics of the 2-D membrane-bulk model in the limit of
fast bulk diffusion. In all three model variants we find that mass conservation
selects perturbations of spatial modes that simply redistribute mass. In 1-D,
only anti-phase oscillations between the two ends of the cell can occur, and
in-phase oscillations are excluded. In higher dimensions, no radially symmetric
oscillations are observed. Instead, the only instabilities are
symmetry-breaking, either corresponding to stationary Turing instabilities,
leading to the formation of stationary patterns, or to oscillatory Turing
instabilities, leading to traveling and standing waves. Codimension-two
Bogdanov--Takens bifurcations occur when the two distinct instabilities
coincide, causing traveling waves to slow down and to eventually become

smaller voltage stability margin. To the best of authors' knowledge, this work

through numerical simulations. Even extension to general relativity has
recently been achieved. However, those solutions are by definition
dissipationless, meaning that the star is unable to accelerate particles and
let them radiate any photon. Interestingly, the force-free model has no free
parameter however it must be superseded by a dissipative mechanism within the
plasma. In this paper, we investigate the magnetosphere electrodynamics for
particles moving in the radiation reaction regime, using the limit where
acceleration is fully balanced by radiation, also called Aristotelian dynamics.
An Ohm's law is derived, from which the dissipation rate is controlled by a one
parameter family of solutions depending on the pair multiplicity~$\kappa$. The
spatial extension of the dissipation zone is found self-consistently from the
simulations. We show that the radiative magnetosphere of an aligned rotator
tends to the force-free regime whenever the pair multiplicity becomes
moderately large, $\kappa \gg 1$. However, for low multiplicity, a substantial
fraction of the spindown energy goes into particle acceleration and radiation
in addition to the Poynting flux, the latter remaining only dominant for large
multiplicities. We show that the work done on the plasma occurs predominantly
in the equatorial current sheet right outside the light-cylinder.

useful in characterizing such properties of orderly retinal mosaics, they are
rarely sufficient for conveying the natural variation in the self-spacing

the strengths and limitations of different spatial statistical analyses for

for determining simply whether a population is ""regular"", they should be
treated as descriptive statistics that convey variation in the factors that

were simulated using the same cosmological models as the BAHAMAS and C-EAGLE
projects, leading to differences in both the hydrodynamic solvers and the
subgrid physics but still producing clusters which broadly match observations.
At the same mass resolution as BAHAMAS, for the most massive clusters ($M_{500}

pairs of images depicting the same object appearance, but no pose annotations.
We propose an additional classifier that estimates the minimal amount of

Previous methods based on adversarial approaches fail to enforce this

uninformative representations. In experiments on diverse object categories, the

appropriate spherical harmonics. The energy of the states and their angular
resolution is computed with CFT operator methods and is independent of having
an AdS interpretation. In the semiclassical limit of large conformal dimension
operators, these correspond to single particles localized within subAdS scales
with width $1/\sqrt{\Delta}$ in AdS units, whose subsequent evolution is
controlled by bulk geodesics. Our construction allows us to place a particle in
any desired geodesic. For radial geodesics, we show that the amplitude to
produce the desired state can be thought of as a regularized tunneling
amplitude from the boundary to the radial turning point of the radial geodesic,
while for other geodesics we argue that the insertion is at the outermost
radial turning point of the corresponding geodesic.

improved when the cluster size becomes smaller. In addition, we analyze the

  mixtures of skewed item curves",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most Item Response Theory (IRT) models for dichotomous responses are based on
probit or logit link functions which assume a symmetric relationship between
the probability of a correct response and the latent traits of individuals
submitted to a test. This assumption restricts the use of those models to the
case in which all items have a symmetric behaviour. On the other hand,
asymmetric models proposed in the literature impose that all the items in a
test have an asymmetric behaviour. This assumption is inappropriate for great
part of the tests which are, in general, composed by both symmetric and
asymmetric items. Furthermore, a straightforward extension of the existing
models in the literature would require a prior selection of the items'
symmetry/asymmetry status. This paper proposes a Bayesian IRT model that
accounts for symmetric and asymmetric items in a flexible though parsimonious
way. That is achieved by assigning a finite mixture prior to the skewness
parameter, with one of the mixture components being a point-mass at zero. This
allows for analyses under both model selection and model averaging approaches.
Asymmetric item curves are designed through the centred skew normal
distribution, which has a particularly appealing parametrisation in terms of
parameter interpretation and computational efficiency. An efficient MCMC
algorithm is proposed to perform Bayesian inference and its performance is
investigated in some simulated examples. Finally, the proposed methodology is
applied to a data set from a large scale educational exam in Brazil.

normal-core spheroids having M_* ~ 8 x 10^10 - 10^12 M_sun. While the two types

core-S\'ersic sigma-L_V relation occurring at M_V ~ -23.50 +- 0.10 mag.
Furthermore, we find a strong log-linear R_b-M_BH relation for the 11 galaxies

large-core galaxies ---such that R_b prop M_BH^(0.83 +- 0.10). However, for the
large-core galaxies the SMBH masses estimated from the M_BH-sigma and
core-S\'ersic M_BH-L relations are undermassive, by up to a factor of 40,
relative to expectations from their large R_b values, confirming earlier
results. Our findings suggest that large-core galaxies harbour overmassive

diabatic and adiabatic components, in order to understand their different
responses to changes of insolation and rotation rate. As insolation or rotation
period increases, the meridional circulation tends to become more diabatically

dominated by diabatic processes, while the high obliquity configuration has two
circulation regimes: an adiabatic-dominant regime in the limit of low
insolation and fast rotation, and a diabatic-dominant regime in the opposite

atmospheric zonal wind and the column cloud cover. The momentum-driven
circulation, the dominant circulation component in the weak-insolation and
fast-rotating regimes is found to resemble that in a dry dynamic model forced

propose a new approach to automatically evolving similarity functions for a

how the evolved similarity functions can be used to perform clustering using a
graph-based representation. The results of a variety of experiments across a
range of large, high-dimensional datasets show that the proposed approach can
achieve higher and more consistent performance than the benchmark methods. We
further extend the proposed approach to automatically produce multiple
complementary similarity functions by using a multi-tree approach, which gives
further performance improvements. We also analyse the interpretability and

logarithmic regret in the case of a convex polytope action set. Furthermore, we
show that the structural side information leads to expected regret that does
not depend on the number of extreme points in the action space. Therefore, we
obtain practical solutions even in high dimensional problems.

(HSI) and a multispectral image (MSI) to produce a super-resolution image
(SRI). Recently, a coupled tensor factorization approach was proposed to handle
this challenging problem, which admits a series of advantages over the classic
matrix factorization-based methods. In particular, modeling the HSI and MSI as
low-rank tensors following the {\it canonical polyadic decomposition} (CPD)
model, the approach is able to provably identify the SRI, under some mild
conditions. However, the latent factors in the CPD model have no physical
meaning, which makes utilizing prior information of spectral images as
constraints or regularizations difficult---but using such information is often
important in practice, especially when the data is noisy. In this work, we
propose an alternative coupled tensor decomposition approach, where the HSI and
MSI are assumed to follow the {\it block-term decomposition (BTD)} model.
Notably, the new method also entails identifiability of the SRI under realistic
conditions. More importantly, when modeling a spectral image as a BTD tensor,
the latent factors have clear physical meaning, and thus prior knowledge about
spectral images can be naturally incorporated. Simulations using real
hyperspectral images are employed to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed
approach with nonnegativity constraints.

the model training is performed on high performance compute nodes and the
training data is stored near these nodes for faster training. But there is a
growing interest in enabling training near the data. For instance, mobile
devices are rich sources of training data. It may not be feasible to
consolidate the data from mobile devices into a cloud service, due to bandwidth
and data privacy reasons. Training at mobile devices is however fraught with
challenges. First mobile devices may join or leave the distributed setting,
either voluntarily or due to environmental uncertainties, such as lack of
power. Tolerating uncertainties is critical to the success of distributed
mobile training. One proactive approach to tolerate computational uncertainty
is to store data in a coded format and perform training on coded data. Encoding
data is a challenging task since erasure codes require multiple devices to
exchange their data to create a coded data partition, which places a
significant bandwidth constraint. Furthermore, coded computing traditionally
relied on a central node to encode and distribute data to all the worker nodes,
which is not practical in a distributed mobile setting.
  In this paper, we tackle the uncertainty in distributed mobile training using
a bandwidth-efficient encoding strategy. We use a Random Linear Network coding
(RLNC) which reduces the need to exchange data partitions across all
participating mobile devices, while at the same time preserving the property of
coded computing to tolerate uncertainties. We implement gradient descent for
logistic regression and SVM to evaluate the effectiveness of our mobile
training framework. We demonstrate a 50% reduction in total required
communication bandwidth compared to MDS coded computation, one of the popular
erasure codes.

Here, we propose a way to circumvent the direct evaluation of such quantities,
provided that the employed measures satisfy a self-similarity property. We say
that a quantity ${\cal E}(\rho^{\otimes N})$ is {\it scalable} if it can be
described as a function of the variables $\{{\cal E}(\rho^{\otimes

the tensor-product structure. If analyticity is assumed, recursive relations
can be derived for the Maclaurin series of ${\cal E}(\rho^{\otimes N})$, which
enable us to determine its possible functional forms (in terms of the mentioned
variables). In particular, we find that if ${\cal E}(\rho^{\otimes 2^n})$
depends only on ${\cal E}(\rho)$, ${\cal E}(\rho^{\otimes 2})$, and $n$, then
it is completely determined by Fibonacci polynomials, to leading order. We show
that the one-shot distillable (OSD) entanglement is well described as a
scalable measure for several families of states. For a particular two-qutrit

Boltzmann gas. Of particular interest are the dispersing billiards, where $D$
consists of a union of finitely many open convex regions. These billiard flows
are known to be ergodic and to possess the $K$-property. However, Turaev and
Rom-Kedar (1998) proved that for dispersing systems permitting singular
periodic orbits, there exists a family of smooth Hamiltonian flows with regions
of stability near such orbits, converging to the billiard flow. They conjecture
that systems possessing such singular periodic orbits are dense in the space of
all dispersing billiard systems and remark that if this conjecture is true then
every dispersing billiard system is arbitrarily close to a non-ergodic smooth
Hamiltonian flow with regions of stability. In this paper, we consider billiard
tables consisting of the complement to a union of open unit disks with disjoint

emergent metallic state at high pressures as the unit cell shrinks and the
electronic bandwidth broadens to fill the insulating energy band gap. Here we
report a rare insulating state that persists up to at least 185 GPa in the
antiferromagnetic iridate Sr2IrO4, which is the archetypical spin-orbit-driven
Jeff = 1/2 insulator. This study shows the electrical resistance of
single-crystal Sr2IrO4 initially decreases with applied pressure, reaches a
minimum in the range, 32 - 38 GPa, then abruptly rises to fully recover the
insulating state with further pressure increases up to 185 GPa. Our synchrotron
x-ray diffraction and Raman scattering data show the onset of the rapid
increase in resistance is accompanied by a structural phase transition from the
native tetragonal I41/acd phase to an orthorhombic Pbca phase (with much
reduced symmetry) at 40.6 GPa. The clear-cut correspondence of these two
anomalies is key to understanding the stability of the insulating state at
megabar pressures: Pressure-induced, severe structural distortions prevent the
expected metallization, despite the 26% volume compression attained at the
highest pressure accessed in this study. Moreover, the resistance of Sr2IrO4
remains stable while the applied pressure is tripled from 61 GPa to 185 GPa.
These results suggest that a novel type of electronic Coulomb correlation
compensates the anticipated band broadening in strongly spin-orbit-coupled
materials at megabar pressures.

exhibit a magnetoelectric response which is described by axion electrodynamics.
A direct consequence of this theory is the appearance of a magnetic field that
resembles the one produced by a magnetic image monopole when a point-like
electric charge is located near the surface of the material. In this paper we
investigate the more realistic problem when the point-like charge is replaced
by a finite size sphere at constant potential. We calculate the electromagnetic
fields using the potential formulation in a particular bispherical coordinate
system. We find that the electromagnetic fields can be interpreted in terms of
point electric and image magnetic charges as if the medium were the vacuum. As
a manifestation of the magnetoelectric effect, we highlight the resulting
magnetic field, which we analyze in detail along the symmetry axis, since such
estimates could be useful in evaluating the experimental possibility of its
measurement via sensible magnetometers. Our numerical estimates show that the
proposed setup provides a magnetic field strength in the range of 10-100 mG,
which is attainable with present day sensitivities in NV center-diamond
magnetometers, for example.

TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) images from early 2017 September

renders more stringent constraints on its physical properties thanks to the
extreme forward-scattering observing geometry. Assuming geometric albedo $p_V =
0.1$, the effective scattering cross-section of any dust coma was $\lesssim
\left(2.1 \pm 0.2 \right) \times 10^{4}$ m$^{2}$. Assuming it behaved like a
typical solar-system comet this would correspond to a total mass of $\lesssim
20 \pm 2$ kg, and a water production rate of $\lesssim \left(6.1 \pm 0.5
\right) \times 10^{25}$ s$^{-1}$ at heliocentric distance $r_{\rm H} = 0.375$

smaller than any of the previously reported upper limits by at least an order
of magnitude. To exhibit the reported nongravitational motion with our default
assumptions requires a nucleus bulk density $\lesssim$40 kg m$^{-3}$; higher
bulk densities are possible for other assumptions. Alternatively, we show that
thermal fracturing could have plausibly removed an inert surface layer between
these observations and discovery, thus initiating activity after `Oumuamua left

The polarized transient spectra reveal optical transitions between the
uppermost spin-split H4 and H5 and the degenerate H6 valence bands (VB) and the
lowest degenerate H6 conduction band (CB) as well as a higher energy transition
at the L-point. Surprisingly, the degeneracy of the H6 CB (a proposed Weyl

before relaxing to equilibrium as the carriers decay. Using ab initio density
functional theory (DFT) calculations we conclude that the dynamic band
structure is caused by a photoinduced shear strain in the Te film that breaks
the screw symmetry of the crystal. The band-edge anisotropy is also reflected
in the hot carrier decay rate, which is a factor of two slower along c-axis
than perpendicular to it. The majority of photoexcited carriers near the
band-edge are seen to recombine within 30 ps while higher lying transitions
observed near 1.2 eV appear to have substantially longer lifetimes, potentially
due to contributions of intervalley processes in the recombination rate. These
new findings shed light on the strong correlation between photoinduced carriers

pathway for designing novel Te-based devices that take advantage of the

characteristics. While this multiple-scale BMS removes the double-counting
problem, it loses the prime benefit of simplicity. Alternatively, we argue that
the double-counting problem can be viewed as an inefficiency of the
optimization process. Furthermore, we show that the double-counting problem can
be resolved by fully optimizing the BMS setting, but retaining the traditional
BMS format.

dispersion. Traditionally, this has exclusively involved second-order
dispersion, while higher-order dispersion was treated as a nuisance to be

leveraged to access an uncharted regime of ultrafast laser operation. In
particular, we demonstrate a mode-locked laser, with an intra-cavity spectral
pulse-shaper, that emits pure-quartic soliton pulses, which arise from the
interaction of the fourth-order dispersion and the Kerr nonlinearity. Using
phase-resolved measurements we demonstrate that the energy of these pulses is
proportional to the third power of the inverse pulse duration. This implies a
dramatic increase in the energy of ultrashort pulses compared to those emitted
by soliton lasers to date. These results not only demonstrate a novel approach
to ultrafast lasers, but more fundamentally, they clarify the use of
higher-order dispersion for optical pulse control, opening up a plethora of
possibilities in nonlinear optics and its applications.

present an unsupervised perceptual-assisted adversarial adaptation (PAAA)

discrepancies between different domains. The adversarial adaptation module in
the proposed framework encourages the prediction structure information of the
target domain to be similar to that of the source domain. Besides, a perceptual
loss is employed for matching their shape information (the curvatures of
Bruch's membrane and choroid-sclera interface) which can result in a fine
boundary prediction. The results of quantitative experiments show that the

created by affine change of variables of a single Gaussian in $n$ dimensions.
$\mathcal{D}$ is used pervasively in scientific applications to a degree that
practitioners often employ it as their default choice for representing their
scientific object. Its use in applications hinges on the perception that this
dictionary is large enough, and its members are local enough in space and
frequency, to provide efficient approximation to ""almost all objects of

theoretical results are actually known on the ability to use Gaussian mixtures
in lieu of mainstream representation systems. The present paper shows that, in
2D, Gaussian mixtures are effective in resolving anisotropic structures, too.
In this setup, the ""smoothness class"" is comprised of 2D functions that are
sparsely represented using curvelets. An algorithm for $N$-term approximation
from (a small subset of) $\mathcal{D}$ is presented, and the error bounds are
then shown to be on par with the errors of $N$-term curvelet approximation. The

UCC theory, implementation on a quantum computer requires a finite-order
Suzuki-Trotter decomposition to separate the exponentials of the large sum of
Pauli operators. While previous literature has recognized the non-uniqueness of
different orderings of the operators in the Trotterized form of UCC methods,
the question of whether or not different orderings matter at the chemical scale

with the onset of tachycardia upon postural change. The current diagnosis
involves the measurement of heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) during

changes with more than 30 bpm (40 bpm in patients aged 12-19 years), ignoring
all of the BP and most of the HR signals. This study examines 0.1 Hz
oscillations in systolic arterial blood pressure (SBP) and HR signals providing
additional metrics characterizing the dynamics of the baroreflex. Methods: We
analyze data from 28 control subjects and 28 POTS patients who underwent HUT.
We extract beat-to-beat HR and SBP during a 10 min interval including 5 minutes
of baseline and 5 minutes of HUT. We employ Uniform Phase Empirical Mode
Decomposition (UPEMD) to extract 0.1 Hz stationary modes from both signals and
use random forest machine learning and k-means clustering to analyze the
outcomes. Results show that the amplitude of the 0.1 Hz oscillations is higher
in POTS patients and that the phase response between the two signals is shorter
(p < 0.005). Conclusion: POTS is associated with an increase in the amplitude
of SBP and HR 0.1 Hz oscillation and a shortening of the phase between the two
signals. Significance: The 0.1 Hz phase response and oscillation amplitude
metrics provide new markers that can improve POTS diagnostic augmenting the
existing diagnosis protocol only analyzing the change in heart rate.

of the bee-identification error exponent, and show that independent barcode
decoding is optimal, i.e., joint decoding of the bee barcodes does not result
in a better error exponent relative to independent decoding of each noisy
barcode. This is in contrast to the result without absentee bees, where joint
barcode decoding results in a significantly higher error exponent than
independent barcode decoding. We also define and characterize the ""capacity""
for the bee-identification problem with absentee bees, and prove the strong

latent representations full of AU information are learned through an

spaces is important for understanding the ever-increasing complexity of urban

previous studies demonstrate the potential of GTSM records for spatiotemporal
activity modeling. State-of-the-art methods for this task embed different
modalities (location, time, and text) of GTSM records into a single embedding
space. However, they ignore Non-GeoTagged Social Media (NGTSM) records, which
generally account for the majority of posts (e.g., more than 95\% in Twitter),
and could represent a great source of information to alleviate the sparsity of
GTSM records. Furthermore, in the current spatiotemporal embedding techniques,
less focus has been given to the users, who exhibit spatially motivated
behaviors. To bridge this research gap, this work proposes USTAR, a novel
online learning method for User-guided SpatioTemporal Activity Representation,
which (1) embeds locations, time, and text along with users into the same
embedding space to capture their correlations; (2) uses a novel collaborative
filtering approach based on two different empirically studied user behaviors to
incorporate both NGTSM and GTSM records in learning; and (3) introduces a novel
sampling technique to learn spatiotemporal representations in an online fashion
to accommodate recent information into the embedding space, while avoiding
overfitting to recent records and frequently appearing units in social media
streams. Our results show that USTAR substantially improves the
state-of-the-art for region retrieval and keyword retrieval and its potential
to be applied to other downstream applications such as local event detection.

Advantages of the detector are its low computational cost and small number of
trainable parameters, which enables us to treat massive SCDMA systems. In
particular, its computational cost is smaller than a conventional belief
propagation (BP) detector while the STPG detector exhibits nearly same
detection performance with a BP detector. We also propose a scalable joint

During the MWP, dust delivery to CA decreased, though Fe-intensity in the core

strong westerlies blocked meridional flow reducing Fe-rich dust input from the

observational data include the current newly-compiled SNe Ia data (Pantheon

distances ($D_L$) possibly affected by the cosmic opacity, as well as strongly
lensed SNe Ia observed by the LSST, which are responsible for providing the
observed time-delay distance ($D_{\Delta t}$) unaffected by the cosmic opacity.
Two parameterizations, $\tau(z)=2\beta z$ and $\tau(z)=(1+z)^{2\beta}-1$ are
adopted for the optical depth associated to the cosmic absorption. Focusing on
only one specific type of standard cosmological probe, this provides an
original method to measure cosmic opacity at high precision. Working on the
simulated sample of strongly lensed SNe Ia observed by the LSST in 10 year
$z$-band search, our results show that, with the combination of the current

from the transparency of the Universe at the current observational data level.
Moreover, strongly lensed SNe Ia in a 10 year LSST $z$-band search would
produce more robust constraints on the validity of cosmic transparency (at the
precision of $\Delta\beta=10^{-2}$), with a larger sample of unlensed SNe Ia
detected in future LSST survey. We have also discussed the ways in which our

integration method for an eight-dimensional Hamiltonian system with four
degrees of freedom. In our algorithm, each partial derivative of the
Hamiltonian with respect to one of phase-space variables is discretized by the
average of eight Hamiltonian difference terms. Such a discretization form is a
second-order approximation to the Hamiltonian gradient. It is shown numerically
via simulations of an FPU-$\beta$ system and a post-Newtonian conservative
system of compact binaries with one body spinning that the newly proposed
method has extremely good energy-conserving performance, compared to the
Runge-Kutta, implicit midpoint symplectic method and extended phase-space
explicit symplectic-like integrators. The new method is advantageous over very
long times and for large time steps compared to state-of-the-art Runge-Kutta
method in the accuracy of numerical solutions. Although such an
energy-conserving integrator exhibits a higher computational cost than any one
of the other three algorithms, the superior results justify its use for
satisfying some specific purposes on the preservation of energies in numerical
simulations with much longer times, e.g. obtaining a high enough accuracy of
the semimajor axis in a Keplerian problem in the Solar System or accurately
grasping the frequency of a gravitational wave from a circular orbit in a
post-Newtonian system of compact binaries. The new integrator will be
potentially applied to model time-varying external electromagnetic fields or
time-dependent spacetimes.

classifiers trained for this task usually rely on a training set containing CT
volumes and their respective image-level (i.e., global) annotation. However,
the lack of annotations for the localisation of the regions of interest (ROIs)
containing lymph nodes can limit classification accuracy due to the small size
of the relevant ROIs in this problem. The use of lymph node ROIs together with
global annotations in a multi-task training process has the potential to
improve classification accuracy, but the high cost involved in obtaining the
ROI annotation for the same samples that have global annotations is a roadblock
for this alternative. We address this limitation by introducing a new training
strategy from two data sets: one containing the global annotations, and another
(publicly available) containing only the lymph node ROI localisation. We term
our new strategy semi-supervised multi-domain multi-task training, where the
goal is to improve the diagnosis accuracy on the globally annotated data set by
incorporating the ROI annotations from a different domain. Using a private data
set containing global annotations and a public data set containing lymph node
ROI localisation, we show that our proposed training mechanism improves the

forming liquids near the glass transition temperature. It consists in a
non-monotonous evolution of the volume/enthalpy after a succession of two
abrupt temperature changes: first from a high initial temperature $T_i$ to a
much lower annealing temperature $T_a$ followed by a smaller second jump back
to a slightly higher final temperature $T_f$. The second change is performed
when the instantaneous value of the volume/enthalpy coincides with the
equilibrium one at the final temperature. While this protocol might be expected
to yield equilibrium dynamics right after the second temperature change, one
observes the so-called Kovacs hump in glassy systems. In this paper we apply
such thermal protocol to the Distinguishable Particles Lattice Model (DPLM) for
a wide range of fragility of the system. We study the Kovacs hump based on
energy relaxation and all main experimental features are captured. Results are
compared to general predictions based on a master equation approach in the
linear response limit. We trace the origin of the Kovacs hump to the
non-equilibrium nature of the probability distribution of particle interaction
energies after the annealing and find that its difference with respect to the
final equilibrium distribution is non-vanishing with two isolated zeros. This
allows Kovacs' condition of equilibrium total energy to be met
out-of-equilibrium, thus representing the memory content of the system.
Furthermore, the hump is taller and occurs at a larger overlap with the system
initial configuration for more fragile systems. The dynamics of a structural
temperature for the mobile regions strongly depends on the glass fragility
while for the immobile ones only a weak dependence is found.

spatio-temporal data arising from a class of stochastic convection-diffusion
processes. Such processes are widely found in scientific and engineering
applications where fundamental physics imposes critical constraints on how data
can be modeled and how models should be interpreted. The idea of spectrum
decomposition is employed to approximate a physical spatio-temporal process by
the linear combination of spatial basis functions and a multivariate random
process of spectral coefficients. Unlike existing approaches assuming
spatially- and temporally-invariant convection-diffusion, this paper considers
a more general scenario with spatially-varying convection-diffusion and
nonzero-mean source-sink. As a result, the temporal dynamics of spectral
coefficients is coupled with each other, which can be interpreted as the
non-linear energy redistribution across multiple scales from the perspective of
physics. Because of the spatially-varying convection-diffusion, the space-time
covariance is non-stationary in space. The theoretical results are integrated
into a hierarchical dynamical spatio-temporal model. The connection is
established between the proposed model and the existing models based on
Integro-Difference Equations. Computational efficiency and scalability are also
investigated to make the proposed approach practical. The advantages of the
proposed methodology are demonstrated by numerical examples, a case study, and
comprehensive comparison studies. Computer code is available on GitHub.

shields are typically implemented in a centralized manner, requiring global
information on the state of all agents in the system. We address these
limitations through a new approach where the shields are synthesized at runtime
and do not require global information. There is a shield onboard every agent,
which can only modify the behavior of the corresponding agent. In this
approach, which is fundamentally decentralized, the shield on every agent has
two components: a pathfinder that corrects the behavior of the agent and an
ordering mechanism that dynamically modifies the priority of the agent. The
current priority determines if the shield uses the pathfinder to modify
behavior of the agent. We derive an upper bound on the maximum deviation for
any agent from its original behavior. We prove that the worst-case synthesis
time is quadratic in the number of agents at runtime as opposed to exponential
at design-time for existing methods. We test the performance of the
decentralized, runtime shield synthesis approach on a collision-avoidance
problem. For 50 agents in a 50x50 grid, the synthesis at runtime requires a few
seconds per agent whenever a potential collision is detected. In contrast, the
centralized design-time synthesis of shields for a similar setting is
intractable beyond 4 agents in a 5x5 grid.

factor structure. The focus is to find what is possible and what is impossible
if the usual strong factor condition is not imposed. We study the minimax rate
and adaptivity issues in two problems: pure factor models and panel regression
with interactive fixed effects. For pure factor models, if the number of
factors is known, we develop adaptive estimation and inference procedures that
attain the minimax rate. However, when the number of factors is not specified a
priori, we show that there is a tradeoff between validity and efficiency: any
confidence interval that has uniform validity for arbitrary factor strength has
to be conservative; in particular its width is bounded away from zero even when
the factors are strong. Conversely, any data-driven confidence interval that
does not require as an input the exact number of factors (including weak ones)
and has shrinking width under strong factors does not have uniform coverage and
the worst-case coverage probability is at most 1/2. For panel regressions with
interactive fixed effects, the tradeoff is much better. We find that the
minimax rate for learning the regression coefficient does not depend on the
factor strength and propose a simple estimator that achieves this rate.
However, when weak factors are allowed, uncertainty in the number of factors
can cause a great loss of efficiency although the rate is not affected. In most
cases, we find that the strong factor condition (and/or exact knowledge of
number of factors) improves efficiency, but this condition needs to be imposed
by faith and cannot be verified in data for inference purposes.

period (Suess-de Vries cycle), and a few periods around 100 years (Gleissberg
cycle). Encouraged by their robustness, we support previous forecasts of an
upcoming grand minimum in the 21st century. To explain the long-term cycles, we
enhance our tidally synchronized solar dynamo model by a modulation of the
field storage capacity of the tachocline with the orbital angular momentum of
the Sun, which is dominated by the 19.86-year periodicity of the Jupiter-Saturn
synodes. This modulation of the 22.14 years Hale cycle leads to a 193-year beat
period of dynamo activity which is indeed close to the Suess-de Vries cycle.
For stronger dynamo modulation, the model produces additional peaks at typical
Gleissberg frequencies, which seem to be explainable by the non-linearities of
the basic beat process, leading to a bi-modality of the Schwabe cycle. However,
a complementary role of beat periods between the Schwabe cycle and the
Jupiter-Uranus/Neptune synodic cycles cannot be completely excluded.

quantified, although it is often larger than the instrumental precision of
modern high-resolution spectrographs used for Doppler planet detection and
characterization. We aim to empirically determine the intrinsic stellar RV
variation for mostly G and K dwarf stars on different timescales and for
different stellar ages independently of stellar models. We also focus on young
stars ($\lesssim$ 30 Myr), where the RV variation is known to be large. We use
archival FEROS and HARPS RV data of stars which were observed at least 30 times
spread over at least two years. We then apply the pooled variance (PV)
technique to these data sets to identify the periods and amplitudes of
underlying, quasiperiodic signals. We show that the PV is a powerful tool to
identify quasiperiodic signals in highly irregularly sampled data sets. We
derive activity-lag functions for 20 putative single stars, where lag is the
timescale on which the stellar jitter is measured. Since the ages of all stars
are known, we also use this to formulate an activity--age--lag relation which
can be used to predict the expected RV jitter of a star given its age and the
timescale to be probed. The maximum RV jitter on timescales of decades
decreases from over 500 m/s for 5 Myr-old stars to 2.3 m/s for stars with ages

1 d instead of 1 yr is smaller by roughly a factor of 4 for 5 Myr old stars,
and a factor of 1.5 for stars with an age of 5 Gyr. The rate at which the RV
jitter increases with lag strongly depends on stellar age and ranges from a few
days for a few 10 Myr old stars to presumably decades for stars with an age of
a few gigayears.

path algebra $L_R(E)$ with coefficients in a unital ring $R$ is graded von
Neumann regular if and only if $R$ is von Neumann regular. We also prove that
both Leavitt path algebras and corner skew Laurent polynomial rings over von

framework that can accurately reconstruct images from undersampled k-space data
with a much lower sampling rate than the one set by the classical
Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. Therefore, CS-MRI can efficiently accelerate
acquisition time and relieve the psychological burden on patients while
maintaining high imaging quality. The problems with traditional CS-MRI
reconstruction are solved by iterative numerical solvers, which usually suffer
from expensive computational cost and the lack of accurate handcrafted priori.
In this paper, inspired by deep learning's (DL's) fast inference and excellent
end-to-end performance, we propose a novel cascaded convolutional neural
network called MD-Recon-Net to facilitate fast and accurate MRI reconstruction.
Especially, different from existing DL-based methods, which operate on single
domain data or both domains in a certain order, our proposed MD-Recon-Net
contains two parallel and interactive branches that simultaneously perform on
k-space and spatial-domain data, exploring the latent relationship between
k-space and the spatial domain. The simulated experimental results show that
the proposed method not only achieves competitive visual effects to several
state-of-the-art methods, but also outperforms other DL-based methods in terms
of model scale and computational cost.

the evolution of sunspots in the three regions of the active-region NOAA 12673
in detail. The evolution of sunspots in the three regions were all involved in
the interaction of two magnetic field systems: the pre-existing magnetic field
system and the later emerging magnetic field system. Through analyzing the
photospheric magnetic field properties, it is found that the formation of the
penumbra originated from the newly emerging magnetic bipole that were trapped
in the photosphere. The change of magnetic fields in penumbra from horizontal
to vertical can cause the disappearance of penumbra. The transformation of the
magnetic field between the umbra and the penumbra is found and the outward moat
flow around sunspot gradually decreased and vanished during the decay of
sunspot. In addition, we found that the mean longitudinal magnetic strength in
penumbra decreased and the mean transverse magnetic strength in penumbra
increased with the increasing penumbral area during the formation of sunspots.
However, during the decay of sunspots, the mean longitudinal magnetic strength
in penumbra increased and the mean transverse magnetic strength in penumbra
decreased with the decreasing penumbral area. Comparatively, the dependence of
the area and the mean transverse/longitudinal magnetic field strength in umbra

particle-hole symmetry, class CI, as $\nu=1.16\pm 0.02$. We further study
disorder-driven quantum phase transitions in the 3D nodal line Dirac semimetal
model, which belongs to class BDI, and estimate critical exponent as
$\nu=0.80\pm 0.02$. From a comparison of the critical exponents, we conclude
that a disorder-driven re-entrant insulator-metal transition from the
topological insulator phase in the class BDI to the diffusive metal phase
belongs to the same universality class as the Anderson transition in the 3D
class BDI. We also argue that an infinitesimally small disorder drives the
nodal line Dirac semimetal in the clean limit to the diffusive metal.

learning to train neural networks for offline ranking in information retrieval
(IR). We call our method BanditRank as it treats ranking as a contextual bandit
problem. In the domain of learning to rank for IR, current deep learning models
are trained on objective functions different from the measures they are
evaluated on. Since most evaluation measures are discrete quantities, they
cannot be leveraged by directly using gradient descent algorithms without an
approximation. BanditRank bridges this gap by directly optimizing a
task-specific measure, such as mean average precision (MAP), using gradient
descent. Specifically, a contextual bandit whose action is to rank input
documents is trained using a policy gradient algorithm to directly maximize the
reward. The reward can be a single measure, such as MAP, or a combination of
several measures. The notion of ranking is also inherent in BanditRank, similar
to the current \textit{listwise} approaches. To evaluate the effectiveness of
BanditRank, we conducted a series of experiments on datasets related to three
different tasks, i.e., web search, community, and factoid question answering.
We found that it performs better than state-of-the-art methods when applied on
the question answering datasets. On the web search dataset, we found that
BanditRank performed better than four strong listwise baselines including
LambdaMART, AdaRank, ListNet and Coordinate Ascent.

nonempty common intersection. Motivated by previous work on dually chordal
graphs and graphs of bounded distance VC-dimension we prove several new results
on the complexity of computing the diameter and the radius on Helly graphs and
related graph classes.
  * First, we present algorithms which given an $n$-vertex $m$-edge Helly graph
$G$ as input, compute w.h.p. its radius and its diameter in time $\tilde{\cal
O}(m\sqrt{n})$. Our algorithms are based on the Helly property and on several
implications of the unimodality of the eccentricity function in Helly graphs:
every vertex of locally minimum eccentricity is a central vertex.
  * Then, we focus on $C_4$-free Helly graphs, which include, amongst other
subclasses, bridged Helly graphs and so, chordal Helly graphs and hereditary
Helly graphs. For the $C_4$-free Helly graphs, we present linear-time
algorithms for computing the eccentricity of all vertices. Doing so, we
generalize previous results on strongly chordal graphs to a much larger
subclass.
  * Finally, we derive from our findings on chordal Helly graphs a more general
one-to-many reduction from diameter computation on chordal graphs to either
diameter computation on split graphs or the {\sc Disjoint Set} problem.
Therefore, split graphs are in some sense the {\em only} hard instances for
diameter computation on chordal graphs. As a byproduct of our reduction the
eccentricity of all vertices in a chordal graph can be approximated in ${\cal
O}(m\log{n})$ time with an additive one-sided error of at most one, and on any
subclass of chordal graphs with constant VC-dimension the diameter can be
computed in truly subquadratic time.
  These above results are a new step toward better understanding the role of
abstract geometric properties in the fast computation of metric graph
invariants.

Specifically, we utilize a revised ResNet152 as our backbone to improve the

adopt EfficientNet as encoder because of its powerful feature extraction

viscous shocks (so-called traveling waves), and in literature, their nonlinear
stabilities have been considered in the class of certain mean-zero small
perturbations. We show the global existence of the solution without assuming
the mean-zero condition for any initial data as arbitrarily large perturbations
around traveling waves in the Sobolev space $H^1$ while the shock strength is
assumed to be small enough. The main novelty of this paper is to develop the
global well-posedness of any large $H^1$-perturbations of traveling wave
connecting two different end states. The discrepancy of the end states is
linked to the complexity of the corresponding flux, which requires a new type
of an energy estimate. To overcome, we use the a priori contraction estimate of
a weighted relative entropy functional up to a translation, which was proved by
Choi-Kang-Kwon-Vasseur. The boundedness of the shift implies a priori bound of
the relative entropy functional without a shift on any time interval of
existence, which produces a $H^1$-estimate thanks to a De Giorgi type lemma.
Moreover, to remove possibility of vacuum appearance, we use the lemma again.

of the model plays a crucial role for the statistical properties of the

blockchains but lacks formal grounds, nurturing skepticism on whether such
complex systems can scale blockchains securely. We fill this gap by introducing
the first formal framework as well as a roadmap to robust sharding. In
particular, we first define the properties sharded distributed ledgers should
fulfill. We build upon and extend the Bitcoin backbone protocol by defining
consistency and scalability. Consistency encompasses the need for atomic
execution of cross-shard transactions to preserve safety, whereas scalability
encapsulates the speedup a sharded system can gain in comparison to a
non-sharded system.
  Using our model, we explore the limitations of sharding. We show that a
sharded ledger with $n$ participants cannot scale under a fully adaptive
adversary, but it can scale up to $m$ shards where $n=c'm\log m$, under an
epoch-adaptive adversary; the constant $c'$ encompasses the trade-off between
security and scalability. This is possible only if the sharded ledgers create
succinct proofs of the valid state updates at every epoch. We leverage our
results to identify the sufficient components for robust sharding, which we
incorporate in a protocol abstraction termed Divide & Scale. To demonstrate the
power of our framework, we analyze the most prominent sharded blockchains
(Elastico, Monoxide, OmniLedger, RapidChain) and pinpoint where they fail to
meet the desired properties.

frequencies introduces new challenges for the propagation channel such as
higher path loss and rapid signal degradations. On the other hand, higher
frequencies allow deployment of small-sized antenna elements that enable
beamforming. To investigate user mobility under these new propagation
conditions, a proper model is needed that captures spatial and temporal
characteristics of the channel in beamformed networks. Current channel models
that have been developed for 5G networks are computationally inefficient and
lead to infeasible simulation time for most user mobility simulations. In this
paper, we present a simplified channel model that captures the spatial and
temporal characteristics of the 5G propagation channel and runs in feasible
simulation time. To this end, coherence time and path diversity originating
from fully fledged Geometry based Stochastic Channel Model (GSCM) are analyzed
and adopted in Jakes channel model. Furthermore, the deviation of multipath
beamforming gain from single ray beamforming gain is analyzed and a regression
curve is obtained to be used in the system-level simulations. We show through
simulations that the proposed simplified channel model leads to mobility
results comparable to Jakes model for high path diversity. Moreover, the
multi-path beamforming gain increases the interference in the system and in
turn number of mobility failures.

erg) long gamma-ray bursts within the binary-driven hypernova model. The
binary-driven hypernova progenitor is a binary system composed of a
carbon-oxygen star and a neutron star (NS) companion. The gravitational
collapse leads to a type Ic supernova (SN) explosion and triggers an accretion
process onto the NS. For orbital periods of a few minutes, the NS reaches the
critical mass and forms a black hole (BH). Two physical situations produce MeV
$\nu$s. First, during the accretion, the NS surface emits $\nu$-$\bar{\nu}$
pairs by thermal production. We calculate the properties and the flavor
evolution of such a $\nu$ emission. Second, if the angular momentum of the SN
ejecta is high enough, an accretion disk might form around the BH. The disk's
high density and temperature are ideal for MeV-$\nu$ production. We estimate
the flavor evolution and find that $\nu$ oscillation inside the disk leads to
flavor equipartition. This effect reduces (compared to assuming frozen flavor
content) the energy deposition rate of $\nu$-$\bar{\nu}$ annihilation into
electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) pairs in the BH vicinity. We then analyze the
production of GeV-TeV $\nu$s around the BH. The magnetic field surrounding the
BH interacts with the BH gravitomagnetic field producing an electric field that
leads to spontaneous $e^+e^-$ pairs by vacuum breakdown. The pairs plasma
self-accelerates due to its internal pressure and engulfs protons during the
expansion. The hadronic interaction of the protons in the expanding plasma with
the ambient protons leads to $\nu$ emission via the decay chain of $\pi$ and
$\mu$, around and far from the BH, along different directions. These $\nu$s
have GeV-TeV energies, and we calculate their spectrum and luminosity. We also
outline the detection probability by some current and future $\nu$ detectors.

MV-Sketch, a fast and compact invertible sketch that supports heavy flow

resolution. Specific tools are required to provide efficient scientific
analysis of such large data sets. Our aim is to illustrate the potential of
unsupervised learning methods to get insights into chemical variations in the
populations that carry the aromatic infrared bands (AIBs), more specifically
PAH species and carbonaceous very small grains (VSGs). We present a method
based on linear fitting and blind signal separation (BSS) for extracting
representative spectra for a spectral data set. The method is fast and robust,
which ensures its applicability to JWST spectral cubes. We tested this method
on a sample of ISO-SWS data, which resemble most closely the JWST spectra in
terms of spectral resolution and coverage. Four representative spectra were
extracted. Their main characteristics appear consistent with previous studies
with populations dominated by cationic PAHs, neutral PAHs, evaporating VSGs,
and large ionized PAHs, known as the PAH$^x$ population. In addition, the 3
$\mu$m range, which is considered here for the first time in a BSS method,
reveals the presence of aliphatics connected to neutral PAHs. Each
representative spectrum is found to carry second-order spectral signatures
(e.g. small bands), which are connected with the underlying chemical diversity
of populations. However, the precise attribution of theses signatures remains
limited by the combined small size and heterogeneity of the sample of
astronomical spectra available in this study. The upcoming JWST data will allow
us to overcome this limitation. The large data sets of hyperspectral images
provided by JWST analysed with the proposed method, which is fast and robust,
will open promising perspectives for our understanding of the chemical
evolution of the AIB carriers.

Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications to improve the safety and
efficiency of transportation systems. In this context, the combination of
ground vehicles, such as delivery trucks, with drones to assist in the last
mile pick-up and delivery of the parcels has been recently proposed. While
aerial vehicles promise increased efficiency based on flexible routes and
parallelized operation, highly reliable wireless communication is also required
for the control and coordination of potentially many drones acting in a
self-organized way. In this paper, we analyze the improvements procured by
drone usage in parcel delivery compared to traditional delivery and propose a
simulation framework to further quantify the efficiency gains of the parcel
delivery logistics and to analyze the performance of different wireless
communications options. To this end, we consider a heterogeneous vehicle
routing problem with various constraints. We consider two approaches regarding
the dispatching and recovery of drones and evaluate their benefits as opposed
to parcel delivery with a classic truck only. Furthermore, we compare two
networking technologies for enabling coordination of the self-organizing teams
of drones with a realistically modeled environment: one approach relying on
base station oriented Long Term Evolution (LTE) vs. a more decentralized
Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) solution. The results show time savings
of nearly 40% can be achieved through drone usage and that the negative impact
of urban shadowing on network communications in the base station oriented LTE
approach can be compensated by leveraging decentralized C-V2X communications

learning (ML) algorithm, coined quantized group ADMM (Q-GADMM). To reduce the
number of communication links, every worker in Q-GADMM communicates only with
two neighbors, while updating its model via the group alternating direction
method of multipliers (GADMM). Moreover, each worker transmits the quantized
difference between its current model and its previously quantized model,
thereby decreasing the communication payload size. However, due to the lack of
centralized entity in decentralized ML, the spatial sparsity and payload
compression may incur error propagation, hindering model training convergence.
To overcome this, we develop a novel stochastic quantization method to
adaptively adjust model quantization levels and their probabilities, while
proving the convergence of Q-GADMM for convex objective functions. Furthermore,
to demonstrate the feasibility of Q-GADMM for non-convex and stochastic
problems, we propose quantized stochastic GADMM (Q-SGADMM) that incorporates
deep neural network architectures and stochastic sampling. Simulation results
corroborate that Q-GADMM significantly outperforms GADMM in terms of
communication efficiency while achieving the same accuracy and convergence
speed for a linear regression task. Similarly, for an image classification task
using DNN, Q-SGADMM achieves significantly less total communication cost with
identical accuracy and convergence speed compared to its counterpart without
quantization, i.e., stochastic GADMM (SGADMM).

perception-based division to learn additive and multiplicative components,

the GAN model to better approximates the distribution distance on multiple

three hierarchies, we develop multiscale and recurrent training approaches to
optimize the image and video enhancement process in a weakly-supervised manner.
Both quantitative and qualitative results clearly demonstrate that the proposed

choice for mapping and localization. However, many common lidar models perform
poorly in unstructured, unpredictable environments, they lack a consistent
physical model for both mapping and localization, and they do not exploit all

observed by LIGO and Virgo require a high-accuracy, theory-based waveform model
for the analysis of the recorded signal. Current inspiral-merger-ringdown
models are calibrated only up to moderate mass ratios, thereby limiting their
applicability to signals from high-mass ratio binary systems. We present
EMRISur1dq1e4, a reduced-order surrogate model for gravitational waveforms of
13,500M in duration and including several harmonic modes for non-spinning black
hole binary systems with mass-ratios varying from 3 to 10,000 thus vastly
expanding the parameter range beyond the current models. This surrogate model
is trained on waveform data generated by point-particle black hole perturbation
theory (ppBHPT) both for large mass-ratio and comparable mass-ratio binaries.
We observe that the gravitational waveforms generated through a simple
application of ppBHPT to the comparable mass-ratio cases agree remarkably (and
surprisingly) well with those from full numerical relativity after a rescaling
of the ppBHPT's total mass parameter. This observation and the EMRISur1dq1e4
surrogate model will enable data analysis studies in the high-mass ratio
regime, including potential intermediate mass-ratio signals from LIGO/Virgo and
extreme-mass ratio events of interest to the future space-based observatory
LISA.

uncertainty in models of massive stars. While an increase in mass loss is
theoretically predicted, this has so far not been observationally confirmed.
However, radiation-driven winds of massive stars are known to exhibit clumpy
structures triggered by the line-deshadowing instability (LDI). Wind clumping
affects empirical mass-loss rates inferred from density square-dependent
spectral diagnostics. If clumping properties differ significantly for O and B
supergiants across the bi-stability jump, this may help alleviate discrepancies
between theory and observations. We investigate with analytical and numerical
tools how the onset of clumpy structures behaves in the winds of O supergiants
(OSG) and B supergiants (BSG) across the bi-stability jump. We derive a scaling
relation for the linear growth rate of the LDI for a single optically thick
line and apply it in both regimes. We run 1D time-dependent line-driven
instability simulations to study the non-linear evolution of the LDI in clumpy
OSG and BSG winds. Linear perturbation analysis for a single line shows that
the LDI linear growth rate scales strongly with stellar effective temperature
and terminal wind speed. This implies significantly lower growth rates for
(cooler, slower) BSG winds than for OSG winds. This is confirmed by the
non-linear simulations, which show significant differences in OSG and BSG wind
structure formation, with the latter characterized by significantly weaker
clumping factors and lower velocity dispersions. This suggests that lower
correction factors due to clumping should be employed when deriving empirical
mass-loss rates for BSGs on the cool side of the bi-stability jump. Moreover,
the non-linear simulations provide a theoretical background toward explaining
the general lack of observed intrinsic X-ray emission in (single) B star winds.

cell the probability that it reflects an incident laser beam. These algorithms
typically determine the map as the set of reflection probabilities that
maximizes the likelihood of the underlying laser data and do not compute the
full posterior distribution over all possible maps. Thereby, they discard
crucial information about the confidence of the estimate. The approach
presented in this paper preserves this information by determining the full map
posterior. In general, this problem is hard because distributions over
real-valued quantities can possess infinitely many dimensions. However, for two
state-of-the-art beam-based lidar models, our approach yields closed-form map
posteriors that possess only two parameters per cell. Even better, these
posteriors come for free, in the sense that they use the same parameters as the
traditional approaches, without the need for additional computations. An
important use case for grid maps is robot localization, which we formulate as
Bayesian filtering based on the closed-form map posterior rather than based on
a single map. The resulting measurement likelihoods can also be expressed in
closed form. In simulations and extensive real-world experiments, we show that
leveraging the full map posterior improves the localization accuracy compared
to approaches that use the most likely map.

We propose an efficient liver segmentation with the combination of

approach is based on effective identification of edge maps from multimodal

is applied to enhanced CT and MRI modality images to get a better edge map.
Finally, the Mask R-CNN is used to segment the liver from edge map images. We
used a dataset of 20 CT patients and 9 MR patients from the CHAOS challenge.
The system is trained on CT and MRI images separately and then converted to 2D
slices. We significantly improved the segmentation accuracy of CT and MRI

point to neutron star mergers as a probable $r$-process site, with the
optical/infrared `kilonova' emerging in the days after the merger a likely
place to detect the spectral signatures of newly-created neutron-capture
elements. The kilonova, AT2017gfo, emerging from the
gravitational-wave--discovered neutron star merger, GW170817, was the first
kilonova where detailed spectra were recorded. When these spectra were first
reported it was argued that they were broadly consonant with an outflow of
radioactive heavy elements, however, there was no robust identification of any
element. Here we report the identification of the neutron-capture element
strontium in a re-analysis of these spectra. The detection of a neutron-capture
element associated with the collision of two extreme-density stars establishes
the origin of $r$-process elements in neutron star mergers, and demonstrates
that neutron stars contain neutron-rich matter.

Stochastic Block Model is proposed as a unified probalistic framework tailored

heterogeneity in the patterns of connection within each level and introducing
dependencies between the levels. The sought connection patterns are not

used for the model inference and an Integrated Classified Likelihood criterion
is developed for choosing the number of blocks and also for deciding whether
the two levels are dependent or not. A comprehensive simulation study exhibits
the benefit of considering this approach, illustrates the robustness of the
clustering and highlights the reliability of the criterion used for model
selection. This approach is applied on a sociological dataset collected during
a television program trade fair, the inter-organizational level being the
economic network between companies and the inter-individual level being the
informal network between their representatives. It brings a synthetic

problems, existing works have shown that, if the distribution of the feature
vector has bounded support and the probability density function is bounded away
from zero in its support, the convergence rate of the standard kNN method, in
which k is the same for all test samples, is minimax optimal. On the contrary,
if the distribution has unbounded support, we show that there is a gap between
the convergence rate achieved by the standard kNN method and the minimax bound.
To close this gap, we propose an adaptive kNN method, in which different k is

significantly outperforms the standard one. We characterize the convergence

a hierarchy of spatial scales. To connect extragalactic star formation
relations from global and kpc-scale measurements to recent cloud-scale

the scale dependence of the relative spatial distributions of molecular gas and
recent star formation. In this paper, we apply this method to eight galaxies
with roughly 1 arcsec resolution molecular gas imaging from the PHANGS-ALMA and
PAWS surveys that have matched resolution, high quality narrowband Halpha
imaging. At a common scale of 140pc, our massive (log(Mstar/Msun)=9.3-10.7),
normally star-forming (SFR/Msun/yr=0.3-5.9) galaxies exhibit a significant
reservoir of quiescent molecular gas not associated with star formation as
traced by Halpha emission. Galactic structures act as backbones for both
molecular and HII region distributions. As we degrade the spatial resolution,
the quiescent molecular gas disappears, with the most rapid changes occurring
for resolutions up to about 0.5kpc. As the resolution becomes poorer, the
morphological features become indistinct for spatial scales larger than about
1kpc. The method is a promising tool to search for relationships between the
quiescent or star-forming molecular reservoir and galaxy properties, but
requires a larger sample size to identify robust correlations between the
star-forming molecular gas fraction and global galaxy parameters.

well these small particles are measured has never been addressed because of a
lack of a reliable benchmark. Here, to address this critical gap, we use an
approach that allows direct comparison of APT and small-angle (X-Ray)
scattering (SA(X)S) performed on the same material. We introduce the notion of
an effective spatial resolution for the analysis of particles, which,
importantly in this context, is very different than the technique's inherent
spatial resolution. This effective resolution is highly specific to the system
being considered, as well as the analysis conditions. There is no hard limit
below which the technique will fail, but particles with a radius of order of
\textapprox $2\sigma=1nm$, i.e. \textapprox\num{250} atoms cannot be accurately
measured, even though the particles are detected. This thorough metrological
assessment of APT in the analysis of particles allows us to discuss the pulse
spread function of the technique and the physics underpinning its limits. We
conclude that great care should be taken when analysing solute clusters by APT,
in particular when reporting particle size and composition.

""How to segment skin lesion images using a neural network with low available

performing network structure, training data and training method. First theory
associated with these questions is discussed. Literature states that U-net CNN
structures have excellent performances on the segmentation task, more training
data increases network performance and utilizing transfer learning enables
networks to generalize to new data better.
  To validate these findings in the literature two experiments are conducted.
The first experiment trains a network on data sets of different size. The
second experiment proposes twelve network structures and trains them on the
same data set. The experimental results support the findings in the literature.
The FCN16 and FCN32 networks perform best in the accuracy, intersection over

segmentation network is a fully convolutional structure with a skip
architecture and an encoder depth of either one or two. Weights of this network
should be initialized using transfer learning from the pre trained VGG16

demonstrate that the interfacial magnetism is induced by the MPE on the surface

collectively moving preys and the emerging patterns of their escape
trajectories still remain elusive. In this paper, we investigate how the range
of cooperative interactions within a prey group affects the survival chances of
the group while chased by a predator. As observed in nature, the interaction
range of preys may vary due to their vision, age, or even physical structure.
Based on a simple theoretical prey-predator model, here, we show that an
optimality criterion for the survival can be established on the interaction
range of preys. Very short range or long range interactions are shown to be
inefficient for the escape mechanism. Interestingly, for an intermediate range
of interaction, survival probability of the prey group is found to be maximum.
Our analysis also shows that the nature of the escape trajectories strongly
depends on the range of interactions between preys and corroborates with the
naturally observed escape patterns. Moreover, we find that the optimal survival
regime depends on the prey group size and also on the predator strength.

conservative discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (DG). Previous
applications of DG to the compressible reacting Navier-Stokes equations
required nonconservative fluxes or stabilization methods in order to suppress
unphysical oscillations in pressure that led to the failure of simple test
cases. In this paper, we demonstrate that material interfaces with a
temperature discontinuity result in numerical unphysical pressure oscillations
if the species internal energy is nonlinear with respect to temperature. We
demonstrate that a temperature discontinuity is the only type of material
interface that results in unphysical pressure oscillations for a conservative
discretization of the total energy formulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that unphysical pressure oscillations will be generated at any material
interface, including material interfaces with at which the temperature is
continuous, if the thermodynamics are frozen during the temporal integration of
the conserved state. Additionally, we demonstrate that the oscillations are
amplified if the specific heat at constant pressure is incorrectly evaluated
directly from the NASA polynomial expressions. Instead, the mean value, which
we derive in this manuscript, should be used to compute the specific heat at
constant pressure. This can reduce the amplitude of, but not prevent,
unphysical oscillations where the species concentrations numerically mix. We
then present solutions to several test cases using the total energy formulation
and demonstrate spurious pressure oscillations were not generated for material
interfaces if the temperature is continuous and that it is better behaved than
frozen thermodynamic formulations if the temperature is discontinuous.

differing weather conditions, seasonal changes, and construction sites. Second,
we show that the proposed approach clearly outperforms a recently published

  Parcet","Noncommutative strong maximals and almost uniform convergence in several
  directions","38 pages",,,,"math.FA math.CA math.OA math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Our first result is a noncommutative form of Jessen/Marcinkiewicz/Zygmund
theorem for the maximal limit of multiparametric martingales or ergodic means.
It implies bilateral almost uniform convergence with initial data in the
expected Orlicz spaces. A key ingredient is the introduction of the $L_p$-norm
of the $\limsup$ of a sequence of operators as a localized version of a
$\ell_\infty/c_0$-valued $L_p$-space. In particular, our main result gives a
strong $L_1$-estimate for the $\limsup$, as opposed to the usual weak
$L_{1,\infty}$-estimate for the $\sup$.
  Let $\mathcal{L} \mathbf{F}_2$ denote the free group algebra and consider the
free Poisson semigroup generated by the usual length function. It is an open
problem to determine the largest class inside $L_1(\mathcal{L} \mathbf{F}_2)$
for which this semigroup converges to the initial data. Currently, the best
known result is $L \log^2 L(\mathcal{L} \mathbf{F}_2)$. We improve this by
adding to it the operators in $L_1(\mathcal{L} \mathbf{F}_2)$ spanned by words
without signs changes. Contrary to other related results in the literature,
this set has exponential growth. The proof relies on our estimates for the
noncommutative $\limsup$ together with new transference techniques.
  We also establish a noncommutative form of C\'ordoba/Feffermann/Guzm\'an
inequality for the strong maximal. More precisely, a weak $(\Phi,\Phi)$
inequality for noncommutative multiparametric martingales and $\Phi(s) = s (1 +
\log_+ s)^{2 + \varepsilon}$. This logarithmic power is an
$\varepsilon$-perturbation of the expected optimal one. The proof combines a
refinement of Cuculescu's construction with a quantum probabilistic
interpretation of de Guzm\'an's argument. The commutative form of our argument
gives the simplest known proof of this classical inequality. A few interesting
consequences are derived for Cuculescu's projections.

from CO molecular lines in the K band. High excitation \ion{C}{i} lines present

originates from a larger sized region that experiences no microlensing. A
simple model employing multiplicative factors for image B due to stellar

result is tightly constrained to the product $m\times M=1.79$. Given the

from Markovian to non-Markovian dynamics is the intrinsic physical reason of
the quantum speed-up process, both of the driving field and the strong coupling
can enhance the non-Markovianity in the dynamics process and speed up the
evolution of the qubit, but the moving velocity of the qubit can decrease the

of the large scale structure of the universe before and during the Epoch of
Reionization, when the first ionizing sources formed. Bright radio emission
from foreground sources remains the biggest obstacle to detecting the faint 21
cm signal. However, the expected smoothness of foreground power leaves a clean
window in Fourier space where the EoR signal can potentially be seen over
thermal noise. Though the boundary of this window is well-defined in principle,
spectral structure in foreground sources, instrumental chromaticity, and choice
of spectral weighting in analysis all affect how much foreground power spills
over into the EoR window. In this paper, we run a suite of numerical
simulations of wide-field visibility measurements, with a variety of diffuse
foreground models and instrument configurations, and measure the extent of
contaminated Fourier modes in the EoR window using a delay-transform approach
to estimating power spectra. We also test these effects with a model of the
HERA antenna beam generated from electromagnetic simulations, to take into
account further chromatic effects in the real instrument. We find that
foreground power spillover is dominated by the so-called ""pitchfork effect"", in
which diffuse foreground power is brightened near the horizon due to the
shortening of baselines. As a result, the extent of contaminated modes in the
EoR window is largely constant over time, except when the galaxy is near the
pointing center.

study magnetotransport between two Fe and Co ferromagnetic electrodes across a
functional magnetic CoPc molecular layer. We observe how spin-flip transport
across CoPc molecular spin chains promotes a specific magnetoresistance effect,

Conditional computation, sparsity, and model pruning techniques can reduce

time of emission and detection can be probed with standard sirens. Here we
discuss the role that Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) and binary pulsar constraints
play in the prospects of constraining $G(t)$ with standard sirens. In
particular, we argue that LLR constrains the matter-matter gravitational
coupling $G_N(t)$, whereas binary pulsars and standard sirens constrain the
quadratic kinetic gravity self-interaction $G_{gw}(t)$. Generically, these two
couplings could be different in alternative cosmological models, in which case
LLR constraints are irrelevant for standard sirens. We use the Hulse-Taylor
pulsar data and show that observations are highly insensitive to time
variations of $G_{gw}(t)$ yet highly sensitive to $G_N(t)$. We thus conclude
that future gravitational waves data will become the best probe to test
$G_{gw}(t)$, and will hence provide novel constraints on dynamical dark energy

swelling of the brush causing changes in the brush topography and wettability.
The liquid may also advance within the brush via diffusion (or wicking)

Virgo cluster, the GW signals can be detected by the detectors at quite high

constrained at about $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$, which is more than one order of
magnitude tighter than the potential constraint given by ground-based Einstein
telescope. However, for the EMRIs consisting of a massive black hole and a
white dwarf, it is more difficult to be detected than the previous case. For
the specific SMG models, including chameleon, symmetron and dilaton, we find
these constraints are complementary with that from Cassini experiment, but
weaker than those from lunar laser ranging observations and binary pulsars, due
to the strong gravitational potentials on the surface of neutron stars. By
analyzing the deviation of GW waveform in SMG from that in general relativity,
as anticipated, we find the dominant contribution of the SMG constraining comes
from the correction terms in the GW phases, rather than the extra polarization

lower during daytime when covered with our thermal emitter, reaching an average

cooling power density of this rather simple radiative cooler under direct

cool down electronic devices, such as solar cells, where an increase in

less attention. We propose the new AQM scheduler cocoa based on fair queuing,
which adapts the buffer size depending on the needs of each flow without
requiring active participation from the endpoint. We implement this scheduler
for the Linux kernel and show that it interacts well with the most common
congestion control algorithms and can significantly increase throughput
compared to fair CoDel while avoiding overbuffering.

models in a way that makes them more suitable for adaptation to test

by having a set of speaker dependent parameters that are jointly optimised with
speaker independent parameters in order to remove speaker variation. However,
this does not scale well if all neural network weights are to be adapted to the

simultaneously by solving an implicit equation, we have obtained unprecedented
accuracy across a wide range of parameter values. Using this method, the

always a single limit cycle due to the quantum tunneling effect. We use a

agencies face the aforementioned challenges while using factor-based models to
estimate AADT. To derive a more accurate AADT, this paper presents the

AADT at a particular location from the short-term counts collected at those

permutes symbols of a text according to the lexicographical order of its
suffixes. BWT is the main component of popular lossless compression programs
(such as bzip2) as well as recent powerful compressed indexes (such as
$r$-index [Gagie et al., J. ACM, 2020]), central in modern bioinformatics. The
compression ratio of BWT is quantified by the number $r$ of equal-letter runs.
Despite the practical significance of BWT, no non-trivial bound on the value of
$r$ is known. This is in contrast to nearly all other known compression
methods, whose sizes have been shown to be either always within a ${\rm
polylog}\,n$ factor (where $n$ is the length of text) from $z$, the size of
Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) parsing of the text, or significantly larger in the worst
case (by a $n^{\varepsilon}$ factor for $\varepsilon > 0$). In this paper, we
show that $r = \mathcal{O}(z \log^2n)$ holds for every text. This result has
numerous implications for text indexing and data compression; for example: (1)
it proves that many results related to BWT automatically apply to methods based
on LZ77, e.g., it is possible to obtain functionality of the suffix tree in
$\mathcal{O}(z\,{\rm polylog}\,n)$ space; (2) it shows that many text
processing tasks can be solved in the optimal time assuming the text is
compressible using LZ77 by a sufficiently large ${\rm polylog}\,n$ factor; (3)
it implies the first non-trivial relation between the number of runs in the BWT
of the text and its reverse. In addition, we provide an $\mathcal{O}(z\,{\rm
polylog}\,n)$-time algorithm converting the LZ77 parsing into the run-length
compressed BWT. To achieve this, we develop a number of new data structures and
techniques of independent interest.

rigorous proof of the remarkable fact that the canonical Wiener-Hopf

monodromy matrix, with respect to an appropriately chosen contour, yields a
solution to the non-linear gravitational field equations. This holds regardless
of whether the dimensionally reduced metric in two dimensions has Minkowski or
Euclidean signature. We show moreover that, by taking advantage of a certain
degree of freedom in the choice of the contour, the same monodromy matrix
generally yields various distinct solutions to the field equations. Our proof,
which fills various gaps in the existing literature, is based on the solution
of a second Riemann-Hilbert problem and highlights the deep role of the
spectral curve, the normalization condition in the factorization and the choice
of the contour. This approach allows us to construct explicit solutions,
including new ones, to the non-linear gravitational field equations, using

ground station locations is dependent on the satellite orbit and other
satellite visibility constraints. The ground station location optimization is
especially important when MTSV is improved by orthogonal time sharing schemes
using multiple satellites on the same or different orbits. Similar conclusions
can be drawn assuming other performance metrics such as the capacity of links

have either of two critical issues: spectrum or metric mismatches. The spectrum
mismatch is a well known issue that any spectrum modification after short-time
Fourier transform (STFT), in general, cannot be fully recovered after inverse
short-time Fourier transform (ISTFT). The metric mismatch is that a
conventional mean square error (MSE) loss function is typically sub-optimal to
maximize perceptual speech measure such as signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR),
perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) and short-time objective
intelligibility (STOI). This paper presents a new end-to-end denoising
framework. First, the network optimization is performed on the time-domain
signals after ISTFT to avoid the spectrum mismatch. Second, three loss
functions based on SDR, PESQ and STOI are proposed to minimize the metric
mismatch. The experimental result showed the proposed denoising scheme
significantly improved SDR, PESQ and STOI performance over the existing
methods. Moreover, the proposed scheme also provided good generalization
performance over generative denoising models on the perceptual speech metrics

mechanics (QM). If measurement is governed by wavefunction collapse, then
gedanken experiments show that a number of fundamental principles including
conservation of angular momentum and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle can
be violated. We conclude that the collapse of the spin part of the wavefunction
cannot happen and therefore an EPR paradox does not arise for this system. QM
unitarity alone is sufficient to rule out ""spooky"" action at a distance. The
absence of spin wavefunction collapse leads to several interesting conclusions
about how measurement works in QM: When wavefunction collapse does not happen,
(i) a signal from a macroscopic measuring device indicating that a system is in
a state S does not necessarily mean that it is or was in S and (ii) the
uncertainty in QM at the microscopic level is transmitted to uncertainty in
signals for the macroscopic measuring device. We derive two general results on
how quantum measurement works and illustrate them in a spin-1/2 measurement. In
contrast to first-quantized QM, in quantum field theory we are unable to fully
rule out the possibility of wavefunction collapse. However, when we insist on
unitarity (thereby excluding the possibility of wavefunction collapse) and
additionally take into account in the wavefunction all degrees of freedom
involved in the measurement (including those of the equipment,
experimentalists, etc.), a consistant acceptable understanding of the
Bell-inequality-type experiments involving entangled photon polarizations
emerges including the absence of an EPR paradox. The ability of an
experimentalist to be aware of his perceptions but unable to be conscious of
other components of a generalized Schrodinger Cat plays a role in resolving the
Measurement Problem.

three completely depolarizing channels in superposition of different causal
orders. We thus introduce the quantum 3-switch as a resource for quantum
communications. We perform a new kind of quantum control that was not
accessible to the previously treated two-channel case. The fine and full
quantum control achieved using selected combinations of causal orders let us
uncover new features: non monotonous behavior on the transmission of
information with respect to the number of causal orders involved, and different
values of the transmission of information depending on the specific
combinations of causal orders considered. Our results are a stepping stone to
assess efficiency of coherent quantum control and optimize resources in the
implementation of new indefinite causal structures. Finally, we suggest an
optical implementation using standard telecom technology to test our
predictions.

applications on a smart device make the applications more user-friendly and
efficient. However, the current permission-based sensor management systems of
smart devices only focus on certain sensors and any App can get access to other
sensors by just accessing the generic sensor Application Programming Interface
(API). In this way, attackers can exploit these sensors in numerous ways: they
can extract or leak users' sensitive information, transfer malware, or record
or steal sensitive information from other nearby devices. In this paper, we
propose 6thSense, a context-aware intrusion detection system which enhances the
security of smart devices by observing changes in sensor data for different
tasks of users and creating a contextual model to distinguish benign and
malicious behavior of sensors. 6thSense utilizes three different Machine
Learning-based detection mechanisms (i.e., Markov Chain, Naive Bayes, and LMT).
We implemented 6thSense on several sensor-rich Android-based smart devices
(i.e., smart watch and smartphone) and collected data from typical daily
activities of 100 real users. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of
6thSense against three sensor-based threats: (1) a malicious App that can be
triggered via a sensor, (2) a malicious App that can leak information via a
sensor, and (3) a malicious App that can steal data using sensors. Our
extensive evaluations show that the 6thSense framework is an effective and
practical approach to defeat growing sensor-based threats with an accuracy
above 96% without compromising the normal functionality of the device.
Moreover, our framework reveals minimal overhead.

inter-communicate and perform transactions automatically. The execution of
smart contracts is paid in the form of gas, which is a monetary unit used in
the Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) provides the
metering capability for smart contract execution. Instruction costs vary
depending on the instruction type and the approximate computational resources
required to execute the instruction on the network. The cost of gas is adjusted
using transaction fees to ensure adequate payment of the network. In this work,
we highlight the ""real"" economics of smart contracts. We show that the actual
costs of executing smart contracts are disproportionate to the computational
costs and that this gap is continuously widening. We show that the gas
cost-model of the underlying EVM instruction-set is wrongly modeled.
Specifically, the computational cost for the SLOAD instruction increases with
the length of the blockchain. Our proposed performance model estimates gas
usage and execution time of a smart contract at a given block-height. The new
gas-cost model incorporates the block-height to eliminate irregularities in the
Ethereum gas calculations. Our findings are based on extensive experiments over

the map in the position domain, we store the map parameters in the discrete

in space a lidar decay rate, which models the local permeability of the space
for laser rays. In this way, the map can describe objects of different laser
permeabilities, from completely opaque to completely transparent. DCT maps
represent lidar measurements significantly more accurate than grid maps,
Gaussian process occupancy maps, and Hilbert maps, all with the same memory
requirements, as demonstrated in our real-world experiments.

apply this method to several GW detecting projects, including Advanced

aLIGO and ET is of bad accuracy, while the $H(z)$ by DECIGO shows a good one.
We simulate $H(z)$ data at every 0.1 redshift span using the error information
of $H(z)$ by DECIGO, and put the mock data into the forecasting of cosmological
parameters. Compared with the previous data and method, we get an obviously
tighter constraint on cosmological parameters by mock data, and a concomitantly
higher value of Figure of Merit(FoM, the reciprocal of the area enclosed by the

training and using processes. To address this problem, we propose a
privacy-preserving method for the distributed system, Stochastic Channel-Based
Federated Learning (SCBF), which enables the participants to train a
high-performance model cooperatively without sharing their inputs.
Specifically, we design, implement and evaluate a channel-based update
algorithm for the central server in a distributed system, which selects the
channels with regard to the most active features in a training loop and uploads
them as learned information from local datasets. A pruning process is applied
to the algorithm based on the validation set, which serves as a model
accelerator. In the experiment, our model presents better performances and
higher saturating speed than the Federated Averaging method which reveals all
the parameters of local models to the server when updating. We also demonstrate
that the saturating rate of performance could be promoted by introducing a
pruning process. And further improvement could be achieved by tuning the
pruning rate. Our experiment shows that 57% of the time is saved by the pruning
process with only a reduction of 0.0047 in AUCROC performance and a reduction
of 0.0068 in AUCPR.

but effective method is proposed for automatic arm motion recognition with a
Doppler radar sensor. Arms, in lieu of hands, have stronger radar cross-section
and can be recognized from relatively longer distances. An energy-based
thresholding algorithm is applied to the spectrograms to extract the
micro-Doppler (MD) signature envelopes. The positive and negative frequency
envelopes are concatenated to form a feature vector. The nearest neighbor (NN)
classifier with Manhattan distance (L1) is then used to recognize the arm
motions. It is shown that this simple method yields classification accuracy
above 97 percent for six classes of arm motions. Despite its simplicity, the
proposed method is superior to those of handcrafted featurebased
classifications and low-dimension representation techniques based on principal
component analysis (PCA), and is comparable to convolutional neural network
(CNN).

Unlike conventional methods that are usually time-consuming and require human

a robust framework to build a damage prediction model for building structures.
Support vector machines are used to predict the existence as well as the
probable location of the damage. The model is designed to consider
probabilistic approaches in determining hazard intensity given the existing
attenuation models in performance-based earthquake engineering. Performance of
the model regarding accurate and safe predictions is enhanced using Bayesian
optimization. The proposed framework is evaluated on a reinforced concrete
moment frame. Targeting a selected large earthquake scenario, 6,240 nonlinear

engineered to extract low-dimensional intensity-based features that can be used
