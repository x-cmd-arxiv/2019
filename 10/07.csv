phenomena. The electromagnetic power flux density is usually expressed with the
Poynting vector. However, since Poynting theorem basically focuses on the power
balance in a system, it is not so efficient in some situations to use it for
evaluating the electromagnetic energies. The energy balance issue for time

trivial $k$-approximation. In this paper, we present another
$3/2$-approximation for our cardinality {\sc $3$-BGP} and then extend it to
become a $k/2$-approximation for {\sc $k$-BGP}, for any constant $k \ge 3$.

  Networks",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In network data analysis, it is becoming common to work with a collection of
graphs that exhibit \emph{heterogeneity}. For example, neuroimaging data from
patient cohorts are increasingly available. A critical analytical task is to
identify communities, and graph Laplacian-based methods are routinely used.
However, these methods are currently limited to a single network and do not
provide measures of uncertainty on the community assignment. In this work, we
propose a probabilistic network model called the ``Spiked Laplacian Graph''
that considers each network as an invertible transform of the Laplacian, with
its eigenvalues modeled by a modified spiked structure. This effectively
reduces the number of parameters in the eigenvectors, and their sign patterns
allow efficient estimation of the community structure. Further, the posterior
distribution of the eigenvectors provides uncertainty quantification for the
community estimates. Subsequently, we introduce a Bayesian non-parametric
approach to address the issue of heterogeneity in a collection of graphs.
Theoretical results are established on the posterior consistency of the
procedure and provide insights on the trade-off between model resolution and
accuracy. We illustrate the performance of the methodology on synthetic data
sets, as well as a neuroscience study related to brain activity in working
memory.

drop-off patrons at airport and rail terminals. Vehicles are prohibited from
overtaking each other within the lane. They must therefore wait in a
first-in-first-out queue during busy periods. Patrons are often discharged from
vehicles only upon reaching a desired drop-off area near the terminal entrance.
When wait times grow long, however, some vehicles discharge their patrons in
advance of that desired area. A train station in Eastern China is selected as a
case study. Its FIFO drop-off lane is presently managed by policemen who allow
taxis to enter the lane in batched fashion. Inefficiencies are observed because
curb space near the terminal often goes unused. This is true even when
supplemental batches of taxis are released into the lane in efforts to fill
those spaces. A microscopic simulation model of a FIFO drop-off lane is
developed in-house, and is painstakingly calibrated to data measured at the
study site. Simulation experiments indicate that rescinding the FIFO lane's
present batching strategy can increase taxi outflow by more than 26 percent.
Further experiments show that even greater gains can be achieved by batching
taxis, but requiring them to discharge patrons when forced by downstream queues
to stop a prescribed distance in advance of a desired drop-off area. Further
gains were predicted by requiring the lead taxi in each batch to discharge its
patron only after travelling a prescribed distance beyond a desired location.
Practical implications are discussed in light of the present boom in
shared-ride services.

properties by a noisy amplitude-based phase retrieval problem, the latter being
of much topical interest.Derived from available data via sampling, these
empirical risk minimization problems are the computational workhorse of a
population risk model which involves the minimization of an expected value of a
random functional. When these minimization problems are nonconvex, the
computation of their globally optimal solutions is elusive. Together with the
fact that the expectation operator cannot be evaluated for general probability
distributions, it becomes necessary to justify whether the stationary solutions
of the empirical problems are practical approximations of the stationary
solution of the population problem. When these two features, general
distribution and nonconvexity, are coupled with nondifferentiability that often
renders the problems ""non-Clarke regular"", the task of the justification
becomes challenging. Our work aims to address such a challenge within an
algorithm-free setting. The resulting analysis is therefore different from the

algorithms. Furthermore, supplementing the classical minimizer-centric

theorems, all for open sets given by their (third-order) characteristic
functions. Regarding computability theory, the objects claimed to exist by the
aforementioned theorems undergo a shift from `computable' to `not computable in
any type two functional', following Kleene's S1-S9. Regarding Reverse
Mathematics, the latter's so-called Main Question, namely which set existence
axioms are necessary for proving a given theorem, does not have a unique or
unambiguous answer for the aforementioned theorems, working in Kohlenbach's
higher-order framework. A finer study of representations of open sets leads to
the new `$\Delta$-functional' which has unique (computational) properties.

beyond existing visual and visual-inertial SLAM libraries (e.g., ORB-SLAM,

a visual-inertial odometry (VIO) module for fast and accurate state estimation,
a robust pose graph optimizer for global trajectory estimation, a lightweight
3D mesher module for fast mesh reconstruction, and a dense 3D metric-semantic
reconstruction module. The modules can be run in isolation or in combination,
hence Kimera can easily fall back to a state-of-the-art VIO or a full SLAM
system. Kimera runs in real-time on a CPU and produces a 3D metric-semantic
mesh from semantically labeled images, which can be obtained by modern deep
learning methods. We hope that the flexibility, computational efficiency,
robustness, and accuracy afforded by Kimera will build a solid basis for future
metric-semantic SLAM and perception research, and will allow researchers across
multiple areas (e.g., VIO, SLAM, 3D reconstruction, segmentation) to benchmark

is based on convolutional neural networks which represent a powerful tool for
identifying characteristic perturbations in spatial maps of stellar number

develop a robust and computationally efficient algorithm, capable of generating
mock stellar fields from an arbitrary underlying phase-space distribution of

in a disordered porous medium: hopping-and-trapping motility, in which cells
perform rapid, directed hops punctuated by intervals of slow, undirected
trapping. Here, we use direct visualization to shed light on how these
processes depend on pore-scale confinement and cellular activity. We find that
hopping is determined by pore-scale confinement, and is independent of cellular

pore-scale confinement and cellular activity, as predicted by an entropic
trapping model. These results thus help to elucidate the factors that regulate
bacterial motion in porous media, and could help aid the development of new

Analysis (EGRA) method, which is a surrogate-based method that uses adaptive
sampling for refining Gaussian process surrogates for failure boundary location
using a single-fidelity model. Our method introduces a two-stage adaptive
sampling criterion that uses a multifidelity Gaussian process surrogate to
leverage multiple information sources with different fidelities. The method
combines expected feasibility criterion from EGRA with one-step lookahead
information gain to refine the surrogate around the failure boundary. The
computational savings from mfEGRA depends on the discrepancy between the
different models, and the relative cost of evaluating the different models as
compared to the high-fidelity model. We show that accurate estimation of
reliability using mfEGRA leads to computational savings of $\sim$46% for an
analytic multimodal test problem and 24% for a three-dimensional acoustic horn
problem, when compared to single-fidelity EGRA. We also show the effect of
using a priori drawn Monte Carlo samples in the implementation for the acoustic
horn problem, where mfEGRA leads to computational savings of 45% for the
three-dimensional case and 48% for a rarer event four-dimensional case as

a method for detecting magnetic fields in the atmospheres of close-in
exoplanets based on spectropolarimetric transit observations at the wavelength
of the helium line at 1083 nm. This methodology has been successfully applied
before for exploring magnetic fields in solar coronal filaments. Strong
absorption signatures (transit depths on the order of a few percent) in the
1083 nm line have recently been observed for several close-in exoplanets. We
show that in the conditions in these escaping atmospheres, metastable helium
atoms should be optically pumped by the starlight and, for field strengths more
than a few $\times 10^{-4}$ G, should align with the magnetic field. This
results in linearly polarized absorption at 1083 nm that traces the field
direction (the Hanle effect), which we explore by both analytic computation and
with the Hazel numerical code. The linear polarization $\sqrt{Q^2+U^2}/I$
ranges from $\sim 10^{-3}$ in optimistic cases down to a few $\times 10^{-5}$
for particularly unfavorable cases, with very weak dependence on field
strength. The line-of-sight component of the field results in a slight circular
polarization (the Zeeman effect), also reaching $V/I\sim {\rm few}\times
10^{-5}(B_\parallel/10\,{\rm G})$. We discuss the detectability of these
signals with current (SPIRou) and future (extremely large telescope)

network into low-dimensional pre-specified features prior to applying standard
predictive algorithms. These methods are sensitive to feature choice and
inevitably discard important information. Instead, we propose a nonparametric

region connections to adaptively detect predictive algorithms, while
maintaining interpretability. The Bayesian Connectomics (BaCon) model class
utilizes Poisson-Dirichlet processes to find a lower-dimensional, bidirectional

fine-tuning a network on a mixture of new and old instances. While there is
neuroscientific evidence that the brain replays compressed memories, existing
methods for convolutional networks replay raw images. Here, we propose REMIND,
a brain-inspired approach that enables efficient replay with compressed
representations. REMIND is trained in an online manner, meaning it learns one
example at a time, which is closer to how humans learn. Under the same
constraints, REMIND outperforms other methods for incremental class learning on
the ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 dataset. We probe REMIND's robustness to data ordering
schemes known to induce catastrophic forgetting. We demonstrate REMIND's
generality by pioneering online learning for Visual Question Answering (VQA).

used in the semiconductor industry for printing circuitry in the sub-20 nm
scale. Low-energy electrons (LEEs) produced upon illumination of resist
materials with EUV photons (92 eV) play a central role in the formation of the
nanopatterns. However, up to now the details of this process are not well
understood. In this work, a novel experimental approach that combines
Low-Energy Electron Microscopy (LEEM), Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy
(EELS), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is used to study changes induced by
electrons in the 0-40 eV range in thin films of molecular organometallic EUV
resists known as tin-oxo cages. LEEM-EELS spectroscopic experiments were used
to detect surface charging upon electron exposure and to estimate the electron
landing energy. AFM post-exposure analyses revealed that irradiation of the
resist with LEEs leads to the densification of the resist layer associated to
carbon loss. The same chemical processes that yield densification render the
solubility change responsible for the pattern formation in the lithographic
application. Remarkably, electrons as low as 1.2 eV are able to induce chemical
reactions in the Sn-based resist. Based on the thickness profiles resulting
from LEE exposures in the 3-48 mC/cm 2 dose range, a simplified reaction model
is proposed where the resist undergoes sequential chemical reactions, yielding
first a sparsely cross-linked network, followed by the formation of a denser
cross-linked network. This model allows us to estimate a maximum reaction
volume on the initial material of 0.15 nm 3 per incident electron in the energy
range studied, which means that less than 10 LEEs per molecule on average are
needed to turn the material insoluble and thus render a pattern.

White-box test generation is a technique used for automatically
selecting test inputs using only the source or binary code. However, such
techniques encounter challenges when applying them to complex programs. One of
the main challenges is handling the dependencies of the unit under test.
  Objective. Without proper actions, generated tests cannot cover all parts of
the source code, or calling the dependencies may cause unexpected side effects
(e.g., file system or network access). These issues should be tackled while
maintaining the advantages of white-box test generation.
  Method. In this paper, we present an automated source code transformation
approach tackling the dependency issue for white-box test generation. This
technique isolates the test execution by creating a parameterized sandbox
wrapped around the transformed unit. We implemented the approach in a
ready-to-use tool using Microsoft Pex as a test generator, and evaluated it on
10 open-source projects from GitHub having more than 38.000 lines of code in
total.
  Results. The results from the evaluation indicate that if the lack of
isolation hinders white-box test generation, then our approach is able to help:
it increases the code coverage reached by the automatically generated test,
while it reduces unwanted side effects. Also, our results act as a unique
baseline for the test generation performance of Microsoft Pex on open-source
projects.
  Conclusion. Based on the results, our source code transformations might serve
well for alleviating the isolation problem in white-box test generation as it
increases the coverage reached in such situations, while maintaining the
practical applicability of the tests generated on the isolated code.

are characteristics of the system such as energy consumed or increase in time

Additionally, the objectives are often mutually exclusive -- leading to a

a combination of the objectives. This work is an application of a Genetic
Algorithm to identify the Pareto frontier for finding the optimal parameter
sets for all combinations of objectives. A Pareto frontier can be used to
identify the sets of optimal parameters for which each is the `best' for a

understanding how animals handle uncertainty about learned associations, using

The cores are generally invisible in optical bands because of extinction, and
they are also indistinct at 8 microns alone because of contamination by more
widespread diffuse emission. Several hundred core positions, magnitudes, and
colors from the four IRAC bands are measured and tabulated for each galaxy. The
larger galaxies, which tend to have longer and more regular spiral arms, often
have their infrared cores aligned along these arms, with additional cores in
spiral arm spurs. Galaxies without regular spirals have their cores in more
irregular spiral-like filaments, with typically only one or two cores per
filament. Nearly every elongated emission feature has 8 micron cores strung out
along its length. The occurrence of dense cores in long and thin filaments is
reminiscent of filamentary star formation in the solar neighborhood, although
on a scale 100 times larger in galaxies. The cores most likely form by
gravitational instabilities and cloud agglomeration in the filaments. The
simultaneous occurrence of several cores with regular spacings in some spiral
arms suggests that in these cases, all of the cores formed at about the same
time and the corresponding filaments are young. Total star formation rates for
the galaxies correlate with the total embedded stellar masses in the cores with
an average ratio corresponding to a possible age between 0.2 Myr and 2 Myr.
This suggests that the identified cores are the earliest phase for most star
formation.

small number of synthetic samples containing all the information of a large
dataset. This has several benefits like speeding up model training, reducing
energy consumption, and reducing required storage space. Currently, each
synthetic sample is assigned a single `hard' label, and also, dataset
distillation can currently only be used with image data.
  We propose to simultaneously distill both images and their labels, thus
assigning each synthetic sample a `soft' label (a distribution of labels). Our
algorithm increases accuracy by 2-4% over the original algorithm for several
image classification tasks. Using `soft' labels also enables distilled datasets
to consist of fewer samples than there are classes as each sample can encode
information for multiple classes. For example, training a LeNet model with 10
distilled images (one per class) results in over 96% accuracy on MNIST, and
almost 92% accuracy when trained on just 5 distilled images.
  We also extend the dataset distillation algorithm to distill sequential
datasets including texts. We demonstrate that text distillation outperforms
other methods across multiple datasets. For example, models attain almost their
original accuracy on the IMDB sentiment analysis task using just 20 distilled
sentences.

nearly impossible to obtain large quantities of labeled data for every domain
we are interested in. This necessitates the use of domain adaptation
strategies. One common strategy encourages generalization by aligning the
global distribution statistics between source and target domains, but one
drawback is that the statistics of different domains or tasks are inherently
divergent, and smoothing over these differences can lead to sub-optimal
performance. In this paper, we propose the framework of {\it Domain
Differential Adaptation (DDA)}, where instead of smoothing over these
differences we embrace them, directly modeling the difference between domains
using models in a related task. We then use these learned domain differentials
to adapt models for the target task accordingly. Experimental results on domain
adaptation for neural machine translation demonstrate the effectiveness of this
strategy, achieving consistent improvements over other alternative adaptation
strategies in multiple experimental settings.

action decisions based on the anticipated outcomes. Video prediction systems
have been demonstrated as a solution for predicting how the future will unfold
visually, and thus, many models have been proposed that are capable of
predicting future frames based on a history of observed frames~(and sometimes
robot actions). However, a comprehensive method for determining the fitness of
different video prediction models at guiding the selection of actions is yet to
be developed. Current metrics assess video prediction models based on human
perception of frame quality. In contrast, we argue that if these systems are to
be used to guide action, necessarily, the actions the robot performs should be
encoded in the predicted frames. In this paper, we are proposing a new metric
to compare different video prediction models based on this argument. More
specifically, we propose an action inference system and quantitatively rank
different models based on how well we can infer the robot actions from the
predicted frames. Our extensive experiments show that models with high
perceptual scores can perform poorly in the proposed action inference tests and
thus, may not be suitable options to be used in robot planning systems.

Models (GMMs). Our starting point is the SigClust method developed by Liu et
al. (2008), which introduces a test based on the k-means objective (with k = 2)
to decide whether the data should be split into two clusters. When applied
recursively, this test yields a method for hierarchical clustering that is
equipped with a significance guarantee. We study the limiting distribution and
power of this approach in some examples and show that there are large regions
of the parameter space where the power is low. We then introduce a new test
based on the idea of relative fit. Unlike prior work, we test for whether a
mixture of Gaussians provides a better fit relative to a single Gaussian,
without assuming that either model is correct. The proposed test has a simple
critical value and provides provable error control. One version of our test
provides exact, finite sample control of the type I error. We show how our
tests can be used for hierarchical clustering as well as in a sequential manner
for model selection. We conclude with an extensive simulation study and a
cluster analysis of a gene expression dataset.

applications in cryptography and hardness of approximation. An important open
problem is characterizing the power of no-signaling proofs. It is known that

proofs with $poly(n)$-provers are characterized by EXP. However, the power of
$k$-prover no-signaling proofs, for $2<k<poly(n)$ remained an open problem.
  We show that $k$-prover no-signaling proofs (with negligible soundness) for
$k=O(\sqrt{\log n})$ are contained in PSPACE. We prove this via two different
routes that are of independent interest. In both routes we consider a
relaxation of no-signaling called sub-no-signaling. Our main technical
contribution (which is used in both our proofs) is a reduction showing how to
convert any sub-no-signaling strategy with value at least $1-2^{-\Omega(k^2)}$

  In the first route, we show that the classical prover reduction method for
converting $k$-prover games into $2$-prover games carries over to the
no-signaling setting with the following loss in soundness: if a $k$-player game
has value less than $2^{-ck^2}$ (for some constant~$c>0$), then the
corresponding 2-prover game has value at most $1 - 2^{dk^2}$ (for some
constant~$d>0$). In the second route we show that the value of a
sub-no-signaling game can be approximated in space that is polynomial in the
communication complexity and exponential in the number of provers.

systems from the forthcoming LSST survey, we have successfully reconstructed
the distance ratio $\mathcal{D}_{\rm obs}$ (with the source redshift $z_s\sim
4.0$), directly from the data without assuming any parametric form. A recently
developed method based on model-independent reconstruction approach, Gaussian
Processes (GP) is used in our study of these strong lensing systems. Our
results show that independent measurement of the matter density parameter
($\Omega_m$) could be expected from such strong lensing statistics. More
specifically, one can expect $\Omega_m$ to be estimated at the precision of
$\Delta\Omega_m\sim0.015$ in the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model, which provides
comparable constraint on $\Omega_m$ with Planck 2015 results. In the framework
of the modified gravity theory (DGP), 390 detectable galactic lenses from

\textbf{Finally, we have discussed three possible sources of systematic errors
(sample incompleteness, the determination of length of lens redshift bin, and
the choice of lens redshift shells), and quantified their effects on the final
cosmological constraints. Our results strongly indicate that future strong
lensing surveys, with the accumulation of a larger and more accurate sample of
detectable galactic lenses, will considerably benefit from the methodology

practically neglected. In this study, we considered the effect of the
pre-existing fluid, when its viscosity is non-negligible, in a horizontally

of capillary rise. We observed the dynamics when a capillary tube that is
submerged horizontally in a liquid gets in contact with a second liquid. An
appropriate combination of liquids allowed us to observe that the second liquid
replaces the first without any prewetting process, thanks to a careful cleaning
of capillary tubes. Furthermore, we experimentally observed three distinct
viscous dynamics: (i) the conventional slowing-down dynamics, (ii) an unusual
accelerating dynamics, and (iii) another unusual dynamics, which is linear in
time. We developed a theory in viscous regimes, which accounts well for the
observations through a unified expression describing the three distinct
dynamics. We also demonstrated a thorough experimental confirmation on the
initial velocity of the replacement. We further focused on the replacement
time, the time required for the invading fluid to replaces completely the
pre-existing fluid in the horizontal geometry, which is again well explained by
the theory.

systems Ax = b based on the Lanczos biorthogonalization process defined by

Whereas the BiCG (Fletcher, 1976), CGS (Sonneveld, 1989) and BiCGSTAB (van der
Vorst, 1992) iterates may not exist when the tridiagonal projection of A is
singular, BiLQ is reliable on compatible systems even if A is ill-conditioned
or rank deficient. As in the symmetric case, the BiCG residual is often smaller
than the BiLQ residual and, when the BiCG iterate exists, an inexpensive
transfer from the BiLQ iterate is possible. Although the Euclidean norm of the
BiLQ error is usually not monotonic, it is monotonic in a different norm that
depends on the Lanczos vectors. We establish a similar property for the QMR
(Freund and Nachtigal, 1991) residual. BiLQ combines with QMR to take advantage
of two initial vectors and solve a system and an adjoint system simultaneously
at a cost similar to that of applying either method. We derive an analogous
combination of USYMLQ and USYMQR based on the orthogonal tridiagonalization
process (Saunders, Simon, and Yip, 1988). The resulting combinations, named
BiLQR and TriLQR, may be used to estimate integral functionals involving the
solution of a primal and an adjoint system. We compare BiLQR and TriLQR with
Minres-qlp on a related augmented system, which performs a comparable amount of
work and requires comparable storage. In our experiments, BiLQR terminates

show chirality among three vectors, i.e. the film normal direction, applied

we extract a DMI constant of 16~$\mu$J/m$^{2}$ which we independently confirm
by Brillouin light scattering. Thickness-dependent measurements reveal that the
DMI originates from the oxide interface between the YIG and garnet substrate.

critical domains, where calibrated, robust, and efficient measures of

non-Bayesian NNs to estimate a continuous target as well as its associated
evidence in order to learn both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. We
accomplish this by placing evidential priors over the original Gaussian
likelihood function and training the NN to infer the hyperparameters of the
evidential distribution. We additionally impose priors during training such
that the model is regularized when its predicted evidence is not aligned with
the correct output. Our method does not rely on sampling during inference or on
out-of-distribution (OOD) examples for training, thus enabling efficient and
scalable uncertainty learning. We demonstrate learning well-calibrated measures
of uncertainty on various benchmarks, scaling to complex computer vision tasks,
as well as robustness to adversarial and OOD test samples.

superconducting transition accompanied by a structural phase transition above
20 GPa. A topological crystalline insulator (TCI) state is revealed by means of
density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the emergent high-pressure

boundary states protected by crystal symmetry, rather than time reversal. In
consideration of topological surface states (TSSs) and helical spin texture
observed in the high-pressure state of SrAs3, the superconducting state may be
induced in the surface states, and is most likely topologically nontrivial,

shown that Weyl bispinors are algebraically equivalent to two-qubit direct

equivalent to maximally entangled sates (Bell states), with the transformations
relating the two bispinors types acting as entangling gates in quantum

set that fulfills the required properties for Majorana zero mode operators in
topological quantum computation. Based on this set, a general topological
quantum computation model with four Majorana operators is presented, which
exhibits all the required technical and physical properties to obtain

Methods to calculate this quantity have been proposed in several previous

elliptical osculating orbits. When at least one of the two orbits has low
eccentricity, the latter can be used as a small parameter in an asymptotic
power series expansion. The resulting approximation can be exploited to speed
up the computation with negligible cost in terms of accuracy. This contribution
introduces two asymptotic procedures into the SDG-MOID method presented in a

comparisons with previous findings. The best approximate procedure yields a
reduction of 40% in computing speed without degrading the accuracy of the
determinations. This remarkable result suggests that large benefits can be
obtained in applications involving massive distance computations, such as in
the analysis of large databases, in Monte Carlo simulations for impact risk

propose a data-structure called RAMBO (Repeated And Merged BloOm Filter) that
achieves O(\sqrt{K} log K) query time in expectation with an additional
worst-case memory cost factor of O(log K) beyond the array of Bloom Filters.
Due to this, RAMBO is a very fast and accurate data-structure. Apart from being
embarrassingly parallel, supporting cheap updates for streaming inputs, zero
false-negative rate, and low false-positive rate, RAMBO beats the

While most of the recent experiments primarily focus on the electronic-band

out-of-plane thermoelectric measurements across the van der Waals gap in
twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), which exhibits an interplay of twist-dependent
inter-layer electronic and phononic hybridization. We show that at a large
twist angle, the thermopower is entirely driven by a novel phonon drag effect
at the sub-nanometer scale, while the electronic component of the thermopower
is recovered only when the misorientation between the layers is reduced to less

provide fundamental insights into the coherence of electronic states in twisted

background particle physics experiment. The manufactured MS is of type 4A.
$^{226}$Ra and $^{232}$Th have concentrations of about 57 and 198 mBq/kg,
respectively, measured by applying high-purity germanium (HPGe) measurement.
The reduction of the radioactivity from the commercial one is about 99 and 97
percent for $^{226}$Ra and $^{232}$Th, respectively. Furthermore, the radon
emanation rate from MS filter is about 2.1 mBq, which is measured by utilizing
pin-photo type radon detector. This developed MS is expected to remove the
impurity from the noble gas, in which low radioactivity is needed such as dark
matter search experiment.

we report the successful epitaxial thin film growth of the parent compound
strontium bismuthate SrBiO$_3$ on SrO-terminated SrTiO$_3$ (001) substrates by
molecular beam epitaxy. Two different growth methods, high-temperature
co-deposition or recrystallization cycles of low-temperature deposition plus
high-temperature annealing, are developed to improve the epitaxial growth.
SrBiO$_3$ has a pseudocubic lattice constant $\sim$4.25 \AA, an $\sim$8.8\%
lattice mismatch on SrTiO$_3$ substrate, leading to a large strain in the first
few unit cells. Films thicker than 6 unit cells prepared by both methods are
fully relaxed to bulk lattice constant and have similar quality. Compared to
high-temperature co-deposition, the recrystallization method can produce higher
quality 1-6 unit cell films that are coherently or partially strained.
Photoemission experiments reveal the bonding and antibonding states close to
the Fermi level due to Bi and O hybridization, in good agreement with density
functional theory calculations. This work provides general guidance to the
synthesis of high-quality perovskite bismuthate films.

boson-impurity interactions. Such a Bose polaron has recently been predicted to
exhibit an intriguing energy spectrum at finite temperature, where the
ground-state quasiparticle evenly splits into two branches as the temperature
is increased from zero [Guenther et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 050405 (2018)].
To investigate this theoretical prediction, we employ a recently developed
variational approach that systematically includes multi-body correlations
between the impurity and the finite-temperature medium, thus allowing us to go
beyond previous finite-temperature methods. Crucially, we find that the number
of quasiparticle branches is simply set by the number of hole excitations of
the thermal cloud, such that including up to one hole yields one splitting, two
holes yields two splittings, and so on. Moreover, this effect is independent of
the impurity mass. We thus expect that the exact ground-state quasiparticle
will evolve into a single broad peak for temperatures $T>0$, with a broadening
that scales as $T^{3/4}$ at low temperatures and sufficiently weak boson-boson
interactions. In the zero-temperature limit, we show that our calculated
ground-state polaron energy is in excellent agreement with recent quantum Monte
Carlo results and with experiments.

formation in which dense filaments play a crucial role. The detailed
fragmentation properties of star-forming filaments remain poorly understood,
however, and the validity of the filament paradigm in the high-mass regime is
still unclear. To investigate the density/velocity structure of the filament in
the high-mass star-forming region NGC6334, we conducted ALMA observations in
the 3mm continuum and the N2H+(1-0) line at ~3arcsec resolution. The filament
was detected in both tracers. We identified 26 cores at 3mm and 5
velocity-coherent fiber-like features in N2H+ within the filament. The typical
length of, and velocity difference between, the fiber-like features of the
NGC6334 filament are reminiscent of the properties for the fibers of the
low-mass star-forming filament B211/B213. Only 2 or 3 of the 5
velocity-coherent features are well aligned with the filament and may represent
genuine, fiber sub-structures. The core mass distribution has a peak at
~10Msun. They can be divided into 7 groups of cores, closely associated with
ArTeMiS clumps. The projected separation between cores and the projected
spacing between clumps are roughly consistent with the effective Jeans length
in the filament and a physical scale of about 4 times the filament width,
respectively, suggesting a bimodal filament fragmentation process. Despite
being one order of magnitude denser and more massive than the B211/B213
filament, the NGC6334 filament has a similar density/velocity structure. The
difference is that the cores in NGC6334 appear to be an order of magnitude
denser and more massive than the cores in Taurus. This suggests that dense
filaments may evolve and fragment in a similar manner in low- and high-mass
star-forming regions, and that the filament paradigm may hold in the
intermediate-mass (if not high-mass) star formation regime.

anomaly than that of $\chi$. The observation of $A$ reveals an anomaly that

softmax from an information-theoretic perspective. Under this view, we can
naturally and mathematically derive log-softmax as an inherent component in a
neural network for evaluating the conditional mutual information between
network output vectors and labels given an input datum. We show that training
deterministic neural networks through maximising log-softmax is equivalent to
enlarging the conditional mutual information, i.e., feeding label information
into network outputs. We also generalise our informative-theoretic perspective
to neural networks with stochasticity and derive information upper and lower
bounds of log-softmax. In theory, such an information-theoretic view offers
rationality support for embedding softmax in neural networks; in practice, we
eventually demonstrate a computer vision application example of how to employ
our information-theoretic view to filter out targeted objects on images.

A*, passed its pericenter in May 2018. This event is the first chance to detect
the general relativistic (GR) effect of a massive black hole, free from
non-gravitational physics. The observable GR evidence in the event is the
difference between the GR redshift and the Newtonian redshift of photons coming
from S0-2. Within the present observational precision, the 1st post-Newtonian
(1PN) GR evidence is detectable. In this paper, we give a theoretical analysis
of the time evolution of the 1PN GR evidence, under a presupposition that is
different from used in previous papers. Our presupposition is that the
GR/Newtonian redshift is always calculated with the parameter values (the mass
of Sgr A*, the initial conditions of S0-2, and so on) determined by fitting the
GR/Newtonian motion of S0-2 with the observational data. It is then revealed
that the difference of the GR redshift and the Newtonian one shows two peaks
before and after the pericenter passage. This double-peak-appearance is due to
our presupposition, and reduces to a single peak if the same parameter values
are used in both GR and Newtonian redshifts as considered in previous papers.
In addition to this theoretical discussion, we report our observational data
obtained with the Subaru telescope by 2018. The quality and the number of
Subaru data in 2018 are not sufficient to confirm the detection of the
double-peak-appearance.

iterated three-person public-goods game: By a successful strategy, we mean that
it constitutes a cooperative Nash equilibrium under implementation error, with
assuring that the long-term payoff never becomes less than the co-players'
regardless of their strategies, when the error rate is small. Although we have
a list of actions prescribed by each successful strategy, the rationale behind
them has not been fully understood for the iterated public-goods game because
the list has hundreds of entries to deal with every relevant history of
previous interactions. In this paper, we propose a method to convert such
history-based representation into an automaton with a minimal number of states.
Our main finding is that a successful strategy for the iterated three-person
public-goods game can be represented as a $10$-state automaton by this method.
In this automaton, each state can be interpreted as the player's internal
judgement of the situation, such as trustworthiness of the co-players and the
need to redeem oneself after defection. This result thus suggests a
comprehensible way to choose an appropriate action at each step towards
cooperation based on a situational judgement, which is mapped from the history

within the so called L/T transition, have been shown to be variable at higher
amplitudes and with greater frequency than other field dwarfs. [...] Now, more
variables such as these need to be discovered and studied to better constrain
atmospheric models. This is also critical to better understand giant exoplanets
and to shed light on a number of possible correlations between brown dwarf
characteristics and variability. Aims: [...] In this work, we aim to discover
new strong variables in this spectral range by targeting ten previously
unsurveyed brown dwarfs. Methods: We used the NOTCam at the Nordic Optical
Telescope to observe 11 targets, with spectral types ranging from L9.5 to T3.5,
in the J-band [...] Results: We report first discoveries of strong and
significant variability in four out of the ten targets [...] measuring
peak-to-peak amplitudes up to 10.7 +- 0.4% in J for the T1 dwarf 2MASS
J22153705+2110554, for which we observe significant light curve evolution
between the 2017 and 2018 epochs. We also report a marginally significant
detection of strong variability, and confirm that the well known 2MASS
J01365662+0933473 is still strongly variable three years after the last
reported epoch. Finally, we present an extensive multi-epoch catalogue of
strong variables reported in the literature and discuss possible correlations
that are identifiable from the catalogue. Conclusions: We significantly add to
the number of known strong variables, and through Poisson statistics infer an
occurrence rate for strong variability among L9-T3.5 brown dwarfs of
40[+32-19]%, which is in agreement with previous estimates. The new variables
identified in this work are also excellently suited for extensive
multi-wavelength observations dedicated to probing the 3D structure of brown
dwarf atmospheres.

computational hydrodynamical methods, such as the Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH), often becomes a main bottleneck for scaling their
performance beyond a few million fluid elements per computing node. Tree
structures are particularly suitable for SPH simulation codes, which rely on
finding the exact close neighbors of each fluid element (or SPH particle). In
this work we present a novel tree structure, named \textit{$b$-tree}, which
features an adaptive branching factor to reduce the depth of the neighbor
search. Depending on the particle spatial distribution, finding neighbors using
\tree has an asymptotic best case complexity of $O(n)$, as opposed to $O(n \log
n)$ for other classical tree structures such as octrees and quadtrees. We also
present the proposed tree structure as well as the algorithms to build it and
to find the exact close neighbors of all particles. We assess the scalability
of the proposed tree-based algorithms through an extensive set of performance
experiments in a shared-memory system. Results show that b-tree is up to
$12\times$ faster for building the tree and up to $1.6\times$ faster for
finding the exact neighbors of all particles when compared to its octree form.
Moreover, we apply b-tree to a SPH code and show its usefulness over the
existing octree implementation, where b-tree is up to $5\times$ faster for
finding the exact close neighbors compared to the legacy code.

effective-field-theory (EFT) approach provides a systematic framework to study
new-physics (NP) effects from a bottom-up perspective, as long as the NP scale
is sufficiently large compared to the energies probed in the experimental
observables. However, when taking into account the different quark and lepton
flavours, the number of free parameters increases dramatically, which makes
generic studies of the NP flavour structure infeasible. In this paper, we
address this issue in view of the recently observed ""flavour anomalies"" in
$B$-meson decays, which we take as a motivation to develop a general framework
that allows us to systematically reduce the number of flavour parameters in the
EFT. This framework can be easily used in global fits to flavour observables at
Belle II and LHCb as well as in analyses of flavour-dependent collider
signatures at the LHC. Our formalism represents an extension of the well-known
minimal-flavour-violation approach, and uses Froggatt-Nielsen charges to define
the flavour power-counting. As a relevant illustration of the formalism, we
apply it to the flavour structures which could be induced by a $U_1$ vector
leptoquark, which represents one of the possible explanations for the recent
hints of flavour non-universality in semileptonic $B$-decays. We study the
phenomenological viability of this specific framework performing a fit to
low-energy flavour observables.

geometry. While RMPflow has demonstrated promising performance, it requires the
user to provide sensible subtask policies as Riemannian motion policies (RMPs:
a motion policy and an importance matrix function), which can be a difficult
design problem in its own right. We propose RMPfusion, a variation of RMPflow,
to address this issue. RMPfusion supplements RMPflow with weight functions that
can hierarchically reshape the Lyapunov functions of the subtask RMPs according
to the current configuration of the robot and environment. This extra
flexibility can remedy imperfect subtask RMPs provided by the user, improving
the combined policy's performance. These weight functions can be learned by
back-propagation. Moreover, we prove that, under mild restrictions on the
weight functions, RMPfusion always yields a globally Lyapunov-stable motion
policy. This implies that we can treat RMPfusion as a structured policy class
in policy optimization that is guaranteed to generate stable policies, even
during the immature phase of learning. We demonstrate these properties of
RMPfusion in imitation learning experiments both in simulation and on a
real-world robot.

have been vigorously studied in the past decades. However, when tackling with
complicated tasks, classical kernel methods are not flexible or ""rich"" enough
to describe the data and hence could not yield satisfactory performance. In
this paper, via Random Fourier Features (RFF), we successfully incorporate the
deep architecture into kernel learning, which significantly boosts the
flexibility and richness of kernel machines while keeps kernels' advantage of
pairwise handling small data. With RFF, we could establish a deep structure and
make every kernel in RFF layers could be trained end-to-end. Since RFF with
different distributions could represent different kernels, our model has the
capability of finding suitable kernels for each layer, which is much more
flexible than traditional kernel-based methods where the kernel is
pre-selected. This fact also helps yield a more sophisticated kernel cascade
connection in the architecture. On small datasets (less than 1000 samples), for
which deep learning is generally not suitable due to overfitting, our method
achieves superior performance compared to advanced kernel methods. On
large-scale datasets, including non-image and image classification tasks, our
method also has competitive performance.

cosmological constraint and the global fit of neutrino oscillation experiments
does not seem like a wise choice at first glance since it obscures the
neutrinoless double beta decay and hence the Majorana nature of neutrinos.
Contrary to this naive expectation, we point out that the actual situation is
the opposite. The normal neutrino mass ordering opens the possibility of
excluding the higher solar octant and simultaneously measuring the two Majorana
CP phases in future $0\nu2\beta$ experiments. Especially, the funnel region
will completely disappear if the solar mixing angle takes the higher octant.
The combined precision measurement by the JUNO and Daya Bay experiments can
significantly reduce the uncertainty in excluding the higher octant. With a
typical $\mathcal O(\mbox{meV})$ sensitivity on the effective mass
$|m_{ee}^{}|$, the neutrinoless double beta decay experiment can tell if the
funnel region really exists and hence exclude the higher solar octant. With the
sensitivity further improved to sub-meV, the two Majorana CP phases can be
simultaneously determined. Thus, the normal neutrino mass ordering clearly
shows phenomenological advantages over the inverted one.

implement a multi-instance cell detection and classification framework to
address this challenge. The framework firstly trains a region proposal model
based on Region-based Convolutional Network (RCNN) to obtain bounding-boxes of
regions potentially containing single or multiple cells from input microscopic
images, which are extracted as image patches. High-level image features are
then calculated from image patches through a pre-trained Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) with ResNet-50 structure. Using these image features inputs, six
networks are then trained to make multi-label prediction of whether a given
patch contains cells belonging to a specific cell type. As the six networks are
trained with image patches consisting of both individual cells and
touching/overlapping cells, they can effectively recognize cell types that are
presented in multi-instance image samples. Finally, for the purpose of SCD
testing, we train another machine learning classifier to predict whether the
given image patch contains abnormal cell type based on outputs from the six

good performance in automatic cell detection and classification.

ball of radius $\sqrt{2/\pi}$, as $n\to\infty$. For every point inside this
ball we determine the asymptotic number of vertices and the volume of the part

their dark-count rate into account. Using this distribution we compute the
error of the array detector by comparing the output to that of a ideal

be very high in order for the detector to resolve a hand-full of photons with
high probability. Furthermore, we conclude that in the worst-case scenario the

and non-dissipative continuum mechanics. The presented theory is the first
general relativistic theory that can deal simultaneously with viscous fluids as
well as irreversible deformations in solids and hence it also provides a fully
covariant formulation of the Newtonian continuum mechanics in arbitrary
curvilinear spacetimes. In such a formulation, the matter is considered as a
Riemann-Cartan manifold with non-vanishing torsion and the main field of the
theory being the non-holonomic basis tetrad field also called four-distortion
field. Thanks to the variational nature of the governing equations, the theory
is compatible with the variational structure of the Einstein field equations.
Symmetric hyperbolic equations are the only admissible equations in our unified
theory and thus, all perturbations propagate at finite speeds (even in the
diffusive regime) and the Cauchy problem for the governing PDEs is locally
well-posed for arbitrary and regular initial data which is very important for
the numerical treatment of the presented model. Nevertheless, the numerical
solution of the discussed hyperbolic equations is a challenging task because of
the presence of the stiff algebraic source terms of relaxation type and
non-conservative differential terms. Our numerical strategy is thus based on an
advanced family of high-accuracy ADER Discontinuous Galerkin and Finite Volume
methods which provides a very efficient framework for general relaxation
hyperbolic PDE systems. An extensive range of numerical examples is presented
demonstrating the applicability of our theory to relativistic flows of viscous
fluids and deformation of solids in Minkowski and curved spacetimes.

result, the presence of two anisotropic superconducting gaps in FeSe were

which a scalar field $\phi$ is nonminimally and kinetically coupled to Cold
Dark Matter (CDM). The scalar-graviton sector is described by the action of
Horndeski theories with the speed of gravitational waves equivalent to that of
light, whereas CDM is treated as a perfect fluid given by a Schutz-Sorkin
action. We consider two interacting Lagrangians of the forms $f_1(\phi,X)\rho_c
(n_c)$ and $f_2 (n_c, \phi,X) J_c^{\mu} \partial_{\mu}\phi$, where
$X=-\partial^{\mu} \phi \partial_{\mu} \phi/2$, $\rho_c$ and $n_c$ are the
energy density and number density of CDM respectively, and $J_c^{\mu}$ is a
vector field related to the CDM four velocity. We derive the scalar
perturbation equations of motion without choosing any special gauges and
identify conditions for the absence of ghosts and Laplacian instabilities on
scales deep inside the sound horizon. Applying a quasi-static approximation in
a gauge-invariant manner, we also obtain the effective gravitational couplings
felt by CDM and baryons for the modes relevant to the linear growth of
large-scale structures. In particular, the $n_c$ dependence in the coupling
$f_2$ gives rise to an interesting possibility for realizing the gravitational
coupling with CDM weaker than the Newton gravitational constant $G$.

on the direction and orientation of one coordinate axis. Each robot is equipped
with an externally visible light which can assume a constant number of
predefined colors. In this setting, we have given a complete characterization

spontaneous, permanent, and long-range magnetic coupling across the chains.
Whereas we find a ferromagnetic inter-chain coupling for FeO2/Ir(001), the
magnetic coupling of MnO2 on Ir(001) appears to be a non-collinear 120{\deg}

accomplishing several individual tasks (e.g. voice recognition, object

human intelligence that can learn and perform an unlimited number of tasks.
Humans' ability of learning and accumulating knowledge over their lifetime is
an essential aspect of their intelligence. Continual machine learning aims at a
higher level of machine intelligence through providing the artificial agents
with the ability to learn online from a non-stationary and never-ending stream
of data. A key component of such a never-ending learning process is to overcome
the catastrophic forgetting of previously seen data, a problem that neural
networks are well known to suffer from. The work described in this thesis has
been dedicated to the investigation of continual learning and solutions to
mitigate the forgetting phenomena in neural networks. To approach the continual
learning problem, we first assume a task incremental setting where tasks are
received one at a time and data from previous tasks are not stored. Since the
task incremental setting can't be assumed in all continual learning scenarios,
we also study the more general online continual setting. We consider an
infinite stream of data drawn from a non-stationary distribution with a
supervisory or self-supervisory training signal. The proposed methods in this
thesis have tackled important aspects of continual learning. They were
evaluated on different benchmarks and over various learning sequences. Advances
in the state of the art of continual learning have been shown and challenges
for bringing continual learning into application were critically identified.

quantum error correction using NISQ machines is the variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE) due to its shallow depth. A specific problem that we can
tackle is the strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard model, which is classically
intractable and has practical implications in areas like superconductivity. In
this Article, we outline the details about the gate sequence, the measurement
scheme and the relevant error mitigation techniques for the implementation of
the Hubbard VQE on a NISQ platform. We perform resource estimation for both
silicon spin qubits and superconducting qubits for a 50-qubit simulation, which
cannot be solved exactly via classical means, and find similar results. The
number of two-qubit gates required is on the order of 20000. Hence, to suppress
the mean circuit error count to a level such that we can obtain meaningful
results with the aid of error mitigation, we need to achieve a two-qubit gate
error rate of $\sim 10^{-4}$. When searching for the ground state, we need a
few days for one gradient-descent iteration, which is impractical. This can be
reduced to around $10$ minutes if we distribute our task among hundreds of
quantum processing units. Hence, implementing a 50-qubit Hubbard model VQE on a
NISQ machine can be on the brink of being feasible in near term, but further
optimisation of our simulation scheme, improvements in the gate fidelity,
improvements in the optimisation scheme and advances in the error mitigation
techniques are needed to overcome the remaining obstacles. The scalability of
the hardware platform is also essential to overcome the runtime issue via
parallelisation, which can be done on one single silicon multi-core processor

to retrieve a remembered pattern based on its distorted or incomplete version.
Attractor networks provide a sound model of associative memory: patterns are
stored as attractors of the network dynamics and associative retrieval is
performed by running the dynamics starting from a query pattern until it
converges to an attractor. In such models the dynamics are often implemented as
an optimization procedure that minimizes an energy function, such as in the
classical Hopfield network. In general it is difficult to derive a writing rule
for a given dynamics and energy that is both compressive and fast. Thus, most
research in energy-based memory has been limited either to tractable energy
models not expressive enough to handle complex high-dimensional objects such as
natural images, or to models that do not offer fast writing. We present a novel
meta-learning approach to energy-based memory models (EBMM) that allows one to
use an arbitrary neural architecture as an energy model and quickly store
patterns in its weights. We demonstrate experimentally that our EBMM approach
can build compressed memories for synthetic and natural data, and is capable of
associative retrieval that outperforms existing memory systems in terms of the
reconstruction error and compression rate.

decade how classical realizability provides a surprising technique to build

realizability subsumes Cohen's forcing, and even more, gives rise to unexpected
models of set theories. Pursuing the algebraic analysis of these models that
was first undertaken by Streicher, Miquel recently proposed to lay the
algebraic foundation of classical realizability and forcing within new
structures which he called implicative algebras. These structures are a
generalization of Boolean algebras based on an internal law representing the
implication. Notably, implicative algebras allow for the adequate
interpretation of both programs (i.e. proofs) and their types (i.e. formulas)
in the same structure. The very definition of implicative algebras takes
position on a presentation of logic through universal quantification and the
implication and, computationally, relies on the call-by-name
$\lambda$-calculus. In this paper, we investigate the relevance of this choice,
by introducing two similar structures. On the one hand, we define disjunctive
algebras, which rely on internal laws for the negation and the disjunction and
which we show to be particular cases of implicative algebras. On the other
hand, we introduce conjunctive algebras, which rather put the focus on
conjunctions and on the call-by-value evaluation strategy. We finally show how
disjunctive and conjunctive algebras algebraically reflect the well-known
duality of computation between call-by-name and call-by-value.

key problems in robotic vision. However, even with recent advances with machine
learning, there is no high-fidelity universal 3D reconstruction method for this
optimization problem as schemes often cater to specific image modalities and
are often biased by scene abnormalities. Simply put, there always remains an
information gap due to the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios. To this end,
we demonstrate a feedback control framework which invokes operator inputs (also
prone to errors) in order to augment existing reconstruction schemes. For
proof-of-concept, we choose a classical region-based stereoscopic
reconstruction approach and show how an ill-posed model can be augmented with
operator input to be much more robust to scene artifacts. We provide necessary
conditions for stability via Lyapunov analysis and perhaps more importantly, we
show that the stability depends on a notion of absolute curvature.
Mathematically, this aligns with previous work that has shown Ricci curvature
as proxy for functional robustness of dynamical networked systems. We conclude
with results that show how our method can improve standalone reconstruction
schemes.

organism and eventually the products and byproducts consumed and produced. This
work presents a low cost modular system designed to facilitate quantitative
study of growth processes and resource exchanges in organisms such as plants,
fungi and insect larvae. The proposed system constitutes of modular units each
performing a specific function. A novel compact thermoelectric cooler based
unit is designed for conditioning the air. Sensor cluster for measuring gas
concentrations, air properties (temperature, humidity, pressure), and growing
medium properties is implemented and tested. An actuator cluster for resource
exchange and a wiring and control scheme for light spectrum adjustment is
proposed. A three tier hierarchical software framework consisting of an
open-source cloud platform for data aggregation and user interaction, embedded
firmware for microcontroller, and an application development framework for test
automation and experiment regime design is developed and presented. A series of
experiments and tests were performed using the designed hardware and software
to evaluate its capabilities and limitations. This controlled environment was
used to study the photosynthesis and its dependency on temperature and light
intensity in Ocimum basilicum. In a second experiment, evolution of metabolic
activity of Hermetia illucens larvae over its larval phase was studied and the
metabolic products and byproducts were quantitatively measured.

  on Selected Areas in Communications",,,,"eess.SY cs.GT cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the duopoly competition between renewable energy suppliers
with or without energy storage in a local energy market. The storage investment
brings the benefits of stabilizing renewable energy suppliers' outputs, but it
also leads to substantial investment costs as well as some surprising changes
in the market outcome. To study the equilibrium decisions of storage investment
in the renewable energy suppliers' competition, we model the interactions
between suppliers and consumers using a three-stage game-theoretic model. In
Stage I, at the beginning of the investment horizon, suppliers decide whether
to invest in storage. Once such decisions have been made, in the day-ahead
market of each day, suppliers decide on their bidding prices and quantities in
Stage II, based on which consumers decide the electricity quantity purchased
from each supplier in Stage III. In the real-time market, a supplier is
penalized if his actual generation falls short of his commitment. We
characterize a price-quantity competition equilibrium of Stage II, and we
further characterize a storage-investment equilibrium in Stage I incorporating
electricity-selling revenue and storage cost. Counter-intuitively, we show that
the uncertainty of renewable energy without storage investment can lead to
higher supplier profits compared with the stable generations with storage
investment due to the reduced market competition under random energy
generation. Simulations further illustrate results due to the market
competition. For example, a higher penalty for not meeting the commitment, a
higher storage cost, or a lower consumer demand can sometimes increase a
supplier's profit. We also show that although storage investment can increase a
supplier 's profit, the first-mover supplier who invests in storage may benefit
less than the free-rider competitor who chooses not to invest.

is formed where superconductivity as well as mode softening is absent. For this

short, repetitive sentences of the Multi30k dataset (the only multimodal MT
dataset available at the time), which renders the source text sufficient for
context. In this work, we further investigate this hypothesis on a new large
scale multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) dataset, How2, which has 1.57 times
longer mean sentence length than Multi30k and no repetition. We propose and
evaluate three novel fusion techniques, each of which is designed to ensure the
utilization of visual context at different stages of the Sequence-to-Sequence
transduction pipeline, even under full linguistic context. However, we still
obtain only marginal gains under full linguistic context and posit that visual
embeddings extracted from deep vision models (ResNet for Multi30k, ResNext for
How2) do not lend themselves to increasing the discriminativeness between the
vocabulary elements at token level prediction in NMT. We demonstrate this
qualitatively by analyzing attention distribution and quantitatively through
Principal Component Analysis, arriving at the conclusion that it is the quality
of the visual embeddings rather than the length of sentences, which need to be
improved in existing MMT datasets.

using a plane-waves basis set within density-functional theory (DFT) and
beyond, i.e.\ including exact non-local exchange using hybrid functional (HSE)

Ag/MgO/Ag heterostructure model and we focus on the evolution of the zero-bias
conductance as a function of the MgO film thickness. Our study shows that the
correction of the electronic structure beyond semi-local density functionals
goes in the right direction to improve the agreement with experiments,
significantly reducing the zero-bias conductance. This effect becomes more
evident at larger MgO thickness, that is in increasing tunneling regime. We
also observe that the reduction of the conductance seems more related to the
correction of wavefunctions rather than energies, and thus not directly related
to the correction of the band-gap of bulk MgO. $G_0W_0$ and HSE both provide a
correct band-gap in agreement with experiments, but only HSE gives a
significant reduction of the conductance. COHSEX, while overestimating the
band-gap, gives a reduction of the conductance very close to HSE.

of redshifts, from the dark ages down to the completion of reionization.
Observing the 21cm cosmological signal will extend our understanding of the
evolution of the Universe and it is thus important to investigate the
predictions of different cosmological models. In this paper we focus on the
prospect of constraining coupled quintessence models during the Epoch of
Reionization both for global signal experiments and for intensity mapping
surveys. To derive the all-sky 21cm signal and fluctuations in coupled
quintessence, we simulate cosmological volumes of the 21cm signal including the
coupling between dark matter and the quintessence field, where the strength of
the coupling is labeled by the parameter $Q$. We show that the coupling between
dark matter and quintessence modifies structure formation and expedites the
process of reionization. For the upcoming 21cm line surveys like SKA and a
fiducial global 21cm signal experiment, we perform a Fisher matrix analysis to
constrain the coupling $Q$ and the dark matter density parameter
$\Omega_\mathrm{dm}$.
  The results indicate that SKA will be able to place a 68% upper limit $0.04$
to $|Q|$. At the same time, such a global 21cm detector provides a constraint
on the dark matter density parameter $\Omega_\mathrm{dm}$ around
$\Delta\Omega_{\rm dm}\approx 0.005$, whereas SKA sets a quite weaker
constraint around $\Delta\Omega_{\rm dm}\approx0.1$. These constraints are
comparable to those already obtained from the cosmic microwave background, but
explore an entirely different redshift range.

slowly with time, while, at a characteristic time, the decay crossesover to a

are being developed. Here, we propose novel EEG parameters created by using two
kinds of waveforms discriminated by voltage thresholds from a new perspective.
Methods: Six young-adult beagles and 6 senior beagles were anaesthetised with
end-tidal sevoflurane (SEV) of 2.0%-4.0% in 0.5% intervals, and 2-channel EEG
(256 Hz) was recorded. Two events were discriminated: a consecutive part
({\tau}) with a peak-to-peak potential difference (Vpp) within 1-6, 8, 12, or
20 mcrV, and another part (burst) with Vpp outside the threshold. Number of
{\tau} (N{\tau}), mean {\tau} duration (M{\tau}), total percentage of {\tau}
(SR{\tau}), mean burst duration (Mbst), and amplitude of burst (Abst) were
evaluated as anaesthesia depth indicators using Pearsons correlation
coefficients (r). Results: When Vpp was near the suppression wave threshold,
N{\tau} had the highest correlation with SEV in both groups. As SEV was
increased until onset of burst suppression, N{\tau} decreased, M{\tau} remained
unchanged, and Mbst and Abst increased. In the young-adult group, mean |r|
exceeded 0.95 for N{\tau} with Vpp of 4-6 mcrV, for Mbst with Vpp of 8-12 mcrV,
and for Abst with Vpp of 4-12 mcrV. In the senior group, r exceeded 0.90 for
N{\tau} with Vpp of 4 mcrV and for Abst with Vpp of 5-12 mcrV. Conclusion: We
developed new EEG parameters that were almost perfectly correlated with
volatile anaesthetic concentrations using traditional bipolar recording. This
study suggests that the effect of anaesthetics on EEG can be investigated from
two directions: pacemaker ({\tau}) and generator (burst).

(DR14) at 3.6<z<4.6 and -29.0<M1450<-26.0. Starting from UV/optical rest-frame
spectra of the whole QSO sample, we estimate the escape fraction and free path
individually for each of them. We calculate the Lyman Continuum (LyC) escape
fraction as the flux ratio blue-ward (~900 A rest-frame) and red-ward (~930 A
rest-frame) of the Lyman limit. We then obtain the probability distribution
function (PDF) of the individual free paths of the QSOs in the sample and study
its evolution in luminosity and redshift, comparing our results with the ones
found in literature so far. We find a lower limit to the mean LyC escape
fraction of 0.49, in agreement with the values obtained for both brighter and
fainter sources at the same redshift. We show that the free paths of ionizing
photons are characterized by a skewed distribution function peaked at low
values, with an average of ~49-59 proper Mpc at z~4, after excluding possible
associated absorbers. This value is larger than the one obtained at the same
redshift by many authors in the literature using different techniques. Finally,
we also find that the redshift evolution of this parameter results to be
possibly milder than previously thought. Our new determination of the mean free
path at z~4 implies that previous estimates of the HI photo-ionization rate

rectangles where the number of symbols common to two columns is always one of
two possible values, differing by 1, which we call \emph{near Youden

autotopism group and investigate to which degree a certain transformation can
yield other row-column designs, namely double arrays, triple arrays and sesqui
arrays. Finally, we also investigate certain Latin rectangles with three
possible pairwise intersection sizes for the columns and demonstrate that these
can give rise to triple and sesqui arrays which cannot be obtained from Youden
rectangles, using the transformation mentioned above.

associated with the supernova remnant (SNR) MCSNRJ0513-6724 in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using XMM-Newton X-ray observations. The HMXB is
located at the geometrical centre of extended soft X-ray emission, which we
confirm as an SNR. The HMXB spectrum is consistent with an absorbed power law
with spectral index ~1.6 and a luminosity of 7x10^{33} ergs/s (0.2--12 keV).
Tentative X-ray pulsations are observed with a periodicity of 4.4 s and the
OGLE I-band light curve of the optical counterpart from more than 17.5 years
reveals a period of 2.2324\pm0.0003 d, which we interpret as the orbital period
of the binary system. The X-ray spectrum of the SNR is consistent with
non-equilibrium shock models as expected for young/less evolved SNRs. From the
derived ionisation time scale we estimate the age of the SNR to be <6 kyr. The
association of the HMXB with the SNR makes it the youngest HMXB, in the
earliest evolutionary stage known to date. A HMXB as young as this can switch
on as an accreting pulsar only when the spin period has reached a critical
value. Under this assumption, we obtain an upper limit to the magnetic field of
< 5x10^{11} G. This implies several interesting possibilities including
magnetic field burial, possibly by an episode of post-supernova hyper-critical
accretion. Since these fields are expected to diffuse out on a timescale of
10^{3}-10^{4} years, the discovery of a very young HMXB can provide us the
unique opportunity to observe the evolution of the observable magnetic field
for the first time in X-ray binaries.

is known about distance-r domination. This is actually the case for other
important closely-related covering problem, namely, the distance-$r$
independent set problem. By result of Kuhn et al. we know the distributed
domination problem is hard on high girth graphs; we study the problem on a
slightly restricted subclass of these graphs: graphs of bounded expansion with
high girth, i.e. their girth should be at least $4r + 3$. We show that in such
graphs, for every constant $r$, a simple greedy CONGEST algorithm provides a
constant-factor approximation of the minimum distance-$r$ dominating set
problem, in a constant number of rounds. More precisely, our constants are
dependent to $r$, not to the size of the graph. This is the first algorithm
that shows there are non-trivial constant factor approximations in constant
number of rounds for any distance $r$-covering problem in distributed settings.
To show the dependency on r is inevitable, we provide an unconditional lower
bound showing the same problem is hard already on rings. We also show that our
analysis of the algorithm is relatively tight, that is any significant
improvement to the approximation factor requires new algorithmic ideas.

Earth is one of the most important parameters in determining space weather. We
have used a new approach to predicting this parameter. First, in our study, we
have introduced a new definition of the speed of ejection. It can be considered
as the maximum speed that the CME achieves during the expansion into the
interplanetary medium. Additionally, in our research we have used not only
observations from the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft but
also from Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) spacecrafts. We
focus on halo and partial halo CMEs during the ascending phase of Solar Cycle
24. During this period the STEREO spacecraft were in quadrature position in
relation to the Earth. We demonstrated that these conditions of the STEREO
observations can be crucial for an accurate determination of the transit times
(TTs) of CMEs to the Earth. In our research we defined a new initial velocity
of the CME, the maximum velocity determined from the velocity profiles obtained
from a moving linear fit to five consecutive height time points. This new
approach can be important from the point of view of space weather as the new
parameter is highly correlated with the final velocity of ICMEs. It allows one
to predict the TTs with the same accuracy as previous models. However, what is
more important is the fact that the new approach has radically reduced the
maximum TT estimation errors to 29 hours. Previous studies determined the TT
with a maximum error equal to 50 hours.

a region existed outside of the black hole's event horizon where no time-like

within this ergosphere region could possess negative energy, as measured by an
observer at infinity. When captured by the horizon, these negative energy
particles essentially extract mass and angular momentum from the black hole.
While the decay of a single particle within the ergosphere is not a
particularly efficient means of energy extraction, the ""collision"" of multiple
particles can reach arbitrarily high center-of-mass energy in the limit of
extremal black hole spin. The resulting particles can escape with high
efficiency, potentially serving as a probe of high-energy particle physics as
well as general relativity. In this paper, we briefly review the history of the

fashion to the spontaneous scalarization scenario in scalar-tensor theories.
Scalar-dependent disformal transformations have been investigated in this
context, and our focus is understanding the transformations that depend on more
general fields. We show that vector-dependent disformal couplings can be
obtained in various different ways, each leading to spontaneous vectorization
as indicated by the instabilities in linearized equations of motion. However,
we also show that spontaneous growth is not evident beyond vectors. For
example, we could not identify a spontaneous growth mechanism for a spinor
field through disformal transformations, even though there is a known example
for conformal transformations. This invites further work on the fundamental
differences between the two types of metric transformations. We argue that our
results are relevant for observations in strong gravity such as gravitational
wave detections due to their promise of large deviations from general

from a single source into training and test sets. While such focus on
in-distribution learning scenarios has led to interesting advancement, it has
not been able to tell if models are relying on dataset biases as shortcuts for
successful prediction (e.g., using snow cues for recognising snowmobiles),
resulting in biased models that fail to generalise when the bias shifts to a
different class. The cross-bias generalisation problem has been addressed by
de-biasing training data through augmentation or re-sampling, which are often
prohibitive due to the data collection cost (e.g., collecting images of a
snowmobile on a desert) and the difficulty of quantifying or expressing biases
in the first place. In this work, we propose a novel framework to train a
de-biased representation by encouraging it to be different from a set of
representations that are biased by design. This tactic is feasible in many
scenarios where it is much easier to define a set of biased representations
than to define and quantify bias. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method
across a variety of synthetic and real-world biases; our experiments show that
the method discourages models from taking bias shortcuts, resulting in improved
generalisation. Source code is available at https://github.com/clovaai/rebias.

risk damage, time-consuming resets, and often provide little gradient
information. Adding safety constraints to exploration typically requires a lot
of prior knowledge and domain expertise. We present a safety measure which
implicitly captures how the system dynamics relate to a set of failure states.
Not only can this measure be used as a safety function, but also to directly
compute the set of safe state-action pairs. Further, we show a model-free
approach to learn this measure by active sampling using Gaussian processes.
While safety can only be guaranteed after learning the safety measure, we show
that failures can already be greatly reduced by using the estimated measure
during learning.

to pulsar timing residuals from continuous multi-hour observations of seven
millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We present scintillation bandwidth measurements for
all MSPs in the sample, some for the first time, and scintillation timescale
measurements and lower limits for all MSPs for the first time. In addition, we
present upper limits on the contribution of pulse phase jitter to the timing
residual error for all MSPs. These long observations also allow us to constrain
variations in dispersion measures (DMs) on hour-long timescales for several
millisecond pulsars. We find that there are no apparent DM variations in any of
the MSPs studied on these timescales as expected. In light of new radio
telescopes such as the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME),
which will be able to time many pulsars for a short time each day, we search
for differences in timing precisions from continuous TOAs and from equivalent
length time-discontinuous TOAs. We find no differences in the precision for any
MSP in our sample, as expected. We conclude that the TOA variations are
consistent with the expected breakdown into template-fitting, jitter, and
scintillation errors.

Cyber-Physical systems (CPS) since these models are not often amenable to
static and symbolic testing and verification. Black-box testing, however,
requires to execute the model under test for a large number of candidate test
inputs. This poses a challenge for a large and practically-important category
of CPS models, known as compute-intensive CPS (CI-CPS) models, where a single
simulation may take hours to complete. We propose a novel approach, namely
ARIsTEO, to enable effective and efficient testing of CI-CPS models. Our
approach embeds black-box testing into an iterative approximation-refinement
loop. At the start, some sampled inputs and outputs of the CI-CPS model under
test are used to generate a surrogate model that is faster to execute and can
be subjected to black-box testing. Any failure-revealing test identified for
the surrogate model is checked on the original model. If spurious, the test
results are used to refine the surrogate model to be tested again. Otherwise,
the test reveals a valid failure. We evaluated ARIsTEO by comparing it with
S-Taliro, an open-source and industry-strength tool for testing CPS models. Our
results, obtained based on five publicly-available CPS models, show that, on
average, ARIsTEO is able to find 24% more requirements violations than S-Taliro
and is 31% faster than S-Taliro in finding those violations. We further
assessed the effectiveness and efficiency of ARIsTEO on a large industrial case
study from the satellite domain. In contrast to S-Taliro, ARIsTEO successfully
tested two different versions of this model and could identify three
requirements violations, requiring four hours, on average, for each violation.

presented in this paper are therefore specific to this detector. The method can
however be applied in other contexts, either to other lutetium based PET

  Coherence Tomography Images",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Purpose: To remove retinal shadows from optical coherence tomography (OCT)
images of the optic nerve head(ONH).
  Methods:2328 OCT images acquired through the center of the ONH using a
Spectralis OCT machine for both eyes of 13 subjects were used to train a
generative adversarial network (GAN) using a custom loss function. Image
quality was assessed qualitatively (for artifacts) and quantitatively using the
intralayer contrast: a measure of shadow visibility ranging from 0
(shadow-free) to 1 (strong shadow) and compared to compensated images. This was
computed in the Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL), the Inner Plexiform Layer
(IPL), the Photoreceptor layer (PR) and the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE)
layers.
  Results: Output images had improved intralayer contrast in all ONH tissue
layers. On average the intralayer contrast decreased by 33.7$\pm$6.81%,
28.8$\pm$10.4%, 35.9$\pm$13.0%, and43.0$\pm$19.5%for the RNFL, IPL, PR, and RPE
layers respectively, indicating successful shadow removal across all depths.
This compared to 70.3$\pm$22.7%, 33.9$\pm$11.5%, 47.0$\pm$11.2%,
26.7$\pm$19.0%for compensation. Output images were also free from artifacts
commonly observed with compensation.
  Conclusions: DeshadowGAN significantly corrected blood vessel shadows in OCT
images of the ONH. Our algorithm may be considered as a pre-processing step to
improve the performance of a wide range of algorithms including those currently
being used for OCT image segmentation, denoising, and classification.
  Translational Relevance: DeshadowGAN could be integrated to existing OCT
devices to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of ocular pathologies.

Among the HO discretization variants, discontinuous Galerkin schemes offer a
collection of advantageous features which have lead to a strong increase in
interest in them and related formulations in the last decade. The methods have
matured sufficiently to be of practical use for a range of problems, for
example in direct numerical and large eddy simulation of turbulence. However,
in order to take full advantage of the potential benefits of these methods, all
steps in the simulation chain must be designed and executed with HO in mind.
Especially in this area, many commercially available closed-source solutions
fall short. In this work, we therefor present the FLEXI framework, a HO
consistent, open-source simulation tool chain for solving the compressible
Navier-Stokes equations in a high performance computing setting. We describe
the numerical algorithms and implementation details and give an overview of the
features and capabilities of all parts of the framework. Beyond these technical
details, we also discuss the important, but often overlooked issues of code
stability, reproducibility and user-friendliness. The benefits gained by
developing an open-source framework are discussed, with a particular focus on

method, e.g.\ as in \cite{Spielman2011resistances} using effective resistances,
gives, with high probability, a locally computable matrix $\tilde H$ with row
sparsity at most $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}\log n)$. For a symmetric matrix $H$
of size $n$ with $m$ non-zero entries, a one-time classical runtime overhead of
$\mathcal{O}(m||H||t\log n/\epsilon)$ expended in spectral sparsification is
then found to be useful as a way to obtain a sparse matrix $\tilde H$ that can
be used to approximate time evolution $e^{itH}$ under the Hamiltonian $H$ to
precision $\epsilon$. Once such a sparsifier is obtained, it could be used with
a variety of quantum algorithms in the query model that make crucial use of row
sparsity. We focus on the case of efficient quantum algorithms for sparse
Hamiltonian simulation, since Hamiltonian simulation underlies, as a key
subroutine, several quantum algorithms, including quantum phase estimation and
recent ones for linear algebra. Finally, we also give two simple quantum
algorithms to estimate the row sparsity of an input matrix, which achieve a
query complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2})$ as opposed to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$

equivalently surface potential-- on the macroion (wall) surface. In addition to
asymptotic features at large distances from the wall, attention is paid to the
fate of the contact theorem, relating the contact density of ions to the local
wall charge density. For salt-free systems (counterions only), we make use of
results pertaining to the two-dimensional Liouville equation, supplemented by
an inverse approach. When salt is present, we invoke the exact two-soliton
solution to the 2D sinh-Gordon equation. This leads to inhomogeneous charge
patterns, that are either localized or periodic in space. Without salt, the
electrostatic signature of a charge pattern on the macroion fades exponentially
with distance for a planar macroion, while it decays as an inverse power-law
for a cylindrical macroion. With salt, our study is limited to the planar

briefly operators of class $\mathcal Q.$ These operators emerged from the study
of Brownian isometries performed by Agler and Stankus via detailed analysis of
the time shift operator of the modified Brownian motion process. It turns out
that the class $\mathcal Q$ is closely related to the Cauchy dual subnormality
problem which asks whether the Cauchy dual of a completely hyperexpansive
operator is subnormal. Since the class $\mathcal Q$ is closed under the
operation of taking the Cauchy dual, the problem itself becomes a part of a
more general question of investigating subnormality in this class. This issue,
along with the analysis of nonstandard moment problems, covers a large part of
the paper. Using the Taylor spectrum technique culminates in a full
characterization of subnormal operators of class $\mathcal Q.$ As a
consequence, we solve the Cauchy dual subnormality problem for expansive
operators of class $\mathcal Q$ in the affirmative, showing that the original
problem can surprisingly be extended to a class of operators that are far from
being completely hyperexpansive. The Taylor spectrum approach turns out to be
fruitful enough to allow us to characterize other classes of operators

for field computations, providing specific constructs for evolution (time) and
neighbor interaction (space), which are handled by separate operators (called
rep and nbr, respectively). This approach, however, intrinsically limits the
speed of information propagation that can be achieved by their combined use. In
this paper, we propose a new field-based coordination operator called share,
which captures the space-time nature of field computations in a single operator
that declaratively achieves: (i) observation of neighbors' values; (ii)
reduction to a single local value; and (iii) update and converse sharing to
neighbors of a local variable. We show that for an important class of
self-stabilising computations, share can replace all occurrences of rep and nbr

allows many prior field calculus algorithms to be greatly accelerated, which we

variation of the concept of self-orthogonal Latin squares which is applicable
on larger sets of mutually orthogonal Latin squares and MOLR, namely that each
Latin rectangle in a set of MOLR is isotopic to each other rectangle in the
set. We call such a set of MOLR \emph{homogeneous}. In the course of doing
this, we perform a complete enumeration of non-isotopic sets of $t$ mutually
orthogonal $k\times n$ Latin rectangles for $k\leq n \leq 7$, for all $t < n$.
Specifically, we keep track of homogeneous sets of MOLR, as well as sets of
MOLR where the autotopism group acts transitively on the rectangles, and we
call such sets of MOLR \emph{transitive}. We build the sets of MOLR row by row,
and in this process we also keep track of which of the MOLR are homogeneous
and/or transitive in each step of the construction process. We use the prefix
\emph{stepwise} to refer to sets of MOLR with this property. Sets of MOLR are
connected to other discrete objects, notably finite geometries and certain
regular graphs. Here we observe that all projective planes of order at most 9
except the Hughes plane can be constructed from a stepwise transitive MOLR.

which many surprisingly simple formulas have been obtained. Here we
combinatorially enumerate the pairs of long cycles whose product has a given
cycle-type and separates certain elements, extending several lines of studies,
and we obtain general quantitative relations. As consequences, in a unified

we obtain an explicit formula for the number of pairs of long cycles on the set
such that the product of the long cycles does not mix the elements from
distinct blocks of the partition and has an independently prescribed number of
cycles for each block of elements. As applications, we obtain new explicit
formulas concerning factorizations of any even permutation into long cycles and

few-shot learning setting. The key idea is to leverage a large number of
similar few-shot tasks in order to learn how to adapt a base-learner to a new
task for which only a few labeled samples are available. As deep neural
networks (DNNs) tend to overfit using a few samples only, typical meta-learning
models use shallow neural networks, thus limiting its effectiveness. In order
to achieve top performance, some recent works tried to use the DNNs pre-trained
on large-scale datasets but mostly in straight-forward manners, e.g., (1)
taking their weights as a warm start of meta-training, and (2) freezing their
convolutional layers as the feature extractor of base-learners. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach called meta-transfer learning (MTL) which learns to
transfer the weights of a deep NN for few-shot learning tasks. Specifically,
meta refers to training multiple tasks, and transfer is achieved by learning
scaling and shifting functions of DNN weights for each task. In addition, we
introduce the hard task (HT) meta-batch scheme as an effective learning
curriculum that further boosts the learning efficiency of MTL. We conduct
few-shot learning experiments and report top performance for five-class
few-shot recognition tasks on three challenging benchmarks: miniImageNet,
tieredImageNet and Fewshot-CIFAR100 (FC100). Extensive comparisons to related
works validate that our MTL approach trained with the proposed HT meta-batch
scheme achieves top performance. An ablation study also shows that both
components contribute to fast convergence and high accuracy.

cosmological $\Lambda$-term at the Planck scale $M_{\rm pl}$. The cosmological
energy density $\rho_{_{_\Lambda}}$ drives inflation and simultaneously reduces
its value to create the matter-energy density $\rho_{_{_M}}$ via the continuous
pair productions of massive fermions and antifermions. The decreasing
$\rho_{_{_\Lambda}}$ and increasing $\rho_{_{_M}}$, in turn, slows down the
inflation to its end when the pair production rate $\Gamma_M$ is larger than
the Hubble rate $H$. The density $\rho_{_{_\Lambda}}$ and Hubble rate $H$ are
uniquely determined by two independent equations from the Einstein equation and
energy conservation law, besides the $\rho_{_{_M}}$ is determined by pair
productions. As a result, inflation naturally appears and theoretical results
agree with Planck 2018 observations. Suppose that the reheating efficiently
converts $\rho_{_{_\Lambda}}$ to $\rho_{_{_M}}\gg \rho_{_{_\Lambda}}$
accounting for the most relevant Universe mass, and some massive pairs decay to
relativistic particles of energy density $\rho_{_{_R}}$ starting the hot Big
Bang. The back reaction $\rho_{_{_M}}\leftrightarrow H\leftrightarrow
\rho_{_{_\Lambda}}$ is weak but continues. As a consequence, $\rho_{_\Lambda}$
closely tracks down $\rho_{_R}$ from the reheating end up to the
radiation-matter equilibrium, then it varies very slowly,
$\rho_{_\Lambda}\propto$ constant, due to the transition from radiation
dominant epoch to matter dominant epoch. Therefore the cosmic coincidence

this challenge, but often requires long acquisition times or lacks high

that provides intrinsic noncontact biomechanical contrast and generates
mechanical cross-sectional images inside large specimens, with high mechanical

spontaneous Brillouin microscopy. We used SBS microscopy in different
biological applications, including the quantification of the high-frequency

algorithms. In this paper, we explore Euclidean distance estimation on fisheye

is difficult in practice, but self-supervised learning approaches show
promising results and could potentially overcome the problem. We present a
novel self-supervised scale-aware framework for learning Euclidean distance and
ego-motion from raw monocular fisheye videos without applying rectification.
While it is possible to perform piece-wise linear approximation of fisheye

issues like re-sampling distortion and discontinuities in transition regions.
To encourage further research in this area, we will release our dataset as part

network entropy through feedback control. Given such feedback input can reverse
entropic changes, we adapt the moniker of Maxwells Demon to motivate our
approach. In particular, it has been recently shown that Ricci curvature from
geometry is intrinsically connected to Boltzmann entropy as well as functional
robustness of networks or the ability to maintain functionality in the presence
of random fluctuations. From this, the discrete Ricci flow provides a natural
avenue to rewire a particular networks underlying geometry to improve
throughout and resilience. Due to the real-world setting for which one may be
interested in imposing nonlinear constraints amongst particular agents to
understand the network dynamic evolution, controlling discrete Ricci flow may
be necessary (e.g., we may seek to understand the entropic dynamics and
curvature flow between two networks as opposed to solely curvature shrinkage).
In turn, this can be formulated as a natural control problem for which we
employ feedback control towards discrete Ricci-based flow and show that under
certain discretization, namely Ollivier-Ricci curvature, one can show stability
via Lyapunov analysis. We conclude with preliminary results with remarks on
potential applications that will be a subject of future work.

the simulation of hydrodynamic lubrication. The code is herein validated in
relation to a uniform slider bearing (i.e., for a constant lubricant film
depth) and a linear slider bearing (i.e., for a film depth with a linear
profile variation along the main flow direction). Validations refer to
comparisons with analytical solutions, herein generalized to consider any
Dirichlet boundary condition. Further, this study allows a first code
validation of the fluid-fixed frontier interactions under no-slip conditions.
With respect to the most state-of-the-art models (2D codes based on Reynolds'
equation for fluid films), the following distinctive features are highlighted:
(i) 3D formulation on all the terms of the Navier-Stokes equations for
incompressible fluids with uniform viscosity; (ii) validations on both local
and global quantities (pressure and velocity profiles; load-bearing capacity);
(iii) possibility to simulate any 3D topology. This study also shows the
advantages of using a CFD-SPH code in simulating the inertia and 3D effects
close to the slider edges, and it opens new research directions overcoming the
limitations of the codes for hydrodynamic lubrication based on the Reynolds'
equation for fluid films. This study finally allows SPHERA to deal with
hydrodynamic lubrication and empowers the code for other relevant application

by floods and earth landslides; rock landslides). SPHERA is developed and

Bloch-Floquet waves in chiral elastic lattice systems. This area has received a
significant attention in the context of ""topologically protected"" waveforms.
Although practical applications of chiral elastic lattices are widely
appreciated, especially in problems of controlling low-frequency vibrations,
wave polarisation and filtering, the fundamental questions of the relationship
of these lattices to classical waveforms associated with longitudinal and shear
waves retain a substantial scope for further development. The notion of
chirality is introduced into the systematic analysis of dispersive elastic
waves in a doubly-periodic lattice. Important quantitative characteristics of
the dynamic response of the lattice, such as lattice flux and lattice
circulation, are used in the analysis along with the novel concept of ""vortex
waveforms"" that characterise the dynamic response of the chiral system. We note
that the continuum concepts of pressure and shear waves do not apply for waves
in a lattice, especially in the case when the wavelength is comparable with the
size of the elementary cell of the periodic structure. Special critical regimes
are highlighted when vortex waveforms become dominant. Analytical findings are
accompanied by illustrative numerical simulations.

long-established model of disaggregated file system access. Instead, by
colocating computation and PMM storage, we can provide applications much higher
I/O performance, sub-second application failover, and strong consistency. To
demonstrate this, we built the Assise distributed file system, based on a
persistent, replicated coherence protocol for managing a set of
server-colocated PMMs as a fast, crash-recoverable cache between applications
and slower disaggregated storage, such as SSDs. Unlike disaggregated file
systems, Assise maximizes locality for all file IO by carrying out IO on
colocated PMM whenever possible and minimizes coherence overhead by maintaining
consistency at IO operation granularity, rather than at fixed block sizes.
  We compare Assise to Ceph/Bluestore, NFS, and Octopus on a cluster with Intel
Optane DC PMMs and SSDs for common cloud applications and benchmarks, such as
LevelDB, Postfix, and FileBench. We find that Assise improves write latency up
to 22x, throughput up to 56x, fail-over time up to 103x, and scales up to 6x
better than its counterparts, while providing stronger consistency semantics.
Assise promises to beat the MinuteSort world record by 1.5x.

economically viable, straightforward and cost effective techniques need to be
developed to separate the individual materials in a composite electrode.
Ultrasonic separation might be such a technique, provided that lithium ion
battery microparticles respond predictably to a sound field. Lithium ion
battery cathodes contain hydrophobic carbon. Owing to the incompressibility of
a solid, the thin gaseous layer surrounding these hydrophobic particles must
oscillate asymmetrically, when subjected to ultrasound. Consequently, the
harmonic content of the ultrasound signal radiated from hydrophobic
microparticles must be higher than that from hydrophilic microparticles with
the same size. The question of whether the harmonic signal response generated
by physical hydrophobic microparticles present in lithium ion battery cathodes
is higher than the harmonic response of other component materials in the
cathode is the focus of this paper. The scattering response of cathode
materials subjected to 1-MHz ultrasound was measured and compared. The cathode
materials C65, PVDF, and NMC respond differently to 1-MHz ultrasound. The
superharmonic response of C65 has been attributed to asymmetric oscillations
owing to its hydrophobicity. In addition, C65 hydrophobic microparticles might
be suitable candidates for harmonic imaging.
