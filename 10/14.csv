these IoT devices are battery-powered and are interconnected via a wireless
network. IoT devices may be used to carry out critical tasks. Thus, the IoT
network requires a resilient architecture that supports semantic search,
failure discovery, data recovery, and dynamic and autonomous network

networks. We evaluate the proposed scheme in terms of its power consumption and
data delivery time, and then compare the results with those of recent
resilience schemes such as schemes based on redundancy and replication. The
proposed framework was optimized using mixed integer linear programming and
real-time heuristics were developed, thus embedding a virtual layer into a
physical layer based on a service-oriented architecture (SOA). The proposed
framework offers different combinations of packet resilience in terms of
recovering the lost data by using end- to-end mechanisms. We further analyzed
these schemes by investigating the power consumption, data delivery time, and
network overhead of these techniques. The results showed that the proposed
splitting technique enhanced the network performance by reducing the power

energy-efficient nodes and routes in IoT networks.

the way of absorption except for the hallmark Li I 6707 A signature of youth
plus weak e.g. Ca I and notably Ba II; strong wind/outflow in Ca II, Mg I b, Na

weak narrow rest-velocity atomic line emission. The 12CO bandheads are weakly
in emission, but there is also broad H2O absorption. Gaia 19ajj exhibited a

evaluate the load balancing performance of storage schemes in which each object
is stored at $d$ different nodes, and each node stores the same number of
objects. In our model, the load offered for the objects is sampled uniformly at
random from all the load vectors with a fixed cumulative value. We find that
the load balance in a system of $n$ nodes improves multiplicatively with $d$ as
long as $d = o\left(\log(n)\right)$, and improves exponentially once $d =
\Theta\left(\log(n)\right)$. We show that the load balance improves in the same
way with $d$ when the service choices are created with XOR's of $r$ objects
rather than object replicas. In such redundancy schemes, storage overhead is
reduced multiplicatively by $r$. However, recovery of an object requires
downloading content from $r$ nodes. At the same time, the load balance
increases additively by $r$. We express the system's load balance in terms of
the maximal spacing or maximum of $d$ consecutive spacings between the ordered
statistics of uniform random variables. Using this connection and the limit
results on the maximal $d$-spacings, we derive our main results.

light curves from simply knowing the magnetosphere's mass density distribution.
We exploit the newly-developed Analytical Dynamical Magnetosphere model (ADM)

readily conduct a parameter space study. For validation purposes, we first
apply our algorithm to HD 191612, the prototypical Of?p star. Next, we attempt
to model the photometric variability of the Of?p-type stars identified in the

tensions and conflict. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to better
understand at a granular level how Islamophobia manifests online and who
produces it. We investigate the dynamics of Islamophobia amongst followers of a
prominent UK far right political party on Twitter, the British National Party.
Analysing a new data set of five million tweets, collected over a period of one
year, using a machine learning classifier and latent Markov modelling, we
identify seven types of Islamophobic far right actors, capturing qualitative,
quantitative and temporal differences in their behaviour. Notably, we show that
a small number of users are responsible for most of the Islamophobia that we
observe. We then discuss the policy implications of this typology in the
context of social media regulation.

plane and diverging waves for ultrafast imaging. One remaining challenge
consists in the correction of phase and amplitude aberrations induced during
propagation through complex layers. Unlike conventional line-per-line imaging,
ultrafast ultrasound provides for each transmission, backscattering information
from the whole imaged area. Here, we take benefit from this feature and propose
an efficient approach to perform fast aberration correction based on the
Singular Value Decomposition of an ultrafast compound matrix built from
backscattered data for several plane wave transmissions. First, we explain the
physical signification of SVD and associated singular vectors within the
ultrafast matrix formalism. We theoretically demonstrate that the spatial and
angular variables separation, rendered by SVD on ultrafast data, provides an
elegant and straightforward way to optimize angular coherence of backscattered
data. In heterogeneous media with an aberrating phase screen approximation, we
demonstrate that the first spatial and angular singular vectors retrieve on one
side the non-aberrated image, and on the other, the phase and amplitude of the
aberration law. In vitro results prove the efficiency of the image correction,
but also the accuracy of the aberrator determination. Based on spatial and
angular coherence, we introduce a complete methodology for adaptive beamforming
of ultrafast data, performed on successive isoplanatism patches undergoing SVD
beamforming. The simplicity of this method paves the way to real-time adaptive
ultrafast ultrasound imaging and provides a theoretical framework for future
quantitative ultrasound applications.

short-term outcomes can lead to increased precision and reduced sample size. We
examine the impact of such adjustment in group sequential designs, i.e.,
designs with preplanned interim analyses where enrollment may be stopped early
for efficacy or futility. We address the following questions: how much
precision gain can be obtained by appropriately adjusting for baseline
variables and a short-term outcome? How is this precision gain impacted by
factors such as the proportion of pipeline participants (those who enrolled but
haven't yet had their primary outcomes measured) and treatment effect
heterogeneity? What is the resulting impact on power and average sample size in
a group sequential design? We derive an asymptotic formula that decomposes the
overall precision gain from adjusting for baseline variables and a short-term
outcome into contributions from factors mentioned above, for efficient
estimators in the model that only assumes randomization and independent
censoring. We use our formula to approximate the precision gain from a targeted
minimum loss-based estimator applied to data from a completed trial of a new
surgical intervention for stroke. Our formula implies that (for an efficient
estimator) adjusting for a prognostic baseline variable leads to at least as
much asymptotic precision gain as adjusting for an equally prognostic
short-term outcome. In many cases, such as our stroke trial application, the
former leads to substantially greater precision gains than the latter. In our
simulation study, we show how precision gains from adjustment can be converted
into sample size reductions (even when there is no treatment effect).

the use of voltage source converter (VSC) interfaced battery energy storage

However, the impact of VSCs on the dynamics of reduced-inertia grids is not
well understood especially with respect to large transmission grids interfacing
a mix of rotating machines and resources interfaced with power electronics. In
this regards, we propose an extension of the IEEE 39-bus test network used to

reduced-inertia 39-bus system is obtained by replacing 4 synchronous generators
in the original 10-synchronous machine system, with 4 wind power plants modeled
as aggregated type-3 wind turbines. Then, a large-scale BESS is integrated into
the reduced-inertia network via a three-level neutral-point clamped (NPC)

the inertia-reduced power system, as well as for comparing different VSC
controls. The proposed models are implemented on a real-time simulator to
conduct post-contingency analysis, respectively, for the original power system

indicate that the anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling effects can accurately
describe the anomalously large macroscopic diffusion coefficients in the bcc

formed to scan intended angular sectors, the joint angle-delay sparsity map
together with power intensities of each user channels are obtained by using a
novel constant false alarm rate thresholding algorithm inspired from adaptive
radar detection theory. The proposed thresholding algorithm employs a
spatio-temporal adaptive matched filter type estimator, taking the strong
interference due to simultaneously active multipath components of different
user channels into account, in order to estimate JADPP of each user. After
applying the proposed thresholding algorithm on the estimated power profile,
the angle-delay sparsity map of the massive MIMO channel is constructed, based
on which the channel covariance matrices (CCMs) are formed with significantly
reduced amount of training snapshots. Then, by using the estimated CCMs, the
analog beamformer is reconstructed by means of a virtual sectorization while
taking the inter-group and inter-symbol interference into account. Finally, for
the second mode of operation, two novel reduced-rank instantaneous channel
estimators, operating in a proper beamspace formed by the hybrid structure, are
proposed. The proposed beam and channel acquisition techniques attain the
channel estimation accuracy of minimum mean square error filter with true
knowledge of CCMs.

supports correlated multi-photon bound states, which have a well-defined photon
number $n$ and propagate through the system with a group delay scaling as
$1/n^2$. This has the interesting consequence that, during propagation, an
incident coherent state pulse breaks up into different bound state components
that can become spatially separated at the output in a sufficiently long
system. For sufficiently many photons and sufficiently short systems, we show
that linear combinations of $n$-body bound states recover the well-known
phenomenon of mean-field solitons in self-induced transparency. For longer
systems, however, the solitons break apart through quantum correlated dynamics.
Our work thus covers the entire spectrum from few-photon quantum propagation,
to genuine quantum many-body (atom and photon) phenomena, and ultimately the
quantum-to-classical transition. Finally, we demonstrate that the bound states
can undergo elastic scattering with additional photons. Together, our results
demonstrate that photon bound states are truly distinct physical objects

the trajectory equations is established by invoking the relativity of the
trajectory label. We show how these results extend to the inclusion of external

implies continuity equations for currents with non-negative densities, for
which the Dirac current defines the mean flow. This provides an alternative
trajectory construction of free evolution. Finally, we examine the polar
representation of the Dirac equation, which also implies a non-negative
conserved density but does not map into a stand-alone trajectory theory. It
reveals how the quantum potential is tacit in the Dirac equation.

Atacama Large Millimeter Array we put observational constraints on the physical
location of COMs in a high-mass protostellar envelope associated with the
G328.2551-0.5321 clump. The protostar is single down to ~400au scales and we
resolve the emission region of COMs. Using thermodynamic equilibrium modelling
of the available 7.5 GHz bandwidth around ~345 GHz, we detect emission from 10
COMs, and identify a line of deuterated water (HDO). The most extended emission
originates from methanol, methyl formate and formamide. Together with HDO,
these molecules are found to be associated with both the accretion shocks and
the inner envelope, for which we estimate a moderate temperature of $T_{\rm
kin}\sim$110 K. Our findings reveal a significant difference in the
distribution of COMs. O-bearing COMs, such as ethanol, acetone, and ethylene
glycol are almost exclusively found and show a higher abundance towards the
accretion shocks with $T_{\rm kin}\sim$180 K. Whereas N-bearing COMs with a CN
group, such as vinyl and ethyl cyanide peak on the central position, thus the
protostar and the accretion disk. This is the first observational evidence for
a large column density of COMs seen towards accretion shocks at the centrifugal
barrier at the inner envelope. Since the molecular composition is dominated by
that of the accretion shocks and the radiatively heated hot inner region is
very compact, we propose this source to be a precursor to a classical,
radiatively heated hot core.

of the model is trained first and then held static to train the team--developer

team--developer relationships is based on an organizational chart (org chart),

develop optical tweezers allowing capture, hold, and controllable displacement
of submicronsize particles and biological structures. However, the momentum
conservation law imposes a fundamental restriction on the optical pressure to
be repulsive in paraxial fields. Although different approaches to get around
this restriction have been proposed, they are rather sophisticated and rely on
either wavefront engineering or utilize active media. Herein, we revisit the
issue of optical forces by their analytic continuation to the complex frequency
plane and considering their behavior in transient. We show that the exponential
excitation at the complex frequency offers an intriguing ability to achieve a
pulling force for a passive resonator of any shape and composition even in the
paraxial approximation, the remarkable effect which is not reduced to the
Fourier transform. The approach is linked to the virtual gain effect when an
appropriate transient decay of the excitation signal makes it weaker than the
outgoing signal that carries away greater energy and momentum flux density. The
approach is implemented for the Fabry-Perot cavity and a high refractive index
dielectric nanoparticle, a fruitful platform for intracellular spectroscopy and
lab-on-a-chip technologies where the proposed technique may found unprecedented
capabilities.

task due to large cross-modality variations between RGB and IR images. Most
conventional approaches aim to bridge the cross-modality gap with feature
alignment by feature representation learning. Different from existing methods,
in this paper, we propose a novel and end-to-end Alignment Generative
Adversarial Network (AlignGAN) for the RGB-IR RE-ID task. The proposed model
enjoys several merits. First, it can exploit pixel alignment and feature
alignment jointly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
model the two alignment strategies jointly for the RGB-IR RE-ID problem.
Second, the proposed model consists of a pixel generator, a feature generator,
and a joint discriminator. By playing a min-max game among the three
components, our model is able to not only alleviate the cross-modality and
intra-modality variations but also learn identity-consistent features.
Extensive experimental results on two standard benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed model performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods. Especially,
on SYSU-MM01 dataset, our model can achieve an absolute gain of 15.4% and 12.9%
in terms of Rank-1 and mAP.

for estimating the parameter of interest. Although, the point estimator of the
design is unbiased and efficient, an unbiased variance estimator does not
exist. A common practice to solve this is to collapse or combine the two
adjacent strata, but the attained estimator of variance is not design-unbiased,
and the bias increases as the population means of the collapsed strata become
more variant. Therefore, the one PSU per stratum design with collapsed stratum
variance estimator might not be a good choice, and some statisticians prefer a
design in which two PSUs per stratum are selected. In this paper, we first
compare a one PSU per stratum design to a two PSUs per stratum design. Then, we
propose an empirical Bayes estimator for the variance of one PSU per stratum
design, where it over-shrinks towards the prior mean. To protect against this,
we investigate the potential of a constrained empirical Bayes estimator.
Through a simulation study, we show that the empirical Bayes and constrained
empirical Bayes estimators outperform the classical collapsed one in terms of
empirical relative mean squared error.

significant increases in data available for analysis. Topological data analysis
(TDA) is an emerging area of mathematical research that can identify structures
in these data sets. Here we develop a TDA method to detect physical structures
in a cell that persist over time. In most cells, protein filaments (actin)
interact with motor proteins (myosins) and organize into polymer networks and
higher-order structures. An example of these structures are ring channels that
maintain constant diameters over time and play key roles in processes such as
cell division, development, and wound healing. The interactions of actin with
myosin can be challenging to investigate experimentally in living systems,
given limitations in filament visualization \textit{in vivo}. We therefore use
complex agent-based models that simulate mechanical and chemical interactions
of polymer proteins in cells. To understand how filaments organize into
structures, we propose a TDA method that assesses effective ring generation in
data consisting of simulated actin filament positions through time. We analyze
the topological structure of point clouds sampled along these actin filaments
and propose an algorithm for connecting significant topological features in
time. We introduce visualization tools that allow the detection of dynamic ring
structure formation. This method provides a rigorous way to investigate how

maximal generator loss. In practice, gradient penalties are used to regularize
the discriminator. However, this needs a metric on the space of images that
captures visual similarity. Such a metric is not known, which explains the
limited success of gradient penalties in stabilizing GANs. We argue that the
performance of GANs is instead due to the implicit competitive regularization
(ICR) arising from the simultaneous optimization of generator and
discriminator. ICR promotes solutions that look real to the discriminator and
thus leverages its inductive biases to generate realistic images. We show that
opponent-aware modelling of generator and discriminator, as present in
competitive gradient descent (CGD), can significantly strengthen ICR and thus
stabilize GAN training without explicit regularization. In our experiments, we
use an existing implementation of WGAN-GP and show that by training it with CGD
we can improve the inception score (IS) on CIFAR10 for a wide range of

combining CGD with the WGAN-loss, without any explicit regularization.

separation and the large minimum masses of the planets close encounters may
occur within the time baseline of the observations, thus, a more accurate
N-body dynamical modeling of the available data is performed. The dynamical
best-fit solution leads to collision of the planets and we explore the
long-term stable configuration of the system in a Bayesian framework,
confirming that 13% of the posterior samples are stable for at least 10 Myr.
The result from the stability analysis indicates that the two-planets are

and stochastic optimization. Recent works have shown that utilizing both
decentralized computing and local stochastic gradient estimates can outperform
state-of-the-art centralized algorithms, in applications involving highly
non-convex problems, such as training deep neural networks.
  In this work, we propose a decentralized stochastic algorithm to deal with
certain smooth non-convex problems where there are $m$ nodes in the system, and
each node has a large number of samples (denoted as $n$). Differently from the
majority of the existing decentralized learning algorithms for either
stochastic or finite-sum problems, our focus is given to both reducing the
total communication rounds among the nodes, while accessing the minimum number
of local data samples. In particular, we propose an algorithm named D-GET
(decentralized gradient estimation and tracking), which jointly performs
decentralized gradient estimation (which estimates the local gradient using a
subset of local samples) and gradient tracking (which tracks the global full
gradient using local estimates). We show that, to achieve certain $\epsilon$
stationary solution of the deterministic finite sum problem, the proposed
algorithm achieves an $\mathcal{O}(mn^{1/2}\epsilon^{-1})$ sample complexity
and an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ communication complexity. These bounds
significantly improve upon the best existing bounds of
$\mathcal{O}(mn\epsilon^{-1})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, respectively.
Similarly, for online problems, the proposed method achieves an $\mathcal{O}(m

  Yong-Jin Han","Deep Kernels with Probabilistic Embeddings for Small-Data Learning",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gaussian Processes (GPs) are known to provide accurate predictions and
uncertainty estimates even with small amounts of labeled data by capturing
similarity between data points through their kernel function. However
traditional GP kernels are not very effective at capturing similarity between
high dimensional data points. Neural networks can be used to learn good
representations that encode intricate structures in high dimensional data, and
can be used as inputs to the GP kernel. However the huge data requirement of
neural networks makes this approach ineffective in small data settings. To
solves the conflicting problems of representation learning and data efficiency,
we propose to learn deep kernels on probabilistic embeddings by using a
probabilistic neural network. Our approach maps high-dimensional data to a
probability distribution in a low dimensional subspace and then computes a
kernel between these distributions to capture similarity. To enable end-to-end
learning, we derive a functional gradient descent procedure for training the
model. Experiments on a variety of datasets show that our approach outperforms
the state-of-the-art in GP kernel learning in both supervised and
semi-supervised settings. We also extend our approach to other small-data
paradigms such as few-shot classification where it outperforms previous
approaches on mini-Imagenet and CUB datasets.

systematically examined the impact of network topology on the efficiency of

feature---the modular structure---strongly affects the speed of information
diffusion in complex contagion. Our simulations show that there always exists
an optimal network modularity for the most efficient spreading process. Beyond
this critical value, either a stronger or a weaker modular structure actually
hinders the diffusion speed. These results are confirmed by an analytical
approximation. We further demonstrate that the optimal modularity varies with
both the seed size and the target cascade size, and is ultimately dependent on
the network under investigation. We underscore the importance of our findings

frameworks that optimize the summation of their corresponding losses. Our main
idea is to learn a single unified task with respect to the joint distribution
of the original and self-supervised labels, i.e., we augment original labels
via self-supervision of input transformation. This simple, yet effective
approach allows to train models easier by relaxing a certain invariant
constraint during learning the original and self-supervised tasks
simultaneously. It also enables an aggregated inference which combines the
predictions from different augmentations to improve the prediction accuracy.
Furthermore, we propose a novel knowledge transfer technique, which we refer to
as self-distillation, that has the effect of the aggregated inference in a
single (faster) inference. We demonstrate the large accuracy improvement and

role in many quantum systems. In gapped Bernal bilayer graphene, the Berry
phase can be continuously tuned from zero to 2pi, which offers a unique
opportunity to explore the tunable Berry phase on the physical phenomena. Here,
we report experimental observation of Berry phases-induced valley splitting and
crossing in moveable bilayer graphene p-n junction resonators. In our
experiment, the bilayer graphene resonators are generated by combining the
electric field of scanning tunneling microscope tip with the gap of bilayer
graphene. A perpendicular magnetic field changes the Berry phase of the
confined bound states in the resonators from zero to 2pi continuously and leads
to the Berry phase difference for the two inequivalent valleys in the bilayer
graphene. As a consequence, we observe giant valley splitting and unusual
valley crossing of the lowest bound states. Our results indicate that the
bilayer graphene resonators can be used to manipulate the valley degree of
freedom in valleytronics.

  Layer-wise Training for Deep Linear Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.LG cs.NA math.NA stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Deep neural networks have been used in various machine learning applications
and achieved tremendous empirical successes. However, training deep neural
networks is a challenging task. Many alternatives have been proposed in place
of end-to-end back-propagation. Layer-wise training is one of them, which
trains a single layer at a time, rather than trains the whole layers
simultaneously. In this paper, we study a layer-wise training using a block
coordinate gradient descent (BCGD) for deep linear networks. We establish a
general convergence analysis of BCGD and found the optimal learning rate, which
results in the fastest decrease in the loss. More importantly, the optimal
learning rate can directly be applied in practice, as it does not require any
prior knowledge. Thus, tuning the learning rate is not needed at all. Also, we
identify the effects of depth, width, and initialization in the training
process. We show that when the orthogonal-like initialization is employed, the
width of intermediate layers plays no role in gradient-based training, as long
as the width is greater than or equal to both the input and output dimensions.
We show that under some conditions, the deeper the network is, the faster the
convergence is guaranteed. This implies that in an extreme case, the global
optimum is achieved after updating each weight matrix only once. Besides, we
found that the use of deep networks could drastically accelerate convergence
when it is compared to those of a depth 1 network, even when the computational
cost is considered. Numerical examples are provided to justify our theoretical
findings and demonstrate the performance of layer-wise training by BCGD.

experimentally realized in the fcc phase of LaH$_{10}$ under megabar pressures.
This SC of compressed LaH$_{10}$ has been explained in terms of strong
electron-phonon coupling (EPC), but the mechanism of how the large EPC constant
and high superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ are attained has
not yet been clearly identified. Based on the density-functional theory and the
Migdal-Eliashberg formalism, we reveal the presence of two nodeless,
anisotropic superconducting gaps on the Fermi surface (FS). Here, the small gap
is mostly associated with the hybridized states of H $s$ and La $f$ orbitals on
the three outer FS sheets, while the large gap arises mainly from the
hybridized state of neighboring H $s$ or $p$ orbitals on the one inner FS
sheet. Further, we find that the EPC constant of compressed YH$_{10}$ with the
same sodalite-like clathrate structure is enhanced due to the two additional FS
sheets, leading to a higher $T_{\rm c}$ than LaH$_{10}$. It is thus
demonstrated that the multiband pairing of hybridized electronic states is
responsible for the large EPC constant and room-temperature SC in compressed
hydrides LaH$_{10}$ and YH$_{10}$.

the developer experience could be greatly improved if such code could somehow
be parsed & typed; this makes such code more amenable to use within IDEs and
allows early detection and repair of potential errors. We introduce a lenient
parser, which can parse & type fragments, even ones with simple errors.
Training a machine learner to leniently parse and type imperfect code requires
a large training set including many pairs of imperfect code and its repair;
such training sets are limited by human effort and curation. In this paper, we
present a novel, indirectly supervised, approach to train a lenient parser,
without access to such human-curated training data. We leverage the huge corpus
of mostly correct code available on Github, and the massive, efficient learning
capacity of Transformer-based NN architectures. Using GitHub data, we first
create a large dataset of fragments of code and corresponding tree fragments
and type annotations; we then randomly corrupt the input fragments by seeding
errors that mimic corruptions found in STACKOVERFLOW and student data. Using
this data, we train high-capacity transformer models to overcome both
fragmentation and corruption. With this novel approach, we can achieve
reasonable performance on parsing & typing STACKOVERFLOW fragments; we also
demonstrate that our approach performs well on shorter student error program

expansion of place fields and predictions for alignments of grid components. To
understand the information transform across between neocortex, entorhinal

hippocampal indexing theory to investigate how neural dynamics work in the
entorhinal-hippocampal circuit. The inputs of place cells in CA3 are converged
from three grid modules with different grid spacings layer II of MEC by
Bayesian mechanism. We resort to the robot system to test Fourier hypothesis

simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in the large-scale environment.

multiple-network poroelasticity (MPET) equations describing flow in elastic
porous media that is permeated by single or multiple fluid networks. Here, the
focus is on a three-field formulation of the problem in which the displacement
field of the elastic matrix and, additionally, one velocity field and one
pressure field for each of the $n \ge 1$ fluid networks are the unknown
physical quantities. Generalizing Biot's model of consolidation, which is
obtained for $n=1$, the MPET equations for $n\ge1$ exhibit a double saddle
point structure.
  The proposed approach is based on a framework of augmenting and splitting
this three-by-three block system in such a way that the resulting block
Gauss-Seidel preconditioner defines a fully decoupled iterative scheme for the
flux-, pressure-, and displacement fields. In this manner, one obtains an
augmented Lagrangian Uzawa-type method, the analysis of which is the main
contribution of this work. The parameter-robust uniform linear convergence of
this fixed-point iteration is proved by showing that its rate of contraction is
strictly less than one independent of all physical and discretization
parameters.
  The theoretical results are confirmed by a series of numerical tests that
compare the new fully decoupled scheme to the very popular partially decoupled
fixed-stress split iterative method, which decouples only flow--the flux and
pressure fields remain coupled in this case--from the mechanics problem. We
further test the performance of the block triangular preconditioner defining
the new scheme when used to accelerate the GMRES algorithm.

be very important for the transformation. This paper proposes a new
transformation module based on local cues, where the relationship of the local
features is used for transformation. To enhance the generalization performance
of the network, the relationship matrix is calculated in a high-dimensional
metric embedding space based on cosine distance. In addition, to handle the
challenging mapping problem from the low-level local relationships to
high-level semantic cues, we propose to apply generalized inverse matrix of the
annotation matrix of support images to transform the relationship matrix
linearly, which is non-parametric and class-agnostic. The result by the matrix
transformation can be regarded as an attention map with high-level semantic

is unbounded on $L^p(D_{n, m}(\mu), (-\rho)^{\alpha})$, except for the trivial
case $p=2$. In particular, this paper gives an example of an unbounded strongly
pseudoconvex domain whose ordinary Bergman projection is $L^p$ irregular when
$p\in [1,\infty)\setminus\{2\}$. This result turns out to be completely
different from the well-known positive $L^p$ regularity result on bounded

great importance for highly integrated electronic structures such as
electronic, thermoelectric and plasmonic devices where heat dissipation is
dominated by interfacial effects. In this paper we study the modification of
the thermal boundary conductance at metal-dielectric interfaces by inserting
metal interlayers of varying thickness below 10 nm. We show that the insertion
of a tantalum interlayer at the Al/Si and Al/sapphire interfaces strongly
hinders the phonon transmission across these boundaries, with a sharp
transition and plateau within ~1 nm. We show that the electron-phonon coupling
has a major influence on the sharpness of the transition as the interlayer
thickness is varied, and if the coupling is strong, the variation in thermal
boundary conductance typically saturates within 2 nm. In contrast, the addition
of a nickel interlayer at the Al/Si and the Al/sapphire interfaces produces a
local minimum as the interlayer thickness increases, due to the similar phonon
dispersion in Ni and Al. The weaker electron-phonon coupling in Ni causes the
boundary conductance to saturate more slowly. Thermal property measurements
were performed using time domain thermo-reflectance and are in good agreement
with a formulation of the diffuse mismatch model based on real phonon
dispersions that accounts for inelastic phonon scattering and phonon
confinement within the interlayer. The analysis of the different assumptions
included in the model reveals when inelastic processes should be considered. A
hybrid model that introduces inelastic scattering only when the materials are
more acoustically matched is found to better predict the thickness dependence
of the thermal boundary conductance without any fitting parameters.

ranking from pairwise comparison data with ties has attracted increasing
interest in recent years. However, in real-world scenarios, different
individuals often hold distinct preferences. It might be misleading to merely
look at a global partial ranking while ignoring personal diversity. In this
paper, instead of learning a global ranking which is agreed with the consensus,
we pursue the tie-aware partial ranking from an individualized perspective.
Particularly, we formulate a unified framework which not only can be used for
individualized partial ranking prediction, but also be helpful for abnormal
user selection. This is realized by a variable splitting-based algorithm called
\ilbi. Specifically, our algorithm generates a sequence of estimations with a
regularization path, where both the hyperparameters and model parameters are
updated. At each step of the path, the parameters can be decomposed into three
orthogonal parts, namely, abnormal signals, personalized signals and random
noise. The abnormal signals can serve the purpose of abnormal user selection,
while the abnormal signals and personalized signals together are mainly
responsible for individual partial ranking prediction. Extensive experiments on
simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that our new approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives. The code is now

inherently present in 3D point clouds, researchers have been shifting their
focus from the design of hand-craft point feature towards the learning of 3D
point signatures using deep neural networks for 3D point cloud classification.
Recent proposed deep learning based point cloud classification methods either
apply 2D CNN on projected feature images or apply 1D convolutional layers
directly on raw point sets. These methods cannot adequately recognize
fine-grained local structures caused by the uneven density distribution of the
point cloud data. In this paper, to address this challenging issue, we
introduced a density-aware convolution module which uses the point-wise density
to re-weight the learnable weights of convolution kernels. The proposed
convolution module is able to fully approximate the 3D continuous convolution
on unevenly distributed 3D point sets. Based on this convolution module, we
further developed a multi-scale fully convolutional neural network with
downsampling and upsampling blocks to enable hierarchical point feature
learning. In addition, to regularize the global semantic context, we
implemented a context encoding module to predict a global context encoding and
formulated a context encoding regularizer to enforce the predicted context
encoding to be aligned with the ground truth one. The overall network can be
trained in an end-to-end fashion with the raw 3D coordinates as well as the
height above ground as inputs. Experiments on the International Society for

the superiority of the proposed method for point cloud classification. Our

simultaneously useful for multiple users in a broadcast channel. Later,
Georgiadis and Tassiulas studied erasure broadcast channels with feedback, and
presented the capacity region under certain assumptions. These results provided
the fundamental ideas used in communication protocols for networks with delayed
channel state information. However, to the best of our knowledge, the capacity
region of erasure broadcast channels with feedback and with a common message
for both receivers has never been presented. This latter problem shows up as a
sub-problem in many multi-terminal communication networks such as the
X-Channel, and the two-unicast problem. In this work, we present the capacity
region of the two-user erasure broadcast channels with delayed feedback,
private messages, and a common message. We consider arbitrary and possibly
correlated erasure distributions. We develop new outer-bounds that capture
feedback and quantify the impact of delivering a common message on the capacity
region. We also propose a transmission strategy that achieves the outer-bounds.
Our transmission strategy differs from prior results in that to achieve the
capacity, it creates side-information at the weaker user such that the
decodability is ensured even if we multicast the common message with a rate
higher than its link capacity.

performance thanks to recent advances in deep learning and the availability of

theory, deep neural model and domain knowledge concern for ATS. This
architecture mainly contains three components: domain knowledge base
construction based on representation learning, attentional encoder-decoder
model for rhetorical parsing and subroutine-based model for text summarization.
Domain knowledge can be effectively used for unsupervised rhetorical parsing
thus rhetorical structure trees for each document can be derived. In the
unsupervised rhetorical parsing module, the idea of translation was adopted to
alleviate the problem of data scarcity. The subroutine-based summarization
model purely depends on the derived rhetorical structure trees and can generate
content-balanced results. To evaluate the summary results without golden

were tuned by supervised learning. Experimental results show that, on a

In this work, we propose to use the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy

predicted theoretically based on the collective coordinate theory, which is
confirmed by the atomistic micromagnetic simulations. The antiferromagnetic
spin dynamics is realized at the angular momentum compensation point, and the
wall shifting has a constant speed under small gradient and can be slightly
accelerated under large gradient due to the broadened wall width during the
motion. For nonzero net angular momentum, the Walker breakdown occurs at a
critical anisotropy gradient significantly depending on the second anisotropy
and interfacial Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya interaction, which is highly appreciated
for further experiments including the materials selection and device geometry
design. More importantly, this work unveils a low-power-consuming method of
controlling the domain wall in ferrimagnets, benefiting to future spintronic

been proved one of the best models to probe the exotic structures in deformed
nuclei. In DRHBc, the potentials and densities are expressed in terms of the
multipole expansion with Legendre polynomials, the dependence on which has only
been touched for light nuclei so far. In this paper, taking a light nucleus
$^{20}$Ne and a heavy nucleus $^{242}$U as examples, we investigated the
dependence on the multipole expansion of the potentials and densities in DRHBc.
It is shown that the total energy converges well with the expansion truncation
both in the absence of and presence of the pairing correlation, either in the
ground state or at a constrained quadrupole deformation. It is found that to
reach a same accuracy of the total energy, even to a same relative accuracy by
percent, a larger truncation is required by a heavy nucleus than a light one.
The dependence of the total energy on the truncation increases with
deformation. By decompositions of the neutron density distribution, it is shown
that a higher-order component has a smaller contribution. With the increase of
deformation, the high-order components get larger, while at the same
deformation, the high-order components of a heavy nucleus play a more important
role than that of a light one.

Polarimeter at the 70 cm German Vacuum Tower Telescope were combined with data
from the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly to
identify the processes that triggered the flare. The legs of this arch filament
were anchored in the leading sunspot and the network flux region of opposite
polarity. The flare was driven by small-scale, flux cancellation at the weak
neutral line underlying the arch filament which resulted in two small flaring
events within an hour of the C1.1 flare. Flux cancellation was facilitated by
the moat flow from the leading sunspot wherein small-scale magnetic fragments
stream towards patches of pre-existing flux. The cancellation of flux led to
the destabilization of the arch filament which was seen as an increase in the
twist along the arch filament. The horizontal fields across the weak neutral
line decay faster which cannot prevent the filament from rising that results in
a two-ribbon flare at the neutral line. The arch filament unwinds as it rises,
but is confined by the higher, overlying fields between the two polarities of
the active region that decay much more slowly.

positive curvature, where $C$ is the number of classes; (2) gradient directions
are largely confined to this extremely low dimensional subspace of positive
Hessian curvature, leaving the vast majority of directions in weight space

training can be successful even when confined to low dimensional {\it random}

we can obtain a suitable feature space. Nevertheless, while K-Means is one of
the most efficient offline clustering algorithms, it is not equipped to
estimate the number of clusters, which is useful in some practical cases. Other
practical methods which do are simply too complex, as they require at least one
run of K-Means for each possible K. In order to address this issue, we propose
a K-Means initialization similar to K-Means++, which would be able to estimate
K based on the feature space while finding suitable initial centroids for
K-Means in a deterministic manner. Then we compare the proposed method,
DISCERN, with a few of the most practical K estimation methods, while also
comparing clustering results of K-Means when initialized randomly, using
K-Means++ and using DISCERN. The results show improvement in both the
estimation and final clustering performance.

attention in the field -- with several methods proposed based on transmission
mode tomography. SoS imaging using conventional ultrasound (US) systems would
be convenient and easy for clinical translation, but this requires using
conventional US probes with single-sides tissue access and thus pulse-echo
imaging sequences. Recent pulse-echo SoS imaging methods rely on plane wave
(PW) insonifications, which is prone to strong aberration effects for
non-homogeneous tissue composition. In this paper we propose to use diverging
waves (DW) for SoS imaging and thus substantially improve the reconstruction of
SoS distributions. We study this proposition by first plane wavefront
aberrations compared to DW. We then present the sensitivity of both approaches
to major parameterization choices on a set of simulated phantoms. Using the
optimum parameter combination for each method for a given transducer model and
imaging sequence, we analyze the SoS imaging performance comparatively between
the two approaches. Results indicate that using DW instead of PW, the
reconstruction accuracy improves substantially, by over 22% in reconstruction
error (RMSE) and by 55% in contrast (CNR). We also demonstrate improvements in
SoS reconstructions from an actual US acquisition of a breast phantom with
tumor- and cyst-representative inclusions, with high and low SoS contrast,

stability and revenue optimization. To overcome these obstacles, PV forecasting
became an area of intense research. In this paper, we propose a low complexity
forecasting model able to operate with multiple heterogenous sources of data
(power measurements, satellite images and Numerical Weather Predictions (NWP)).
Being non-parametric, this model can be extended to include inputs. The main
strength of the proposed model lies in its ability to automatically select the
optimal sources of data according to the desired forecast horizon (from 15min
to 6h ahead) thanks to a feature selection procedure. To take advantage of the
growing number of PV plants, a Spatio-Temporal (ST) approach is implemented.
This approach considers the dependencies between spatially distributed plants.
Each source has been studied incrementally so as to quantify their impact on
forecast performances. This plurality of sources enhances the forecasting
performances up to 40% in terms of RMSE compared to a reference model. The
evaluation process is carried out on nine PV plants from the Compagnie

that about 1% of the bulge stars have rather high nitrogen abundances
([N/Fe]>0.5). We here numerically investigate in what physical conditions these
N-rich stars (NRS) can be formed in spherical and disky stellar systems with
stellar masses of 10^7-10^9 M_sun that are the bulge's building blocks. The
principal results are as follows. A large fraction (>0.5) of new stars formed
from interstellar medium polluted (ISM) by ejecta of asymptotic giant branch
stars can have [N/Fe]>0.5 within stellar systems, if the gas mass fraction of
ISM (f_g) is low (< 0.03). The mass fraction of NRS among all stars (f_nrs) can
be higher than 1% within 0.5 Gyr timescale of star formation, if the mean
stellar densities (rho_s) of the systems are higher than 0.1 M_sun/ pc^3. The
[N/Fe] distributions depend on rho_s, f_g, and age distributions of their host
stellar systems. NRS have compact and disky spatial distributions within their
host systems and have rotational kinematics. Based on these results, we propose
that the vast majority of the bulge's NRS originate not from globular clusters
(GCs) but from its high-density building blocks. We suggest that NRS in the
Galactic stellar halo have the same origin as those in the bulge. We also

The liquid crystal is confined in a thin region between two plates,

field is at equilibrium due to the negative anisotropy of the media. However,
such a state is unstable to perturbations that manifest themselves as confined,
bullet-like, director distortions traveling up and down the sample at a speed

waves through long-term measurements of pulse arrival times from an ensemble of
millisecond pulsars. After years of observations, some timing array pulsars
have been shown to be dominated by low-frequency red noise, including spin
noise that might be associated with pulsar rotational irregularities. The power
spectral density of pulsar timing red noise is usually modeled with a power law
or a power law with a turnover frequency below which the noise power spectrum
plateaus. If there is a turnover in the spin noise of millisecond pulsars,
residing within the observation band of current and/or future pulsar timing
measurements, it may be easier than projected to resolve the gravitational-wave
background from supermassive binary black holes. Additionally, the spectral
turnover can provide valuable insights on neutron star physics. In the recent
study by Melatos and Link, the authors provided a derivation of the model for
power spectral density of spin noise from superfluid turbulence in the core of
a neutron star, from first principles. The model features a spectral turnover,
which depends on the dynamical response time of the superfluid and the
steady-state angular velocity lag between the crust and the core of the star.
In this work, we search for a spectral turnover in spin noise using the first
data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array. Through Bayesian model
selection, we find no evidence of a spectral turnover. Our analysis also shows
that data from pulsars J1939+2134, J1024$-$0719 and J1713+0747 prefers the
power-law model to the superfluid turbulence model.

two-dimensional, with negligible dispersion along the c-axis. Due to n-type

the minimum indirect (0.97 eV) and direct (1.46 eV) bandgaps. We find the Fermi

with sharp in-plane dispersion about the $\overline{M}$ points, yielding
effective masses of 0.21 $m_{0}$ along $\overline{KM}$ and 0.33 $m_{0}$ along

efficient completion method by utilizing the sparsity structure of observed

the mean-field geometry leads to a negative binomial law for the number of
particles at each site, with parameters depending on the hopping, creation and
annihilation rates. This model can be mapped to population dynamics (if the
creation rates are reproductive fitnesses in a haploid population, and the

width, depth and sample size when the network has random weights and is
sufficiently wide. This study covers two widely-used FIMs for regression with
linear output and for classification with softmax output. Both FIMs
asymptotically show pathological eigenvalue spectra in the sense that a small
number of eigenvalues become large outliers depending the width or sample size
while the others are much smaller. It implies that the local shape of the
parameter space or loss landscape is very sharp in a few specific directions
while almost flat in the other directions. In particular, the softmax output
disperses the outliers and makes a tail of the eigenvalue density spread from
the bulk. We also show that pathological spectra appear in other variants of
FIMs: one is the neural tangent kernel; another is a metric for the input
signal and feature space that arises from feedforward signal propagation. Thus,
we provide a unified perspective on the FIM and its variants that will lead to
more quantitative understanding of learning in large-scale DNNs.

technique is adopted to fuse multiple feature sets of the same type for
individual cues by taking into account the class structure among the samples
involved to describe the three classical interestingness cues,
unusualness,aesthetics as well as general preferences, with three sets of
compact and representative features; on the other hand, to make good use of the
heterogeneity from the three sets of high-level features for describing the
interestingness cues, the SimpleMKL method is employed to enhance the
generalization ability of the built model for the task of the binary
interestingness classification. Experimental results on the publicly-released
interestingness prediction data set have demonstrated the rationality and
effectiveness of the proposed framework in the binary prediction of image
interestingness where we have conducted several groups of comparative studies
across different interestingness feature combinations, different
interestingness cues, as well as different feature types for the three
interestingness cues.

  Descent: When Is the Linear Speedup Achieved?",,,,,"cs.LG math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In machine learning, asynchronous parallel stochastic gradient descent
(APSGD) is broadly used to speed up the training process through multi-workers.
Meanwhile, the time delay of stale gradients in asynchronous algorithms is
generally proportional to the total number of workers, which brings additional
deviation from the accurate gradient due to using delayed gradients. This may
have a negative influence on the convergence of the algorithm. One may ask: How
many workers can we use at most to achieve a good convergence and the linear
speedup?
  In this paper, we consider the second-order convergence of asynchronous
algorithms in non-convex optimization. We investigate the behaviors of APSGD
with consistent read near strictly saddle points and provide a theoretical
guarantee that if the total number of workers is bounded by
$\widetilde{O}(K^{1/3}M^{-1/3})$ ($K$ is the total steps and $M$ is the
mini-batch size), APSGD will converge to good stationary points ($||\nabla
f(x)||\leq \epsilon, \nabla^2 f(x)\succeq -\sqrt{\epsilon}\bm{I},
\epsilon^2\leq O(\sqrt{\frac{1}{MK}}) $) and the linear speedup is achieved.
Our works give the first theoretical guarantee on the second-order convergence
for asynchronous algorithms. The technique we provide can be generalized to
analyze other types of asynchronous algorithms to understand the behaviors of
asynchronous algorithms in distributed asynchronous parallel training.

Such a problem arises in crowdsourcing platforms solving large-scale labeling

label images. In our inference problem, items are grouped into initially
unknown non-overlapping clusters. To recover these clusters, the learner
sequentially presents to users a finite list of items together with a question
with a binary answer selected from a fixed finite set. For each of these items,
the user provides a noisy answer whose expectation is determined by the item
cluster and the question and by an item-specific parameter characterizing the
{\it hardness} of classifying the item. The objective is to devise an algorithm
with a minimal cluster recovery error rate. We derive problem-specific
information-theoretical lower bounds on the error rate satisfied by any

For uniform selection, we present a simple algorithm built upon the K-means

adaptive selection, we develop an adaptive algorithm that is inspired by the
derivation of the information-theoretical error lower bounds, and in turn
allocates the budget in an efficient way. The algorithm learns to select items
hard to cluster and relevant questions more often. We compare the performance

propagates this information to 3D space, where a consensus method determines

result of the spontaneous breaking of an approximate symmetry such as the axion
and more generally the axion-like particles. In addition to the particle
physics motivations, these particles can also play a major role in cosmology by
contributing to dark matter abundance and affecting the structure formation at
sub-Mpc scales. In this paper, we propose to use the 21cm forest observations
to probe the nature of ultra-light dark matter. The 21cm forest can probe much
smaller scales than the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, that is, $k\gtrsim
10\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We explore the range of the ultra-light dark matter mass
$m_{u}$ and $f_u$, the fraction of ultra-light dark matter with respect to the
total matter, which can be probed by the 21cm forest. We find that 21cm forest
can potentially put the dark matter mass lower bound $m_u \gtrsim 10^{-18}$ eV
for $f_u=1$, which is 3 orders of magnitude bigger mass scale than those probed
by the current Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations.While the effects of the
ultra-light particles on the structure formation become smaller when the
dominant component of dark matter is composed of the conventional cold dark
matter, we find that the 21cm forest is still powerful enough to probe the
sub-component ultra-light dark matter mass up to the order of $10^{-19}$ eV.
The Fisher matrix analysis shows that $(m_u,f_u)\sim (10^{-20}\mathrm{eV},
0.3)$ is the most optimal parameter set which the 21cm forest can probe with
the minimal errors for a sub-component ultra-light dark matter scenario.

air discharges at atmospheric pressure and at the low pressure of the
mesosphere. This approach is useful to investigate the spatial non-uniformity

This characterization of the spatial non-uniformity of the electric field in

methods to estimate the peak electric field in cold plasmas. The commonly
employed method to derive the peak electric field in streamer heads
underestimates the electric field by about 40-50~\% as a consequence of the
high spatial non-uniformity of the electric field. Our diagnostic methods
reduce this underestimation to about 10-20\%. However, our methods are less
accurate than previous methods for streamer glows, where the electric field is
uniformly distributed in space. Finally, we apply our diagnostic methods to the

composed of two processing blocks: the first one is embedded in each vehicle,
and aims at geolocalizing the vehicle and the detected feature marks. The
second is operated on cloud servers, and uses observations from all the
vehicles to compute updates for the map of geo-positioned landmarks. As the
map's landmarks are detected and positioned by more and more vehicles, the
accuracy of the map increases, eventually converging in probability towards a
null error. The landmarks geo-positions are estimated in a stable and scalable
way, enabling to provide dynamic map updates in an automatic manner.

quantum well (DQW) subjected to an electric field are neutral species with a
dipole moment oriented perpendicular to the DQW plane. Here, we theoretically
study interactions between IXs in stacked DQW bilayers, where the dipolar
coupling can be either attractive or repulsive depending on the relative
positions of the particles. By using microscopic band structure calculations to
determine the electronic states forming the excitons, we show that the
attractive dipolar interaction between stacked IXs deforms their electronic
wave function, thereby increasing the inter-DQW interaction energy and making
the IX electrically polarizable. Many-particle effects interaction are
addressed by considering the coupling between a single IX in one of the DQWs to
a cloud of IXs in the other DQW, which is modeled either as a closed-packed
lattice or as a continuum IX fluid. We find that the lattice model yields IX
interlayer binding energies decreasing with increasing lattice density. This
behavior is due to the dominating role of the intra-DQW dipolar repulsion,
which prevents more than one exciton from entering the attractive region of the
inter-DQW coupling. Finally, both models shows that the single IX distorts the
distribution of IXs in the adjacent DQW, thus inducing the formation of an IX
polaron. While the interlayer binding energy reduces with IX density for
lattice polarons, the continuous polaron model predicts a non-monotonous
dependence on density in semi-quantitative agreement with a recent experimental
study [cf. Hubert {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. {\bf X}9, 021026 (2019)].

$\sim-19$) transients interacting with He-rich circumstellar material (CSM). SN
2018bcc, detected by the ZTF shortly after explosion, provides the best
constraints on the shape of the rising light curve (LC) of a fast Type Ibn.
Aims: We used the high-quality data set of SN 2018bcc to study observational
signatures of the class. Additionally, the powering mechanism of SN 2018bcc
offers insights into the debated progenitor connection of Type Ibn SNe.
Methods: We compared well-constrained LC properties obtained from empirical

semi-analytical models powered by radioactive decay and CSM interaction.
Finally, we modeled the line profiles and emissivity of the prominent He I
lines, in order to study the formation of P-Cygni profiles and estimate CSM
properties. Results: SN 2018bcc had a rise time to peak of $5.6^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$
days in the restframe with a rising shape power-law index close to 2, and seems
to be a typical rapidly evolving Type Ibn SN. The spectrum lacked signatures of
SN-like ejecta and was dominated by over 15 He emission features at 20 days
past peak, alongside Ca and Mg, all with V$_{\text{FWHM}} \sim
2000~\text{km}~\text{s}^{-1}$. The luminous and rapidly evolving LC could be
powered by CSM interaction but not by the decay of radioactive $^{56}$Ni.
Modeling of the He I lines indicated a dense and optically thick CSM that can
explain the P-Cygni profiles. Conclusions: Like other rapidly-evolving Type Ibn
SNe, SN 2018bcc is a luminous transient with a rapid rise to peak powered by
shock interaction inside a dense and He-rich CSM. Its spectra do not support
the existence of two Type Ibn spectral classes. We also note the remarkable
observational match to pulsational pair instability (PPI) SN models.

games in which individuals are best off cheating, while groups of individuals
do best when composed of many cooperators. We analyze the dynamics of the
two-level replicator dynamics, a nonlocal hyperbolic PDE describing
deterministic birth-death dynamics for both individuals and groups. While past
work on such multilevel dynamics has restricted attention to scenarios with
exactly solvable within-group dynamics, we use comparison principles and an
invariant property of the tail of the population distribution to extend our
analysis to all possible two-player, two-strategy social dilemmas. We
characterize the threshold level of between-group selection dividing a regime
in which the population converges to a delta function at the equilibrium of the
within-group dynamics from a regime in which between-group competition
facilitates the existence of steady-state densities supporting greater levels
of cooperation. In particular, we see that the threshold selection strength and
average payoff at steady state depend on a tug-of-war between the
individual-level incentive to be a defector in a many-cooperator group and the
group-level incentive to have many cooperators over many defectors. We also
find that lower-level selection casts a long shadow: if groups are best off
with a mix of cooperators and defectors, then there will always be fewer
cooperators than optimal at steady state, even in the limit of infinitely
strong competition between groups.

arises from the polarization of the free interface. The quiet life force
opposes the adiabatic force, which is due to the inhomogeneous density

parsing of freehand sketches, which makes three main contributions that are
experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First, we propose a
homogeneous transformation method to address the problem of domain adaptation.
For the task of sketch parsing, there is no available data of labeled freehand
sketches that can be directly used for model training. An alternative solution
is to learn from datasets of real image parsing, while the domain adaptation is
an inevitable problem. Unlike existing methods that utilize the edge maps of
real images to approximate freehand sketches, the proposed homogeneous
transformation method transforms the data from domains of real images and
freehand sketches into a homogeneous space to minimize the semantic gap.
Second, we design a soft-weighted loss function as guidance for the training
process, which gives attention to both the ambiguous label boundary and class
imbalance. Third, we present a staged learning strategy to improve the parsing
performance of the trained model, which takes advantage of the shared
information and specific characteristic from different sketch categories.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the above three
methods. Specifically, to evaluate the generalization ability of our
homogeneous transformation method, additional experiments for the task of
sketch-based image retrieval are conducted on the QMUL FG-SBIR dataset.
Finally, by integrating the proposed three methods into a unified framework of
deep semantic sketch parsing (DeepSSP), we achieve the state-of-the-art on the
public SketchParse dataset.

MBL phase has distinctive signatures, such as slow dephasing and logarithmic
entanglement growth; they commonly result in slow and subtle modification of
the dynamics, making their measurement challenging. Here, we experimentally
characterize these properties of the MBL phase in a system of coupled
superconducting qubits. By implementing phase sensitive techniques, we map out
the structure of local integrals of motion in the MBL phase. Tomographic
reconstruction of single and two qubit density matrices allowed us to determine
the spatial and temporal entanglement growth between the localized sites. In
addition, we study the preservation of entanglement in the MBL phase. The
interferometric protocols implemented here measure affirmative correlations and
allow us to exclude artifacts due to the imperfect isolation of the system. By
measuring elusive MBL quantities, our work highlights the advantages of phase
sensitive measurements in studying novel phases of matter.

distribution after centering by the efficient estimator and standardizing by
the square root of the total Fisher information is nearly standard normal. In
particular, the prior completely washes out from the asymptotic posterior
distribution. This fact is fundamental and justifies the Bayes approach from
the frequentist viewpoint. In the nonparametric setup the situation changes
dramatically and the impact of prior becomes essential even for the contraction
of the posterior; see [vdV2008], [Bo2011], [CaNi2013,CaNi2014] for different
models like Gaussian regression or i.i.d. model in different weak topologies.
This paper offers another non-asymptotic approach to studying the behavior of
the posterior for a special but rather popular and useful class of statistical
models and for Gaussian priors. First we derive tight finite sample bounds on
posterior contraction in terms of the so called effective dimension of the
parameter space. Our main results describe the accuracy of Gaussian
approximation of the posterior. In particular, we show that restricting to the
class of all centrally symmetric credible sets around pMLE allows to get
Gaussian approximation up to order (n^{-1}). We also show that the posterior
distribution mimics well the distribution of the penalized maximum likelihood
estimator (pMLE) and reduce the question of reliability of credible sets to
consistency of the pMLE-based confidence sets. The obtained results are
specified for nonparametric log-density estimation and generalized regression.

characterize planets formed at different disk radii. There is some evidence
from far-infrared and submillimeter observations that gas in the outer disk is
depleted in carbon, with a corresponding enhancement of carbon-rich ices at the
disk midplane. Observations of the carbon content inside of the inner
sublimation rim could confirm how much carbon remains locked in kilometer size
bodies in the disk. Using near-infrared spectra, I self-consistently determine
the stellar, extinction, veiling, and accretion properties of the 26 stars in

stars and identify a series of C^0 recombination lines in 18 of these disks and
use the CHIANTI atomic line database with an optically thin slab model to
constrain the average n_e, T_e, and n_C for these lines in the five disks with
a complete set of lines. By comparing these values with other slab models of
the inner disk using the Cloudy photoionization code, I also constrain n_H and
the carbon abundance, X_C, and hence the amount of carbon `missing' from the
slab. The inner disks are extremely dense (n_H~10^{16} cm^{-3}), warm (T_e~4500
K), and moderately ionized (logX_e~3.3). Three of the five modeled disks show
robust carbon depletion <=42 relative to the solar value. I discuss multiple
ways in which the `missing' carbon could be locked out of the accreting gas.
Given the high-density inner disk gas, evidence for radial drift, and lack of
obvious gaps in these three systems, their carbon depletion is most consistent
with the `missing' carbon being sequestered in kilometer size bodies. For DR
Tau, nitrogen and silicon are also depleted by factors of 45 and 4,
respectively, suggesting that the kilometer size bodies into which the grains
are locked were formed beyond the N_2 snowline.

planetary and stellar binary systems, but the fluid dynamical mechanisms
responsible remain incompletely understood. One key mechanism is the
interaction between tidal flows and convection. Turbulent convection is thought
to act as an effective viscosity in damping large-scale tidal flows, but there
is a long-standing controversy over the efficiency of this mechanism when the
tidal frequency exceeds the turnover frequency of the dominant convective
eddies. This high frequency regime is relevant for many applications, such as
for tides in stars hosting hot Jupiters. We explore the interaction between
tidal flows and convection using hydrodynamical simulations within a local
Cartesian model of a small patch of a convection zone of a star or planet. We
adopt the Boussinesq approximation and simulate Rayleigh-B\'enard convection,
modelling the tidal flow as a background oscillatory shear flow. We demonstrate
that the effective viscosity of both laminar and turbulent convection is
approximately frequency-independent for low frequencies. When the forcing
frequency exceeds the dominant convective frequency, the effective viscosity
scales inversely with the square of the tidal frequency. We also show that
negative effective viscosities are possible, particularly for high frequency
tidal forcing, suggesting the surprising possibility of tidal anti-dissipation.
These results are supported by a complementary high frequency asymptotic
analysis that extends prior work by Ogilvie & Lesur. We discuss the
implications of these results for interpreting the orbital decay of hot
Jupiters, and for several other astrophysical problems.

reference sentence and a specified answer within the sentence. A major
challenge in QG is to identify answer-relevant context words to finish the
declarative-to-interrogative sentence transformation. Existing
sequence-to-sequence neural models achieve this goal by proximity-based answer
position encoding under the intuition that neighboring words of answers are of
high possibility to be answer-relevant. However, such intuition may not apply
to all cases especially for sentences with complex answer-relevant relations.
Consequently, the performance of these models drops sharply when the relative
distance between the answer fragment and other non-stop sentence words that
also appear in the ground truth question increases. To address this issue, we
propose a method to jointly model the unstructured sentence and the structured
answer-relevant relation (extracted from the sentence in advance) for question
generation. Specifically, the structured answer-relevant relation acts as the
to the point context and it thus naturally helps keep the generated question to
the point, while the unstructured sentence provides the full information.
Extensive experiments show that to the point context helps our question
generation model achieve significant improvements on several automatic
evaluation metrics. Furthermore, our model is capable of generating diverse
questions for a sentence which conveys multiple relations of its answer
fragment.

training data and the substantial intra-class variance of freehand sketches for

availability of the temporal order of sketch strokes, additional cues acquired
from different modalities and supervised augmentation of sketch datasets with
real images, which also limit the applicability and feasibility of these
methods in real scenarios.
  In this paper, we propose a novel sketch-specific data augmentation (SSDA)
method that leverages the quantity and quality of the sketches automatically.
From the aspect of quantity, we introduce a Bezier pivot based deformation
(BPD) strategy to enrich the training data. Towards quality improvement, we
present a mean stroke reconstruction (MSR) approach to generate a set of novel
types of sketches with smaller intra-class variances. Both of these solutions
are unrestricted from any multi-source data and temporal cues of sketches.
Furthermore, we show that some recent deep convolutional neural network models
that are trained on generic classes of real images can be better choices than
most of the elaborate architectures that are designed explicitly for sketch
recognition. As SSDA can be integrated with any convolutional neural networks,
it has a distinct advantage over the existing methods. Our extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the
state-of-the-art results (84.27%) on the TU-Berlin dataset, outperforming the
human performance by a remarkable 11.17% increase. Finally, more experiments
show the practical value of our approach for the task of sketch-based image

role for the detection of topological singularities. We introduce a related
distributional quantity, called the global Jacobian that can detect both
interior and boundary vortices for a $2D$ map $u$. We point out several
features of the global Jacobian, in particular, we prove an important stability
property. This property allows us to study boundary vortices in a $2D$
Ginzburg-Landau model arising in thin ferromagnetic films, where a weak
anchoring boundary energy penalising the normal component of $u$ at the
boundary competes with the usual bulk potential energy. We prove an asymptotic
expansion by $\Gamma$-convergence at the second order for this mixed
boundary/interior energy in a regime where boundary vortices are preferred.
More precisely, at the first order of the limiting expansion, the energy is
quantised and determined by the number of boundary vortices detected by the
global Jacobian, while the second order term in the limiting energy expansion
accounts for the interaction between the boundary vortices.

low latency is also a strong requirement in addition to the trade-off between

the major solutions for video streaming under time-varying network conditions,
which works even better combining with some latency control methods, such as
adaptive playback rate control and frame dropping. However, it still remains a
challenging problem to design an algorithm to combine these adaptation schemes

latency-constrained bitrate control and QoE-oriented adaptive frame dropping.

individual elements of quasidifferentials of the objective function and
constraints and are not invariant with respect to the choise of
quasidifferentials. To illustrate the theoretical results, we present two
simple examples in which optimality conditions in terms of various
subdifferentials (in fact, any outer semicontinuous/limiting subdifferential)
are satisfied at a nonoptimal point, while the optimality conditions obtained
in this paper do not hold true at this point, that is, optimality conditions in

planetary formation can be used, we investigate the migration of a planet in a
two-dimensional, locally isothermal gas disc with a prescribed accretion rate,
analyzing the timescale involved in the planetary migration process along with
the timescale for planetary formation. The analysis reveals that the mass of
the nucleus must be close to its critical value when crossing the ice line to
avoid the planet's fall into the stellar envelope. This will allow enough time
for the planet to initiate runaway gas accretion, leading to a rapid mass
increase and entering type II planetary migration.

give some basic results on the existence and uniqueness on this theme, in
particular our results for conditional monotone mean--variance and conditional
entropic risk measures are complete and deep. As the basis for the work of this
paper, this paper first begins with a brief introduction to random functional
analysis, including the historical backgrounds for its birth and some important
advances. This paper then further surveys some recent progress in random convex
analysis and its applications to conditional convex risk measures. Finally,
based on these, we establish a concise sufficient and necessary condition for a
return to be a solution to the optimization problem of conditional monotone
mean--variance. We also make use of the recently developed theory of
$L^0$--convex compactness to establish the existence of the optimization
problem of conditional entropic risk measure when the conditional mean of
returns is given and the returns fall within a random closed ball. Besides, the
related uniqueness problems are also solved.

a coding-theoretic framework to guarantee Byzantine-robustness for SignSGD with
Majority Vote, which uses minimum worker-master communication in both

of finding the majority opinion when some workers could be malicious, and paves
the road to implement robust and efficient distributed learning algorithms.
Under this framework, we construct two types of explicit codes, random
Bernoulli codes and deterministic algebraic codes, that can tolerate Byzantine
attacks with a controlled amount of computational redundancy. For the Bernoulli
codes, we provide upper bounds on the error probability in estimating the
majority opinion, which give useful insights into code design for tolerating
Byzantine attacks. As for deterministic codes, we construct an explicit code
which perfectly tolerates Byzantines, and provide tight upper/lower bounds on
the minimum required computational redundancy. Finally, the Byzantine-tolerance
of the suggested coding schemes is confirmed by deep learning experiments on

parameters onto MHD activity and thermal quench (TQ) dynamics is studied and
the influence of MHD onto ablation is shown. TQs are obtained quickly after
injection in most simulations with a typical duration of 100 microseconds,
which slows down at lower resistivity. Although the n=1 magnetic perturbation
dominates in the simulations, toroidal harmonics up to n=10 contribute to
stochastization and stochastic transport in the plasma core. The post-TQ
density profile remains hollow for a few hundred microseconds. However, when
flux surfaces re-form around the magnetic axis, the density has become
monotonic again suggesting a beneficial behaviour for runaway electron
avoidance/mitigation. With $10^{21}$ atoms injected, the TQ is typically
incomplete and triggered when the shards reach the q=2 rational surface. At a
larger number of injected atoms, the TQ can set in even before the shards reach
this surface. For low field side injection considered here, repeated formation
of outward convection cells is observed in the ablation region reducing
material assimilation. Responsible is a sudden rise of pressure in the high
density cloud when the stochastic region expands further releasing heat from
the hot core. After the TQ, strong sheared poloidal rotation is created by
Maxwell stress, which contributes to re-formation of flux surfaces.

ReActNet, a lightweight convolutional neural network that classifies a given

property of the employed representation is that it can handle repetitive
segments of arbitrary number and duration. Furthermore, the proposed training

raises several of the limiting assumptions of existing approaches regarding the

three-pion correlation functions for the evolving granular sources with

agreement with the experimental data in Pb-Pb collisions at

SCM models the country's counterfactual (non-reform or untreated) trajectory as
a weighted average of other countries' outcomes. The method struggles to
quantify uncertainty; eg. it cannot produce confidence intervals. It is also
suspect to overfit. We propose an alternative method, the Bayesian synthetic
control (BSC), which lacks these flaws. Using MCMC sampling, we implement the
method for two previously studied datasets. The proposed method outperforms SCM
in a simple test of predictive accuracy and casts some doubt on significance of
prior findings. The studied reforms are the German reunification of 1990 and
the California tobacco legislation of 1988. BSC borrows its causal model, the
linear latent factor model, from the SCM literature. Unlike SCM, BSC estimates
the latent factors explicitly through a dimensionality reduction. All
uncertainty is captured in the posterior distribution so that, unlike for SCM,
credible intervals are easily derived. Further, BSC's reliability on the target
panel dataset can be assessed through a posterior predictive check; SCM and its
frequentist derivatives use up the required information while testing
statistical significance.

cause a significant reduction in their light emission and energy efficiencies.
Metal nanoparticle (NP) surface coatings have been demonstrated to increase the
light extraction efficiency from planar high refractive index semiconductor
surfaces. This emission enhancement in Au NP-coated ZnO is widely attributed to
involvement of a green (~ 2.5 eV) deep level ZnO defect exciting localized
surface plasmons in the NPs that non-radiatively decay into hot electrons,
which return to ZnO and radiatively recombine. In this work, we achieve a 6
times enhancement of the ultra-violet excitonic emission in ZnO nanorods that
are coated with 5 nm Au NPs without the aid of ZnO defects. Cathodoluminescence
(CL), photoluminescence (PL) and a novel concurrent CL-PL technique as well as
time resolved PL spectroscopy revealed that the increase in UV emission is due
to the formation of an additional fast excitonic relaxation pathway that
increases the exciton spontaneous emission rate. Concurrent CL-PL measurements
ruled out the presence of charge transfer mechanism in the emission enhancement
process. While time resolved PL results confirmed the existence of a new
excitonic recombination channel that is attributed to exciton relaxation via
the plasmon-assisted excitation of rapid non-radiative Au interband
transitions. Our results establish that ZnO defect levels ~ 2.5 eV are not
required to facilitate Au NP induced enhancement of the ZnO UV emission.

meet the stringent delay requirements of URLLC, short packet transmission is
adopted and taken into account for resource allocation algorithm design. The
resource allocation is optimized for maximization of the weighted system sum
throughput subject to quality-of-service (QoS) constraints regarding the URLLC
users' number of transmitted bits, packet error probability, and delay. Despite
the non-convexity of the resulting optimization problem, the optimal solution
is found via monotonic optimization. The corresponding optimal resource
allocation policy can serve as a performance upper bound for sub-optimal
low-complexity solutions. We develop such a low-complexity resource allocation
algorithm to strike a balance between performance and complexity. Our
simulation results reveal the importance of using multiple antennas for
reducing the latency and improving the reliability of URLLC systems. Moreover,
the proposed sub-optimal algorithm is shown to closely approach the performance
of the proposed optimal algorithm and outperforms two baseline schemes by a
considerable margin, especially when the users have heterogeneous delay
requirements. Finally, conventional resource allocation designs based on
Shannon's capacity formula are shown to be not applicable in MISO OFDMA-URLLC

segment of the SSH ring inherits the unidirectional feature and exhibits some
intriguing dynamic behaviors when it is embedded in a Hermitian chain as a
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric scattering center. Based on the Bethe ansatz
scattering solution for the interface between Hermitian and non-Hermitian
regions, we show that the SSH scattering center supports the following
wave-packet dynamics. (i) A left incident wave packet is allowed perfect
transmission, while a right incident wave packet stimulates an amplified
reflecting wave train with the length proportional to the size of the SSH
segment. Accordingly, a unidirectional invisibility of Bragg scatterers is
observed when a multi-SSH segment is considered. (ii) A left incident wave
packet can be well confined in a SSH segment if the right lead is removed.
(iii) In addition, a wave packet is perfectly absorbed when its size closes to
the length of the SSH segment. The underlying mechanism stems from a subtle
property of the SSH segment, which supports two quasicoalescing wave packets
but with opposite group velocities. Our findings are applicable to the schemes
of realizing quantum state storage, quantum diode, and lasing device.

real-world conditions were detectable in the stressful road crossing, but not
in the other types of environments. The article concludes that despite
challenges and limitations of current off-the-shelf wearables, the utilization
of these devices offers novel opportunities for evaluating episodic changes in
physiological signals as a marker for mental state during everyday activities

the sensitivity of the radio channel to blockages, which gives rise to unstable

connectivity is a promising approach for ensuring the desired rate and
reliability requirements. A robust beamformer design is proposed to improve the
communication reliability by exploiting the spatial macro-diversity and a
pessimistic estimate of rates over potential link blockage combinations.
Specifically, we provide a blockage-aware algorithm for the weighted sum-rate
maximization (WSRM) problem with parallel beamformer processing across
distributed remote radio units (RRUs). Combinations of non-convex and coupled
constraints are handled via successive convex approximation (SCA) framework,
which admits a closed-form solution for each SCA step, by solving a system of
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions. Unlike the conventional
coordinated multi-point (CoMP) schemes, the proposed blockage-aware beamformer
design has, per-iteration, computational complexity in the order of RRU
antennas instead of system-wide joint transmit antennas. This leads to a
practical and computationally efficient implementation that is scalable to any
arbitrary multi-point configuration. In the presence of random blockages, the
proposed schemes are shown to significantly outperform baseline scenarios and
result in reliable mmWave communication.

still unresolved. Time-frequency analysis of epicardial electrograms has been
investigated to study atrial fibrillation. However, deeper understanding of
atrial fibrillation can be achieved if the spatial dimension can be
incorporated. Unfortunately, the physical models describing the spatial
relations of atrial fibrillation signals are complex and non-linear; hence, the
conventional signal processing techniques to study electrograms in the joint
space, time, and frequency domain are less suitable. In this study, we wish to
put forward a radically different approach to analyze atrial fibrillation with
a higher-level model. This approach relies on graph signal processing to
represent the spatial relations between epicardial electrograms and put forward
a graph-time spectral analysis for atrial fibrillation. To capture the
frequency content along both the time and graph domain, we proposed the joint
graph and short-time Fourier transform. The latter allows us to analyze the
spatial variability of the electrogram temporal frequencies. With this
technique, we have found that the spatial variation of the atrial electrograms
decreases during atrial fibrillation due to the reduction of the high temporal
frequencies of the atrial waves. The proposed analysis further confirms that
the ventricular activity is smoother over the atrial area compared with the
atrial activity. Besides using the proposed graph-time analysis to conduct a
first study on atrial fibrillation, we applied it to the cancellation of
ventricular activity from atrial electrograms. Experimental results on
simulated and real data further corroborate the findings in this atrial
fibrillation study.

Reynolds stress and POD are taken into consideration to investigate the flow

series of important conclusions have been drawn. For the main flow, the

flow field. The size and number of vortices in the corner area are
significantly reduced, because the increase in Reynolds number makes the influx

the simultaneous optimization of nearly one hundred source and lens parameters

analyzing mock lensing systems with different signal-to-noise ratios, we show

on visible pedestrian regions while suppressing the occluded ones by modulating

the evolution of carbon-polluted white dwarfs (DQs) across a large range of
effective temperatures. These analyses have clearly confirmed the existence of
two distinct DQ evolutionary sequences: one with normal-mass white dwarfs and
one with heavily polluted and generally more massive objects. The first
sequence is thought to result from the dredge-up of carbon from the core, while
the second could at least partially be made of descendants of Hot DQs. However,
the evolution of carbon-polluted white dwarfs below 6500 K remains unexplored,
mainly due to the theoretical difficulties associated with modelling their
dense atmospheres. In this work, we present a detailed star-by-star analysis of
cool carbon-polluted white dwarfs. Our recently improved atmosphere models
allow us to obtain good fits to most objects, including very cool DQpec white
dwarfs with strongly shifted C$_2$ molecular bands. We show that cool
carbon-polluted white dwarfs keep following the two distinct evolutionary
tracks previously identified at higher temperatures. We also find that most DQ
white dwarfs transform into DQpec when their photospheric densities exceed
$\approx$ 0.15 g/cm$^3$. However, we identify stars for which the
DQ$\rightarrow$DQpec transition occurs at lower photospheric densities,
possibly due to the presence of a strong magnetic field.

traditional and learned indexes (such as RMI and FITing-tree). We show that the

more than four orders of magnitude, while achieving their same or even better

the PGM-index. First, we design a compressed PGM-index that further reduces its
space footprint by exploiting the repetitiveness at the level of the learned
linear models it is composed of. Second, we design a PGM-index that adapts
itself to the distribution of the queries, thus resulting in the first known
distribution-aware learned index to date. Finally, given its flexibility in the

For values of the the applied potential difference $V$ that are not very small,
there is a experimentally observed universal regime in which $G \sim V^m$,
where $m$ is a universal exponent. We consider the theoretical prediction of
the values of $m$ by using the method of Effective Field Theory ($EFT$), which
is appropriate for discussing universal phenomena. We describe the Mott
material by the $EFT$ pertaining the long-distance behavior of a spinless
Hubbard-like model with nearest neighbors interactions previously considered.
At the Mott transition, the $EFT$ is known to be given by a double Abelian
Chern-Simons theory. The simplest realization of this theory at the tunneling
interface yields a Conformal Field Theory with central charges $(c,\bar c)
=(1,1)$ and Jain filling fraction $\nu = 2/3$ describing a pair of independent
counter-propagating chiral bosons (one charged and one neutral). Tunneling from
the material into the metal is, therefore, described by this $EFT$ at the Mott
critical point. The resulting tunneling conductance behaves as $G \sim
V^{(1/\nu -1)}$, yielding the prediction $m=1/2$, which compares well (within a

We present a systematic and scalable approach to creating KonIQ-10k, the

the first in-the-wild database aiming for ecological validity, concerning the
authenticity of distortions, the diversity of content, and quality-related

quality ratings from 1,459 crowd workers, paving the way for more general IQA
models. We propose a novel, deep learning model (KonCept512), to show an
excellent generalization beyond the test set (0.921 SROCC), to the current
state-of-the-art database LIVE-in-the-Wild (0.825 SROCC). The model derives its
core performance from the InceptionResNet architecture, being trained at a
higher resolution than previous models (512x384). Correlation analysis shows
that KonCept512 performs similar to having 9 subjective scores for each test

constraining magnetic fields is to measure polarized emission and absorption
produced by magnetically aligned elongated dust grains. The fact that radiation
also becomes linearly polarized by light scattering at optical to millimeter
wavelengths complicates magnetic field studies. We characterize the linear
polarization of mid-infrared radiation due to scattering of the stellar
radiation and dust thermal re-emission radiation (self-scattering). We find
that the thermal re-emission radiation is stronger than the scattered stellar
radiation for disks with inner holes smaller than 10 au within the considered
parameter range. The mid-infrared polarization due to scattering shows several
clear trends: For scattered stellar radiation only, the linear polarization
degree decreases slightly with increasing radial distance, while it increases
with radial distance for thermal re-emission radiation only and for a
combination of scattered stellar radiation and thermal re-emission radiation.
The linear polarization degree decreases with increasing disk flaring and
luminosity of the central star. An increasing inner radius shifts the increase
of the linear polarization degree further outside, while a larger scale height
increases the linear polarization degree for small radial distances and
decreases this degree further outside. For longer wavelengths, the linear
polarization degree converges more slowly.

its high cost still remains a barrier to wider usage, especially by researchers

variations related to space weather phenomena and may be an important tool to
study them. The cosmic ray intensity recorded with ground-based detectors also
shows temporal variations arising from atmospheric variations. In the case of
muon detectors, the main atmospheric effects are related to pressure and
temperature changes. In this work, we analyze both effects using data recorded
by the Global Muon Detector Network (GMDN), consisting of four multidirectional
muon detectors at different locations, in the period between 2007 and 2016. For
each GMDN directional channel, we obtain coefficients that describe the
pressure and temperature effects. We then analyze how these coefficients can be
related to the geomagnetic cutoff rigidity and zenith angle associated with
cosmic-ray particles observed by each channel. In the pressure effect analysis,
we found that the observed barometric coefficients show a very clear
logarithmic correlation with the cutoff rigidity divided by the zenith angle
cosine. On the other hand, the temperature coefficients show a good logarithmic
correlation with the product of the cutoff and zenith angle cosine after adding
a term proportional to the sine of geographical latitude of the observation
site. This additional term implies that the temperature effect measured in the
northern hemisphere detectors is stronger than that observed in the southern
hemisphere. The physical origin of this term and of the good correlations found
in this analysis should be studied in detail in future works.

by Mirzaei et al. in the recent paper ""AndrODet: An adaptive Android

using samples from the AMD and PraGuard malware datasets. However, the authors
failed to account for the fact that many of the AMD samples are highly similar
due to the fact that they come from the same malware family. This introduces a
risk that a machine learning system trained on these samples could fail to
learn a generalizable model for string encryption detection, and might instead
learn to classify samples based on characteristics of each malware family. Our
own evaluation strongly indicates that the reported high accuracy of AndrODet's
string encryption detection is indeed due to this phenomenon. When we evaluated
AndrODet, we found that when we ensured that samples from the same family never
appeared in both training and testing data, the accuracy dropped to around 50%.
Moreover, the PraGuard dataset is not suitable for evaluating a static string
encryption detector such as AndrODet, since the particular obfuscation tool
used to produce the dataset effectively makes it impossible to extract
meaningful features of static strings in Android apps.

length is exceptionally long. Here, we study these regimes by performing
quantum simulations of graphene nonlocal spin valves. We find that conventional

The implementation includes ultrasoft pseudopotentials and is valid for both

DFPT combined with the low-cost DFT+$U$ functional. This allows to avoid
computationally intensive frozen-phonon calculations when DFT+$U$ is used to
eliminate the residual electronic self-interaction from approximate functionals
and to capture the localization of valence electrons e.g. on $d$ or $f$ states.
In this way, the effects of electronic localization (possibly due to
correlations) are consistently taken into account in the calculation of
specific phonon modes, Born effective charges, dielectric tensors and in
quantities requiring well converged sums over many phonon frequencies, as
phonon density of states and free energies. The new computational tool is
applied to two representative systems, namely CoO, a prototypical transition

ground state solution of a degenerate parabolic equation of the form
\begin{equation*}
u_t(t,x)+(x^{\alpha}u_x(t,x))_x+p(t)x^{2-\alpha}u(t,x)=0,\qquad
t\geq0,x\in(0,1) \end{equation*} via bilinear control $p\in
L_{loc}^2(0,+\infty)$. More precisely, we provide a control function $p$ that
steers the solution of the equation, $u$, to the ground state solution in small
time with doubly-exponential rate of convergence.\\ The parameter $\alpha$
describes the degeneracy magnitude. In particular, for $\alpha\in[0,1)$ the
problem is called weakly degenerate, while for $\alpha\in[1,2)$ strong
degeneracy occurs. We are able to prove the aforementioned stabilization
property for $\alpha\in [0,3/2)$. The proof relies on the application of an
abstract result on rapid stabilizability of parabolic evolution equations by
the action of bilinear control. A crucial role is also played by Bessel's
functions.

provided that such a structure is locally equivalent to its model $\mathbf{X}$,
the main question treated here is the completeness of the associated

spaces of projective geometry and non-Lorentzian conformal geometry, a number
of arguments apply in both contexts. We therefore present the proofs in

the manifold is globally equivalent to either the model space $\mathbf{X}$ or

machine translation (MT) research. Traditional automatic reference-based
metrics, such as BLEU, have shown correlations with human judgements of
adequacy and fluency and have been paramount for the advancement of MT system
development. Crowd-sourcing has popularised and enabled the scalability of
metrics based on human judgements, such as subjective direct assessments (DA)
of adequacy, that are believed to be more reliable than reference-based
automatic metrics. Finally, task-based measurements, such as post-editing time,
are expected to provide a more detailed evaluation of the usefulness of
translations for a specific task. Therefore, while DA averages adequacy
judgements to obtain an appraisal of (perceived) quality independently of the
task, and reference-based automatic metrics try to objectively estimate quality
also in a task-independent way, task-based metrics are measurements obtained
either during or after performing a specific task. In this paper we argue that,
although expensive, task-based measurements are the most reliable when
estimating MT quality in a specific task; in our case, this task is
post-editing. To that end, we report experiments on a dataset with
newly-collected post-editing indicators and show their usefulness when
estimating post-editing effort. Our results show that task-based metrics
comparing machine-translated and post-edited versions are the best at tracking
post-editing effort, as expected. These metrics are followed by DA, and then by
metrics comparing the machine-translated version and independent references. We
suggest that MT practitioners should be aware of these differences and
acknowledge their implications when deciding how to evaluate MT for
post-editing purposes.

Conducting the experiment on a large number of the YBCO samples being hydrated
at different distances from the disk clearly indicates a significant inhibitory
effect of this factor. We find that there is a certain distance from the
surface of the metal body, at which the hydration process achieves maximum
sensitivity to the metal presence. At this stage of research, it is assumed
that the mediator, with the aid of which the influence on the hydration process
occurs, might be electromagnetic radiation emanating from the YBCO samples
during their hydration and reflected from the surface of metal.

of chemical reaction systems and the convective field derived from the chemical
Fokker-Planck equation (CFPE) by comparing predictions of the convective field
to the results of stochastic simulations based on Gillespie's algorithm. The
convective field takes into account the drift term of the CFPE and the reaction
bias introduced by the diffusion term. For one-dimensional systems, fixed
points and bifurcations of the convective field correspond to extrema and
phenomenological bifurcations of the stationary probability distribution
whenever the CFPE is a good approximation to the stochastic dynamics. This
provides an efficient way to calculate the effect of system size on the number
and location of probability maxima and their phenomenological bifurcations in
parameter space. For two-dimensional systems, we study models that have
saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations in the macroscopic limit. Here, the existence
of two stable fixed points of the convective field correlates either with two
peaks of the stationary probability distribution, or with a peak and a
shoulder. In contrast, a Hopf bifurcation that occurs in the convective field
for decreasing system size is not accompanied by the onset of a crater-shaped
probability distribution; decreasing system size rather destroys craters and
replaces them by local maxima.

for achieving spectrum and energy efficient wireless networks. By leveraging
massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect radio-frequency (RF)
signals with adjustable phase shifts, IRS can achieve high passive beamforming
gains, which are particularly appealing for improving the efficiency of
RF-based wireless power transfer. Motivated by the above, we study in the paper
an IRS-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)
system. Specifically, a set of IRSs are deployed to assist in the
information/power transfer from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple
single-antenna information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs), respectively. We
aim to minimize the transmit power at the AP via jointly optimizing its
transmit precoders and the reflect phase shifts at all IRSs, subject to the
quality-of-service (QoS) constraints at all users, namely, the individual
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at IUs and energy
harvesting constraints at EUs. However, this optimization problem is non-convex
with intricately coupled variables, for which the existing alternating
optimization approach is shown to be inefficient as the number of QoS
constraints increases. To tackle this challenge, we first apply proper
transformations on the QoS constraints and then propose an efficient iterative
algorithm by applying the penalty-based method. Moreover, by exploiting the
short-range coverage of IRSs, we further propose a low-complexity algorithm by
optimizing the phase shifts of all IRSs in parallel.

nonparametric regression (NR) incurs high bias when the training size is

systematically integrates the residuals of NR with KMM reweighting, based on a

strictly outperform or match the best-known existing rates for both KMM and NR,
and thus is a robust combination of both estimators. The experiments shows the

on top of message-passing models. The main hurdle with such emulations is
dealing with server faults in the system. Several crash-tolerant register
emulations in static systems require algorithms to replicate the value of the
shared register onto a majority of servers. Majority correctness is necessary
for such emulations. Byzantine faults are considered to be the worst kind of
faults that can happen in any distributed system. Emulating a
Byzantine-tolerant register requires replicating the register value on to more
than two-thirds of the servers. Emulating a register in a dynamic system where
servers and clients can enter and leave the system and be faulty is harder than
in static systems. There are several crash-tolerant register emulations for
dynamic systems. This paper presents the first emulation of a multi-reader
multi-writer atomic register in a system that can withstand nodes continually
entering and leaving, imposes no upper bound on the system size and can
tolerate Byzantine servers. The algorithm works as long as the number of
servers entering and leaving during a fixed time interval is at most a constant
fraction of the system size at the beginning of the interval, and as long as
the number of Byzantine servers in the system is at most f. Although our
algorithm requires that there be a constant known upper bound on the number of
Byzantine servers, this restriction is unavoidable, as we show that it is
impossible to emulate an atomic register if the system size and maximum number
of servers that can be Byzantine in the system is unknown to the nodes.

the sky background, which comes from moonlight, bright star, and city lighting
pollution. During CCD reduction, the effect of background uniformity cannot be

  Images for Osteoporosis Screening",,,,,"physics.med-ph eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: The purpose is to design a novelty automatic diagnostic method for
osteoporosis screening by using the potential capability of convolutional
neural network (CNN) in feature representation and extraction, which can be
incorporated into the procedure of routine CT diagnostic in physical
examination thereby improving the osteoporosis diagnosis and reducing the
patient burden. Methods: The proposed convolutional neural network-based method
mainly comprises two functional modules to perform automatic detection of bone
condition by analyzing the diagnostic CT image. The first functional module
aims to locate and segment the ROI of diagnostic CT image, called
Mark-Segmentation-Network (MS-Net). The second functional module is used to
determine the category of bone condition by the features of ROI, called
Bone-Conditions-Classification-Network (BCC-Net). The trained MS-Net can get
the mark image of inputted original CT image, thereby obtain the segmentation
image. The trained BCC-Net can obtain the probability value of normal bone
mass, low bone mass, and osteoporosis by inputting the segmentation image. On
the basis of network results, the radiologists can provide preliminary
qualitative diagnosis results of bone condition. Results: The proposed MS-Net
has an excellent segmentation precision on the shape preservation of different
lumbar vertebra. The numerical indicators of segmentation results are greater
than 0.998. The proposed BCC-Net was evaluated with 3,024 clinical images and
achieved an accuracy of 76.65% and an area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve of 0.9167. Conclusions: This study proposed a novel
two-step method for automatic detection of bone conditions via diagnostic CT
images and it has great potential in clinical applications for osteoporosis
screening. The method can potentially reduce the manual burden to radiologists
and diagnostic cost to patients.

changes on other parts of the road network. Our experimental results show that
CLLA can reduce the average travel time significantly in congested road

against those attacks. In this work, we explore vulnerabilities of DNN models
under the umbrella of Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, which has not been
investigated before. From the perspective of an MitM adversary, the
aforementioned adversarial example attacks are not viable anymore. First, such
attacks must acquire the outputs from the models by multiple times before
actually launching attacks, which is difficult for the MitM adversary in
practice. Second, such attacks are one-off and cannot be directly generalised
onto new data examples, which decreases the rate of return for the attacker. In
contrast, using generative models to craft adversarial examples on the fly can
mitigate the drawbacks. However, the adversarial capability of the generative
models, such as Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), has not been extensively
studied. Therefore, given a classifier, we investigate using a VAE decoder to
either transform benign inputs to their adversarial counterparts or decode
outputs from benign VAE encoders to be adversarial examples. The proposed
method can endue more capability to MitM attackers. Based on our evaluation,
the proposed attack can achieve above 95% success rate on both MNIST and

bitwidth for activation outliers by overwriting nearby zeros. It has two major

reallocates bits to increase the range of outliers, while precision overwrite
reuses zeros to increase the precision of non-outlier values. Combining range
overwrite with a simple cascading logic, we handle the vast majority of
outliers to significantly improve model accuracy at low bitwidth. Our

field theories (e.g. of classical (Newtonian) mechanics, hydrodynamics,
electrodynamics, relativity theory, classical Yang-Mills theory and so on) that
are described by such equations. Employing a geometric (jet space) approach, a
suitable notion of shared structure of two systems of PDEs is identified. It is
proven that this shared structure can serve to transfer solutions from one
theory to another and a generalization of so-called B\""acklund transformations
is derived that can be used to generate non-trivial solutions of some
non-linear PDEs. A procedure (based on formal integrability) is introduced with
which one can explicitly compute the minimal consistency conditions that two
systems of PDEs need to fulfill in order to share structure under a given
correspondence. Furthermore, it is shown how symmetry groups can be used to
identify useful correspondences and structure that is shared up to symmetries.
Thereby, the role that B\""acklund transformations play in the theory of
quotient equations is clarified. Explicit examples illustrate the general ideas
throughout the text and in the last chapter, the framework is applied to

immersed boundary (overset-CURVIB) method to enable tackling a wide range of
challenging flow problems. The dynamic overset grids are used to locally
increase the grid resolution near complex immersed bodies, which are handled
using a sharp interface immersed boundary method, undergoing large movements as
well as arbitrary relative motions. The new framework extends the previous
overset-CURVIB method with fixed overset grids and a sequential grid assembly
to moving overset grids with an efficient parallel grid assembly. In addition,
a new method for the interpolation of variables at the grid boundaries is
developed which can drastically decrease the execution time and increase the
parallel efficiency of our framework compared to the previous strategy. The
moving/rotating overset grids are solved in a non-inertial frame of reference
to avoid recalculating the curvilinear metrics of transformation while the
background/stationary grids are solved in the inertial frame. The new framework
is verified and validated against experimental data, and analytical/benchmark
solutions. In addition, the results of the overset grid are compared with
results over a similar single grid. The method is shown to be 2nd order
accurate, decrease the computational cost relative to a single grid, and good
overall parallel speedup. The grid assembly takes less than 7% of the total CPU
time even at the highest number of CPUs tested in this work. The capabilities
of our method are demonstrated by simulating the flow past a school of
self-propelled aquatic swimmers arranged initially in a diamond pattern.

complementary time period and relate it with the classical time period through
integral powers of the imaginary unit to formulate the notions of unobservable
velocity and acceleration, which are perpendicular and tangential to the
holographic sphere, respectively, and bound with the observable velocity and
acceleration based on Pythagorean relations. We further discuss certain

about reliability, repeatability, trust, and maintainability of AI applications
remain. As AI becomes pervasive despite its shortcomings, more systematic ways
of approaching AI software development and certification are needed. These
fundamental aspects establish the need for a discipline on ""AI Engineering"".
This paper presents the current perspective of relevant AI engineering concepts
and some key challenges that need to be overcome to make significant progress
in this important area.

  Predicting Post-System Performance","8 pages, accepted to the International Conference on Computers in
  Education",,,,"cs.CY cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent student knowledge modeling algorithms such as Deep Knowledge Tracing
(DKT) and Dynamic Key-Value Memory Networks (DKVMN) have been shown to produce
accurate predictions of problem correctness within the same learning system.
However, these algorithms do not attempt to directly infer student knowledge.
In this paper we present an extension to these algorithms to also infer
knowledge. We apply this extension to DKT and DKVMN, resulting in knowledge
estimates that correlate better with a posttest than knowledge estimates from
Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT), an algorithm designed to infer knowledge, and
another classic algorithm, Performance Factors Analysis (PFA). We also apply
our extension to correctness predictions from BKT and PFA, finding that
knowledge estimates produced with it correlate better with the posttest than
BKT and PFA's standard knowledge estimates. These findings are significant
since the primary aim of education is to prepare students for later experiences
outside of the immediate learning activity.

awareness of user preferences (e.g., costs, times) and trip characteristics
(e.g., purpose, distance). The work was based on real-life trips obtained from
a map application. Several methods including gradient boosting tree, learning
to rank, multinomial logit model, automated machine learning, random forest,
and shallow neural network have been tried. For some methods, feature selection
and over-sampling techniques were also tried. The results show that the best
performing method is a gradient boosting tree model with synthetic minority
over-sampling technique (SMOTE). Also, results of the multinomial logit model
show that (1) an increase in travel cost would decrease the utility of all the
transportation modes; (2) people are less sensitive to the travel distance for
the metro mode or a multi-modal option that containing metro, i.e., compared to
other modes, people would be more willing to tolerate long-distance metro
trips. This indicates that metro lines might be a good candidate for large
cities.

Using phase-sensitive dual comb design, the comb lines are gradually swept over

applying a current modulation. We show that with interleaving the spectral
point spacing is reduced by more than four orders of magnitude over the full

fuzzy inference system for diagnosing disorders is presented in this paper. The
main contributions of the novel proposed method can be a global search across
the whole search space with faster convergence rate. Moreover, it shows a
better exploration and exploitation by applying the adaptive control
parameters, automatic control of inertia weight and coefficient of personal and
social behaviours. Utilizing such attributes lead to a fast and smart diagnosis
mechanism which is able to diagnosis the diseases by the high accuracy. The
ANPSO is associated with tuning the characteristics of the inference system to
achieve the minimum diagnosis error as far as the optimized model is obtained.
As a case study, we use liver disorders dataset called Bupa. According to the
preliminary ramifications, the suggested adaptive PSO performance can overcome
the traditional inference system and combined with other optimization methods
substantially.

Kriege, Christopher Morris, Petra Mutzel","Temporal Graph Kernels for Classifying Dissemination Processes",,,,,"cs.SI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many real-world graphs or networks are temporal, e.g., in a social network
persons only interact at specific points in time. This information directs
dissemination processes on the network, such as the spread of rumors, fake
news, or diseases. However, the current state-of-the-art methods for supervised
graph classification are designed mainly for static graphs and may not be able
to capture temporal information. Hence, they are not powerful enough to
distinguish between graphs modeling different dissemination processes. To
address this, we introduce a framework to lift standard graph kernels to the
temporal domain. Specifically, we explore three different approaches and
investigate the trade-offs between loss of temporal information and efficiency.
Moreover, to handle large-scale graphs, we propose stochastic variants of our
kernels with provable approximation guarantees. We evaluate our methods on a
wide range of real-world social networks. Our methods beat static kernels by a
large margin in terms of accuracy while still being scalable to large graphs
and data sets. Hence, we confirm that taking temporal information into account
is crucial for the successful classification of dissemination processes.

  Media",,,,,"cs.SI stat.AP stat.CO stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A growing number of empirical studies suggest that negative advertising is
effective in campaigning, while the mechanisms are rarely mentioned. With the
scandal of Cambridge Analytica and Russian intervention behind the Brexit and
the 2016 presidential election, people have become aware of the political ads
on social media and have pressured congress to restrict political advertising
on social media. Following the related legislation, social media companies
began disclosing their political ads archive for transparency during the summer
of 2018 when the midterm election campaign was just beginning. This research
collects the data of the related political ads in the context of the U.S.
midterm elections since August to study the overall pattern of political ads on
social media and uses sets of machine learning methods to conduct sentiment
analysis on these ads to classify the negative ads. A novel approach is applied
that uses AI image recognition to study the image data. Through data
visualization, this research shows that negative advertising is still the
minority, Republican advertisers and third party organizations are more likely
to engage in negative advertising than their counterparts. Based on ordinal
regressions, this study finds that anger evoked information-seeking is one of
the main mechanisms causing negative ads to be more engaging and effective
rather than the negative bias theory. Overall, this study provides a unique
understanding of political advertising on social media by applying innovative
data science methods. Further studies can extend the findings, methods, and
datasets in this study, and several suggestions are given for future research.
