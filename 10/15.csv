been achieved in strained MnAs nanocrystals embedded in a wurtzite GaAs matrix.
Wurtzite GaAs exerts tensile stress on hexagonal MnAs nanocrystals, preventing
a hexagonal to orthorhombic structural phase transition, which in the bulk MnAs
is combined with the magnetic one. This effect results in a remarkable shift of
the magneto-structural phase transition temperature from 313 K in the bulk MnAs
to above 400 K in the tensely strained MnAs nanocrystals. This finding is
corroborated by the state of the art transmission electron microscopy,
sensitive magnetometry and the first-principles calculations. The effect relies
in defining a nanotube geometry of molecular beam epitaxy grown core-multishell
wurtzite (Ga,In)As/(Ga,Al)As/(Ga,Mn)As/GaAs nanowires where the MnAs
nanocrystals are formed during the thermal-treatment-induced phase separation
of wurtzite (Ga,Mn)As into the GaAs:MnAs granular system. Such a unique
combination of two types of hexagonal lattices provides possibility of
attaining quasi-hydrostatic tensile strain in MnAs (impossible otherwise),
leading to the substantial ferromagnetic phase transition temperature increase
in this compound.

interatomic autoionization process traditionally termed 'Penning ionization'
when the host cluster is resonantly excited. Here we analyze this process in
the light of the interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD) mechanism, which usually
contains a contribution from charge exchange at short interatomic distance, and
one from virtual photon transfer at large interatomic distance. For helium (He)
nanodroplets doped with alkali metal atoms (Li, Rb), we show that long-range
and short-range contributions to the interatomic autoionization can be clearly
distinguished by detecting electrons and ions in coincidence. Surprisingly, ab
initio calculations show that even for alkali metal atoms floating in dimples
at large distance from the nanodroplet surface, autoionization is largely
dominated by charge exchange ICD. Furthermore, the measured electron spectra
manifest ultrafast internal relaxation of the droplet into mainly the 1s2s 1^S

calorimeter operating at the CERN LHC. It is responsible for the identification
and precise reconstruction of electrons and photons in CMS, which were crucial
in the discovery and subsequent characterization of the Higgs boson. It also
contributes to the reconstruction of tau leptons, jets, and calorimeter energy
sums, which are vital components of many CMS physics analyses. The ECAL trigger
system employs fast digital signal processing algorithms to precisely measure
the energy and timing information of ECAL energy deposits recorded during LHC
collisions. These trigger primitives are transmitted to the Level-1 trigger
system at the LHC collisions rate of 40 MHz. These energy deposits are then
combined with information from other CMS sub-detectors to determine whether the
event should trigger the readout of the data from CMS to permanent storage.
This presentation will summarize the ECAL trigger performance achieved during
LHC Run 2 (2015-2018). It will describe the methods that are used to provide
frequent calibrations of the ECAL trigger primitives during LHC operation.
These are needed to account for radiation-induced changes in crystal and
photodetector response, and to minimize the spurious triggering on direct
signals in the photodetectors used in the barrel region ($\eta<$1.48). Both of
these effects are increased relative to LHC Run 1 (2009-2012), due to the
higher luminosities experienced in Run 2. Further improvements in the energy
and time reconstruction of the CMS ECAL trigger primitives are being explored
for LHC Run 3 (2021-23). The main features of these improved algorithms will be
described and preliminary estimates of the potential performance gains will be
given.

to constrain the energy scale of inflation. The conclusions however depend on
the assumptions about post-inflationary history of the Universe. E.g. in the
standard case of a thermal post-inflationary history in which the Universe
stays radiation dominated at all times from the end of inflation to the epoch
of radiation matter equality, TCC has been used to argue that the Hubble
parameter during inflation, $H_{\inf}$, is below ${\cal O}(0.1) ~{\rm GeV}$.
Cosmological scenarios with a non-thermal post-inflationary history are
well-motivated alternatives to the standard picture and it is interesting to
find out the possible constraints which TCC imposes on such scenarios. In this
work, we find out the amount of enhancement of the TCC compatible bound on
$H_{\inf}$ if post-inflationary history before nucleosynthesis was non-thermal.
We then argue that if TCC is correct, for a large class of scenarios, it is not
possible for the Universe to have undergone a phase of moduli domination.

across the Hubble sequence, using integral-field spectroscopic data from the
CALIFA survey. Adopting the same $\lambda_\mathrm{R}$ parameter previously used
to distinguish between slow and fast rotating early-type (elliptical and
lenticular) galaxies, we show that spiral galaxies as expected are almost all
fast rotators. Given the extent of our data, we provide relations for
$\lambda_\mathrm{R}$ measured in different apertures, including conversions to
long-slit 1D apertures. Our sample displays a wide range of
$\lambda_\mathrm{Re}$ values, consistent with previous IFS studies. The fastest
rotators are dominated by relatively massive and highly star-forming Sb
galaxies, which preferentially reside in the main star-forming sequence. These
galaxies reach $\lambda_\mathrm{Re}$ values of $\sim$0.85, are the largest
galaxies at a given mass, and display some of the strongest stellar population
gradients. Compared to the population of S0 galaxies, our findings suggest that
fading may not be the dominant mechanism transforming spirals into lenticulars.
Interestingly, we find that $\lambda_\mathrm{Re}$ decreases for late-type Sc
and Sd spiral galaxies, with values than in occasions puts them in the
slow-rotator regime. While for some of them this can be explained by their
irregular morphologies and/or face-on configurations, others are edge-on
systems with no signs of significant dust obscuration. The latter are typically
at the low-mass end, but this does not explain their location in the classical
($V/\sigma$,$\varepsilon$) and ($\lambda_\mathrm{Re}$,$\varepsilon$) diagrams.
Our initial investigations, based on dynamical models, suggest that these are
dynamically hot disks, probably influenced by the observed important fraction
of dark matter within R$_\mathrm{e}$.

  There mainly exist three ways to represent 3D frames: combination of

  We propose here a representation carried out by the special unitary group.
  The article strongly relies on \cite{du1964homographies}.
  We first describe the rotations with quaternions, \cite[\S
13-15]{du1964homographies}.
  We define and show the isomorphism between unit quaternions and the special
unitary group, \cite[\S 16]{du1964homographies}.
  The frame field space is identified as the quotient group of rotations by the
octahedral group, \cite[\S 20]{du1964homographies}.
  The invariant forms of the vierer, tetrahedral and octahedral groups are
successively built, without using homographies \cite[\S
39]{du1964homographies}.
  Modifying the definition of the isomorphism between unit quaternions and the
special unitary group allows to use the invariant forms of the octahedral group
as a unique parameterization of the orientation of 3D frames.
  The parameterization consists in three complex values, corresponding to a
coordinate of a variety which is embedded in a three complex valued dimensional
space.
  The underlined variety is the model surface of the octahedral group, which
can be expressed with an implicit equation.
  We prove that from a coordinate of the surface, we may identify all the
quaternions giving the corresponding 3D frames.
  We show that the euclidean distance between two coordinates does not
correspond to the actual distance of the corresponding 3D frames.
  We derive the expression of three components of a coordinate in the case of
frames sharing an even direction.
  We then derive a way to ensure that a coordinate corresponds to the special
unitary group.
  Finally, the attempted numerical schemes to compute frame fields are given.

quantum computing. In quantum simulation, a complicated Hamiltonian describing
the dynamics of a quantum system is decomposed into its constituent terms,
where the effect of each term during time-evolution is individually computed.
For many physical systems, the Hamiltonian has a large number of terms,
constraining the scalability of established simulation methods. To address this
limitation we introduce a new scheme that approximates the actual Hamiltonian
with a sparser Hamiltonian containing fewer terms. By stochastically
sparsifying weaker Hamiltonian terms, we benefit from a quadratic suppression
of errors relative to deterministic approaches. Relying on optimality
conditions from convex optimisation theory, we derive an appropriate
probability distribution for the weaker Hamiltonian terms, and compare its
error bounds with other probability ansatzes for some electronic structure
Hamiltonians. Tuning the sparsity of our approximate Hamiltonians allows our
scheme to interpolate between two recent random compilers: qDRIFT and
randomized first order Trotter. Our scheme is thus an algorithm that combines
the strengths of randomised Trotterisation with the efficiency of qDRIFT, and
for intermediate gate budgets, outperforms both of these prior methods.

unusually low Stromgren c1 photometric indices. I show that CDRGs, lacking CH
absorption, exhibit an ""anti-Bond-Neff effect"": higher c1 indices than normal
red giants. Using precise parallaxes from Gaia DR2, I plot CDRGs in the
color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and compare them with theoretical evolution
tracks. Most CDRGs lie in a fairly tight clump in the CMD, indicating initial
masses in the range ~2 to 3.5 Msun, if they have evolved as single stars. It is
unclear whether they are stars that have just reached the base of the red-giant
branch and the first dredge-up of CN-processed material, or are more highly
evolved helium-burning stars in the red-giant clump. About 10% of CDRGs have
higher masses of ~4 to 4.5 Msun, and exhibit unusually high rotational
velocities. I show that CDRGs lie at systematically larger distances from the
Galactic plane than normal giants, possibly indicating a role of binary
mass-transfer and mergers. CDRGs continue to present a major puzzle for our
understanding of stellar evolution.

robustness generalizes beyond the threat model employed during training. CCAT,
trained only on $L_\infty$ adversarial examples, increases robustness against
larger $L_\infty$, $L_2$, $L_1$ and $L_0$ attacks, adversarial frames, distal
adversarial examples and corrupted examples and yields better clean accuracy
compared to adversarial training. For thorough evaluation we developed novel
white- and black-box attacks directly attacking CCAT by maximizing confidence.
For each threat model, we use $7$ attacks with up to $50$ restarts and $5000$

epoch can modify the standard recombination history and therefore the CMB
anisotropy power spectrum. Previous studies have put strong constraints on the
amount of electromagnetic energy injection around the recombination era
(redshifts $z\lesssim 4500$). However, energy injected in the form of energetic
($>$ keV) visible standard model particles is not deposited instantaneously.
The considerable delay between the time of energy injection and the time when
all energy is deposited to background baryonic gas and CMB photons, together
with the extraordinary precision with which the CMB anisotropies have been
measured, means that CMB anisotropies are sensitive to energy that was injected
much before the epoch of recombination. We show that the CMB anisotropy power
spectrum is sensitive to energy injection even at $z = 10000$, giving stronger
constraints compared to big bang nucleosynthesis and CMB spectral distortions.
We derive, using Planck CMB data, the constraints on long-lived unstable
particles decaying at redshifts $z\lesssim 10000$ (lifetime $\tau_X\gtrsim
10^{11}$s) by explicitly evolving the electromagnetic cascades in the expanding
Universe, thus extending previous constraints to lower particle lifetimes. We
also revisit the BBN constraints and show that the delayed injection of energy
is important for BBN constraints. We find that the constraints can be weaker by
a factor of few to almost an order of magnitude, depending on the energy, when
we relax the quasi-static or on-the-spot assumptions.

constraints on the astrophysical properties of sources that drive this signal.
However, extracting astrophysical information from the data is highly
non-trivial and requires the rapid generation of theoretical templates over a
wide range of astrophysical parameters. To this end emulators are often
employed, with previous efforts focused on predicting the power spectrum. In
this work we introduce 21cmGEM - the first emulator of the global 21-cm signal
from Cosmic Dawn and the EoR. The smoothness of the output signal is guaranteed
by design. We train neural networks to predict the cosmological signal using a

astrophysical parameters: the star formation efficiency and the minimal mass of
star-forming halos; the efficiency of the first X-ray sources and their
spectrum parameterized by spectral index and the low energy cutoff; the mean
free path of ionizing photons and the CMB optical depth. We test the
performance with a set of ~2,000 simulated signals, showing that the relative
error in the prediction has an r.m.s. of 0.0159. The algorithm is efficient,
with a running time per parameter set of 0.16 sec. Finally, we use the database

Experimentally, a microscopic anti-correlation behavior between these signals

measurements in a third channel would provide useful information about the
microscopic anti-correlation phenomenon. Work is currently underway at Drexel
University to develop solid argon and xenon bolometers, which would be able to

efforts are aimed at developing a method for growing small noble solid samples

for integrating detector components to measure ionization and scintillation
signals. This will allow for improved characterization of noble solids as

  Approach",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Malicious websites are responsible for a majority of the cyber-attacks and
scams today. Malicious URLs are delivered to unsuspecting users via email, text
messages, pop-ups or advertisements. Clicking on or crawling such URLs can
result in compromised email accounts, launching of phishing campaigns, download
of malware, spyware and ransomware, as well as severe monetary losses. A
machine learning based ensemble classification approach is proposed to detect
malicious URLs in emails, which can be extended to other methods of delivery of
malicious URLs. The approach uses static lexical features extracted from the
URL string, with the assumption that these features are notably different for
malicious and benign URLs. The use of such static features is safer and faster
since it does not involve crawling the URLs or blacklist lookups which tend to
introduce a significant amount of latency in producing verdicts. The goal of
the classification was to achieve high sensitivity i.e. detect as many
malicious URLs as possible. URL strings tend to be very unstructured and noisy.
Hence, bagging algorithms were found to be a good fit for the task since they
average out multiple learners trained on different parts of the training data,
thus reducing variance. The classification model was tested on five different
testing sets and produced an average False Negative Rate (FNR) of 0.1%, average
accuracy of 92% and average AUC of 0.98. The model is presently being used in
the FireEye Advanced URL Detection Engine (used to detect malicious URLs in
emails), to generate fast real-time verdicts on URLs. The malicious URL
detections from the engine have gone up by 22% since the deployment of the
model into the engine workflow. The results obtained show noteworthy evidence
that a purely lexical approach can be used to detect malicious URLs.

that the process of decoding the predicted heatmaps into the final joint
coordinates in the original image space is surprisingly significant for human
pose estimation performance, which nevertheless was not recognised before. In
light of the discovered importance, we further probe the design limitations of
the standard coordinate decoding method widely used by existing methods, and
propose a more principled distribution-aware decoding method. Meanwhile, we
improve the standard coordinate encoding process (i.e. transforming
ground-truth coordinates to heatmaps) by generating accurate heatmap
distributions for unbiased model training. Taking the two together, we
formulate a novel Distribution-Aware coordinate Representation of Keypoint
(DARK) method. Serving as a model-agnostic plug-in, DARK significantly improves
the performance of a variety of state-of-the-art human pose estimation models.
Extensive experiments show that DARK yields the best results on two common

`restarting' the dynamics; at least one approximate time step is taken on the

to produce a state that well approximates the time-stepped results. The
simulation is then restarted from the optimized state. By encoding knowledge of
the form of the solution in the ansatz, such as ensuring that the ansatz has

to become tidally locked in a 1:1 spin:orbit configuration and are prime
targets for future characterization efforts. An issue of importance for the
potential habitability of terrestrial planets is whether they could experience
snowball events (periods of global glaciation). Previous work using an
intermediate complexity atmospheric Global Climate Model (GCM) with no ocean
heat transport suggested that tidally locked planets would smoothly transition
to a snowball, in contrast with Earth, which has bifurcations and hysteresis in
climate state associated with global glaciation. In this paper, we use a
coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM (ROCKE-3D) to model tidally locked planets with no
continents. We chose this configuration in order to consider a case that we
expect to have high ocean heat transport. We show that including ocean heat
transport does not reintroduce the snowball bifurcation. An implication of this
result is that a tidally locked planet in the habitable zone is unlikely to be
found in a snowball state for a geologically significant period of time.

  Case",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Network function virtualization (NFV) is an emerging design paradigm that
replaces physical middlebox devices with software modules running on general
purpose commodity servers. While gradually transitioning to NFV, Internet
service providers face the problem of where to introduce NFV in order to make
the most benefit of that; here, we measure the benefit by the amount of traffic
that can be served in an NFV-enabled network. This problem is non-trivial as it
is composed of two challenging subproblems: 1) placement of nodes to support
virtual network functions (referred to as VNF-nodes); 2) allocation of the
VNF-nodes' resources to network flows. This problem has been studied for the
one-dimensional setting, where all network flows require one network function,
which requires a unit of resource to process a unit of flow. In this work, we
consider the multi-dimensional setting, where flows must be processed by
multiple network functions, which require a different amount of each resource
to process a unit of flow. The multi-dimensional setting introduces new
challenges in addition to those of the one-dimensional setting (e.g.,
NP-hardness and non-submodularity) and also makes the resource allocation
subproblem a multi-dimensional generalization of the generalized assignment
problem with assignment restrictions. To address these difficulties, we propose
a novel two-level relaxation method that allows us to draw a connection to the
sequence submodular theory and utilize the property of sequence submodularity
along with the primal-dual technique to design two approximation algorithms. We
further prove that the proposed algorithms have a non-trivial approximation
ratio that depends on the number of VNF-nodes, resources, and a measure of the
available resource compared to flow demand. Finally, we perform trace-driven
simulations to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

a unique and diverse multi-ethnic dataset of OCT scans consisting of glaucoma
and non-glaucomatous cases obtained from four tertiary care eye hospitals
located in four different countries. Using this longitudinal data, we achieved
state-of-the-art results for automatically detecting Glaucoma from a single raw
OCT using a 3D Deep Learning system. These results are close to human doctors
in a variety of settings across heterogeneous datasets and scanning
environments. To verify correctness and interpretability of the automated
categorization, we used saliency maps to find areas of focus for the model.
Matching human doctor behavior, the model predictions indeed correlated with
the conventional diagnostic parameters in the OCT printouts, such as the
retinal nerve fiber layer. We further used our model to find new areas in the
3D data that are presently not being identified as a diagnostic parameter to
detect glaucoma by human doctors. Namely, we found that the Lamina Cribrosa
(LC) region can be a valuable source of helpful diagnostic information
previously unavailable to doctors during routine clinical care because it lacks
a quantitative printout. Our model provides such volumetric quantification of
this region. We found that even when a majority of the RNFL is removed, the LC
region can distinguish glaucoma. This is clinically relevant in high myopes,
when the RNFL is already reduced, and thus the LC region may help differentiate
glaucoma in this confounding situation. We further generalize this approach to
create a new algorithm called DiagFind that provides a recipe for finding new
diagnostic information in medical imagery that may have been previously
unusable by doctors.

J0408$-$5354. This system is extraordinary for the presence of two sets of
multiple images at different redshifts, which provide the opportunity to obtain
more information at the cost of increased modelling complexity with respect to
previously analyzed systems. We perform detailed modelling of the mass
distribution for this lens system using three band Hubble Space Telescope
imaging. We combine the measured time delays, line-of-sight central velocity
dispersion of the deflector, and statistically constrained external convergence
with our lens models to estimate two cosmological distances. We measure the
""effective"" time-delay distance corresponding to the redshifts of the deflector
and the lensed quasar $D_{\Delta t}^{\rm eff}=3382^{+146}_{-115}$ Mpc and the
angular diameter distance to the deflector $D_{\rm d}=1711^{+376}_{-280}$ Mpc,
with covariance between the two distances. From these constraints on the
cosmological distances, we infer the Hubble constant $H_0 = 74.2^{+2.7}_{-3.0}$
km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and a uniform
prior for $\Omega_{\rm m}$ as $\Omega_{\rm m} \sim \mathcal{U}(0.05, 0.5)$.
This measurement gives the most precise constraint on $H_0$ to date from a
single lens. Our measurement is consistent with that obtained from the previous
sample of six lenses analyzed by the $H_0$ Lenses in COSMOGRAIL's Wellspring
(H0LiCOW) collaboration. It is also consistent with measurements of $H_0$ based
on the local distance ladder, reinforcing the tension with the inference from
early Universe probes, for example, with 2.2$\sigma$ discrepancy from the
cosmic microwave background measurement.

with the gap between the instruction throughput and the memory bandwidth of
current generation GPUs, our solver forms the tensor product linear system
on-the-fly without storing it in memory when performing matrix-vector dot
product operations in PCG. Such on-the-fly computation is accomplished by using
threads in a warp to cooperatively stream the adjacency and edge label matrices
of individual graphs by small square matrix blocks called tiles, which are then
staged in registers and the shared memory for later reuse. Warps across a
thread block can further share tiles via the shared memory to increase data
reuse. We exploit the sparsity of the graphs hierarchically by storing only
non-empty tiles using a coordinate format and nonzero elements within each tile
using bitmaps. Besides, we propose a new partition-based reordering algorithm
for aggregating nonzero elements of the graphs into fewer but denser tiles to
improve the efficiency of the sparse format.

primitives for tiles of various density and evaluate their performance on
synthetic and real-world datasets. Our solver delivers three to four orders of

gamma-ray source population. The galactic population on the other hand is
dominated by pulsars. Blazars and pulsars occupy different parameter space when
X-ray fluxes are compared with various gamma-ray properties. In this work, we
utilize the X-ray observations performed with the Swift-XRT for the unknown
Fermi sources and compare their X-ray and gamma-ray properties to differentiate
between the two source classes. We employ two machine learning algorithms,
decision tree and random forest classifier, to our high signal-to-noise ratio
sample of 217 sources, each of which correspond to Fermi unassociated regions.
The accuracy score for both methods were found to be 97% and 99%, respectively.
The random forest classifier, which is based on the application of a multitude
of decision trees, associated a probability value (P$_{bzr}$) for each source
to be a blazar. This yielded 173 blazar candidates with P$_{bzr}$ $\geq$ 90%
for each of these sources, and 134 of these possible blazar source associations
had P$_{bzr}$ $\geq$ 99%. The results yielded 13 sources with P$_{bzr}$ $\leq$
10%, which we deemed as reasonable candidates for pulsars, 7 of which result
with P$_{bzr}$ $\leq$ 1%. There were 31 sources that exhibited intermediate
probabilities and were termed ambiguous due to their unclear characterization
as a pulsar or a blazar.

achieved via decays of a heavy state that dominates the energy budget of the

interstellar medium (ISM; non-ionised gas and dust) from a galaxy. In addition,
dust grains can be destroyed in a hot or turbulent medium. The adopted
timescale of dust removal usually relies on uncertain theoretical estimates. It
is tricky to track the dust removal, because usually dust is constantly
replenished by consecutive generations of stars. Our objective is to measure
observationally the timescale of dust removal. We here explore an approach to
select galaxies which do have detectable amounts of dust and cold ISM but
exhibit a low current dust production rate. Any decrease of the dust and gas
content as a function of the age of such galaxies therefore must be attributed
to processes governing the ISM removal. We used a sample of galaxies detected
by Herschel in the far-infrared with visually assigned early-type morphology or
spirals with red colours. We also obtained JCMT/SCUBA-2 observations for five
of them. We discovered an exponential decline of the dust-to-stellar mass ratio
with age, which we interpret as an evolutionary trend of dust removal from
these galaxies. For the first time we directly measure the dust removal
timescale in such galaxies to be tau=(2.5+-0.4) Gyr (the corresponding
half-life time is (1.75+-0.25) Gyr). This quantity may be used in models in
which it must be assumed a priori and cannot be derived. Any process which
removes dust in these galaxies, such as dust grain destruction, cannot happen
on shorter timescales. The timescale is comparable to the quenching timescales
found in simulations for galaxies with similar stellar masses. The dust is
likely of internal, not external origin. It was either formed in the past
directly by supernovae, or from seeds produced by SNe and with grain growth in
the ISM contributing substantially to the dust mass accumulation.

essential to understand dust in galaxies. However, deep FIR observations
require a space mission, none of which are still active today. We aim to infer
the FIR emission across six Herschel bands, along with dust luminosity, mass,
and effective temperature, based on the available UV to mid-infrared (MIR)
observations. We also want to estimate the uncertainties of these predictions,
compare our method to energy balance SED fitting, and determine possible
limitations of the model. We propose a machine learning framework to predict
the FIR fluxes from 14 UV-MIR broadband fluxes. We used a low redshift sample
by combining DustPedia and H-ATLAS, and extracted Bayesian flux posteriors
through SED fitting. We trained shallow neural networks to predict the
far-infrared fluxes, uncertainties, and dust properties. We evaluated them on a
test set using a root mean square error (RMSE) in log-space. Our results (RMSE
= 0.19 dex) significantly outperform UV-MIR energy balance SED fitting (RMSE =
0.38 dex), and are inherently unbiased. We can identify when the predictions
are off, for example when the input has large uncertainties on WISE 22, or when
the input does not resemble the training set. The galaxies for which we have
UV-FIR observations can be used as a blueprint for galaxies that lack FIR data.
This results in a 'virtual FIR telescope', which can be applied to large
optical-MIR galaxy samples. This helps bridge the gap until the next FIR

shows that such theories can be defined on arbitrary spatial lattices in three

higher-form gauge theories to so-called $\mathfrak{F}_p$ gauge theories, in
which gauge transformations of rank-$k$ fields are specified by rank-$(k - p)$
gauge parameters. The $\mathbb{Z}_2$ rank-two theory of type $\mathfrak{F}_2$,
placed on a cubic lattice and coupled to scalar matter, is shown to have a
topological phase exactly dual to the well-known X-cube model. Generalizations
of this example yield novel fracton theories. In the continuum, the
$\mathrm{U}(1)$ rank-two theory of type $\mathfrak{F}_2$ is shown to have a
perturbatively gapless fracton regime that cannot be consistently interpreted
as a tensor gauge theory of any kind. The compact scalar fields that naturally
couple to this $\mathfrak{F}_2$ theory also show gapless fracton behavior; on a
cubic lattice they have a conserved $\mathrm{U}(1)$ charge and dipole moment,
but these particular charges are not necessarily conserved on more general
lattices. The construction straightforwardly generalizes to $\mathfrak{F}_2$
theories of nonabelian rank-two gauge fields, giving first examples of pure

combining our precision radial velocities with Gaia DR2 proper motions. Some
stars show unusual kinematics for their chemistries, including planar orbits,
unbound orbits, and highly elliptical orbits that plunge deeply into the

characterize such systems by introducing the notion of `statistically localized

but appear localized to sub-extensive regions when their expectation value is
taken in typical states with a finite density of particles. We illustrate this

destroy these integrals of motion in the bulk of the system, while keeping them
on the boundary. This results in statistically localized \emph{strong zero

thermalizing bulk, constituting the first example of such strong edge modes in

typical baselines of several years. We then search for subtle variations in the

assessing the fit quality to a damped random walk model. We identify 424
variability-selected AGN, including 244 with stellar masses between $10^{7}$

have narrow emission lines dominated by star formation. After controlling for
nucleus magnitude, the fraction of variable AGN is constant down to
$M_{\ast}=10^{9}~M_{\odot}$, suggesting no drastic decline in the BH occupation
fraction down to this stellar mass regime. Combining our NASA-Sloan Atlas
sample with samples of nearby galaxies with broad H$\alpha$ emission, we find
no dependence of variability properties with black hole mass. However, we
caution that the variable AGN fraction is strongly dependent on baseline. For
baselines less than two years, the variable fraction for the full sample is
0.25%, compared to 1.0% for baselines longer than two years. Finally, comparing
Stripe 82 light curves (Baldassare et al. 2018) to PTF light curves, we find
populations of changing-look AGN: 8 galaxies that are variable in Stripe 82,
but quiescent in PTF, and 15 galaxies where the reverse is true. Our PTF work
demonstrates the promise of long-term optical variability searches in low-mass
galaxies for finding AGNs missed by other selection techniques.

Newtonian gravity expectation given baryons alone below a characteristic
acceleration scale $g_{\dagger}\sim 10^{-8}\,\rm{cm\,s^{-2}}$, a scale promoted
to a new fundamental constant in MOND. In recent years, theoretical and
observational studies have shown that the star formation efficiency (SFE) of
dense gas scales with surface density, SFE $\sim \Sigma/\Sigma_{\rm crit}$ with
$\Sigma_{\rm crit} \sim \langle\dot{p}/m_{\ast}\rangle/(\pi\,G)\sim
1000\,\rm{M_{\odot}\,pc^{-2}}$ (where $\langle \dot{p}/m_{\ast}\rangle$ is the
momentum flux output by stellar feedback per unit stellar mass in a young
stellar population). We argue that the SFE, more generally, should scale with
the local gravitational acceleration, i.e. that SFE $\sim g_{\rm
tot}g_\mathrm{crit} \equiv (G\,M_{\rm tot}/R^{2}) /
\langle\dot{p}/m_{\ast}\rangle$, where $M_{\rm tot}$ is the total gravitating
mass and $g_\mathrm{crit}=\langle\dot{p}/m_{\ast}\rangle = \pi\,G\,\Sigma_{\rm

$g_\dagger$ may correspond to the characteristic acceleration scale above which
stellar feedback cannot prevent efficient star formation, and baryons will
eventually come to dominate. We further show how this may give rise to the
observed acceleration scaling $g_{\rm obs}\sim(g_{\rm
baryon}\,g_{\dagger})^{1/2}$ (where $g_{\rm baryon}$ is the acceleration due to
baryons alone) and flat rotation curves. The derived characteristic
acceleration $g_{\dagger}$ can be expressed in terms of fundamental constants

$g_{\dagger}\sim 0.1\,G\,m_{p}/\sigma_{\rm T}$.

shape research in the next decade and beyond: (1) What were the ""seeds"" of the
first quasars; how did some reach a billion solar masses before z$\sim7$? (2)
How does black hole growth change over cosmic time, and how did the early
growth of black holes shape their host galaxies? What can we learn from
intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) and dwarf galaxies today? (3) Can we
unravel the physics of black hole accretion, understanding both inflows and
outflows (jets and winds) in the context of the theory of general relativity?
Is it valid to use these insights to scale between stellar and supermassive
BHs, i.e., is black hole accretion really scale invariant? In the following, we
identify opportunities for the Canadian astronomical community to play a
leading role in addressing these issues, in particular by leveraging our strong
involvement in the Event Horizon Telescope, the {\it James Webb Space

broken supersymmetry and conformal invariance. At low temperature, a disordered
phase dual to a black brane geometry is unstable for low chemical potentials
and metastable for high values. In the metastable phase, states with a partial
Higgsing of the gauge group are favored over the normal disordered phase. This
is reflected in the properties of the effective potential for color branes in
the dual geometry, where the appearance of a global minimum outside the horizon
signals the onset of a brane nucleation instability. When the Higgsing involves
only one of the group factors, the global minimum remains at a finite distance
from the horizon, making it possible to construct holographic duals to
metastable ""color superconducting"" states. We also consider branes dual to

motion, which uses the tidal tensor to estimate the local dynamical timescale
and scales the timestep proportionally. This provides a better candidate for a
truly general-purpose gravitational timestep criterion than the usual
prescription derived from the gravitational acceleration, which does not
respect the equivalence principle, breaks down when $\mathbf{a}=0$, and does
not obey the same dimensional scaling as the true timescale of orbital motion.
We implement the tidal timestep criterion in the simulation code GIZMO, and
examine controlled tests of collisionless galaxy and star cluster models, as
well as fully-dynamic galaxy merger and cosmological dark matter simulations.
The tidal criterion estimates the dynamical time faithfully, and generally
provides a more efficient timestepping scheme compared to an acceleration
criterion. Specifically, the tidal criterion achieves order-of-magnitude
smaller energy errors for the same number of force evaluations in potentials
with inner profiles shallower than $\rho \propto r^{-1}$ (ie. where
$\mathbf{a}\rightarrow 0$), such as star clusters and cored galaxies. For a
given problem these advantages must be weighed against the additional overhead
of computing the tidal tensor on-the-fly, but in many cases this overhead is
small.

combining the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity. In this

bottom-up fashion, from the matrix dynamics of atoms of space-time-matter. We
use this relation to define a space-time-matter foam at the Planck scale, and
to argue that our theory is holographic. By coarse graining over time scales
larger than Planck time, one obtains the laws of quantum gravity. Quantum
gravity is not a Planck scale phenomenon; rather it comes into play whenever no
classical space-time background is available to describe a quantum system.
Space-time and classical general relativity arise from spontaneous localisation
in a highly entangled quantum gravitational system. The Karolyhazy relation
continues to hold in the emergent theory. An experimental confirmation of this

phase is realized by (i) formation of a bound state at the defect (except for
the periodic/antiperiodic boundary condition) and (ii) effective reversal of
the fermion number parity in one of the sectors (except for the open boundary
condition), resulting in a rather nontrivial crossover ``phase'' diagram in the
space of the boundary condition (defect strength) and mass.

free and Hubbard interacting lattice fermions when some magnetic fluxes are
threaded or gauge fields coupled. First, we focus on finding out the optimal
flux which minimizes the energy of fermions at specific fillings. For
spin-$1/2$ fermions at half-filling on a ring lattice consisting of
odd-numbered sites, the optimal flux turns out to be $\pm{\pi}/2$. We prove
this conclusion for Hubbard interacting fermions utilizing a generalized
reflection positivity technique, which can lead to further applications on 2D
nonbipartite lattices such as triangular and Kagome. At half-filling the
optimal flux patterns on the triangular and Kagome lattice are ascertained to
be $\pm[{\pi}/2,{\pi}/2]$, $\pm[{\pi}/2,{\pi}/2,0]$, respectively (see the
meaning of these notations in the main text). We also find that chirality
emerges in these optimal flux states. Then, we verify these exact conclusions
and further study some other fillings with the numerical exact diagonalization
method. It is found that when it deviates from half-filling, Hubbard
interactions can alter the optimal flux patterns on these lattices. Moreover,
numerically observed emergent flux singularities driven by strong Hubbard
interactions in the ground states, both in 1D and 2D, are discussed and
interpreted as some kind of non-Fermi liquid feature.

its physics, such as how much noise resilience it exhibits. Surprisingly, we

liquid can tolerate is not affected by the finite correlation length, making
the dimer model a viable model for studying RVB physics under perturbations.
Remarkably, we find that this is a universal phenomenon protected by
symmetries: First, the dominant correlations in the RVB are spinon
correlations, making the state robust against doping with visons. Second,
reflection symmetry stabilizes the spin liquid against doping with spinons, by
forbidding mixing of the initially dominant correlations with those which lead
to the breakdown of topological order.

We survey different classes of operators in the non-relativistic effective

complementary DD experiments with different targets and lowering the detection

ion beams to flat-top energy. A phase jump of the accelerating RF voltage with
respect to the phase of the bunches by about 180 degrees minus twice the
synchronous phase is required at the instant of transition. This phase offset
is injected into the beam phase loop which locks the phase of the vector sum of
the RF voltage in the cavities to the beam. The polarities of the cavity return
signal and of the stable phase programme are usually flipped at transition.
However, both actions are difficult to perfectly synchronize in time, causing
the beam phase loop to partially lock out and relock at the new stable phase.
The resulting glitch can be avoided by well-controlled phase jumps applied to
both, cavity drive and return signals simultaneously. This improved
implementation of transition crossing makes it virtually transparent to the
beam phase loop. The new scheme has been successfully tested with proton and
ion beams, and it will become fully operational in the CERN PS after the long
shutdown.

superiority of time-domain approaches to conventional time-frequency-based
methods. Unlike the time-frequency domain approaches, the time-domain
separation systems often receive input sequences consisting of a huge number of
time steps, which introduces challenges for modeling extremely long sequences.
Conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are not effective for modeling
such long sequences due to optimization difficulties, while one-dimensional
convolutional neural networks (1-D CNNs) cannot perform utterance-level
sequence modeling when its receptive field is smaller than the sequence length.
In this paper, we propose dual-path recurrent neural network (DPRNN), a simple
yet effective method for organizing RNN layers in a deep structure to model
extremely long sequences. DPRNN splits the long sequential input into smaller
chunks and applies intra- and inter-chunk operations iteratively, where the
input length can be made proportional to the square root of the original
sequence length in each operation. Experiments show that by replacing 1-D CNN
with DPRNN and apply sample-level modeling in the time-domain audio separation

practice, treatment effects are estimated with a small number of observations,
resulting in considerable fluctuations in treatment effect magnitude and
precision depending upon the covariates chosen. This practice thus incentivizes
researchers to select covariates which maximize treatment effect statistical
significance rather than precision. Here, I propose a principled approach for
estimating RDDs which provides a means of improving precision with covariates
while minimizing adverse incentives. This is accomplished by integrating the
adaptive LASSO, a machine learning method, into RDD estimation using an R
package developed for this purpose, adaptiveRDD. Using simulations, I show that
this method significantly improves treatment effect precision, particularly

realizations in which the rightmost lead particle is very far ahead of its
expected position - but still within a distance smaller than the diffusion
radius $\sim\sqrt{t}$. Our approach consists in a study of the generating
function $G_{\Delta x}(\lambda)=\sum_n \lambda^n p_n(\Delta x)$ for the
probabilities $p_n(\Delta x)$ of observing $n$ particles in an interval of
given size $\Delta x$ from the lead particle to its left, fixing the position
of the latter. This generating function can be expressed with the help of
functions solving the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov (FKPP) equation
with suitable initial conditions. In the infinite-time and large-$\Delta x$
limits, we find that the mean number of particles in the interval grows
exponentially with $\Delta x$, and that the generating function obeys a
nontrivial scaling law, depending on $\Delta x$ and $\lambda$ through the
combined variable $[\Delta x-f(\lambda)]^{3}/\Delta x^2$, where
$f(\lambda)\equiv -\ln(1-\lambda)-\ln[-\ln(1-\lambda)]$. From this property,
one may conjecture that the growth of the typical particle number with the size
of the interval is slower than exponential, but, surprisingly enough, only by a
subleading factor at large $\Delta x$. The scaling we argue is consistent with
results from a numerical integration of the FKPP equation.

multiple items or services are available to be shared among a set of interested

determining for each item the set of players who are granted service, together
with respective payments. Although there are several works studying specialized
versions of such problems, there has been almost no progress for general
combinatorial cost sharing domains until recently \cite{DobzinskiO17}. The main
goal of our work is to further understand this interplay in terms of budget
balance and social cost approximation. Towards this, we provide a refinement of
cross-monotonicity (trace-monotonicity) that is applicable to iterative
mechanisms. The trace here refers to the order in which players become
finalized. On top of this, we also provide two parameterizations of cost
functions which capture the behavior of their average cost-shares. Based on our
trace-monotonicity property, we design a scheme of ascending cost sharing
mechanisms which is applicable to the combinatorial cost sharing setting with
symmetric submodular valuations. Using our first cost function
parameterization, we identify conditions under which our mechanism is weakly
group-strategyproof, $O(1)$-budget-balanced and $O(H_n)$-approximate with
respect to the social cost. Finally, we consider general valuation functions
and exploit our second parameterization to derive a more fine-grained analysis
of the Sequential Mechanism introduced by Moulin. This mechanism is budget
balanced by construction, but in general only guarantees a poor social cost
approximation of $n$. We identify conditions under which the mechanism achieves
improved social cost approximation guarantees.

answered. Suppose regression observations
$(X_1,Y_1),\ldots,(X_n,Y_n)\in\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{R}$ (not necessarily
independent) are available. Some of the questions we deal with are as follows:
under what conditions, does the OLS estimator converge and what is the limit?
What happens if the dimension is allowed to grow with $n$? What happens if the
observations are dependent with dependence possibly strengthening with $n$? How
to do statistical inference under these kinds of misspecification? What happens
to the OLS estimator under variable selection? How to do inference under
misspecification and variable selection?
  We answer all the questions raised above with one simple deterministic
inequality which holds for any set of observations and any sample size. This
implies that all our results are a finite sample (non-asymptotic) in nature. In
the end, one only needs to bound certain random quantities under specific
settings of interest to get concrete rates and we derive these bounds for the
case of independent observations. In particular, the problem of inference after
variable selection is studied, for the first time, when $d$, the number of
covariates increases (almost exponentially) with sample size $n$. We provide

function on $X$. We can mention cases such as: transcendental maps of
$\mathbb{C}$, meromorphic maps on compact complex varieties, or continuous
self-maps $f:U\rightarrow U$ of a dense open subset $U\subset X$ where $X$ is a
compact metric space. To the maps mentioned in the previous paragraph, the use
of measures is not sufficient to establish the basic properties of ergodic
theory, such as the existence of invariant measures or a reasonable definition
of measure theoretic entropy and topological entropy. In this paper, we show
that strong submeasures can be used to completely resolve the issue and
establish these basic properties. The same idea can also be applied to improve
on \'etale topological entropy, previously defined by the author. In another
paper we apply strong submeasures to intersection of positive closed $(1,1)$
currents on compact K\""ahler manifolds.

helium-rich Type Ib SN that reappeared as a strong H$\alpha$-emitting
point-source on narrowband H$\alpha$ images. We present follow-up optical
spectroscopy that reveals the presence of a broad H$\alpha$ component with full

of an ejecta-CSM interaction. We also present observations with the XMM-Newton
Observatory, the Swift satellite, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory that span
10 days to 15 years after discovery. The detection of strong radio, X-ray, and
H$\alpha$ emission years after explosion allows various constraints to be put
on pre-SN mass-loss processes. We present a wind-bubble model in which the CSM
is ""pre-prepared"" by a fast wind interacting with a slow wind. Much of the
outer density profile into which the SN explodes corresponds to no steady-state
mass-loss process. We estimate that the shell of compressed slow wind material
was ejected ~1400 yr prior to explosion, perhaps during carbon burning, and
that the SN shock had swept up about 0.04 M_sun of material. The region
emitting the H$\alpha$ has a density of order $10^{-20}$ g/cc.

This
biases the observed tangential shear profiles around galaxies, the so-called
galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) signal, and the related excess mass profile.
Correspondingly, inference of physical quantities, such as the mean mass
profile of halos around galaxies, are affected by magnification effects. We use
simulated shear and galaxy data of the Millennium Simulation to quantify the
effect on shear and mass estimates from magnified lens and source number
counts. The former are due to the large-scale matter distribution in the
foreground of the lenses, the latter are caused by magnification of the source
population by the matter associated with the lenses. The GGL signal is
calculated from the simulations by an efficient fast-Fourier transform that can
also be applied to real data. The numerical treatment is complemented by a
leading-order analytical description of the magnification effects, which is
shown to fit the numerical shear data well. We find the magnification effect is
strongest for steep galaxy luminosity functions and high redshifts. For a lens
redshift of $z_\mathrm{d}=0.83$, a limiting magnitude of $22\,\mathrm{mag}$ in
the $r$-band and a source redshift of $z_\mathrm{s}=0.99$, we find that a
magnification correction changes the shear profile up to $45\%$ and the mass is
biased by up to $55 \%$. For medium-redshift galaxies the relative change in
shear and mass is typically a few percent. As expected, the sign of the bias
depends on the local slope of the lens luminosity function $\alpha_\mathrm{d}$,
where the mass is biased low for $\alpha_\mathrm{d}<1$ and biased high for
$\alpha_\mathrm{d}>1$. Whereas the magnification effect of sources is rarely
than more $1\%$, the statistical power of future weak lensing surveys warrants
correction for this effect.

ability to accomplish tasks in a decentralized manner, making them more robust
to failures. Due to the difficulty in running experiments with large numbers of
hardware agents, researchers often make simplifying assumptions and remove
constraints that might be present in a real swarm deployment. While simplifying
away some constraints is tolerable, we feel that two in particular have been
overlooked: one, that agents in a swarm take up physical space, and two, that
agents might be damaged in collisions. Many existing works assume agents have
negligible size or pass through each other with no added penalty. It seems
possible to ignore these constraints using collision avoidance, but we show
using an illustrative example that this is easier said than done. In
particular, we show that collision avoidance can interfere with the intended
swarming behavior and significant parameter tuning is necessary to ensure the
behavior emerges as best as possible while collisions are avoided. We compare
four different collision avoidance algorithms, two of which we consider to be
the best decentralized collision avoidance algorithms available. Despite
putting significant effort into tuning each algorithm to perform at its best,
we believe our results show that further research is necessary to develop

passage of particles through matter and to predict effects such as detector
efficiencies and smearing. Geant4 uses many underlying models to predict
particle interaction kinematics, and uncertainty in these models leads to
uncertainty in high energy physics measurements. The Geant4 collaboration
recently made free parameters in some models accessible through partnership
with Geant4 developers. We present a study of the impact of varying parameters
in three Geant4 hadronic physics models on agreement with thin target datasets
and describe fits to these datasets using the Professor model tuning framework.
We find that varying parameters produces substantially better agreement with
some datasets, but that more degrees of freedom are required for full
agreement. This work is a first step towards a common framework for propagating
uncertainties in Geant4 models to high energy physics measurements, and we
outline future work required to complete that goal.

The cable-driven nature of many surgical robots allows the systems to be

uncertainties are brought into the kinematics calculation. Since the reported

trade-off. We address the task of efficiently solving a parameterized graph
clustering objective for all values of a resolution parameter. Specifically, we
consider an objective we call LambdaPrime, involving a parameter $\lambda \in
(0,1)$. This objective is related to other parameterized clustering problems,
such as parametric generalizations of modularity, and captures a number of
specific clustering problems as special cases, including sparsest cut and
cluster deletion. While previous work provides approximation results for a
single resolution parameter, we seek a set of approximately optimal clusterings
for all values of $\lambda$ in polynomial time. In particular, we ask the
question, how small a family of clusterings suffices to optimize -- or to
approximately optimize -- the LambdaPrime objective over the full possible
spectrum of $\lambda$?
  We obtain a family of logarithmically many clusterings by solving the
parametric linear programming relaxation of LambdaPrime at a logarithmic number
of parameter values, and round their solutions using existing approximation
algorithms. We prove that this number is tight up to a constant factor.
Specifically, for a certain class of ring graphs, a logarithmic number of
feasible solutions is required to provide a constant-factor approximation for
the LambdaPrime LP relaxation in all parameter regimes. We additionally show
that for any graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, there exists a set of $m$ or
fewer clusterings such that for every $\lambda \in (0,1)$, the family contains
an exact solution to the LambdaPrime objective. There also exists a set of
$O(\log n)$ clusterings that provide a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate solution
in all parameter regimes; we demonstrate simple graph classes for which these
bounds are tight.

spite of the fact that such long periods are not a measure of quality, and they
require a large amount of memory. Even at the time of its publication, several

will use noble liquid gases, such as nEXO, DARWIN, DarkSide-20k, and DUNE.
Little information is currently available about reflectivity and PDE in liquid
noble gases, because such measurements are difficult to conduct in a cryogenic
environment and at short enough wavelengths. Here we report a measurement of
specular reflectivity and relative PDE of Hamamatsu VUV4 silicon
photomultipliers (SiPMs) with 50 micrometer micro-cells conducted with xenon
scintillation light (~175 nm) in liquid xenon. The specular reflectivity at 15
deg. incidence of three samples of VUV4 SiPMs is found to be 30.4+/-1.4%,
28.6+/-1.3%, and 28.0+/-1.3%, respectively. The PDE at normal incidence differs
by +/-8% (standard deviation) among the three devices. The angular dependence
of the reflectivity and PDE was also measured for one of the SiPMs. Both the
reflectivity and PDE decrease as the angle of incidence increases. This is the
first measurement of an angular dependence of PDE and reflectivity of a SiPM in
liquid xenon.

  Learning in Healthcare",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed representations have been used to support downstream tasks in
healthcare recently. Healthcare data (e.g., electronic health records) contain
multiple modalities of data from heterogeneous sources that can provide
complementary information, alongside an added dimension to learning
personalized patient representations. To this end, in this paper we propose a
novel unsupervised encoder-decoder model, namely Mixed Pooling Multi-View
Attention Autoencoder (MPVAA), that generates patient representations
encapsulating a holistic view of their medical profile. Specifically, by first
learning personalized graph embeddings pertaining to each patient's
heterogeneous healthcare data, it then integrates the non-linear relationships
among them into a unified representation through multi-view attention
mechanism. Additionally, a mixed pooling strategy is incorporated in the
encoding step to learn diverse information specific to each data modality.
Experiments conducted for multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed model over the state-of-the-art representation learning methods in
healthcare.

former dwarf galaxy. In this study, we investigate the kinematics and chemical
composition in 13 stars selected as TriAnd candidates from 2MASS photometry.
The sample was observed using the GRACES high-resolution spectrograph attached
to the Gemini North telescope. Based on radial velocities obtained from the
spectra and the astrometric data from GAIA, three different kinematic criteria
were used to classify our sample stars as belonging to the TriAnd overdensity.
The TriAnd confirmed members in our sample span a range in metallicities,
including two metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] $\sim$ -1.3 dex). We show that the
adopted kinematical classification also chemically segregates TriAnd and
non-TriAnd members of our sample, indicating a unique chemical pattern of the
TriAnd stars. Our results indicate different chemical patterns for the [Na/Fe],
[Al/Fe], [Ba/Fe], and [Eu/Fe] ratios in the TriAnd stars when compared to the
chemical pattern of the local disk; the paucity of studies chemically
characterizing the outer disk population of the Milky Way is the main obstacle
in establishing that the TriAnd population is chemically similar to field stars
in the outer disk. But TriAnd chemical pattern is reminiscent of that found in
outer disk open clusters, although the latter are significantly more metal-rich
than TriAnd.

cornerstone of the proposed attack is to actively explore the complex

the obstacle-avoidance knowledge exhibited in the limited observations of its
behaviors. Then, we propose shortest-path and hands-off attack algorithms to
find efficient attack paths from the tremendous motion space, achieving the

recent research interest into algorithms that automatically search for compact

search algorithms are those that are guided by baseline network architectures.
Such algorithms have been shown to be significantly more computationally

and empirical analysis of four different state-of-the-art compact architecture
search algorithms: i) group lasso regularization, ii) variational dropout, iii)

periodic potential near the edges of the spectrum. A well known conjecture says
that generically (with respect to perturbations of the periodic potential) the
extrema are attained by a single branch of the dispersion relation, are
isolated, and have non-degenerate Hessian (i.e., dispersion relations are
graphs of Morse functions). The important notion of effective masses in solid
state physics, as well as Liouville property, Green's function asymptotics,
etc. hinge upon this property. The progress in proving this conjecture has been
slow. It is natural to try to look at discrete problems, where the dispersion
relation is (in appropriate coordinates) an algebraic, rather than analytic,
variety. Such models are often used for computation in solid state physics (the
tight binding model). Alas, counterexamples exist in some discrete situations.
We start establishing the following dichotomy: the non-degeneracy of extrema
either fails or holds in the complement of a proper algebraic subset of the
parameters.
  The known counterexample has only two free parameters. This might be too
tight for genericity to hold. We consider the maximal $Z^2$-periodic two-atomic
nearest-cell interaction graph, with nine edges per unit cell and the discrete
""Laplace-Beltrami"" operator on it. We then use methods from computational and
combinatorial algebraic geometry to prove the genericity conjecture for this
graph. We show three different approaches to the genericity, which might be
suitable in various situations.
  It is also proven in this case that adding more parameters does not destroy
the genericity result. We list all ""bad"" periodic subgraphs of the one we

  Human-Like Cognitive Style","ICCV 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image captioning is a research hotspot where encoder-decoder models combining
convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) achieve
promising results. Despite significant progress, these models generate
sentences differently from human cognitive styles. Existing models often
generate a complete sentence from the first word to the end, without
considering the influence of the following words on the whole sentence
generation. In this paper, we explore the utilization of a human-like cognitive
style, i.e., building overall cognition for the image to be described and the
sentence to be constructed, for enhancing computer image understanding. This
paper first proposes a Mutual-aid network structure with Bidirectional LSTMs
(MaBi-LSTMs) for acquiring overall contextual information. In the training
process, the forward and backward LSTMs encode the succeeding and preceding
words into their respective hidden states by simultaneously constructing the
whole sentence in a complementary manner. In the captioning process, the LSTM
implicitly utilizes the subsequent semantic information contained in its hidden
states. In fact, MaBi-LSTMs can generate two sentences in forward and backward
directions. To bridge the gap between cross-domain models and generate a
sentence with higher quality, we further develop a cross-modal attention
mechanism to retouch the two sentences by fusing their salient parts as well as
the salient areas of the image. Experimental results on the Microsoft COCO
dataset show that the proposed model improves the performance of
encoder-decoder models and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Lagrangian transport equations in Eulerian-Lagrangian formulations. To ensure a
semi-Lagrangian approximation that is consistent with an explicit Eulerian,
discontinuous spectral element method (DSEM) discretization used for the
Eulerian formulation, Lagrangian particles are seeded at Gauss quadrature
collocation nodes within an element. The particles are integrated explicitly in
time to obtain an advected polynomial solution at the advected Gauss quadrature
locations. This approximation is mapped back in a semi-Lagrangian fashion to
the Gauss quadrature points through a least squares fit using constraints for
element boundary values and optional constraints for mass and energy
preservation. An explicit time integration is used for the semi-Lagrangian
approximation that is consistent with the grid based DSEM solver, which ensures
that particles seeded at the Gauss quadrature points do not leave the element's
bounds. The method is hence local and parallel and facilitates the solution of
the Lagrangian formulation without the grid complexity, and parallelization
challenges of a particle solver in particle-mesh methods. Numerical tests with
one and two dimensional advection equation are carried out. The method
converges exponentially. The use of mass and energy constraints can improve
accuracy depending on the accuracy of the time integration.

matched layer (PML) for three and two space dimensional linear elastodynamics,
in velocity-stress formulation, subject to well-posed linear boundary
conditions. First, we consider the elastodynamics equation, in a cuboidal
domain, and derive an unsplit PML truncating the domain using complex
coordinate stretching. Leveraging the hyperbolic structure of the underlying
system, we construct continuous energy estimates, in the time domain for the
elastic wave equation, and in the Laplace space for a sequence of PML model
problems, with variations in one, two and three space dimensions, respectively.
They correspond to PMLs normal to boundary faces, along edges and in corners.
Second, we develop a DG numerical method for the linear elastodynamics equation
using physically motivated numerical flux and penalty parameters, which are
compatible with all well-posed, internal and external, boundary conditions.
When the PML damping vanishes, by construction, our choice of penalty
parameters yield an upwind scheme and a discrete energy estimate analogous to
the continuous energy estimate. Third, to ensure numerical stability of the
discretization when PML damping is present, it is necessary to extend the
numerical DG fluxes, and the numerical inter-element and boundary procedures,
to the PML auxiliary differential equations. This is crucial for deriving
discrete energy estimates analogous to the continuous energy estimates. By
combining the DG spatial approximation with the high order ADER time stepping
scheme and the accuracy of the PML we obtain an arbitrarily accurate wave
propagation solver in the time domain. Numerical experiments are presented in
two and three space dimensions corroborating the theoretical results.

Survey DR1, which covers nearly the full Southern hemisphere with six-filter
sequences that are repeatedly observed in the passbands $uvgriz$. This allows
us to identify bona-fide flares in single-epoch observations on timescales of
less than four minutes. Using a correlation-based outlier search algorithm we
find 254 flare events in the amplitude range of $\Delta u \sim 0.1$ to 5~mag.
In agreement with previous work, we observe the flaring fraction of M dwarfs to
increase from $\sim 30$ to $\sim $1,000 per million stars for spectral types M0
to M5. We also confirm the decrease in flare fraction with larger vertical
distance from the Galactic plane that is expected from declining stellar
activity with age. Based on precise distances from Gaia DR2, we find a steep
decline in the flare fraction from the plane to 150~pc vertical distance and a
significant flattening towards larger distances. We then reassess the strong
type dependence in the flaring fraction with a volume-limited sample within a
distance of 50~pc from the Sun: in this sample the trend disappears and we find
instead a constant fraction of $\sim$1,650 per million stars for spectral types
M1 to M5. Finally, large-amplitude flares with $\Delta i > 1$ mag are very rare
with a fraction of $\sim 0.5$ per million M dwarfs. Hence, we expect that
M-dwarf flares will not confuse SkyMapper's search for kilonovae from
gravitational-wave events.

most of the planets, the main parameters that can be measured are planetary
radius and mass. Based on these two parameters, surface gravity can be
estimated. In this work, we investigate the effects of varying radius and
gravity on the climate of rapidly rotating terrestrial planets with assuming
they have an ocean and Earth-like atmospheres (N$_2$, CO$_2$, and H$_2$O).
Using a three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric general circulation model (GCM), we
find that varying radius mainly influences the equator-to-pole surface
temperature difference while varying gravity mainly influences the mean surface
temperature. For planets of larger radii, the meridional atmospheric energy
transport is weaker, which warms the tropics but cools high latitudes. For
planets of larger gravities, the surface is globally cooler due to the fact
that saturated vapor pressure depends on air temperature only and column water
vapor mass is approximately equal to saturated vapor pressure over gravity
multiplied by relative humidity. The relative humidity does not change much in
our experiments. Ice albedo and water vapor feedbacks act to further amplify
the effects of varying radius and gravity. These results suggest that radius
and gravity are important factors for planetary climate, although they are not
as critical as stellar flux, atmospheric composition and mass, and rotation
rate. Future simulations are required to know how large the radius and gravity
could influence the width of the habitable zone using 3D GCMs.

One type of dynamics that has attracted increasing attention because of its
several potential implications is opinion formation. A phenomenon of particular
importance, known to take place in opinion formation, is echo chambers'
appearance. In the present work, we approach this phenomenon, while emphasizing
the influence of contrarian opinions in a multi-opinion scenario. To define the
contrarian opinion, we considered the Underdog effect, which is the eventual
tendency of people to support the less popular option. We also considered an
adaptation of the Sznajd dynamics with the possibility of friendship rewiring,
performed on several network models. We analyze the relationship between
topology and opinion dynamics by considering two measurements: opinion
diversity and network modularity. Two specific situations have been addressed:
(i) the agents can reconnect only with others sharing the same opinion; and
(ii) same as in the previous case, but with the agents reconnecting only within
a limited neighborhood. This choice can be justified because, in general,
friendship is a transitive property along with subsequent neighborhoods (e.g.,
two friends of a person tend to know each other). As the main results, we found
that the Underdog effect, if strong enough, can balance the agents' opinions.
On the other hand, this effect decreases the possibilities of echo-chamber
formation. We also found that the restricted reconnection case reduced the
chances of echo chamber formation and led to smaller echo chambers.

In this paper, we introduce an embedding framework to learn
semantically-plausible distributed representations of clinical notes that
exploits the semantic correspondence between the unstructured texts and their
corresponding structured knowledge, known as semantic frame, in a hierarchical
fashion. Our approach integrates text modeling and semantic correspondence
learning into a single model that comprises 1) an unstructured embedding module
that makes use of self-similarity matrix representations in order to inject
structural regularities of different segments inherent in clinical texts to
promote local coherence, 2) a structured embedding module to embed the semantic
frames (e.g., UMLS semantic types) with deep ConvNet and 3) a hierarchical
semantic correspondence module that embeds by enhancing the interactions
between text-semantic frame embedding pairs at multiple levels (i.e., words,
sentence, note). Evaluations on multiple embedding benchmarks on post discharge

by the recent demonstration of a BCS polariton laser {[}Hu \textit{et al.},
arXiv:1902.00142{]} and based on a simplified short-range description of the
electron-hole attraction, we examine the role of quantum fluctuations in an
exciton-polariton condensate at thermal equilibrium and determine the number of
different type carriers at the crossover beyond mean-field. Near Mott density
and with ultra-strong light-matter coupling, we find an unexpectedly large
phase window for a strongly correlated BCS polariton condensate, where both
fermionic Bogoliubov quasi-particles and bosonic excitons are significantly
populated and strongly couple to photons. We predict its photoluminescence
spectra and show that the upper polariton energy gets notably renormalized,
giving rise to a high-energy side-peak at large carrier density, as observed in
recent experiments.

of data, usually with a two-stage cluster design with stratification by region

geographic scale. In this paper we investigate the extent to which accounting
for sample design can affect predictions at the aggregate level, which is
usually the target of inference. We describe a simulation study in which
realistic sampling frames are created for Kenya, based on population and
demographic information, with a survey design that mimics a Demographic Health

models. We also describe a cluster level model with a discrete spatial
smoothing prior that has not been previously used, but provides reliable
inference. We find that including stratification and cluster level random
effects can improve predictive performance. Spatially smoothed direct
(weighted) estimates were robust to priors and survey design. Continuous

these models require the most ""hand holding"". Subsequently, we examine how the

problems, where explicit gradient forms are difficult or infeasible to obtain.
In this paper, we propose a zeroth-order AdaMM (ZO-AdaMM) algorithm, that
generalizes AdaMM to the gradient-free regime. We show that the convergence
rate of ZO-AdaMM for both convex and nonconvex optimization is roughly a factor
of $O(\sqrt{d})$ worse than that of the first-order AdaMM algorithm, where $d$

Furthermore, we demonstrate two applications, designing per-image and universal

mitigating the effect of stragglers (slow or failed nodes) in distributed
matrix computations. For a system with $n$ worker nodes where $s$ can be
stragglers, these approaches allow for an optimal recovery threshold, whereby
the intended result can be decoded as long as any $(n-s)$ worker nodes complete
their tasks. However, they suffer from serious numerical issues owing to the
condition number of the corresponding real Vandermonde-structured recovery
matrices; this condition number grows exponentially in $n$. We present a novel
approach that leverages the properties of circulant permutation matrices and
rotation matrices for coded matrix computation. In addition to having an
optimal recovery threshold, we demonstrate an upper bound on the worst-case
condition number of our recovery matrices which grows as $\approx
O(n^{s+5.5})$; in the practical scenario where $s$ is a constant, this grows
polynomially in $n$. Our schemes leverage the well-behaved conditioning of
complex Vandermonde matrices with parameters on the complex unit circle, while
still working with computation over the reals. Exhaustive experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed method has condition numbers that are orders of

three-body interaction is scale invariant in one dimension. However, upon
quantization, an anomaly appears which breaks the scale invariance. This is
very similar to the physics of two-component fermions in two spatial
dimensions, where the two-body interaction is also anomalous. Previous studies
have already hinted that the physics of these two systems are intimately
related. Here we expand upon those studies by examining the thermodynamic
properties of this anomalous one dimensional system in the high temperature

anomalous interaction in two dimensions, to that of three-body interaction in
one dimension. This result is valid in the high temperature limit, where the
thermodynamics can be understood in terms of few-body correlations.

photoionization, radiation pressure sweeping, thermal fracture and sublimation
of ice. We find some of them capable of producing the meteoroid-scale

consideration of the recent precedents (e.g. asteroid (6478) Gault), possibly
releasing mm-cm scale dust particles. Impacts by micrometeorites with size
$\simeq$1mm could be a trigger for ejecting the cm-sized particles. Radiation
pressure can sweep out the mm-sized dust particles, while not sufficient for
the cm-sized. For the other mechanisms, unprovable or unidentified. The

birds-eye view, where objects preserve their physical dimensions and are

sparse and have highly variable point density, which may cause detectors
difficulties in detecting distant or small objects (pedestrians, traffic signs,
etc.). On the other hand, perspective view provides dense observations, which
could allow more favorable feature encoding for such cases. In this paper, we
aim to synergize the birds-eye view and the perspective view and propose a
novel end-to-end multi-view fusion (MVF) algorithm, which can effectively learn
to utilize the complementary information from both. Specifically, we introduce
dynamic voxelization, which has four merits compared to existing voxelization
methods, i) removing the need of pre-allocating a tensor with fixed size; ii)
overcoming the information loss due to stochastic point/voxel dropout; iii)
yielding deterministic voxel embeddings and more stable detection outcomes; iv)
establishing the bi-directional relationship between points and voxels, which
potentially lays a natural foundation for cross-view feature fusion. By
employing dynamic voxelization, the proposed feature fusion architecture
enables each point to learn to fuse context information from different views.
MVF operates on points and can be naturally extended to other approaches using
LiDAR point clouds. We evaluate our MVF model extensively on the newly released
Waymo Open Dataset and on the KITTI dataset and demonstrate that it
significantly improves detection accuracy over the comparable single-view

areas in the 5th generation (5G) of mobile standards to enable connectivity of
a massive number of internet of things (IoT) devices with little or no human
intervention. In conventional human-type communications (HTC), due to the
limited number of available radio resources and orthogonal/non-overlapping
nature of existing resource allocation techniques, users need to compete for
connectivity through a random access (RA) process, which may turn into a
performance bottleneck in mMTC. In this context, non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA) has emerged as a potential technology that allows overlapping of
multiple users over a radio resource, thereby creating an opportunity to enable
more autonomous and grant-free communication, where devices can transmit data
whenever they need. The existing literature on NOMA schemes majorly considers
centralized scheduling based HTC, where users are already connected, and
various system parameters like spreading sequences, interleaving patterns,
power control, etc., are predefined. Contrary to HTC, mMTC traffic is different
with mostly uplink communication, small data size per device, diverse quality
of service, autonomous nature, and massive number of devices. Hence, the
signaling overhead and latency of centralized scheduling becomes a potential
performance bottleneck. To tackle this, grant-free access is needed, where mMTC
devices can autonomously transmit their data over randomly chosen radio
resources. This article, in contrast to existing surveys, comprehensively
discusses the recent advances in NOMA from a grant-free connectivity
perspective. Moreover, related practical challenges and future directions are
discussed.

flow field mapping capability with in-situ flow velocity observations. This
approach is of importance to underwater vehicles in mid-depth oceans or aerial

efficiencies, electric vehicles have received worldwide attention. For
convenient centralized management, taxis are considered as the fleet with
electrification priority. In this work, we focus on the study on electric taxis
dispatching, with consideration of picking up customers and recharging, based
on real world traffic data of a large number of taxis in Beijing. First, the
assumed electric taxi charging stations are located using the K mean method.
Second, based on the station locations and the order demands, which are in form
of origin-destination pairs and extracted from the trajectory data, a
dispatching strategy as well as the simulation framework is developed with
consideration of reducing customer waiting time, mitigating electric taxi
charging congestion, and balancing order number distribution among electric
taxis. The proposed method models the electric taxi charging behaviors
temporally discretely from the aspects of charging demands and availability of
chargers, and further incorporates a centralized and intelligent fleet
dispatching platform, which is capable of handling taxi service requests and
arranging electric taxis' recharging in real time. The methodology in this
paper is readily applicable to dispatching of different types of electric
vehicle fleet with similar dataset available. Among the method, we use queueing
theory to model the electric vehicle charging station waiting phenomena and
include this factor into dispatching platform. Carbon emission is also surveyed
and analyzed.

the further developments into the three-dimensional (3D) integrations, although
their designs and fabrications are still challenges. In this paper we
demonstrate an analytical method, basing on the invariant engineering, to
overcome the complication in the usual method by numerically solving the
relevant 3D coupled-mode equations for designing various 3D optical waveguide
devices such as the typical couplers. Our method is based on the
quantum-optical analogy, i.e., the Maxwell equation for the electrcomagnetic
wave prorogating along the waveguide structure in the spatial domain is
formally similar to the Schr\""odinger equation for the evolving quantum state
in the time domain. We find that the spatial-domain invariants can be
effectively constructed to solve the 3D coupled-mode equations, analogously to
solve the dynamical evolutions of quantum systems in the time-domain. As a
consequence, as long as appropriately set the coupling parameters between the
3D interconnected waveguides, the 3D three-waveguide couplers could be designed
for various desirably power divisions. As the invariant method is a natural
shortcut to the adiabaticity, the compacted devices designed by the
invariant-based engineerings are robust against the coupling coefficient
variations and the coupler lengths.

hence, enable a cost-effective roll-out of the technology across the driving
population. While it has been shown that three-dimensional (3D) operations are
more suitable for spatiotemporal feature learning, current methods for
drowsiness detection commonly use frame-based, multi-step approaches. However,
computationally expensive techniques that achieve superior results on action
recognition benchmarks (e.g. 3D convolutions, optical flow extraction) create
bottlenecks for real-time, safety-critical applications on mobile devices.
Here, we show how depthwise separable 3D convolutions, combined with an early
fusion of spatial and temporal information, can achieve a balance between high
prediction accuracy and real-time inference requirements. In particular,
increased accuracy is achieved when assessment requires motion information, for
example, when sunglasses conceal the eyes. Further, a custom TensorFlow-based
smartphone application shows the true impact of various approaches on inference
times and demonstrates the effectiveness of real-time monitoring based on
out-of-sample data to alert a drowsy driver. Our model is pre-trained on

role identification, rooted kernels with structural dependencies kept are built
to better integrate network embedding methods. To demonstrate the effectiveness

anisotropy. The magnetic properties under the transverse fields for the
spin-1/2 model are very similar to those for the spin-1 model [K. Suzuki and K.
Hattori, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 88, 024707 (2019).]. For the superconducting
correlations, we analyze various Cooper pairs within nearest-neighbor pairs
including composite ones between the local spins and the electrons. We find
that, for the spin-1/2 model, the superconducting correlations are highly
enhanced in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid state near the Kondo-plateau phase,
where the conduction electrons and the local spins are strongly coupled with a
finite spin gap for the Ising axis. This is a clear contrast to the model under
the longitudinal magnetic fields, where there are no noticeable superconducting
correlations. Competitions between the transverse magnetic field and the Kondo
singlet formation lead to this enhanced superconducting correlations. For the
spin-1 model, the single-ion anisotropy suppresses the superconducting
correlation and there is no noticeable enhancement. We also examine the large

convolution filters. Training is performed in an interleaved fashion; some
batches undergo the regular forward and backpropagation passes with original
network parameters, whereas others undergo a forward pass with pooled filters
and downsampled inputs. Since pooling is differentiable, the gradients of the
pooled filters propagate to the original network parameters for a standard
parameter update. The latter phase requires fewer floating point operations and
less storage due to the reduced spatial dimensions in feature maps and filters.
The key idea is that this phase leads to smaller and approximate updates and
thus slower learning, but at significantly reduced cost, followed by passes
that use the original network parameters as a refinement stage. Deciding how
often and for which batches the downsmapling occurs can be done either
stochastically or deterministically, and can be defined as a training
hyperparameter itself. Experiments on residual architectures show that we can
achieve up to 23% reduction in training time with minimal loss in validation

that the total relative helicity normalized to the magnetic flux at the NLFF

maximize the energy efficiency of the entire system by effectively controlling
carried load on networked servers. A scalable, near-optimal job-assignment
policy is proposed. The optimality is gauged as, roughly speaking, energy cost
per job. Our key result is an upper bound on the deviation between the proposed
policy and the asymptotically optimal energy efficiency, when job sizes are
exponentially distributed and blocking probabilities are positive. Relying on
Whittle relaxation and the asymptotic optimality theorem of Weber and Weiss,
this bound is shown to decrease exponentially as the number of servers and the
arrival rates of jobs increase arbitrarily and in proportion. In consequence,
the proposed policy is asymptotically optimal and, more importantly, approaches
asymptotic optimality quickly (exponentially). This suggests that the proposed
policy is close to optimal even for relatively small systems (and indeed any
larger systems), and this is consistent with the results of our simulations.
Simulations indicate that the policy is effective, and robust to variations in

lobes and a pair of weak secondary lobes (wings), which are oriented with an
angle that gives the structure a cross-like shape. Though several theoretical
models have been proposed to explain their origin, there is currently not a
general consensus on a formation scenario. Aims. We analysed new multifrequency
Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) radio data at 1.5, 5.5, 6, and 9 GHz of
the candidate XRG in Abell 3670 (A3670) in order to characterise and classify
it for the first time and to investigate its origin. Methods. We produced flux,
spectral index, and radiative age maps of A3670 by means of the new radio data.
We investigated the connection between the radio galaxy and its host, a
brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) with two optical nuclei classified as a dumbbell
galaxy. Finally we discussed the literature models and compared them to the
observed properties of A3670. Results. We classify A3670 as a Fanaroff-Riley
I-type XRG and measured a 1.4 GHz radio power of 1.7 x 10^25 W Hz-1. By
estimating the radiative age of the various source components, we find that the
wings are 20 Myr older than the lobes. We verified that the lobes and wings are
aligned with the major and minor axes of the optical galaxy, respectively, and
we estimated a black hole mass of 10^9 Msun , which is in agreement with the
typical properties of the XRGs. Conclusions. Among the discussed scenarios, the
jet-shell interaction model may best reproduce the observed properties of
A3670. The gas of a stellar shell is responsible for the deflection of the
jets, thus forming the wings. The presence of stellar shells in A3670 is
plausible, but it needs further optical observations to be confirmed.

and a critical task in metrology. Generally, magnetic field has DC and AC
components and it is hard to extract both DC and AC components simultaneously.
The conventional Ramsey interferometry can easily measure DC magnetic fields,
while it becomes invalid for AC magnetic fields since the accumulated phases
may average to zero. Here, we propose a scheme for simultaneous measurement of
DC and AC magnetic fields by combining Ramsey interferometry and rapid periodic
pulses. In our scheme, the interrogation stage is divided into two signal
accumulation processes linked by a unitary operation. In the first process,
only DC component contributes to the accumulated phase. In the second process,
by applying multiple rapid periodic $\pi$ pulses, only the AC component gives
rise to the accumulated phase. By selecting suitable input state and the
unitary operations in interrogation and readout stages, and the DC and AC
components can be extracted by population measurements. In particular, if the
input state is a GHZ state and two interaction-based operations are applied
during the interferometry, the measurement precisions of DC and AC magnetic
fields can approach the Heisenberg limit simultaneously. Our scheme provides a
feasible way to achieve Heisenberg-limited simultaneous measurement of DC and
AC fields.

slow dense kilonova ejecta released from an earlier phase. Under the assumption
that such interaction accelerate cosmic rays to ultra-high energies, we
numerically simulate their propagation and interactions through the dynamical

produce isotropic high-energy neutrino fluxes, peaking at times $10^{3-4}\,$s,

observations of GW170817. In the second scenario, which we call optimistic,

vision and robotics. In this paper, we propose a new 2D CNN based network,
TrajectoryNet, to predict future poses in the trajectory space. Compared with
most existing methods, our model focuses on modeling the motion dynamics with
coupled spatio-temporal features, local-global spatial features and global
temporal co-occurrence features of the previous pose sequence. Specifically,
the coupled spatio-temporal features describe the spatial and temporal
structure information hidden in the natural human motion sequence, which can be
mined by covering the space and time dimensions of the input pose sequence with
the convolutional filters. The local-global spatial features that encode
different correlations of different joints of the human body (e.g. strong
correlations between joints of one limb, weak correlations between joints of
different limbs) are captured hierarchically by enlarging the receptive field
layer by layer and residual connections from the lower layers to the deeper
layers in our proposed convolutional network. And the global temporal
co-occurrence features represent the co-occurrence relationship that different
subsequences in a complex motion sequence are appeared simultaneously, which
can be obtained automatically with our proposed TrajectoryNet by reorganizing
the temporal information as the depth dimension of the input tensor. Finally,
future poses are approximated based on the captured motion dynamics features.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on three challenging benchmarks (e.g. Human3.6M, G3D, and FNTU),
which demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be
available if the paper is accepted.

life-cycles of massive stars. However, basic predictions of such mass loss
still suffer from significant quantitative uncertainties. Aims: We develop new
radiation-driven, steady-state wind models for massive stars with hot surfaces,
suitable for quantitative predictions of global parameters like mass-loss and
wind-momentum rates. Methods: The simulations presented here are based on a
self-consistent, iterative grid-solution to the spherically symmetric,
steady-state equation of motion, using full NLTE radiative transfer solutions
in the co-moving frame to derive the radiative acceleration. We do not rely on
any distribution functions or parametrization for computation of the line force
responsible for the wind driving. Results: In this first paper, we present
models representing two prototypical O-stars in the Galaxy, one with a higher
stellar mass M/Msun=59 and luminosity log10(L/Lsun)= 5.87 and one with a lower
M/Msun= 27 and log10(L/Lsun)= 5.1. For these simulations, basic predictions for
global mass-loss rates and velocity laws are given, and the influence from
additional parameters like wind clumping and microturbulent speeds discussed. A
key result is that our mass-loss rates are significantly lower than those
predicted by the mass-loss recipes normally included in models of massive-star
evolution. Conclusions: Our results support previous suggestions that Galactic
O-star mass-loss rates may be overestimated in present-day stellar evolution
models, and that new rates thus might be needed. Indeed, future papers in this
series will incorporate our new models into such simulations of stellar
evolution, extending the very first simulations presented here toward larger
grids covering a range of metallicities, B supergiants across the bistability
jump, and possibly also Wolf-Rayet stars.

applying MSD algorithm to eliminate as many noisy data to minimize the
interference on clusters, and (2) applying K-means algorithm to obtain local
optimal clusters. We evaluate our algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness
in the context of detecting possible overcharging of taxi fares, as greedy
dishonest drivers may attempt to charge high fares by detouring. We compare the
performance indicators of MSD-Kmeans with those of other outlier detection
algorithms, such as MSD, K-means, Z-score, MIQR and LOF, and prove that the

two-levels trade credit policy considering limited storage capacity whereby the
supplier provides a permissible delay period (M) to the retailer, and the
retailer also offers a permissible delay period (N) (whereM > N) to its
customers. In the current technical note, we point out some defects of their
model from the logical viewpoints of mathematics regarding both interest
charged and interest earned. Furthermore, as an example, one of the affected
numerical results is re-evaluated.

the validity of various theories related to observed heterogeneity in outcomes
such as growth, development, and trade.Though often easy to articulate, these
theories are imperfectly captured quantitatively. A number of different proxies
are often collected for a given theory and the uneven nature of this collection
requires care when employing model averaging. Furthermore, if valid, these
theories ought to be relevant outside of any single narrowly focused outcome
equation. We propose a methodology which treats theories as represented by
latent indices, these latent processes controlled by model averaging on the
proxy level. To achieve generalizability of the theory index our framework
assumes a collection of outcome equations. We accommodate a flexible set of
generalized additive models, enabling non-Gaussian outcomes to be included.
Furthermore, selection of relevant theories also occurs on the outcome level,
allowing for theories to be differentially valid. Our focus is on creating a
set of theory-based indices directed at understanding a country's potential
risk of macroeconomic collapse. These Sovereign Risk Indices are calibrated
across a set of different ""collapse"" criteria, including default on sovereign
debt, heightened potential for high unemployment or inflation and dramatic
swings in foreign exchange values. The goal of this exercise is to render a
portable set of country/year theory indices which can find more general use in
the research community.

the MBL can be regarded as an infinite-dimensional AL with the correlated
disorder in a virtual lattice. We demonstrate this idea using the disordered
XXZ model, in which the excitation of $d$ spins over the fully polarized phase
can be regarded as a single-particle model in a $d$ dimensional virtual
lattice. With the increasing of $d$, the system will quickly approach the MBL
phase, in which the infinite-range correlated disorder ensures the saturation
of the critical disorder strength in the thermodynamic limit. From the
transition from AL to MBL, the entanglement entropy and the critical exponent
from energy level statics are shown to depend weakly on the dimension,
indicating that belonging to the same universal class. This work clarifies the
fundamental concept of MBL and presents a new picture for understanding the MBL

steel has been investigated in the past [1][2]. It has been reported that
fracture initiates by void formation at inclusions and regions of enhanced
strain localisation [3]. There is experimental evidence that supports the fact
that hydrogen influences void nucleation, growth and coalescence during
material fracture [4]. This work investigates the effect of hydrogen on void
growth and coalescence in austenitic stainless steel. The effect of hydrogen on
void growth and coalescence for different stress triaxialities has been
examined by analysing the stress strain response of a single crystal
representative volume element (RVE). The results show that the higher the
stress triaxiality, the lower the equivalent stress required to yield. This
response is found to be similar irrespective of whether the material is being
exposed to hydrogen or not. Lower equivalent strain values to yield were
experienced for higher stress triaxialities for both hydrogen free and
hydrogenated samples. Hydrogen slowed down void growth at high stress
triaxialities but promoted void growth as lower triaxialities. For lower
triaxialities, the presence of hydrogen was found to initially inhibit void
growth at low equivalent strain values. However, this effect reversed at higher
equivalent strain values and hydrogen was found to promote void growth. The
effect of hydrogen promoting or inhibiting void growth have been shown to
increase in magnitude with increasing hydrogen concentration.

It turns out that to make things consistent, it seems useful to perform our

studying the universal properties and which are stable under the construction
of crossed products even for non-discrete groups. In the case of operator
systems, this larger category is what we call a $C^*$-operator system, i.e., a
selfadjoint subspace $X$ of some $\mathcal B(H)$ which contains a $C^*$-algebra
$A$ such that $AX=X=XA$. In the case of operator spaces, the larger category is
given by what we call $C^*$-operator bimodules. After we introduced the

In addition, the visual odometry will be greatly disturbed when a significant

eigenstates in the large-size limit, as expected for a true phase transition. A
``super-spin'' generalization allows us to find a further large class of
area-law states proved to display very slow relaxation. These states retain
memory of their initial conditions for extremely long times. Our numerical
analysis reveals that the localization properties are not limited to the ground
state and that} many eigenstates have large overlap with product states and can
be approximated well by matrix product states at arbitrary energy densities.
The mechanism that induces localization to the ground state, and hence the
non-thermal behavior of the system, can be extended to a wide range of models
including a number of simple spin chains. We discuss implications of our
results for slow thermalization and non-ergodicity more generally in
disorder-free systems with constraints and we give numerical evidence that
these results may be extended to two dimensional systems.

by the TGSS, and 43 of them are detected above a 5 sigma limit of 17.5 mJy. No
extended emission has been detected around the FR0s, corresponding to a
luminosity limit of < 4 10^23 W/Hz over an area of 100 kpc x 100 kpc. All but
eight FR0s have a flat or inverted spectral shape (alpha < 0.5) between 150 MHz
and 1.4 GHz: this spectral behavior confirms the general paucity of optically
thin extended emission within the TGSS beam, as is expected for their compact
1.4 GHz morphology.
  Data at 5 GHz were used to build their radio spectra, which are also
generally flat at higher frequencies. By focusing on a sub-sample of FR0s with
flux density > 50 mJy at 1.4 GHz, we found that ~75% of them have a convex
spectrum, but with a smaller curvature than the more powerful gigahertz
peaked-spectrum sources (GPS). The typical FR0s radio spectrum is better
described by a gradual steepening toward high frequencies, rather than to a
transition from an optically-thick to an optically-thin regime, possibly
observed in only ~15% of the sample.

deployment are advocating their usage in variety of applications. Some of them
are health monitoring, agriculture, environmental and habitant monitoring, and
water monitoring. These nodes are autonomous in nature. It follows that they
like to operate in a dynamic and adaptive network environment. So, the
communication mechanism between IoT nodes must be robust and adaptive with
respect to the environmental change. Unfortunately, the traditional networking
architecture supports limited and fixed network computations. These limitations
inhibit flexible and robust IoT nodes communication. In addition, the energy
consumption in communication nodes is high due to limited processing. To
address these issues, this paper gives rebirth to the active system. The
proposed active network framework brings a novel integration of the active
system with recent technologies (software-defined networking and network
function virtualization). As a result of integration, the active system runs as
a network function virtualization under the control of software-defined
networking. In our view, the amalgam of recent technologies with the active
system will promote a robust and flexible IoT nodes communication along with
reduced energy consumption. Moreover, various design benefits such as security,
flexibility, usability, cost, and performance will be added to the system.
Additionally, the proposed framework is open and generalized. It can be
extended to other networks such as mobile, satellite, and vehicular networks.

one-step, partial fusion and the two-step mechanism proceeding via the

full numerical scheme that uses Fermi's Golden Rule to extract the momentum
relaxation times of each state at every energy, momentum, and band. We consider
electron-phonon scattering (acoustic and optical), as well as ionized impurity
scattering, and evaluate the qualitative and quantitative differences in the
power factors of the materials compared to the case where the constant
scattering time is employed. We show that the thermoelectric power factors
extracted from the two different methods differ in terms of i) their ranking
between materials, ii) the carrier density where the peak power factor appears,
and iii) their trends with temperature. We further show that the constant
relaxation time approximation smoothens out the richness in the bandstructure
features, thus limiting the possibilities of exploring this richness for
material design and optimization. These details are more properly captured
under full energy/momentum-dependent scattering time considerations. Finally,
by mapping the conductivities extracted within the two schemes, we provide
appropriate density-dependent constant relaxation times that could be employed

particularly challenging because uranium rods have a very high cross section

at the center of the assembly is heavily attenuated. Furthermore, most photons
reaching the detector will have undergone Compton scattering, originating a
high background deprived of spatial information. In this paper, we describe our

tomography algorithms that have been routinely used for decades in nuclear
medicine. Attenuation correction is performed by subsequent approximations. An
intermediate reconstruction is used to detect missing pins. This information is
used to generate the final attenuation map, which is used to generate the image

comparing the counts in the different energy windows. Results of

exponential scaling shown to stem from the expansion of the wave function in
one-particle basis sets. It is demonstrated that using a geminal basis with a
skew-symmetric orthogonal coefficient matrix, which fulfill a Lie algebra, the
parameterization of the exact wave function becomes independent of the number
of particles and only scale quadratic with the number of basis functions in the
optimized basis and quartic in an arbitrary basis. The resulting
antisymmetrized geminal power wave function is shown to fulfill the necessary
and sufficient conditions for the exact wave function, treat all electrons and
electron pairs as indistinguishable and be the most compact representation of
the exact wave function possible. The number of parameters in the
antisymmetrized geminal power wave function is exactly the same number of
parameters as in the two-particle reduced density matrix thereby showing that
these representations are equivalent just like the representations for a
one-particle Hamiltonian. A detailed discussion of how the most compact wave
function can be derived in general is also presented along with different

period-spacing patterns in 611 $\gamma$\,Dor stars. Almost every star pulsates
in dipole g modes, while about 30\% of stars also show clear patterns for
quadrupole g modes and 16\% of stars present r mode patterns. We measure
periods, period spacings, and the gradient of the period spacings. These three
observables guide the mode identifications and can be used to estimate the
near-core rotation rate. We find many stars are hotter and show longer
period-spacing patterns than theory. Using the Traditional Approximation of
Rotation (TAR), we inferred the asymptotic spacings, the near-core rotation
rates, and the radial orders of the g and r modes. Most stars have a near-core
rotation rate around $1$\,$\mathrm{c/d}$ and an asymptotic spacing around
4000\,s. We also find that many stars rotate more slowly than predicted by

These bars provide a series of advantages over fully planar printed
technologies, including higher coupling levels between resonators, better
unloaded quality factors QU, and larger bandwidths, implemented with more
compact structures. Moreover, thick bar resonators can easily be coupled to an
additional resonance excited in a box used for shielding, allowing to realize
transversal topologies able to implement transmission zeros at desired
frequencies. To illustrate the capabilities of this technology, two microwave
filters with different bandwidths and one transmission zero have been designed.
One of the filters has been manufactured and tested using copper bars inside an
aluminum housing partially filled with Teflon. Measured data demonstrates a
fractional bandwidth about FBW = 32%, spurious free range SFR > 50%, unloaded
quality factor of QU = 1180 and return losses over 20 dB without requiring any

been shown to be feasible and to hold tremendous promise as a technology for
the development of next-generation, compact electron sources. Previous work has
concentrated on structures powered transversely by short, single-cycle THz
pulses, with mm-scale, segmented interaction regions that are ideal for
acceleration of electrons in the sub- to few-MeV range where electron
velocities vary significantly. However, in order to extend this technology to
the multi-MeV range, investigation of approaches supporting longer interaction
lengths is needed. Here, we demonstrate first steps in electron acceleration
and manipulation using dielectrically-lined waveguides powered by temporally
long, narrowband, multi-cycle THz pulses that co-propagate with the electrons.
This geometry offers centimeter-scale single-stage interaction lengths and
offers the opportunity to further increase interaction lengths by cascading
acceleration stages that recycle the THz energy and rephase the interaction. We
prove the feasibility of THz-energy recycling for the first time by
demonstrating acceleration, compression and focusing in two sequential
Al2O3-based dielectric capillary stages powered by the same multi-cycle THz
pulse. Since the multi-cycle energy achievable using laser-based sources is
currently a limiting factor for the maximum electron acceleration, THz energy
recycling provides a key enabling factor for reaching relativistic energies
with existing sources.

(100-150K) has been achieved in melt-spun n-type Bi85Sb15 bulk samples

than polycrystalline averaged single crystal ZT of ~0.4, and it is also
significantly higher than ZT of less than ~0.3 measured below 150K in Bi-Te
alloys commonly used for cryogenic cooling applications. The improved
thermoelectric properties can be attributed to the fine-grained microstructure
achieved from rapid solidification, which not only significantly reduced the
thermal conductivity but also mitigated a segregation effect. A record low
thermal conductivity of ~1.5 W m-1 K-1 near 100 K was measured using the hot
disk method. The thermoelectric properties for this intriguing
semimetal-semiconductor alloy system were analyzed within a two-band effective
mass model. The study revealed a gradual narrowing of the band gap at
increasing temperature in Bi-Sb alloy for the first time.
Magneto-thermoelectric effects of this Bi-Sb alloy further improved the TE
properties, leading to ZT of about 0.7. The magneto-TE effect was further
demonstrated in a combined NdFeB/BiSb/NdFeB system. The compactness of the

the case when one or more modes, represented by the potentials V_2, V_3,
\ldots, co-exist in the galactic disc in addition to the bar's mode V_{bar},
but rotate with pattern speeds \Omega_2, \Omega_3, \ldots incommensurable

(assuming that V_2,V_3... are small with respect to V_{bar}) we then show that
the unstable Lagrangian points L_1, L_2 of the pure bar model

when we have one extra pattern speed different from \Omega_{bar}, or as
epicyclic `Lissajous-like' unstable orbits, when we have more than one extra

their manifolds in a Milky-way like model with bar and spiral pattern speeds
assumed different. We find that the manifolds produce a time-varying morphology
consisting of segments of spirals or `pseudorings'. These structures are
repeated after a period equal to half the relative period of the imposed
spirals with respect to the bar. Along one period, the manifold-induced
time-varying structures are found to continuously support at least some part of
the imposed spirals, except at short intervals around those times at which the
relative phase of the imposed spirals with respect to the bar becomes equal to
\pm\pi/2. A connection of these effects to the phenomenon of recurrent spirals

functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique that has received
much attention due to its potential for combined high temporal and spatial
resolution. However, the ballistocardiogram (BCG), a large-amplitude artifact
caused by cardiac induced movement contaminates the EEG during EEG-fMRI
recordings. Removal of BCG in software has generally made use of linear
decompositions of the corrupted EEG. This is not ideal as the BCG signal is
non-stationary and propagates in a manner which is non-linearly dependent on
the electrocardiogram (ECG). In this paper, we present a novel method for BCG
artifact suppression using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Methods: EEG
signals were recovered by training RNNs on the nonlinear mappings between ECG
and the BCG corrupted EEG. We evaluated our model's performance against the
commonly used Optimal Basis Set (OBS) method at the level of individual
subjects, and investigated generalization across subjects. Results: We show
that our algorithm can generate larger average power reduction of the BCG at
critical frequencies, while simultaneously improving task relevant EEG based
classification. Conclusion: The presented deep learning architecture can be
used to reduce BCG related artifacts in EEG-fMRI recordings. Significance: We
present a deep learning approach that can be used to suppress the BCG artifact
in EEG-fMRI without the use of additional hardware. This method may have scope
to be combined with current hardware methods, operate in real-time and be used
for direct modeling of the BCG.

dynamo can be active in galaxies of this class despite their slow rotation
because their discs are relatively thick. Earlier assessments of the
possibility of the mean-field dynamo action in low-mass galaxies relied on
estimates applicable to $\textit{thin}$ discs, such as those in massive spiral
galaxies. Using both order-of-magnitude estimates and numerical solutions, we
show that the strength of differential rotation required to amplify magnetic
field reduces as the aspect ratio of the galactic gas layer increases. Thus,
the puzzle of the origin of large-scale magnetic fields appears to be solved.
As a result, this class of galaxies provides a new ground for testing our
understanding of galactic magnetism.

we demonstrate a unified phonon interpretation of non-Fourier heat conduction

nanoscale phonon transport characteristics including temperature profile, the
heat flux value and the modal temperature depend on the applied thermal
reservoirs on the two contacts. Our NEMD simulations demonstrate that Langevin
thermostat behaves like an infinitely large thermal reservoir and provides
thermally equilibrium mode-resolved phonon outlets, while biased reservoirs,
e.g., Nose-Hoover chain thermostat and velocity rescaling method behave like
non-equilibrium phonon outlets. Our interpretation clearly demonstrates that
the non-Fourier heat transport phenomena are originated from a combination of
non-diffusive phonon transport and phonon thermal nonequilibrium. This work
provides a clear understanding of nanoscale heat transport and may guide the

embedded system, it is critical for the CNN implementation to be highly energy
efficient. Many recent studies propose CNN accelerator architectures with
custom computation units that try to improve energy-efficiency and performance
of CNNs by minimizing data transfers from DRAM-based main memory. However, in
these architectures, DRAM is still responsible for half of the overall energy
consumption of the system, on average. A key factor of the high energy
consumption of DRAM is the refresh overhead, which is estimated to consume 40%
of the total DRAM energy. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism, Refresh
Triggered Computation (RTC), that exploits the memory access patterns of CNN
applications to reduce the number of refresh operations. We propose three RTC
designs (min-RTC, mid-RTC, and full-RTC), each of which requires a different
level of aggressiveness in terms of customization to the DRAM subsystem. All of
our designs have small overhead. Even the most aggressive RTC design (i.e.,
full-RTC) imposes an area overhead of only 0.18% in a 16 Gb DRAM chip and can
have less overhead for denser chips. Our experimental evaluation on six
well-known CNNs show that RTC reduces average DRAM energy consumption by 24.4%
and 61.3%, for the least aggressive and the most aggressive RTC
implementations, respectively. Besides CNNs, we also evaluate our RTC mechanism
on three workloads from other domains. We show that RTC saves 31.9% and 16.9%
DRAM energy for Face Recognition and Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural
Network (BCPNN), respectively. We believe RTC can be applied to other
applications whose memory access patterns remain predictable for a sufficiently

modern multicore CPUs. One of its implications is that optimization of an
application for performance will also optimize it for energy. In this work, we
show that energy proportionality does not hold true for multicore CPUs. This
finding creates the opportunity for bi-objective optimization of applications
for performance and energy. We propose and study the first application-level
method for bi-objective optimization of multithreaded data-parallel
applications for performance and energy. The method uses two decision
variables, the number of identical multithreaded kernels (threadgroups)
executing the application and the number of threads in each threadgroup, with
the workload always partitioned equally between the threadgroups. We
experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of the method using four highly
optimized multithreaded data-parallel applications, 2D fast Fourier transform
based on FFTW and Intel MKL, and dense matrix-matrix multiplication using
OpenBLAS and Intel MKL. Four modern multicore CPUs are used in the experiments.
The experiments show that optimization for performance alone results in the
increase in dynamic energy consumption by up to 89% and optimization for
dynamic energy alone degrades the performance by up to 49%. By solving the
bi-objective optimization problem, the method determines up to 11 globally
Pareto-optimal solutions. Finally, we propose a qualitative dynamic energy
model employing performance monitoring counters as parameters, which we use to
explain the discovered energy nonproportionality and the Pareto-optimal
solutions determined by our method. The model shows that the energy

computing technologies have been fabricated, by using scanning tunneling
microscopy and hydrogen resist lithography to position phosphorus atoms in
silicon with atomic-scale precision. Despite these successes, phosphine remains
the only donor precursor molecule to have been demonstrated as compatible with
the hydrogen resist lithography technique. The potential benefits of
atomic-scale placement of alternative dopant species have, until now, remained
unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate successful fabrication of atomic-scale
structures of arsenic-in-silicon. Using a scanning tunneling microscope tip, we
pattern a monolayer hydrogen mask to selectively place arsenic atoms on the
Si(001) surface using arsine as the precursor molecule. We fully elucidate the
surface chemistry and reaction pathways of arsine on Si(001), revealing
significant differences to phosphine. We explain how these differences result
in enhanced surface immobilization and in-plane confinement of arsenic compared
to phosphorus, and a dose-rate independent arsenic saturation density of
$0.24{\pm}0.04$ ML. We demonstrate the successful encapsulation of arsenic
delta-layers using silicon molecular beam epitaxy, and find electrical
characteristics that are competitive with equivalent structures fabricated with
phosphorus. Arsenic delta-layers are also found to offer improvement in
out-of-plane confinement compared to similarly prepared phosphorus layers,
while still retaining >80% carrier activation and sheet resistances of $<2
k{\Omega}/{\square}$. These excellent characteristics of arsenic represent
opportunities to enhance existing capabilities of atomic-scale fabrication of
dopant structures in silicon, and are particularly important for
three-dimensional devices, where vertical control of the position of device
components is critical.

expected to reduce noise on images, thanks to the additional information. In
clinical routine, a common reconstruction approach is the use of maximum
likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) stopped after few iterations.
Empirically it was reported that, at matched number of iterations, the
introduction of TOF increases noise. In this work we revise the theory
describing the signal and noise convergence in MLEM, and we adapt it to
describe the TOF impact on early stopped MLEM. We validated theoretical results
using both computer simulations and phantom measurements, performed on scanners
with different coincidence timing resolutions. This work provides theoretical
support for the empirically observed noise increase introduced by TOF.
Conversely, it shows that TOF not only improves signal convergence but also
makes it less dependent on the activity distribution in the field of view. We
then propose a strategy to determine stopping criteria for TOF-MLEM, which
reduces the number of iterations by a factor proportional to the coincidence
timing resolution. We prove that this criteria succeeds in markedly reducing
noise, while improving signal recovery robustness as it provides a level of
contrast recovery which is independent from the object dimension and from the
activity distribution of the background.

an isosurface of an averaged scalar, we find that for a slender flow,
$\overline V_g=\overline u_\zeta - \overline{D}h_t/\overline{D}t$, where
$\overline D/\overline D t$ is the material derivative of the average flowfield
and $\overline u_\zeta$ is the average velocity perpendicular to the flow
direction across the interface located at $\zeta=h_t$. The description is shown
to reproduce well-known results for the axisymmetric jet, the planar wake and
the temporal jet, and provides a clear link between the local (small-scale) and
global (integral) descriptions of turbulent entrainment. Application to
unsteady jets/plumes demonstrates that, under unsteady conditions, the
entrainment coefficient $\alpha$ no longer only captures entrainment of ambient
fluid, but also time-dependency effects due to the loss of self-similarity.

low-dimensional chaotic systems, the Lorenz equations and the

The primary question is to establish whether the sensitivity of period averaged
quantities with respect to parameter perturbations computed over long orbits
can be used as a sufficiently good proxy for the response of the chaotic state
to finite-amplitude parameter perturbations. To address this question, an
inventory of thousands of orbits at least two orders of magnitude longer than
the shortest admissible cycles is constructed. The expectation of period
averages, Floquet exponents and sensitivities over such set is then obtained.
It is shown that all these quantities converge to a limiting value as the orbit
period is increased. However, while period averages and Floquet exponents
appear to converge to analogous quantities computed from chaotic trajectories,
the limiting value of the sensitivity is not necessarily consistent with the
response of the chaotic state, similar to observations made with other
shadowing algorithms.

into low-dimensional vector spaces to support various applications such as KG
completion, question answering, and recommender systems. In real world,
knowledge graphs (KGs) are dynamic and evolve over time with addition or
deletion of triples. However, most existing models focus on embedding static
KGs while neglecting dynamics. To adapt to the changes in a KG, these models
need to be retrained on the whole KG with a high time cost. In this paper, to
tackle the aforementioned problem, we propose a new context-aware Dynamic
Knowledge Graph Embedding (DKGE) method which supports the embedding learning
in an online fashion. DKGE introduces two different representations (i.e.,
knowledge embedding and contextual element embedding) for each entity and each
relation, in the joint modeling of entities and relations as well as their
contexts, by employing two attentive graph convolutional networks, a gate
strategy, and translation operations. This effectively helps limit the impacts
of a KG update in certain regions, not in the entire graph, so that DKGE can
rapidly acquire the updated KG embedding by a proposed online learning
algorithm. Furthermore, DKGE can also learn KG embedding from scratch.
Experiments on the tasks of link prediction and question answering in a dynamic
environment demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DKGE.

preferable over the commonly used equidistant scheme. Furthermore, two
interpolation schemes for continuous-time survival estimates are explored, both

of LiDAR inputs simultaneously, which are subsequently inputted into our

self-ionisation of water. We use conservation laws to identify the conjugate
thermodynamic variables at chemical equilibrium. Using this thermodynamic
conjugate variables we perform a Legendre transform which defines the

how the phase behavior depends on pH by moving away from the isoelectric point.
We find that phase diagrams as a function of pH strongly depend on whether
oppositely charged macromolecules or neutral macromolecules have a stronger
tendency to phase separate. We predict the existence of reentrant behavior as a
function of pH. In addition, our model also predicts that the region of phase
separation is typically broader at the isoelectric point. This model could

  (WNGT 2019)",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models generally perform translation using a
fixed-size lexical vocabulary, which is an important bottleneck on their
generalization capability and overall translation quality. The standard
approach to overcome this limitation is to segment words into subword units,
typically using some external tools with arbitrary heuristics, resulting in
vocabulary units not optimized for the translation task. Recent studies have
shown that the same approach can be extended to perform NMT directly at the
level of characters, which can deliver translation accuracy on-par with
subword-based models, on the other hand, this requires relatively deeper
networks. In this paper, we propose a more computationally-efficient solution
for character-level NMT which implements a hierarchical decoding architecture
where translations are subsequently generated at the level of words and
characters. We evaluate different methods for open-vocabulary NMT in the
machine translation task from English into five languages with distinct
morphological typology, and show that the hierarchical decoding model can reach
higher translation accuracy than the subword-level NMT model using
significantly fewer parameters, while demonstrating better capacity in learning
longer-distance contextual and grammatical dependencies than the standard
character-level NMT model.

material, such as an antiferromagnetic system with a polar crystal structure.
According to symmetry considerations, while time-reversal and space-inversion
symmetries are both broken, there exist specific spin flipping operations that
relate opposite spin sites in the magnetic crystal structure. As a consequence,
at certain high-symmetry points in the momentum space, the magnetic point group
allows the spin angular momentum to be locked to the linear momentum, a typical
feature of the Rashba effect. In such a case, spin-splitting effects induced by
spin-orbit coupling can arise, similar to what happens in non-magnetic Rashba
systems. As a prototypical example, ab-initio calculations of antiferromagnetic
BiCoO3 in the polar structure reveal that a large Rashba-like band- and spin-
splitting occurs at the conduction band bottom, having a large weight from Bi-p
orbital states. Moreover, we show that the spin texture of such a multiferroic
can be modulated by applying a magnetic field. In particular, an external
in-plane magnetic field is predicted not only to induce spin-canting, but also
a distortion of the energy isocontours and a shift of the spin-vortex (centered
on the high-symmetry point and characteristic of Rashba effect) along a
direction perpendicular to the applied field.

two-dimensional graphene with a three-dimensional topological insulator (TI) in
van der Waals heterostructures to take advantage of their remarkable spintronic

these heterostructures, we experimentally demonstrate a gate tunable

Importantly, using a gate voltage, we reveal a strong electric field tunability
of both amplitude and sign of the spin-galvanic signal. These findings provide
an efficient route for realizing all-electrical and gate-tunable spin-orbit

algorithms are purely associative, identifying diseases that are strongly
correlated with a patients symptoms and medical history. We show that this
inability to disentangle correlation from causation can result in sub-optimal
or dangerous diagnoses. To overcome this, we reformulate diagnosis as a
counterfactual inference task and derive new counterfactual diagnostic
algorithms. We show that this approach is closer to the diagnostic reasoning of
clinicians and significantly improves the accuracy and safety of the resulting
diagnoses. We compare our counterfactual algorithm to the standard Bayesian
diagnostic algorithm and a cohort of 44 doctors using a test set of clinical
vignettes. While the Bayesian algorithm achieves an accuracy comparable to the
average doctor, placing in the top 48% of doctors in our cohort, our
counterfactual algorithm places in the top 25% of doctors, achieving expert
clinical accuracy. This improvement is achieved simply by changing how we query

rotation rates from 0 to 30 times the solar value, corresponding to Coriolis
numbers, Co, of 0 to 110. We measured the turbulent transport coefficients
describing the magnetic field evolution with the help of the test-field method,
and compared with the dynamo effect arising from the differential rotation. The
trace of the $\alpha$ tensor increases for moderate rotation rates with
Co$^{0.5}$ and levels off for rapid rotation. This behavior agrees with the
kinetic $\alpha$, if one considers the decrease of the convective scale with
increasing rotation. The $\alpha$ tensor becomes highly anisotropic for
Co$\gtrsim 1$. Furthermore, $\alpha_{rr}$ dominates for moderate rotation
(1<Co<10), and $\alpha_{\phi\phi}$ for rapid rotation (Co $\gtrsim 10$). The
turbulent pumping effect is dominating the meridional transport of the magnetic
field. Taking all dynamo effects into account, we find three distinct regimes.
For slow rotation, the $\alpha$ and R\""adler effects are dominating in the
presence of anti-solar differential rotation. For moderate rotation, $\alpha$
and $\Omega$ effects are dominant, indicative of $\alpha\Omega$ or
$\alpha^2\Omega$ dynamos in operation, producing equatorward-migrating dynamo
waves with a qualitatively solar-like rotation profile. For rapid rotation, an
$\alpha^2$ mechanism, with an influence from the R\""adler effect appears to be
the most probable driver of the dynamo. Our study reveals the presence of a
large variety of dynamo effects beyond the classical $\alpha\Omega$ mechanism.

of obliquity tides. Using an adaptation of the Modules for Experiments in
Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) stellar evolution toolkit, we model the atmospheric
evolution of sub-Neptune-mass planets in response to additional internal heat
from obliquity tides. The degree of radius inflation predicted by the models is
$\sim10\%-100\%$ for tidal luminosities $\gtrsim 10^{-5}$ of the incident
stellar power; this degree of inflation is broadly consistent with the
observations and can approximately be described by power law relationships. We
present a few case studies of very low density ""super-puff"" planets --
Kepler-79 d, Kepler-31 c, and Kepler-27 b -- and show that they are strong
candidates for potentially having undergone tidally-induced radius inflation.
We also discuss how the discrepancy between the two populations of planets with
masses derived from radial velocities and transit timing variations is
connected to the radius distribution features we have identified. Altogether,
the calculations in this work confirm that tidal dissipation has non-negligible
consequences for the structural properties of short-period sub-Neptunes.

quantum gravity theories and considering the consistency of what lives on the
branes, one is able to understand whether such theories can belong either to
the swampland or to the landscape. In this regard, in the present work, we
study a warm inflation model embedded in the Randall-Sundrum braneworld
scenario. It is explicitly shown that this model belongs to the landscape by
supporting a strong dissipative regime with an inflaton steep exponential
potential. The presence of extra dimension effects from the braneworld allow
achieving this strong dissipative regime, which is shown to be both
theoretically and observationally consistent. In fact, such strong dissipation
effects, which decrease towards the end of inflation, together with the extra
dimension effect, allow the present realization to simultaneously satisfy all
previous restrictions imposed on such a model and to evade the recently
proposed swampland conjectures. The present implementation of this model, in
terms of an exponential potential for the scalar field, makes it also a
possible candidate for describing the late-time Universe in the context of a
dissipative quintessential inflation model and we discuss this possibility in
the Conclusions.

emitters of single photons when pumped resonantly. Often, the same spatial mode
is used to both resonantly excite a quantum dot and to collect the emitted
single photons, requiring cross-polarization to reduce the uncoupled scattered
laser light. This inherently reduces the source brightness to 50 %. Critically,
for some quantum applications the total efficiency from generation to detection
must be over 50 %. Here, we demonstrate a resonant-excitation approach to
creating single photons that is free of any cross-polarization, and in fact any
filtering whatsoever. It potentially increases single-photon rates and
collection efficiencies, and simplifies operation. This integrated device
allows us to resonantly excite single quantum-dot states in several cavities in
the plane of the device using connected waveguides, while the cavity-enhanced
single-photon fluorescence is directed vertical (off-chip) in a Gaussian mode.
We expect this design to be a prototype for larger chip-scale quantum

to predict convolutional kernels conditioned on the semantic label map to

learning methods. This is achieved with the help of an autoencoder architecture
with two different types of operational layers in the latent-space: a fully
connected multi-layer perceptron and convolutional long short-term memory
layers. A wall-resolved large eddy simulation of a turbulent channel flow at a
high Reynolds number is performed to create a large database of instantaneous
snapshots of turbulent flow-fields used to train neural networks. The training
is performed with sequences of instantaneous snapshots so as to learn a
snapshot at the next time instant. For the present work, velocity and pressure
fluctuations are used for training to produce the same parameters at the next
time instant. Within the autoencoders, different types of methods like average
pooling and strided convolutions are tested for the reduction of spatial
dimensions. For convolutional neural networks, the physical boundary conditions
are implemented in the form of symmetric as well as periodic paddings. A priori
simulations are performed with the trained deep learning models to check the
accuracy of turbulence statistics produced. It is found that the use of
convolutional long short-term memory layers in the latent space improved the
quality of statistics, although issues related to stability for longer times
are observed. Though instantaneous snapshots of the target flow are required
for training, these a priori simulations suggest that the deep learning methods
for generating inflow turbulence are one of the possible alternatives to
existing methods.

applied to realistic fluid models, we elucidate how the character of these
transitions depends sensitively on both the range of fluid-fluid and
substrate-fluid interactions and the temperature. Our calculations uncover
previously unrecognised classes of surface phase diagram which differ from that
established for simple lattice models and often assumed to be universal. The
differences relate both to the topology of the phase diagram and to the nature
of the transitions, with a remarkable feature being a difference between drying
and wetting transitions which persists even in the approach to the bulk
critical point. Most experimental and simulational studies of liquids at a
substrate belong to one of these previously unrecognised classes. We predict
that while there appears to be nothing particularly special about water with
regard to its wetting and drying behavior, superhydrophobic behavior should be
more readily observable in experiments conducted at high temperatures than at

number of hypergeometric E-functions with rational parameters. The case of
E-functions of differential order less than 2 was settled in the affirmative by
Gorelov in 2004, but Siegel's question is open for higher order. We prove here

representations that are both discriminative, for distinguishing
similar-looking people, and generalisable, for deployment across datasets
without any adaptation. In this paper, we develop novel CNN architectures to
address both challenges. First, we present a re-ID CNN termed omni-scale
network (OSNet) to learn features that not only capture different spatial
scales but also encapsulate a synergistic combination of multiple scales,
namely omni-scale features. The basic building block consists of multiple
convolutional streams, each detecting features at a certain scale. For
omni-scale feature learning, a unified aggregation gate is introduced to
dynamically fuse multi-scale features with channel-wise weights. OSNet is
lightweight as its building blocks comprise factorised convolutions. Second, to
improve generalisable feature learning, we introduce instance normalisation
(IN) layers into OSNet to cope with cross-dataset discrepancies. Further, to
determine the optimal placements of these IN layers in the architecture, we
formulate an efficient differentiable architecture search algorithm. Extensive
experiments show that, in the conventional same-dataset setting, OSNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance, despite being much smaller than existing re-ID
models. In the more challenging yet practical cross-dataset setting, OSNet
beats most recent unsupervised domain adaptation methods without using any
target data. Our code and models are released at

transition to QCD in the pure gluon sector at finite temperature within the

has been explained by adopting magnetic symmetry to extract magnetic monopoles
in a gauge invariant way and produce magnetic condensation of S U(3) dual QCD
vacuum which guarantees the dual Meissner effect. The deconfinement phase
transition has been described by constructing the effective potential at finite
temperature in the imaginary time formalism. The magnetic monopole condensate
acts as an order parameter for both the confinement deconfinement phase and has
been observed to be associated with the appearance/disappearance of magnetic
monopole condensate. The evidence of the confinement deconfinement phase
transition is further confirmed by the appearance/disappearance of the dual
Meissner effect and the existence/breaking of flux tube with temperature. The
gauge-invariant vector and scalar glueball masses at finite temperature have
been obtained from the minimization of the effective potential at finite

transition associated with the restoration of magnetic symmetry.

irregular parallel loops or tasks that exhibit stochastic characteristics.
Applications may suffer from load imbalance during their execution on
high-performance computing (HPC) systems due to such characteristics. Dynamic
loop self-scheduling (DLS) techniques are instrumental in improving the
performance of scientific applications on HPC systems via load balancing.
Selecting a DLS technique that results in the best performance for different
problems and system sizes requires a large number of exploratory experiments. A
theoretical model that can be used to predict the scheduling technique that
yields the best performance for a given problem and system has not yet been
identified. Therefore, simulation is the most appropriate approach for
conducting such exploratory experiments with reasonable costs. This work
devises an approach to realistically simulate computationally-intensive
scientific applications that employ DLS and execute on HPC systems. Several
approaches to represent the application tasks (or loop iterations) are compared
to establish their influence on the simulative application performance. A novel
simulation strategy is introduced, which transforms a native application code
into a simulative code. The native and simulative performance of two
computationally-intensive scientific applications are compared to evaluate the
realism of the proposed simulation approach. The comparison of the performance
characteristics extracted from the native and simulative performance shows that
the proposed simulation approach fully captured most of the performance
characteristics of interest. This work shows and establishes the importance of
simulations that realistically predict the performance of DLS techniques for

$N$ grows unbounded, the proposed scheme with ${m=c(t,d)K(t\log (\frac{\ell
N}{c(t,d)K}+1)+1)}$ tests can identify all the defective items with probability
approaching $1$, where $d$ and $\ell$ are the maximum and average left degree,
respectively, and $c(t,d)$ depends only on $t$ and $d$ (and does not depend on
$K$ and $N$). For any $t\leq 4$, the testing and recovery algorithms of the
proposed scheme have the computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N\log
\frac{N}{K})$ and $\mathcal{O}(K\log \frac{N}{K})$, respectively. The proposed
scheme outperforms two recently proposed non-adaptive QGT schemes for the
sub-linear regime, including our scheme based on regular bipartite graphs and
the scheme of Gebhard et al., in terms of the number of tests required to
identify all defective items with high probability.

propose a new greedy algorithm for the $\ell_0$-sparse PCA problem which

enabling factor for their great performance has been the ability to train very

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer an alternative that allows for

encouraging results, they are currently limited to architectures with a
relatively small number of layers, primarily due to vanishing gradients during
training. This work transfers concepts such as residual/dense connections and
dilated convolutions from CNNs to GCNs in order to successfully train very deep
GCNs. We show the benefit of using deep GCNs (with as many as 112 layers)

promising performance in part segmentation and semantic segmentation on point

S, and Se. The geometries of various APNRs were optimized, and the stability
was checked by calculating their formation energies. Using the relaxed
geometries, calculations of their band structure and optical properties were
performed. Pristine APNRs, as expected, exhibit significant edge
reconstruction, rendering them indirect band gap semiconductors, except for one
width {\normalsize{}($N=5$, where $N$ is the width parameter)} for which a
direct band gap is observed. The edge passivated APNRs are found to be direct
band gap semiconductors, with the band gap at the $\Gamma$-point, for all the
functional groups considered in this work. To obtain accurate estimates of band
gaps, calculations were also performed using HSE06 hybrid functional for
several APNRs. Our calculations reveal that functional groups have significant
influence on the band gaps and optical properties of narrower APNRs. For wider
passivated ribbons, with the increasing ribbon widths, the gaps converge to
almost the same value, irrespective of the group. We also performed
calculations including the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for hydrogen passivated
APNRs with $N=5$ and 11. We found that SOC has no significant influence on the
band structure of the studied APNRs. However, for the broader APNR, a lowering

have not considered any types of uncertainty associated with the class
probabilities to minimize risk due to misclassification under uncertainty in
real life. Unlike Bayesian neural nets indirectly infering uncertainty through
weight uncertainties, evidential neural networks (ENNs) have been recently
proposed to support explicit modeling of the uncertainty of class
probabilities. It treats predictions of an NN as subjective opinions and learns
the function by collecting the evidence leading to these opinions by a
deterministic NN from data. However, an ENN is trained as a black box without
explicitly considering different types of inherent data uncertainty, such as
vacuity (uncertainty due to a lack of evidence) or dissonance (uncertainty due
to conflicting evidence). This paper presents a new approach, called a {\em
regularized ENN}, that learns an ENN based on regularizations related to
different characteristics of inherent data uncertainty. Via the experiments

life-time of de Sitter spacetimes. It has immediate consequences for
inflationary cosmology. In the standard paradigm, the universe has experienced
a single stage of inflation and follows a thermal history. Then, the TCC puts
an upper bound on the Hubble parameter during inflation $H_{\rm inf}$ around
$0.1$ GeV. Consequently, it implies a severe fine-tuning in initial condition
for inflation and non-detection of primordial gravitational waves. In this
note, we study non-standard cosmological paradigms with non-thermal history
and/or multiple stages of inflations. It is motivated by string theory
compactifications and axiverse scenarios in which the modulus/axion fields are
effective in the early universe. In early matter domination the TCC bound on
$H_{\rm inf}$ can be raised up to 3 orders of magnitude. In multiple
inflationary scenarios the upper bound on the observable inflation can be
raised up $10^{14}$ GeV to touch the Planck 2018 bound.

boundary conditions (TBC) that can detect all the 2D fragile phases implied by
symmetry eigenvalues in all wallpaper groups. We develop the concept of real

while the available tools focus on the detection of the most similar

an electromagnetic probe are key input information in the theoretical modelling
of nuclear reactions. Consequently they are important for a wide range of
fields such as nuclear structure, nuclear astrophysics, medical isotope
production, fission and fusion reactor technologies. They are also sources of
information for widely used reaction libraries such as the IAEA Reference Input
Parameter Library and evaluated data files such as EGAF.
  In the past two decades, the amount of reaction gamma-ray data measured to
determine photon strength functions has grown rapidly. Different experimental
techniques have led to discrepant results and users are faced with the dilemma
which (if any) of the divergent data to adopt.
  We report on a coordinated effort to compile and assess the existing
experimental data on photon strength functions from the giant dipole resonance
region to energies below the neutron separation energy. The assessment of the
discrepant data at energies around or below the neutron separation energy has
been possible only in a few cases where adequate information on the
model-dependent analysis and estimation of uncertainties was available. In the
giant dipole resonance region, we adopt the recommendations of the new IAEA
photonuclear data library. We also present global empirical and
semi-microscopic models that describe the photon strength functions in the
entire energy region and reproduce reasonably well most of the experimental
data.
  The compiled experimental photon strengths and recommended model calculations
are available from the PSF database hosted at the IAEA

denote it by sB(L). The construction of strict broken symmetries also allows us
to incorporate twistings. Applying suitable U(r)-equivariant (twisted)
cohomology theories E to sB(L) gives rise to a spectral sequence of link
invariants converging to the cohomology of the limiting value of the

the first example, we study a universal twist of Borel-equivariant singular

heavily depend on profound experts who have knowledge in aerodynamics,
thermodynamics and meteorology. As precipitation can be influenced by countless
factors, however, the performances of these expert-driven methods can drop
drastically when some un-modeled factors change. To address this issue, this
paper presents a data-driven deep learning model which mainly includes two

the best of our knowledge, it is the first expert-free models for bias

scenario, the space-time metric excitation triggers an explosive inverse
cascade followed by the formation of a condensate in Fourier space whose growth
is interpreted as an expansion of the universe. Contrary to the idea that
gravitation can only produce a decelerating expansion, our study reveals that
gravitational wave turbulence could be a source of inflation. The fossil
spectrum that emerges from this scenario is shown to be in agreement with the
cosmic microwave background radiation measured by the Planck mission.

domain (non-labelled data) by leveraging the knowledge from source domain (rich
labelled data) which comes from a different but related distribution. Assuming
the source and target domains data(e.g. images) come from a joint distribution
but follow on different marginal distributions, the domain adaptation work aims
to infer the joint distribution from the source and target domain to learn the
domain invariant features. Therefore, in this study, I extend the existing
state-of-the-art approach to solve the domain adaptation problem. In
particular, I propose a new approach to infer the joint distribution of images
from different distributions, namely Wasserstein Distance Guided Cross-Domain
Learning (WDGCDL). WDGCDL applies the Wasserstein distance to estimate the
divergence between the source and target distribution which provides good
gradient property and promising generalisation bound. Moreover, to tackle the
training difficulty of the proposed framework, I propose two different training
schemes for stable training. Qualitative results show that this new approach is
superior to the existing state-of-the-art methods in the standard domain

recent progress, we lack a complete understanding of the non-equilibrium
dynamics of vesicles due to challenges associated with long-time observation of
shape fluctuations in strong flows. In this work, we present a flow-phase
diagram for vesicle shape and conformational transitions in planar extensional
flow using a Stokes trap, which enables control over the center-of-mass
position of single or multiple vesicles in precisely defined flows [Shenoy,
Rao, Schroeder, \textit{PNAS}, 113(15):3976-3981, 2016]. In this way, we
directly observe the non-equilibrium conformations of lipid vesicles as a
function of reduced volume $\nu$, capillary number $Ca$, and viscosity contrast
$\lambda$. Our results show that vesicle dynamics in extensional flow are
characterized by the emergence of three distinct shape transitions, including a
tubular to symmetric dumbbell transition, a spheroid to asymmetric dumbbell
transition, and quasi-spherical to ellipsoid transition. The experimental phase
diagram is in good agreement with recent predictions from simulations
[Narsimhan, Spann, Shaqfeh, \textit{J. Fluid Mech.}, 2014, \textbf{750}, 144].
We further show that the phase boundary of vesicle shape transitions is
independent of the viscosity contrast. Taken together, our results demonstrate
the utility of the Stokes trap for the precise quantification of vesicle
stretching dynamics in precisely defined flows.

detection applications, such as fluorescence spectroscopy, remote sensing and

quantum communications. However, the adverse conditions in space, such as the
increased radiation flux and thermal vacuum, severely limit their noise
performances, reliability, and lifetime. Herein, we present the first example
of spaceborne, low-noise, high reliability SPDs, based on commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) silicon avalanche photodiodes (APD). Based on the high
noise-radiation sensitivity of silicon APD, we have developed special shielding
structures, multistage cooling technologies, and configurable driver
electronics that significantly improved the COTS APD reliability and mitigated
the SPD noise-radiation sensitivity. This led to a reduction of the expected
in-orbit radiation-induced dark count rate (DCR) from ~219 counts per second
(cps) per day to ~0.76 cps/day. During a continuous period of continuous
operations in orbit which spanned of 1029 days, the SPD DCR was maintained
below 1000 cps, i.e., the actual in-orbit radiation-induced DCR increment rate
was ~0.54 cps/day, i.e., two orders of magnitude lower than those evoked by
previous technologies, while its photon detection efficiency was > 45%. Our
spaceborne, low-noise SPDs established a feasible satellite-based up-link
quantum communication that was validated on the quantum experiment science
satellite platform. Moreover, our SPDs open new windows of opportunities for
space research and applications in deep-space optical communications,
single-photon laser ranging, as well as for testing the fundamental principles
of physics in space.

systems where timely information updates are of importance. In the literature,
minimizing ""average age"" has received considerable attention. However, various
applications pose stricter age requirements on the updates which demand
knowledge of the AoI distribution. Furthermore, the analysis of AoI
distribution in a multi-hop setting, which is important for the study of
Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCS), has not been addressed before.
Toward this end, we study the distribution of AoI in a WNCS with two hops and
devise a problem of minimizing the tail of the AoI distribution with respect to
the frequency of generating information updates, i.e., the sampling rate of
monitoring a process, under first-come-first-serve (FCFS) queuing discipline.
We argue that computing an exact expression for the AoI distribution may not
always be feasible; therefore, we opt for computing upper bounds on the tail of
the AoI distribution. Using these upper bounds we formulate Upper Bound
Minimization Problems (UBMP), namely, Chernoff-UBMP and alpha-relaxed Upper
BoundMinimization Problem (alpha-UBMP), where alpha > 1 is an approximation
factor, and solve them to obtain ""good"" heuristic rate solutions. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by solving the proposed UBMPs for
three service distributions: geometric, exponential, and Erlang. Simulation
results show that the rate solutions obtained are near-optimal for minimizing
the tail of the AoI distribution for the considered distributions.

We demonstrate the computational efficiency and numerical stability of the
proposed method. We compare the proposed models to the previously developed
methods for scale equivariance and local scale invariance. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art results on MNIST-scale dataset and on STL-10 dataset in the

  Single Network","filed as a patent",,,,"cs.CV cs.HC cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automatic facial behavior analysis has a long history of studies in the
intersection of computer vision, physiology and psychology. However it is only
recently, with the collection of large-scale datasets and powerful machine
learning methods such as deep neural networks, that automatic facial behavior
analysis started to thrive. Three of its iconic tasks are automatic recognition
of basic expressions (e.g. happy, sad, surprised), estimation of continuous
emotions (e.g., valence and arousal), and detection of facial action units
(activations of e.g. upper/inner eyebrows, nose wrinkles). Up until now these
tasks have been mostly studied independently collecting a dataset for the task.
We present the first and the largest study of all facial behaviour tasks
learned jointly in a single multi-task, multi-domain and multi-label network,
which we call FaceBehaviorNet. For this we utilize all publicly available
datasets in the community (around 5M images) that study facial behaviour tasks
in-the-wild. We demonstrate that training jointly an end-to-end network for all
tasks has consistently better performance than training each of the single-task
networks. Furthermore, we propose two simple strategies for coupling the tasks
during training, co-annotation and distribution matching, and show the
advantages of this approach. Finally we show that FaceBehaviorNet has learned
features that encapsulate all aspects of facial behaviour, and can be
successfully applied to perform tasks (compound emotion recognition) beyond the
ones that it has been trained in a zero- and few-shot learning setting.

  Educational Data Mining",,,,"cs.CY cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Elo rating system has been recognised as an effective method for
modelling students and items within adaptive educational systems. The existing
Elo-based models have the limiting assumption that items are only tagged with a
single concept and are mainly studied in the context of adaptive testing
systems. In this paper, we introduce a multivariate Elo-based learner model
that is suitable for the domains where learning items can be tagged with
multiple concepts, and investigate its fit in the context of adaptive learning.
To evaluate the model, we first compare the predictive performance of the
proposed model against the standard Elo-based model using synthetic and public
data sets. Our results from this study indicate that our proposed model has
superior predictive performance compared to the standard Elo-based model, but
the difference is rather small. We then investigate the fit of the proposed
multivariate Elo-based model by integrating it into an adaptive learning system
which incorporates the principles of open learner models (OLMs). The results
from this study suggest that the availability of additional parameters derived
from multivariate Elo-based models have two further advantages: guiding
adaptive behaviour for the system and providing additional insight for students
and instructors.

these physical processes are governed in the simplest cases by partial
differential equations of order 1 and 2 in time, respectively. By replacing the
time derivatives in the above standard equations with pseudo-differential
operators interpreted as derivatives of non integer order (nowadays misnamed as
of fractional order) we are lead to generalized processes of diffusion that may
be interpreted as slow diffusion and interpolating between diffusion and wave
propagation. In mathematical physics we may refer these interpolating processes
to as fractional diffusion-wave phenomena. In this work we analyze and simulate
both the situations in which the input function is a Dirac delta generalized
function and a box function, restricting ourselves to the Cauchy problem. In
the firsrst case we get the fundamental solutions (or Green functions) of the
problem whereas in the latter case the solutions are obtained by a space
convolution of the Green function with the input function. In order to clarify
the matter for the non-specialist readers, we briefly recall the basic and
essential notions of the fractional calculus (the mathematical theory that
regards the integration and differentiation of noninteger order) with a look at
the history of this discipline.

disinformation? (ii) What are the most popular mechanisms to spread online
disinformation? and (iii) Which are the mechanisms that are currently being
used to fight against disinformation?. In all these three questions we take
first a general approach, considering studies from different areas such as
journalism and communications, sociology, philosophy, information and political
sciences. And comparing those studies with the current situation on the
Wikipedia ecosystem. We conclude that in order to keep Wikipedia as free as
possible from disinformation, it is necessary to help patrollers to early
detect disinformation and assess the credibility of external sources. More
research is needed to develop tools that use state-of-the-art machine learning
techniques to detect potentially dangerous content, empowering patrollers to
deal with attacks that are becoming more complex and sophisticated.

planet with an atmosphere can sustain liquid water on its surface. However,
despite the usefulness of this concept, it is being found to be increasingly
limiting in a number of ways. The following is known: (i) Liquid water can
exist on worlds for reasons unrelated to its specific distance from a star.
(ii) Energy sources can exist for reasons unrelated to the distance to a star.
Furthermore, the habitable zone is based on both astronomy: the distance and
stellar energy, and chemistry: liquid water and the right temperature. However,
these factors are only part of the consideration. Thus, discussions of
habitability and the possibility for the emergence of life on a world must
consider the evolutionary principles that govern life as well as the laws that
govern stellar and planetary science. This is important because the following
is also known: (iii) The time window for the emergence of life is within 600
million years. (iv) The Earth was an extreme environment overall in the period
when this window existed. (v) The first life was necessarily fragile.
Therefore, chemical evolution must have taken place in a relatively protected
and restricted environment. Thus, rather than as in the Goldilocks zone, which
focuses too narrowly on the world as a whole, this paper suggests that it is
better to focus on a particular region and time period on a world, in which
fitting conditions for habitability exist. Thus, the following is suggested:
The Goldilocks Edge is a spatial and temporal window on an astronomical body or
planemo, where liquid solvents, SPONCH elements, and energy sources exist.
Furthermore, since the mere presence of these do not in themselves necessarily
lead to the emergence of life, this possibility only arises when these
interact. Thus, the prebiotic spot will be suggested.

warehousing. For this purpose, an adaptive semi-stream join algorithm called
CACHEJOIN (Cache Join) focusing non-uniform stream data is provided in the
literature. However, this algorithm cannot exploit the memory and CPU resources
optimally and consequently it leaves its service rate suboptimal due to
sequential execution of both of its phases, called stream-probing (SP) phase
and disk-probing (DP) phase. By integrating the advantages of CACHEJOIN, in
this paper we present two modifications in it. First is called P-CACHEJOIN
(Parallel Cache Join) that enables the parallel processing of two phases in
CACHEJOIN. This increases number of joined stream records and therefore
improves throughput considerably. Second is called OP-CACHEJOIN (Optimized
Parallel Cache Join) that implements a parallel loading of stored data into
memory while the DP phase is executing. We present the performance analysis of
both of our approaches with existing CACHEJOIN empirically using synthetic
skewed dataset.

goals and user needs within cost, resource, and expected quality constraints
require design trade-offs. These trade-offs dictate how systems are structured
and how they behave and consequently can effectively be evolved and sustained.
Software engineering practices address this challenge by centering system
design and evolution around delivering key quality attributes, such as
security, privacy, data centricity, sustainability, and explainability. These
concerns are more urgent requirements for software-reliant systems that also
include AI components due to the uncertainty introduced by data elements.
Moreover, systems employed by the public sector exhibit unique design time and
runtime challenges due to the regulatory nature of the domains. We assert that
the quality attributes of security, privacy, data centricity, sustainability,
and explainability pose new challenges to AI engineering and will drive the
success of AI-enabled systems in the public sector. In this position paper, we
enumerate with examples from healthcare domain concerns related to these
requirements to mitigate barriers to architecting and fielding AI-enabled
