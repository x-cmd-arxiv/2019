overlooked, one that is diffusive only in an ensemble sense. Each realization
of the ensemble possesses dramatic ray limit structure that guides the waves

as surveillance, exploration, and cooperative construction. However, few
results consider decentralized heading control when the speed of heading
adjustment is restricted. In this paper, we propose a simple hybrid-dynamical
model based on pulse-coupled oscillators for decentralized heading control in
mobile robots while accounting for the constraint on the rate of heading
change. The pulse-coupled oscillator model is effective in coordinating the
phase of oscillator networks and hence is promising for robotic heading
coordination given that both phase and heading evolve on the same
one-dimensional torus. However, existing pulse-coupled oscillator results
require the phase adjustment to be instantaneous, which cannot hold for robot
heading adjustment due to physical limitations. We propose a generalization to
the standard pulse-coupled oscillator model to allow for the phase to adjust at
a finite rate, yet still have the oscillator network converge to the desired
state, making our approach applicable to robotic heading coordination under
rate constraints. We provide rigorous mathematical proof for the achievement of
both synchronized and desynchronized heading relationships, and experimentally
verify the results using extensive tests on a multi-robot platform.

this paper, new investigations of the composition of Ganymede's surface at
global scale are presented. The analyses are derived from the linear spectral
modeling of a high spectral resolution dataset, acquired with the near-infrared
ground-based integral field spectrometer SINFONI of the VLT. We find that the
Oren-Nayar (1994) model, generalizing the Lambert's law for rough surfaces,
produces excellent photometric corrections. Modeling confirms that Ganymede's
surface composition is dominated by H2O-ice, mostly crystalline, as well as a
darkening agent, but it also highlights the necessity of secondary species to
better fit the measurements: sulfuric acid hydrate and salts. A latitudinal
gradient and a hemispherical dichotomy are the strongest spatial patterns
observed for the darkening agent, the H2O-ice, and the sulfuric acid: the
darkening agent is the major compound at the equator and mid-latitudes,
especially on the trailing hemisphere, while the H2O-ice and the sulfuric acid
are mostly located at high latitudes and on the leading hemisphere. This
anti-correlation is likely a consequence of the bombardment of the constituents
in the Jovian magnetosphere which are more intense at higher latitudes.
Furthermore, the modeling confirms that polar caps are enriched in small,
fresh, H2O-ice grains while equatorial regions are composed of larger grains.
Finally, the spatial distribution of the salts is neither related to the Jovian
magnetospheric bombardment nor the craters. These species are mostly detected
on bright grooved terrains surrounding darker areas. Endogenous processes, such
as freezing of upwelling fluids in the ice shell, may explain this
distribution.

individual examiners' interpretation of the evidence. Each source

context of a canonical social interactions model, we provide sufficient
conditions under which the social interactions matrix, endogenous and exogenous
social effect parameters are all globally identified. While this result is
relevant across different estimation strategies, we then describe how
high-dimensional estimation techniques can be used to estimate the interactions
model based on the Adaptive Elastic Net GMM method. We employ the method to
study tax competition across US states. We find the identified social
interactions matrix implies tax competition differs markedly from the common
assumption of competition between geographically neighboring states, providing
further insights for the long-standing debate on the relative roles of factor
mobility and yardstick competition in driving tax setting behavior across
states. Most broadly, our identification and application show the analysis of
social interactions can be extended to economic realms where no network data

phenomenon may be due to Batch Normalization or BN, which is ubiquitous and
provides benefits in optimization and generalization across all standard
architectures. The following new results are shown about BN with weight decay
and momentum (in other words, the typical use case which was not considered in
earlier theoretical analyses of stand-alone BN.
  1. Training can be done using SGD with momentum and an exponentially
increasing learning rate schedule, i.e., learning rate increases by some $(1
+\alpha)$ factor in every epoch for some $\alpha >0$. (Precise statement in the
paper.) To the best of our knowledge this is the first time such a rate
schedule has been successfully used, let alone for highly successful
architectures. As expected, such training rapidly blows up network weights, but
the net stays well-behaved due to normalization.
  2. Mathematical explanation of the success of the above rate schedule: a
rigorous proof that it is equivalent to the standard setting of BN + SGD +
StandardRate Tuning + Weight Decay + Momentum. This equivalence holds for other
normalization layers as well, Group Normalization, LayerNormalization, Instance
Norm, etc.

techniques, that allow us to compute, in the limit of large system size, also
the subleading corrections to the microcanonical entropy. These subleading
terms are crucial ingredients to account for the first-order mechanism of the
transition, to compute its order parameter and to predict the existence of
negative temperatures in the localized phase. All of these features can be
viewed as signatures of a thermodynamic phase where the translational symmetry
is broken spontaneously due to a condensation mechanism yielding energy
fluctuations far away from equipartition: actually they prefer to participate
in the formation of nonlinear localized excitations (breathers), typically
containing a macroscopic fraction of the total energy.

polarimetry is a useful technique to gather astronomical information from
spatially extended phenomena. There are two enigmatic celestial objects that
can also effectively be studied with imaging polarimetry, namely the
Kordylewski dust clouds (KDCs) positioned around the L4 and L5 triangular
Lagrangian libration points of the Earth-Moon system. Although in 1961 the
Polish astronomer, Kazimierz Kordylewski had observed two bright patches near
the L5 point with photography, many astronomers assume that these dust clouds
do not exist, because the gravitational perturbation of the Sun, solar wind and
other planets may disrupt the stabilizing effect of the L4 and L5 Lagrange
points of the Earth and Moon. Using ground-born imaging polarimetry, we present
here new observational evidence for the existence of the KDC around the L5
point of the Earth-Moon system. Excluding artefacts induced by the telescope,
cirrus clouds or condensation trails of airplanes, the only explanation remains
the polarized scattering of sunlight on the particles collected around the L5
point. By our polarimetric detection of the KDC we think it is appropriate to
reconsider the pioneering photometric observation of Kordylewski. Our
polarimetric evidence is supported by the results of simulation of dust cloud

traffic flow, where connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven
vehicles (HDVs) coexist. Compared with pure CAVs, the major challenge is how to
handle the prediction uncertainty of HDVs, which can cause significant state
deviation of CAVs from planned trajectories. In most existing studies, model
predictive control (MPC) is utilized to replan CAVs' trajectories to mitigate
the deviation at each time step. However, as the replan process is usually
conducted by solving an optimization problem with information through
inter-vehicular communication, MPC methods suffer from heavy computational and
communicational burdens. To address this limitation, a robust platoon control
framework is proposed based on tube MPC in this paper. The prediction
uncertainty is dynamically mitigated by the feedback control and restricted
inside a set with a high probability. When the uncertainty exceeds the set or
additional external disturbance emerges, the feedforward control is triggered
to plan a ``tube'' (a sequence of the set), which can bound CAVs' actual
trajectories. As the replan process is usually not required, the proposed
method is much more efficient regarding computation and communication, compared
with the MPC method. Comprehensive simulations are provided to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework.

We present a method to add source context that capture the whole document with
accurate boundaries, taking every word into account. We provide this additional
information to a Transformer model and study the impact of our method on three
language pairs. The proposed approach obtains promising results in the
English-German, English-French and French-English document-level translation

of the Poincar\'e group, whose homogeneous part generates curvature while the
translational sector gives rise to torsion. In this note we revisit the
stability of the widely studied quadratic theories within this framework. We
analyse the presence of ghosts without fixing any background by obtaining the
relevant interactions in an exact post-Riemannian expansion. We find that the
axial sector of the theory exhibits ghostly couplings to the graviton sector
that render the theory unstable. Remarkably, imposing the absence of these
pathological couplings results in a theory where either the axial sector or the
torsion trace becomes a ghost. We conclude that imposing ghost-freedom
generically leads to a non-dynamical torsion. We analyse however two special
choices of parameters that allow a dynamical scalar in the torsion and obtain
the corresponding effective action where the dynamics of the scalar is
apparent. These special cases are shown to be equivalent to a generalised
Brans-Dicke theory and a Holst Lagrangian with a dynamical Barbero-Immirzi
pseudoscalar field respectively. The two sectors can co-exist giving a
bi-scalar theory. Finally, we discuss how the ghost nature of the vector sector
can be avoided by including additional dimension four operators.

rises. We propose a simple approach to estimate pressure-volume relations and
show that this characteristic softening pattern is widely observed in metallic

linear regression on ab initio calculated energies and forces and leads to
effective two- and three-body potential, reproducing quantum many-body
interactions as accurately as possible. Our potential can be made continuously
differentiable any number of times at the expense of increased computational
time. We made a number of performance tests on one-, two- and three-component
systems. The flexibility of the introduced approach makes the potential
transferable in terms of size and type of atomic systems. We show that trained
on randomly generated structures with just 8 atoms in the unit cell, it
significantly outperforms common empirical interatomic potentials in the study
of large systems, such as grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials.

have the potential to radically change the way humans interact with machines.
However, even with the progress in the abilities of these agents, there remain
critical gaps in their capacity for natural interactions. One limitation is
that the agents are often monotonic in behavior and do not adapt to their
partner. We built two end-to-end conversational agents: a voice-based agent
that can engage in naturalistic, multi-turn dialogue and align with the
interlocutor's conversational style, and a 2nd, expressive, embodied
conversational agent (ECA) that can recognize human behavior during open-ended
conversations and automatically align its responses to the visual and
conversational style of the other party. The embodied conversational agent
leverages multimodal inputs to produce rich and perceptually valid vocal and
facial responses (e.g., lip syncing and expressions) during the conversation.
Based on empirical results from a set of user studies, we highlight several
significant challenges in building such systems and provide design guidelines
for multi-turn dialogue interactions using style adaptation for future
research.

the ultimate theory of fundamental interactions as it has inumerous unsolved
problems, so it must be extended. Deciphering the nature of dark matter remains
one of the great challenges of contemporary physics. Supersymmetry is probably
the most attractive extension of the SM. In the first part of this thesis we
study the interparticle potentials generated by the interactions between
spin-1/2 sources that are mediated by spin-1 particles in the limit of low
momentum transfer. We investigate different representations of spin-1 particle
to see how it modifies the profiles of the interparticle potentials and we also
include in our analysis all types of couplings between fermionic currents and
the mediator boson. The spin- and velocity-dependent interparticle potentials
that we obtain can be used to explain effects possibly associated to new
macroscopic forces such as modifications of the inverse-square law and possible
spin-gravity coupling effects. The second part of this thesis is based on the
dark matter phenomenology of well-motivated $U(1)'$ extensions of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model. In these models the right-handed sneutrino is a
good DM candidate whose dark matter properties are in agreement with the
present relic density and current experimental limits on the DM-nucleon
scattering cross section. In order to see how heavy can the RH sneutrino be as
a viable thermal dark matter candidate we explore its DM properties in the
parameter region that minimize its relic density via resonance effects and thus
allows it to be a heavier DM particle. We found that the RH sneutrino can
behave as a good DM particle within minimal cosmology even with masses of the
order of tens of TeV, which is much above the masses that viable thermal DM
candidates usually have in most of dark matter particle models.

We find that both the east and west limb often form clouds, but that the
different properties of these clouds enhances the limb to limb differences
compared to the clear case. Using JWST it should be possible to detect the
presence of cloud inhomogeneities by comparing the shape of the transit
lightcurve at multiple wavelengths because inhomogeneous clouds impart a
characteristic, wavelength dependent signature. This method is statistically
robust even with limited wavelength coverage, uncertainty on limb darkening
coefficients, and imprecise transit times. We predict that the short wavelength
slope varies strongly with temperature. The hot limb of the hottest planets
form higher altitude clouds composed of smaller particles leading to a strong
rayleigh slope. The near infrared spectral features of clouds are almost always
detectable, even when no spectral slope is visible in the optical. In some of
our models a spectral window between 5 and 9 microns can be used to probe
through the clouds and detect chemical spectral features. Our cloud particle
size distributions are not log-normal and differ from species to species. Using
the area or mass weighted particle size significantly alters the relative
strength of the cloud spectral features compared to using the predicted size
distribution. Finally, the cloud content of a given planet is sensitive to a
species' desorption energy and contact angle, two parameters that could be
constrained experimentally in the future.

challenging topics in astrophysics. Diffusion due to scattering by
electromagnetic fluctuations is a key process in cosmic-ray transport. The
transition from a ballistic to a diffusive-propagation regime is presented in
direct numerical calculations of diffusion coefficients for homogeneous
magnetic field lines subject to turbulent perturbations. Simulation results are
compared with theoretical derivations of the parallel diffusion coefficient's
dependencies on the energy and the fluctuation amplitudes in the limit of weak
turbulence. The present study shows that the widely-used extrapolation of the
energy scaling for the parallel diffusion coefficient to high turbulence levels
predicted by quasi-linear theory does not provide a universally accurate
description in the resonant-scattering regime. It is highlighted here that the
numerically calculated diffusion coefficients can be polluted for low energies
due to missing resonant interaction possibilities of the particles with the
turbulence. Five reduced-rigidity regimes are established, which are separated
by analytical boundaries derived in the present work. Consequently, a proper
description of cosmic-ray propagation can only be achieved by using a
turbulence-level-dependent diffusion coefficient and can contribute to solving
the Galactic cosmic-ray gradient problem.

divided into explosions of CO WDs accreting material from stellar
non-degenerate companions (single-degenerate; SD models), and those arising

However, current models for the progenitors of such SNe fail to reproduce the
diverse properties of the observed explosions, nor do they explain the inferred
rates and the characteristics of the observed populations of type Ia SNe and
their expected progenitors. Here we show that the little-studied mergers of
CO-WDs with hybrid Helium-CO (He-CO) WDs can provide for a significant fraction
of the normal type Ia SNe. Here we use detailed thermonuclear-hydrodynamical
and radiative-transfer models to show that a wide range of mergers of CO WDs
with hybrid He-CO WDs can give rise to normal type Ia SNe. We find that such
He-enriched mergers give rise to explosions for which the synthetic

particular, they can produce a wide range of peak-luminosities, MB(MR)~ 18.4 to

around peak light, where it is applicable. By analytic arguments and numerical
studies of toy models, Khatami & Kasen (2019) recently argued for a new
approximate relation between peak bolometric Luminosity, $L_p$, and the time of
peak since explosion, $t_p$, for transients involving homologous expansion:
$L_p=2/(\beta t_p)^2\int_0 ^{\beta t_{p}} t'Q(t')dt'$, where $Q(t)$ is the
heating rate of the ejecta, and $\beta$ is an order unity parameter that is
calibrated from numerical calculations. Khatami & Kasen (2019) demonstrated its
validity using Monte-Carlo radiation transfer simulations of ejecta with
homogenous density and (for most cases considered) constant opacity.
Interestingly, constant values of $\beta$ accurately reproduce the numerical
calculations for different heating distributions and over a wide range of
energy release times. Here we show that the diffusion and the adiabatic loss of
energy in homologous expansion is equivalent to a static diffusion equation and
provide an analytic solution for the case of uniform density and opacity
(extending the results of Pinto & Eastman 2000). Our accurate analytical
solutions reproduce and extend the results of Khatami & Kasen (2019) for this
case, allowing clarification for the universality of their peak time-luminosity
relation as well as new limitations to its use.

substructures in the nearby halo, such as the $Gaia$ Sausage or Sequoia. The
stream identified by Helmi et al. is recovered, but the two disjoint portions
of the substructure have distinct dynamical properties. The very retrograde

6 new DTGs with highly retrograde orbits, 2 with very prograde orbits, and 12
with polar orbits. By mapping other datasets (APOGEE halo stars, and catalogs
of r-process-enhanced and CEMP stars) onto the trained neuron map, we can
associate stars with detailed chemical abundances to the DTGs, and look for
associations with chemically peculiar stars. The highly eccentric $Gaia$
Sausage groups contain representatives both of debris from the satellite itself
(which is $\alpha$-poor) and the Splashed Disk, sent up into eccentric halo
orbits from the encounter (and is $\alpha$-rich). The new prograde
substructures also appear to be associated with the Splashed Disk. The DTGs
belonging to the $Gaia$ Sausage host two relatively metal-rich $r$-II stars and
six CEMP stars in different sub-classes, consistent with the idea that the
$Gaia$ Sausage progenitor is a massive dwarf galaxy. Rg5 is dynamically
associated with two highly $r$-process-enhanced stars with [Fe/H] $\sim -$3.

faster outflows eject metals to larger distances, yielding more metal-rich DLAs

$R$-symmetric $SU(5)$ grand unified theory (GUT). To avoid the monopole
problem, a pseudosmooth inflationary trajectory is generated with the help of
an additional $Z_5$ symmetry which is broken during and after inflation. The
predictions of inflationary parameters are made at the central value of the
scalar spectral index, $n_s =0.968$. The largest possible value of the tensor
to scalar ratio, $r\lesssim 0.0027$, is obtained with sub-Planckian field
values ($\lesssim m_P$). A successful realization of reheating and leptogenesis
is achieved by avoiding the gravitino problem with a reheat temperature as low
as $10^6$ GeV. The predicted range of the gauge symmetry breaking scale, $ 5

be somewhat larger than the typical GUT scale. With additional vector-like
families, a successful gauge coupling unification is achieved by avoiding the
no-go theorem related to $R$-symmetric $SU(5)$ GUT.

black holes already at z~ 7.5. An appealing and promising pathway to their
formation is the direct collapse scenario of a primordial gas in atomic-cooling
haloes at z ~ 10 - 20, when the $\rm H_2$ formation is inhibited by a strong
background radiation field, whose intensity exceeds a critical value, $J_{\rm
crit}$. To estimate $J_{\rm crit}$, typically, studies have assumed idealized
spectra, with a fixed ratio of $\rm H_{2}$ photo-dissociation rate $k_{\rm
H_2}$ to the $\rm H^-$ photo-detachment rate $k_{\rm H^-}$. This assumption,
however, could be too narrow in scope as the nature of the background radiation
field is not known precisely. In this work we argue that the critical condition
for suppressing the $\rm H_2$ cooling in the collapsing gas could be described
in a more general way by a combination of $k_{\rm H_2}$ and $k_{\rm H^-}$
parameters. By performing a series of cosmological zoom-in simulations with an
encompassing set of $k_{\rm H_2}$ and $k_{\rm H^-}$, we examine the gas flow by
following evolution of basic parameters of the accretion flow. We test under
what conditions the gas evolution is dominated by $\rm H_{2}$ and/or atomic
cooling. We confirm the existence of a critical curve in the $k_{\rm
H_2}-k_{\rm H^-}$ plane, and provide an analytical fit to it. This curve
depends on the conditions in the direct collapse, and reveals domains where the
atomic cooling dominates over the molecular cooling. Furthermore, we have
considered the effect of $\rm H_{2}$ self-shielding on the critical curve, by
adopting three methods for the effective column density approximation in $\rm
H_{2}$. We find that the estimate of the characteristic length-scale for
shielding can be improved by using $\lambda_{\rm Jeans25}$, which is 0.25 times
that of the local Jeans length.

two orders of magnitude energy savings; a single-port RAM-based number

with the Sapphire cryptographic core occupying 0.28 mm2 area consisting of 106k

of an intimately related decision problem SCMP -- does there exist a measure
with a non-mass-splitting transport cost and support size below prescribed

from planar 3-dimensional matching and follows a strategy laid out by Spieksma

3-dimensional matching. While we closely mirror the actual steps of their
proof, the arguments themselves differ fundamentally due to the complex nature
of the discrete barycenter problem. Containment of SCMP in NP will remain open.
We prove that, for a given measure, sparsity and cost of an optimal transport
to a set of measures can be verified in polynomial time in the size of a bit
encoding of the measure. However, the encoding size of a barycenter may be
exponential in the encoding size of the underlying measures.

atomic strain due to modulation of the fine structure constant and the lepton
mass at the Compton frequency of dark matter particles. The resulting stress
can drive an elastic body with acoustic breathing modes, producing
displacements that are accessible with opto- or electromechanical readout
techniques. To address the unknown mass of dark matter particles (which
determines their Compton frequency), we consider various resonator designs
operating at kHz to MHz frequencies, corresponding to $10^{-12}-10^{-5}$ eV
particle mass. Current resonant-mass gravitational wave detectors that have
been repurposed as dark matter detectors weigh $\sim \! 10^3$ kg. We find that
a large unexplored parameter space can be accessed with ultra-high-$Q$,

our gravitational action contains the Einstein-Hilbert term without introducing
any additional (compensator) scalar field to satisfy the local scale

optimization and uncertainty quantification, where repeated evaluations of an
expensive simulator are required. For most partial differential equation (PDE)
simulators, the outputs of interest are often spatial or spatial-temporal
fields, leading to very high-dimensional outputs. Despite the success of
existing data-driven surrogates for high-dimensional outputs, most methods
require a significant number of samples to cover the response surface in order
to achieve a reasonable degree of accuracy. This demand makes the idea of
surrogate models less attractive considering the high computational cost to
generate the data. To address this issue, we exploit the multi-fidelity nature
of a PDE simulator and introduce deep coregionalization, a Bayesian
non-parametric autoregressive framework for efficient emulation of
spatial-temporal fields. To effectively extract the output correlations in the
context of multi-fidelity data, we develop a novel dimension reduction
technique, residual principal component analysis. Our model can simultaneously
capture the rich output correlations and the fidelity correlations and make
high-fidelity predictions with only a few expensive, high-fidelity simulation
samples. We show the advantages of our model in three canonical PDE models and
a fluid dynamics problem. The results show that the proposed method cannot only
approximate a simulator with significantly less cost (at bout 10%-25%) but also
further improve model accuracy.

methodology for working with such datasets, there is a valid concern that
analyses will produce noise artifacts rather than true effects. In this paper,
we offer a way to enable researchers to systematically build models and
identify novel phenomena in large datasets. One traditional approach is to
analyze the residuals of models---the biggest errors they make in predicting
the data---to discover what might be missing from those models. However, once a
dataset is sufficiently large, machine learning algorithms approximate the true
underlying function better than the data, suggesting instead that the
predictions of these data-driven models should be used to guide model-building.
We call this approach ""Scientific Regret Minimization"" (SRM) as it focuses on
minimizing errors for cases that we know should have been predictable. We
demonstrate this methodology on a subset of the Moral Machine dataset, a public
collection of roughly forty million moral decisions. Using SRM, we found that
incorporating a set of deontological principles that capture dimensions along
which groups of agents can vary (e.g. sex and age) improves a computational
model of human moral judgment. Furthermore, we were able to identify and
independently validate three interesting moral phenomena: criminal
dehumanization, age of responsibility, and asymmetric notions of
responsibility.

proposed in the last decade, for example, symbolic automata or lattice
automata. Applications of these types of automata include software security
analysis and natural language processing. While these models provide means to
describe words over infinite input alphabets, there is no considerable work on
symbolic output (as present in transducers) alphabets, or even abstraction
(widening) thereof. Furthermore, established approaches for transforming, for
example, minimizing or reducing, finite-state machines that produce output on
states or transitions are not applicable. A notion of equivalence of this type
of machines is needed to make statements about whether or not transformations
maintain the semantics. We present abstract transducers as a new form of
finite-state transducers. Both their input alphabet and the output alphabet is
composed of abstract words, where one abstract word represents a set of
concrete words. The mapping between these representations is described by
abstract word domains. By using words instead of single letters, abstract
transducers provide the possibility of lookaheads to decide on state
transitions to conduct. Since both the input symbol and the output symbol on
each transition is an abstract entity, abstraction techniques can be applied
naturally. We apply abstract transducers as the foundation for sharing task
artifacts for reuse in context of program analysis and verification, and
describe task artifacts as abstract words. A task artifact is any entity that
contributes to an analysis task and its solution, for example, candidate
invariants or source code to weave.

the nanoindentation response is primarily controlled by the indented-grain's
crystalline orientation and dislocation density. However, the indentation
properties, such as hardness, have ambiguous significance at the nanoscale due

introduces the notion of a ""dual pair of Lie subalgebras"" - a pair
$(\mathfrak{g}_1, \mathfrak{g}_2)$ of reductive Lie subalgebras of a Lie
algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ such that $\mathfrak{g}_1$ and $\mathfrak{g}_2$ are each
other's centralizers in $\mathfrak{g}$. This notion has a natural analog for
algebraic groups; namely, a ""dual pair of subgroups"" is a pair $(G_1, G_2)$ of
reductive subgroups of an algebraic group $G$ such that $G_1$ and $G_2$ are
each other's centralizers in $G$. We present substantial progress towards
classifying the dual pairs of the complex classical groups ($GL(n,\mathbb{C})$,
$SL(n,\mathbb{C})$, $Sp(2n,\mathbb{C})$, $O(n,\mathbb{C})$, and
$SO(n,\mathbb{C})$) and their projective counterparts ($PGL(n,\mathbb{C})$,
$PSp(2n,\mathbb{C})$, $PO(n,\mathbb{C})$, $PSO(n,\mathbb{C})$). The
classifications of dual pairs in $Sp(2n,\mathbb{C})$, $GL(n,\mathbb{C})$, and
$O(n,\mathbb{C})$ are known, but lack a unified explicit treatment; we provide
such a treatment. Additionally, we classify the dual pairs in
$SL(n,\mathbb{C})$ and $SO(n,\mathbb{C})$, and present partial progress towards
classifying the dual pairs in $PGL(n,\mathbb{C})$, $PSp(2n,\mathbb{C})$, and
$PO(n,\mathbb{C})$.

pollutant detection. Nowadays, a combination of mass spectrometry and
chromatographic techniques are the most basic environmental monitoring methods.
In this paper, two organochlorine compound mass spectra classification systems
were proposed. The classification models were developed within the framework of
artificial neural networks (ANNs) and fast 1D and 2D molecular descriptor
calculations. Based on the intensities of two characteristic MS peaks, namely,
[M] and [M-35], two classification criterions were proposed. According to
criterion I, class 1 comprises [M] signals with the intensity higher than 800
NIST units, while class 2 consists of signals with the intensity lower or equal
than 800. According to criterion II, class 1 consists of [M-35] signals with
the intensity higher than 100, while signals with the intensity lower or equal
than 100 belong to class 2. As a result of ANNs learning stage, five models for
both classification criterions were generated. The external model validation
showed that all ANNs are characterized by high predicting power; however,
criterion I-based ANNs are much more accurate and therefore are more suitable
for analytical purposes. In order to obtain another confirmation, selected ANNs
were tested against additional dataset comprising popular sunscreen agents
disinfection by-products reported in previous works.

incomplete. While the favoured scenario is delayed revival of the stalled shock
by neutrino heating, it is difficult to reliably compute explosion outcomes and
energies, which depend sensitively on the complex radiation hydrodynamics of
the post-shock region. The dynamics of the (non-)explosion depend sensitively
on how energy is transported from inside and near the proto-neutron star (PNS)
to material just behind the supernova shock. Although most of the PNS energy is
lost in the form of neutrinos, hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic waves can also
carry energy from the PNS to the shock. We show that gravity waves excited by
core PNS convection can couple with outgoing acoustic waves that present an
appreciable source of energy and pressure in the post-shock region. Using
one-dimensional simulations, we estimate the gravity wave energy flux excited
by PNS convection and the fraction of this energy transmitted upward to the
post-shock region as acoustic waves. We find wave energy fluxes near
$10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ are likely to persist for
$\sim1\,\mathrm{s}$ post-bounce. The wave pressure on the shock may exceed
$10\%$ of the thermal pressure, potentially contributing to shock revival and,
subsequently, a successful and energetic explosion. We also discuss how future
simulations can better capture the effects of waves, and more accurately

Whether this type of robustness holds or not for impulsive systems was still an
open question. By means of suitable (counter)examples, we show that such
stability robustness with respect to the inclusion of inputs cannot hold in
general, not even for impulsive systems with time-invariant flow and jump maps.
In particular, we show that zero-input global uniform asymptotic stability
(0-GUAS) does not imply converging input converging state (CICS), and that
0-GUAS and uniform bounded-energy input bounded state (UBEBS) do not imply
integral input-to-state stability (iISS). We also comment on available existing

  IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, Paris, France, July 2019",,,,"cs.IT cs.IR math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the role of coded side information in single-server Private
Information Retrieval (PIR). An instance of the single-server PIR problem
includes a server that stores a database of $K$ independently and uniformly
distributed messages, and a user who wants to retrieve one of these messages
from the server. We consider settings in which the user initially has access to
a coded side information which includes a linear combination of a subset of $M$
messages in the database. We assume that the identities of the $M$ messages
that form the support set of the coded side information as well as the coding
coefficients are initially unknown to the server. We consider two different
models, depending on whether the support set of the coded side information
includes the requested message or not. We also consider the following two
privacy requirements: (i) the identities of both the demand and the support set
of the coded side information need to be protected, or (ii) only the identity
of the demand needs to be protected. For each model and for each of the privacy
requirements, we consider the problem of designing a protocol for generating
the user's query and the server's answer that enables the user to decode the
message they need while satisfying the privacy requirement. We characterize the
(scalar-linear) capacity of each setting, defined as the ratio of the number of
information bits in a message to the minimum number of information bits
downloaded from the server over all (scalar-linear) protocols that satisfy the
privacy condition. Our converse proofs rely on new information-theoretic
arguments---tailored to the setting of single-server PIR and different from the
commonly-used techniques in multi-server PIR settings. We also present novel
capacity-achieving scalar-linear protocols for each of the settings being
considered.

propose an alternate approach: instead of not being able to infer whether an

separate roles for each agent. Because each role defines a distinct reason for
acting (e.g., only exploit, only communicate), teammates now correctly
interpret the meaning behind their partner's actions. Our results suggest that
leveraging and alternating roles leads to performance comparable to teams that

edge-connectivity SNDP (EC-SNDP), element-connectivity SNDP (Elem-SNDP) and
vertex-connectivity SNDP (VC-SNDP) depending on whether the paths are required
to be edge, element or vertex disjoint respectively. Our main result is an
$O(k)$-approximation algorithm for EC-SNDP and Elem-SNDP when the input graph
is planar or more generally if it belongs to a proper minor-closed family of

improves upon the $O(k \log n)$-approximation known for node-weighted EC-SNDP

a black-box fashion to obtain a logarithmic factor improvement over currently

to address the aforementioned issues. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical
ramp merging system that not only generates microscopic cooperative maneuvers
for CAVs on the ramp to merge into the mainline traffic flow, but also provides
controllability of the ramp inflow rate, thereby enabling macroscopic traffic
flow control. A centralized optimal control-based approach is proposed to
smooth the merging flow, improve the system-wide mobility, and decrease the
overall fuel consumption of the network. Linear quadratic trackers in both
finite horizon and receding horizon forms are developed to solve the
optimization problem in terms of path planning and sequence determination,
where a microscopic vehicle fuel consumption model is applied. Extensive
traffic simulation runs have been conducted using PTV VISSIM to evaluate the
impact of the proposed system on a segment of SR-91 E in Corona, California.
The results confirm that under the regulated inflow rate, the proposed system
can avoid potential traffic congestion and improve mobility (e.g., VMT/VHT) up
to 147%, with a 47% fuel savings compared to the conventional ramp metering and
the ramp without any control approach.

symmetric and baroclinic instabilities, spawns vortex filaments of O(100) m
thickness as well as larger eddies, and develops turbulence that is spatially
localized and organized. A O(100) m physical-space filter is applied to the
simulated flow to separate the coherent submesoscale from the finescale in a
decomposition that preserves their spatial organization unlike the typical
practice of along-front averaging. Analysis of the submesoscale vertical
velocity (as large as 5 mm/s) reveals that downwelling is limited to the thin
vortex filaments while upwelling occurs over spatially extensive regions in the
eddies, resulting in an overall buoyancy flux that is restratifying. The
kinetic energy (KE) transport equations are evaluated separately at both the
scales to understand energy pathways in this problem. The buoyancy flux
associated with coherent motions acts as the primary source of submesoscale KE
which is then transported across the front with a fraction transferred to the
finescale. The transfer, limited to thin regions of O(100) m horizontal width,
is accomplished by primarily horizontal strain in the upper 10 m and by
vertical shear in the rest of the 50 m deep mixed layer. Frontogenetic
mechanisms are diagnosed through analysis of the transport equation for squared

counteracted primarily by horizontal diffusion in the top 10 m and by the

maximal distance minimizer problem, id est of sets having the minimal length
(one-dimensional Hausdorff measure) over the class of closed connected sets
$\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ satisfying the inequality $\max_{y \in M}
dist(y,\Sigma) \leq r$ for a given compact set $M \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ and
some given $r > 0$. Such sets can be considered as the shortest networks of
radiating cables arriving to each customer (from the set $M$ of customers) at a
distance at most $r$. In this work it is proved that each maximal distance
minimizer is a union of finite number of simple curves, having one-sided
tangents at each point. Moreover the angle between these rays at each point of
a maximal distance minimizer is greater or equal to $2\pi/3$. It shows that a
maximal distance minimizer is isotopic to a finite Steiner tree even for a
""bad"" compact $M$, which differs it from a solution of the Steiner problem
(there exists an example of a Steiner tree with an infinite number of branching
points). Also we classify the behavior of a minimizer in a neighbourhood of an
arbitrary point of $\Sigma$. In fact, all the results are proved for more
general class of local minimizer, id est sets which are optimal in a

novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework, called Collaborative Feature
Ensembling Adaptation (CFEA), to effectively overcome this challenge. Our
proposed CFEA is an interactive paradigm which presents an exquisite of
collaborative adaptation through both adversarial learning and ensembling
weights. In particular, we simultaneously achieve domain-invariance and
maintain an exponential moving average of the historical predictions, which
achieves a better prediction for the unlabeled data, via ensembling weights
during training. Without annotating any sample from the target domain, multiple
adversarial losses in encoder and decoder layers guide the extraction of
domain-invariant features to confuse the domain classifier and meanwhile
benefit the ensembling of smoothing weights. Comprehensive experimental results
demonstrate that our CFEA model can overcome performance degradation and
outperform the state-of-the-art methods in segmenting retinal optic disc and

probe different aspects of the many-body dynamics, and thus provide
complementary information. These are well studied in the low- and
high-temperature limits, while the experimentally important intermediate
regime, in which elastic and inelastic scattering are both important, is less
understood. To fill this gap, we provide comprehensive solutions of the
Boltzmann equation in the presence of an electric field and a temperature
gradient for two different cases: First, when electron-electron collisions are
treated within the relaxation-time approximation while the full momentum
dependence of electron-impurity scattering is included and, second, when the
electron-impurity scattering is momentum-independent, but the electron-electron
collisions give rise to a momentum-dependent inelastic scattering rate of the
Fermi-liquid type. We find that for Fermi-liquid as well as for Coulomb
interactions, both methods give the same results for the leading temperature
dependence of the transport coefficients. Moreover, the inelastic relaxation
rate enters the electric conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient only when the
momentum dependence of the electron-impurity collisions, analytical or
non-analytical, is included. Specifically, we show that inelastic processes
only mildly affect the electric conductivity, but can generate a non-monotonic
dependence of the Seebeck coefficient on temperature and even a change of sign.
Thermal conductivity, by contrast, always depends on the inelastic scattering
rate even for a constant elastic relaxation rate.

expenses to stay relevant in the market due to the increase in software
complexity. This need for change resulted in the introduction of edge
computing. Edge computing distributes the computational strain between the
server and the devices. This contribution allows the cloud to accommodate more

amounts of processing power to execute. For example, sound classification comes
with massive computational needs due to its affiliation with neural networks
and deep learning. This paper aims to create a feasible and deployable
real-time sound classification system. There were three configurations tested

edge computing alone cannot cater to a technological market that is
exponentially growing in size and complexity. However, the same results show

consider two frameworks. The first is using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD),
and the second is based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). For ANN, we
utilized a residual deep neural network, and for DMD we have studied two
versions of DMD approaches; one with hard thresholding and the other with
sorted bases selection. Also, we highlight the differences between
mean-subtracting the data (i.e., centering) and using the data without
mean-subtraction. We tested these ROMs using a system of 2D shallow water
equations for four different numerical experiments, adopting combinations of
sampling rates and resolutions. For these cases, we found that the DMD basis
obtained with hard threshodling is sensitive to sampling rate, performing worse
at very high rates. The sorted DMD algorithm helps to mitigate this problem and
yields more stabilized and converging solution. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that both DMD approaches with mean subtraction provide significantly more
accurate results than DMD with mean-subtracting the data. On the other hand,
POD is relatively insensitive to sampling rate and yields better representation
of the flow field. Meanwhile, resolution has little effect on both POD and DMD
performances. Therefore, we preferred to train the neural network in POD space,
since it is more stable and better represents our dataset. Numerical results
reveal that an artificial neural network on POD subspace (POD-ANN) performs
remarkably better than POD-GP and DMD in capturing system dynamics, even with a
small number of modes.

the mixing and circulation mechanisms in stellar interiors. The old open
cluster, M 67, has been well-studied for Li abundances in both main-sequence
and evolved stars. The Be abundances give us a probe to a deeper level in
stars. We have taken high-resolution spectra with Keck I with HIRES to
determine Be abundances along the subgiant branch of M 67, where there are
dramatic depletions of Li. These subgiants range in mass from 1.26 to 1.32
M$_{\odot}$ and have evolved from main-sequence stars that would have occupied
the region of the Li-Be dip found in younger clusters. Lithium abundances have
been adjusted to the same scale for 103 stars in M 67 by Pace et al. The more
massive stars $-$ now the coolest and furthest-evolved from the main-sequence
$-$ show a drop in Li by a factor of 400 across the subgiant branch. Our new Be
abundances also show a decline, but by a factor of $\sim$50. The two elements
decline together with Li showing a steeper decline in these subgiants than it
does in the Li-Be dip stars. The relative decline in Be abundance compared to
Li is remarkably well fit by the models of Sills & Deliyannis, made
specifically for the subgiants in M 67. Those models include the effects of
mixing induced by stellar rotation. These M 67 subgiants show the effects of
both main-sequence depletion and post-main-sequence dilution of both Li and Be.

demonstrate the strong dependence of interference pattern on the junction

Veselago focusing or normal caustics (similar to that in graphene) appears
resting on the doping configuration of the \textit{p-n} junctions, otherwise
anomalous caustics (different from that in graphene) occurs which is
manipulated by the junction direction and the doping configuration. Finally,
the developed Green's function technique is generally promising to uncover the
unique transport of emergent MDFs, and the discovered anomalous caustics makes
tilted MDFs potential applications in Dirac electron optics.

on the assumption of spherically symmetric density profiles. Yet, the cold dark
matter model predicts the shapes of dark matter halos to be triaxial. Halo
triaxiality, and the orientation of the major axis with respect to the line of
sight, are expected to be the leading cause of intrinsic scatter in
weak-lensing mass measurements. The shape of central cluster galaxies
(Brightest Cluster Galaxies; BCGs) is expected to follow the shape of the dark
matter halo. Here we investigate the use of BCG ellipticity as predictor of the
weak-lensing mass bias in individual clusters compared to the mean. Using weak
lensing masses $M^{\rm WL}_{500}$ from the Weighing the Giants project, and
$M_{500}$ derived from gas masses as low-scatter mass proxy, we find that, on
average, the lensing masses of clusters with the roundest / most elliptical 25%
of BCGs are biased $\sim 20$% high / low compared to the average, as
qualitatively predicted by the cold dark matter model. For cluster cosmology
projects utilizing weak-lensing mass estimates, the shape of the BCG can thus
contribute useful information on the effect of orientation bias in weak lensing

taken from recent efforts to develop synthetic transmission test cases, with
underlying real and reactive power in the distribution network assigned using
population information gathered from United States 2010 Census block data. The
methods illustrate how to create individual synthetic distribution feeders, and
groups of feeders across entire ZIP Code, with minimal input data for any
location in the United States. The framework also has the capability to output
data in \OpenDSS format to allow further simulation and analysis.

$c_i$. Recently, Frieze defined a notion of the perfect matching color profile
denoted by $\mcp(G)$, which is the set of vectors $(m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_q) \in
[n]^q$ such that there exists a perfect matching $M$ in $G$ with $|Q_i \cap M|

that $\sum_{i=1}^q \a_i = 1$. Let $G$ be the random bipartite graph
$G_{n,n,p}$. Suppose the edges of $G$ are independently colored with color
$c_i$ with probability $\alpha_i$. We determine the threshold for the event
$\mcp(G) = \set{(m_1, \ldots, m_q) \in [0,n]^q : m_1 + \cdots + m_q = n}$,

NeurIPS 2019 (Accepted)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Few-shot classification aims to recognize unlabeled samples from unseen

make few-shot classification very challenging. Many existing approaches
extracted features from labeled and unlabeled samples independently, as a
result, the features are not discriminative enough. In this work, we propose a
novel Cross Attention Network to address the challenging problems in few-shot
classification. Firstly, Cross Attention Module is introduced to deal with the
problem of unseen classes. The module generates cross attention maps for each
pair of class feature and query sample feature so as to highlight the target
object regions, making the extracted feature more discriminative. Secondly, a
transductive inference algorithm is proposed to alleviate the low-data problem,
which iteratively utilizes the unlabeled query set to augment the support set,
thereby making the class features more representative. Extensive experiments on
two benchmarks show our method is a simple, effective and computationally
efficient framework and outperforms the state-of-the-arts.

yields are measured over a wide transverse momentum ($p_{\rm{T}}$) range from

most central collisions radial flow is slightly larger at 5.02 TeV with respect
to 2.76 TeV. Particle ratios (p/$\pi$, K/$\pi$) as a function of $p_{\rm{T}}$
show pronounced maxima at $p_{\rm{T}}$ $\approx$ 3 GeV/$c$ in central Pb-Pb

those measured in pp collisions at the same energy and in Pb-Pb collisions at

same collision energy of 5.02 TeV, the nuclear modification factors for the
different particle species are derived. Within uncertainties, the nuclear
modification factor is particle species independent for high $p_{\rm{T}}$ and
compatible with measurements at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV. The results
are compared to state-of-the-art model calculations, which are found to

low-density environment is deterministic rather than diffusive, unlike that of
the wall counterparts located in the superclusters. Analyzing the data from the
Mira-Titan simulations for eleven different cosmologies including the standard
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology at various redshifts, we investigate the evolution of
the deterministic collapse barrier of the field clusters and explore its
dependence on the background cosmology. Regardless of the background cosmology,
the deterministic $\delta_{c}$ exhibits a universal behavior of having a higher
value than the Einstein-de Sitter spherical collapse barrier height of
$\delta_{sc}=1.686$, at $z=0$ but gradually converging down to $\delta_{sc}$ as
the dominance of dark energy diminishes with the increment of $z$. A
significant difference among different cosmologies, however, is found in its
convergence rate as well as in the critical redshift $z_{c}$ at which
$\delta_{c}=\delta_{sc}$. Showing that the convergence rate and critical
redshifts can distinguish even between the degenerate cosmologies which yield
almost identical linear growth factor and cluster mass functions, we suggest

a peak flux that was 3.4 mag brighter than the quiescent phase and then a
relatively moderate year-scale fading until the last observation, similar to
that of the accretion burst events such as EXors found in lower-mass young
stellar objects. The behavior of the Ks band light curve is similar to that
observed in 6.7 GHz class II methanol maser emission, with a sudden increase
followed by moderate year-scale fading. However, the maser emission peaks
appear 30-50 days earlier than that of the Ks band emission. The similarities
confirmed that the origins of the maser emission and the Ks band continuum

characteristics of the algorithms and their performance. In the aspect of

second, and third best algorithms, respectively. The numbers of correct
identifications of the six algorithms gradually increase as the size and SNR of

exhibit significant deviation in extracting the total flux of clumps. Taken
altogether, Fellwalker, Gaussclumps, and Dendrograms exhibit the best

temperature of the SC fluctuations depends on the measurement scheme. Here, we
shed light on the Higgs mode to investigate the SC fluctuations, as it is the

of SC phase coherence. We perform THz pump-optical probe spectroscopy for
underdoped and overdoped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi2212) thin films. The
oscillatory behavior in the pump-probe signal (THz Kerr signal) observed in the

previous work [K. Katsumi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 117001 (2018)], but two
onset temperatures are identified above $T_{\text{c}}$. Combined with the
results of the single crystals in a wide range of doping, we find that the
first onset $T_1^{\text{ons}}$ is 10-30 K above $T_{\text{c}}$.
$T_1^{\text{ons}}$ coincides with that of the superfluid density $N_s$

care or financial applications. This leads to potentially unbounded
ever-growing Big data streams and it needs to be utilized effectively. Data
normalization is an important preprocessing technique for data analytics. It
helps prevent mismodeling and reduce the complexity inherent in the data
especially for data integrated from multiple sources and contexts.
Normalization of Big Data stream is challenging because of evolving
inconsistencies, time and memory constraints, and non-availability of whole
data beforehand. This paper proposes a distributed approach to adaptive
normalization for Big data stream. Using sliding windows of fixed size, it
provides a simple mechanism to adapt the statistics for normalizing changing
data in each window. Implemented on Apache Storm, a distributed real-time
stream data framework, our approach exploits distributed data processing for
efficient normalization. Unlike other existing adaptive approaches that
normalize data for a specific use (e.g., classification), ours does not.
Moreover, our adaptive mechanism allows flexible controls, via user-specified
thresholds, for normalization tradeoffs between time and precision. The paper
illustrates our proposed approach along with a few other techniques and
experiments on both synthesized and real-world data. The normalized data
obtained from our proposed approach, on 160,000 instances of data stream,
improves over the baseline by 89% with 0.0041 root-mean-square error compared
with the actual data.

issues using two ideas. SNF allocates work at the granularity of flowlets
observed in network traffic, whereas billing and programming occur on the basis
of packets. SNF embellishes serverless platforms with ephemeral state that
lasts for the duration of the flowlet and supports high performance state
operations between compute units in a peer-to-peer manner. We present

projected cooling algorithm is able to construct the localized ground state of
any Hamiltonian with a translationally-invariant kinetic energy and
interactions that vanish at large distances. The term ""localized"" refers to
localization in position space. The method can be viewed as the quantum analog
of evaporative cooling. We start with an initial state with support over a
compact region of a large volume. We then drive the excited quantum states to
disperse and measure the remaining portion of the wave function left behind.
For the nontrivial examples we consider here, the improvement over other
methods is substantial. The only additional resource required is performing the
operations in a volume significantly larger than the size of the localized
state. These characteristics make the projected cooling algorithm a promising
tool for calculations of self-bound systems such as atomic nuclei.

non-invasive imaging technology to probe anatomical architectures of biological
samples. The anatomy of white matter fiber tracts in the brain can be revealed
to help understanding of the connectivity patterns among different brain
regions. In this paper, we propose a novel Nearest-neighbor Adaptive Regression
Model (NARM) for adaptive estimation of the fiber orientation distribution
(FOD) function based on D-MRI data, where spatial homogeneity is used to
improve FOD estimation by incorporating neighborhood information. Specifically,
we formulate the FOD estimation problem as a weighted linear regression
problem, where the weights are chosen to account for spatial proximity and
potential heterogeneity due to different fiber configurations. The weights are
adaptively updated and a stopping rule based on nearest neighbor distance is
designed to prevent over-smoothing. NARM is further extended to accommodate
D-MRI data with multiple bvalues.
  Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that NARM leads to satisfactory
FOD reconstructions and performs better than voxel-wise estimation as well as
competing smoothing methods. By applying NARM to real 3T D-MRI datasets, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of NARM in recovering more realistic crossing
fiber patterns and producing more coherent fiber tracking results, establishing
the practical value of NARM for analyzing D-MRI data and providing reliable
information on brain structural connectivity.

monitoring (SHM), however, is still a challenge because it requires continuous
data acquisition for the detection of random events such as earthquakes and
structural collapse. To achieve long-term operation, it is necessary to reduce

device is triggered by vibration, strain, or a timer and has a programmed
threshold, resulting in ultra-low-power consumption of the sensor node.
Furthermore, the proposed system can be easily reconfigured to any existing

in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in high risk contact sports has led
to increased scrutiny of head protective gear. In this work, we asked if it was
physically possible to prevent mTBI in American football with helmets alone.
Here, we show that modern helmets of several types are unlikely to prevent mTBI
from high speed collisions as might be seen in the NFL, but that introducing
liquid as an energy absorbing medium can dramatically reduce the forces of
impact across a spectrum of impact severities. We hypothesized that a helmet
which transmits a nearly constant force during football impacts is sufficient
to reduce biomechanical loading in the brain below the threshold of mTBI. To
test this hypothesis, we first show that the optimal impact force transmitted
to the head, in terms of brain strain, is in fact a constant force profile.
Then, to generate a constant force with a helmet, we implement a computational
model of a fluid-based shock absorber that adapts passively to any given impact
speed. Computer simulation of head impacts with liquid shock absorption
indicate that, at the highest impact speed, the average brain tissue strain is
reduced by 27.6% $\pm$ 9.3 compared to existing helmet padding that is
available on the market. These simulations are based on the NFL's helmet test
protocol and predict that adding liquid shock absorbers could reduce the number
of concussions by at least 75%. Taken together, these results suggest that the
majority of mTBI in football could be prevented with more efficient helmet
technology.

However, it is well known that dynamical models and controllers that use Euler
angle representations are prone to singularities and typically have smaller
regions of attraction while quaternion representations are subject to the
unwinding phenomenon. To avoid such complexities, we present a Geometric L1

adaptive control approach is implemented, with the attitude errors between the
quadrotor model and the reference model defined on the manifold. Control laws

degrade. For linear quadratic control, an event-triggered learning framework is
proposed that automatically detects inaccurate models and triggers the learning

probability distribution of the linear quadratic cost and designing a learning
trigger that leverages Chernoff bounds. In particular, whenever empirically
observed cost signals are located outside the derived confidence intervals, we
can provably guarantee that this is with high probability due to a model

i.e. ground surface clutter makes the task extremely difficult. In order to
remove ground clutter, conventional methods in the literature are not as much
effective as we need for objects buried detection in shallow depths. In this
paper, a robust method, based on Time gating and wiener filtering, is proposed,
which is very precise and effective in Ultra wideband (UWB) imaging. The
problem with time gating method solely is that the timing window length for
unknown target depths cannot be determined beforehand with sufficient accuracy.
Imprecise window length selection removes parts of target signals along with
the clutter and increases missed detection probability. This paper proposes an
algorithm to circumvent this problem by first using a wiener filter for
cancellation of ground clutter to a reasonable extent and pre detection of
target positions by average similarity function (ASF). The time gating method
is then used in the second step using the information provided from the first
step for window length selection. The combination of the two steps provides
better detection of shallow buried objects with less missed detection of
targets.

radiotherapy plays a more and more important role in cancer treatment. In the

evaluated for the purpose of killing tumor and protecting healthy tissue. Monte
Carlo (MC) radiation transport calculation is able to account for all aspects
of radiological physics within 3D heterogeneous media such as the human body

for doses in radiotherapy usually takes a great mass of time to achieve
acceptable statistical uncertainty, impeding the MC methods from wider clinic
applications. Here we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN), termed as
Monte Carlo Denoising Net (MCDNet), to achieve the acceleration of the MC dose
calculations in radiotherapy, which is trained to directly predict the
high-photon (noise-free) dose maps from the low-photon (noise-much) dose maps.
Thirty patients with postoperative rectal cancer who accepted
intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) were enrolled in this study. 3D
Gamma Index Passing Rate (GIPR) is used to evaluate the performance of
predicted dose maps. The experimental results demonstrate that the MCDNet can
improve the GIPR of dose maps of 1x107 photons over that of 1x108 photons,
yielding over 10x speed-up in terms of photon numbers used in the MC
simulations of IMRT. It is of great potential to investigate the performance of
this method on the other tumor sites and treatment modalities.

surveillance data at the central levels of government in many developing
nations has traditionally not included advanced analytics, there are
opportunities for the development and exploration of computational approaches
that can provide proactive insights and improve general health outcomes of
infectious disease outbreaks. We propose and demonstrate a multivariate time
series cross-correlation analysis as a foundational step towards gaining
insight on infectious disease patterns via the pairwise computation of weighted
cross-correlation scores for a specified disease across different health
districts using surveillance data from Cameroon. Following the computation of
weighted cross-correlation scores, we apply an anomaly detection algorithm to
assess how outbreak alarm patterns align in highly correlated health districts.
We demonstrate how multivariate cross-correlation analysis of weekly
surveillance data can provide insight into infectious disease incidence
patterns in Cameroon by identifying highly correlated health districts for a
given disease. We further demonstrate scenarios in which identification of
highly correlated districts aligns with alarms flagged using a standard anomaly
detection algorithm, hinting at the potential of end to end solutions combining
anomaly detection algorithms for flagging alarms in combination with
multivariate cross-correlation analysis.

receiving energy only through inter-particle collision. The velocity $v$ of a
particle that is driven is modified to $-r_w v+\eta$, where $r_w$ parameterises
the dissipation upon the driving and the noise $\eta$ is taken from a fixed

exactly the mean energies of the two species, based on the simplifying feature
that the correlation functions are seen to form a closed set of equations. The
asymptotic behaviour of the velocity distribution for large speeds is
determined for both components through a combination of exact analysis for a
range of parameters or obtained numerically to a high degree of accuracy from
an analysis of the large moments of velocity. We show that the tails of the
velocity distribution for both types of particles have similar behaviour, even
though they are driven differently. For dissipative driving ($r_w<1$), the
tails of the steady state velocity distribution show non-universal features and
depend strongly on the noise distribution. On the other hand, the tails of the

hampered by time-consuming steps and a large data requirement. To this end,
recent studies adopted a transfer learning strategy, especially domain
adaptation techniques. Among those, to our knowledge, an adversarial learning
has shown its potential in BCIs. In the meantime, it is known that adversarial
learning-based domain adaptation methods are prone to negative transfer that
disrupts learning generalized feature representations, applicable to diverse

found regions with co-phased broadband oscillations of the whole umbra. Their
spectrum includes the ~3-min harmonic, whose maximal value is localized in
umbral dots (UDs), and the low frequency part near the ~5-min period. It is
shown that the oscillation sources are displaced at different heights with
increasing angular size. We assume that the observed spatial distribution of

vertical magnetic field in the umbra and wave cutoff frequency due to

likelihood is extremely slow because it requires sampling from the model
distribution. Score matching potentially alleviates this problem. In
particular, denoising score matching \citep{vincent2011connection} has been
successfully used to train EBMs. Using noisy data samples with one fixed noise
level, these models learn fast and yield good results in data denoising
\citep{saremi2019neural}. However, demonstrations of such models in high
quality sample synthesis of high dimensional data were lacking. Recently,
\citet{song2019generative} have shown that a generative model trained by
denoising score matching accomplishes excellent sample synthesis, when trained
with data samples corrupted with multiple levels of noise. Here we provide
analysis and empirical evidence showing that training with multiple noise
levels is necessary when the data dimension is high. Leveraging this insight,
we propose a novel EBM trained with multi-scale denoising score matching. Our

by removing the need to explicitly track the time-dependent boundary, but
nonlinearities in the equations, noncoercive operators in the simplified Stokes

the biometric features into transformed templates while preserving the relative
distance between two templates for security and privacy protection. However,
distance preservation invites unexpected security issues such as pre-image
attacks, which are often neglected.This paper presents a generalized pre-image
attack method and its extension version that operates on practical CB systems.
We theoretically reveal that distance preservation property is a vulnerability
source in the CB schemes. We then propose an empirical information leakage
estimation algorithm to access the pre-image attack risk of the CB schemes. The
experiments conducted with six CB schemes designed for the face, iris and
fingerprint, demonstrate that the risks originating from the distance computed
from two transformed templates significantly compromise the security of CB
schemes. Our work reveals the potential risk of existing CB systems
theoretically and experimentally.

  in uniform and nonuniform stratifications",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Triadic resonance is one mechanism via which internal waves dissipate their
energy, often at locations away from their generation sites. In this paper, we
perform a combined theoretical and numerical study of triadic resonance in
internal wave modes in a finite-depth ocean with background rotation and an
arbitrary stratification profile. The spatial evolution of the modal amplitudes
within a resonant triad are first derived based on the requirement that the
nonlinear solution at leading order cannot diverge. The amplitude evolution
equations are then numerically solved for two different cases: (i) modes 1 and
2 at a specific frequency ({\omega_0}) in triadic resonance with the mode-1
superharmonic wave (2{\omega_0}) in a uniform stratification, and (ii) a
self-interacting mode-3 at a specific frequency {\omega_0} in triadic resonance
with the mode-2 (2{\omega_0}) in a nonuniform stratification representative of
the ocean. Quantitative estimates of energy transfer rates within the resonant
triad show that superharmonic wave generation resulting from modal interactions
should be an important consideration alongside other triadic resonances like
parametric subharmonic instability (PSI). Remarkably, in case (ii), the
amplitude evolution equations suggest that any initial energy in mode-3 at
{\omega_0} would get permanently transferred to mode-2 at frequency
2{\omega_0}. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are then performed to show the
spontaneous generation of superharmonic internal waves resulting from modal
interactions in the aforementioned two cases, and quantitatively validate the
initial spatial evolution of the wave field predicted by the amplitude
evolution equations. DNS at off-resonant frequencies are used to identify the
range of primary wave frequencies (around the resonant frequency) over which
spontaneous superharmonic wave generation occurs.

great promise for accelerating drug and materials discovery programs. A
frequently-overlooked modelling consideration in Bayesian optimisation
strategies however, is the representation of heteroscedastic aleatoric
uncertainty. In many practical applications it is desirable to identify inputs
with low aleatoric noise, an example of which might be a material composition

optimisation scheme capable of representing and minimising aleatoric noise

(GP) surrogate model in conjunction with two straightforward adaptations of
existing acquisition functions. First, we extend the augmented expected
improvement (AEI) heuristic to the heteroscedastic setting and second, we
introduce the aleatoric noise-penalised expected improvement (ANPEI) heuristic.
Both methodologies are capable of penalising aleatoric noise in the suggestions
and yield improved performance relative to homoscedastic Bayesian optimisation

and can only detect each other when they are in their observation space. We
focus on the challenge of effective cooperation between agents of a team.
Finding exact solutions for such multi-agent systems is difficult because of
the inherent complexity. We present Multi-Agent Pursuer-Evader Learning
(MAPEL), a class of algorithms that use spatio-temporal graph representation to
learn structured cooperation. The key concept is that the learning takes place
in a decentralized manner and agents use situation report updates to learn
about the whole environment from each others' partial observations. We use
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to parameterize the spatio-temporal graph. An
agent in MAPEL only updates all the other agents if an opponent or the target
is inside its observation space by using situation report. We present two
methods for cooperation via situation report update: a) Peer-to-Peer Situation
Report (P2PSR) and b) Ring Situation Report (RSR). We present a detailed
analysis of how these two cooperation methods perform when the number of agents
in the game are increased. We provide empirical results to show how agents

eventuality can be tweaked as desired, by tweaking the distributed bloom

possible to quickly compute new bloom filters when interacting with peers. The
second idea introduces the concept of unique bloom filter mappings between

bandwidth-efficient set reconciliation in networks. Instead of trying to
minimize the false positive rate of a single bloom filter, we use the unique
bloom filter mappings to increase the probability for an element to propagate
through a network. We compare the standard bloom filter with the distributed
bloom filter and show that even with a false positive rate of 50%, i.e. even
with a very small bloom filter size, the distributed bloom filter still manages
to reach complete set reconciliation across the network in a highly

development of such instabilities is a problem of both academic and industrial
interest. However, this has proven challenging in most cases due to the strong
nonlinearity and high dimensionality of the underlying equations. In the
present work, we successfully apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for the
control of the one-dimensional (1D) depth-integrated falling liquid film. In
addition, we introduce for the first time translational invariance in the
architecture of the DRL agent, and we exploit locality of the control problem
to define a dense reward function. This allows to both speed up learning
considerably, and to easily control an arbitrary large number of jets and
overcome the curse of dimensionality on the control output size that would take
place using a naive approach. This illustrates the importance of the
architecture of the agent for successful DRL control, and we believe this will
be an important element in the effective application of DRL to large
two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) systems featuring translational,

promising results in many application scenarios. Generally speaking, real-world
sequential user behaviors usually reflect a hybrid of sequential influences and
association relationships. However, most existing sequential recommendation
methods mainly concentrate on sequential relationships while ignoring
association relationships. In this paper, we propose a unified method that
incorporates item association and sequential relationships for sequential
recommendation. Specifically, we encode the item association as relations in
item co-occurrence graph and mine it through graph embedding by GCNs. In the
meanwhile, we model the sequential relationships through a widely used RNNs
based sequential recommendation method named GRU4Rec. The two parts are
connected into an end-to-end network with cascading style, which guarantees
that representations for item associations and sequential relationships are
learned simultaneously and make the learning process maintain low complexity.
We perform extensive experiments on three widely used real-world datasets:
TaoBao, Amazon Instant Video and Amazon Cell Phone and Accessories.
Comprehensive results have shown that the proposed method outperforms several
state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis is also provided
to encourage a better understanding about association relationships in
sequential recommendation and illustrate the performance gain is exactly from

the properties of an oxide-supported catalyst after annealing under reducing
conditions. The common explanation is the formation of heavily reduced,
ultrathin oxide films covering metal particles. This is typically encountered
for reducible oxides such as TiO2 or Fe3O4. Zirconia (ZrO2), a typical catalyst
support, is difficult to reduce and therefore no obvious candidate for the SMSI
effect. In this work, we use inverse model systems with Rh(111), Pt(111), and
Ru(0001) as supports. Contrary to expectations, we show that SMSI is
encountered for zirconia. Upon annealing in ultra-high vacuum, oxygen-deficient
ultrathin zirconia films ($\approx$ZrO$_{1.5}$) form on all three substrates.
However, Zr remains in its preferred charge state of 4+, as electrons are
transferred to the underlying metal. At high temperatures, the stability of the
ultrathin zirconia films depends on whether alloying of Zr and the substrate
metal occurs. The SMSI effect is reversible; the ultrathin suboxide films can
be removed by annealing in oxygen.

technique. Nonetheless, with the advent of Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
instruments characterized by a low sky background level and a high spatial
resolution (most notably WFC3), slitless spectroscopy has become an adopted
survey tool to study galaxy evolution from space. We investigate its
application to single object studies to measure not only redshift and
integrated spectral features, but also spatially resolved quantities such as
galaxy kinematics. We build a complete forward model to be quantitatively
compared to actual slitless observations. This model depends on a simplified
thin cold disk galaxy description -- including flux distribution, intrinsic
spectrum and kinematic parameters -- and on the instrumental signature. It is
used to improve redshifts and constrain basic rotation curve parameters, i.e.
plateau velocity $v_{0}$ (in $\rm km.s^{-1}$) and central velocity gradient
$w_{0}$ (in $\rm km.s^{-1}.arcsec^{-1}$). The model is tested on selected
observations from 3D-HST and GLASS surveys, to estimate redshift and kinematic
parameters on several galaxies measured with one or more roll angles. Our
forward approach allows to mitigate the self-contamination effect, a primary
drawback of slitless spectroscopy, and therefore has the potential to increase
precision on redshifts. In a limited sample of well-resolved spiral galaxies
from HST surveys, it is possible to significantly constrain galaxy rotation
curve parameters. This proof-of-concept work is promising for future large
slitless spectroscopic surveys such as EUCLID and WFIRST.

lattice matching epitaxy or domain matching epitaxy is discussed. The
morphology measured by atomic force microscopy showed a grainy surface,
probably arising from the growth by the columnar rotational domains visible in
TEM micrographs. The domain sizes measured by AFM and TEM increase with the
growth temperature, indicating an increasing surface diffusion length. Growth
at 850 $^{\circ}$C, however, involved local decomposition of the GaN substrate
that lead to an interfacial
$\mathrm{\beta}$-Ga$\mathrm{_{2}}$O$\mathrm{_{3}}$($\bar{\mathrm{{2}}}$01)
layer and a high NiO surface roughness. Raman mesurements of the
quasi-forbidden one-phonon peak indicate increasing layer quality (decreasing
defect density) with increasing growth temperature. The results above suggest
optimum growth temperatures around 700 $^{\circ}$C for high layer and interface
quality.

Motivated by some disagreement between the value of the barrier height obtained
from the TPT distributions as compared to the value obtained from kinetic and
thermodynamic analyses, we investigate here TPT for barriers which deviate from
the symmetric parabolic shape. We introduce a continuous set of potentials,
that starting from a parabolic shape, can be made increasingly asymmetric by
tuning a single parameter. The TPT distributions obtained in the asymmetric
case are very well-fitted by distributions generated by parabolic barriers. The

computationally demanding methods such as e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs). Some imaging modalities - notably biological and medical - can result
in images up to a few gigapixels in size, meaning that they have to be divided
into smaller parts, or patches, for processing. However, when performing image
segmentation, this may lead to undesirable artefacts, such as edge effects in
the final re-combined image. We introduce windowing methods from signal
processing to effectively reduce such edge effects. With the assumption that
the central part of an image patch often holds richer contextual information
than its sides and corners, we reconstruct the prediction by overlapping
patches that are being weighted depending on 2-dimensional windows. We compare
the results of four different windows: Hann, Bartlett-Hann, Triangular and a
recently proposed window by Cui et al., and show that the cosine-based Hann
window achieves the best improvement as measured by the Structural Similarity
Index (SSIM). The proposed windowing method can be used together with any CNN
model for segmentation without any modification and significantly improves
network predictions.

in learning theory taking its roots in the early works by Vapnik and

best known high probability upper bounds for uniformly stable learning
algorithms due to Bousquet and Elisseef (2002) are sub-optimal in some natural

outperform the simple generalization bound of Bousquet and Elisseef (2002).
Feldman and Vondrak also asked if it is possible to provide sharper bounds and
prove corresponding high probability lower bounds. This paper is devoted to
these questions: firstly, inspired by the original arguments of Feldman and
Vondrak (2019), we provide a short proof of the moment bound that implies the
generalization bound stronger than both recent results (Feldman and Vondrak,
2018, 2019). Secondly, we prove general lower bounds, showing that our moment
bound is sharp (up to a logarithmic factor) unless some additional properties
of the corresponding random variables are used. Our main probabilistic result
is a general concentration inequality for weakly correlated random variables,
which may be of independent interest.

density. Viscosity typically regularizes such singularities and leads to a
shock structure. On the other hand, in 1d, singularities in the Hopf equation
can be non-dissipatively smoothed via KdV dispersion. Here, we develop a
minimal conservative regularization of 3d ideal adiabatic flow of a gas with
polytropic exponent $\gamma$. It is achieved by augmenting the Hamiltonian by a
capillarity energy $\beta(\rho) (\nabla \rho)^2$. The simplest capillarity
coefficient leading to local conservation laws for mass, momentum, energy and
entropy using the standard Poisson brackets is $\beta(\rho) = \beta_*/\rho$ for
constant $\beta_*$. This leads to a Korteweg-like stress and nonlinear terms in
the momentum equation with third derivatives of $\rho$, which are related to
the Bohm potential and Gross quantum pressure. Just like KdV, our equations
admit sound waves with a leading cubic dispersion relation, solitary and
periodic traveling waves. As with KdV, there are no steady continuous
shock-like solutions satisfying the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. Nevertheless,
in 1d, for $\gamma = 2$, numerical solutions show that the gradient catastrophe
is averted through the formation of pairs of solitary waves which can display
approximate phase-shift scattering. Numerics also indicate recurrent behavior
in periodic domains. These observations are related to an equivalence between
our regularized equations (in the special case of constant specific entropy
potential flow in any dimension) and the defocussing nonlinear Schrodinger
equation (cubically nonlinear for $\gamma = 2$), with $\beta_*$ playing the
role of $\hbar^2$. Thus, our regularization of gas dynamics may be viewed as a
generalization of both the single field KdV & NLS equations to include the
adiabatic dynamics of density, velocity, pressure & entropy in any dimension.

science. In fields such as fraud detection, medical diagnostics, system

One common way to combat class imbalance is through resampling the minority
class to achieve a more balanced distribution. In this paper, we investigate
the performance of the sampling method based on kernel density estimation
(KDE). We believe that KDE offers a more natural way of generating new
instances of minority class that is less prone to overfitting than other
standard sampling techniques. It is based on a well established theory of
nonparametric statistical estimation. Numerical experiments show that KDE can
outperform other sampling techniques on a range of real life datasets as
measured by F1-score and G-mean. The results remain consistent across a number
of classification algorithms used in the experiments. Furthermore, the proposed
method outperforms the benchmark methods irregardless of the class distribution
ratio. We conclude, based on the solid theoretical foundation and strong
experimental results, that the proposed method would be a valuable tool in
problems involving imbalanced class distribution.

magnetic field. An electrostatic potential well created by a conducting or
non-conducting ring in the rf discharge confines the charged dust particles. In
the absence of the magnetic field, dust grains exhibit a thermal motion about
their equilibrium position. As the magnetic field crosses a threshold value (B
$>$ 0.02 T), the edge particles start to rotate and form a vortex in the
vertical plane. At the same time, the central region particles either exhibit
thermal motion or $\vec{E} \times \vec{B}$ motion in the horizontal plane. At B
$>$ 0.15 T, the central region dust grains start to rotate in the opposite
direction resulting in a pair of counter-rotating vortices in the vertical
plane. The characteristics of the vortex pair change with increasing the
strength of the magnetic field (B $\sim$ 0.8 T). At B $>$ 0.8 T, dust grains
exhibit very complex motion in the rotating torus. The angular frequency
variation of rotating particles indicates a differential or sheared dust
rotation in a vortex. The angular frequency increases with increasing the
magnetic field from 0.05 T to 0.8 T. The ion drag force and dust charge
gradient along with the E-field are considered as possible energy sources for
driving the edge vortex flow and central region vortex motion, respectively.
The directions of rotation also confirm the different energy sources

visualized using the hybrid parallel (MPI+TBB) ray-tracing engine OSPRay

interstellar gas, and how the first structures, the seeds of newborn stars are
shaped by this process.

the corresponding initial boundary value problem fits into the abstract setting

However, there is also a strong interest in computing globally optimal
solutions of nonconvex problems in offline simulations in order to benchmark
the faster suboptimal algorithms. Global solutions often rely on monotonicity
properties. A common approach is to reformulate problems into a canonical
monotonic optimization problem where the monotonicity becomes evident, but this
often comes at the cost of nested optimizations, increased numbers of

reformulations by revealing hidden monotonicity properties directly in the

from the area of signal processing for communications (including energy
efficiency for green communications, resource allocation in interference
networks, scheduling for fairness and quality of service, as well as beamformer
design in multiantenna systems), we demonstrate that the novel MMP approach
leads to tremendous complexity reductions compared to state-of-the-art methods

of five sources, three have the EHV component. Comparison of outflow forces
reveals that only the EHV jet in the youngest source Ser-emb 8 (N) has enough
momentum to power the slow outflow. The SiO abundance is generally enhanced
with velocity, while HCN is present in the slow and the fast wing, but
disappears in the EHV jet. For Ser-emb 8 (N), HCN and SiO show a bow-shock
shaped structure surrounding one of the EHV peaks suggesting sideways ejection
creating secondary shocks upon interaction with the surroundings. Also, the SiO
abundance in the EHV gas decreases with distance from this protostar, whereas
that in the fast wing increases. H$_2$CO is mostly associated with low-velocity
gas but also appears surprisingly in one of the bullets in the Ser-emb~8~(N)

is useful for, e.g., future Majorana qubits based on TIs. Furthermore, these
Dirac sub-bands can be manipulated by a magnetic flux and are an ideal platform
for generating stable Majorana zero modes (MZMs), which play a key role in
topological quantum computing. However, direct evidence for the Dirac sub-bands

thin ($\sim$40-nm diameter) nanowires of the bulk-insulating topological

across the Dirac point with gating, one can unambiguously identify the Dirac

In the case of Dirac neutrinos, PBHs radiate right-handed and left-handed
neutrinos in equal amounts, thus possibly increasing the effective number of
neutrino species, $N_{\rm eff}$. Assuming an initially monochromatic PBH mass
spectrum, with the initial mass $M_i$ related to the particle horizon mass, and
considering the current constraint on $N_{\rm eff}$, we derive a bound on the
initial PBH fraction $\beta^\prime$ in the interval $4.3\times 10^7\ {\rm

able to constraint the initial fraction for black hole masses as low as 1 g. If
an excess in $N_{\rm eff}$ is found, PBHs with Dirac neutrinos could provide a
minimal explanation of it. For example, for $10^7\ {\rm g} \lesssim M_i\lesssim
10^9$ g and $\beta^\prime \gtrsim 10^{-13}$, an excess radiation at the level
of $0.2\lesssim \Delta N_{\rm eff}\lesssim 0.37$ is produced, which can
alleviate the tension of the Hubble parameter measurements. Finally, we obtain

jet. PKS 1549-79 is one of the closest young, radio-loud quasars caught in an
on-going merger in which the AGN is in the first phases of its evolution. We
detect three structures tracing the accretion and the outflow of molecular gas:
kpc-scale tails of gas accreting onto PKS 1549-79, a circumnuclear disc (CND)
in the inner few hundred parsec, and a very broad (>2300 \kms) component
detected in CO(1-0) at the position of the AGN. Thus, in PKS 1549-79 we see the
co-existence of accretion and the ejection of gas. The line ratio
CO(1-0)/CO(3-2) suggests that the gas in the CND has both high densities and
high kinetic temperatures. We estimate a mass outflow rate of at least 650
msun/yr. This massive outflow is confined to r < 120 pc, which suggests that
the AGN drives the outflow. Considering the amount of molecular gas available
in CND and the observed outflow rate, we estimate a time scale of ~10^5 yr over
which the AGN would be able to destroy the CND, although gas from the merger
may come in from larger radii, rebuilding this disc at the same time. The AGN
appears to self-regulate gas accretion onto the super-massive black hole. From
a comparison with HST data, we find that the ionised gas outflow is more
extended. Nevertheless, the warm outflow is about two orders of magnitude less
massive than the molecular outflow. PKS 1549-79 does not seem to follow the
scaling relation between bolometric luminosity and the relative importance of
warm ionised and molecular outflows claimed to exist for other AGN. We argue
that, although PKS 1549-79 hosts a powerful quasar nucleus and an ultra-fast
outflow, the radio jet plays a significant role in producing the outflow.

which characterize the role and position of a node in the network. The relation
of these metrics to topological affiliation of the halo, i.e. to the type of

particular, the correlation coefficients between network metrics and topology
classes are computed. We have applied different machine learning methods to
test the predictive power of obtained network metrics and to check if one could
use network analysis as a tool for establishing topology of the large scale
structure of the Universe. Results of such predictions, combined in the
confusion matrix, show that it is not possible to give a good prediction of the
topology of Cosmic Web (score is $\approx$ 70 $\%$ in average) based only on
coordinates and velocities of nodes (halos), yet network metrics can give a
hint about the topological landscape of matter distribution.

$M_\nu$ based on modular $A_4$ invariant models without flavons. In these
models, all matter fields are assigned to three inequivalent singlets, ${\bf
1}$, ${\bf 1^\prime}$ and ${\bf 1^{\prime\prime}}$, of the finite modular group
$\Gamma_3 \simeq A_4$. Considering tensor products of the $A_4$ group, it is
easy to make the charged lepton mass matrix $M_\ell$ diagonal. Since not all
modular forms of a specific weight and level 3 can be arranged into three
inequivalent singlets of $A_4$ simultaneously, we can always make some entries
in $M_\nu$ vanish by properly assigning the representations and modular weights
for the matter fields. We consider two cases where neutrino masses originate
from the Weinberg operator and the type-I seesaw mechanism, respectively. For
the former case, all seven viable two-zero textures of $M_\nu$ (${\bf
A_{1,2}}$, ${\bf B_{1,2,3,4}}$ and ${\bf C}$) can be realized successfully. For
the latter case, only five of them (namely ${\bf A_{1,2}}$, ${\bf B_{3,4}}$ and
${\bf C}$) can be achieved due to the intrinsic structure of the right-handed
neutrino mass matrix $M_{\rm R}$ in our assumption for simplicity.

existing literature on fairness in machine learning. Yet, it is not preordained
that accuracy should decrease with increased fairness. Novel to this work, we
examine fair classification through the lens of mismatched hypothesis testing:
trying to find a classifier that distinguishes between two ideal distributions
when given two mismatched distributions that are biased. Using Chernoff
information, a tool in information theory, we theoretically demonstrate that,
contrary to popular belief, there always exist ideal distributions such that
optimal fairness and accuracy (with respect to the ideal distributions) are
achieved simultaneously: there is no trade-off. Moreover, the same classifier
yields the lack of a trade-off with respect to ideal distributions while
yielding a trade-off when accuracy is measured with respect to the given
(possibly biased) dataset. To complement our main result, we formulate an
optimization to find ideal distributions and derive fundamental limits to
explain why a trade-off exists on the given biased dataset. We also derive
conditions under which active data collection can alleviate the
fairness-accuracy trade-off in the real world. Our results lead us to contend
that it is problematic to measure accuracy with respect to data that reflects
bias, and instead, we should be considering accuracy with respect to ideal,
unbiased data.

diquark condensate approaches zero in a manner that is consistent with the ChPT

prove helpful in the design and operation of future satellite missions and

dramatically different from those of a single graphene layer, in particular
when the two layers are rotated relative to each other by a small angle. TBG
has recently attracted a great deal of interest, sparked by the discovery of
correlated insulating and superconducting states, for twist angle $\theta$
close to a so-called 'magic angle' $\approx 1.1{\deg}$. In this work, we
unveil, via near-field optical microscopy, a collective plasmon mode in
charge-neutral TBG near the magic angle, which is dramatically different from
the ordinary single-layer graphene intraband plasmon. In selected regions of
our samples, we find a gapped collective mode with linear dispersion, akin to
the bulk magnetoplasmons of a two-dimensional (2D) electron gas. We interpret
these as interband plasmons and associate those with the optical transitions
between quasi-localized states originating from the moir\'e superlattice.
Surprisingly, we find a higher plasmon group velocity than expected, which
implies an enhanced strength of the corresponding optical transition. This
points to a weaker interlayer coupling in the AA regions. These intriguing
optical properties offer new insights, complementary to other techniques, on

vectors to construct an utterance representation. To evaluate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach, NIST SRE 2008 Part1 dataset is used for training, and
two datasets, Switchboard Cellular part1 and CallHome American English Speech,

propose the Least Squares Disclosure Attack (LSDA), in which user profiles are
estimated by solving a least squares problem. We show that LSDA is not only
suitable for the analysis of threshold mixes, but can be easily extended to
attack pool mixes. Furthermore, contrary to previous heuristic-based attacks,
our approach allows us to analytically derive expressions that characterize the

to substantial spin polarization in a paramagnetic rare earth doped crystal,

on the combinations of atomic facts that are responsible for the result of a

has, for a long time, been largely confined to negation-free query languages, a
recent approach extends this to model checking problems for logics with full

dual-indeterminate polynomials or power series. So far, this approach has been
developed mainly for first-order logic and for the positive fragment of least
fixed-point logic. What has remained open is an adequate treatment for
fixed-point calculi that admit arbitrary interleavings of least and greatest
fixed points. We show that an adequate framework for the provenance analysis of
full fixed-point logics is provided by semirings that are (1) fully continuous,
(2) absorptive, and (3) chain-positive. Full continuity guarantees that
provenance values of least and greatest fixed-points are well-defined.
Absorptive semirings provide a symmetry between least and greatest fixed-point
computations and make sure that provenance values of greatest fixed points are
informative. Finally, chain-positivity is responsible for having
truth-preserving interpretations, which give non-zero values to all true
formulae. We further identify semirings of generalized absorptive polynomials
and prove universal properties that make them the most general appropriate
semirings for LFP. We illustrate the power of provenance interpretations in
these semirings by relating them to provenance values of plays and strategies

image planes. This mapping in the image plane is maintained within a depth of
field (or referred to as depth of focus, if the object is at infinity). This
necessitates refocusing of the lens when the images are separated by distances
larger than the depth of field. Such refocusing mechanisms can increase the
cost, complexity and weight of imaging systems. Here, we show that by judicious
design of a multi-level diffractive lens (MDL) it is possible to drastically
enhance the depth of focus, by over 4 orders of magnitude. Using such a lens,
we are able to maintain focus for objects that are separated by as large as ~6m
in our experiments. Specifically, when illuminated by collimated light at
lambda=0.85mm, the MDL produced a beam that remained in focus from 5mm to
~1500mm from the MDL. The measured full-width at half-maximum of the focused
beam varied from 6.6um (5mm away from MDL) to 524um (1500mm away from MDL).
Since the sidelobes were well suppressed and the main-lobe was close to the
diffraction-limit, imaging with a horizontal X vertical field of view of 20deg
x 15deg over the entire focal range was demonstrated. This demonstration opens
up a new direction for lens design, where by treating the phase in the focal
plane as a free parameter, extreme depth-of-focus imaging becomes possible.

the volume of states for the $\sqrt{x}$-based measure is infinite. So, the
validity of the earlier conjecture--as well as an alternative one, $\frac{1}{9}

examined through the numerical approach adopted, at least perhaps not without

  Learning: A Faroese Case Study","Submitted to the DeepLo workshop at EMNLP",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cross-lingual dependency parsing involves transferring syntactic knowledge
from one language to another. It is a crucial component for inducing dependency
parsers in low-resource scenarios where no training data for a language exists.
Using Faroese as the target language, we compare two approaches using
annotation projection: first, projecting from multiple monolingual source
models; second, projecting from a single polyglot model which is trained on the
combination of all source languages. Furthermore, we reproduce multi-source
projection (Tyers et al., 2018), in which dependency trees of multiple sources
are combined. Finally, we apply multi-treebank modelling to the projected
treebanks, in addition to or alternatively to polyglot modelling on the source
side. We find that polyglot training on the source languages produces an
overall trend of better results on the target language but the single best
result for the target language is obtained by projecting from monolingual
source parsing models and then training multi-treebank POS tagging and parsing
models on the target side.

stellar populations along the line-of-sight and interpret their properties in
combination with multi-wavelength photometry from GALACTICNUCLEUS and other

the different stellar components of the Galactic Centre (GC). In particular, we
use proper motions to detect co-moving groups of stars which can trace low mass
or partially dissolved young clusters in the GC that can hardly be discovered
by any other means. Our pilot study in this work is on a field in the nuclear
bulge associated by HII regions that show the presence of young stars. We
detect the first group of co-moving stars coincident with an HII region. Using
colour-magnitude diagrams, we infer that the co-moving stars are consistent
with being the post-main sequence stars with ages of few Myrs. Simulations show
that this group of stars is a real group that can indicate the existence of a
dissolving or low to intermediate mass young cluster. A census of these
undiscovered clusters will ultimately help us to constrain star formation at

Fluid Mech. 899 (2020) A5","10.1017/jfm.2020.424",,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Intuitively, crest speeds of water waves are assumed to match their phase
velocities. However, this is generally not the case for natural waves within
unsteady wave groups. This motivates our study, which presents new insights
into the generic behavior of crest speeds of linear to highly nonlinear
unsteady waves. While our major focus is on gravity waves where a generic crest
slowdown occurs cyclically, results for capillary-dominated waves are also
discussed, for which crests cyclically speed up. This curious phenomenon arises
when the theoretical constraint of steadiness is relaxed, allowing waves to
change their form, or shape. In particular, a kinematic analysis of both
simulated and observed open ocean gravity waves reveals a forward-to-backward
leaning cycle for each individual crest within a wave group. This is clearly
manifest during the focusing of dominant wave groups essentially due to the
dispersive nature of waves. It occurs routinely for focusing linear
(vanishingly small steepness) wave groups, and it is enhanced as the wave
spectrum broadens. It is found to be relatively insensitive to the degree of
phase coherence and focusing of wave groups. The nonlinear nature of waves
limits the crest slowdown. This reduces when gravity waves become less
dispersive, either as they steepen or as they propagate over finite water
depths. This is demonstrated by numerical simulations of the unsteady evolution
of 2D and 3D dispersive gravity wave packets in both deep and intermediate
water depths, and by open ocean space-time measurements.

fundamental problems: balanced sparse cut and $k$-vertex connectivity for small
$k$ ($k=O(\polylog n)$). Both problems can be solved in near-linear time with
randomized algorithms, but their previous deterministic counterparts take at
least quadratic time. In this paper, we break this bound for both problems.
Interestingly, achieving this for one problem crucially relies on doing so for
the other.
  In particular, via a divide-and-conquer argument, a variant of the
cut-matching game by [Khandekar et al.`07], and the local vertex connectivity
algorithm of [Nanongkai et al. STOC'19], we give a subquadratic time algorithm
for $k$-vertex connectivity using a subquadratic time algorithm for computing
balanced sparse cuts on sparse graphs. To achieve the latter, we improve the
previously best $mn$ bound for approximating balanced sparse cut for the whole
range of $m$. This starts from (1) breaking the $n^3$ barrier on dense graphs
to $n^{\omega + o(1)}$ (where $\omega < 2.372$) using the the PageRank matrix,
but without explicitly sweeping to find sparse cuts; to (2) getting the $\tilde
O(m^{1.58})$ bound by combining the $J$-trees by [Madry FOCS `10] with the
$n^{\omega + o(1)}$ bound above, and finally; to (3) getting the $m^{1.5 +

expander-based graph sparsification. Interestingly, our final $m^{1.5 + o(1)}$
bound lands at a natural stopping point in the sense that polynomially breaking

locust that detects looming objects and triggers the insect's escape responses.
Understanding the neural principles and network structure that lead to these
fast and robust responses can facilitate the design of efficient obstacle
avoidance strategies for robotic applications. Here we present a neuromorphic
spiking neural network model of the LGMD driven by the output of a neuromorphic
Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), which incorporates spiking frequency adaptation
and synaptic plasticity mechanisms, and which can be mapped onto existing
neuromorphic processor chips. However, as the model has a wide range of
parameters, and the mixed signal analogue-digital circuits used to implement
the model are affected by variability and noise, it is necessary to optimise
the parameters to produce robust and reliable responses. Here we propose to use
Differential Evolution (DE) and Bayesian Optimisation (BO) techniques to
optimise the parameter space and investigate the use of Self-Adaptive
Differential Evolution (SADE) to ameliorate the difficulties of finding
appropriate input parameters for the DE technique. We quantify the performance
of the methods proposed with a comprehensive comparison of different optimisers
applied to the model, and demonstrate the validity of the approach proposed
using recordings made from a DVS sensor mounted on a UAV.

three-nucleon interactions), effective field theory, and ab initio methods for
solving the nuclear many-body problem. While there are significant challenges
that must be addressed in developing this triad of theoretical tools, the rapid
advance of computing is accelerating progress. In particular, we focus this
review on the anticipated advances from lattice QCD and how these advances will
impact few-body effective theories of nuclear physics by providing critical
input, such as constraints on unknown low-energy constants of the effective
(field) theories. We also review particular challenges that must be overcome
for the successful application of lattice QCD for low-energy nuclear physics.
We describe progress in developing few-body effective (field) theories of
nuclear physics, with an emphasis on HOBET, a non-relativistic effective theory
of nuclear physics, which is less common in the literature. We use the examples
of neutrinoless double beta decay and the nuclear-matter equation of state to
illustrate how the coupling of lattice QCD to effective theory might impact our
understanding of symmetries and exotic astrophysical environments.

platform for topological qubits. The fluxonium is particularly suitable as a
readout circuit for topological qubits due to its unique persistent-current
based eigenstates. In this Letter, we present a magnetic-field compatible
hybrid fluxonium with an electrostatically-tuned semiconducting nanowire as its
non-linear element. We operate the fluxonium in magnetic fields up to 1T and
use it to observe the $\varphi_0$-Josephson effect. This combination of
gate-tunability and field-compatibility opens avenues for the exploration and
control of spin-polarized phenomena using superconducting circuits and enables
the use of the fluxonium as a readout device for topological qubits.

develop a better understanding of the human brain functionality, including
positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, and
functional magnetic resonance imaging, all of which provide brain images with
millimeter spatial resolutions. Despite good spatial resolution, time
resolution of these methods are poor and values are about seconds.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive electrophysiological
technique of relatively very high time resolution which is used to measure
electric potential of brain neural activity. Scalp EEG recordings can be used
to perform the inverse problem in order to specify the location of the dominant
sources of the brain activity. In this paper, EEG source localization research
is clustered as follows: solving the inverse problem by statistical method
(37.5%), diagnosis of brain abnormalities using common EEG source localization
methods (18.33%), improving EEG source localization methods by non-statistical
strategies (3.33%), investigating the effect of the head model on EEG source
imaging results (12.5%), detection of epileptic seizures by brain activity
localization based on EEG signals (20%), diagnosis and treatment of ADHD
abnormalities (8.33%). Among the available methods, minimum norm solution has
shown to be very promising for sources with different depths. This review
investigates diseases that are diagnosed using EEG source localization
techniques. In this review we provide enough evidence that the effects of
psychiatric drugs on the activity of brain sources have not been enough
investigated, which provides motivation for consideration in the future
research using EEG source localization methods.

perturbations at small scales, the TCC would impose a lower bound on the PBH
mass $M_\mathrm{PBH}>\gamma(H_\mathrm{end}/10^9\,\mathrm{GeV})^2\,M_\odot$
regardless of the details for reheating history, where $\gamma$ is the collapse
efficiency factor and $H_\mathrm{end}$ is the Hubble scale at the end of
inflation. In particular, the current open window for PBHs to make up all the
cold dark matter could be totally ruled out if the inflationary Hubble scale is
larger than 10 TeV. For the case of PBHs formed in an early matter-dominated
era, an upper mass bound is obtained.

this study, we propose a framework for creating a three-dimensional (3D)
weights of evidence-based prospectivity model of the Nochoun porphyry Cu
deposit in the Urmia-Dokhtar magmatic arc of Iran. The input data include
qualitative geological and quantitative geochemical information obtained from
boreholes and field observations. We combine ordinary and fuzzy weights of
evidence for integrating qualitative and quantitative exploration criteria in a
3D space constrained by a metallogenic model of the study area for identifying
a deep-seated ore body. Ordinary weights of evidence are determined for
geological data, including lithology, alteration, rock type, and structure.
Moreover, we determine the fuzzy weight of evidence for each class of
continuous geochemical models created based on Fe, Mo, and Zn concentration
values derived from boreholes. We integrate the input evidential models using
WofE and create two prospectivity models (i.e., posterior and studentized
posterior probability). We also determine anomalous voxels in the probability
models using concentration-volume fractal models and validate them using
prediction-volume plots. The modeling results indicate that the studentized
posterior probability model is more efficient in identifying voxels
representing copper mineralized rock volumes. We provide open source software
for the proposed framework which can be used for exploring deep-seated ore
bodies in other regions.

area of a triangle, as a symmetric function of the lengths of its sides. It has
been extended by Brahmagupta to quadrilaterals inscribed in a circle (cyclic
quadrilaterals). A natural problem is trying to further generalize the result
to cyclic polygons with a larger number of edges, which, surprisingly, has
revealed to be far from simple. In this paper we investigate such a problem by
following a new and elementary approach. We start from the simple observation
that the incircle of a right triangle touches its hypothenuse in a point that
splits it into two segments, the product of whose lengths equals the area of
the triangle. From this curious fact we derive in a few lines: an unusual proof
of the Pythagoras' theorem, Heron's theorem for right triangles, Heron's
theorem for general triangles, and Brahmagupta's theorem for cyclic
quadrangles. This suggests that cutting the edges of a cyclic polygon by means
of suitable points should be the ""right"" working method. Indeed, following this
idea, we obtain an explicit formula for the area of any convex cyclic polygon,
as a symmetric function of the segments split on its edges by the incircles of
a triangulation. We also show that such a symmetry can be rediscovered in
Heron's and Brahmagupta's results, which consequently represent special cases

TPE mainly involves two steps. First, the speckle parts mixed in the acquired

microtubules play a role in the nature of consciousness. The theory was largely
dismissed due to the fact that quantum effects were thought unlikely to occur
in biological systems, which are warm and wet and subject to decoherence.
However, the development of quantum biology now suggests otherwise. Quantum
effects have been implicated in photosynthesis, a process fundamental to life
on earth. They are also possibly at play in other biological processes such as
avian migration and olfaction. The microtubule mechanism of quantum
consciousness has been joined by other theories of quantum cognition. It has
been proposed that general anaesthetic, which switches off consciousness, does
this through quantum means, measured by changes in electron spin. The
tunnelling hypothesis developed in the context of olfaction has been applied to
the action of neurotransmitters. A recent theory outlines how quantum
entanglement between phosphorus nuclei might influence the firing of neurons.
These, and other theories, have contributed to a growing field of research that
investigates whether quantum effects might contribute to neural processing.
This review aims to investigate the current state of this research and how
fully the theory is supported by convincing experimental evidence. It also aims
to clarify the biological sites of these proposed quantum effects and how

demand prediction that has been examined by many previous studies, OD-based
demand prediction is more challenging. This is mainly due to the complicated
spatial and temporal dependencies among demand of different OD pairs. To
overcome this challenge, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Encoder-Decoder
Residual Multi-Graph Convolutional network (ST-ED-RMGC), a novel deep learning
model for predicting ride-sourcing demand of various OD pairs. Firstly, the
model constructs OD graphs, which utilize adjacent matrices to characterize the
non-Euclidean pair-wise geographical and semantic correlations among different
OD pairs. Secondly, based on the constructed graphs, a residual multi-graph
convolutional (RMGC) network is designed to encode the contextual-aware spatial
dependencies, and a long-short term memory (LSTM) network is used to encode the
temporal dependencies, into a dense vector space. Finally, we reuse the RMGC
networks to decode the compressed vector back to OD graphs and predict the

typically has the following sequential events: ""exposure -> click ->
conversion"". Conventional CVR estimators are trained in the click space, but
the inference is done in the entire exposure space. They fail to account for
the causes of the missing data and treat them as missing at random. Hence,
their estimations are highly likely to deviate from the real values by large.
In addition, the data sparsity issue can also handicap many industrial CVR

based on 3-manifolds. Here, we will use Thurston's geometrization theorem to
get a simple picture: fermions as hyperbolic knot complements (a complement
$C(K)=S^{3}\setminus(K\times D^{2})$ of a knot $K$ carrying a hyperbolic
geometry) and bosons as torus bundles. In particular, hyperbolic 3-manifolds
have a close connection to number theory (Bloch group, algebraic K-theory,
quaternionic trace fields), which~will be used in the description of fermions.
Here, we choose the description of 3-manifolds by branched covers. Every
3-manifold can be described by a 3-fold branched cover of $S^{3}$ branched
along a knot. In case of knot complements, one will obtain a 3-fold branched
cover of the 3-disk $D^{3}$ branched along a 3-braid or 3-braids describing
fermions. The whole approach will uncover new symmetries as induced by quantum
and discrete groups. Using the Drinfeld--Turaev quantization, we will also
construct a quantization so that quantum states correspond to knots. Particle
properties like the electric charge must be expressed by topology, and we will
obtain the right spectrum of possible values. Finally, we will get a connection
to recent models of Furey, Stoica and Gresnigt using octonionic and
quaternionic algebras with relations to 3-braids (Bilson--Thompson model).

Intelligence (AI) in real-world applications such as computer vision and
recommendations. For example, recognition algorithms in computer vision are
unfair to black people such as poorly detecting their faces and inappropriately
identifying them as ""gorillas"". As one crucial application of AI, dialogue
systems have been extensively applied in our society. They are usually built
with real human conversational data; thus they could inherit some fairness
issues which are held in the real world. However, the fairness of dialogue
systems has not been well investigated. In this paper, we perform a pioneering
study about the fairness issues in dialogue systems. In particular, we
construct a benchmark dataset and propose quantitative measures to understand
fairness in dialogue models. Our studies demonstrate that popular dialogue
models show significant prejudice towards different genders and races. Besides,
to mitigate the bias in dialogue systems, we propose two simple but effective
debiasing methods. Experiments show that our methods can reduce the bias in
dialogue systems significantly. The dataset and the implementation are released
to foster fairness research in dialogue systems.

incompressible materials are involved, commonly exhibiting the locking
phenomenon. Interior penalty (IP) discontinuous Galerkin methods have been
shown to circumvent locking when simplicial elements are used. The same IP
methods, however, result in locking on meshes of quadrilaterals. The authors
have shown in earlier work that under-integration of specified terms in the IP
formulation eliminates the locking problem for rectangular elements. Here it is
demonstrated through an extensive numerical investigation that the effect of
using under-integration carries over successfully to meshes of more general
quadrilateral elements, as would likely be used in practical applications, and
results in accurate displacement approximations. Uniform convergence with
respect to the compressibility parameter is shown numerically. Additionally, a
stress approximation obtained here by postprocessing shows good convergence in

and thus generally introduced as the dephasing time in the simulations of the
solid-state high-harmonic generation. This characteristic time linked with the
coherent decay of quantum trajectory controls the emergence of the spectral
splittings in the high harmonic spectroscopy, which can been attributed to the
temporal interference between two adjacent harmonic emission channels. To
reproduce the harmonic peaks and spectral splittings, a temporal two-slit
interference model in the momentum space is introduced. In addition, mechanisms
of spectral splitting provide a state-of-the-art avenue to probe the
characteristic elapse between electron and hole. Based on the subfemtosecond
resolution of the spectral interference opening and closing zones in the
wavelength-dependent high-order harmonic spectra, we also propose an

techniques have been proposed to reduce computation redundancy. Converting
convolutional layers into frequency domain significantly reduces the
computation complexity of the sliding window operations in space domain. On the
other hand, weight pruning techniques address the redundancy in model
parameters by converting dense convolutional kernels into sparse ones. To
obtain high-throughput FPGA implementation, we propose SPEC2 -- the first work
to prune and accelerate spectral CNNs. First, we propose a systematic pruning
algorithm based on Alternative Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The
offline pruning iteratively sets the majority of spectral weights to zero,
without using any handcrafted heuristics. Then, we design an optimized pipeline
architecture on FPGA that has efficient random access into the sparse kernels
and exploits various dimensions of parallelism in convolutional layers.
Overall, SPEC2 achieves high inference throughput with extremely low
computation complexity and negligible accuracy degradation. We demonstrate
SPEC2 by pruning and implementing LeNet and VGG16 on the Xilinx Virtex
platform. After pruning 75% of the spectral weights, SPEC2 achieves 0% accuracy
loss for LeNet, and <1% accuracy loss for VGG16. The resulting accelerators
achieve up to 24x higher throughput, compared with the state-of-the-art FPGA
implementations for VGG16.

do not change along short video sequences. For the considered datasets, this is
the identity of the generated face. The other subspace controls motion
attributes, those attributes that are observed to change along short videos. We
observed that these motion attributes are face expressions, head orientation,
lips and eyes movement. The presented experiments provide quantitative and
qualitative evidence supporting that the proposed methodology induces a
disentangling of this two kinds of attributes in the latent space.

GANs, as they only optimize a single cross entropy loss function, which is
monotonic and avoids the circular convergence issues of the GAN minimax
objective. In addition, we also show how to condition Glow on external context,
while still preserving the invertible nature of each ""flow"" layer. Finally, we
evaluate the proposed Glow model by calculating cross entropy on a held-out
validation set of videos, in order to compare multiple versions of the proposed

spent in creating new rating systems. However, the input statistics for such
ratings are subject to randomness and factors outside the quarterback's
control. To investigate this variance, we perform a sensitivity analysis of
three quarterback rating statistics: the Traditional 1971 rating by Smith, the
Burke, and the Wages of Wins ratings. The comparisons are made at the team
level for the 32 NFL teams from 2002-2015, thus giving each case an even 16
games. We compute quarterback ratings for each offense with 1-5 additional
touchdowns, 1-5 fewer interceptions, 1-5 additional sacks, and a 1-5 percent
increase in the passing completion rate. Our sensitivity analysis provides
insight into whether an elite passing team could seem mediocre or vice versa
based on random outcomes. The results indicate that the Traditional rating is
the most sensitive statistic with respect to touchdowns, interceptions, and
completions, whereas the Burke rating is most sensitive to sacks. The analysis
suggests that team passing offense rankings are highly sensitive to aspects of
football that are out of the quarterback's hands (e.g., deflected passes that
lead to interceptions). Thus, on the margins, we show arguments about whether a
specific quarterback has entered the elite or remains mediocre are irrelevant.
