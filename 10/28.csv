field reconnection are inherently related phenomena. Turbulent fluctuations
generate regions of a sheared magnetic field that become unstable to the
tearing instability and reconnection, thus modifying turbulence at the
corresponding scales. In this contribution, we give a brief discussion of some
recent results on tearing-mediated magnetic turbulence. We illustrate the main
ideas of this rapidly developing field of study by concentrating on two
important examples -- magnetohydrodynamic Alfv\'en turbulence and small-scale
kinetic-Alfv\'en turbulence. Due to various potential applications of these
phenomena in space physics and astrophysics, we specifically try not to
overload the text by heavy analytical derivations, but rather present a
qualitative discussion accessible to a non-expert in the theories of turbulence
and reconnection.

Ideally protein structures should be solved in environments as close to the

Instead, membrane proteins are typically transferred from their native membrane

develop alternative high-resolution techniques which are compatible with

  VLDB'20)",,,,"cs.DC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-volatile main memory (NVRAM) technologies provide an attractive set of
features for large-scale graph analytics, including byte-addressability, low
idle power, and improved memory-density. NVRAM systems today have an order of
magnitude more NVRAM than traditional memory (DRAM). NVRAM systems could
therefore potentially allow very large graph problems to be solved on a single
machine, at a modest cost. However, a significant challenge in achieving high
performance is in accounting for the fact that NVRAM writes can be much more
expensive than NVRAM reads.
  In this paper, we propose an approach to parallel graph analytics using the
Parallel Semi-Asymmetric Model (PSAM), in which the graph is stored as a
read-only data structure (in NVRAM), and the amount of mutable memory is kept
proportional to the number of vertices. Similar to the popular semi-external
and semi-streaming models for graph analytics, the PSAM approach assumes that
the vertices of the graph fit in a fast read-write memory (DRAM), but the edges
do not. In NVRAM systems, our approach eliminates writes to the NVRAM, among
other benefits.
  To experimentally study this new setting, we develop Sage, a parallel
semi-asymmetric graph engine with which we implement provably-efficient (and
often work-optimal) PSAM algorithms for over a dozen fundamental graph
problems. We experimentally study Sage using a 48-core machine on the largest
publicly-available real-world graph (the Hyperlink Web graph with over 3.5
billion vertices and 128 billion edges) equipped with Optane DC Persistent
Memory, and show that Sage outperforms the fastest prior systems designed for
NVRAM. Importantly, we also show that Sage nearly matches the fastest prior
systems running solely in DRAM, by effectively hiding the costs of repeatedly
accessing NVRAM versus DRAM.

related to phase transitions and to Hagedorn behavior in the $(-1)^F$-graded

analysis is a generalization of the Lee-Yang-Fisher-type analysis for a theory

exhibits a self-normalizing property that mirrors Weight Normalization, a
previously studied mechanism that fulfills many of the features of Batch
Normalization in an online fashion. The normalization of activities during
training speeds up convergence by preventing internal covariate shift caused by
changes in the input distribution. The always-on stochasticity of the NSM
confers the following advantages: the network is identical in the inference and
learning phases, making the NSM suitable for online learning, it can exploit
stochasticity inherent to a physical substrate such as analog non-volatile
memories for in-memory computing, and it is suitable for Monte Carlo sampling,
while requiring almost exclusively addition and comparison operations. We
demonstrate NSMs on standard classification benchmarks (MNIST and CIFAR) and

is to regard CP decomposition as a nonlinear least squares problem and employ
Newton-like methods. Direct solution of linear systems involving an
approximated Hessian is generally expensive. However, recent advancements have
shown that use of an implicit representation of the linear system makes these
methods competitive with alternating least squares. We provide the first
parallel implementation of a Gauss-Newton method for CP decomposition, which
iteratively solves linear least squares problems at each Gauss-Newton step. In
particular, we leverage a formulation that employs tensor contractions for
implicit matrix-vector products within the conjugate gradient method. The use
of tensor contractions enables us to employ the Cyclops library for
distributed-memory tensor computations to parallelize the Gauss-Newton approach
with a high-level Python implementation. In addition, we propose a
regularization scheme for Gauss-Newton method to improve convergence properties
without any additional cost. We study the convergence of variants of the

Since most of the studies employed enhanced two-neutron interactions to follow
the evolution of an artificially bound state into a continuum one, we examine
several enhancement schemes that produce a bound dineutron as well. Methods: We
study the four-neutron system by solving exact four-particle equations. By
varying the interaction enhancement factor we calculate two-dineutron
scattering phase shifts and cross sections. Results: When the same enhancement
factor is used in all partial waves, a bound tetraneutron emerges together with
a strongly bound dineutron. Furthermore, such a 0+ tetraneutron evolves not
into a resonance but into a virtual state. Weak enhancement of S waves together
with strongly enhanced higher waves is needed for the emergence of the resonant
state. Anyhow the resonant behavior disappears well before reaching the
physical interaction strength. Conclusions: The interaction enhancement scheme
using the same factor for all waves, employed in several previous works, is
misleading for the search of 0+ resonance as only a virtual state can emerge.
Evolution of a bound tetraneutron into a resonance via an intermediate virtual
state is possible with strong enhancement of higher two-neutron waves.

given inputs influence the output of a predictive model are crucial for
understanding, validating, and interpreting machine-learning models. However,
providing fast and accurate estimates of feature importance for
high-dimensional data, and quantifying the uncertainty of such estimates remain
open challenges. Here, we frame the task of providing explanations for the
decisions of machine-learning models as a causal learning task, and train
causal explanation (CXPlain) models that learn to estimate to what degree
certain inputs cause outputs in another machine-learning model. CXPlain can,
once trained, be used to explain the target model in little time, and enables
the quantification of the uncertainty associated with its feature importance
estimates via bootstrap ensembling. We present experiments that demonstrate
that CXPlain is significantly more accurate and faster than existing
model-agnostic methods for estimating feature importance. In addition, we
confirm that the uncertainty estimates provided by CXPlain ensembles are
strongly correlated with their ability to accurately estimate feature
importance on held-out data.

Football League (NFL) for their 2019 Big Data Bowl competition, we introduce
the Expected Hypothetical Completion Probability (EHCP), a objective framework
for evaluating plays. At the heart of EHCP is the question ""on a given passing
play, did the quarterback throw the pass to the receiver who was most likely to
catch it?"" To answer this question, we first built a Bayesian non-parametric
catch probability model that automatically accounts for complex interactions
between inputs like the receiver's speed and distances to the ball and nearest
defender. While building such a model is, in principle, straightforward, using
it to reason about a hypothetical pass is challenging because many of the model
inputs corresponding to a hypothetical are necessarily unobserved. To wit, it
is impossible to observe how close an un-targeted receiver would be to his
nearest defender had the pass been thrown to him instead of the receiver who
was actually targeted. To overcome this fundamental difficulty, we propose
imputing the unobservable inputs and averaging our model predictions across
these imputations to derive EHCP. In this way, EHCP can track how the
completion probability evolves for each receiver over the course of a play in a
way that accounts for the uncertainty about missing inputs.

  Fork-Join Parallel Programs",,,,,"cs.DS cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Software engineers designing recursive fork-join programs destined to run on
massively parallel computing systems must be cognizant of how their program's
memory requirements scale in a many-processor execution. Although tools exist
for measuring memory usage during one particular execution of a parallel
program, such tools cannot bound the worst-case memory usage over all possible
parallel executions.
  This paper introduces Cilkmem, a tool that analyzes the execution of a
deterministic Cilk program to determine its $p$-processor memory high-water
mark (MHWM), which is the worst-case memory usage of the program over \emph{all
possible} $p$-processor executions. Cilkmem employs two new algorithms for
computing the $p$-processor MHWM. The first algorithm calculates the exact
$p$-processor MHWM in $O(T_1 \cdot p)$ time, where $T_1$ is the total work of
the program. The second algorithm solves, in $O(T_1)$ time, the approximate
threshold problem, which asks, for a given memory threshold $M$, whether the
$p$-processor MHWM exceeds $M/2$ or whether it is guaranteed to be less than
$M$. Both algorithms are memory efficient, requiring $O(p \cdot D)$ and $O(D)$
space, respectively, where $D$ is the maximum call-stack depth of the program's
execution on a single thread.
  Our empirical studies show that Cilkmem generally exhibits low overheads.
Across ten application benchmarks from the Cilkbench suite, the exact algorithm
incurs a geometric-mean multiplicative overhead of $1.54$ for $p=128$, whereas
the approximation-threshold algorithm incurs an overhead of $1.36$ independent
of $p$. In addition, we use Cilkmem to reveal and diagnose a previously unknown
issue in a large image-alignment program contributing to unexpectedly high
memory usage under parallel executions.

recently attracted a great deal of interest in various disciplines such as
neuroscience or climatology. A multitude of similarity measures has been
proposed for this purpose, including Event Synchronization (ES) and Event
Coincidence Analysis (ECA) as two widely applicable examples. While ES defines
synchrony in a data adaptive local way that does not distinguish between
different time scales, ECA requires selecting a specific scale for analysis. In
this paper, we use slightly modified versions of both ES and ECA that address
previous issues with respect to proper normalization and boundary treatment,
which are particularly relevant for short time series with low temporal
resolution. By numerically studying threshold crossing events in coupled
autoregressive processes, we identify a practical limitation of ES when
attempting to study synchrony between serially dependent event sequences
exhibiting event clustering in time. Practical implications of this observation
are demonstrated for the case of functional network representations of climate
extremes based on both ES and ECA, while no marked differences between both
measures are observed for the case of epileptic electroencephalogram (EEG)
data. Our findings suggest that careful event detection along with diligent
preprocessing is recommended when applying ES while less crucial for ECA.
Despite the lack of a general modus operandi for both event definition and
detection of synchronization, we suggest ECA as a widely robust method,
especially for time resolved synchronization analyses of event time series from
various disciplines.

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), to solve a wide range of problems. Many
accelerators are proposed using specialized hardware to address sampling
inefficiency, the critical performance bottleneck of probabilistic algorithms.
These accelerators usually improve the hardware efficiency by using some
approximation techniques, such as reducing bit representation, truncating small
values to zero, or simplifying the Random Number Generator (RNG). Understanding
the influence of these approximations on result quality is crucial to meeting
the quality requirements of real applications. Although a common approach is to
compare the end-point result quality using community-standard benchmarks and
metrics, we claim a probabilistic architecture should provide some measure (or
guarantee) of statistical robustness.
  This work takes a first step towards quantifying the statistical robustness
of specialized hardware MCMC accelerators by proposing three pillars of
statistical robustness: sampling quality, convergence diagnostic, and goodness
of fit. Each pillar has at least one quantitative metric without the need to
know the ground truth data. We apply this method to analyze the statistical
robustness of an MCMC accelerator proposed by previous work, with some
modifications, as a case study. The method also applies to other probabilistic
accelerators and can be used in design space exploration.

However, a critical barrier in applying EP is that the moment matching in

tricky, and lacks generalizability. Importance sampling is very expensive.
While Laplace propagation provides a good solution, it has to run numerical
optimizations to find Laplace approximations in every update, which is still
quite inefficient. To overcome these practical barriers, we propose conditional
expectation propagation (CEP) that performs conditional moment matching given
the variables outside each message, and then takes expectation w.r.t the
approximate posterior of these variables. The conditional moments are often
analytical and much easier to derive. In the most general case, we can use
(fully) factorized messages to represent the conditional moments by quadrature
formulas. We then compute the expectation of the conditional moments via Taylor
approximations when necessary. In this way, our algorithm can always conduct
efficient, analytical fixed point iterations. Experiments on several popular

saliency to characterize the importance of input features to predictions made

Neural Networks (RNNs) has mostly targeted language tasks, and their
applicability to time series data is less understood. In this work we analyze
saliency-based methods for RNNs, both classical and gated cell architectures.
We show that RNN saliency vanishes over time, biasing detection of salient
features only to later time steps and are, therefore, incapable of reliably
detecting important features at arbitrary time intervals. To address this
vanishing saliency problem, we propose a novel RNN cell structure (input-cell
attention), which can extend any RNN cell architecture. At each time step,
instead of only looking at the current input vector, input-cell attention uses
a fixed-size matrix embedding, each row of the matrix attending to different
inputs from current or previous time steps. Using synthetic data, we show that
the saliency map produced by the input-cell attention RNN is able to faithfully
detect important features regardless of their occurrence in time. We also apply
the input-cell attention RNN on a neuroscience task analyzing functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data for human subjects performing a variety
of tasks. In this case, we use saliency to characterize brain regions (input
features) for which activity is important to distinguish between tasks. We show
that standard RNN architectures are only capable of detecting important brain
regions in the last few time steps of the fMRI data, while the input-cell
attention model is able to detect important brain region activity across time
without latter time step biases.

past few years which developed and analyzed algorithms for natural geodesically
convex optimization problems on Riemannian manifolds that arise from the
symmetries of non-commutative groups. These algorithms minimize the moment map
(a non-commutative notion of the usual gradient) and test membership in null
cones and moment polytopes (a vast class of polytopes, typically of exponential
vertex and facet complexity, which arise from this a priori non-convex,
non-linear setting). This setting captures a diverse set of problems in
different areas of computer science, mathematics, and physics. Several of them
were solved efficiently for the first time using non-commutative methods; the
corresponding algorithms also lead to solutions of purely structural problems
and to many new connections between disparate fields.
  In the spirit of standard convex optimization, we develop two general methods
in the geodesic setting, a first order and a second order method, which
respectively receive first and second order information on the ""derivatives"" of
the function to be optimized. These in particular subsume all past results. The
main technical work goes into identifying the key parameters of the underlying
group actions which control convergence to the optimum in each of these
methods. These non-commutative analogues of ""smoothness"" are far more complex
and require significant algebraic and analytic machinery. Despite this
complexity, the way in which these parameters control convergence in both
methods is quite simple and elegant. We show how to bound these parameters and
hence obtain efficient algorithms for null cone membership in several concrete
situations. Our work points to intriguing open problems and suggests further
research directions.

formulation of the method of critical polynomials; developed in the last few
years, it has already proven to be orders of magnitude more accurate than
traditional techniques. Here we report the result of large parallel
calculations to produce what we believe may become the reference values of bond
percolation thresholds on the Archimedean lattices for years to come. For
example, for the kagome lattice we find $p_{\rm
c}=0.524\,404\,999\,167\,448\,20 (1)$, whereas the best estimate using standard
techniques is $p_{\rm c}=0.524\,404\,99(2)$. We further provide strong evidence
that there are two classes of lattices: one for which the first three scaling
exponents characterizing the finite-size corrections to $p_{\rm c}$ are
$\Delta=6,7,8$, and another for which $\Delta=4,6,8$. We discuss the open
questions related to the method, such as the full scaling law, as well as its

  higher genus","40 pages, 6 figures",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper aims to contribute to validate, for numerical semigroups of
reasonably large genus, the so-called Conjecture of Wilf. There is no
counter-example for the conjecture among the over 3*10^{10} numerical
semigroups of genus up to 60, as it has been computationally verified by
Fromentin and Hivert. The computations use the idea of parsing a semigroups
tree, making tests in each node. As a mean to combine parsing of the semigroups
tree with known theoretical results, we introduce the concept of cutting
semigroup. Assume that there exists a property on numerical semigroups that
implies that a semigroup satisfying it necessarily satisfies Wilf's conjecture.
Assume also that, besides, this property is hereditary, that is, if a semigroup
satisfies it, then all its descendants in the semigroups tree also have the
same property. Such properties exist. Interesting ones can be easily deduced
from some deep results of Eliahou. A semigroup satisfying such a property is
called a cutting semigroup (for that property). When looking for
counter-examples to Wilf's conjecture, if a cutting semigroup is found, then it
can be cut off, since no counter example lies among its descendants. One can
therefore consider the trimmed tree obtained by cutting off all the cutting
semigroups. Depending on the properties, these ideas allow in some cases to
avoid parsing a very significant part of the tree and can be applied to other
related problems. For instance, they can be used to find all numerical
semigroups with negative Eliahou number up to a genus bigger than 60, which is
the current record. Computations by Fromentin had shown that there are exactly
5 numerical semigroups in these circumstances.

refinement module to refine the elementary feature maps from the ADCPM

framework for uncertainty quantification is applied to the two-step simulation
of the mechanical design of a swirling jet flow generated by a rotating pipe
(\textit{Simulation 1}) impinging on a flat plate to provide convective heat
transfer (\textit{Simulation 2}). The first approach is the Stochastic
Collocation Method (SCM) with Clenshaw-Curtis sparse grids. The conclusion
drawn from the analysis is that the simulated system does not exhibit a
significant sensitivity to stochastic variations of model input parameters,
over the tested uncertainty ranges.
  Additionally, a set of non-linear regression models for the stochastic
velocity and turbulent profiles for the pipe nozzle are created and tested,
since impinging jets at Reynolds number of $Re=23000$ are very frequent in the
literature, but stochastic inlet conditions have never been provided. Numerical
results demonstrate a negligible difference in the predicted convective heat
transfer with respect to the use of the profiles simulated via CFD. These
suggested surrogate models can be directly embedded onto other CFD applications
(e.g arrays of jets or jet flows impinging on plates with different shapes) in
which a realistic swirling flow under uncertainty can be of interest.

flux in this type of semiconductor heterostructures, not only allows to obtain
transport coefficients (electrical and thermal conductivities, and a
Seebeck--like and Peltier--like coefficients), but also to study its operation
as a thermionic generator or as a refrigerator within the context of
irreversible thermodynamics. The existence of the characteristic steady states
that can be reached by any linear energy converter led us to characterize a
family of Seebeck--like coefficients, as well as establish bounds for the
values of a kind of figure of merit $(Tz'_{D,I})$, both associated with the
well-known operating regimes: minimum dissipation function, maximum power

graph-based microstructure model was employed to approximate the efficiency,
measured as short circuit current, of a solar cell given a microstructure.
Through probabilistic graph-based optimization, a class of microstructures were
found with an efficiency surpassing that of more conventional morphologies.
These optimized solar cells surpass the efficiency of more conventional
photovoltaic devices as they better facilitate charge transport, generation,
and dissociation. A device was designed with a 40.29% increase in short circuit
current from the solar cells with the currently believed optimal morphology.
The designed morphologies feature two dendritic clusters of the donor material
poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and the acceptor material
phenyl-C61-Butyric-Acid-Methyl Ester (PCBM). The designed microstructure's
increase in performance contrasts with more conventional structures featuring
interdigitated or bilayer strands of P3HT and PCBM. The change of
microstructure morphology through graph-based evolution obtains an organic
solar cell with an efficiency significantly greater than conventional organic

has been proposed, and studies indicate that ignition in the C-rich central
region makes these viable progenitors for thermonuclear (type Ia) supernovae.
Recent work found that the C-O core is mixed with the surrounding O-Ne as the
white dwarf cools prior to accretion, which results in lower central C
fractions in the massive progenitor than previously assumed. To further
investigate the efficacy of hybrid white dwarfs as progenitors of thermonuclear
supernovae, we performed simulations of thermonuclear supernovae from a new
series of hybrid progenitors that include the effects of mixing during cooling.
The progenitor white dwarf model was constructed with the one-dimensional
stellar evolution code MESA and represented a star evolved through the phase of
unstable interior mixing followed by accretion until it reached conditions for
the ignition of carbon burning. This MESA model was then mapped to a
two-dimensional initial condition for explosions simulated with FLASH. For
comparison, similar simulations were performed for a traditional C-O progenitor
white dwarf. By comparing the yields of the explosions, we find that, as with
earlier studies, the lower C abundance in the hybrid progenitor compared to the
traditional C-O progenitor leads to a lower average yield of 56Ni. Although the
unmixed hybrid WD showed a similar decrement also in total iron group yield,
the mixed case does not and produces a smaller fraction of iron group elements
in the form of 56Ni. We attribute this to the higher central density required
for ignition and the location, center or off-center, of deflagration ignition.

new HGN is called Robotic-HGN (R-HGN), as it matches robot environment
observations to environment labels via fusion of match probabilities from both

addresses robotic observations being pseudo-continuous numbers, rather than
categorical values. Additionally, the proposed approach is memory and
computation-power conservative and thus is acceptable for use in mobile devices
such as single-board computers, which are often used in mobile robotic agents.
This R-HGN approach is validated against individual behaviour implementation
and random behaviour selection. This contrast is made in two sets of simulated
environments: environments designed to challenge the held behaviours of the
R-HGN, and randomly generated environments which are more challenging for the
robotic swarm than R-HGN training conditions. R-HGN has been found to enable
appropriate behaviour selection in both these sets, allowing significant swarm
performance in pre-trained and unexpected environment conditions.

transferred to similar prediction tasks in other domains for which we do not
have enough labeled data. However, as we transition to higher layers in the
model, the representations become more task-specific and less generalizable.
Recent research on deep domain adaptation proposed to mitigate this problem by
forcing the deep model to learn more transferable feature representations
across domains. This is achieved by incorporating domain adaptation methods
into deep learning pipeline. The majority of existing models learn the
transferable feature representations which are highly correlated with the
outcome. However, correlations are not always transferable. In this paper, we
propose a novel deep causal representation learning framework for unsupervised
domain adaptation, in which we propose to learn domain-invariant causal
representations of the input from the source domain. We simulate a virtual
target domain using reweighted samples from the source domain and estimate the
causal effect of features on the outcomes. The extensive comparative study
demonstrates the strengths of the proposed model for unsupervised domain
adaptation via causal representations.

concern in the healthcare system. As drug-drug interactions (DDIs) may lead to

derived using graph convolutions (GC) with a novel attention-based gating
mechanism (holistically called GCA). These representations are then composed in
meaningful ways to handle all subtasks jointly. To overcome scarcity in
training data, we additionally propose transfer learning by pre-training on
related DDI data. Our model is trained and evaluated on the 2018 TAC DDI
corpus. Our GCA model in conjunction with transfer learning performs at 39.20%

The observed population mainly comprises Galactic DNSs (94 per cent), but
detections in the LMC (5 per cent) and SMC (1 per cent) may also be expected.
The median orbital frequency of detected DNSs is expected to be 0.8 mHz, and
many of them will be eccentric (median eccentricity of $0.11$). The orbital
properties will provide insights into DNS progenitors and formation channels.
LISA is expected to localise these DNSs to a typical angular resolution of
$2^\circ$, with best-constrained sources localised to a few arcminutes. These
localisations may allow neutron star natal kick magnitudes to be constrained
through the Galactic distribution of DNSs, and make it possible to follow up
the sources with radio pulsar searches. However, LISA is also expected to
resolve $\sim 10^4$ Galactic double white dwarfs, many of which may have binary
parameters that resemble DNSs; we discuss how the combined measurement of
binary eccentricity, chirp mass, and sky location may aid the identification of
a DNS. We expect the best-constrained DNSs to have eccentricities known to a
few parts in a thousand, chirp masses measured to better than 1 per cent
fractional uncertainty, and sky localisation at the level of a few arcminutes.

framework for controlling the false discovery rate in variable selection. While
empirical results indicate that this methodology is not too conservative, there
is no conclusive theoretical result on its power. When the predictors are
i.i.d. Gaussian, it is known that as the signal to noise ratio tend to
infinity, the knockoff filter is consistent in the sense that one can make FDR
go to 0 and power go to 1 simultaneously. In this work we study the case where
the predictors have a general covariance matrix $\Sigma$. We introduce a simple
functional called effective signal deficiency (ESD) of the covariance matrix
$\Sigma$ that predicts consistency of various variable selection methods. In
particular, ESD reveals that the structure of the precision matrix
$\Sigma^{-1}$ plays a central role in consistency and therefore, so does the
conditional independence structure of the predictors. To leverage this
connection, we introduce Conditional Independence knockoff, a simple procedure
that is able to compete with the more sophisticated knockoff filters and that
is defined when the predictors obey a Gaussian tree graphical models (or when
the graph is sufficiently sparse). Our theoretical results are supported by
numerical evidence on synthetic data.

certain problems, but existing software for differentiable optimization layers
is rigid and difficult to apply to new settings. In this paper, we propose an
approach to differentiating through disciplined convex programs, a subclass of
convex optimization problems used by domain-specific languages (DSLs) for
convex optimization. We introduce disciplined parametrized programming, a
subset of disciplined convex programming, and we show that every disciplined
parametrized program can be represented as the composition of an affine map
from parameters to problem data, a solver, and an affine map from the solver's
solution to a solution of the original problem (a new form we refer to as
affine-solver-affine form). We then demonstrate how to efficiently
differentiate through each of these components, allowing for end-to-end
analytical differentiation through the entire convex program. We implement our
methodology in version 1.1 of CVXPY, a popular Python-embedded DSL for convex
optimization, and additionally implement differentiable layers for disciplined
convex programs in PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0. Our implementation significantly
lowers the barrier to using convex optimization problems in differentiable
programs. We present applications in linear machine learning models and in
stochastic control, and we show that our layer is competitive (in execution

employs an intrinsic likelihood-informed subspace (LIS) (Cui et al., 2014) --
which involves a number of forward and adjoint model simulations -- to design
accelerated operator-weighted proposals. By exploiting the multilevel structure
of the discretised parameters and discretised forward models, we design a
Rayleigh-Ritz procedure to significantly reduce the computational effort in
building the LIS and operating with DILI proposals. Second, the resulting
DILI-MCMC can drastically improve the sampling efficiency of MCMC at each
level, and hence reduce the integration error of the multilevel algorithm for
fixed CPU time. To be able to fully exploit the power of multilevel MCMC and to
reduce the dependencies of samples on different levels for a parallel
implementation, we also suggest a new pooling strategy for allocating
computational resources across different levels and constructing Markov chains
at higher levels conditioned on those simulated on lower levels. Numerical
results confirm the improved computational efficiency of the multilevel DILI

subluminous Type Ia supernovae (SNe) for higher mass progenitors to spectra
that look like Ca-rich transients for lower mass progenitors. This ignition
mechanism produces an inherent relationship between emission features and the
progenitor mass as the ratio of the nebular [Ca II]/[Fe III] emission lines
increases with decreasing white dwarf mass. Examining the [Ca II]/[Fe III]
nebular line ratio in a sample of observed SNe we find further evidence for the
two distinct classes of SNe Ia identified in Polin et al. by their relationship
between Si II velocity and B-band magnitude, both at time of peak brightness.
This suggests that SNe Ia arise from more than one progenitor channel, and
provides an empirical method for classifying events based on their physical
origin. Furthermore, we provide insight to the mysterious origin of Ca-rich

fixed-point integers and specialized activation functions, two aspects that are
not supported by popular Machine Learning frameworks, and the need for these
specialized model representations means that it is hard, and often impossible,
to use e.g., TensorFlow to design, train and test models that later have to be
evaluated securely. Second, we ask to what extent the functionality for
evaluating Neural Networks already exists in general-purpose MPC frameworks.
These frameworks have received more scrutiny, are better documented and
supported on more platforms. Furthermore, they are typically flexible in terms
of the threat model they support. In contrast, most secure evaluation protocols
in the literature are targeted to a specific threat model and their
implementations are only a ""proof-of-concept"", making it very hard for their
adoption in practice. We answer both of the above questions in a positive way:
We observe that the quantization techniques supported by both TensorFlow,
PyTorch and MXNet can provide models in a representation that can be evaluated
securely; and moreover, that this evaluation can be performed by a general
purpose MPC framework. We perform extensive benchmarks to understand the exact
trade-offs between different corruption models, network sizes and efficiency.
These experiments provide an interesting insight into cost between active and
passive security, as well as honest and dishonest majority. Our work shows then
that the separating line between existing ML frameworks and existing MPC

self-education behaviors of type 2 diabetics, namely, information seeking and
information processing, to understand more about how these behaviors affect the
self-management of this common chronic disease. Semi-structured interviews were
conducted with 8 English speaking T2DM patients and qualitative content
analysis techniques were performed to analyze their responses. The information
seeking and processing behaviors vary across individuals based on their
prognosis of T2DM, information needs, and personal preferences. Patients are
often dissatisfied with information from official sources, have difficulty
evaluating the trustworthiness of information sources, and desire information
that is more personally relevant to them. Several participants identified a
lack of personalized information as a key factor in the inability to adhere to
T2DM management guidelines, which led them to experience increased glucose

mentioned that they followed trial and error based approaches to tailor

art for computing Nash equilibria in large two-players zero-sum extensive-form

players' sequential strategy spaces to construct a regret minimizer that
recursively minimizes regret at each decision point in the game tree. In this
paper, we introduce the first efficient regret minimization algorithm for
computing extensive-form correlated equilibria in large two-player general-sum
games with no chance moves. Designing such an algorithm is significantly more
challenging than designing one for the Nash equilibrium counterpart, as the
constraints that define the space of correlation plans lack the hierarchical
structure and might even form cycles. We show that some of the constraints are
redundant and can be excluded from consideration, and present an efficient
algorithm that generates the space of extensive-form correlation plans
incrementally from the remaining constraints. This structural decomposition is
achieved via a special convexity-preserving operation that we coin scaled
extension. We show that a regret minimizer can be designed for a scaled
extension of any two convex sets, and that from the decomposition we then
obtain a global regret minimizer. Our algorithm produces feasible iterates.
Experiments show that it significantly outperforms prior approaches and for
larger problems it is the only viable option.

are accumulated at the corresponding dominant junction initiating device
degradation. Locations of a dominant pn junction, the electric field, and
carrier-density distribution with respect to electron-transport layers in the

device degradation is initiated, which suggests that there exists a strong
correlation between PSC working principle and device degradation. We highlight

this ""temporal correlation bias"". The robustness of our new scheme is tested
against various statistical measures, and we find that temporally correlated
stochasticity generates mock halo data that is significantly more reliable than
that from temporally uncorrelated stochasticity. Our method can be applied for
simulating processes that depend on both the small- and large-scale structures,

antenna array to considerably reduce the number of radio frequency (RF) chains,
but channel estimation is challenging due to the number of RF chains is much
smaller than that of antennas. By exploiting the sparsity of beamspace
channels, the beamspace channel estimation can be formulated as a sparse signal
recovery problem, which can be solved by the classical iterative algorithm
named approximate message passing (AMP), and its corresponding version learned
AMP (LAMP) realized by a deep neural network (DNN). However, these existing
schemes cannot achieve satisfactory estimation accuracy. To improve the channel
estimation performance, we propose a prior-aided Gaussian mixture LAMP
(GM-LAMP) based beamspace channel estimation scheme in this paper.
Specifically, based on the prior information that beamspace channel elements
can be modeled by the Gaussian mixture distribution, we first derive a new
shrinkage function to refine the AMP algorithm. Then, by replacing the original
shrinkage function in the LAMP network with the derived Gaussian mixture
shrinkage function, a prior-aided GM-LAMP network is developed to estimate the

help of graphical representation to explore the accelerated expansion of the
universe. Moreover, the stability of the models are checked through squared
sound speed $v_s^2$. The well-known cosmological plane i.e.,

both mathematically and physically the quantum Planckian context and I provide,
in order to depict quantum fluctuations and in absence of a complete quantum
gravity theory, a semiclassical solution where an effective inhomogeneous
metric at Planckian scales or above is averaged. In such a framework, a
generalization of the well known Buchert formalism \cite{2} is obtained with
the foliation in terms of the mean value $s(\hat{t})$ of the time operator
$\hat{t}$ in a maximally localizing state $\{s\}$ of a quantum spacetime
\cite{3,4,5,6} and in a cosmological context \cite{7}. As a result, after
introducing a decoherence length scale $L_D$ where quantum fluctuations are
averaged on, a classical de Sitter universe emerges with a small cosmological
constant depending on $L_D$ and frozen in a true vacuum state (lowest energy),
provided that the kinematical backreaction is negligible at that scale $L_D$.
Finally, I analyse the case with a non-vanishing initial spatial curvature
$\mathcal{R}$ showing that, for a reasonable large class of models, spatial
curvature and kinematical backreation $\mathcal{Q}$ are suppressed by the
dynamical evolution of the spacetime.

random state of a matrix of perpendicular SOT-MRAMs. Here, we show
experimentally and with micromagnetic simulations that this random state is
driven by the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of the free layer of the memory
excited by the SOT. In detail, a large enough current drives the magnetization
along an in-plane direction. Once the current is removed, the in-plane magnetic
state becomes unstable evolving towards one of the two perpendicular stable
configurations randomly. In addition, an hybrid CMOS/spintronics model is used
to evaluate the electrical characteristics of a PUF realized with an array of
16x16 SOT-MRAM cells. Beyond robustness against voltage and temperature
variations, hardware authentication based on this PUF scheme has additional
advantages over other PUF technologies such as non-volatility (no power
consumption in standby mode), reconfigurability (the secret can be rewritten),
and scalability. We believe that this work is a step forward the design of
spintronic devices for application in security.

paper, we propose a seminal adversarial imitation learning framework for
high-dimension event sequence generation which could be decomposed into: 1) a
latent structural intensity model that estimates the adjacent nodes without

about various subpopulations, formed by demographic and/or geographic
classifications, based on a limited number of samples. Traditional direct
estimates computed using only sampled data from individual subpopulations are
usually unreliable due to small sample sizes. Subpopulations with small samples
are termed small areas or small domains. To improve on the less reliable direct
estimates, model-based estimates, which borrow information from suitable
auxiliary variables, have been extensively proposed in the literature. However,
standard model-based estimates rely on the normality assumptions of the error
terms. In this research we propose a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) method for the
unit-level nested error regression model based on a normal mixture for the
unit-level error distribution. To implement our proposal we use a uniform prior
for the regression parameters, random effects variance parameter, and the
mixing proportion, and we use a partially proper non-informative prior
distribution for the two unit-level error variance components in the mixture.
We apply our method to two examples to predict summary characteristics of farm
products at the small area level. One of the examples is prediction of twelve
county-level crop areas cultivated for corn in some Iowa counties. The other
example involves total cash associated in farm operations in twenty-seven
farming regions in Australia. We compare predictions of small area
characteristics based on the proposed method with those obtained by applying
the Datta and Ghosh (1991) and the Chakraborty et al. (2018) HB methods. Our
simulation study comparing these three Bayesian methods showed the superiority
of our proposed method, measured by prediction mean squared error, coverage
probabilities and lengths of credible intervals for the small area means.

transformed into a bifurcation network via a feed-forward loop which is a
prominent network motif. Utilizing a Gaussian framework, we show that the
feed-forward loop motif harnesses the maximum amount of Shannon mutual
information fractions constructed between the input signaling species and the
final gene product and also between the two downstream gene products. Our

seem to be associated with suicide mortality. However, results are
inconclusive, which might be because dynamics in the social context are not
well-represented by administratively bounded neighbourhoods at baseline. We
used individualized neighbourhoods to examine associations between suicide
mortality, social fragmentation, and deprivation for the total population as
well as by sex and age group. Methods: Using a nested case-control design, all
suicides aged 18-64 years between 2007 and 2016 were selected from longitudinal
Dutch register data and matched with 10 random controls. Indices for social
fragmentation and deprivation were calculated annually for 300, 600, and 1,000
metre circular buffers around each subject's residential address. Results:
Suicide mortality was significantly higher in neighbourhoods with high
deprivation and social fragmentation. Accounting for individual characteristics
largely attenuated these associations. Suicide mortality remained significantly
higher for women living in highly fragmented neighbourhoods in the fully
adjusted model. Age-stratified analyses indicate associations with
neighbourhood fragmentation among women in older age groups (40-64 years) only.
Among men, suicide risk was lower in fragmented neighbourhoods for
18-39-year-olds and for short-term residents. In deprived neighbourhoods, the
suicide risk was lower for 40-64-year-old men and long-term residents.
Associations between neighbourhood characteristics and suicide mortality were
comparable across buffer sizes. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that next to
individual characteristics, the social and economic context within which people
live may both enhance and buffer the risk of suicide.

the black hole one or more times (higher order disk images). For slow-rotating
black holes with a larger plunging region, the effect is not very sensitive to
the exact inclination angle of the disk. For fast-rotating black holes with a
smaller plunging region, the effect is very weak for low inclination angles and
becomes more important as the angle increases. We simulate some observations

detector (mPSD) as a tool in vivo dosimetry in brachytherapy. Methods: A
previously optimized three-point sensor system was used for in vivo HDR
brachytherapy measurements (using the scintillators BCF-60, BCF-12, and
BCF-10). The light detection system of the mPSD consisted of compactly
assembled photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and dichroic mirrors and filters to
achieve a highly sensitive scintillation light collection. The PMT signals were
recorded using a NI-DAQ board at a rate of 100 kHz. Dose measurements covering
a range of 0.5 to 10 cm from the 192Ir source were carried out according to
TG-43 U1 recommendations in order to: (1) characterize the system's response in
terms of angular dependence; (2) obtain the relative contribution of
positioning and measurement uncertainties to the total system uncertainty; (3)
assess the system's temporal resolution; and (4) track the source position in
real time. Results: The positioning uncertainty dominated close to the source,
whereas the measurement uncertainty dominated at larger distances. A maximum
measurement uncertainty of 17 % was observed for the BCF-60 scintillator at 10
cm from the source. The average best compromise between positioning and
measurement uncertainties were reached at 17.4 mm. The detector further
exhibited no angular dependence. The system provided an average location with a
standard deviation under 1.7 mm. The maximum observed differences between
measured and expected source location was 1.82 mm. Dose deviations remained
below 5% in all the explored measurement conditions. With regard to dwell time
measurement accuracy, the maximum deviation observed at all distances was 0.56
s. Conclusions: The performance of the system demonstrated that it could be
used for real-time dose, position and dwell time measurements during HDR
brachytherapy.

coronal heating mechanism. A key quantity is the wave damping rate, $\gamma$,
defined as the ratio of the heating rate to the wave energy.
  Aims: We investigate whether or not laminar phase-mixed Alfv\'en waves can
have a large enough value of $\gamma$ to heat the corona. We also investigate
the degree to which the $\gamma$ of standing Alfv\'en waves which have reached
steady-state can be approximated with a relatively simple equation. Further
foci of this study are the cause of the reduction of $\gamma$ in response to
leakage of waves out of a loop, the quantity of this reduction, and how
increasing the number of excited harmonics affects $\gamma$.
  Results: We find that at observed frequencies $\gamma$ is too small to heat
the corona by approximately three orders of magnitude. Therefore, we believe
that laminar phase mixing is not a viable stand-alone heating mechanism for
coronal loops. We show that $\gamma$ is largest at resonance. We find our
simple equation provides a good estimate for the damping rate (within
approximately 10% accuracy) for resonant field lines. However, away from
resonance, the equation provides a poor estimate, predicting $\gamma$ to be
orders of magnitude too large. We find that leakage acts to reduce $\gamma$ but
plays a negligible role if $\gamma$ is of the order required to heat the
corona. If the wave energy follows a power spectrum with slope -5/3 then
$\gamma$ grows logarithmically with the number of excited harmonics. If the
number of excited harmonics is increased by much more than 100, then the
heating is mainly caused by gradients that are parallel to the field rather
than perpendicular to it. Therefore, in this case, the system is not heated
mainly by phase mixing.

expensive complexity for computing the maximization metric (i.e., a posteriori

particular, quark transversity distributions in the nucleons have very
different properties from the longitudinally-polarized quark distribution
functions, especially in scaling violation, because they are decoupled from the
gluon transversity, due to the fact that they are helicity-flip (chiral-odd)

nucleon spin but also a signature on physics beyond the standard model, because
the electric dipole moment of the neutron is proportional to the transversity
distributions. Now, there is experimental progress on the quark transversity
distributions; however, there is no experimental information on gluon
transversity. In fact, the gluon transversity does not exist for the spin-1/2
nucleon due to the helicity-conservation constraint. One needs a hadron with
spin more than or equal to one, so that the helicity flip of two units is
allowed. A stable spin-1 target is, for example, the deuteron for studying the

can also be quickly computed using hierarchical speedup techniques. They
achieve speed and exactness but sacrifice A*'s flexibility. Extending them to
certain practical applications can be hard. In this paper, we present an

the search for the onset of collective phenomena. Here we present recent
results on short-lived hadronic resonances obtained by the ALICE experiment at

band shifts as well as expansion and shrinking of electron and hole Fermi
surface, respectively. Doping of either element leads to a Lifshitz transition
realized as a removal of one or two hole pockets. This explains qualitatively a
complex behavior of Hall coefficient observed before [Bezusyy, et al., Phys.
Rev. B 91, 100502 (2015)], including change of sign with doping, which takes
place only below room temperature. Assuming that Ni substitution should deliver
twice more electrons to the valence band than Co, it appears that such transfer
is slightly more effective in the case of Co. Therefore, charge doping cannot
account for much stronger effect of Ni on superconducting and transport
properties [Bezusyy, et al., Phys. Rev. B 91, 100502 (2015)]. Although overall
band shifts are roughly proportional to the amount of dopant, clear deviations
from a rigid band shift scenario are found. The shape of electron pockets
becomes elliptical only for Ni doping, effective mass of electron bands
increases with doping, strong reduction of effective mass is observed for one
of hole bands of the undoped system. The topology of hole and electron pockets

helical molecules, is a non-equilibrium effect that emerges from the interplay
between geometrical helicity and spin-orbit interactions. Several model
Hamiltonians building on this interplay have been proposed and while these can
yield spin-polarized transport properties that agrees with experimental
observations, they simultaneously depend on unrealistic values of the
spin-orbit interaction parameters. It is likely, however, that a common deficit
originates from the fact that all these models are uncorrelated, or,
single-electron theories. Therefore, chirality induced spin selectivity is,
here, addressed using a many-body approach, which allows for non-equilibrium
conditions and a systematic treatment of the correlated state. The intrinsic
molecular spin-polarization increases by two orders of magnitudes, or more,
compared to the corresponding result in the uncorrelated model. In addition,
the electronic structure responds to varying external magnetic conditions
which, therefore, enables comparisons of the currents provided for different
spin-polarizations in one of the (or both) leads between which the molecule is
mounted. Using experimentally feasible parameters and room temperature, the
obtained normalized difference between such currents may be as large as 5 - 10
% for short molecular chains, clearly suggesting the vital importance of
including electron correlations when searching for explanations of the
phenomenon.

exploring their individual specific star formation histories (sSFH), we
identified three earlier episodes of strong star formation common to these four
galaxies. We use the last two episodes as markers of the epochs when the
galaxies were crossing. We suggest that after the first turn-around, initially
gas-rich galaxies crossed for the first time, consuming most of their gas.
Hence after the second turn-around most mergers from second crossings would be
mixed or dry. The exception would be gas-rich galaxies intruding for the first
time. Therefore, we suggest that SS galaxies have survived one crossing during
a Hubble time. Strong Balmer absorption lines and the presence of
counter-rotating disks provide independent bounds to the second and first
crossing, respectively. This scenario provides a plausible way out of the short

systems. To reduce the complexity, this letter considers a hybrid digital and
analog (HDA) structure with random frequency mapped into the RF-chains to
achieve SPWT. Then, a hybrid SPWT scheme based on maximizing
signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR) and
artificial-noise-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (ANLNR) (M-SLNR-ANLNR) is proposed.
Compared to the FDB scheme, the proposed scheme reduces the circuit budget with
low computational complexity and comparable secrecy performance.

the internally produced magnetic field of the planet, and have different
rotation periods in the northern and southern hemispheres. In this paper we
study the spatial structure of (near-) planetary period magnetic field
oscillations in Saturn's equatorial magnetosphere. Extending previous analyses
of these phenomena, we include all suitable data from the entire Cassini
mission during its orbital tour of the planet, so as to be able to quantify
both the amplitude and phase of these field oscillations throughout Saturn's
equatorial plane, to distances of 30 planetary radii. We study the structure of
these field oscillations in view of both independently rotating northern and
southern systems, finding spatial variations in both magnetic fields and
inferred currents flowing north-south that are common to both systems. With the
greatly expanded coverage of the equatorial plane achieved during the latter
years of the mission, we are able to present a complete survey of dawn-dusk and
day-night asymmetries in the structure of the oscillating fields and currents.
We show that the general structure of the rotating currents is simpler than
previously reported, and that the relatively enhanced nightside equatorial
fields and currents are due in part to related periodic vertical motion of
Saturn's magnetotail current sheet.

which captures Lipschitz properties of metric subanalytic germs. The main
novelty is to allow ""moderately discontinuous"" chains, which are specially
advantageous for capturing the subtleties of the outer metric phenomena. Our
invariant is a finitely generated graded abelian group $MDH^b_\bullet$ for any
$b\in [1,\infty]$ and homomorphisms $MDH^b_\bullet\to MDH^{b'}_\bullet$ for any
$b\geq b'$. Here $b$ is a ""discontinuity rate"". The homology groups for the
inner or outer metric are proved to be finitely generated and that only
finitely many homomorphisms $MDH^b_\bullet\to MDH^{b'}_\bullet$ are essential.
For $b=1$ it recovers the homology of the tangent cone for the outer metric and
of the Gromov tangent cone for the inner one. In general, for $b=\infty$ the
$MD$- homology recovers the homology of the punctured germ. Hence, our
invariant interpolates from the germ to its tangent cone. Our homology theory
is a bi-Lipschitz subanalitic invariant, is invariant by suitable metric
homotopies, and satisfies versions of the relative and Mayer-Vietoris long
exact sequences. Moreover, fixed a discontinuity rate $b$ we show that it is
functorial for a class of discontinuous Lipschitz maps, whose discontinuities
are $b$-moderated; this makes the theory quite flexible. In the complex
analytic setting we introduce an enhancement called Framed MD Homology, which
takes into account information from fundamental classes. As applications we
prove that Moderately Discontinuous Homology characterizes smooth germs among
all complex analytic germs, recovers the number of irreducible components of
complex analytic germs and the embedded topological type of plane branches.
Framed MD Homology recovers the topological type of any plane curve singularity
and relative multiplicities of complex analytic germs.

affects organism dispersal and guides fundamental ecological interactions.
Below oceanographic mesoscale dynamics, turbulence also impinges on subtle
physical-biological coupling at the single cell level, setting a sea of
chemical gradients and determining microbial interactions with profound effects
on scales much larger than the organisms themselves. It has been only recently
that we have started to disentangle details of this coupling for swimming
microorganisms. However, for non-motile species, which comprise some of the
most abundant phytoplankton groups on Earth, a similar level of mechanistic
understanding is still missing. Here, we explore by means of extensive
numerical simulations the interplay between buoyancy regulation in non-motile
phytoplankton and cellular responses to turbulent mechanical cues. Using a
minimal mechano-response model, we show how such a mechanism would contribute
to spatial heterogeneity and affect vertical fluxes and trigger community
segregation.

due to the stellar spin-down driven by magnetic braking. The evolution of

determining the ages of older cool stars on the main sequence have complicated
such studies for older stars in the past. Here we report on chromospheric Ca II
H and K line measurements for 26 main-sequence cool stars with asteroseismic
ages older than a gigayear and spectral types F and G. We find that for the G

magnetic activity measurements do not show evidence for a stalling of the
magnetic braking mechanism, which has been reported for stellar rotation versus
age for G and F type stars. We also find that the measured R'HK indicator value
for the cool F stars in our sample is lower than predicted by common
age-activity relations that are mainly calibrated on data from young stellar

Gaussian process priors over the spline coefficients across time-series. A
multivariate covariance function in a Gaussian process allows the use of
trichromatic image color variables jointly with spatial locations as inputs to
evaluate the correlation among time-series, and demonstrated the colorimetric

considered on the dynamical properties of connected regions of aligned spins
(domains) after a sudden temperature quench. In equilibrium, it is possible to
resolve the contribution to criticality by the thermal and percolative effects
(on finite lattices, while in the thermodynamic limit they merge at a single
critical temperature) by studying the cluster size heterogeneity,
$H_{\scriptstyle\rm eq}(T)$, a measure of how different the domains are in
size. We here extend this equilibrium measure and study its temporal evolution,
$H(t)$, after driving the system out of equilibrium by a sudden quench in
temperature. We show that this single parameter is able to detect and well
separate the different time regimes, related to the two time scales in the
problem, the short, percolative and the long, coarsening one.

understanding method. It has gained significant interest in a variety of
communities, most notably in robotics and computer graphics. While the advent
of deep learning has progressed the field of 3D object classification, most
work using this data type are solely evaluated on CAD model datasets.
Consequently, current work does not address the discrepancies existing between
real and artificial data. In this work, we examine this gap in a robotic
context by specifically addressing the problem of classification when
transferring from artificial CAD models to real reconstructed objects. This is
performed by training on ModelNet (CAD models) and evaluating on ScanNet
(reconstructed objects). We show that standard methods do not perform well in
this task. We thus introduce a method that carefully samples object parts that
are reproducible under various transformations and hence robust. Using graph
convolution to classify the composed graph of parts, our method significantly
improves upon the baseline.

such as environmental and sustainable problems. Remote sensing data, especially
the nighttime light images, have been widely used to delineate urbanized areas
across the world. Meanwhile, some emerging urban data, such as volunteered
geographical information (e.g., OpenStreetMap) and social sensing data (e.g.,
mobile phone and social media), have also shown great potential in revealing
urban boundaries and dynamics. However, consistent and robust methods to
quantify urban areas from these multi-source data have remained elusive. Here,
we propose a percolation-based method to extract urban areas from these
multi-source urban data. We derive the optimal urban/non-urban threshold by
considering the critical nature of urban systems with the support of the
percolation theory. Furthermore, we apply the method with three open-source
datasets - population, road, and nighttime light - to 28 countries. We show
that the proposed method captures the similar urban characteristics in terms of
urban areas from multi-source data, and Zipf's law holds well in most
countries. The accuracy of the derived urban areas by different datasets has
been validated with the Landsat-based reference data in 10 cities, and the
accuracy can be further improved through data fusion ($\kappa=0.69-0.85$, mean
$\kappa=0.78$). Our study not only provides an efficient method to quantify
urban areas with open-source data, but also deepens the understanding of urban
systems and sheds some light on multi-source data fusion in geographical

maintenance and content consistency. Although some methods have achieved
remarkable success in synthesizing a character with specified style from
standard font, how to map characters to a specified style domain without losing
their identifiability remains very challenging. In this paper, we propose a
novel model named FontGAN, which integrates the character stylization and
de-stylization into a unified framework. In our model, we decouple character
images into style representation and content representation, which facilitates
more precise control of these two types of variables, thereby improving the
quality of the generated results. We also introduce two modules, namely, font
consistency module (FCM) and content prior module (CPM). FCM exploits a
category guided Kullback-Leibler loss to embedding the style representation
into different Gaussian distributions. It constrains the characters of the same
font in the training set globally. On the other hand, it enables our model to
obtain style variables through sampling in testing phase. CPM provides content
prior for the model to guide the content encoding process and alleviates the
problem of stroke deficiency during de-stylization. Extensive experimental
results on character stylization and de-stylization have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our method.

evidencing a standard composition of the BdHN I. This opens the opportunity of
a vaster inquire of the astrophysical nature of their components in the
population synthesis approach: e.g., the BH formation in all BdHN I occurs due
to accretion of the SN ejecta in a tight binary system with a neutron star
companion which reaches its critical mass, leading to the formation of the BH.

as it often involves far extrapolations. In addition, significant discrepancies
between nuclear models in the proton-rich territory call for quantified

trained on separation-energy residuals and combined via Bayesian model
averaging. We obtained a good agreement between averaged predictions of
statistically corrected models and experiment. In particular, we quantified
model results for one- and two-proton separation energies and derived
probabilities of proton emission. This information enabled us to produce a

can coexist by all keeping a steady fraction of the population. Second, these
three strategies can form a cyclic dominance that resembles a

dimensions. Using Lagrange inversion we write down an exact expression for the
value of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling order by order in $\epsilon$ in
terms of the beta function coefficients. The $\epsilon$-expansion is
combinatoric in the sense that the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling at each
order depends on the beta function coefficients via Bell polynomials. Using
certain properties of Lagrange inversion we then argue that the
$\epsilon$-expansion of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling equally well can
be viewed as a geometric expansion which is controlled by the facial structure
of associahedra. We then write down an exact expression for the value of
anomalous dimensions at the Wilson-Fisher fixed point order by order in
$\epsilon$ in terms of the coefficients of the beta function and anomalous
dimensions.
  We finally use our general results to compute the values for the
Wilson-fisher fixed point coupling and critical exponents for the scalar $O(1)$
symmetric model to $O(\epsilon^7)$.

mechanical system, constituted by an oil droplet bouncing on a vibrating fluid
surface, can be induced to display a number of behaviours previously considered
to be distinctly quantum. To explain this correspondence it has been suggested
that the fluid mechanical system provides a single-particle classical model of
de Broglie's idiosyncratic 'double solution' pilot wave theory of quantum
mechanics. In this paper we assess the epistemic function of the bouncing oil
droplet experiments in relation to quantum mechanics. We find that the bouncing
oil droplets are best conceived as an analogue illustration of quantum
phenomena, rather than an analogue simulation, and, furthermore, that their
epistemic value should be understood in terms of how-possibly explanation,
rather than confirmation. Analogue illustration, unlike analogue simulation, is
not a form of 'material surrogacy', in which source empirical phenomena in a
system of one kind can be understood as 'standing in for' target phenomena in a
system of another kind. Rather, analogue illustration leverages a
correspondence between certain empirical phenomena displayed by a source system
and aspects of the ontology of a target system. On the one hand, this limits
the potential inferential power of analogue illustrations, but, on the other,
it widens their potential inferential scope. In particular, through analogue
illustration we can learn, in the sense of gaining how-possibly understanding,
about the putative ontology of a target system via an experiment. As such, the
potential scientific value of these extraordinary experiments is undoubtedly a
significant one.

investigation of strongly correlated electron systems and greatly improved our
understanding of correlation effects in models and materials. In contrast to
Hartree-Fock-type approximations the mean field of DMFT is dynamical, whereby
local quantum fluctuations are fully taken into account. DMFT becomes exact in
the limit of high spatial dimensions or coordination number. Using DMFT the
dynamics of correlated electron systems can be investigated non-perturbatively
at all interaction strengths, electron densities and temperatures. By merging
density functional theory with DMFT a powerful method for the calculation of
the properties of correlated electron materials has become available, which is
applicable to bulk systems and heterostructures, including topological states
of matter. The inclusion of non-local correlations into DMFT makes it possible
to explore unconventional superconductivity and the critical behavior at
thermal or quantum phase transitions. By generalizing DMFT to non-equilibrium
states also the real-time dynamics of correlated systems can be investigated.
In this brief review the foundations and current status of DMFT are discussed
along with characteristic physical insights obtained with this approach.

highlight recent findings from 3D magnetic field reconstructions and

  For interacting current systems, we critically discuss different routes to
coronal dynamics and global eruptions, due to current channel coalescence or to
tilt-kink scenarios. These scenarios involve the presence of two nearby current
channels and are clearly distinct from the popular kink or torus instability.
Since the solar corona is pervaded with myriads of magnetic loops -- creating
interacting flux ropes typified by parallel or antiparallel current channels as
exemplified in various recent observational studies -- coalescence or tilt-kink
evolutions must be very common for destabilizing adjacent flux rope systems.
Since they also evolve on ideal MHD timescales, they may well drive many
sympathetic eruptions witnessed in the solar corona. Moreover, they necessarily
lead to thin current sheets that are liable to reconnection. We review findings
from 2D and 3D MHD simulations for tilt and coalescence evolutions, as well as
on particle acceleration aspects derived from computed charged particle motions
in tilt-kink disruptions and coalescing flux ropes. The latter were recently
studied in two-way coupled kinetic-fluid models, where the complete phase-space

states. For this purpose, we first present an ""all-versus-nothing"" proof of
genuine tripartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering by demonstrating the
non-existence of a hybrid local hidden state (LHS) model in the tripartite
network as a motivation to our main result. A full logical contradiction of the
predictions of the hybrid LHS model with quantum mechanical outcome statistics
for any three-qubit generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GGHZ) states and
pure W-class states is shown. Using logical contradiction, we can distinguish
between the GGHZ and W-class state in a two-sided device-independent (2SDI)
steering scenario. We next formulate a 2SDI steering inequality which is a
generalization of the fine-grained steering inequality (FGI) derived in
\cite{PKM14} for the tripartite scenario. We show that the maximum quantum
violation of this tripartite FGI can be used to certify genuine entanglement of
three-qubit pure states.

on the direct synthesis of tailored graphenic structures by using Plasma
Assisted Chemical Vapour Deposition that present a clean junction with the
prototypical titanium oxide (110) surface. Chemical analysis of the interface

promotes vertical growth of partially oxidized carbon nanodots/rods with
controllable height and density. The deposition with Ar results in continuous
graphenic films with low resistivity (6.8x10-6 ohm x m). The synthesis

changes in temperature and composition occur in both polar regions where a
vortex is in place during the winter. At this season, we observe a global

by means of the Chapman--Enskog method by considering a more general
time-dependent reference state. Due to this choice, the transport coefficients
are given in terms of the solutions of a set of nonlinear differential
equations which must be in general numerically solved. The solution to these
equations gives the transport coefficients in terms of the parameters of the
mixture (masses, diameters, concentration, and coefficients of restitution) and
the time-dependent (scaled) parameter $\xi^*$ which determines the influence of
the thermostat on the system. The Navier--Stokes transport coefficients are
exactly obtained in the special cases of undriven mixtures ($\xi^*=0$) and
driven mixtures under steady conditions ($\xi^*=\xi_\text{st}^*$, where
$\xi_\text{st}^*$ is the value of the reduced noise strength at the steady

significant quantitative differences are specially found in the case of the

different combinations of input factors. This is where mechanistic models
embracing various possibilities find importance. By performing global
uncertainty/sensitivity analysis (UA/SA), one can map out the various outcomes
of the process vs. different combinations of operating conditions. Moreover,
UA/SA allows for the assessment of the model behavior, an inevitable step in
the theoretical understanding of a process. Recently, we developed a coupled
thermodynamic-kinetic framework in the form of population balance modelling in
order to describe the precipitation of calcium-silicate-hydrate. Besides its
relevance in the construction industry, this inorganic nanomaterial offers
potential applications in biomedicine, environmental remediation, and catalysis
most notably due to ample specific surface area that can be achieved by
carefully tuning the synthesis conditions. Here, we apply a global UA/SA to an
improved version of our computational model in order to understand the effect
of variations in the model parameters and experimental conditions (induced by
either uncertainty or tunability) on the properties of the product. With the
specific surface area of particles as an example, we show that UA/SA identifies
the factors whose control would allow a fine-tuning of the desired properties.
This way, we can rationalize the proper synthesis protocol before any further
attempt to optimize the experimental procedure. This approach is general and
can be transferred to other nanoparticle synthesis schemes as well.

such as asteroids and comets are determined to a large degree by the last
global-scale impact or disruption event. Depending on the specific energy,
impacts lead to a large spectrum of outcomes. Sub-catastrophic disruptions take
place in an energy range between cratering impacts and catastrophic
disruptions. Although less energetic than catastrophic events, they can still
significantly alter the overall shape and structure of the target body. This
has been demonstrated recently in the case of bi-lobe cometary nuclei (Jutzi
and Benz, 2017). Here we present results of a subsequent study on the shapes of
asteroids resulting from such collisions. Sizes ranging from a few hundred
meters to a few kilometers are considered.
  We show that impacts on elongated rotating asteroids frequently lead to the
formation of contact binaries. Our results confirm that this mechanism is
robust and works for a large range of asteroid sizes and impact velocities.
Scaling-laws for the prediction of the size and velocity dependent specific
energies required for successful bi-lobe formation are presented. Based on
these scaling laws, the expected frequency of such sub-catastrophic impacts is
calculated and is compared to the one of catastrophic disruptions, which
require much higher specific energies and are more rare.

Vacuum is CPT-symmetric and matter is T-symmetric, the goal is accomplished by

A(CP)=A(CP, T)+A(CP, CPT) for the experimental CPV Asymmetry, with A(CP, T)
genuine T-odd and A(CP, CPT) fake CPT-odd. For the effective Hamiltonian
written as the sum of free mass propagation plus the matter potential for
electron-neutrinos, the two components have definite parities under the
baseline L, the matter potential ""a"", the imaginary part $\sin\delta$ of the
PMNS mixing matrix and the hierarchy ""h""=$\pm 1$ in the neutrino mass ordering:
A(CP, T) is odd in L and $\sin\delta$ plus even in a and h; A(CP, CPT) is even

terrestrial accelerator sources of muon-neutrinos and antineutrinos, the two
components of the appearance CPV asymmetry A(CP) can be disentangled by either
baseline dependence (HKK) or energy dependence (DUNE). At the DUNE baseline,
the higher energy region above the first oscillation node provides a dominant
matter-induced A(CP, CPT) component and the sign of the experimental asymmetry
A(CP) gives the hierarchy in the neutrino mass ordering. On the contrary, there
is a ""magic energy"" E around the second oscillation maximum in which the fake
A(CP, CPT) component has a first-rank zero whereas the genuine A(CP, T)

resolution $\Delta E \sim 200$ MeV an effective zero remains in the

information collected over the lifetime of a claim. This information includes
covariates describing the policy, claim cause as well as the detailed history
collected during a claim's development over time. We present the hierarchical
reserving model as a modular framework for integrating a claim's history and
claim-specific covariates into the development process. Hierarchical reserving
models decompose the joint likelihood of the development process over time.
Moreover, they are tailored to the portfolio at hand by adding a layer to the
model for each of the events registered during the development of a claim (e.g.
settlement, payment). Layers are modelled with statistical learning (e.g.
generalized linear models) or machine learning methods (e.g. gradient boosting
machines) and use claim-specific covariates. As a result of its flexibility,
this framework incorporates many existing reserving models, ranging from
aggregate models designed for run-off triangles to individual models using
claim-specific covariates. This connection allows us to develop a data-driven
strategy for choosing between aggregate and individual reserving; an important
decision for reserving practitioners. We illustrate our method with a case
study on a real insurance data set and deduce new insights in the covariates
driving the development of claims. Moreover, we evaluate the method's
performance on a large number of simulated portfolios representing several
realistic development scenarios and demonstrate the flexibility and robustness

due to the [12CII] line being optically thick, supported by the fact that the
[13CII] line profile is narrower than [12CII], the enhancement varies with
velocity, and the peak velocity of [13CII] matches the [OI] 63um

simple optical depth broadening of the [13CII] line, supporting the scenario of
several PDR components in one beam having varying [12CII] optical depths. The

1. In other words, by varying $p$, $\nu$ can reach an outcome between 0.7112(5)
and 1 (or greater). Furthermore, among the studied values of $p$, all the
associated $\nu$ violate the Harris criterion except the one corresponding to
$p=0.9$. Considering the form of the employed disorder here, the above
described scenario should remain true for other randomness if it is based on
the similar idea as the one used in this study. This is indeed confirmed by our
preliminary results stemming from investigating another disorder distribution.

empirical, and the pharmacokinetic properties of levobupivacaine are not
considered. Here, the pharmacokinetics of levobupivacaine during an
ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane block were evaluated to optimize
dosing regimen, with regard to the between-subject variability and the volume
of levobupivacaine injected.METHOD:The clinical trial (prospective, randomized,
double-blind study protocol) was conducted in 40 children aged 1 to 5 years,
who were scheduled for inguinal surgery. Each patient received 0.4 mg/kg of
levobupivacaine with a volume of local anesthesia solution adjusted to 0.2
mL/kg of 0.2% or 0.4 mL/kg of 0.1% levobupivacaine. Blood samples were
collected at 5, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 60, and 75 min following the block
injection. The population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using the
NONMEM software.RESULTS:From the pharmacokinetic parameters obtained, median
Cmax, tmax, and area under the concentration versus time curve were 0.315 mg/L,
17 min, and 41 mg/L. min, respectively. Between-subject variability (BSV) of
clearance was explained by weight. At the dose regimen of 0.4 mg/kg, none of
the infants showed signs of toxicity, but in 13 patients, transversus abdominis
plane block failed. After analysis, BSV for absorption rate constant,
distribution volume, and clearance were 81%, 47%, and 41%, respectively.
Residual unexplained variability was estimated to be 14%.CONCLUSION:For
improved efficiency in the pediatric population, the dose of levobupivacaine
should be greater than 0.4 mg/kg. Children's weight should be considered to
anticipate any risk of toxicity.

the formulated non-convex QP decoding model. In the proposed QP-ADMM decoder,
complex Euclidean projections onto the check polytope are eliminated and

Moreover, it is proved that the proposed ADMM algorithm converges to a

guaranteed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed designs are demonstrated

from periodic media through a ""cut and project"" procedure. Bloch waves are
typically defined through a direct integral decomposition of periodic
operators. A suitable direct integral decomposition is not available for almost
periodic operators. To remedy this, we lift an almost periodic operator to a
degenerate periodic operator in higher dimensions. Approximate Bloch waves are
obtained for a regularized version of the degenerate equation. Homogenized
coefficients for quasiperiodic media are determined in terms of the first Bloch
eigenvalue of the regularized lifted equation. A notion of quasiperiodic Bloch
transform is defined and employed to obtain homogenization limit for an
equation with highly oscillating quasiperiodic coefficients.

individuals rather than a single person's RT, which is relevant for the
different contexts of social sciences. In doing so, the same model as for the
Ideal Gases (IG) (an inanimate system of non-interacting particles) emerges
from the experimental RT data. Both systems are characterised by a collective
parameter which is k_BT in the case of the system of particles and what we have
called life span parameter for the system of brains. Similarly, we came across
a Maxwell-Boltzmann-type distribution for the system of brains which provides a
natural and more complete characterisation of the collective time response than
has ever been provided before. Thus, we are able to know about the behaviour of
a single individual in relation to the coetaneous group to which they belong
and through the application of a physical law. This leads to a new
entropy-based methodology for the classification of the individuals forming the
system which emerges from the physical law governing the system of brains. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in the literature reporting
on the emergence of a physical theory (IG) from human RT experimental data.

double-diffusive instability along stellar evolution. We determined the surface
Li abundance for a sample of 829 giant stars with accurate Gaia parallaxes for
a large sub-sample (810 stars) complemented with accurate Hipparcos parallaxes
(19 stars). The spectra of our sample of northern and southern giant stars were
obtained in three ground-based observatories (OHP, ESO-La Silla, Mc Donald). We
determined the atmospheric parameters (Teff, log(g), [Fe/H]), and the Li
abundance. We used Gaia parallaxes and photometry to determine the luminosity
of our objects and we estimated the mass and evolution status of each sample
star with a maximum-likelihood technique using stellar evolution models
computed with the STAREVOL code. We compared the observed Li behaviour with
predictions from stellar models, including rotation and thermohaline mixing.
The same approach was used for stars from selected Li surveys from the
literature. Rotation-induced mixing accounts nicely for the lithium behaviour
in stars warmer than about 4200K, independently of the mass domain. For stars
with masses lower than 2Msun thermohaline mixing leads to further Li depletion
below the Teff of the RGB bump (about 4000K), and on the early AGB, as
observed. Depending on the definition we adopt, we find between 0.8 and 2.2% of
Li-rich giants in our new sample. Gaia puts a new spin on the understanding of
mixing processes in stars, and our study confirms the importance of
rotation-induced processes and of thermohaline mixing. However asteroseismology
is required to definitively pinpoint the actual evolution status of Li-rich
giants.

enables the transition from standard data-starved approaches to modern

two mainstream directions. The first one relies on a discrete-continuous
optimization problem and seeks to assign to each material point a point in the
phase space that satisfies compatibility and equilibrium, while being closest
to the data set provided. The second one is a data driven inverse approach that
seeks to reconstruct a constitutive manifold from data sets by manifold
learning techniques, relying on a well-defined functional structure of the
underlying constitutive law. In this work, we propose a third route that
combines the strengths of the two existing directions and mitigates some of
their weaknesses. This is achieved by the formulation of an approximate
nonlinear optimization problem, which can be robustly solved, is
computationally efficient, and does not rely on any special functional
structure of the reconstructed constitutive manifold. Additional benefits
include the natural incorporation of kinematic constraints and the possibility
to operate with implicitly defined stress-strain relations. We discuss
important mathematical aspects of our approach for a data-driven truss element

graph can look at its neighborhood at some distance in the graph and chose its
output. As distributed environment are subject to faults, an important issue is
to be able to check that the output is correct, or in general that the network
is in proper configuration with respect to some predicate. One would like this
checking to be very local, to avoid using too much resources. Unfortunately
most predicates cannot be checked this way, and that is where certification
comes into play. Local certification (also known as proof-labeling schemes,
locally checkable proofs or distributed verification) consists in assigning
labels to the nodes, that certify that the configuration is correct. There are
several point of view on this topic: it can be seen as a part of
self-stabilizing algorithms, as labeling problem, or as a non-deterministic
distributed decision.
  This paper is an introduction to the domain of local certification, giving an
overview of the history, the techniques and the current research directions.

cause harmful effects in developing teenager's brain and health. Additionally,
the use of e-cigarette has a possibility of leading to the use of cigarettes,

cigarette that mostly focused on finding and analyzing causes of smoking using
conventional statistics. However, there is a lack of research on developing
prediction models, which is more applicable to anti-smoking campaign, about
e-cigarette and cigarette. In this paper, we research the prediction models
that can be used to predict an individual e-cigarette user's (including
non-e-cigarette users) intention to smoke cigarettes, so that one can be early
informed about the risk of going down the path of smoking cigarettes. To
construct the prediction models, five machine learning (ML) algorithms are
exploited and tested for their accuracy in predicting the intention to smoke
cigarettes among never smokers using data from the 2018 National Youth Tobacco
Survey (NYTS). In our investigation, the Gradient Boosting Classifier, one of
the prediction models, shows the highest accuracy out of all the other models.
Also, with the best prediction model, we made a public website that enables
users to input information to predict their intentions of smoking cigarettes.

the initial weights of the parametric model. Recent works show that there exist
weight initializations from which optimization procedures can find the
task-specific parameters faster than from uniformly random initializations and
that such a weight initialization can be learned by optimizing a specific model
architecture across similar tasks via MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning).
Current methods are limited to populations of classification tasks that share
the same number of classes due to the static model architectures used during
meta-learning. In this paper, we present HIDRA, a meta-learning approach that
enables training and evaluating across tasks with any number of target
variables. We show that Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning trains a distribution for
all the neurons in the output layer and a specific weight initialization for
the ones in the hidden layers. HIDRA explores this by learning one master
neuron, which is used to initialize any number of output neurons for a new
task. Extensive experiments on the Miniimagenet and Omniglot data sets
demonstrate that HIDRA improves over standard approaches while generalizing to
tasks with any number of target variables. Moreover, our approach is shown to
robustify low-capacity models in learning across complex tasks with a high
number of classes for which regular MAML fails to learn any feasible

lesions in medical imaging. Commonly more than one imaging examination is

remains unused. CNN-based methods have the potential to extract valuable
information from previously acquired imaging to better quantify current imaging
of the same patient. A pre-trained CNN can be updated with a patient's
previously acquired imaging: patient-specific fine-tuning. In this work, we
studied the improvement in performance of lesion quantification methods on MR
images after fine-tuning compared to a base CNN. We applied the method to two
different approaches: the detection of liver metastases and the segmentation of
brain white matter hyperintensities (WMH). The patient-specific fine-tuned CNN
has a better performance than the base CNN. For the liver metastases, the
median true positive rate increases from 0.67 to 0.85. For the WMH
segmentation, the mean Dice similarity coefficient increases from 0.82 to 0.87.
In this study we showed that patient-specific fine-tuning has potential to
improve the lesion quantification performance of general CNNs by exploiting the
patient's previously acquired imaging.

characterise the physical properties of the X-ray emitting plasmas. Methods: We
used all XMM-Newton data up to and including our new observations to produce
the most detailed image yet of the hot ISM plasma in a grand design spiral
galaxy such as our own. We compared the X-ray morphology to multi-wavelength
studies in the literature to set it in the context of the multi-phase ISM. We
performed spectral analyses on the extended emission using our new observations
as they offer sufficient depth and count statistics to constrain the plasma
properties. Data from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury were used to
estimate the energy injected by massive stars and their supernovae. We compared
these results to the hot gas properties. Results: The brightest emission
regions were found to be correlated with populations of massive stars, notably
in the 10 kpc star-forming ring. The plasma temperatures in the ring regions
are ~0.2 keV up to ~0.6 keV. We suggest this emission is hot ISM heated in
massive stellar clusters and superbubbles. We derived X-ray luminosities,
densities, and pressures for the gas in each region. We also found large
extended emission filling low density gaps in the dust morphology of the
northern disk, notably between the 5 kpc and 10 kpc star-forming rings. We
propose that the hot gas was heated and expelled into the gaps by the
populations of massive stars in the rings. Conclusions. It is clear that the
massive stellar populations are responsible for heating the ISM to X-ray
emitting temperatures, filling their surroundings, and possibly driving the hot
gas into the low density regions. Overall, the morphology and spectra of the
hot gas in the northern disk of M 31 is similar to other galaxy disks.

  suggestion",,,,"cs.LG math.ST stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the classical problem of learning rates for classes with finite
VC dimension. It is well known that fast learning rates up to
$O\left(\frac{d}{n}\right)$ are achievable by the empirical risk minimization
algorithm (ERM) if low noise or margin assumptions are satisfied. These usually
require the optimal Bayes classifier to be in the class, and it has been shown
that when this is not the case, the fast rates cannot be achieved even in the
noise free case. In this paper, we further investigate the question of the fast
rates under the misspecification, when the Bayes classifier is not in the class
(also called the agnostic setting).
  First, we consider classification with a reject option, namely Chow's reject
option model, and show that by slightly lowering the impact of hard instances,
a learning rate of order $O\left(\frac{d}{n}\log \frac{n}{d}\right)$ is always
achievable in the agnostic setting by a specific learning algorithm. Similar
results were only known under special versions of margin assumptions. We also
show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is never worse than the
performance of ERM.
  Based on those results, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for
classification (without a reject option) with fast rates in the agnostic
setting achievable by improper learners. This simultaneously extends the work
of Massart and N\'{e}d\'{e}lec (Ann. of Statistics, 2006), which studied this
question in the case where the Bayesian optimal rule belongs to the class, and
the work of Ben-David and Urner (COLT, 2014), which allows the misspecification
but is limited to the no noise setting. Our result also provides the first
general setup in statistical learning theory in which an improper learning
algorithm may significantly improve the learning rate for non-convex losses.

significant attention due to the prospect of bringing genuine computational

machine learning have benefited equally from quantum enhancements. Notably,
deep learning and reinforcement learning, despite their tremendous success in
the classical domain, both individually and combined, remain relatively
unaddressed by the quantum community. Arguably, one reason behind this is the
systematic use in these domains of models and methods without prominent
computational bottlenecks, leaving little room for quantum improvements. In
this work, we study the state-of-the-art neural-network approaches for
reinforcement learning with quantum enhancements in mind. We demonstrate the
substantial learning advantage that models with a sampling bottleneck can
provide over conventional neural network architectures in complex learning
environments. These so-called energy-based models, like deep energy-based
reinforcement learning, and deep projective simulation that we also introduce
in this work, effectively allow to trade off learning performance for
efficiency of computation. To alleviate the additional computational costs, we
propose to leverage future and near-term quantum algorithms, resulting in
overall more advantageous learning algorithms. This is achieved using
cutting-edge and new quantum computing machinery to speed-up classical sampling
methods and by employing generalized models to gain an additional quantum
advantage.

dislocations are represented by a set of vector density fields, one per
crystallographic slip systems. The space-time evolution of these densities is
obtained by solving a set of dislocation transport equations coupled with
crystal mechanics. Here, we present an approach for incorporating dislocation
annihilation and junction reactions into the dislocation transport equations.
These reactions consume dislocations and result in nothing as in the
annihilation reactions, or produce new dislocations of different types as in
the case of junction reactions. Collinear annihilation, glissile junctions, and
sessile junctions are particularly emphasized here. A generalized energy-based
criterion for junction reactions is established in terms of the dislocation
density and Burgers vectors of the reacting species, and the reaction rate
terms for junction reactions are formulated in terms of the dislocation
densities. In order to illustrate how the dislocation network changes as a
result of junction formation and annihilation in a continuum dislocation
dynamics setting, we present some numerical examples focusing on the reactions
processes themselves. The results show that our modeling approach is able to
capture the respective dislocation network changes associated with dislocation
reactions in FCC crystals: dislocations of opposite line directions
encountering each other on collinear slip systems annihilate to connect the
dislocations on the two slip systems, glissile junctions form on new slip
system behave like Frank-Read sources, and sessile junctions form and expand
along the intersection of the slip planes of the reacting dislocation species.
A collective-dynamics test showing the frequency of occurrence of junctions of
different types relative to each other is also presented.

network delay and the AoI in a multi-hop satellite network that relays status
updates from satellite 1, receiving uplink traffic from ground devices, to
satellite K, using K-2 intermediate satellite nodes. The last node, K, is the
closest satellite with connectivity to a ground station. The satellite
formation is modeled as a queue network of M/M/1 systems connected in series.
The scenario is then generalized for the case in which all satellites receive
uplink traffic from ground, and work at the same time as relays of the packets
from the previous nodes. The results show that the minimum average AoI is
experienced at a decreasing system utilization when the number of nodes is
increased. Furthermore, unloading the first nodes of the chain reduces the
queueing time and therefore the average AoI. These findings provide insights
for designing multi-hop satellite networks for latency-sensitive applications.

constrain the properties of the mass assembly history of the Milky Way (MW) and
Andromeda (M31) galaxies. These objects have been obtained using the
constrained simulation technique, which ensures that simulated LGs live within
a large scale environment akin to the observed one. Our results are compared
against a standard $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) series of
simulations which use the same cosmological parameters. This allows us to
single out the effects of the constraints on the results. We find that (a) the
median constrained merging histories for M31 and MW live above the standard
ones at the 1-$\sigma$ level, (b) the median formation time takes place
$\approx$ 0.5 Gyr earlier than unconstrained values, while the latest major
merger happens on average 1.5 Gyr earlier and (c) the probability for both LG
haloes to have experienced their last major merger in the first half of the
history of the Universe is $\approx$ 50% higher for the constrained pairs.
These results have been estimated to be significant at the 99% confidence level
by means of a Kolmogorov-Simirnov test. These results suggest that the
particular environment in which the Milky Way and Andromeda form plays a role
in shaping their properties, and favours earlier formation and last major
merger time values in agreement with other observational and theoretical
considerations.

embedded in a uniform elastic matrix. Given the core and matrix properties, we
answer the questions of how to select the shell material such that (i) it acts
as a static elastic cloak, and (ii) it eliminates low frequency scattering of
incident elastic waves. It is shown that static cloaking (i) requires an
anisotropic shell, whereas scattering reduction (ii) can be satisfied more
simply with isotropic materials. Implicit solutions for the shell material are
obtained by considering the core-shell composite cylinder as a neutral elastic
inclusion. Two types of neutral inclusion are distinguished, \textit{weak} and
\textit{strong} with the former equivalent to low frequency transparency {and
the classical Christensen and Lo generalised self-consistent result for
in-plane shear from 1979. Our introduction of the \textit{strong neutral
inclusion} is an important extension of this result in that we show that
standard anisotropic shells can act as perfect static cloaks, contrasting
previous work that has employed ""unphysical"" materials.} The relationships
between low frequency transparency, static cloaking and neutral inclusions
provide the material designer with options for achieving elastic cloaking in

they vary within and between species and individuals? Why do we prefer some
things over others? MEDO is a theoretical framework for understanding these
questions in abstract terms, as well as for generating and evaluating specific
hypotheses that seek to explain goal-oriented behavior. MEDO views preferences
as selective pressures influencing the likelihood of particular outcomes. With
respect to biological organisms, these patterns must compete and cooperate in
shaping system evolution. To the extent that shaping processes are themselves
altered by experience, this enables feedback relationships where histories of
reward and punishment can impact future motivation. In this way, various biases
can undergo either amplification or attenuation, resulting in preferences and
behavioral orientations of varying degrees of inter-temporal and
inter-situational stability. MEDO specifically models all shaping dynamics in
terms of natural selection operating on multiple levels--genetic, neural, and
cultural--and even considers aspects of development to themselves be
evolutionary processes. Thus, MEDO reflects a kind of generalized Darwinism, in
that it assumes that natural selection provides a common principle for
understanding the emergence of complexity within all dynamical systems in which
replication, variation, and selection occur. However, MEDO combines this
evolutionary perspective with economic decision theory, which describes both
the preferences underlying individual choices, as well as the preferences
underlying choices made by engineers in designing optimized systems. In this
way, MEDO uses economic decision theory to describe goal-oriented behaviors as
well as the interacting evolutionary optimization processes from which they
emerge. (Please note: this manuscript was written and finalized in 2012.)

  simulation of transitional and turbulent flows",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new methodology based on energy flux similarity is suggested in this paper
for large eddy simulation (LES) of transitional and turbulent flows. Existing
knowledge reveals that the energy cascade generally exists in transitional and
turbulent flows with different distributions, and the characteristic quantity
of scale interaction in energy cascade processes is energy flux. Therefore,
energy flux similarity is selected as the basic criterion to secure the flow
field getting from LES highly similar to the real flow field. Through a priori
tests, we find that the energy flux from the tensor-diffusivity (TD) model has
high similarity with the real energy flux. Then, we modify the modelled energy
flux from the TD model and obtain uniform formulas of energy flux similarity
corresponding to different filter widths and locations in the wall-bounded
turbulence. To secure the robustness of simulation and the LES results similar
to the real flow, we apply the energy flux similarity method (EFSM) to the
Smagorinsky model in the LES of compressible turbulent channel flow,
compressible flat-plate flow, and flow over a compressible ramp. The a
posteriori tests show that, overall, EFSM can better predict these flows than
other subgrid-scale models. In the simulation of turbulent channel flow, EFSM
can accurately predict the mean stream-wise velocity, Reynolds stress, and
affluent coherent structures. In LES of compressible flat-plate flow, EFSM
could provide accurate simulation results of the onset of transition and
transition peak, skin friction, and mean stream-wise velocity in cases with
three different grid scales. Meanwhile, for flow over a compressible ramp, EFSM
could correctly describe the process of bypass transition, locations of
separation and reattachment in the corner region, and abundant coherent vortex
structures, etc.

result of the first stage, the present paper summarizes the efforts into the
creation of a digital database of field data from several thousands of
multistage HF jobs on wells from circa 20 different oilfields in Western
Siberia, Russia. In terms of the number of points (fracturing jobs), the

an axionic coupling of the inflaton leads to an explicit model for the thermal
bath, yields models of inflation that can easily fit cosmological observations
while satisfying de Sitter swampland bounds, as well as the swampland distance
bound and trans-Planckian censorship.

which involves both a linear as well as a quadratic term in the momentum. From
this we have obtained the corresponding modified dispersion relation which is
compared with the corresponding relation in rainbow gravity. The new form of
the generalized uncertainty principle reduces to the known forms in appropriate
limits. We then calculate the modified velocity of photons and we find that it
is energy dependent, allowing therefore for a superluminal propagation. We then
derive the $1+1$-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation taking into account the
effects of the modified dispersion relation. The positive frequency mode
solution of this equation is then used to calculate the power spectrum arising
due to the Unruh effect. The result shows that the power spectrum depends on
the energy of the particle owing its origin to the presence of the generalized
uncertainty principle. Our results capture the effects of both the simplest
form as well as the linear form of the generalized uncertainty principle and
also points out an error in the result of the power spectrum up to first order
in the generalized uncertainty principle parameter existing in the literature.

applications ranging from targeted drug delivery to lab-on-a-chip systems.
Previously, Janus particles (JPs), acting as mobile microelectrodes have been
shown to transport cargo which is trapped by a dielectrophoretic mechanism
[Boymelgreen et al. (2018)]. Herein, we aim to characterize the cargo loading
properties of mobile Janus carriers, across a broad range of frequencies and
voltages. In expanding the frequency range of the carrier, we are able to
compare the influence of different modes of carrier transport on the loading
capacity as well as highlight the differences between cargo trapped by positive
and negative dielectrophoresis. Specifically it is shown that cargo trapping
results in a reduction in carrier velocities with this effect more pronounced
at low frequencies where cargo is trapped close to the substrate.
Interestingly, we observe the existence of a maximum cargo loading capacity
which decreases at large voltages suggesting a strong interplay between
trapping and hydrodynamic shear. Finally, we demonstrate that control of the
frequency can enable different assemblies of binary colloidal solutions on the
JP. The resultant findings enable the optimization of electrokinetic cargo
transport and its selective application to a broad range of targets.

challenges to global health. The development of new antimicrobial treatments
such as antimicrobial peptides needs to be accelerated to combat this threat.
However, the discovery of novel antimicrobial peptides is hampered by
low-throughput biochemical assays. Computational techniques can be used for
rapid screening of promising antimicrobial peptide candidates prior to testing
in the wet lab. The vast majority of existing antimicrobial peptide predictors
are non-targeted in nature, i.e., they can predict whether a given peptide
sequence is antimicrobial, but they are unable to predict whether the sequence
can target a particular microbial species. In this work, we have developed a
targeted antimicrobial peptide activity predictor that can predict whether a
peptide is effective against a given microbial species or not. This has been
made possible through zero-shot and few-shot machine learning. The proposed
predictor called AMP0 takes in the peptide amino acid sequence and any
N/C-termini modifications together with the genomic sequence of a target
microbial species to generate targeted predictions. It is important to note
that the proposed method can generate predictions for species that are not part
of its training set. The accuracy of predictions for novel test species can be
further improved by providing a few example peptides for that species. Our
computational cross-validation results show that the pro-posed scheme is
particularly effective for targeted antimicrobial prediction in comparison to
existing approaches and can be used for screening potential antimicrobial
peptides in a targeted manner especially for cases in which the number of
training examples is small. The webserver of the method is available at
http://ampzero.pythonanywhere.com.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Today, deployment of optical fiber has offered large transmission capacity
which cannot be efficiently utilized by the electronic switches. Rather,
Integrated Hybrid Optical Network (IHON) is a promising approach which combines
both packet and circuit switching techniques. As a result, it achieves
efficient utilization of the bulk capacity and guarantees absolute Quality of
Service (QoS) by optimizing the advantages of the two switching schemes while
diminishing their disadvantages. Transpacket has developed a Fusion node
implementing IHON principles in Ethernet for the data plane. Hence, this paper
investigates and evaluates IHON network for 5G access networks. The simulated
results and numerical analysis confirm that the Packet Delay Variation (PDV),
Delay and Packet Loss Ratio (PLR) of Guaranteed Service Transport. (GST)
traffic in IHON network met the requirements of 5G mobile fronthaul using CPRI.
The number of nodes in the network limits the maximum separation distance
between Base Band Unit. (BBU) and Remote Radio Head (RRH), link length; for
increasing the number of nodes, the link length decreases. In addition to this,
we verified how the leftover capacity of fusion node can be used to carry the
low priority packets and how the GST traffic can have deterministic
characteristics on a single wavelength by delaying it with Fixed Delay Line
(FDL). For example, for LSM 1GE=0.3 the added Statistical Multiplexing (SM)
traffic increases the 10GE wavelength utilization up to 89% without any losses
and with SM PLR=0.001 up to 92% utilization.
