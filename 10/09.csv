quantum computation to be performed on one party's private data with the

(interactive) QHE based on the universal circuit approach. It contains a
subprocedure of calculating a classical linear polynomial, which can be
implemented with quantum or classical methods; apart from the subprocedure, the
framework has low requirement on the quantum capabilities of the party who
provides the circuit. We illustrate the subprocedure using a quite simple
classical protocol with some privacy tradeoff. For a special case of such
protocol, we obtain a scheme similar to blind quantum computation but with the
output on a different party. Another way of implementing the subprocedure is to
use a recently studied quantum check-based protocol, which has low requirement
on the quantum capabilities of both parties. The subprocedure could also be
implemented with a classical additive homomorphic encryption scheme. We
demonstrate some key steps of the outer part of the framework in a quantum

honeycomb Schroedinger operator, which is periodic with respect to the
triangular lattice, invariant under parity, P, and complex-conjugation, C. A
honeycomb operator has Dirac points: two dispersion surfaces touch conically at
an energy level, $E_D$ [25,27]. Periodic perturbations which break P or C open
a gap in the essential spectrum about energy $E_D$. Such operators model an
insulator near energy $E_D$. Our edge operator is a small perturbation of the
bulk and models a transition (via a domain wall) between distinct periodic, P
or C breaking perturbations. The edge operator permits energy transport along
the line-defect. The associated energy channels are called edge states. They
are time-harmonic solutions which are localized near and propagating along the
line-defect. We completely characterize the edge state spectrum within the bulk
spectral gap about $E_D$. At the center of our analysis is an expansion of the
edge operator resolvent for energies near $E_D$. The leading term features the
resolvent of an effective Dirac operator. Edge state eigenvalues are poles of
the resolvent, which bifurcate from the Dirac point. The corresponding
eigenstates have the multiscale structure identified in [23]. We extend earlier
work on zigzag-type edges [14] to all rational edges. We elucidate the role in
edge state formation played by the type of symmetry-breaking and the

relies on accurate measurement of deformation, which is experimentally
challenging. To avoid measuring deformation, we propose a hydrodynamic bulge
test for characterizing the material properties of thick, pre-stressed elastic
sheets via their fluid--structure interaction with a steady viscous fluid flow.
Specifically, the hydrodynamic bulge test relies on a pressure drop measurement
across a rectangular microchannel with a deformable top wall. We develop a
mathematical model using first-order shear-deformation theory of plates with
stretching, and the lubrication approximation for Newtonian fluid flow.
Specifically, a relationship is derived between the imposed flow rate and the
total pressure drop. Then, this relationship is inverted numerically to yield
estimates of the Young's modulus (given the Poisson ratio), if the pressure
drop is measured (given the steady flow rate). Direct numerical simulations of
two-way-coupled fluid--structure interaction are carried out in ANSYS to
determine the cross-sectional membrane deformation and the hydrodynamic
pressure distribution. Taking the simulations as ``ground truth,'' a
hydrodynamic bulge test is performed using the simulation data to ascertain the
accuracy and validity of the proposed methodology for estimating material
properties. An error propagation analysis is performed via Monte Carlo
simulation to characterize the susceptibility of the hydrodynamic bulge test
estimates to noise. We find that, while a hydrodynamic bulge test is less
accurate in characterizing material properties, it is less susceptible to
noise, in the input (measured) variable, than a hydrostatic bulge test.

Diverse teams are needed to build trustworthy artificial intelligent systems,
and those teams need to coalesce around a shared set of ethics. There are many
discussions in the AI field about ethics and trust, but there are few
frameworks available for people to use as guidance when creating these systems.
The Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) Framework for Designing Ethical AI Experiences
described in this paper, when used with a set of technical ethics, will guide
AI development teams to create AI systems that are accountable, de-risked,
respectful, secure, honest, and usable. To support the team's efforts,
activities to understand people's needs and concerns will be introduced along
with the themes to support the team's efforts. For example, usability testing
can help determine if the audience understands how the AI system works and
complies with the HMT Framework. The HMT Framework is based on reviews of
existing ethical codes and best practices in human-computer interaction and
software development. Human-machine teams are strongest when human users can
trust AI systems to behave as expected, safely, securely, and understandably.
Using the HMT Framework to design trustworthy AI systems will provide support
to teams in identifying potential issues ahead of time and making great

redundant hardware and full tolerance capability which is an important
advantage of the proposed topology. Moreover, the most important advantages of
the proposed topology are a fast response in a fault condition and low cost of
the converter in comparison with the evaluated topologies. A
Joule-integral-based method for selecting an appropriate rating of applied
fuses has been presented to provide a reliable fault-isolation operation. Also,
a comparison with currently available fault-tolerant dc-ac converters is given
to show the merits of the proposed topology. Finally, the experimental results

marked by the $T^*$ line in the doping-temperature phase diagram, which ends at
a point $p^*$ at zero temperature within the superconducting dome. Although
various theoretical and experimental studies indicate a competition between the
pseudogap and superconductivity, there is no general consensus on the effects
of the pseudogap within the superconducting phase. We use cluster dynamical
mean field theory on a three-band Hubbard model for the HTSC to study the
superconducting phase at $T=0$, obtained when doping the charge-transfer
insulator, for several values of $U$. We observe a first-order transition
within the superconducting phase, which separates the underdoped and overdoped
solutions. The transition to the underdoped solution is marked by a
discontinuous increase in the spectral gap, and on further underdoping the
spectral gap increases while the superconducting order parameter decreases. We
conclude that this is due to the onset of the pseudogap in the underdoped
region, which contributes to the increasing spectral gap; this is further
consistent with the appearance of a pole in the normal component of the
self-energy, in the antinodal region, in the underdoped solution. This is
accompanied by a change in the source of the condensation energy from potential
energy, in the overdoped region, to kinetic energy in the underdoped region.
Further, we also observe that the $d$-wave node vanishes smoothly within the
superconducting phase at low values of hole doping, within the underdoped
region. We see this as a manifestation of Mott physics operating at very low
doping. Various aspects of the results and their implications are discussed.

the photosphere. By using these photospheric measurements as boundary
condition, we developed the magnetohydrostatic (MHS) extrapolation to model the
solar atmosphere. The model makes assumption about the relative importance of
magnetic and non-magnetic forces. While the solar corona is force-free, this is
not the case in photosphere and chromosphere.
  Aim. The model has been tested with an exact equilibria in \cite{zw18}. Here
we present a more challenging and realistic test of our model with radiative
MHD simulation of a solar flare.
  Methods. By using the optimization method, the MHS model computes
self-consistently the magnetic field, plasma pressure and density. The
nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) and gravity stratified atmosphere along the
field line are assumed as the initial condition of the optimization.
  Results. Compared with NLFFF, the MHS model gives an improved magnetic field
not only in magnitude and direction, but also in the magnetic connectivity.
Besides, the MHS model is able to recover the main structure of the plasma in
the photosphere and chromosphere.

PRODIGE: a method that learns a weighted graph representation of data

parameter regimes which are relevant for the physics of the high-$T_c$
superconducting cuprates. Unlike previous attempts to attack this problem, our
new approach takes into account all fluctuations in different channels on equal
footing and is able to treat reasonable large lattice sizes up to 32x32. This
is achieved by the following three-step procedure: (i) We transform the
original problem to a new representation (dual fermions) in which all purely
local correlation effects from the dynamical mean field theory are already
considered in the bare propagator and bare interaction of the new problem. (ii)
The strong $1/(i\nu)^2$ decay of the bare propagator allows us to integrate out
all higher Matsubara frequencies besides the lowest using low order diagrams.
The new effective action depends only on the two lowest Matsubara frequencies
which allows us to, (iii) apply the two-particle self-consistent parquet
formalism, which takes into account the competition between different
low-energy bosonic modes in an unbiased way, on much finer momentum grids than
usual. In this way, we were able to map out the phase diagram of the 2D Hubbard
model as a function of temperature and doping. Consistently with the
experimental evidence for hole-doped cuprates and previous dynamical cluster
approximation calculations, we find an antiferromagnetic region at low-doping
and a superconducting dome at higher doping. Our results also support the role
of the van Hove singularity as an important ingredient for the high value of
$T_c$ at optimal doping. At small doping, the destruction of antiferromagnetism
is accompanied by an increase of charge fluctuations supporting the scenario of
a phase separated state driven by quantum critical fluctuations.

refining Vybiral's result to lower-bound $M \circ N$, for arbitrary complex

the chemical enrichment across a galaxy. We study the azimuthal variations of
the normalized oxygen abundance profiles in the highest numerical resolution

Project at $z=0$. We use young stellar populations to trace the abundances of
star-forming regions. Oxygen profiles are estimated along different line of
sights from a centrally located observer.The mean azimuthal variation in the
EAGLE discs are $\sim 0.12 \pm 0.03$~dex~$R_{\rm eff}^{-1}$ for slopes and
$\sim 0.12 \pm 0.03$~dex for the zero points, in agreement with previous works.
Metallicity gradients measured along random directions correlate with those
determine by averaging over the whole discs although with a large dispersion.
We find a slight trend for higher azimuthal variations in the disc components
of low star-forming and bulge-dominated galaxies. We also investigate the
metallicity profiles of stellar populations with higher and lower levels of
enrichment than the average metallicity profiles, and we find that high
star-forming region with high metallicity tend to have slightly shallower
metallicity slopes compared with the overall metallicity gradient. The
simulated azimuthal variations in the EAGLE discs are in global agreement with
observations, although the large variety of metallicity gradients would
encourage further exploration of the metal mixing in numerical simulations.

selects a value from a candidate-value list for each target slot, while an
ontology-free method extracts spans from dialog contexts. Recent work
introduced a BERT-based model to strike a balance between the two methods by
pre-defining categorical and non-categorical slots. However, it is not clear
enough which slots are better handled by either of the two slot types, and the
way to use the pre-trained model has not been well investigated. In this paper,
we propose a simple yet effective dual-strategy model for DST, by adapting a
single BERT-style reading comprehension model to jointly handle both the
categorical and non-categorical slots. Our experiments on the MultiWOZ datasets
show that our method significantly outperforms the BERT-based counterpart,
finding that the key is a deep interaction between the domain-slot and context

settings, our method performs competitively and robustly across the two
different settings. Our method sets the new state of the art in the noisy
setting, while performing more robustly than the best model in the cleaner
setting. We also conduct a comprehensive error analysis on the dataset,
including the effects of the dual strategy for each slot, to facilitate future

demonstrate that for $n < 1/2$, the primordial curvature perturbations are

the perturbation modes exit the horizon at a large negative time during the
contraction era, which in turn makes the ``low-curvature'' regime, the era for
which the calculations of observational indices related to the primordial power

the Lagrange multiplier $F(R)$ gravity, we construct the form of effective
$F(R)$ gravity that can realize such a cosmological evolution, and we determine
the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations. Accordingly, we
calculate the spectral index of the primordial curvature perturbations and the
tensor-to-scalar ratio, and we confront these with the latest observational
data. We also address the issue of stability of the primordial metric
perturbations, and to this end, we determine the form of $F(R)$ which realizes
the non-singular cosmology for the whole range of cosmic time $-\infty < t <

order reconstructions is surely beneficial for their non oscillatory
properties, but may bring loss of accuracy on smooth data unless special care
is exerted. In this paper we address this issue with a new Central WENOZ
(CWENOZ) approach, in which the reconstruction polynomial is computed from a
single set of non linear weights, but the linear weights of the polynomials
with very low degree (compared to the final desired accuracy) are infinitesimal
with respect to the grid size. After proving general results that guide the
choice of the CWENOZ parameters, we study a concrete example of a
reconstruction that blends polynomials of degree six, four and two, mimicking
already published Adaptive Order WENO reconstructions [Balsara, Garain and Shu,
J.Comput.Phys., 2016], [Arbogast, Huang and Zhao, SIAM J.Numer.Anal., 2018].
The novel reconstruction yields similar accuracy and oscillations with respect
to the previous ones, but saves up to 20% computational time since it does not
rely on a hierarchic approach and thus does not compute multiple sets of
nonlinear weights in each cell.

This is based on reinterpreting the latter equation and its solutions which are

Yang-Baxter equation whose solutions are given by quadrirational Yang-Baxter
maps. The Yang-Baxter maps obtained through this approach are found to satisfy
two different types of Yang-Baxter equations, one that is the usual equation

Apart from the elliptic case, each of these Yang-Baxter maps are
quadrirational, but only maps that solve the former type of Yang-Baxter

two-component variables, and two-component parameters, and have a natural
QRT-like composition of separate maps for each component. Through this

catalogues with different numbers of lenses distributed up to redshift $z\sim
1$ and focusing on cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant $H_0$
and parametrisations of the dark energy equation of state. We also explore the
impact of our ability to precisely model the lens mass profile and its
environment, on the forecasted constraints. We find that in the most optimistic
cases, SLTD will constrain $H_0$ at the level of $\sim 0.1\%$, while the CPL
equation of state parameters, $w_0$ and $w_a$, can be determined with errors
$\sigma_{w_0}\sim 0.05$ and $\sigma_{w_a}\sim 0.3$, respectively. Furthermore,
we investigate the bias introduced when a wrong cosmological model is assumed
for the analysis. We find that the value of $H_0$ could be biased up to $10
\sigma$, assuming a perfect knowledge of the lens profile, when a $\Lambda$CDM
model is used to analyse data that really belong to a $w$CDM cosmology with

observed towards quasar ULAS J0148+0600. One possibility is that the most
opaque regions at these redshifts contain significant amounts of neutral
hydrogen. This explanation, which abandons the common assumption that
reionization ended before $z=6$, also reconciles evidence from independent
observations of a significantly neutral Universe at $z=7.5$. Here we explore a
model in which the neutral fraction is still $\approx 10\%$ at $z=5.5$. We
confirm that this model can account for the observed scatter in Ly$\alpha$
forest opacities, as well as the observed Ly$\beta$ transmission in the J0148
trough. We contrast the model with a competing ""earlier"" reionization scenario
characterized by a short mean free path and large fluctuations in the
post-reionization ionizing background. We consider Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$
effective optical depths, their correlations, trough size distributions, dark
pixel fractions, the IGM thermal history, and spatial distributions of
Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters around forest sight lines. We find that the models are
broadly similar in almost all of these statistics, suggesting that it may be
difficult to distinguish between them definitively. We argue that improved
constraints on the mean free path and the thermal history at $z>5$ could go a
long way towards diagnosing the origin of the $z>5.5$ opacity fluctuations.

In the advent of new infrared, high-resolution spectrometers,
accurate and precise atomic data in the infrared is urgently needed.
Identifications, wavelengths, strengths, broadening and hyper-fine splitting
parameters of stellar lines in the near-IR are in many cases not accurate
enough to model observed spectra, and in other cases even non existing. Some
stellar features are unidentified. Aims. The aim with this work is to identify
a spectral feature at lambda(vac) = 1063.891 nm or lambda(air) = 1063.600 nm
seen in spectra of stars of different spectral types, observed with the GIANO-B
spectrometer. Methods. Searching for spectral lines to match the unidentified
feature in linelists from standard atomic databases was not successful.
However, by investigating the original, published laboratory data we were able
to identify the feature and solve the problem. To confirm its identification,
we model the presumed stellar line in the solar intensity spectrum and find an
excellent match. Results. We find that the observed spectral feature is a
stellar line originating from the 4s'-4p' transition in S I, and that the
reason for its absence in atomic line databases is a neglected air-to-vacuum
correction in the original laboratory measurements from 1967 for this line
only. From interpolation we determine the laboratory wavelength of the S I line
to be lambda(vac) = 1063.8908 nm or lambda(air) = 1063.5993 nm, and the
excitation energy of the upper level to be 9.74978 eV.

supported against gravity by magnetic fields and cosmic rays, is thought to be
dynamically important for galaxy evolution, possibly promoting molecular cloud
formation and the galactic dynamo. In previous work, we examined the effect of
three different cosmic ray transport models on the Parker instability:
decoupled ($\gamma_c = 0$), locked to the thermal gas ($\gamma_c = 4/3$) and
coupled to the gas with streaming by self-confinement. We expand upon that work
here by considering radiative cooling, a smooth gravitational potential, and
simulations into the nonlinear regime. We determine that cosmic ray transport
away from compression points, whether by diffusion or streaming, is the largest
driver of the instability. Heating due to cosmic ray streaming is also
destabilizing and especially affects the nonlinear regime. While cooling
de-pressurizes the dense gas, streaming cosmic rays heat and inflate the
diffuse extraplanar gas, greatly modifying the phase structure of the medium.
In 3D, we find that the fastest growth favors short wavelength modes in the
horizontal direction perpendicular to the background magnetic field; this is
imprinted on Faraday rotation measure maps that may be used to detect the
Parker instability. The modifications to the Parker instability that we observe
in this work have large implications for the structure and evolution of
galaxies, and they highlight the major role that cosmic rays play in shaping
their environments.

drives a quantum phase transition to an easy-plane antiferromagnet, which is
described by a Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons. Using a combination of
field theoretical techniques and density matrix renormalization group
calculations we demonstrate that in one dimension this transition is stable in
the presence of a metallic Fermi sea and its universality class in the local
magnetic response is unaffected by the itinerant gapless fermions. Moreover, we
find that fluctuations about the valence bond solid ground state can mediate an
attractive interaction that drives unconventional superconducting correlations.
We discuss the extensions of our findings to higher dimensions and argue that,
depending on the filling of conduction electrons, the magnon Bose-Einstein

determine, owing to the paucity of its stars in the solar neighbourhood. With
tentative evidence from $\it{Gaia}$ that the nearby stellar halo is dominated
by a massive accretion event -- referred to as $\it{Gaia-Enceladus}$ or Sausage
-- these constraints are now increasingly urgent. We measure the mass in
kinematically selected mono-abundance populations (MAPs) of the stellar halo
between $-3 <$ [Fe/H] $< -1$ and $0.0 <$ [Mg/Fe] $< 0.4$ using red giant star
counts from APOGEE DR14. We find that MAPs are well fit by single power laws on
triaxial ellipsoidal surfaces, and we show that that the power law slope
$\alpha$ changes such that high $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]}$ populations have $\alpha
\sim 4$, whereas low [Mg/Fe] MAPs are more extended with shallow slopes,
$\alpha \sim 2$. We estimate the total stellar mass to be $M_{*,\mathrm{tot}} =
1.3^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\times10^{9}\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, of which we estimate $\sim
0.9^{+0.2}_{-0.1} \times 10^{9} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ to be accreted. We estimate
that the mass of accreted stars with $e > 0.7$ is
$M_{*,\mathrm{accreted},e>0.7} = 3 \pm 1\ \mathrm{(stat.)}\pm 1\
\mathrm{(syst.)}\times10^{8}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$, or $\sim 30-50\%$ of the
accreted halo mass. If the majority of these stars $\it{are}$ the progeny of a
massive accreted dwarf, this places an upper limit on its stellar mass, and
implies a halo mass for the progenitor of $\sim 10^{10.2\pm0.2}\
\mathrm{M_\odot}$. This constraint not only shows that the
$\it{Gaia-Enceladus}$/Sausage progenitor may not be as massive as originally
suggested, but that the majority of the Milky Way stellar halo was accreted.
These measurements are an important step towards fully reconstructing the
assembly history of the Milky Way.

redshifted with respect to the systemic redshifts of galaxies, likely due to
resonant scattering of Ly$\alpha$ photons. Here we measure the average velocity
offset for a sample of 96 $z\approx3.3$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) with a
median Ly$\alpha$ flux (luminosity) of $\approx 10^{-17}~\rm
erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$ ($\approx10^{42}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$) and a median star
formation rate (SFR) of $\approx1.3 \rm M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$ (not corrected for
possible dust extinction), detected by the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer as
part of our MUSEQuBES circumgalactic medium (CGM) survey. By postulating that
the stacked CGM absorption profiles of these LAEs, probed by 8 background
quasars, must be centered on the systemic redshift, we measure an average
velocity offset, V$_{\rm offset} = 171 \pm 8$ $\rm km s^{-1}$, between the
Ly$\alpha$ emission peak and the systemic redshift. The observed V$_{\rm
offset}$ is lower by factors of $\approx1.4$ and $\approx2.6$ compared to the
velocity offsets measured for narrow-band selected LAEs and Lyman break
galaxies, respectively, which probe galaxies with higher masses and SFRs.
Consistent with earlier studies based on direct measurements for individual
objects, we find that the V$_{\rm offset}$ is correlated with the full width at
half-maximum of the red peak of the Ly$\alpha$ line, and anti-correlated with
the rest-frame equivalent width. Moreover, we find that $V_{\rm offset}$ is
correlated with SFR with a sub-linear scaling relation, V$_{\rm offset}\propto
\rm SFR^{0.16\pm0.03}$. Adopting the mass scaling for main sequence galaxies,
such a relation suggests that V$_{\rm offset}$ scales with the circular
velocity of the dark matter halos hosting the LAEs.

optical/near-infrared(NIR)/radio counterparts to the 897 S2COSMOS submillimeter
sources with S$_{850}$>1.6mJy, yielding an overall identification rate of
($78\pm9$)%. We find that ($22\pm5$)% of S2COSMOS sources have multiple
identified counterparts. We estimate that roughly 27% of these multiple
counterparts within the same SCUBA-2 error circles very likely arise from
physically associated galaxies rather than line-of-sight projections by chance.
The photometric redshift of our radio$+$machine-learning identified SMGs ranges
from z=0.2 to 5.7 and peaks at $z=2.3\pm0.1$. The AGN fraction of our sample is
($19\pm4$)%, which is consistent with that of ALMA SMGs in the literature.
Comparing with radio/NIR-detected field galaxy population in the COSMOS field,
our radio+machine-learning identified counterparts of SMGs have the highest
star-formation rates and stellar masses. These characteristics suggest that our
identified counterparts of S2COSMOS sources are a representative sample of SMGs
at z<3. We employ our machine-learning technique to the whole COSMOS field and
identified 6,877 potential SMGs, most of which are expected to have
submillimeter emission fainter than the confusion limit of our S2COSMOS surveys

statistically large sample, finding that they reside in high-mass dark matter
halos ($(1.2\pm0.3)\times10^{13}\,h^{-1}\,\rm M_{\odot}$), which suggests that
SMGs may be the progenitors of massive ellipticals we see in the local

theory by uniting the non-perturbative methods of the conformal bootstrap and
supersymmetric localization, and utilizing special features of 3d ${\cal N} =
4$ theories such as mirror symmetry and a protected sector described by
topological quantum mechanics (TQM). Supersymmetric localization allows for the
exact determination of the conformal and flavor central charges, and the latter
can be fed into the mini-bootstrap of the TQM to solve for a subset of the OPE
data. We examine the implications of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ mirror action for the
SCFT single- and mixed-branch crossing equations for the moment map operators,
and apply numerical bootstrap to obtain universal constraints on OPE data for
given flavor symmetry groups. A key ingredient in applying the bootstrap
analysis is the determination of the mixed-branch superconformal blocks. Among
other results, we show that the simplest known self-mirror theory with $SU(2)
\times SU(2)$ flavor symmetry saturates our bootstrap bounds, which allows us
to extract the non-BPS data and examine the self-mirror $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry

conformal matter SCFTs on a generic Riemann surface. We derive the theories
corresponding to three punctured spheres (trinions) with three maximal
punctures, from which one can construct models corresponding to generic
surfaces. The trinion models are simple quiver theories with $\mathcal{N}=1$
$SU(2)$ gauge nodes. One of the three puncture non abelian symmetries is
emergent in the IR. The derivation of the trinions proceeds by analyzing RG
flows between conformal matter SCFTs with different values of $N$ and relations
between their subsequent reductions to $4d$. In particular, using the flows we
first derive trinions with two maximal and one minimal punctures, and then we
argue that collections of $N$ minimal punctures can be interpreted as a maximal
one. This suggestion is checked by matching the properties of the $4d$ models
such as `t Hooft anomalies, symmetries, and the structure of the conformal
manifold to the expectations from $6d$. We then use the understanding that
collections of minimal punctures might be equivalent to maximal ones to
construct trinions with three maximal punctures, and then $4d$ theories
corresponding to arbitrary surfaces, for $6d$ models described by two $M5$
branes probing a $\mathbb{Z}_k$ singularity. This entails the introduction of a
novel type of maximal puncture. Again, the suggestion is checked by matching
anomalies, symmetries and the conformal manifold to expectations from six
dimensions. These constructions thus give us a detailed understanding of
compactifications of two sequences of six dimensional SCFTs to four dimensions.

relationship between galaxies and dark matter halos. These new techniques are
sensitive to the scatter at low halo masses, making them complementary to
previous constraints that are dependent on clustering amplitudes or rich galaxy
groups, both of which are only sensitive to more massive halos. In both of our
methods, we use a galaxy group finder to locate central galaxies in the SDSS
main galaxy sample. Our first technique uses the small-scale cross-correlation
of central galaxies with all lower mass galaxies. This quantity is sensitive to
the satellite fraction of low-mass galaxies, which is in turn driven by the
scatter between halos and galaxies. The second technique uses the kurtosis of
the distribution of line-of-sight velocities between central galaxies and
neighboring galaxies. This quantity is sensitive to the distribution of halo
masses that contain the central galaxies at fixed stellar mass. Theoretical
models are constructed using peak halo circular velocity, $V_{\rm peak}$, as
our property to connect galaxies to halos. The cross-correlation technique
yields a constraint of $\sigma[ M_\ast|V_{\rm peak}]=0.27\pm 0.05$ dex,
corresponding to a scatter in $\log M_\ast$ at fixed $M_h$ of $\sigma[
M_\ast|M_h]=0.38\pm 0.06$ dex at $M_h=10^{11.8}$ Msun. The kurtosis technique
yields $\sigma[ M_\ast|V_{\rm peak}]=0.30\pm0.03$, corresponding to $\sigma[
M_\ast|M_h]=0.34\pm 0.04$ at $M_h=10^{12.2}$ Msun. The values of $\sigma[
M_\ast|M_h]$ are significantly larger than the constraints at higher masses, in
agreement with the results of hydrodynamic simulations. This increase is only
partly due to the scatter between $V_{\rm peak}$ and $M_h$, and it represents
an increase of nearly a factor of two relative to the values inferred from
clustering and group studies at high masses.

physics on the evolution of ellipticals by performing three-dimensional
non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the interactions of active
galactic nucleus (AGN) jets with the CGM including magnetic fields, and cosmic
rays (CRs) and their transport processes. We find that the physics of feedback
operating on large galactic scales depends very sensitively on plasma physics
operating on small scales. Specifically, we demonstrate that: (i) in the purely
hydrodynamical case, the AGN jets initially maintain the atmospheres in global
thermal balance. However, local thermal instability generically leads to the
formation of massive cold disks in the vicinity of the central black hole in
disagreement with observations; (ii) including weak magnetic fields prevents
the formation of the disks because local B-field amplification in the
precipitating cold gas leads to strong magnetic breaking, which quickly
extracts angular momentum from the accreting clouds. The magnetic fields
transform the cold clouds into narrow filaments that do not fall ballistically;
(iii) when plasma composition in the AGN jets is dominated by CRs, and CR
transport is neglected, the atmospheres exhibit cooling catastrophes due to
inefficient heat transfer from the AGN to CGM despite Coulomb/hadronic CR
losses being present; (iv) including CR streaming and heating restores
agreement with the observations, i.e., cooling catastrophes are prevented and
massive cold central disks do not form. The AGN power is reduced as its energy
is utilized efficiently.

variability and the correlation between flux changes at different wavelengths.
Unprecedented $\gamma$-ray flaring activity was observed during 2016
November-2017 February, with four major outbursts. A peak flux of (2158 $\pm$
63)$\times$10$^{-8}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a luminosity of
(2.2 $\pm$ 0.1)$\times$10$^{50}$ erg s$^{-1}$, was reached on 2016 December 28.
These four $\gamma$-ray outbursts have corresponding events in the
near-infrared, optical, and UV bands, with the peaks observed at the same time.
A general agreement between X-ray and $\gamma$-ray activity is found. The
$\gamma$-ray flux variations show a general, strong correlation with the
optical ones with no time lag between the two bands and a comparable
variability amplitude. This $\gamma$-ray/optical relationship is in agreement
with the geometrical model that has successfully explained the low-energy flux
and spectral behaviour, suggesting that the long-term flux variations are
mainly due to changes in the Doppler factor produced by variations of the
viewing angle of the emitting regions. The difference in behaviour between
radio and higher energy emission would be ascribed to different viewing angles
of the jet regions producing their emission.

infrastructure can support several third-party (""vertical"") services, each

more VNFs are often common to multiple services, thus the services deployment
cost could be reduced by letting the services share the same VNF instance
instead of devoting a separate instance to each service. By doing that,
however, it is critical that the target KPI (key performance indicators) of all
services are met. To this end, we study the VNF sharing problem and make
decisions on (i) when sharing VNFs among multiple services is possible, (ii)
how to adapt the virtual machines running the shared VNFs to the combined load
of the assigned services, and (iii) how to prioritize the services traffic
within shared VNFs. All decisions aim to minimize the cost for the mobile

total delay. Notably, we show that the aforementioned priorities should be
managed dynamically and vary across VNFs. We then propose the FlexShare
algorithm to provide near-optimal VNF-sharing and priority assignment decisions
in polynomial time. We prove that FlexShare is within a constant factor from
the optimum and, using real-world VNF graphs, we show that it consistently

non-singular bounce. This is a generalization of results obtained previously in
limiting curvature mimetic gravity and loop quantum cosmology. A geometric
interpretation is provided for the transition rule as a linear map in the
Kasner plane. We show that the general evolution of anisotropies in a Bianchi I
universe -- including during the bounce phase -- is equivalent to the motion of
a point particle on a sphere, where the sphere is the one-point
compactification of the Kasner plane. In addition, we study the evolution of
anisotropies in a large family of bouncing Bianchi I space-times. We also
present a novel explicit solution to the Einstein equations for a Bianchi I
universe with ekpyrotic matter with a constant equation of state $\omega=3$.

investigate these concepts, by tracking the evolution of satellites and their
hosts after entering the cluster and find that tidal forces during their first
pericentric passage are very efficient at breaking up groups, preferentially
removing satellites at larger distances from their hosts. 92.2% of satellites
whose host has passed pericentre will leave their host by $z=0$, typically no
later than half a Gyr after pericentric passage. We find satellites leave with
high velocities, and quickly separate to large distances from their hosts,
making their identification within the cluster population challenging. Those
few satellites ($\sim$7.8%) that remain bound to their hosts after a
pericentric passage are typically found close to their host centres. This
implies that substructure seen in clusters today is very likely on first infall
into the cluster, and yet to pass pericentre. This is even more likely if the
substructure is extended, with satellites beyond R$_{200}$ of their host. We
find the cluster dominates the tidal mass loss and destruction of satellites,
and is responsible for rapidly halting the accretion of new satellites onto
hosts once they reach 0.6-0.8 R$_{200}$ radii from the cluster.

costing the same amount. However, in reality, a scientist often has
considerable discretion regarding which variables to measure, and the decision
involves a tradeoff between model accuracy and cost (where cost can refer to
money, time, difficulty, or intrusiveness). In particular, unnecessarily
including an expensive feature in a model is worse than unnecessarily including
a cheap feature. We propose a procedure, which we call cheap knockoffs, for
performing feature selection in a cost-conscious manner. The key idea behind
our method is to force higher cost features to compete with more knockoffs than
cheaper features. We derive an upper bound on the weighted false discovery
proportion associated with this procedure, which corresponds to the fraction of
the feature cost that is wasted on unimportant features. We prove that this
bound holds simultaneously with high probability over a path of selected
variable sets of increasing size. A user may thus select a set of features
based, for example, on the overall budget, while knowing that no more than a
particular fraction of feature cost is wasted. We investigate, through
simulation and a biomedical application, the practical importance of
incorporating cost considerations into the feature selection process.

use the bibliographic coupling network, derived from all physics papers that
were published in the Physical Review journals in the past century, to try to
identify them as mainstream, out-of-the-box, or interdisciplinary. We show that
the network clusters into scientific fields. The position of individual papers
with respect to these clusters allows us to estimate their degree of
mainstreamness or interdisciplinary. We show that over the past decades the

Studying the rewards of papers, we find that in terms of absolute citations,

mainstream papers perform less than interdisciplinary ones in terms of citation

results to a Gaussian-fitting method. Since the deep learning approach allows
the generation of more training images, it should perform well in the
source-finding task. We test the source-finding methods on artificial data
created for the data challenge of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). We
investigate sources that are divided into three classes: star forming galaxies
(SFGs) and two classes of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The~artificial data are
given at two different frequencies (560~MHz and 1400~MHz), three total
integration times (8 h, 100 h, 1000 h), and three signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)

Gaussian-fitting approach in the recovery of SFGs and all sources, although at
the lowest SNR of one, the better performance is likely due to chance matches.
The~Gaussian-fitting method performs better in the recovery of the AGN-type
sources at lower SNRs. At~a higher SNR, ConvoSource performs better on average
in the recovery of AGN sources, whereas the Gaussian-fitting method performs
better in the recovery of SFGs and all sources. ConvoSource usually performs
better at shorter total integration times and detects more true positives and
misses fewer sources compared to the Gaussian-fitting method; however, it
detects more false positives.

approximate the posterior using normalizing flows, a flexible parametric family

with a large bandwidth value epsilon, which makes the target similar to the
prior. The training data is ""distilled"" by using it to train an updated
normalizing flow. The process is iterated, using the updated flow as the
importance sampling proposal, and slowly reducing epsilon so the target becomes

achieve more accurate results. We illustrate our method in two challenging

the available multi-vehicle interaction scenarios are temporally segmented into
several interpretable fundamental building blocks, called traffic primitives,

primitives are transformed into the desired road to generate collision-free

NP-complete for undirected path graphs. Finally, we have characterized the
trees with equal ve-domination and independent ve-domination number.

which has no assumptions about the data and is a completely data-driven
approach. We test the ANN method by reconstructing functions of the Hubble
parameter measurements $H(z)$ and the distance-redshift relation $D_L(z)$ of
Type Ia supernovae. We find that both $H(z)$ and $D_L(z)$ can be reconstructed
with high accuracy. Furthermore, we estimate cosmological parameters using the
reconstructed functions of $H(z)$ and $D_L(z)$ and find the results are
consistent with those obtained using the observational data directly.
Therefore, we propose that the function reconstructed by ANN can represent the
actual distribution of observational data and can be used for parameter
estimation in further cosmological research. In addition, we present a new
strategy for training and evaluating the neural network, and a code for
reconstructing functions using ANN has been developed and is available for

technical difficulties of designing an experiment and translating its outcomes
into concrete claims about fundamental features of quantum fields. In practice,
all measurements of quantum fields are carried out through local probes.
Despite measuring only a small portion of the field, such local measurements
have the capacity to reveal many of the field's global features. This is
because, when in equilibrium with their environments, quantum fields store
global information locally, albeit in a scrambled way. We show that neural
networks can be trained to unscramble this information from data generated from
a very simple one-size-fits-all local measurement protocol. To illustrate this
general claim we will consider three non-trivial features of the field as case
studies: a) how a particle detector can learn about the field's boundary
conditions even before signals have time to propagate from the boundary to the
detector, b) how detectors can determine the temperature of the quantum field
even without thermalizing with it, and c) how detectors can distinguish between
Fock states and coherent states even when the first and second moments of all
their quadrature operators match. Each of these examples uses the exact same
simple fixed local measurement protocol and machine-learning ansatz
successfully. This supports the claim that the framework proposed here can be
applied to nearly any kind of local measurement on a quantum field to reveal
nearly any of the field's global properties in a one-size-fits-all manner.

Understanding human

information in a highly nonlinear manner, thus, it is challenging to explicitly
quantify the relationship between emotions and behaviors. In this work, we
employ deep transfer learning to analyze their inferential capacity and
contextual importance. We first train a network to quantify emotions from
acoustic signals and then use information from the emotion recognition network
as features for behavior recognition. We treat this emotion-related information
as behavioral primitives and further train higher level layers towards behavior
quantification. Through our analysis, we find that emotion-related information
is an important cue for behavior recognition. Further, we investigate the
importance of emotional-context in the expression of behavior by constraining
(or not) the neural networks' contextual view of the data. This demonstrates
that the sequence of emotions is critical in behavior expression. To achieve
these frameworks we employ hybrid architectures of convolutional networks and

revisited in 2D and 3D using fully compressible high-resolution simulations. We
conduct a systematic analysis of the effects of perturbation Reynolds number
($Re_p$) and Atwood number ($A$) on RTI's late-time growth. Contrary to the
common belief that single-mode RTI reaches a terminal bubble velocity, we show
that the bubble re-accelerates when $Re_p$ is sufficiently large, consistent
with [Ramaparabhu et al. 2006, Wei and Livescu 2012]. However, unlike in
[Ramaparabhu et al. 2006], we find that for a sufficiently high $Re_p$, the
bubble's late-time acceleration is persistent and does not vanish. Analysis of
vorticity dynamics shows a clear correlation between vortices inside the bubble
and re-acceleration. Due to symmetry around the bubble and spike (vertical)
axes, the self-propagation velocity of vortices points in the vertical
direction. If viscosity is sufficiently small, the vortices persist long enough
to enter the bubble tip and accelerate the bubble [Wei and Livescu 2012]. A
similar effect has also been observed in ablative RTI [Betti and Sanz 2006]. As
the spike growth increases relative to that of the bubble at higher $A$,
vorticity production shifts downward, away from the centerline and toward the
spike tip. We modify the Betti-Sanz model for bubble velocity by introducing a
vorticity efficiency factor $\eta=0.45$ to accurately account for
re-acceleration caused by vorticity in the bubble tip. It had been previously
suggested that vorticity generation and the associated bubble re-acceleration
are suppressed at high $A$. However, we present evidence that if the large
$Re_p$ limit is taken first, bubble re-acceleration is still possible. Our

blindness in working age populations. Color fundus photography (CFP) is the
most cost-effective imaging modality to screen for retinal disorders. However,
its application to glaucoma has been limited to the computation of a few
related biomarkers such as the vertical cup-to-disc ratio. Deep learning
approaches, although widely applied for medical image analysis, have not been
extensively used for glaucoma assessment due to the limited size of the
available data sets. Furthermore, the lack of a standardize benchmark strategy
makes difficult to compare existing methods in a uniform way. In order to
overcome these issues we set up the Retinal Fundus Glaucoma Challenge, REFUGE
(\url{https://refuge.grand-challenge.org}), held in conjunction with MICCAI
2018. The challenge consisted of two primary tasks, namely optic disc/cup
segmentation and glaucoma classification. As part of REFUGE, we have publicly
released a data set of 1200 fundus images with ground truth segmentations and
clinical glaucoma labels, currently the largest existing one. We have also
built an evaluation framework to ease and ensure fairness in the comparison of
different models, encouraging the development of novel techniques in the field.
12 teams qualified and participated in the online challenge. This paper
summarizes their methods and analyzes their corresponding results. In
particular, we observed that two of the top-ranked teams outperformed two human
experts in the glaucoma classification task. Furthermore, the segmentation
results were in general consistent with the ground truth annotations, with
complementary outcomes that can be further exploited by ensembling the results.

arbitrary electronic structure methods that provide an accurate charge density

approximation for weak electrostatic potentials, finite size of the mobile
electrolyte ions and a Stern-layer correction. Recasting the Poisson-Boltzmann
equations into Euler-Lagrange equations then significantly simplifies the
derivation of the free energy of solvation for these approximate models. The
parameters of the model are then either fit directly to experimental
observables, e.g. the finite ion size, or optimized for agreement with
experimental results. Experimental data for this optimization is available in
the form of Sechenov coefficients that describe the linear dependence of the
salting-out effect of solutes with respect to the electrolyte concentration. In
the final part we rationalize the qualitative disagreement of the finite ion
size modification to the Poisson-Boltzmann model with experimental observations
by taking into account the electrolyte concentration dependence of the Stern

observations while including the finite ion size effects is then outlined. This

information--that is, quantum states--from unwanted environmental interactions
(decoherence) and other forms of noise. The information is stored in a quantum
error-correcting code, which is a subspace in a larger Hilbert space. This code
is designed so that the most common errors move the state into an error space
orthogonal to the original code space while preserving the information in the
state. It is possible to determine whether an error has occurred by a suitable
measurement and to apply a unitary correction that returns the state to the
code space, without measuring (and hence disturbing) the protected state
itself. In general, codewords of a quantum code are entangled states. No code
that stores information can protect against all possible errors; instead, codes
are designed to correct a specific error set, which should be chosen to match
the most likely types of noise. An error set is represented by a set of
operators that can multiply the codeword state. Quantum error correction is
used to protect information in quantum communication (where quantum states pass
through noisy channels) and quantum computation (where quantum states are
transformed through a sequence of imperfect computational steps in the presence
of environmental decoherence to solve a computational problem). In quantum
computation, error correction is just one component of fault-tolerant design.

promising path to error-corrected quantum computation. One advantageous way to
achieve this is through Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) grid states, whose
symmetries allow for the correction of any small continuous error on the
oscillator. Unfortunately, ideal grid states have infinite energy, so it is
important to find finite-energy approximations that are realistic, practical,
and useful for applications. In the first half of this work we investigate the
impact of imperfect GKP states on computational circuits independently of the
physical architecture. To this end, we analyze the behaviour of the physical
and logical content of normalizable GKP states through several figures of
merit, employing a recently-developed modular subsystem decomposition. By
tracking the errors that enter into the computational circuit due to
imperfections in the GKP states, we are able to gauge the utility of these
states for NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices. In the second half,
we focus on a state preparation approach in the photonic domain wherein
photon-number-resolving measurements on some modes of Gaussian states produce
non-Gaussian states in others. We produce detailed numerical results for the
preparation of GKP states alongside estimating the resource requirements in
practical settings and probing the quality of the resulting states with the
tools we develop. Our numerical experiments indicate that we can generate any
state in the GKP Bloch sphere with nearly equal resources, which has
implications for magic state preparation overheads.

introduce Stone pseudovarieties, that is, classes of Stone topological algebras
of a fixed topological signature that are closed under taking Stone quotients,
closed subalgebras and finite direct products. Looking at Stone spaces as the
dual spaces of Boolean algebras, we find a simple characterization of when the
dual space admits a natural structure of topological algebra. This provides a
new approach to duality theory which culminates in the proof that a Stone
quotient of a Stone topological algebra that is residually in a given Stone
pseudovariety is also residually in it, thereby extending the corresponding
result of M. Gehrke for the Stone pseudovariety of all finite algebras over

Stone pseudovariety, and these are precisely the Stone analogues of varieties.
A Birkhoff type theorem for Stone varieties is also established.

of memory requests. Instead, we show that performance is proportional to the
number of memory channels available to handle small data transfers with limited
spatial locality.
  Using several widely used graph frameworks, including Gunrock (on the GPU)
and GAPBS \& Ligra (for CPUs), we evaluate key graph analytics kernels using
two unique memory hierarchies, DDR-based and HBM/MCDRAM. Our results show that
the differences in the peak bandwidths of several Pascal-generation GPU memory

Furthermore, our experiments on CPU and Xeon Phi systems demonstrate that the
number of memory channels utilized can be a decisive factor in performance
across several different applications. For CPU systems with smaller thread
counts, the memory channels can be underutilized while systems with high thread
counts can oversaturate the memory subsystem, which leads to limited
performance. Finally, we model the potential performance improvements of adding

the nodal demands are met and that the synchronized units generating below
their limits follow a linear model for primary response. The resulting
formulation is a mixed-integer linear program since the primary response model
introduces disjunctions to the SCOPF problem. Unfortunately, exact methods
relying on traditional Benders' decomposition do not scale well. As an
alternative, we propose a decomposition scheme based on the
column-and-constraint-generation algorithm where we iteratively add
disjunctions and cuts. We provide procedures for preprocessing dedicated cuts
and for numerically determining the post-contingency responses based on the
master problem solutions. We also discuss heuristics to generate high-quality
primal solutions and upper bounds for the method. Finally, we demonstrate the
efficiency of the proposed method on large-scale systems.

of vital importance to study the dynamic stability of microgrids (MGs) with
external control inputs in the electromagnetic transient (EMT) time scale. This
requires detailed models of the underlying control structure of MGs and results
in a high-order nonlinear MG control system. Higher-level controller design and
stability analysis of such high-order systems are usually intractable and
computation-costly. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a
large-signal order reduction (LSOR) method for MGs with considerations of
external control inputs and the detailed dynamics of underlying control levels
based on singular perturbation theory (SPT). Specially, we innovatively
proposed and strictly proved a general stability and accuracy assessment
theorem that allows us to analyze the dynamic stability of a full-order
nonlinear system by only leveraging its corresponding reduced-order model (ROM)
and boundary layer model (BLM). Moreover, this theorem also theoretically
provides a set of conditions under which the developed ROM is accurate.
Finally, by embedding such a theorem into the SPT, we propose a novel LSOR
approach with guaranteed accuracy and stability analysis equivalence. The
proposed LSOR method is generic and can be applied to arbitrary dynamic
systems. Multiple case studies are conducted on MG systems to show the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

and active gravitational masses and energy in semiclassical variant of general
relativity, where gravitational field is not quantized but matter is quantized.
To this end, we consider the simplest quantum body with internal degrees of
freedom - a hydrogen atom. We concentrate our attention on the following
physical effects, related to electron mass. The first one is inequivalence
between passive gravitational mass and energy at microscopic level. Indeed,
quantum measurement of gravitational mass can give result, which is different
from the expected, $m \neq m_e + \frac{E_1}{c^2}$, where electron is initially
in its ground state; $m_e$ is the bare electron mass. The second effect is that
the expectation values of both passive and active gravitational masses of
stationary quantum states are equivalent to the expectation value of energy.
The most spectacular effects are inequivalence of passive and active
gravitational masses and energy at macroscopic level for ensemble of coherent
superpositions of stationary quantum states. We show that, for such
superpositions, the expectation values of passive and active gravitational
masses are not related to the expectation value of energy by the famous
Einstein's equation, $m \neq \frac{E}{c^2}$. In this review, we also improve
several drawbacks of the original pioneering works.

time-consuming, particularly for cases with large or irregularly shaped
targets. Inverse planning eases GK planning by solving an optimization problem.
However, due to the vast search space, most inverse planning algorithms have to
decouple the planning process to isocenter preselection and sector duration
optimization. This sequential scheme does not necessarily lead to optimal
isocenter locations and hence optimal plans. In this study, we attempt to
optimize the isocenter positions, beam shapes and durations simultaneously by
proposing a multi-resolution-level (MRL) strategy to handle the large-scale GK
optimization problem. In our approach, several rounds of optimizations were
performed with a progressively increased spatial resolution for isocenter
candidate selection. The isocenters selected from last round and their
neighbors on a finer resolution were used as new isocenter candidates for next
round of optimization. After plan optimization, shot sequencing was performed
to group the optimized sectors to deliverable shots supported by GK treatment
units. We have tested our algorithm on 6 GK cases previously treated in our
institution (2 meningioma cases, 3 cases with single metastasis and 1 case with
6 metastases). Compared with manual planning, achieving same coverage and
similar selectivity, our algorithm improved the gradient index averagely from
3.1 to 2.9 and reduced the maximum dose of brainstem from 8.0Gy to 5.6Gy. The
average beam-on time was also reduced by from 103.8 mins to 87.4 mins. Our
method was also compared with the inverse planning algorithm provided in

transition from thermionic emission to tunneling current and is present even in
thick devices (> 100 nm) due to charge trapping which controls the tunneling
distance. The turn-on voltage is linearly proportional to the Schottky barrier
height and, in contrast to traditional metal-insulator-metal diodes, is
logarithmically proportional to the device thickness. Hysteresis in the I-V

bimodal: it is executed by machines, but also read by humans. This bimodality,
we argue, leads developers to write code in certain preferred ways that would
be familiar to code readers. To test this theory, we 1) model familiarity using
a language model estimated over a large training corpus and 2) run an
experiment applying several meaning preserving transformations to Java and
Python expressions in a distinct test corpus to see if forms more familiar to

applications in acoustics, optics, and electronics. Commercial applications for
lithium niobate require high crystalline quality currently limited to bulk and
ion sliced material. Thin film lithium niobate is an attractive option for a
variety of integrated devices, but the research effort has been stagnant due to
poor material quality. Both lattice matched and mismatched lithium niobate are
grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and studied to understand the role of
substrate and temperature on nucleation conditions and material quality. Growth
on sapphire produces partially coalesced columnar grains with atomically flat
plateaus and no twin planes. A symmetric rocking curve shows a narrow linewidth
with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 8.6 arcsec (0.0024{\deg}) which is
comparable to the 5.8 arcsec rocking curve FWHM of the substrate, while the
film asymmetric rocking curve is 510 arcsec FWHM. These values indicate that
the individual grains are relatively free of long-range disorder detectable by
x-ray diffraction (XRD) with minimal measurable tilt and twist and represents
the highest structural quality epitaxial material grown on lattice mismatched
sapphire without twin planes. Lithium niobate is also grown on lithium
tantalate producing high quality coalesced material without twin planes and
with a symmetric rocking curve of 193 arcsec, which is nearly equal to the
substrate rocking curve of 194 arcsec. The surface morphology of lithium
niobate on lithium tantalate is shown to be atomically flat by atomic force
microscopy (AFM).

framework of chiral quark models, where in the chiral limit factorization
between the longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom occurs. This feature
leads, at the quark-model scale, to a particularly simple distribution of the
form $D(x_1,x_2, \vec{q}) = \delta(1-x_1-x_2) F(\vec{q})$, where $x_{1,2}$ are
the longitudinal momentum fractions carried the valence quark and antiquark and
$\vec{q}$ is their relative transverse momentum. For $\vec{q}=\vec{0}$ this
result complies immediately to the Gaunt-Sterling sum rules. The DGLAP
evolution to higher scales is carried out in terms of the Mellin moments. We
then explore its role on the longitudinal correlation quantified with the ratio
of the double distribution to the product of single distributions, $D(x_1,x_2,
\vec{q}=\vec{0})/D(x_1)D(x_2)$. We point out that the ratios of moments
$\langle x_1^n x_2^m \rangle / \langle x_1^n \rangle \langle x_2^m \rangle $
are independent of the evolution, providing particularly suitable measures to
be tested in the upcoming lattice simulations. The transverse form factor
$F(\vec{q})$ and its Fourier conjugate in the relative transverse coordinate
$\vec{b}$ are obtained in variants of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with the
spectral and Pauli-Villars regularizations.The results are valid in the
soft-momentum domain. Interestingly, with the spectral regularization of the
model, the effective cross section for the double parton scattering of pions is
exactly equal to the geometric cross section, $\sigma_{\rm eff}=\pi \langle
\vec{b}^2 \rangle$ and yields about 20~mb.

to compute standardized residuals using expected values and standard deviations
of the observed data, then use these values to detect outliers and assess model
fit. Approximate normality of these residuals is key for this process to have
good properties, but in many modeling contexts, especially for complex,
multi-level models, normality may not hold. In these cases outlier detection
and model diagnostics aren't properly calibrated. Alternatively, as we
demonstrate, residuals computed from the percentile location of a datum's value
in its full predictive distribution lead to well calibrated evaluations of
model fit. We generalize an approach described by Dunn and Smyth (1996) and
evaluate properties mathematically, via case-studies and by simulation. In
addition, we show that the standard residuals can be calibrated to mimic the
percentile approach, but that this extra step is avoided by directly using
percentile-based residuals. For both the percentile-based residuals and the
calibrated standard residuals, the use of full predictive distributions with

diversity of X-ray line profiles, we explore several possible geometrical
models. Based on the highest signal-to-noise 2009 epoch, we find that a polar
geometry with two distinct opening angle configurations and internal
obscuration can successfully reproduce all of the observed line profiles. The
best fit model consists of two plasma components: (1) a mildly absorbed
(2$\times$10$^{21}$\,cm$^{-2}$), cooler ($\approx$2\,keV) with high Ne, Mg, Si,
and S abundances associated with a wide polar interaction region (half-opening
angle $\approx$58$^{\circ}$); (2) a moderately absorbed
(2$\times$10$^{22}$\,cm$^{-2}$), hotter (>~20\,keV) plasma with high Fe
abundances and strong internal obscuration associated with a narrow polar
interaction region (half-opening angle $\approx$20$^{\circ}$). We extend this
model to seven further epochs with lower signal-to-noise ratio and/or lower
spectral-resolution between 2000-2018, yielding several interesting trends in
absorption, flux, geometry and expansion velocity. We argue that the hotter and
colder components are associated with reflected and forward shocks,

greater number of political parties with at least one elected representative. I

non-traditional parties are the main beneficiaries of this greater political
openness. Second, regression discontinuity estimates show that political
openness substantially decreases conflict-related violence, namely the killing

local election results, I show that the lower level of political violence stems
from greater participation by parties with close links to armed groups. Using
data about the types of violence employed by these groups, and representation
at higher levels of government, I argue that armed violence has decreased not
because of power-sharing arrangements involving armed groups linked to the
parties with more political representation, but rather because armed groups
with less political power and visibility are deterred from initiating certain
types of violence.

have the following characteristics: 1) high feasibility--they can be used to
study the tail behavior of various matrix functions, e.g., arbitrary matrix
norms, the absolute value of the sum of the sum of the $j$ largest singular
values (resp. eigenvalues) of complex matrices (resp. Hermitian matrices); and
2) independence of matrix dimension --- they do not have the matrix-dimension
term as a product factor, and thus are suitable to the scenario of
high-dimensional or infinite-dimensional random matrices. The price we pay to
obtain these advantages is that the convergence rate of the resulting
inequalities will become slow when the number of summand random matrices is
large. We also develop the tail inequalities for matrix random series and
matrix martingale difference sequence. We also demonstrate usefulness of our
tail bounds in several fields. In compressed sensing, we employ the resulted
tail inequalities to achieve a proof of the restricted isometry property when
the measurement matrix is the sum of random matrices without any assumption on
the distributions of matrix entries. In probability theory, we derive a new
upper bound to the supreme of stochastic processes. In machine learning, we
prove new expectation bounds of sums of random matrices matrix and obtain
matrix approximation schemes via random sampling. In quantum information, we

hypergraphs. In theoretical computer science, we obtain randomness-efficient
samplers using matrix expander graphs that can be efficiently implemented in

HAWC measures a softening of the light component (p+He) around $10^{13.5}\,$eV;
measurements of the Pierre Auger Observatory show that the second knee is a
smooth feature extending at least over the range of $100-200\,$PeV and that the
energy spectrum between the ankle and the cut-off cannot be described by a
simple broken power law. Measurements of the mass composition confirm that the
composition is a varying mixture of protons and nuclei at least up to several
$10\,$EeV. A joint effort of several collaborations helps to better assess
deficiencies of hadronic interaction models, e.g., by quantifying the muon
deficit in the models over the shower energy. Anisotropy measurements with
higher precision generally confirm earlier results. A change of the amplitude
and phase of the equatorial dipole indicates that in the energy range between
the second knee and the ankle there likely is a transition from Galactic to
extragalactic sources. However, neither the most energetic Galatic nor the
extragalactic sources have been discovered, which remains a primary science
goal. Next to more exposure, an increase of measurement accuracy and decrease
of systematic uncertainties will provide future progress. It is particularly
exciting that new experiments are built and existing experiments upgraded to
increase the measurement accuracy of the energy and mass composition, e.g., by
combining radio antennas with particle detectors. Last but not least, there is
a trend that experiments are designed such that they can target cosmic rays,
photons, and neutrinos at the same time, which will facilitate multi-messenger

Parareal, provide an attractive option for increasing concurrency when
simulating time-dependent PDEs in modern high-performance computing
environments. While these techniques have been very successful for parabolic
equations, it has often been observed that their performance suffers
dramatically when applied to advection-dominated problems or purely hyperbolic
PDEs using standard rediscretization approaches on coarse grids. In this paper,
we apply MGRIT or Parareal to the constant-coefficient linear advection
equation, appealing to existing convergence theory to provide insight into the
typically non-scalable or even divergent behavior of these solvers for this
problem. To overcome these failings, we replace rediscretization on coarse
grids with improved coarse-grid operators that are computed by applying
optimization techniques to approximately minimize error estimates from the
convergence theory. One of our main findings is that, in order to obtain fast
convergence as for parabolic problems, coarse-grid operators should take into
account the behavior of the hyperbolic problem by tracking the characteristic
curves. Our approach is tested for schemes of various orders using explicit or
implicit Runge-Kutta methods combined with upwind-finite-difference spatial
discretizations. In all cases, we obtain scalable convergence in just a handful
of iterations, with parallel tests also showing significant speed-ups over
sequential time-stepping. Our insight of tracking characteristics on coarse
grids provides a key idea for solving the long-standing problem of efficient
parallel-in-time integration for hyperbolic PDEs.

determine the optimal technique to use for converting raw digital count imagery
to reflectance maps. The first two methods utilized in-scene reflectance
conversion panels along with the empirical line method (ELM), while the final
method used an upward looking sensor that recorded the band-effective spectral
downwelling irradiance. The methods employed were 2-Point ELM, 1-point ELM, and
At-altitude Radiance Ratio (AARR). The average signed reflectance factor errors
produced by these methods on real sUAS imagery were: -0.005, -0.0028, and
-0.0244 respectively. These errors were produced across four altitudes (150,

Finally, data was simulated using the MODTRAN code to generate downwelling

a film of it is being played forward or in reverse: any transition will occur
with the same frequency in the forward as in the reverse direction. However, if
expenditure of energy changes the rate of even a single transition to yield a

widespread breakdown, far beyond the point at which the energy is expended. An
explosion of interdependency also arises, with steady-state probabilities of
system states depending in a complicated manner on the rate of every transition

complexity, we find that cyclic paths have reversibility properties that remain
local, and which can exhibit symmetry, no matter how far the system is from
thermodynamic equilibrium. Specifically, given any cycle of reversible
transitions, the ratio of the frequencies with which the cycle is traversed in
one direction versus the other is determined, in the long-time limit, only by
the thermodynamic force on the cycle itself, without requiring knowledge of
transition rates elsewhere in the system. In particular, if there is no net
energy expenditure on the cycle, then, over long times, the cycle traversal
frequencies are the same in either direction.

multidetector in z direction can increase the coverage of the detector provided
limited detector rows. It can speed up volumetric CT scan, lower the radiation
dose and reduce motion artifacts. However, it leads to insufficient data for
reconstruction. That means reconstructions from general analytical methods will
have severe artifacts. Iterative reconstruction methods might be able to deal
with this situation but with the cost of huge computational load. In this work,
we propose a cascaded dual-domain deep learning method that completes both data
transformation in projection domain and error reduction in image domain. First,
a convolutional neural network (CNN) in projection domain is constructed to
estimate missing helical projection data and converting helical projection data
to 2D fan-beam projection data. This step is to suppress helical artifacts and
reduce the following computational cost. Then, an analytical linear operator is
followed to transfer the data from projection domain to image domain. Finally,
an image domain CNN is added to improve image quality further. These three
steps work as an entirety and can be trained end to end. The overall network is
trained using a simulated lung CT dataset with Poisson noise from 25 patients.
We evaluate the trained network on another three patients and obtain very
encouraging results with both visual examination and quantitative comparison.
The resulting RRMSE is 6.56% and the SSIM is 99.60%. In addition, we test the
trained network on the lung CT dataset with different noise level and a new
dental CT dataset to demonstrate the generalization and robustness of our
method.

Systems (SHSs). Today, a myriad of SHS devices and applications are widely
available to users and have already started to re-define our modern lives.
Smart home users utilize the apps to control and automate such devices. Users
can develop their own apps or easily download and install them from
vendor-specific app markets. App-based SHSs offer many tangible benefits to our
lives, but also unfold diverse security risks. Several attacks have already
been reported for SHSs. However, current security solutions consider smart home
devices and apps individually to detect malicious actions rather than the
context of the SHS as a whole. The existing mechanisms cannot capture user
activities and sensor-device-user interactions in a holistic fashion. To
address these issues, in this paper, we introduce Aegis, a novel context-aware
security framework to detect malicious behavior in a SHS. Specifically, Aegis
observes the states of the connected smart home entities (sensors and devices)
for different user activities and usage patterns in a SHS and builds a
contextual model to differentiate between malicious and benign behavior. We
evaluated the efficacy and performance of Aegis in multiple smart home settings
(i.e., single bedroom, double bedroom, duplex) with real-life users performing
day-to-day activities and real SHS devices. We also measured the performance of
Aegis against five different malicious behaviors. Our detailed evaluation shows
that Aegis can detect malicious behavior in SHS with high accuracy (over 95%)
and secure the SHS regardless of the smart home layout, device configuration,
installed apps, and enforced user policies. Finally, Aegis achieves minimum
overhead in detecting malicious behavior in SHS, ensuring easy deployability in
real-life smart environments.

detection. We build the classifier based on the minimum description length
(MDL) principle. This involves selecting a model that best compresses the
training dataset for each class considering the MDL criterion. To select a
model for a dataset, we first use clustering followed by closed frequent
pattern mining to extract a subset of closed frequent patterns (CFPs). We show
that this method acts as a pattern summarization method to avoid pattern
explosion; this is done by giving priority to longer CFPs, and without
requiring to extract all CFPs. We then use the MDL criterion to further
summarize extracted patterns, and construct a code table of patterns. This code
table is considered as the selected model for the compression of the dataset.
We evaluate our classifier for the problem of static malware detection in
portable executable (PE) files. We consider API calls of PE files as their
distinguishing features. The presence-absence of API calls forms a
transactional dataset. Using our proposed method, we construct two code tables,
one for the benign training dataset, and one for the malware training dataset.
Our dataset consists of 19696 benign, and 19696 malware samples, each a binary

  Stochastic Simulation","54 pages, 1 figure",,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  When we use simulation to assess the performance of stochastic systems, the
input models used to drive simulation experiments are often estimated from
finite real-world data. There exist both input model and simulation estimation
uncertainties in the system performance estimates. Without strong prior
information on the input models and the system mean response surface, in this
paper, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric framework to quantify the impact
from both sources of uncertainty. Specifically, since the real-world data often
represent the variability caused by various latent sources of uncertainty,
Dirichlet Processes Mixtures (DPM) based nonparametric input models are
introduced to model a mixture of heterogeneous distributions, which can
faithfully capture the important features of real-world data, such as
multi-modality and skewness. Bayesian posteriors of flexible input models
characterize the input model estimation uncertainty, which automatically
accounts for both model selection and parameter value uncertainty. Then, input
model estimation uncertainty is propagated to outputs by using direct
simulation. Thus, under very general conditions, our framework delivers an
empirical credible interval accounting for both input and simulation
uncertainties. A variance decomposition is further developed to quantify the
relative contributions from both sources of uncertainty. Our approach is
supported by rigorous theoretical and empirical study.

paired residue fixed requires intermediate force for strand separation.

interacting collectives, we perform global convergence analysis for replicator
dynamics of a large, well-mixed population of individuals playing a repeated
snowdrift game with four typical strategies, which are always cooperate (ALLC),
tit-for-tat (TFT), suspicious tit-for-tat (STFT) and always defect (ALLD). The
dynamical model is a three-dimensional ODE system that is parameterized by the
payoffs of the base game. Instead of routine searches for evolutionarily stable
strategies and sets, we expand our analysis to determining the asymptotic
behavior of solution trajectories starting from any initial state, and in
particular show that for the full range of payoffs, every trajectory of the
system converges to an equilibrium point. The convergence results highlight
three findings that are of particular importance for understanding the
cooperation mechanisms among self-interested agents playing repeated snowdrift
games. First, the inclusion of TFT- and STFT-players, the two types of
conditional strategy players in the game, increases the share of cooperators of
the overall population compared to the situation when the population consists
of only ALLC- and ALLD-players. This confirms findings in biology and sociology
that reciprocity may promote cooperation in social collective actions, such as
reducing traffic jams and division of labor, where each individual may gain
more to play the opposite of what her opponent chooses. Second, surprisingly
enough, regardless of the payoffs, there always exists a set of initial
conditions under which ALLC players do not vanish in the long run, which does
not hold for all the other three types of players. So an ALLC-player, although
perceived as the one that can be easily taken advantage of in snowdrift games,
has certain endurance in the long run.

the halo as a Bose--Einstein condensate in terms of a massive scalar field that

explain how thermal undulations of CNTs can enhance their electrostatic

calculating the critical concentration, where the mean amplitude of undulation

non-identical distributions has remained unsolved.
  In this paper we provide an algorithm for the case of non-identical
distributions that selects the maximum element with probability $1/e$, and we
show that this is tight. We further show that if the observations arrive in a
random order, this barrier of $1/e$ can be broken using a static threshold
algorithm, and we show that our success probability is the best possible for
any single-threshold algorithm under random observation order. Moreover, we
prove that one can achieve a strictly better success probability using more

generate the maximum value. We also extend our results to the problem of

networks (DNN), consisting of two or more hidden layers with large number of
nodes, are being suggested as an alternate to commonly used single-hidden-layer
neural networks (ANN). DNN are found to be flexible models with a very large
number of parameters, thus making them capable of modelling very complex and
highly nonlinear relationships existing between inputs and outputs. This paper
investigates the potential of a DNN consisting of 3 hidden layers (100, 80 and
50 nodes) to predict the local scour around bridge piers using field data. To
update the weights and bias of DNN, an adaptive learning rate optimization
algorithm was used. The dataset consists of 232 pier scour measurements, out of
which a total of 154 data were used to train whereas remaining 78 data to test
the created model. A correlation coefficient value of 0.957 (root mean square
error = 0.306m) was achieved by DNN in comparison to 0.938 (0.388m) by ANN,
indicating an improved performance by DNN for scour depth perdition.
Encouraging performance on the used dataset in the work suggests the need of
more studies on the use of DNN for various civil engineering applications.

network which can be transformed, using dummy processes, into a series of
parallel networks. In the second property, we consider a direct network
combined with series and parallel structure. In this paper, we propose new
models to measure the overall MPSS of the production systems and their internal
processes. MPSS decomposition is discussed and examined. As a real-life
application, this study measures the efficiency and MPSS of research and
development (R&D) activities of Chinese provinces within an R&D value chain
network. In the R&D value chain, profitability and marketability stages are
connected in series, where the profitability stage is composed of operation and
R&D efforts connected in parallel. The MPSS network model provides not only the
MPSS measurement but also values that indicate the appropriate degree of
intermediate measures for the two stages. Improvement strategy is given for
each region based on the gap between the current and the appropriate level of
intermediate measures. Our findings show that the marketability efficiency
values of Chinese R&D regions were low, and no regions are operated under the
MPSS. As a result, most Chinese regions performed inefficiently regarding both
profitability and marketability. This finding provides initial evidence that
the generally lower profitability and marketability efficiency of Chinese
regions is a severe problem that may be due to wasted resources on production
and R&D.

the infrared excess (IRX) method gives the best SFR estimates, consistent with

which can be considered as a vital part of today's global economy:
self-regulation enforced by self-regulation organizations to govern industry
practices, and government regulation which is considered as another scheme to
sustain corporate adherence. An outstanding problem of particular interest is
to understand quantitatively the role of these regulation schemes in
evolutionary dynamics. Typically, punishment usually occurs for enforcement of
regulations. Taking into account both types of punishments to curve the
regulations, we develop a game model where six evolutionary situations with
corresponding combinations of strategies are considered. Furthermore, a
semi-analytical method is developed to allow us to give an accurate estimations
of the boundaries between the phases of full defection and nondefection. We
find that, associated with the evolutionary dynamics, for infinite well-mixed
population, the mix of both punishments performs better than one punishment
alone in promoting public cooperation, but for networked population the
cooperator-driven punishment turns out to be a better choice. We also uncover
monotonous facilitating effects of synergy effect, punishment fine and feedback
sensitivity on the public cooperation for infinite well-mixed population.
Conversely, for networked population an optimal intermediate range of feedback
sensitivity is needed to best promote punishers' populations. Overall,
networked structure is overall more favorable for punishers and further for
public cooperation, because of both network reciprocity and mutualism between
punishers and cooperators who do not punish defectors.

Models for large panels of time series. Specifically, we consider the case in
which the autocorrelation of the factors is explicitly accounted for, and
therefore the model has a state-space form. Estimation of the factors and their
loadings is implemented through the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm,
jointly with the Kalman smoother.~We prove that as both the dimension of the
panel $n$ and the sample size $T$ diverge to infinity, up to logarithmic terms:
(i) the estimated loadings are $\sqrt T$-consistent and asymptotically normal
if $\sqrt T/n\to 0$; (ii) the estimated factors are $\sqrt n$-consistent and
asymptotically normal if $\sqrt n/T\to 0$; (iii) the estimated common component
is $\min(\sqrt n,\sqrt T)$-consistent and asymptotically normal regardless of
the relative rate of divergence of $n$ and $T$. Although the model is estimated
as if the idiosyncratic terms were cross-sectionally and serially uncorrelated
and normally distributed, we show that these mis-specifications do not affect
consistency. Moreover, the estimated loadings are asymptotically as efficient
as those obtained with the Principal Components estimator, while the estimated
factors are more efficient if the idiosyncratic covariance is sparse enough.~We
then propose robust estimators of the asymptotic covariances, which can be used
to conduct inference on the loadings and to compute confidence intervals for
the factors and common components. Finally, we study the performance of our
estimators and we compare them with the traditional Principal Components
approach through MonteCarlo simulations and analysis of US macroeconomic data.

extraction column, a charcoal trap, and a radon detector. In this article we
discuss the design, calibration, and performance of the radon extraction
column. We also describe the design of the measurement system and evaluate its
performance, including its background. Using this system we measured the radon
concentration in Super-Kamiokande's water between May 2014 and October 2015.
The measured radon concentration in the supply lines of the water circulation
system was $1.74\pm0.14~\mathrm{mBq/m^{3}}$ and in the return line was
$9.06\pm0.58~\mathrm{mBq/m^{3}}$. Water sampled from the center region of the
detector itself had a concentration of $<0.23~\mathrm{mBq/m^{3}}$ ($95\%$ C.L.)
and water sampled from the bottom region of the detector had a concentration of
$2.63\pm0.22~\mathrm{mBq/m^{3}}$.

planetary science. Asteroids, comets, and planetary moons yield important
information about the evolution of the Solar System. Additionally, they could
provide resources for a future space economy. While much research has gone into
exploring asteroids and comets, dedicated spacecraft missions to planetary
moons are few and far between. There are three fundamental challenges of a
spacecraft mission to the planetary moons: The first challenge is that the
spheres of influence of most moons (except that of Earth) are small and, in
many cases, virtually absent. The second is that many moons are tidally locked
to their planets, which means that an observer on the planet will have an
entire hemisphere, which is always inaccessible. The third challenge is that at
a given time about half of the region will be in the Sun's shadow. Therefore, a
single spacecraft mission to observe the planetary moon cannot provide complete
coverage. Such a complex task can be solved using a swarm approach, where the
mapping task is delegated to multiple low-cost spacecraft. Clearly, the design
of a swarm mission for such a dynamic environment is challenging. For this
reason, we have proposed the Integrated Design Engineering & Automation of
Swarms (IDEAS) software to perform automated end-to-end design of swarm
missions. Specifically, it will use a sub-module known as the Automated Swarm
Designer module to find optimal swarm configurations suited for a given

in space requires developing a space economy. One important challenge with this
space-economy is ensuring the low-cost transport of raw materials from one
gravity-well to another. The escape delta-v of 11.2 km/s from Earth makes this
proposition very expensive. Transporting materials from the Moon takes 2.4 km/s
and from Mars 5.0 km/s. Based on these factors, the Moon and Mars can become
colonies to export material into this space economy. One critical question is
what are the resources required to sustain a space economy? Water has been
identified as a critical resource both to sustain human-life but also for use
in propulsion, attitude-control, power, thermal storage and radiation
protection systems. Water may be obtained off-world through In-Situ Resource
Utilization (ISRU) in the course of human or robotic space exploration. Based
upon these important findings, we developed an energy model to determine the
feasibility of developing a mining base on Mars that mines and exports water
(transports water on a Mars escape trajectory). Our designs for a mining base
utilize renewable energy sources namely photovoltaics and solar-thermal
concentrators to provide power to construct the base, keep it operational and
export the water using a mass driver (electrodynamic railgun). Our studies
found the key to keeping the mining base simple and effective is to make it
robotic. Teams of robots (consisting of 100 infrastructure robots) would be
used to construct the entire base using locally available resources and fully
operate the base. This would decrease energy needs by 5-folds. Furthermore, the
base can be built 5-times faster using robotics and 3D printing. This shows
that automation and robotics is the key to making such a base technologically
feasible.

no significant effect due to variations in frictional models. Plastic and
frictional heating were found to have a minimal effect on the deformation of
the surface, with the rapid conduction of heat preventing any highly localised
heating. There was no corresponding effect on the predicted galling frequency
response.
  Isothermal, elevated temperature conditions caused a decrease in galling
resistance, driven by the temperature sensitivity of the critical resolved
shear stress. The extent of deformation, as quantified by the area of
plastically deformed material and plastic reach, increased with temperature.
Comparisons were made with literature results for several surface amplitude and
wavelength conditions. Model results compared favourably with those in the
literature. However, the reduction in predicted galling resistance with
elevated temperature for a fixed surface was not as severe as observations in
the literature, suggesting other mechanisms (e.g. phase transformations,
surface coatings and oxides) are likely important.

domains. They share the same parametric form with their non-truncated

normalizing constants is usually infeasible, Maximum Likelihood Estimation
cannot be easily applied to estimate truncated density models. Score Matching
(SM) is a powerful tool for fitting parameters using only unnormalized models.
However, it cannot be directly applied here as boundary conditions used to
derive a tractable SM objective are not satisfied by truncated densities. In
this paper, we study parameter estimation for truncated probability densities
using SM. The estimator minimizes a weighted Fisher divergence. The weight
function is simply the shortest distance from a data point to the boundary of
the domain. We show this choice of weight function naturally arises from
minimizing the Stein discrepancy as well as upperbounding the finite-sample
estimation error. The usefulness of our method is demonstrated by numerical
experiments and a study on the Chicago crime data set. We also show that the

aggressive outlier detection methods.

to associate people across camera views at different locations and time. View
variability is always a challenging problem seriously degrading person

of our knowledge, VCFL is originally proposed to learn view-invariant
identity-wise features, and it is a kind of combination of view-generic and
view-specific methods. Classifiers and feature centers are utilized to achieve
view confusion. Furthermore, we extract sift-guided features by using
bag-of-words model to help supervise the training of deep networks and enhance
the view invariance of features. In experiments, our approach is validated on
three benchmark datasets including CUHK01, CUHK03, and MARKET1501, which show

efficiency. Nanostructured sapphire substrates in aluminum nitride based LED
devices have recently shown to improve crystal growth properties, while their
impact on light extraction has not been fully verified. We present a model for
understanding the impact of nanostructures on the light extraction capability
of DUV-LEDs. The model assumes an isotropic light source in the semiconductor
layer stack and combines rigorously computed scattering matrices with a
multilayer solver. We find that the optical benefit of using a nanopatterned as
opposed to a planar sapphire substrate to be negligible, if parasitic
absorption in the p-side of the LED is dominant. If losses in the p-side are
reduced to 20%, then for a wavelength of 265 nm an increase of light extraction
efficiency from 7.8% to 25.0% is possible due to nanostructuring. We introduce
a concept using a diffuse ('Lambertian') reflector as p-contact, further
increasing the light extraction efficiency to 34.2%. The results underline that
transparent p-sides and reflective p-contacts in DUV-LEDs are indispensable for
enhanced light extraction regardless of the interface texture between

However, learning from different sensor modalities is difficult, because the

this paper, a multimodal variational autoencoder is proposed to enable an iCub
humanoid robot to learn representations of its sensorimotor capabilities from
different sensor modalities. The proposed model is able to (1) reconstruct
missing sensory modalities, (2) predict the sensorimotor state of self and the
visual trajectories of other agents actions, and (3) control the agent to
imitate an observed visual trajectory. Also, the proposed multimodal
variational autoencoder can capture the kinematic redundancy of the robot
motion through the learned probability distribution. Training multimodal models
is not trivial due to the combinatorial complexity given by the possibility of
missing modalities. We propose a strategy to train multimodal models, which
successfully achieves improved performance of different reconstruction models.
Finally, extensive experiments have been carried out using an iCub humanoid
robot, showing high performance in multiple reconstruction, prediction and
imitation tasks.

learning, but require small policy updates to ensure that the proxy objective

derive an alternative objective that obtains the value of the target policy by
applying importance sampling (IS). However, the basic importance sampled
objective is not suitable for policy optimization, as it incurs too high
variance in policy updates. We therefore introduce an approximation that allows
us to directly trade-off the bias of approximation with the variance in policy
updates. We show that our approximation unifies previously developed approaches
and allows us to interpolate between them. We develop a practical algorithm by
optimizing the introduced objective with proximal policy optimization
techniques (Schulman et al., 2017). We also provide a theoretical analysis of
the introduced policy optimization objective demonstrating bias-variance
trade-off. We empirically demonstrate that the resulting algorithm improves

advanced driver assistant systems (ADAS) to fully autonomous vehicles (AVs). In

pose estimation, i.e. those relying on deep Convolutional Neural Networks

cyclists, we assume that they follow traffic rules to indicate future maneuvers
with arm signals. In the case of pedestrians, no indications can be assumed.
Instead, we hypothesize that the walking pattern of a pedestrian allows to
determine if he/she has the intention of crossing the road in the path of the
ego-vehicle, so that the ego-vehicle must maneuver accordingly (e.g. slowing
down or stopping). In this paper, we show how the same methodology can be used

evolution and star-forming histories of galaxies. However, galaxies with
molecular gas maps of their whole discs having sufficient resolution to
distinguish galactic structures are severely lacking. Millimeter wavelength
studies at a high angular resolution across multiple lines and transitions are
particularly needed, severely limiting our ability to infer the universal
properties of molecular gas in galaxies. Hence, we conducted a legacy project
with the 45 m telescope of the Nobeyama Radio Observatory, called the CO
Multi-line Imaging of Nearby Galaxies (COMING), which simultaneously observed
147 galaxies with high far-infrared flux in $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O
$J=1-0$ lines. The total molecular gas mass was derived using the standard
CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor and found to be positively correlated with the
total stellar mass derived from the WISE $3.4 \mu$m band data. The fraction of
the total molecular gas mass to the total stellar mass in galaxies does not
depend on their Hubble types nor the existence of a galactic bar, although when
galaxies in individual morphological types are investigated separately, the
fraction seems to decrease with the total stellar mass in early-type galaxies
and vice versa in late-type galaxies. No differences in the distribution of the
total molecular gas mass, stellar mass, and the total molecular gas to stellar
mass ratio was observed between barred and non-barred galaxies, which is likely
the result of our sample selection criteria, in that we prioritized observing
FIR bright (and thus molecular gas-rich) galaxies.

wireless network edge so as to leverage massive mobile data for enabling
intelligent applications. The mainstream edge learning approach, federated
learning, has been developed based on distributed gradient descent. Based on
the approach, stochastic gradients are computed at edge devices and then
transmitted to an edge server for updating a global AI model. Since each
stochastic gradient is typically high-dimensional (with millions to billions of
coefficients), communication overhead becomes a bottleneck for edge learning.
To address this issue, we propose in this work a novel framework of
hierarchical stochastic gradient quantization and study its effect on the
learning performance. First, the framework features a practical hierarchical
architecture for decomposing the stochastic gradient into its norm and
normalized block gradients, and efficiently quantizes them using a uniform
quantizer and a low-dimensional codebook on a Grassmann manifold, respectively.
Subsequently, the quantized normalized block gradients are scaled and cascaded
to yield the quantized normalized stochastic gradient using a so-called hinge
vector designed under the criterion of minimum distortion. The hinge vector is
also efficiently compressed using another low-dimensional Grassmannian
quantizer. The other feature of the framework is a bit-allocation scheme for
reducing the quantization error. The scheme determines the resolutions of the
low-dimensional quantizers in the proposed framework. The framework is proved
to guarantee model convergency by analyzing the convergence rate as a function
of the quantization bits. Furthermore, by simulation, our design is shown to
substantially reduce the communication overhead compared with the
state-of-the-art signSGD scheme, while both achieve similar learning
accuracies.

a data distribution and a model distribution. Recently, a popular choice for
the similarity measure has been the Wasserstein metric, which can be expressed
in the Kantorovich duality formulation as the optimum difference of the
expected values of a potential function under the real data distribution and
the model hypothesis. In practice, the potential is approximated with a neural
network and is called the discriminator. Duality constraints on the function
class of the discriminator are enforced approximately, and the expectations are
estimated from samples. This gives at least three sources of errors: the
approximated discriminator and constraints, the estimation of the expectation
value, and the optimization required to find the optimal potential. In this
work, we study how well the methods, that are used in generative adversarial
networks to approximate the Wasserstein metric, perform. We consider, in
particular, the $c$-transform formulation, which eliminates the need to enforce
the constraints explicitly. We demonstrate that the $c$-transform allows for a
more accurate estimation of the true Wasserstein metric from samples, but
surprisingly, does not perform the best in the generative setting.

models with delay, the delayed channels are low-dimensional and accounting for
this heterogeneity is not possible in the DDE framework. In addition, DDEs
cannot be used to model difference equations. Furthermore, estimation and
control of systems in DDE format has proven challenging, despite decades of
study. In this paper, we examine alternative representations for systems with
delay and provide formulae for conversion between representations. First, we
examine the Differential-Difference (DDF) formulation which allows us to
represent the low-dimensional nature of delayed information. Next, we examine
the coupled ODE-PDE formulation, for which backstepping methods have recently
become available. Finally, we consider the algebraic Partial-Integral Equation
(PIE) representation, which allows the optimal estimation and control problems
to be solved efficiently through the use of recent software packages such as
PIETOOLS. In each case, we consider a very general class of delay systems,
specifically accounting for all four possible sources of delay - state delay,
input delay, output delay, and process delay. We then apply these
representations to 3 archetypical network models.

framework, capable of automatically performing an adaptive simulation in the
context of second- and fourth-order, elliptic partial differential equations
defined on two-dimensional trimmed domains. The method is steered by an a
posteriori error estimator, which is computed with the aid of an auxiliary
residual-like problem formulated onto a space spanned by splines with single
element support. The local refinement of the basis is achieved thanks to the
use of truncated hierarchical B-splines. We prove numerically the applicability
of the proposed estimator to various engineering-relevant problems, namely the
Poisson problem, linear elasticity and Kirchhoff-Love shells, formulated on
trimmed geometries. In particular, we study several benchmark problems which
exhibit both smooth and singular solutions, where we recover optimal asymptotic
rates of convergence for the error measured in the energy norm and we observe a
substantial increase in accuracy per-degree-of-freedom compared to uniform
refinement. Lastly, we show the applicability of our framework to the adaptive
shell analysis of an industrial-like trimmed geometry modeled in the commercial
software Rhinoceros, which represents the B-pillar of a car.

either the asymptotic or non-asymptotic regimes. In this paper, we provide a
bridge between these two regimes, by determining second-order coding rates for
key distillation in quantum key distribution under collective attacks. Our main
result is a formula that characterizes the backoff from the known asymptotic
formula for key distillation -- our formula incorporates the reliability and
security of the protocol, as well as the mutual information variances to the
legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. In order to determine secure key
rates against collective attacks, one should perform a joint optimization of
the Holevo information and the Holevo information variance to the eavesdropper.
We show how to do so by analyzing several examples, including the six-state,
BB84, and continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocols (the last
involving Gaussian modulation of coherent states along with heterodyne
detection). The technical contributions of this paper include one-shot and
second-order analyses of private communication over a compound quantum wiretap
channel with fixed marginal and key distillation over a compound quantum
wiretap source with fixed marginal. We also establish the second-order
asymptotics of the smooth max-relative entropy of quantum states acting on a
separable Hilbert space, and we derive a formula for the Holevo information

the functionality of this approach, we present a case study of the Hydrogen

extremely large number of data points in the coordinate space, and so the

and antimatter in the universe. Sakharov proposed that an explanation would
require the violation of CP symmetry between matter and antimatter. The only CP
violation observed so far is in the weak interactions of quarks, and it is too
small to explain the matter-antimatter imbalance of the universe. It has been
shown that CP violation in the lepton sector could generate the
matter-antimatter disparity through the process called leptogenesis. The
quantum mixing of neutrinos, the neutral leptons in the Standard Model,
provides a potential source of CP violation through a complex phase dCP, which
may have consequences for theoretical models of leptogenesis. This CP violation
can be measured in muon neutrino to electron neutrino oscillations and the
corresponding antineutrino oscillations, which are experimentally accessible
with accelerator-produced beams as established by the T2K experiment. Until
now, the value of dCP has not been significantly constrained by neutrino
oscillation experiments. Here the T2K collaboration reports a measurement that
favors large enhancement of the neutrino oscillation probability, excluding
values of dCP which result in a large enhancement of the observed anti-neutrino
oscillation probability at three standard deviations (3 sigma). The 3 sigma
confidence level interval for dCP, which is cyclic and repeats every 2pi, is
[-3.41,-0.03] for the so-called normal mass ordering, and [-2.54,-0.32] for the
inverted mass ordering. Our results show an indication of CP violation in the
lepton sector. Herein we establish methods for sensitive searches for
matter-antimatter asymmetry in neutrino oscillations using accelerator-produced
neutrino beams. Future measurements with larger data samples will determine
whether the leptonic CP violation is larger than the quark sector CP violation.

this, we have began updating the three-dimensional (3D) non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative transfer code, Multi3D, and the equivalent
one-dimensional (1D) non-LTE radiative transfer code, MULTI. Aims. We examine
our improvements to these codes by redetermining the solar barium abundance.
Barium was chosen for this test as it is an important diagnostic element of the
s-process in the context of galactic chemical evolution. New Ba II + H
collisional data for excitation and charge exchange reactions computed from
first principles had recently become available and were included in the model
atom. The atom also includes the effects of isotopic line shifts and hyperfine
splitting. Method. A grid of 1D LTE barium lines were constructed with MULTI
and fit to the four Ba II lines available to us in the optical region of the
solar spectrum. Abundance corrections were then determined in 1D non-LTE, 3D
LTE, and 3D non-LTE. A new 3D non-LTE solar barium abundance was computed from
these corrections. Results. We present for the first time the full 3D non-LTE
barium abundance of $A({\rm Ba})=2.27\pm0.02\pm0.01$, which was derived from
four individual fully consistent barium lines. Errors here represent the
systematic and random errors, respectively.

levitate solid particles without any moving parts but only at the scale of 1-20

to realize photophoretic levitation at the millimeter to centimeter scales.
Instead of creating lift through conventional rotors or wings, our levitation
occurs due to light-induced thermal transpiration through micro-channels within
our plates. At atmospheric pressure, the plates hover above a solid substrate
at heights of ~0.5 mm by creating an air cushion beneath the plate. Moreover,
at reduced pressures (10-1000 Pa), the increased speed of thermal transpiration
through the plate's channels creates an air jet that enables mid-air levitation
and allows the plates to carry small payloads heavier than the plates
themselves. This new propulsion mechanism for macroscopic structures creates
the prospect of future nanotechnology-enabled flying vehicles without any

conditions for planet formation and migration near the dust sublimation front
in protostellar disks around young Sun-like stars. For this analysis we use
iterative 2D radiation hydrostatic disk models which include irradiation by the
star, and dust sublimation and deposition depending on the local temperature
and vapor pressure. We perform a parameter study by varying the magnetized
turbulence onset temperature, the accretion stress, the dust mass fraction, and
the mass accretion rate. Our models feature a gas-only inner disk, a silicate
sublimation front and dust rim starting at around 0.08 au, an ionization
transition zone with a corresponding density jump, and a pressure maximum which
acts as a pebble trap at around 0.12 au. Migration torque maps show Earth- and
super-Earth-mass planets halt in our model disks at orbital periods ranging
from 10 to 22 days. Such periods are in good agreement with both the inferred
location of the innermost planets in multiplanetary systems, and the break in
planet occurrence rates from the Kepler sample at 10 days. In particular,
models with small grains depleted produce a trap located at a 10-day orbital
period, while models with a higher abundance of small grains present a trap at
around a 17-day orbital period. The snow line lies at 1.6 au, near where the
occurrence rate of the giant planets peaks. We conclude that the dust
sublimation zone is crucial for forming close-in planets, especially when

quantum spin-Hall effect of light was introduced for surface plane-waves which
intrinsically carry transverse optical spin, leading to many intriguing
phenomena and applications in unidirectional waveguiding, metrology and quantum
technologies. In addition to spin, optical waves can exhibit complex
topological properties of vectorial electromagnetic fields, associated with
orbital angular momentum or nonuniform intensity variations. Here, by
considering both spin and angular momentum, we demonstrate a generalized

two-dimensional vector field of structured guided wave. The effect results in
the appearance of the out-of-plane transverse optical spins, which vary
progressively from the 'up' state to the 'down' state around the energy flow,
and their variation is uniquely locked to the energy propagation direction. The
related spin-momentum locking in a chiral spin swirl is demonstrated with four
kinds of surface structured waves and proven both theoretically and
experimentally. The results provide understanding of the spin dynamics in
electromagnetic guided waves and show great importance in spin optics,

learns a discriminative space where within class samples collapse to singular

dimensional mappings to kernel space is used to obtain better cross-view

an approximate extended Kalman filtering scheme, which makes the resulting
method particularly efficient. PSMF can account for temporal nonlinearities

simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system, especially for the large
scale environment. The ever-growing map prevents long-term mapping. In this
paper, we developed a compact cognitive mapping approach inspired by
neurobiological experiments. Inspired from neighborhood cells, neighborhood
fields determined by movement information, i.e. translation and rotation, are
proposed to describe one of distinct segments of the explored environment. The
vertices and edges with movement information below the threshold of the
neighborhood fields are avoided adding to the cognitive map. The optimization
of the cognitive map is formulated as a robust non-linear least squares
problem, which can be efficiently solved by the fast open linear solvers as a
general problem. According to the cognitive decision-making of familiar
environments, loop closure edges are clustered depending on time intervals, and
then parallel computing is applied to perform batch global optimization of the
cognitive map for ensuring the efficiency of computation and real-time
performance. After the loop closure process, scene integration is performed, in
which revisited vertices are removed subsequently to further reduce the size of
the cognitive map. A monocular visual SLAM system is developed to test our
approach in a rat-like maze environment. Our results suggest that the method
largely restricts the growth of the size of the cognitive map over time, and
meanwhile, the compact cognitive map correctly represents the overall layer of
the environment as the standard one. Experiments demonstrate that our method is
very suited for compact cognitive mapping to support long-term robot mapping.
Our approach is simple, but pragmatic and efficient for achieving the compact
cognitive map.

propose to use self-supervised learning to achieve domain generalization and
adaptation. We consider learning regularities from non annotated data as an
auxiliary task, and cast the problem within an Auxiliary Learning principled
framework. Moreover, we suggest to further exploit the ability to learn about
visual domains from non annotated images by learning from target data while
testing, as data are presented to the algorithm one sample at a time. Results
on three different scenarios confirm the value of our approach.

  We thus propose Deep Latent Defence, an architecture which seeks to combine

has a adversarially trained neural network. A series of encoders take the
intermediate layer representation of data as it passes though the network and
project it to a latent space which we use for detecting adversarial samples via
a $k$-nn classifier. We present results using both grey and white box

Existing models of indirect reciprocity fail to robustly support social

social standing models are not informationally robust. Here we provide a new
model of indirect reciprocity based on simple, decentralized records: each
individual's record depends on their own past behavior alone, and not on their
partners' past behavior or their partners' partners' past behavior. When social
dilemmas exhibit a coordination motive (or strategic complementarity), tolerant
trigger strategies based on simple records can robustly support positive social
cooperation and exhibit strong stability properties. In the opposite case of
strategic substitutability, positive social cooperation cannot be robustly
supported. Thus, the strength of short-run coordination motives in social

proposed. We elaborate on one of the algorithms, by Lehtinen (2018).
  Czerwi\'nski et al. (2019) observe that four of the algorithms can be
expressed as constructions of separating automata (of quasi-polynomial size),
that is, automata that accept all plays decisively won by one of the players,
and rejecting all plays decisively won by the other player. The separating
automata corresponding to three of the algorithms are deterministic, and it is
clear that deterministic separating automata can be used to solve parity games.
The separating automaton corresponding to the algorithm of Lehtinen is
nondeterministic, though. While this particular automaton can be used to solve
parity games, this is not true for every nondeterministic separating automaton.
As a first (more conceptual) contribution, we specify when a nondeterministic
separating automaton can be used to solve parity games.
  We also repeat the correctness proof of the Lehtinen's algorithm, using
separating automata. In this part, we prove that her construction actually
leads to a faster algorithm than originally claimed in her paper: its
complexity is $n^{O(\log n)}$ rather than $n^{O(\log d \cdot \log n)}$ (where
$n$ is the number of nodes, and $d$ the number of priorities of a considered

extracellular environment where it accumulates. Depending on the initial
carbohydrate concentration in the wort a high concentration of ethanol can be
achieved in beer, often higher than 20% (v/v). It is noteworthy that the
effects of elevated ethanol concentrations generated during beer fermentation
resemble those of heat shock stress, with similar responses observed in both
situations, such as the activation of proteostasis and protein quality control
mechanisms in different cell compartments, including endoplasmic reticulum
(ER), mitochondria, and cytosol. Despite the extensive published molecular and
biochemical data regarding the roles of proteostasis in different organelles of
yeast cells, little is known about how this mechanism impacts beer fermentation
and how different proteostasis mechanisms found in ER, mitochondria, and
cytosol communicate with each other during ethanol/fermentative stress.
Supporting this integrative view, transcriptome data analysis was applied using
publicly available information for a lager yeast strain grown under in beer
production conditions. The transcriptome data indicated upregulation of genes
that encode chaperones, co-chaperones, unfolded protein response elements in ER

an emerging field of research. While numerical approaches (using replicator
dynamics) are dime a dozen, analytical approaches are rare. A particularly
useful analytical approach is to utilize a mapping between the spin-1/2 Ising
model in 1-D and the social dilemma game and calculate the magnetization, which
is the net difference between the fraction of cooperators and defectors in a
social dilemma. In this paper, we look at the susceptibility, which probes the
net change in the fraction of players adopting a certain strategy, for both
classical and quantum social dilemmas. The reason being, in statistical
mechanics problems, the thermodynamic susceptibility as compared to
magnetization is a more sensitive probe for microscopic behavior, e.g.,
observing small changes in a population adopting a certain strategy. In this
paper, we find the thermodynamic susceptibility for reward, sucker's payoff and
temptation in classical Prisoner's Dilemma to be positive, implying that the
turnover from defect to cooperate is greater than vice-versa, although the Nash
Equilibrium for the two-player game is to defect. In classical Hawk-Dove game,
the thermodynamic susceptibility for resource suggests that the number of
players switching to Hawk from Dove strategy is dominant. Entanglement in
Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma (QPD) has a non-trivial role in determining the
behavior of thermodynamic susceptibility. At maximal entanglement, we find that
sucker's payoff and temptation increase the number of players switching to
defect. In the zero-temperature limit, we find that there are two second-order
phase transitions in the game, marked by a divergence in the susceptibility.
This behavior is similar to that seen in Type-II superconductors wherein also
two second-order phase transitions are seen.

self-assembling tiles and the impacts that three diverse properties have on
their dynamics. We expand upon a series of prior results which showed that (1)
the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) is intrinsically universal (IU) [FOCS
2012], and (2) the class of directed aTAM systems is not IU [FOCS 2016]. IU for
a model (or class of systems within a model) means that there is a universal
tile set which can be used to simulate an arbitrary system within that model
(or class). Furthermore, the simulation must not only produce the same
resultant structures, it must also maintain the full dynamics of the systems
being simulated modulo only a scale factor. While the FOCS 2012 result showed
the standard, two-dimensional (2D) aTAM is IU, here we show this is also the
case for the 3D version. Conversely, the FOCS 2016 result showed the class of
aTAM systems which are directed (a.k.a. deterministic, or confluent) is not IU,
implying that nondeterminism is fundamentally required for such simulations.
Here, however, we show that in 3D the class of directed aTAM systems is
actually IU, i.e. there is a universal directed simulator for them. We then
consider the influence of more rigid notions of dimensionality. Namely, we
introduce the Planar aTAM, where tiles are not only restricted to binding in
the plane, but also to traveling in the plane, and prove that the Planar aTAM
is not IU, and that the class of directed systems within the Planar aTAM also
is not IU. Finally, analogous to the Planar aTAM, we introduce the Spatial
aTAM, its 3D counterpart, and prove that it is IU.
  To prove our positive results we have not only designed, but also implemented
what we believe to be the first IU tile set ever implemented and simulated in
any tile assembly model. We've made it and a simulator which can demonstrate it
freely available.

significantly extended our understanding of topological phases of matter. Here,
we predict that second-order corner states can emerge in the dipolar-coupled
dynamics of topological spin textures in two-dimensional artificial crystals.
Taking a breathing honeycomb lattice of magnetic vortices as an example, we
derive the full phase diagram of collective vortex gyrations and identify three
types of corner states that have not been discovered before. We show that the
topological ""zero-energy"" corner modes are protected by a generalized chiral
symmetry in the sexpartite lattice, leading to particular robustness against
disorder and defects, although the conventional chiral symmetry of bipartite
lattices is absent. We propose the use of the quantized $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ Berry
phase to characterize the nontrivial topology. Interestingly, we observe corner
states at either obtuse-angled or acute-angled corners, depending on whether
the lattice boundary has an armchair or zigzag shape. Full micromagnetic
simulations confirm the theoretical predictions with good agreement.
Experimentally, we suggest using the recently developed ultrafast Lorentz
microscopy technique [M\""{o}ller \emph{et al}.,{arXiv:1907.04608}] to detect
the topological corner states by tracking the nanometer-scale vortex orbits in
a time-resolved manner. Our findings open up a promising route for realizing
higher-order topologically protected corner states in magnetic systems and
finally achieving topological spintronic memory and computing.

also it modifies the Ru charge state and electronic density. Our studies show
that Ga$^{3+}$ substitution does not affect the original
orthorhombic-\textit{Pbnm} structure of SrRuO$_3$ which is due to its matching
ionic radii with Ru$^{4+}$. However, Ga$^{3+}$ has a substantial effect on the
magnetic behavior of SrRuO$_3$ where it decreases both magnetic moment as well
as magnetic transition temperature $T_c$. Further, this dilution induces
Griffiths phase behavior across $T_c$ and cluster-glass behavior at low
temperature with higher concentration of doping. The magnetic critical exponent
$\beta$ increases with $x$ due to this site dilution effect. The Ga$^{3+}$
induces an insulating state in SrRuO$_3$ with $x$ $>$ 0.05. The charge
transport in paramagnetic as well as in insulating state of samples can be well
described with Mott's modified variable-range-hopping model. The metallic
charge transport just below $T_c$ in SrRuO$_3$ obeys Fermi liquid behavior

equations in the absence of noise. The method of input-output equations is one
method for verifying structural identifiability. This method stands out in its
importance because the additional insights it provides can be used to analyze
and improve models. However, its complete theoretical grounds and applicability
are still to be established. A subtlety and key for this method to work
correctly is knowing whether the coefficients of these equations are

of input-output equations for types of differential models that often appear in
practice, such as linear models with one output and linear compartment models
in which, from each compartment, one can reach either a leak or an input. This
shows that checking identifiability via input-output equations for these models
is legitimate and, as we prove, that the field of identifiable functions is
generated by the coefficients of the input-output equations. Finally, we
exploit a connection between input-output equations and the transfer function
matrix to show that, for a linear compartment model with an input and strongly
connected graph, the field of all identifiable functions is generated by the
coefficients of the transfer function matrix even if the initial conditions are

Sc$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$Co with the space group of $Pm$-$3m$. Both the resistivity

K. This transition might be attributed to the establishment of an
antiferromagnetic order. The magnetization hysteresis loop measurements in wide
temperature region show a weak ferromagnetic feature, which suggests a possible
canted arrangement of the magnetic moments. Bounded by the phase transition
temperature, the resistivity at ambient pressure shows a change from Fermi
liquid behavior to a super-linear behavior as temperature increases. By
applying pressures up to 32.1 GPa, the transition temperature does not show a
clear change and no superconductivity is observed above 2 K. The density

antiferromagnetic order and reveal a gap between the spin-up and spin-down

pattern speed in isolated disk galaxies using N-body simulations. Earlier
studies have shown that disk stars at the inner resonances can transfer a
significant amount of angular momentum to the dark matter halo and this results
in the slow down of the bar pattern speed. In this paper we investigate how the
mass of the other spheroidal component, the bulge, affects bar pattern speeds.
In our galaxy models the initial bars are all rotating fast as the R parameter,
which is the ratio of the corotation radius to bar radius is less than 1.4,
which is typical of fast bars. However, as the galaxies evolve with time, the
bar pattern speed (${\Omega}_p$ ) slows down leading to R $>$1.4 for all the
models except for the model with the most massive bulge, in which the bar
formed late and did not have time to evolve. The rapid slowdown of ${\Omega}_p$
is due to the larger angular momentum transfer from the disk to the bulge, and
is due to interactions between stars at the inner resonances and those in the
bar. Hence we conclude that the decrease in ${\Omega}_p$ clearly depends on
bulge mass in barred galaxies and decreases faster for galaxies with more
massive bulges. We discuss the implications of our results for observations of
bar pattern speeds in galaxies.

understanding how the emergence of new viral strains and phenotype within

both non-curative treatment and chemo-prophylactic measures. We consider the
within-host emergence of new strains that lack phenotype novelty and also the
evolution of variability in contagiousness, resistance to therapy, and efficacy
of prophylaxis. Our framework balances the need for verisimilitude with our
desire to retain a model that can be approached analytically. We show how to
compute the population-level basic reproduction number accounting for the
within-host evolutionary process where new phenotypes emerge and are lost in
infected persons, which we also extend to include both treatment and
prophylactic control efforts. This allows us to make clear statements about
both the global and relative efficacy of different control efforts accounting

endemic equilibrium of these models for certain constrained versions of the

gaze information for integrating automatic detection systems in the clinical
practice. For that purpose, 4 radiologists were asked to annotate 20 scans from
a public dataset while being monitored by an eye tracker device and an
automatic lung nodule detection system was developed. Our results show that
radiologists follow a similar search routine and tend to have lower fixation
periods in regions where finding errors occur. The overall detection
sensitivity of the specialists was 0.67$\pm$0.07, whereas the system achieved
0.69. Combining the annotations of one radiologist with the automatic system
significantly improves the detection performance to similar levels of two
annotators. Likewise, combining the findings of radiologist with the detection
algorithm only for low fixation regions still significantly improves the
detection sensitivity without increasing the number of false-positives. The
combination of the automatic system with the gaze information allows to
mitigate possible errors of the radiologist without some of the issues usually

$S_\Phi^{1/2}$ on $L$. A comparison between two samples shows that the kinetic
inductance contribution varies strongly with film quality, hence making
inductance measurements a crucial part of the SQUID characterization. Thanks to
the improved estimation of the kinetic inductance contribution, previously
found discrepancies between theoretical estimates and measured values of
$V_{\Phi}$ and $S_\Phi^{1/2}$ could to a large extent be avoided. We then use
the measurements and improved theoretical estimations to optimize the SQUID
geometry and reach a noise level of $S_B^{1/2}$ = 44 fT/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$
for the best SQUID magnetometer with a 8.6 mm $\times$ 9.2 mm directly coupled
pickup loop. Lastly, we demonstrate a method for reliable one-time sensor
calibration that is constant in a temperature range of several kelvin despite
the presence of temperature dependent coupling contributions, such as the
kinetic inductance. The found variability of the kinetic inductance
contribution has implications not only for the design of YBCO SQUID
magnetometers, but for all narrow linewidth SQUID-based devices operated close
to their critical temperature.

long-term evolution of the stellar rotation. Magnetospheric ejections and
accretion powered stellar winds play an important role in the spin evolution of
solar-type stars. However, kG dipolar magnetic fields are not uncommon but not
ubiquitous. Besides, it is unclear how massive stellar winds can be powered,
while numerical models of the propeller regime display a strong variability

more realistic models could contribute to soften our calculations'

substantially improved by choosing smooth high-order basis functions. It is
extremely difficult to devise such basis functions for partitions consisting of

arbitrary order and smoothness for partitions consisting of convex polytopes.
On each polytope an independent local polynomial approximant of arbitrary order
is assumed. The basis functions are defined as the convolutions of the local
approximants with a mollifier. The mollifier is chosen to be smooth, to have a
compact support and a unit volume. The approximation properties of the obtained
basis functions are governed by the local polynomial approximation order and
mollifier smoothness. The convolution integrals are evaluated numerically first
by computing the boolean intersection between the mollifier and the polytope
and then applying the divergence theorem to reduce the dimension of the
integrals. The support of a basis function is given as the Minkowski sum of the
respective polytope and the mollifier. The breakpoints of the basis functions,
i.e. locations with non-infinite smoothness, are not necessarily aligned with
polytope boundaries. Furthermore, the basis functions are not boundary
interpolating so that we apply boundary conditions with the non-symmetric
Nitsche method as in immersed/embedded finite elements. The presented numerical
examples confirm the optimal convergence of the proposed approximation scheme
for Poisson and elasticity problems.

states and the standard Wigner representation. Connections with the free

derived. The formalism also allows the superposition of different theories and

  coarse-grained models via transformed atomistic cross correlations",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coarse-grained (CG) models are often parametrized to reproduce
one-dimensional structural correlation functions of an atomically-detailed
model along the degrees of freedom governing each interaction potential. While
cross correlations between these degrees of freedom inform the optimal set of
interaction parameters, the correlations generated from the higher-resolution
simulations are often too complex to act as an accurate proxy for the CG
correlations. Instead, the most popular methods determine the interaction
parameters iteratively, while assuming that individual interactions are
uncorrelated. While these iterative methods have been validated for a wide
range of systems, they also have disadvantages when parametrizing models for
multi-component systems or when refining previously established models to
better reproduce particular structural features. In this work, we propose two
distinct approaches for the direct (i.e., non-iterative) parametrization of a
CG model by adjusting the high-resolution cross correlations of an atomistic
model in order to more accurately reflect correlations that will be generated
by the resulting CG model. The derived models more accurately describe the
low-order structural features of the underlying AA model, while necessarily
generating inherently distinct cross correlations compared with the
atomically-detailed reference model. We demonstrate the proposed methods for a
one-site-per-molecule representation of liquid water, where pairwise
interactions are incapable of reproducing the true tetrahedral solvation
structure. We then investigate the precise role that distinct cross-correlation
features play in determining the correct pair correlation functions, evaluating
the importance of the placement of correlation features as well as the balance
between features appearing in different solvation shells.

Wolynes, J.\ Chem.\ Phys.\ 87, 6559 (1987)] can be overestimated by orders of
magnitude, whereas the GR-QTST predictions are numerically accurate. This is
the case both at low temperature, where nuclear tunneling makes a considerable
contribution, and also in the classical limit, where only GR-QTST rigorously
tends to the correct result. Analysis shows that the saddle-point approximation
employed by Wolynes theory is not valid in this case, which results in
predictions of unphysical reaction pathways, whilst the energy constraint
employed by GR-QTST resolves this problem. The GR-QTST method is also seen to
give accurate results for a strongly anharmonic system by sampling
configurations around the instanton pathway without making the semiclassical

be an efficient and accurate approach for simulating electron-transfer

several measures to preserve their high quality and to avoid instabilities. The
mitigation of the impact of residual ions is one of these measures. It is
particularly important if high bunch charges in combination with high
repetition rates are aimed for. This is because ions can be trapped in the
strong negative electrical potential of the electron beam causing emittance
blow-up, increased beam halo and longitudinal and transverse instabilities.
  Over the last decades three ion-clearing strategies have been applied to
counteract the degrading impact of the ions on the electron beam. These
strategies are installation of clearing electrodes, introduction of gaps in
filling pattern and beam shaking. Currently, their merit as clearing strategies
for the next generation of high brightness accelerators such as energy recovery
linacs (ERLs) are under intensive investigations by means of numerical and
experimental studies. Of particular interest in this context is the performance
of multi-purpose electrodes, which are designed such that they allow for a
simultaneous ion-clearing and beam-position monitoring. Such electrodes will be
installed in the bERLinPro facility.
  In this paper, we present numerical studies for the behavior of ions
generated by electron bunches while passing through the field of clearing
electrodes. The objective is to investigate the ion motion towards the
electrodes and to study under which circumstances and up to which ratio an
equilibrium between ion-generation and ion-clearing is established. Hereby,
several ion species and configurations of electrodes are considered in
combination with typical beam parameters of high-brightness electron
accelerators. Furthermore, we present detailed numerical studies of the
performance of multi-purpose clearing electrodes planned for bERLinPro.

equations of state supplemented by an ideal fluid thermal component. We find
that the post-merger phase can be subdivided into three phases: an early
post-merger phase (where the quadrupole mode and a few subdominant features are
active), the intermediate post-merger phase (where only the quadrupole mode is
active) and the late post-merger phase (where convective instabilities trigger
inertial modes). The inertial modes have frequencies somewhat smaller than the
quadrupole modes. In one model, we find an interesting association of a
corotation of the quadrupole mode in parts of the star with a revival of its
amplitude. The gravitational wave emission of inertial modes in the late
post-merger phase is concentrated in a narrow frequency region and is
potentially detectable by the planned third-generation detectors. This allows
for the possibility of probing not only the cold part of the equation of state,
but also its dependence on finite temperature. In view of these results, it

the distributed approaches with locally acting nodes are not fully aware of the
end-to-end performance. We instead hierarchically distribute the path
calculation over designated nodes in the network while taking into account the
end-to-end performance. Specifically, we develop a hierarchical
cluster-oriented adaptive per-flow path calculation mechanism by leveraging the
Deep Double Q-network (DDQN) algorithm, where the end-to-end paths are
calculated by the source nodes with the assistance of cluster (group) leaders
at different hierarchical levels. In our approach, a deferred composite reward
is designed to capture the end-to-end performance through a feedback signal
from the source nodes to the group leaders and captures the local network
performance through the local resource assessments by the group leaders. This
approach scales in large networks, adapts to the dynamic demand, utilizes the
network resources efficiently and can be applied to segment routing.

rounder at all radii compared to their dark matter only counterparts. At

extended massive stellar discs and low core gas densities. We measure the
alignment between the halo and the disc shapes at different radii and find a
high degree of alignment at all radii for most of the galaxies. In some cases
the alignment significantly changes as a function of radius implying that the
halo shape twists; this effect correlates with recently formed bulges and is
almost absent in the dark matter only simulations. In a comparison against
observational constraints we find that $20\%$ of halos in our sample are
consistent with observational results derived from the Pal 5 stream that
favours an almost spherical shape. Including baryons is a required element to
achieve this level of agreement. In contrast, none of the simulations (neither

application of these results, we derive an interesting corollary for complete
submanifolds of hyperbolic space with nonpositive extrinsic curvature and
discourse on their relation to Milnor's conjecture about complete surfaces with

Internet (or any large computer network) operational. Network congestion
control has been dominated by hand-crafted heuristics for decades. Recently,
ReinforcementLearning (RL) has emerged as an alternative to automatically
optimize such control strategies. Research so far has primarily considered RL
interfaces which block the sender while an agent considers its next action.
This is largely an artifact of building on top of frameworks designed for RL in
games (e.g. OpenAI Gym). However, this does not translate to real-world
networking environments, where a network sender waiting on a policy without
sending data leads to under-utilization of bandwidth. We instead propose to
formulate congestion control with an asynchronous RL agent that handles delayed
actions. We present MVFST-RL, a scalable framework for congestion control in
the QUIC transport protocol that leverages state-of-the-art in asynchronous RL
training with off-policy correction. We analyze modeling improvements to
mitigate the deviation from Markovian dynamics, and evaluate our method on
emulated networks from the Pantheon benchmark platform. The source code is

problem is exemplified by recent experiments which used proton imaging to probe
the filamentary magnetic field structures produced by the Weibel instability in
collisionless counter-streaming plasmas. In this paper, we perform analytical
and numerical analysis of proton images of systems containing many magnetic

not directly correspond to the spacing between magnetic filaments (the magnetic
wavelength) as has previously been assumed, and that they instead correspond to
the filament size. We demonstrate this result by Fourier analysis of synthetic

For the bilevel program with convex lower level program we discuss drawbacks of

complementarity constraints and present a new sharp necessary optimality
condition for the reformulation by the mathematical program with a generalized

  Tradeoff in Single Image Super-Resolution",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In single image super-resolution (SISR), given a low-resolution (LR) image,
one wishes to find a high-resolution (HR) version of it which is both accurate
and photo-realistic. Recently, it has been shown that there exists a
fundamental tradeoff between low distortion and high perceptual quality, and
the generative adversarial network (GAN) is demonstrated to approach the
perception-distortion (PD) bound effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel
method based on wavelet domain style transfer (WDST), which achieves a better
PD tradeoff than the GAN based methods. Specifically, we propose to use 2D
stationary wavelet transform (SWT) to decompose one image into low-frequency
and high-frequency sub-bands. For the low-frequency sub-band, we improve its
objective quality through an enhancement network. For the high-frequency
sub-band, we propose to use WDST to effectively improve its perceptual quality.
By feat of the perfect reconstruction property of wavelets, these sub-bands can
be re-combined to obtain an image which has simultaneously high objective and
perceptual quality. The numerical results on various datasets show that our
method achieves the best trade-off between the distortion and perceptual
quality among the existing state-of-the-art SISR methods.

Process (MDP) has been investigated in several studies. This paper studies
equivalence structure in the reinforcement learning (RL) setup, where
transition distributions are no longer assumed to be known. We present a notion
of similarity between transition probabilities of various state-action pairs of
an MDP, which naturally defines an equivalence structure in the state-action
space. We present equivalence-aware confidence sets for the case where the
learner knows the underlying structure in advance. These sets are provably
smaller than their corresponding equivalence-oblivious counterparts. In the
more challenging case of an unknown equivalence structure, we present an
algorithm called ApproxEquivalence that seeks to find an (approximate)
equivalence structure, and define confidence sets using the approximate
equivalence. To illustrate the efficacy of the presented confidence sets, we
present C-UCRL, as a natural modification of UCRL2 for RL in undiscounted MDPs.
In the case of a known equivalence structure, we show that C-UCRL improves over
UCRL2 in terms of regret by a factor of $\sqrt{SA/C}$, in any communicating MDP
with $S$ states, $A$ actions, and $C$ classes, which corresponds to a massive
improvement when $C \ll SA$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work providing regret bounds for RL when an equivalence structure in the MDP is
efficiently exploited. In the case of an unknown equivalence structure, we show
through numerical experiments that C-UCRL combined with ApproxEquivalence
outperforms UCRL2 in ergodic MDPs.

because of its solid theoretical rationale and efficient implementations.
Several previous works attempted to directly approximate a pre-trained model by

ripple over a large prediction loss. Apparently, it is not optimal to separate
low-rank approximation from training. Unlike previous works, this paper
integrates low rank approximation and regularization into the training process.
We propose Trained Rank Pruning (TRP), which alternates between low rank
approximation and training. TRP maintains the capacity of the original network
while imposing low-rank constraints during training. A nuclear regularization
optimized by stochastic sub-gradient descent is utilized to further promote low
rank in TRP. Networks trained with TRP has a low-rank structure in nature, and
is approximated with negligible performance loss, thus eliminating fine-tuning
after low rank approximation. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated
on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, outperforming previous compression counterparts using
low rank approximation. Our code is available at:

significantly over many iterations, making it difficult to balance the
privacy-accuracy tradeoff. We propose Recycled ADMM (R-ADMM), where a linear
approximation is applied to every even iteration, its solution directly
calculated using only results from the previous, odd iteration. It turns out
that under such a scheme, half of the updates incur no privacy loss and require
much less computation compared to the conventional ADMM. Moreover, R-ADMM can
be further modified (MR-ADMM) such that each node independently determines its
own penalty parameter over iterations. We obtain a sufficient condition for the
convergence of both algorithms and provide the privacy analysis based on
objective perturbation. It can be shown that the privacy-accuracy tradeoff can
be improved significantly compared with conventional ADMM.

Relativity would not be the ultimate theory of gravity, modifying Einstein's
gravity in the homogeneous and isotropic universe may likely represent a viable
path toward the description of current universe acceleration. We here focus our
attention on two classes of extended theories, i.e. the $f(R)$ and
$f(R,G)$-gravity. We parameterize the so-obtained Hubble function by means of
effective barotropic fluids, by calibrating the shapes of our curves through
some of the most suitable dark energy parameterizations, XCDM, CPL, WP.
Afterwards, by virtue of the correspondence between the Ricci scalar and the
Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant with the redshift $z$, we rewrite $f(R,G)$
in terms of corresponding $f(z)$ auxiliary functions. This scheme enables one
to get numerical shapes for $f(R,G)$ and $f(R)$ models, through a
coarse-grained inverse scattering procedure. Although our procedure agrees with
the simplest extensions of general relativity, it leaves open the possibility
that the most suitable forms of $f(R)$ and $f(R,G)$ are rational Pad\'e

here as the set of cognitive processes underlying the elaboration of a stimulus
by the brain) rely on overlapping neural representations is a fundamental issue
in cognitive neuroscience. In the last decade, the identification of shared
activity patterns has been mostly framed as a supervised learning problem. For
instance, a classifier is trained to discriminate categories (e.g. faces vs.
houses) in modality I (e.g. perception) and tested on the same categories in
modality II (e.g. imagery). This type of analysis is often referred to as
cross-modal decoding. In this paper we take a different approach and instead
formulate the problem of assessing shared patterns across modalities within the
framework of statistical hypothesis testing. We propose both an appropriate
test statistic and a scheme based on permutation testing to compute the
significance of this test while making only minimal distributional assumption.
We denote this test cross-modal permutation test (CMPT). We also provide
empirical evidence on synthetic datasets that our approach has greater
statistical power than the cross-modal decoding method while maintaining low
Type I errors (rejecting a true null hypothesis). We compare both approaches on
an fMRI dataset with three different cognitive modalities (perception, imagery,
visual search). Finally, we show how CMPT can be combined with Searchlight

environment is too challenging to be caught by a closed formula due to the
emerging complexity associated with the randomness in a fading channel. This
leads to contradicting statements about the impact of fading on VANET

probability using graph-based Monte-Carlo simulations aiming for better
understanding of the connectivity in fading channels. The results show that
Rayleigh-fading channels reinforce the connectivity compared to no-fading

where $w(x)$ is a differentiable function, such that $\lim_{x\to \pm
\infty}w(x)=\mp k_0$, and $k_0$ is a nonzero real. We also find that when $k_0$
is a complex number, then the eigenvalue of the corresponding Shr\""odinger
operator has an exact solution which, depending on $k_0$, represents a coherent
perfect absorber (CPA), laser, a localized bound state, a quasi bound state in
the continuum (a quasi-BIC), or an exceptional point (the latter requiring
additional conditions). Thus, $k_0$ is a bifurcation parameter that describes
transformations among all those solutions. Additionally, in a more specific
case of a real-valued function $w(x)$ the resulting potential, although not
being $PT$ symmetric, can feature a self-dual spectral singularity associated
with the CPA-laser operation. In the space of the system parameters, the
transition through each self-dual spectral singularity corresponds to a
bifurcation of a pair of complex-conjugate propagation constants from the
continuum. The bifurcation of a first complex-conjugate pair corresponds to the
phase transition from purely real to complex spectrum.

systems that can be described in terms of multiple, interacting ``agents''.
However, because of their inherently discrete and often highly non-linear
nature, it is very difficult to reason about the relationship between the state
of the model, on the one hand, and our observations of the real world on the
other. In this paper we consider agents that have a discrete set of states
that, at any instant, act with a probability that may depend on the environment
or the state of other agents. Given this, we show how the mathematical
apparatus of quantum field theory can be used to reason probabilistically about
the state and dynamics the model, and describe an algorithm to update our
belief in the state of the model in the light of new, real-world observations.
Using a simple predator-prey model on a 2-dimensional spatial grid as an
example, we demonstrate the assimilation of incomplete, noisy observations and
show that this leads to an increase in the mutual information between the
actual state of the observed system and the posterior distribution given the
observations, when compared to a null model.

physics aside from elementary particle interactions, the number of naturally
independent quantities, and hence the minimum number of base quantities within
a unit system, is five. These can be, for example, mass, charge, length, time,
and angle. It also highlights the benefits of expressing the laws of physics
using equations that are invariant when the size of the chosen unit for any of
these base quantities is changed. Following the pioneering work in this area by
Buckingham, these are termed complete equations, in contrast with equations
that require a specific unit to be used. Using complete equations is shown to
remove much ambiguity and confusion, especially where angles are involved. As
an example, some quantities relating to atomic frequencies are clarified. Also,
the reduced Planck constant h-bar, as commonly used, is shown to represent two
distinct quantities, one an action (energy x time), and the other an angular
momentum (action divided by angle). There would be benefits in giving these two
quantities different symbols. Lastly, the freedom to choose how base units are
defined is shown to allow, in principle, measurements of changes over time to
dimensional fundamental constants like c.
