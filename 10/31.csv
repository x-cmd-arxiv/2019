additional third parties, which Alice and Bob both trust to be honest during
the protocol. However, once the protocol concludes, there is no guarantee over
the behaviour of these third parties. It is possible that they collaborate and

protocols which are impossible in two-party cryptography. We implement a
variant of bit commitment in this setting, which we call erasable bit
commitment. In this primitive, Alice has the choice of either opening or
erasing her commitment after the commit phase. The ability to ask for an
erasure allows Alice to ask the trusted parties to erase her commitment in case
the trust period is about to expire. This erasure prevents a future coalition
of the third parties and Bob from extracting any information about the
commitment. However, this ability also makes erasable bit commitment weaker
than the standard version of bit commitment. In addition to satisfying the
security requirements of bit commitment, our protocol also does not reveal any
information about the commitment to the third parties. Lastly, our protocol for

tolerate a small number of corrupt trusted parties as well as implementation

task for robots capable of 3-D perception. Despite the impressive performance
of deep learning-based approaches on object segmentation in 2-D images, deep
learning has not been applied nearly as successfully for 3-D point cloud
segmentation. Deep networks generally require large amounts of labeled training
data, which are readily available for 2-D images but are difficult to produce
for 3-D point clouds. In this letter, we present Label Diffusion Lidar
Segmentation (LDLS), a novel approach for 3-D point cloud segmentation, which
leverages 2-D segmentation of an RGB image from an aligned camera to avoid the
need for training on annotated 3-D data. We obtain 2-D segmentation predictions
by applying Mask-RCNN to the RGB image, and then link this image to a 3-D lidar
point cloud by building a graph of connections among 3-D points and 2-D pixels.
This graph then directs a semi-supervised label diffusion process, where the
2-D pixels act as source nodes that diffuse object label information through
the 3-D point cloud, resulting in a complete 3-D point cloud segmentation. We
conduct empirical studies on the KITTI benchmark dataset and on a mobile robot,
demonstrating wide applicability and superior performance of LDLS compared with
the previous state of the art in 3-D point cloud segmentation, without any need
for either 3-D training data or fine tuning of the 2-D image segmentation

pump-out (density reduction) by n = 2 resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) is
consistent with the effects of narrow well-separated magnetic islands at the
top and bottom of the H-mode pedestal in DIII-D low-collisionality plasmas.
Nonlinear two-fluid MHD simulations for DIII-D ITER Similar Shape (ISS)
discharges show that, at low collisionality, low pedestal density is required
for resonant field penetration at the pedestal top, consistent with the
ubiquitous low density requirement for ELM suppression in these DIII-D plasmas.
The simulations predict a drop in the pedestal pressure due to parallel
transport across these narrow width (0.02) magnetic islands at the top of the
pedestal that is stabilizing to Peeling-Ballooning-Modes (PBMs), and comparable
to the pedestal pressure reduction observed in experiment at the onset of ELM
suppression. The simulations predict density pump-out at experimentally
relevant levels (-20%) at low pedestal collisionality due to very narrow
(~0.01-0.02) RMP driven magnetic islands at the pedestal foot at ~0.99. The
simulations show decreasing pump-out with increasing density, consistent with
experiment, resulting from the inverse dependence of parallel particle
transport on resistivity at the foot of the pedestal. The robust screening of
resonant fields is predicted between the top and bottom of the pedestal during
density pump-out and ELM suppression, consistent with the preservation of
strong temperature gradients in the edge transport barrier as seen in
experiment.

the modification to di-Higgs production rate in different regions of the

and direct searches for BSM particles and precision Higgs couplings
measurements at the HL-LHC. We found that the di-Higgs production cross section
can be enhanced significantly through resonant production. In the region where
the resonant production cross section is small, di-Higgs receives a moderate
enhancement due to the modifications in the Higgs couplings. In addition, there
is a strong correlation between di-Higgs production and single Higgs

the outcomes of three classifiers, namely, a Logistic Regression model, a
Random Forest model, and a Support Vector Machine model. The output of the
combined model is selected on the basis of the majority of the output classes

complementary event that it remains private or goes bankrupt, in the considered

valuable figure for Private Equity investors, who typically expect very high

quality of spectropolarimetric inversions obtained from various wavelength
samplings during umbral flashes. We computed numerical simulations of nonlinear
wave propagation in a sunspot and constructed synthetic Stokes profiles in the
Ca II 8542 \AA\ line during an umbral flash using the NLTE code NICOLE. The
spectral resolution of the Stokes profiles was downgraded to various cases with
differences in the wavelength coverage. A large set of wavelength samplings was
analyzed and the performance of the inversions was evaluated by comparing the
inferred chromospheric temperature, velocity, and magnetic field with the
actual values at the chromosphere of the numerical simulation. The errors in
the inverted results depend to a large extent on the location of the wavelength
points across the profile of the line. The inferred magnetic field improves
with the increase of the spectral resolution. In the case of velocity and
temperature, low spectral resolution data produce a match of the inverted
atmospheres with the actual values comparable to wavelength samplings with
finer resolution, while providing a higher temporal cadence in the data
acquisition. We validated the NLTE inversions of spectropolarimetric data from
the Ca II 8542 \AA\ during umbral flashes, during which the atmosphere
undergoes sudden dramatic changes due to the propagation of a shock wave. Our
results favor the use of fine spectral resolution for analyses that focus on

particular in the high-mass regime, is a challenge in astrophysics. Chemical
clocks could help alleviating this problem, but their evolution strongly
depends on many parameters, leading to degeneracy in the interpretation of the
observational data. One of these uncertainties is the degree of CO depletion.
We present here the first self-consistent magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of
high-mass star-forming regions at different scales, fully coupled with a
non-equilibrium chemical network, which includes C-N-O bearing molecules.
Depletion and desorption processes are treated time-dependently. The results
show that full CO-depletion (i.e. all gas-phase CO frozen-out on the surface of
dust grains), can be reached very quickly, in one third or even smaller
fractions of the free-fall time, whether the collapse proceeds on slow or fast
timescales. This leads to a high level of deuteration in a short time both for
typical tracers like N$_2$H$^+$, as well as for the main ion H$_3^+$, the
latter being in general larger and more extended. N$_2$ depletion is slightly
less efficient, and no direct effects on N-bearing molecules and deuterium
fractionation are observed. We show that CO depletion is not the only driver of
deuteration, and that there is a strong impact on $D_{frac}$ when changing the
grain-size. We finally apply a two-dimensional gaussian Point Spread Function
to our results to mimic observations with single-dish and interferometers. Our
findings suggest that the low-values observed in high-mass star-forming clumps
are in reality masking a full-depletion stage in the inner 0.1 pc region.

of cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature at large angular separation,
based on published maps derived from {\sl WMAP} and {\sl Planck} satellite
data, using different models of astrophysical foregrounds. It is found that
using a common analysis, the results from the two satellites are very similar.
In particular, it is found that previously published differences between
measured values of $C(\Theta)$ near $\Theta=90^\circ$ arise mainly from
different choices of masks in regions of largest Galactic emissions, and that
demonstrated measurement biases are reduced by eliminating masks altogether.
Maps from both satellites are shown to agree with $C(90^\circ)=0$ to within
estimated statistical and systematic errors, consistent with an exact symmetry
predicted in a new holographic quantum model of inflation.

Generally, there are three degrees of freedom propagating in the theory, of
which two are tensorial and one is of the scalar type. Through a detailed
Hamiltonian analysis, we find two necessary and sufficient conditions to evade
the scalar type degree of freedom. The first condition implies that the
lapse-extrinsic curvature sector must be degenerate. The second condition
ensures that the dimension of the phase space at each spacetime point is even,
so that the scalar type degree of freedom is eliminated completely. We also
compare our results with the previous studies, and apply our formalism to a
simple example, in which the Lagrangian is quadratic in the extrinsic
curvature.

Monte Carlo (RMC) modeling bypasses the melt-quenching route - but RMC often

small velocity difference of 300 km/s between the two components. This small
radial velocity difference suggests that most of the relative velocity takes
place in the plane of the sky, and implies that SPT-CL J0356-5337 is a major
merger with a small impact parameter seen face-on. We also assess the relative
contributions of galaxy-scale halos to the overall mass of the core of the
cluster and find that within 800 kpc from the brightest cluster galaxy about
27% of the total mass can be attributed to visible and dark matter associated
with galaxies, whereas only 73% of the total mass in the core comes from
cluster-scale dark matter halos.

voters. Candidates can have different weights. A committee is a subset of
candidates, and its weight is the sum of weights of its candidates. Each voter
expresses an ordinal ranking over all possible committees. The only assumption
we make on preferences is monotonicity: If $S \subseteq S'$ are two committees,
then any voter weakly prefers $S'$ to $S$. We study a general notion of group
fairness via stability: A committee of given total weight $K$ is stable if no
coalition of voters can deviate and choose a committee of proportional weight,
so that all these voters strictly prefer the new committee to the existing one.
Extending this notion to approximation, for parameter $c \ge 1$, a committee
$S$ of weight $K$ is said to be $c$-approximately stable if for any other
committee $S'$ of weight $K'$, the fraction of voters that strictly prefer $S'$
to $S$ is strictly less than $\frac{c K'}{K}$. When $c = 1$, this condition is
equivalent to classical core stability. The question we ask is: Does a
$c$-approximately stable committee of weight at most any given value $K$ always
exist for constant $c$? It is relatively easy to show that there exist monotone
preferences for which $c \ge 2$. However, even for simple and widely studied
preference structures, a non-trivial upper bound on $c$ has been elusive. In
this paper, we show that $c = O(1)$ for all monotone preference structures. Our
proof proceeds via showing an existence result for a randomized notion of
stability, and iteratively rounding the resulting fractional solution.

transformations. Applying combinations of such transformations on faulty code
yields fix candidates whose correctness must be determined. Exploring these
combinations leads to an explosion on the number of generated fix candidates
that severely limits the applicability of such fault repair techniques. This
explosion is most times tamed by not considering fix candidates exhaustively,
and by disabling intra-statement modifications. In this article we present a
technique for program repair that considers an ample set of intra-statement
syntactic operations, and explores fix candidates exhaustively up to a provided
bound. The suitability of the technique, implemented in our tool Stryker, is
supported by a novel mechanism to detect and prune infeasible fix candidates.
This allows Stryker to repair programs with several bugs, whose fixes require
multiple modifications. We evaluate our technique on a benchmark of faulty Java
container classes, which Stryker is able to repair, pruning significant parts
of the space of generated candidates when more than one bug is present in the

recognize inputs from outside the training set as unknowns. This problem has
been studied under multiple paradigms including out-of-distribution detection
and open set recognition. For convolutional neural networks, there have been
two major approaches: 1) inference methods to separate knowns from unknowns and
2) feature space regularization strategies to improve model robustness to
outlier inputs. There has been little effort to explore the relationship
between the two approaches and directly compare performance on anything other
than small-scale datasets that have at most 100 categories. Using ImageNet-1K
and Places-434, we identify novel combinations of regularization and
specialized inference methods that perform best across multiple outlier
detection problems of increasing difficulty level. We found that input
perturbation and temperature scaling yield the best performance on large scale
datasets regardless of the feature space regularization strategy. Improving the
feature space by regularizing against a background class can be helpful if an
appropriate background class can be found, but this is impractical for large
scale image classification datasets.

thus robust, unless new physics enters on even longer wavelengths. The fate of
the instability and the subsequent time-evolution of the system depend on the

host nodal fermions that are enforced by band folding and electron count, that

retrievals routinely performed for low-resolution spectra (LRS) by developing a
mapping from the cross correlation function to a likelihood metric. We build
upon previous studies and report HyDRA-H, a hybrid retrieval code for
simultaneous analysis of low- and high- resolution thermal emission spectra of
exoplanets in a fully Bayesian approach. We demonstrate HyDRA-H on the hot

Spitzer photometry (IRAC 3.6-8 $\mu$m) bands, while the HRS data were obtained
with CRIRES on VLT at 2.3 $\mu$m. The constraints on the composition and
temperature profiles for the hybrid retrieval are more stringent than
retrievals with either LRS or HRS datasets individually. We retrieve abundances
of $\log(\mathrm{H_2O)} = -4.11^{+0.91}_{-0.30}$ and $\log(\mathrm{CO}) =
{-2.16}^{+0.99}_{-0.47}$, and $\mathrm{C/O} = 0.99^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$, consistent

afterglow emission from radio up to X-ray frequencies is thought to originate
from synchrotron radiation emitted by relativistic, non-thermal electrons
accelerated by the blast wave, the origin of the emission at high energies (HE;
$\gtrsim$~GeV) remains uncertain. The recent detection of sub-TeV emission from

as a candidate for the HE and VHE emissions, considering two sources of seed
photons for scattering: synchrotron photons from the blast wave (synchrotron
self-Compton or SSC) and isotropic photon fields external to the blast wave
(external Compton). For each case, we compute the multi-wavelength afterglow

the GeV emission, unless a dense ambient infrared photon field, typical of

background light attenuation, we discuss the detectability of VHE afterglows by
existing and future gamma-ray instruments for a wide range of model parameters.
Studying GRB~190114C, we find that its afterglow emission in the \fermi-LAT
band is synchrotron-dominated.The late-time \fermi-LAT measurement (i.e.,
$t\sim 10^4$~s), and the MAGIC observation also set an upper limit on the
energy density of a putative external infrared photon field (i.e. $\lesssim

the sub-TeV energies.

strongly-magnetised massive stars. These stars are promising progenitors of
those neutron stars that host the strongest magnetic fields in the Universe,

techniques will be required. In this work, we derive, implement, and evaluate
an efficient method to simultaneously sample the result of applying any
constant pulling force within a specified range to a molecular system of
interest. We start from Simulated Tempering in Force, whereby force is applied
as a linear bias on a collective variable to the system's Hamiltonian, and the
coefficient is taken as a continuous auxiliary degree of freedom. We derive a
formula for an average collective-variable-dependent force, which depends on a
set of weights, learned on-the-fly throughout a simulation, that reflect the
limit where force varies infinitely quickly. These weights can then be used to
retroactively compute averages of any observable at any force within the
specified range. This technique is based on recent work deriving similar
equations for Infinite Switch Simulated Tempering in Temperature, that showed
the infinite switch limit is the most efficient for sampling. Here, we
demonstrate that our method accurately and simultaneously samples molecular
systems at all forces within a user defined force range, and show how it can
serve as an enhanced sampling tool for cases where the pulling direction
destabilizes states of low free-energy at zero-force. This method is

difficulty in training such larger-context (i.e. document-level) machine

To circumvent this issue, two-stage approaches, in which sentence-level

particular, we consider three distinct approaches to generate the missing
context: using random contexts, applying a copy heuristic or generating it with
a language model. In particular, the copy heuristic significantly helps with
lexical coherence, while using completely random contexts hurts performance on
many long-distance linguistic phenomena. We also validate the usefulness of

analysis of such systems that uses a sequential optimization framework.
Building upon that, in this paper, we extend our results by providing another
angle on multiagent network dynamics from a duality perspective, which allows
us to view the network structure as dual variables of a constrained nonlinear
program. Leveraging that idea, we show that the evolution of the coupled
state-network multiagent dynamics can be viewed as iterates of a primal-dual
algorithm for a static constrained optimization/saddle-point problem. This view
bridges the Lyapunov stability of state-dependent network dynamics and
frequently used optimization techniques such as block coordinated descent,
mirror descent, the Newton method, and the subgradient method. As a result, we
develop a systematic framework for analyzing the Lyapunov stability of
state-dependent network dynamics using techniques from nonlinear optimization.

pressure is incident, has a large (width $\sim$1 kpc, height $\sim$1 kpc above
the disk midplane) extraplanar plume of molecular gas and dust. Molecular gas
in the plume region shows distinct non-circular motions in the direction of the
ram pressure; the kinematic offset of up to 60 km s$^{-1}$ is consistent with
acceleration by ram pressure. We also detect a small amount of gas in clouds
below the plume that are spatially and kinematically distinct from the
surrounding medium, and appear to be decoupled from the stripped ISM. We
propose that diffuse molecular gas is directly stripped but GMC density gas is
not directly stripped, and so decouples from lower density stripped gas.
However, GMCs become effectively stripped on short timescales. We also find
morphological and kinematic signatures of ram pressure compression of molecular
gas in a region of intense star formation on the leading side at $r \sim 3.5$
kpc. We propose that the compressed and stripped zones represent different
evolutionary stages of the ram pressure interaction, and that feedback from
star formation in the compressed zone facilitates the effective stripping of
GMCs by making the gas cycle rapidly to a lower density diffuse state.

Harmonic mappings are defined between Riemannian manifolds as critical points

more general setting (manifolds with affine connections). Using the
well-established formalism of calculus of variations on fibred manifolds we
solve the weak inverse problem for the equation of geodesic mappings and get a
variational equation which is a consequence of the geodesic mappings equation.
For the connection on the target manifold we get the expected result, that it
is a metric connection. However, we find that the connection on the source
manifold need not be metric. The interesting result is that the metric which
induces the connection on the target manifold can change between fibres and
these changes are related to the connection on the source manifold. These

$R$-parity odd particle can reside in the hidden sector and act as dark matter.
We consider the case when the hidden sector has ultraweak interactions with the
visible sector. An interesting phenomenon arises if the LSP of the visible
sector is charged in which case it will decay to the hidden sector dark matter.
Due to the ultraweak interactions, the LSP of the visible sector will be
long-lived decaying outside the detector after leaving a track inside. We
investigate this possibility in the framework of a $U(1)_X$-extended MSSM/SUGRA
model with a small gauge kinetic mixing and mass mixing between the $U(1)_X$
and $U(1)_Y$ where $U(1)_Y$ is the gauge group of the hypercharge. Specifically
we investigate the case when the LSP of MSSM is a stop which decays into the
hidden sector dark matter and has a lifetime long enough to traverse the LHC
detector without decay. It is shown that such a particle can be detected at the
HL-LHC and HE-LHC as an $R$-hadron which will look like a slow moving muon with
a large transverse momentum $p_T$ and so can be detected by the track it leaves
in the inner tracker and in the muon spectrometer. Further, due to the
ultraweak couplings between the hidden sector and the MSSM fields, the dark
matter particle has a relic density arising from a combination of the
freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms. It is found that even for the ultraweak or
feeble interactions the freeze-out contribution relative to freeze-in
contribution to the relic density is substantial to dominant, varying between
30\% to 74\% for the model points considered. It is subdominant to freeze-in
for relatively small stop masses with relatively larger stop annihilation
cross-sections and the dominant contribution to the relic density for
relatively large stop masses and relatively smaller stop annihilation
cross-sections.

quite standard to ask for exact geometric information to implement a priori or
a posteriori error analysis of numerical solutions, which, however, is often
violated in practice. Such gap is filled using the superconvergence of
differential structure on manifolds. We illustrate the idea using two concrete
exemplary case study. In the first case, we deal with deviated manifolds, where
we propose a concept called geometric supercloseness. It is shown that this
condition is capable of proving the superconvergence of gradient recovery on
deviated discretized manifolds. This closes the open questions proposed by Wei,
Chen, and Huang in SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 48(2010), pp. 1920--1943. For this
matter, an algorithmic framework for gradient recovery without asking exact
geometric information are proposed. A second example shows that the
superconvergence of differential structure enables us to develop optimal
convergent numerical method for solving vector Laplacians on discretized
manifold without superparametric element or exact normal fields, which are
required by approaches from literature. Numerical results are documented for
verifying the theoretical discoveries.

layer outputs of the CNN and by using powers-of-two weights, which replaces the
computationally expensive multiplication operations with bit-shift operations.
Denoising operation during inference forces small valued intermediate layer
outputs to zero. The number of zeros in the network significantly increases as
a result of denoising, we can implement the CNN about 10% faster than a
comparable network while detecting all the anomalies in the testing set. It
turns out that denoising operation also provides robustness because the
contribution of small intermediate values to the final result is negligible.
During training we also generate motion vector images by a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) to improve the robustness of the overall system. We
experimentally observe that the resulting system is robust to background

features, relying on geometric and visual information only, whereas more modern
approaches tend to use semantic, appearance or geometric features extracted
from deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While these approaches are
successful in many applications, they do not utilize all of the information
that a monocular image provides, and many of them, particularly the
deep-learning based methods, require user-chosen thresholding to actually close
loops -- which may impact generality in practical applications. In this work,
we address these issues by extracting all three modes of information from a
custom deep CNN trained specifically for the task of place recognition. Our
network is built upon a combination of a semantic segmentator, Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) and triplet embedding network. The network is trained to
construct a global feature space to describe both the visual appearance and
semantic layout of an image. Then local keypoints are extracted from
maximally-activated regions of low-level convolutional feature maps, and
keypoint descriptors are extracted from these feature maps in a novel way that
incorporates ideas from successful hand-crafted features. These keypoints are
matched globally for loop closure candidates, and then used as a final
geometric check to refute false positives. As a result, the proposed loop
closure detection system requires no touchy thresholding, and is highly robust
to false positives -- achieving better precision-recall curves than the
state-of-the-art NetVLAD, and with real-time speeds.

utilize the existing min approach [2] [9] as a defense strategy to optimize
intrusion detection systems that minimize the loss of the incorporated
adversarial samples during the adversarial training. We study and measure the
effectiveness of the adversarial attack methods as well as the resistance of
the adversarially trained models against such attacks. We find that the
adversarial attack methods that were designed in binary domains can be used in
continuous domains and exhibit different misclassification levels. We finally
show that principal component analysis (PCA) based feature reduction can boost

  impact of systematics in effective temperature or metallicity","Accepted for publication as AAS Research Note",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An increasingly popular method to determine stellar ages of red-giant stars
for the purpose of Galactic archaeology is asteroseismic grid-based modelling
(GBM). In asteroseismic GBM of red-giant stars with solar-like oscillations the
large frequency separation ($\Delta\nu$) and the frequency of maximum
oscillation power ($\nu_{\rm max}$) are commonly used asteroseismic
observables, in addition to the usual spectroscopic parameters effective
temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$) and metallicity ([Fe/H]). The precision with which
$\Delta\nu$ and $\nu_{\rm max}$ can be determined largely depends on the length
of the timeseries data (assuming the stars are bright enough that the
oscillations can be detected). The question that we aim to answer here is: with
what precision should [Fe/H] and $T_{\rm eff}$ be obtained to derive stellar
ages of red-giant stars through asteroseismic GBM given the precision of
$\Delta\nu$ and $\nu_{\rm max}$ that we can expect from the TESS data? In most
cases presented here the value of $\sigma_{\rm age}$ shows only weak, or no,
dependence on the uncertainties and biases in [Fe/H] and $T_{\rm eff}$ ingested
in this study. Only in case a large ($>100$~K) $T_{\rm eff}$ biases is
accompanied by a small (50 K) uncertainties in $T_{\rm eff}$ on the red-giant
branch, $\Delta_{\rm age}$ is of the order of or larger than $\sigma_{\rm age}$
and in these cases we expect an impact of this bias on the resulting age
estimate.

has to provide those commands continuously in order manipulate the effector of
the robot step-by-step, which results in a tiresome process for simple tasks
such as pick and replace an item from a surface. Here, we take a
semi-autonomous approach based on a conformal geometric algebra model that
solves the inverse kinematics of the robot on the fly, then the user only has
to decide on the start of the movement and the final position of the effector
(goal-selection approach). Under these conditions, we implemented
pick-and-place tasks with a disk as an item and two target areas placed on the
table at arbitrary positions. An artificial vision (AV) algorithm was used to
obtain the positions of the items expressed in the robot frame through images

from the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theory. In this article, we address an
important issue that arises in the presence of model error. In particular, when
the equilibrium density function is high dimensional and non-Gaussian, and in
some cases, is unknown, the linear response statistics are inaccessible. We
show that this issue can be resolved by fitting the imperfect model to
appropriate marginal linear response statistics that can be approximated using
the available data and parametric or nonparametric models. The effectiveness of
the parameter estimation approach is demonstrated in the context of molecular
dynamical models (Langevin dynamics) with a non-uniform temperature profile,
where the modeling error is due to coarse-graining, and a PDE (non-Langevin
dynamics) that exhibits spatiotemporal chaos, where the model error arises from
a severe spectral truncation. In these examples, we show how the imperfect
models, the Langevin equation with parameters estimated using the proposed
scheme, can predict the nonlinear response statistics of the underlying
dynamics under admissible external disturbances.

Contrary to intuition,
the population of opposite chiralities is surprisingly asymmetric at
fundamental levels. Examples range from parity violation in the subatomic weak
force to the homochirality in essential biomolecules. The ability to achieve
chirality-selective synthesis (chiral induction) is of great importance in
stereochemistry, molecular biology and pharmacology. In condensed matter
physics, a crystalline electronic system is geometrically chiral when it lacks
any mirror plane, space inversion center or roto-inversion axis. Typically, the
geometrical chirality is predefined by a material's chiral lattice structure,
which is fixed upon the formation of the crystal. By contrast, a particularly
unconventional scenario is the gyrotropic order, where chirality spontaneously
emerges across a phase transition as the electron system breaks the relevant
symmetries of an originally achiral lattice. Such a gyrotropic order, proposed
as the quantum analogue of the cholesteric liquid crystals, has attracted
significant interest. However, to date, a clear observation and manipulation of
the gyrotropic order remain challenging. We report the realization of optical
chiral induction and the observation of a gyrotropically ordered phase in the
transition-metal dichalcogenide semimetal $1T$-TiSe$_2$. We show that shining
mid-infrared circularly polarized light near the critical temperature leads to
the preferential formation of one chiral domain. As a result, we are able to
observe an out-of-plane circular photogalvanic current, whose direction depends
on the optical induction. Our study provides compelling evidence for the
spontaneous emergence of chirality in the correlated semimetal TiSe$_2$. Such
chiral induction provides a new way of optical control over novel orders in

parametrization of the luminosity-distance relation at $z>0.15$: no model is

measurements of the Hubble constant and deceleration parameter. Furthermore, it
can directly assess the impact of BAO observations on the strong 4--5$\sigma$

health syndromes to heal any failure occurrence inside the functions layer.

causal conclusion would change were U measured and included in the primary
analysis. Works along this line often make various parametric assumptions on U,
for the sake of mathematical and computational simplicity. In this article, we
further this line of research by developing a valid sensitivity analysis that
leaves the distribution of U unrestricted. Our semiparametric estimator has
three desirable features compared to many existing methods in the literature.
First, our method allows for a larger and more flexible family of models, and
mitigates observable implications (Franks et al., 2019). Second, our methods
work seamlessly with any primary analysis that models the outcome regression
parametrically. Third, our method is easy to use and interpret. We construct
both pointwise confidence intervals and confidence bands that are uniformly
valid over a given sensitivity parameter space, thus formally accounting for
unknown sensitivity parameters. We apply our proposed method on an influential
yet controversial study of the causal relationship between war experiences and
political activeness using observational data from Uganda.

infer the temperature $T$, line-of-sight velocity $v_{\rm los}$, and magnetic
field $\rm{\bf B}$ as a function of the continuum optical-depth $\tau_{\rm c}$.
However, they do not directly provide the gas pressure $P_{\rm g}$ or density
$\rho$. In order to obtain these latter parameters, inversion codes rely
instead on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) in addition to the
equation of state (EOS). Unfortunately, the assumption of HE is rather
unrealistic across magnetic field lines. This is because the role of the
Lorentz force, among other factors, is neglected. This translates into an
inaccurate conversion from optical depth $\tau_{\rm c}$ to geometrical height
$z$. We aim at improving this conversion via the application of
magneto-hydrostatic (MHS) equilibrium instead of HE. We develop a method to
solve the momentum equation under MHS equilibrium (i.e., taking the Lorentz
force into account) in three dimensions. The method is based on the solution of
a Poisson-like equation. Considering the gas pressure $P_{\rm g}$ and density
$\rho$ from three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of
sunspots as a benchmark, we compare the results from the application of HE and
MHS equilibrium. We find that HE retrieves the gas pressure and density within
an order of magnitude of the MHD values in only about 47 \% of the domain. This
translates into an error of about $160-200$ km in the determination of the
$z-\tau_{\rm c}$ conversion. On the other hand, the application of MHS
equilibrium allows determination of $P_{\rm g}$ and $\rho$ within an order of
magnitude in 84 \% of the domain. In this latter case, the $z-\tau_{\rm c}$
conversion is obtained with an accuracy of $30-70$ km.

exploratory data analysis. Yet, the basic approach to clustering has not really
changed: a practitioner hand-picks a task-specific clustering loss to optimize
and fit the given data to reveal the underlying cluster structure. Some types
of losses---such as k-means, or its non-linear version: kernelized k-means
(centroid based), and DBSCAN (density based)---are popular choices due to their
good empirical performance on a range of applications. Although every so often
the clustering output using these standard losses fails to reveal the
underlying structure, and the practitioner has to custom-design their own
variation. In this work we take an intrinsically different approach to
clustering: rather than fitting a dataset to a specific clustering loss, we
train a recurrent model that learns how to cluster. The model uses as training
pairs examples of datasets (as input) and its corresponding cluster identities
(as output). By providing multiple types of training datasets as inputs, our
model has the ability to generalize well on unseen datasets (new clustering
tasks). Our experiments reveal that by training on simple synthetically
generated datasets or on existing real datasets, we can achieve better
clustering performance on unseen real-world datasets when compared with
standard benchmark clustering techniques. Our meta clustering model works well
even for small datasets where the usual deep learning models tend to perform
worse.

in a figure of merit associated with a perturbation to the shape of the object.
The shape gradient can be used for gradient-based optimization, sensitivity
analysis, and tolerance calculations. However, it is generally expensive to
compute from finite-difference derivatives for shapes which are described by
many parameters, as is the case for stellarator geometry. In an accompanying
work (Antonsen et al. 2019), generalized self-adjointness relations are
obtained for MHD equilibria. These describe the relation between perturbed
equilibria due to changes in the rotational transform or toroidal current
profiles, displacements of the plasma boundary, modifications of currents in
the vacuum region, or the addition of bulk forces. These are applied to
efficiently compute the shape gradient of functions of magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) equilibria with an adjoint approach. In this way, the shape derivative
with respect to any perturbation applied to the plasma boundary or coil shapes
can be computed with only one additional MHD equilibrium solution. We
demonstrate that this approach is applicable for several figures of merit of
interest for stellarator configuration optimization: the magnetic well, the
magnetic ripple on axis, the departure from quasisymmetry, the effective ripple
in the low-collisionality $1/\nu$ regime ($\epsilon_{\text{eff}}^{3/2})$ (Nemov
et al. 1999), and several finite collisionality neoclassical quantities.
Numerical verification is demonstrated for the magnetic well figure of merit
with the VMEC code (Hirshman & Whitson 1983) and for the magnetic ripple with
modification of the ANIMEC code (Cooper et al. 1992). Comparisons with the
direct approach demonstrate that to obtain agreement within several percent,
the adjoint approach provides a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ in computational

broad width (i.e. $\Delta v \sim 10,000$ km~s$^{-1}$) , a feature often
required for X-ray spectral modeling. While unclear to date, this condition is
occasionally interpreted and justified as internal turbulence within the UFOs
for simplicity. In this work, we exploit a transverse motion of a
three-dimensional accretion-disk wind, an essential feature of non-radial
outflow morphology unique to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) outflows. We argue that
at least part of the observed line width of UFOs may reflect the degree of
transverse velocity gradient due to Doppler broadening around a putative
compact X-ray corona in the proximity of a black hole. In this scenario, line
broadening is sensitive to the geometrical size of the corona, $R_c$. We
calculate the broadening factor as a function of coronal radius $R_c$ and
velocity smearing factor $f_{\rm sm}$ at a given plasma position. We
demonstrate, as a case study of the quasar, PDS~456, that the spectral analysis
favors a compact coronal size of $R_c /R_g \lesssim 10$ where $R_g$ is
gravitational radius. Such a compact corona is long speculated from both X-ray
reverberation study and the lamppost model for disk emission also consistent
with microlensing results. Combination of such a transverse broadening around a
small corona can be a direct probe of a substantial rotational motion perhaps

approximation algorithms to solve the sub-problems and another, named the
AA-BUD algorithm, to solve the BUD problem with guaranteed performance. The
performance of the AA-BUD algorithm has been demonstrated via extensive

estimate a global feature of the network, such as a weighted average of locally

entanglement shared by the nodes can improve the precision of parameter
estimation relative to the precision attainable by a network without shared
entanglement; for an entangled protocol, the root-mean-square estimation error
scales like $1/M$ with the number $M$ of sensing nodes, the so-called
Heisenberg scaling, while for protocols without entanglement, the error scales
like $1/\sqrt{M}$. However, in the presence of loss and other noise sources,
although multipartite entanglement still has some advantages for sensing
displacements and phases, the scaling of the precision with $M$ is less
favorable. In this paper, we show that using continuous-variable error
correction codes can enhance the robustness of sensing protocols against

Furthermore, while previous distributed sensing protocols could measure only a

""embedding debiasing"" methods fail to remove the effect, we demonstrate that a
careful application of methods that neutralize grammatical gender signals from

Fixing the grammatical gender bias yields a positive effect on the quality of

for large-scale problems. SGD estimates the gradient by uniform sampling with
sample size one. There have been several other works that suggest faster
epoch-wise convergence by using weighted non-uniform sampling for better
gradient estimates. Unfortunately, the per-iteration cost of maintaining this
adaptive distribution for gradient estimation is more than calculating the full
gradient itself, which we call the chicken-and-the-egg loop. As a result, the
false impression of faster convergence in iterations, in reality, leads to
slower convergence in time. In this paper, we break this barrier by providing
the first demonstration of a scheme, Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) sampled
Stochastic Gradient Descent (LGD), which leads to superior gradient estimation
while keeping the sampling cost per iteration similar to that of the uniform
sampling. Such an algorithm is possible due to the sampling view of LSH, which
came to light recently. As a consequence of superior and fast estimation, we
reduce the running time of all existing gradient descent algorithms, that
relies on gradient estimates including Adam, Ada-grad, etc. We demonstrate the

latent structure, such as the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathcal{G}(n, p)$? We
address this question for two of the most well-studied models of random graphs

  Our results are as follows: (1) we prove that the random intersection graph
converges in total variation to $\mathcal{G}(n, p)$ when $d =

security has been widely studied. Recently (2017) it was shown that existing
secure logging protocols are vulnerable to crash attack in which the adversary
modifies the log file and then crashes the system to make it indistinguishable
from a normal system crash. The attacker was assumed to be non-adaptive and not
be able to see the file content before modifying and crashing it (which will be
immediately after modifying the file). The authors also proposed a system
called SLiC that protects against this attacker. In this paper, we consider an
(insider) adaptive adversary who can see the file content as new log operations
are performed. This is a powerful adversary who can attempt to rewind the
system to a past state. We formalize security against this adversary and
introduce a scheme with provable security. We show that security against this
attacker requires some (small) protected memory that can become accessible to
the attacker after the system compromise. We show that existing secure logging
schemes are insecure in this setting, even if the system provides some
protected memory as above. We propose a novel mechanism that, in its basic
form, uses a pair of keys that evolve at different rates, and employ this
mechanism in an existing logging scheme that has forward integrity to obtain a
system with provable security against adaptive (and hence non-adaptive) crash
attack. We implemented our scheme on a desktop computer and a Raspberry Pi, and
showed in addition to higher security, a significant efficiency gain over SLiC.

the CMB from foreground contaminants. In this paper we present a novel
implementation of Bayesian CMB component separation. We sample from the full
posterior distribution using the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), a gradient based
sampling algorithm. Alongside this, we introduce new foreground modelling
approaches. We use the mean-shift algorithm to define regions on the sky,
clustering according to naively estimated foreground spectral parameters. Over
these regions we adopt a complete pooling model, where we assume constant
spectral parameters, and a hierarchical model, where we model individual
spectral parameters as being drawn from underlying hyper-distributions. We
validate the algorithm against simulations of the LiteBIRD and C-BASS
experiments, with an input tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r=5\times 10^{-3}$.
Considering multipoles $32\leq\ell\leq 121$, we are able to recover estimates
for $r$. With LiteBIRD only observations, and using the complete pooling model,
we recover $r=(10\pm 0.6)\times 10^{-3}$. For C-BASS and LiteBIRD observations
we find $r=(7.0\pm 0.6)\times 10^{-3}$ using the complete pooling model, and
$r=(5.0\pm 0.4)\times 10^{-3}$ using the hierarchical model. By adopting the
hierarchical model we are able to eliminate biases in our cosmological
parameter estimation, and obtain lower uncertainties due to the smaller
Galactic emission mask that can be adopted for power spectrum estimation.
Measured by the rate of effective sample generation, NUTS offers performance
improvements of $\sim10^3$ over using Metropolis-Hastings to fit the complete
pooling model. The efficiency of NUTS allows us to fit the more sophisticated
hierarchical foreground model, that would likely be intractable with
non-gradient based sampling algorithms.

In the limit of time-scale separation where the second particle with a fast

to coincide with each other. In the bipartite approach, the slow part does not,

properties of energy bands of a system. Their transitions under preserved
symmetries occur through closing a gap of energy bands, leading to
topologically protected edge states in energy spectra in topological phases.
Here we predict a new topological phase that emerges through closing a gap of
bands constructed by energy bands, instead of through closing an energy gap
with preserved symmetries. From this perspective, topological phases may arise
from topological properties of the ""bands of bands"" associated with their gap
closure and corresponding edge states. We demonstrate this idea by studying a
tight-binding model. We find that the Wannier bands constructed by energy bands
exhibit a gap closure associated with a change of a winding number, while the
energy bands remain gapped and trivial without any zero energy modes. In
addition, the topological Wannier bands give rise to quantized edge
polarizations. Since the emergence of this topological phase does not involve
any energy gap closure, we expect its appearance under unitary time evolution.
Indeed, this phase appears as we perform a quench dynamics. Our study opens a
new direction for exploring topological phases beyond conventional energy band
characterization.

to estimate and forecast physiology related to the human glucose-insulin
system, constrained by available data. By constructing a simple yet flexible
model class with interpretable parameters, this general model can be
specialized to work in different settings, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) and intensive care unit (ICU); different choices of appropriate model
functions describing uptake of nutrition and removal of glucose differentiate
between the models. In both cases, the available data is sparse and collected
in clinical settings, major factors that have constrained our model choice to
the simple form adopted.
  The model has the form of a linear stochastic differential equation (SDE) to
describe the evolution of the BG level. The model includes a term quantifying
glucose removal from the bloodstream through the regulation system of the human
body and two other terms representing the effect of nutrition and externally
delivered insulin. The stochastic fluctuations encapsulate model error
necessitated by the simple model form and enable flexible incorporation of
data. The model parameters must be learned in a patient-specific fashion,
leading to personalized models. We present experimental results on
patient-specific parameter estimation and future BG level forecasting in T2DM

as an expected value accompanied by a band around this value which accounts for
uncertainties in the prediction. Such predictions, then, have the potential for
use as part of control systems that are robust to model imperfections and noisy
data. Finally, the model's predictive capability is compared with two different
models built explicitly for T2DM and ICU contexts.

apply this model in a materials science setting to study the relationship

Greater knowledge of this relationship can lead to engineering materials with

energy efficient. To this end, topology control is an important mechanism to
realize self-organized WSNs that are capable of adapting to the dynamics of the
environment. Topology optimization is combinatorial in nature, and generally is
NP-hard to solve. Most existing algorithms leverage heuristic rules to reduce
the number of search candidates so as to obtain a suboptimal solution in a

topology optimization algorithm, a unified search framework, for self-organized
energy-efficient WSNs. Specifically, the proposed algorithm uses a deep neural
network to guide a Monte Carlo tree search to roll out simulations, and the
results from the tree search reinforce the learning of the neural network. In
addition, the proposed algorithm is an anytime algorithm that keeps improving
the solution with an increasing amount of computing resources. Various
simulations show that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance as
compared to heuristic solutions, and is capable of adapting to environment and
network changes without restarting the algorithm from scratch.

specificity when compared to gradient-echo fMRI. However, high spatiotemporal
resolution SE-fMRI with large slice-coverage is challenging as SE-fMRI requires
a long echo time (TE) to generate blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)
contrast, leading to long repetition times (TR). The aim of this work is to
develop an acquisition method that enhances the slice-coverage of SE-fMRI at
high spatiotemporal resolution. An acquisition scheme was developed entitled
Multisection Excitation by Simultaneous Spin-echo Interleaving (MESSI) with
complex-encoded generalized SLIce Dithered Enhanced Resolution (cgSlider).
MESSI utilizes the dead-time during the long TE by interleaving the excitation
and readout of two slices to enable 2x slice-acceleration, while cgSlider
utilizes the stable temporal background phase in SE-fMRI to encode and decode
two adjacent slices simultaneously with a phase-constrained reconstruction
method. The proposed cgSlider-MESSI was also combined with Simultaneous
Multi-Slice (SMS) to achieve further slice-acceleration. This combined approach
was used to achieve 1.5mm isotropic whole-brain SE-fMRI with a temporal
resolution of 1.5s and was evaluated using sensory stimulation and breath-hold
tasks at 3T. Compared to conventional SE-SMS, cgSlider-MESSI-SMS provides
four-fold increase in slice-coverage for the same TR, with comparable temporal
signal-to-noise ratio. Corresponding fMRI activation from cgSlider-MESSI-SMS
for both fMRI tasks were consistent with those from conventional SE-SMS.
Overall, cgSlider-MESSI-SMS achieved a 32x encoding-acceleration by combining
RinplanexMBxcgSliderxMESSI=4x2x2x2. High-quality, high-resolution whole-brain
SE-fMRI was acquired at a short TR using cgSlider-MESSI-SMS.

the two random variables and the product of their marginals. We use sparsity
inducing gradient penalties to promote input sparsity of the critic of the IPM.
In the kernel version we show that SIC can be cast as a convex optimization

feature selection as they are normalized feature importance scores. We then
present a neural version of SIC where the critic is parameterized as a
homogeneous neural network, improving its representation power as well as its
interpretability. We conduct experiments validating SIC for feature selection

flows for learning energy-based models (EBMs). From a perspective of physical
simulation, we redefine the problem of approximating the gradient flow
utilizing optimal transport (i.e. Wasserstein) metric. In EBMs, the learning
process of stepwise sampling and estimating data distribution performs the
functional gradient of minimizing the global relative entropy between the
current and target real distribution, which can be treated as dynamic particles
moving from disorder to target manifold. Previous learning schemes mainly
minimize the entropy concerning the consecutive time KL divergence in each
learning step. However, they are prone to being stuck in the local KL
divergence by projecting non-smooth information within smooth manifold, which
is against the optimal transport principle. To solve this problem, we derive a
second-order Wasserstein gradient flow of the global relative entropy from
Fokker-Planck equation. Compared with existing schemes, Wasserstein gradient
flow is a smoother and near-optimal numerical scheme to approximate real data
densities. We also derive this near-proximal scheme and provide its numerical

superiority and potentials of our proposed scheme on fitting complex

capture is captured better by an explicit modelling of the control flow in

causality notions in the security domain, we bring forward a definition of

provides a clear picture of the interaction between control flow and causality

concepts. We give convincing results on a benchmark of 34 examples from the

generalized 3-dimensional non-abelian Stokes' theorem related to parallel
transport on surfaces. It can be naturally extended to four dimension when the
underlying crossed module is replaced by crossed 2-module. This 4-dimensional
Stokes' theorem yields a global formula for volume holonomy, and also
guarantees its gauge invariance. In the process, we also find composition
formulas for parallel transport on volumes which have been seen in the case of
surfaces.

rise to moir\'e structures with emergent electronic properties. Electrons in
these moir\'e structures feel weak potentials that are typically in the tens of
millielectronvolt range when the moir\'e structures are smooth at the atomic
scale. Here we report a facile technique to achieve deep, deterministic
trapping potentials via strain-based moir\'e engineering in van der Waals
bilayers. We use elasto-scanning tunneling microscopy to show that uniaxial
strain drives a commensurate-incommensurate lattice transition in a multilayer
MoSe$_2$ system. In the incommensurate state, the top monolayer is partially
detached from the bulk through the spontaneous formation of topological
solitons where stress is relieved. Intersecting solitons form a honeycomb-like
network resulting from the three-fold symmetry of the adhesion potential
between layers. The vertices of the honeycomb network occur in bound pairs with
different interlayer stacking arrangements. One vertex of the pair is found to
be an efficient trap for electrons, displaying two states that are deeply
confined within the semiconductor gap and have a spatial extent of 2 nm.
Honeycomb soliton networks thus provide a unique path to engineer an array of
identical deeply confined states with a strain-dependent tunable spatial
separation, without the necessity of introducing chemical defects into the host
materials.

latent scale-invariant $R^2$, a novel measure of variation explained for an
observed binary outcome and an observed continuous predictor, and then directly
link the latent $R^2$ to AUC. This enables a mutually consistent simultaneous
use of AUC as a measure of classification accuracy and the latent $R^2$ as a
scale-invariant measure of explained variation. Specifically, we employ
Semiparametric Gaussian Copula (SGC) to model a joint dependence between
observed binary outcome and observed continuous predictor via the correlation
of latent standard normal random variables. Under SGC, we show how, both
population-level AUC and latent scale-invariant $R^2$, defined as a squared
latent correlation, can be estimated using any of the four rank statistics
calculated on binary-continuous pairs: Wilcoxon rank-sum, Kendall's Tau,
Spearman's Rho, and Quadrant rank correlations. We then focus on three
implications and applications: i) we explicitly show that under SGC, the
population-level AUC and the population-level latent $R^2$ are related via a
monotone function that depends on the population-level prevalence rate, ii) we
propose Quadrant rank correlation as a robust semiparametric version of AUC;
iii) we demonstrate how, under complex-survey designs, Wilcoxon rank sum
statistics and Spearman and Quadrant rank correlations provide asymptotically
consistent estimators of the population-level AUC using only single-participant
survey weights. We illustrate these applications using binary outcome of

cosmological simulations often use ad hoc feedback parameters. Conversely,
small-box simulations, while better resolving the feedback, cannot capture gas
evolution beyond the simulation domain. We aim to bridge the gap by
implementing small-box results of supernovae-driven outflows into dark matter
halo-scale simulations and studying their impact on large scales. Galactic
outflows are multiphase, but small-box simulations show that the hot phase
(T$\approx$ 10$^{6-7}$ K) carries the majority of energy and metals. We
implement hot outflows in idealized simulations of the Milky Way halo, and
examine how they impact the circumgalactic medium (CGM). In this paper, we
discuss the case when the star formation surface density is low and therefore
the emerging hot outflows are gravitationally bound by the halo. We find that
outflows form a large-scale, metal-enriched atmosphere with fountain motions.
As hot gas accumulates, the inner atmosphere becomes ""saturated"". Cool gas
condenses, with a rate balancing the injection of the hot outflows. This
balance leads to a universal density profile of the hot atmosphere, independent
of mass outflow rate. The atmosphere has a radially-decreasing temperature,
naturally producing the observed X-ray luminosity and column densities of O VI,
O VII, O VIII. The self-regulated atmosphere has a baryon and a metal mass of
$(0.5-1.2)\times 10^{10}M_\odot$ and $(0.6-1.4)\times 10^8 M_\odot$,
respectively, small compared to the ``missing"" baryons and metals from the

that the weight of the initial state of the matrix is increased, and a more

interactions of many latent factors behind the users' decision making
processes. The factors are highly entangled, and may range from high-level ones
that govern user intentions, to low-level ones that characterize a user's
preference when executing an intention. Learning representations that uncover
and disentangle these latent factors can bring enhanced robustness,
interpretability, and controllability. However, learning such disentangled
representations from user behavior is challenging, and remains largely
neglected by the existing literature. In this paper, we present the MACRo-mIcro
Disentangled Variational Auto-Encoder (MacridVAE) for learning disentangled
representations from user behavior. Our approach achieves macro disentanglement
by inferring the high-level concepts associated with user intentions (e.g., to
buy a shirt or a cellphone), while capturing the preference of a user regarding
the different concepts separately. A micro-disentanglement regularizer,
stemming from an information-theoretic interpretation of VAEs, then forces each
dimension of the representations to independently reflect an isolated low-level
factor (e.g., the size or the color of a shirt). Empirical results show that
our approach can achieve substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art
baselines. We further demonstrate that the learned representations are
interpretable and controllable, which can potentially lead to a new paradigm
for recommendation where users are given fine-grained control over targeted
aspects of the recommendation lists.

hybrid beamformers with common analog beamformer for the entire band while

Furthermore, the performance mostly relies on the perfectness of the channel

hybrid beamformer design in broadband mm-Wave massive MIMO systems. We design a

proposed CNN architecture is trained with imperfect channel matrices in order
to provide robust performance against the deviations in the channel data.
Hence, the proposed precoding scheme can handle the imperfect or limited

$L_1$ and $L_2$, are an integral part of many learning algorithms. Both the
regularizers mentioned above are formulated by assuming certain priors in the
parameter space and these assumptions, in some cases, induce sparsity in the
parameter space. Regularizers help in transferring beliefs one has on the
dataset or the parameter space by introducing adequate terms in the loss
function. Any kind of formulation represents a specific set of beliefs: $L_1$
regularization conveys that the parameter space should be sparse whereas $L_2$
regularization conveys that the parameter space should be bounded and
continuous. These regularizers in turn leverage certain priors to express these
inherent beliefs. A better understanding of how the prior affects the behavior
of the parameters and how the priors can be updated based on the dataset can
contribute greatly in improving the generalization capabilities of a function
estimator. In this work, we introduce a weakly informative prior and then
further extend it to an informative prior in order to formulate a
regularization penalty, which shows better results in terms of inducing
sparsity experimentally, when compared to regularizers based only on Gaussian
and Laplacian priors. Experimentally, we verify that a regularizer based on an
adapted prior improves the generalization capabilities of any network. We
illustrate the performance of the proposed method on the MNIST and CIFAR-10

processes, or feedback from AGN is unclear. To help disentangle the physical
mechanisms at work by addressing the latter, we study the galaxy size -
Mstellar relation of 32 carefully-selected broad-line AGN hosts at 1.2 < z <
1.7 (7.5 < log M_BH < 8.5; L_bol/L_Edd > 0.1). Using HST with multi-band
photometry and state-of-the-art modeling techniques, we measure half-light
radii while accounting for uncertainties from subtracting bright central point
sources. We find AGN hosts to have sizes ranging from 1 to 6 kpc at Mstellar ~
0.3 - 1 x 10^11 Msun. Thus, many hosts have intermediate sizes as compared to
equal-mass star-forming and quiescent galaxies. While inconsistent with the
idea that AGN feedback may induce an increase in galaxy sizes, this finding is
consistent with hypotheses in which AGNs preferentially occur in systems with
prior concentrated gas reservoirs, or are involved in secular compaction
processes perhaps responsible for simultaneously building bulges and shutting
down star formation. If driven by minor mergers, which do not grow central
black holes as fast as they do bulge-like stellar structures, such a process
would explain both the galaxy size - mass relation observed here and the
evolution in the black hole, bulge mass relation described in a companion

utilising a fermion action exposed to additive mass renormalisations. In this
case, the background field can induce an undesired field-dependent additive
mass renormalisation that acts to change the quark mass as the background field
is changed. For example, in a calculation utilising Wilson fermions in a
uniform background magnetic field, the Wilson term introduced a field-dependent
renormalisation to the quark mass which manifests itself in an unphysical
increase of the neutral-pion mass for large magnetic fields. Herein, the clover
fermion action is studied to determine the extent to which the removal of
$\mathcal{O}(a)$ discretisation errors suppresses the field-dependent changes
to the quark mass. We illustrate how a careful treatment of nonperturbative
improvement is necessary to resolve this artefact of the Wilson term. Using the

matchers (e.g., deep Siamese networks) that typically rely on a reference
gallery with one still image per individual. However, generating synthetic
images in the source domain may not improve the performance during operations
due to the domain shift w.r.t. the target domain. Moreover, despite the
emergence of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for realistic synthetic
generation, it is often difficult to control the conditions under which
synthetic faces are generated. In this paper, a cross-domain face synthesis
approach is proposed that integrates a new Controllable GAN (C-GAN). It employs
an off-the-shelf 3D face model as a simulator to generate face images under
various poses. The simulated images and noise are input to the C-GAN for
realism refinement which employs an additional adversarial game as a third
player to preserve the identity and specific facial attributes of the refined
images. This allows generating realistic synthetic face images that reflects
capture conditions in the target domain while controlling the GAN output to
generate faces under desired pose conditions. Experiments were performed using
videos from the Chokepoint and COX-S2V datasets, and a deep Siamese network for
FR with a single reference still per person. Results indicate that the proposed

proving a large pool of candidates from which the targets for the search for
life beyond the Solar system will be chosen. The target selection process will
require the leveraging of all available information in order to maximise the
robustness of the target list and make the most productive use of follow-up
resources. Here, we present the results of a suite of $n$-body simulations that
demonstrate the degree to which the orbital architecture of the Solar system
impacts the variability of Earth's orbital elements. By varying the orbit of
Jupiter and keeping the initial orbits of the other planets constant, we
demonstrate how subtle changes in Solar system architecture could alter the
Earth's orbital evolution -- a key factor in the Milankovitch cycles that alter
the amount and distribution of solar insolation, thereby driving periodic
climate change on our planet. The amplitudes and frequencies of Earth's modern
orbital cycles fall in the middle of the range seen in our runs for all
parameters considered -- neither unusually fast nor slow, nor large nor small.
This finding runs counter to the `Rare Earth' hypothesis, which suggests that
conditions on Earth are so unusual that life elsewhere is essentially
impossible. Our results highlight how dynamical simulations of newly discovered
exoplanetary systems could be used as an additional means to assess the
potential targets of biosignature searches, and thereby help focus the search
for life to the most promising targets.

underutilized due to the uneven distribution of computation resource in time

paper proposes a computation resource leasing (CRL) concept using priority as
an intermediary to restore and exchange the permission for computation resource

is able to gain priority as a reward for leasing its computing resource to
others. CRL also offers a priority oriented algorithm to match the computation

two-stage knowledge-based planning (KBP) pipelines to produce radiation therapy
treatment plans. We trained two dose prediction methods, a generative
adversarial network (GAN) and a random forest (RF) with the same 130 treatment
plans. The models were applied to 87 out-of-sample patients to create two sets
of predicted dose distributions that were used as input to two optimization
models. The first optimization model, inverse planning (IP), estimates weights
for dose-objectives from a predicted dose distribution and generates new plans
using conventional inverse planning. The second optimization model, dose
mimicking (DM), minimizes the sum of one-sided quadratic penalties between the
predictions and the generated plans using several dose-objectives. Altogether,
four KBP pipelines (GAN-IP, GAN-DM, RF-IP, and RF-DM) were constructed and
benchmarked against the corresponding clinical plans using clinical criteria;
the error of both prediction methods was also evaluated. The best performing
plans were GAN-IP plans, which satisfied the same criteria as their
corresponding clinical plans (78%) more often than any other KBP pipeline.
However, GAN did not necessarily provide the best prediction for the
second-stage optimization models. Specifically, both the RF-IP and RF-DM plans
satisfied all clinical criteria 25% and 15% more often than GAN-DM plans (the
worst performing planning), respectively. GAN predictions also had a higher
mean absolute error (3.9 Gy) than those from RF (3.6 Gy). We find that
state-of-the-art prediction methods when paired with different optimization
algorithms, produce treatment plans with considerable variation in quality.

mutual consistency of the quasi-normal mode spectrum. We use Bayesian inference

years, and lots of efforts have been put into inventing more robust models to
solve this problem. With the fast evolution of deep learning techniques, some
deep neural network-based language models are becoming dominant. Notably, the
transformer structure has been proven to be very efficient and promising in
modeling texts. However, the transformer-based language models usually contain
huge number of parameters and the size of the model is usually too large to put
in production for some storage limited applications. In this paper, we propose
a parameter sharing decoder pair (PSDP), which reduces the number of parameters
dramatically and at the same time maintains the capability of generating
understandable and reasonable compositions. Works created by the proposed model
are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model.

these modifications using a potential of the form $V^{\prime}(r)=-\frac{GMm}{r}
[1+\alpha \exp{(-r/\lambda)}]$. The best present constraints on $\alpha$ for
$\lambda <100$\,nm come from neutron scattering and often employ comparisons of
different measurements of the coherent neutron scattering amplitudes $b$. We
analyze the internal consistency of existing data from two different types of
measurements of low energy neutron scattering amplitudes: neutron
interferometry, which involves squared momentum transfers $q^{2}=0$, and
neutron gravity reflectometry, which involves squared momentum transfers
$q^{2}=8mV_{opt}$ where $m$ is the neutron mass and $V_{opt}$ is the neutron
optical potential of the medium. We show that the fractional difference
$\frac{\Delta b}{|b|}$ averaged over the 7 elements where high precision data
exists on the same material from both measurement methods is $[2.2 \pm 1.4]
\times 10^{-4}$. We also show that $\frac{\Delta b}{|b|}$ for this data is
insensitive both to exotic Yukawa interactions and also to the electromagnetic
neutron-atom interactions proportional to the neutron-electron scattering
length $b_{ne}$ and the neutron polarizability scattering amplitude $b_{pol}$.
This result will be useful in any future global analyses of neutron scattering
data to determine $b_{ne}$ and bound $\alpha$ and $\lambda$. We also discuss
how various neutron interferometric and scattering techniques with cold and
ultracold neutrons can be used to improve the precision of $b$ measurements and
make some specific proposals.

reprogrammable multi-mission bias encoded metasurface is proposed for dynamic
THz wavefront engineering by employing VO2 reversible and fast monoclinic to
tetragonal phase transition. The multi-functionality of our designed VO2 based
coding metasurface (VBCM) was guaranteed by elaborately designed meta-atom
comprising three-patterned VO2 thin films whose operational statuses can be
dynamically tuned among four states of ""00""- ""11"" by merely changing the
biasing voltage controlled by an external FPGA platform. Capitalizing on such
meta-atom design and by driving VBCM with different spiral-like and
spiral-parabola-like coding sequences, single vortex beam and focused vortex
beam with interchangeable OAM modes were satisfactorily generated respectively.
Additionally, by adopting superposition theorem and convolution operation,
symmetric/asymmetric multiple beams and arbitrarily-oriented multiple vortex
beams in pre-demined directions with different topological charges are
realized. The versatility of our designed VBCM also has equipped a platform to
focus the incident THz wavefront into a pre-determined point which can be
dynamically altered. Several illustrative examples successfully have clarified
that proposed VBCM is a promising candidate for solving crucial THz challenges
such as high data rate wireless communication where ultrafast switching between
several missions is required.

beamforming to wirelessly charge multiple users. By using the harvested energy,
the actively computing user nodes can offload their computation tasks to nearby
idle users (as helper nodes) via D2D communication links for self-sustainable
remote computing. We consider the frequency division multiple access (FDMA)
protocol, such that the D2D communications of different user-helper pairs are
implemented over orthogonal frequency bands. Furthermore, we focus on a
particular time block for task execution, which is divided into three slots for
computation task offloading, remote computing, and result downloading,
respectively, at different user-helper pairs. Under this setup, we jointly
optimize the collaborative energy beamforming at ETs, the communication and
computation resource allocation at users and helpers, and the user-helper
pairing, so as to maximize the sum computation rate (i.e., the number of task
input-bits executed over this block) of the users, subject to individual energy
neutrality constraints at both users and helpers. First, we consider the
computation rate maximization problem under any given user-helper pairs, for
which an efficient solution is proposed by using the techniques of alternating
optimization and convex optimization. Next, we develop the optimal user-helper
pairing scheme based on exhaustive search and a low-complexity scheme based on
greedy selection. Numerical results show that the proposed design significantly
improves the sum computation rate at users, as compared to benchmark schemes

this system exhibits a complex behavior, resulting from the competing action of
two distinct instabilities: ferromagnetism, which promotes spin
anticorrelations and domain formation; and pairing, that renders the repulsive
fermionic atoms unstable towards forming weakly bound bosonic molecules. The
breakdown of the homogeneous repulsive Fermi liquid arising from such
concurrent mechanisms has been recently observed in real time through
pump-probe spectroscopic techniques [A. Amico et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 121,

metastable many-body state, an unpredicted quantum emulsion of anticorrelated

exotic regime by studying the evolution of kinetic and release energies, the
spectral response and coherence of the unpaired fermionic population, and its
spin-density noise correlations. All our observations consistently point to a
low-temperature heterogeneous phase, where paired and unpaired fermions
macroscopically coexist while featuring micro-scale phase separation. Our
findings open new appealing avenues for the exploration of quantum emulsions

with a nontrivial photonic Chern number ($C\neq 0$) for electromagnetic waves
coupled to a quantum Hall fluid. The interplay of symmetry and topology is also
captured by the spin-1 representations of a photonic skyrmion at high-symmetry
points in the Brillouin zone. To rigorously analyze the topological physics, we
introduce the viscous Maxwell-Chern-Simons Lagrangian and derive the equations
of motion, as well as the boundary conditions, from the principle of least
action. We discover topologically-protected chiral (unidirectional) edge states
which minimize the surface variation and correspond to massless photonic
excitations costing an infinitesimal amount of energy. Physically, our
predicted electromagnetic phases are connected to a dynamical photonic mass in
the integer quantum Hall fluid. This arises from viscous (nonlocal) Hall
conductivity and we identify the nonlocal Chern-Simons coupling with the Hall
viscosity. The electromagnetic phase is topologically nontrivial $C\neq 0$ when
the Hall viscosity inhibits the total bulk Hall response. Our work bridges the
gap between electromagnetic and condensed matter topological physics while also
demonstrating the central role of spin-1 quantization in nontrivial photonic
phases.

this work, a large number of Granger causality measures used to form causality
networks from multivariate time series are assessed. These measures are in the
time domain, such as model-based and information measures, the frequency domain
and the phase domain. The study aims also to compare bivariate and multivariate
measures, linear and nonlinear measures, as well as the use of dimension
reduction in linear model-based measures and information measures. The latter
is particular relevant in the study of high-dimensional time series. For the
performance of the multivariate causality measures, low and high dimensional
coupled dynamical systems are considered in discrete and continuous time, as
well as deterministic and stochastic. The measures are evaluated and ranked
according to their ability to provide causality networks that match the
original coupling structure. The simulation study concludes that the Granger
causality measures using dimension reduction are superior and should be
preferred particularly in studies involving many observed variables, such as
multi-channel electroencephalograms and financial markets.

in conjunction with a specific vanishing horizon limit, the so-called Extremal
Vanishing Horizon (EVH) limit, the AdS$_2$ factor lifts to a locally AdS$_3$
factor with a pinching angular direction. In this paper, we study the EVH limit
of asymptotically AdS black holes which preserve some supersymmetry. The
primary example we consider is the 1/16$^{\rm th}$ BPS asymptotically AdS$_5$
black hole, whose EVH limit has an AdS$_3$ factor in its near-horizon geometry.
We also consider the near-EVH limit of this black hole, in which the
near-horizon geometry instead contains an extremal BTZ factor. We employ recent
results on the large-$N$ limit of the superconformal index of the dual CFT$_4$
to understand the emergence of a CFT$_2$ in the IR of the CFT$_4$, which is the
field theory dual to the emergence of the locally AdS$_3$ factor in the
near-horizon geometry. In particular, we show that the inverse Laplace
transform of the superconformal index, yielding the black hole entropy, becomes
equivalent to the derivation of a Cardy formula for the dual CFT$_2$. Finally,
we examine the EVH limit of supersymmetric black holes in other dimensions.

depending on the program run so far, with the aim of fulfilling a given

executes actions that the system cannot control. In contrast to the case of

An alphabet reflects the number of processes that are static but unknown. The
synthesis problem then asks whether there is a finite number of processes for
which the system can satisfy the specification. This variant is already
undecidable for very limited logics. Therefore, we consider a first-order logic
without the order on word positions. We show that even in this restricted case
synthesis is undecidable if both the system and the environment have access to
all processes. On the other hand, we prove that the problem is decidable if the
environment only has access to a bounded number of processes. In that case,
there is even a cutoff meaning that it is enough to examine a bounded number of

from its topologically trivial to nontrivial phase in the presence of couplings
to nonthermal Markovian baths. We consider two distinctive situations: In the
first situation, the bath is quasilocal in the site basis (local in
quasiparticle basis) while in the other it is local. Following a Lindbladian
approach, we compute the early time dynamics as well as the asymptotic behavior
of the edge-Majorana correlation to probe the interplay between two competing
timescales - one due to the coherent ramping while the other to the dissipative
coupling. For the quasilocal bath, we establish that there is a steady
generation of Majorana correlations in asymptotic time and the presence of an
optimal ramping time which facilitates a quicker approach to the topological
steady state. In the second scenario, we analyze the action of a local
particle-loss type of bath in which we have established the existence of an
optimal ramping time which results from the competing dynamics between the
unitary ramp and the dissipative coupling. While the defect generated by the
former decays exponentially with increasing ramp duration, the later scales
linearly with the same. This linear scaling is further established through a
perturbation theory formulated using the nondimensionalized coupling to the
bath as a small parameter.

a requirement on the Dirac field: that its energy flux should vanish at
asymptotic infinity. A set of two Robin boundary conditions compatible with
QNMs is consequently found. By employing both analytic and numeric methods, we
then obtain the quasinormal spectrum for charged Dirac fields, and analyse the
impact of various parameters, in particular of electric charge. An analytic
calculation shows explicitly that the charge coupling between the black hole

eventually motivates the problem concerning their entanglement-assisted
discrimination. Here, we construct examples of genuinely nonlocal product
states for arbitrary number of parties. Strength of genuine nonlocality of
these sets can be considered minimal as their perfect discrimination is
possible with entangled resources residing in Hilbert spaces having the
smallest possible dimensions. Our constructions lead to fully separable
measurements that are impossible to implement even if all but one party come
together. Furthermore, they also provide the opportunity to compare different
multipartite states that otherwise are incomparable under single copy local
manipulation.

sparsely-scattered and dominated by a strong line-of-sight (LOS) path.
Therefore, communication over such channels is in general extremely difficult
when the LOS path is not present. However, the recent introduction of
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which have the potential to
influence the propagation environment in a controlled manner, has the potential
to change the previous paradigm. Motivated by this, we study the channel
capacity optimization utilizing RISs in indoor mmWave environments where no LOS
path is present. More precisely, we propose two optimization schemes that
exploit the customizing capabilities of the RIS reflection elements in order to
maximize the channel capacity. The first optimization scheme exploits only the
adjustability of the RIS reflection elements; for this scheme we derive an
approximate expression which explains the connection between the channel
capacity gains and the system parameters. The second optimization scheme
jointly optimizes the RIS reflection elements and the transmit phase precoder;
for this scheme, we propose a low-complexity technique called global co-phasing
to determine the phase shift values for use at the RIS. Simulation results show
that the optimization of the RIS reflection elements produces a significant
channel capacity gain, and that this gain increases with the number of RIS
elements.

properties and star formation (SF) across a range of galactic environments.
Cloud populations in galaxy disks are considered to be representative of the
`normal' SF. At high resolution, however, clouds with exceptional gas
properties and SF activity may also be observed in normal disk environments. In
this paper, we study the brightest cloud traced in CO emission in the disk of
NGC628.
  The cloud is spatially coincident with an extremely bright HII region. We
characterize its molecular gas properties and investigate how feedback and
large-scale processes influence the properties of the molecular gas.
  High resolution CO ALMA observations are used to characterize its mass and
dynamical state, which are compared to other clouds in NGC628. A LVG analysis
is used to constrain the beam-diluted density and temperature of the molecular
gas. We analyze the MUSE spectrum using Starburst99 to characterize the young
stellar population associated with the HII region. The cloud is massive
($1-2\times10^7$M$_{\odot}$), with a beam-diluted density of $n_{\rm
H_2}=5\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$. It has a low virial parameter, suggesting that its
CO emission may be overluminous due to heating by the HII region. A young
($2-4$ Myr), massive $3\times10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$ stellar population is
associated.
  We argue that the cloud is currently being destroyed by feedback from young
massive stars. Due to the cloud's large mass, this phase of the cloud's
evolution is long enough for the impact of feedback on the excitation of the
gas to be observed. Its high mass may be related to its location at a spiral
co-rotation radius, where gas experiences reduced galactic shear compared to
other regions of the disk, and receives a sustained inflow of gas that can
promote the cloud's mass growth.

biodiversity patterns, ranging from the classical niche-based theories, mainly
employing a continuous formalism, to neutral theories, based on statistical

biodiversity can arise due to the discrete or continuous nature of the
underlying models and the way internal or external perturbations appear in
their formulations. Here, we trace the effects of stochastic population
dynamics on biodiversity, from the scale of the individuals to the community
and based on both discrete and continuous representations of the system, by
consistently using measures of community diversity like the species abundance
distribution and the rank abundance curve and applying them to both discrete
and continuous populations. A novel measure, the community abundance
distribution, is introduced to facilitate the comparison across different
levels of description, from microscopic to macroscopic. Using a simple birth
and death process and an interacting population model, we highlight
discrepancies in their discrete and continuous distributions and discuss
relevant implications for the analysis of rare species and extinction dynamics.
Quantitative consideration of these issues is useful for better understanding
of the contributions of non-neutral processes and the mathematical

deployment of powerful deep learning models at resource-constrained mobile
devices. The device-edge co-inference framework provides a promising solution
by splitting a neural network at a mobile device and an edge computing server.
In order to balance the on-device computation and the communication overhead,
the splitting point needs to be carefully picked, while the intermediate
feature needs to be compressed before transmission. Existing studies decoupled
the design of model splitting, feature compression, and communication, which
may lead to excessive resource consumption of the mobile device. In this paper,
we introduce an end-to-end architecture, named BottleNet++, that consists of an
encoder, a non-trainable channel layer, and a decoder for more efficient
feature compression and transmission. The encoder and decoder essentially
implement joint source-channel coding via convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
while explicitly considering the effect of channel noise. By exploiting the
strong sparsity and the fault-tolerant property of the intermediate feature in
a deep neural network (DNN), BottleNet++ achieves a much higher compression
ratio than existing methods. Furthermore, by providing the channel condition to
the encoder as an input, our method enjoys a strong generalization ability in
different channel conditions. Compared with merely transmitting intermediate
data without feature compression, BottleNet++ achieves up to 64x bandwidth
reduction over the additive white Gaussian noise channel and up to 256x bit
compression ratio in the binary erasure channel, with less than 2% reduction in
accuracy. With a higher compression ratio, BottleNet++ enables splitting a DNN
at earlier layers, which leads to up to 3x reduction in on-device computation
compared with other compression methods.

Hadron Collider (LHC) search for Higgs bosons and sparticles, it is becoming
difficult for the neutralino dark matter in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model and the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model to possess these
two seemingly paradoxical features in their most natural parameter space for
electroweak symmetry breaking due to the limited theoretical structure. In
contrast, the seesaw extension of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model, which was initially proposed to solve the neutrino mass problem, enables
the lightest sneutrino to act as a viable dark matter candidate, readily has
these features, and thus, it easily satisfies the constraints from dark matter
and LHC experiments. Compared with the Type-I seesaw extension, the dark matter
physics in the inverse seesaw extension is more flexible, allowing it to be
consistent with the experimental results in broader parameter space. We
conclude that weakly interacting massive particles (such as the sneutrino in
this study) work well in supersymmetric theories as dark matter candidates.

most state-of-the-art denoisers cannot be posed as a proximal operator, one
cannot guarantee the convergence of these so-called plug-and-play (PnP)
algorithms. In fact, the theoretical convergence of PnP algorithms is an active
research topic. In this letter, we consider the result of Chan et al. (IEEE
TCI, 2017), where fixed-point convergence of an ADMM-based PnP algorithm was
established for a class of denoisers. We argue that the original proof is
incomplete, since convergence is not analyzed for one of the three possible
cases outlined in the paper. Moreover, we explain why the argument for the
other cases does not apply in this case. We give a different analysis to fill
this gap, which firmly establishes the original convergence theorem.

from the research society recently, which creates favorable propagation
conditions by controlling the phase shifts of the reflected waves at the

downlink multi-user system where the transmission from a multi-antenna base
station (BS) to various users is achieved by the RIS reflecting the incident
signals of the BS towards the users. Unlike most existing works, we consider
the practical case where only a limited number of discrete phase shifts can be
realized by the finite-sized RIS. Based on the reflection-dominated one-hop
propagation model between the BS and users via the RIS, a hybrid beamforming
scheme is proposed and the sum-rate maximization problem is formulated.
Specifically, the continuous digital beamforming and discrete RIS-based analog
beamforming are performed at the BS and the RIS, respectively, and an iterative
algorithm is designed to solve this problem. Both theoretical analysis and
numerical validations show that the RIS-based system can achieve a good
sum-rate performance by setting a reasonable size of RIS and a small number of

signatures of particle acceleration and radiative cooling. Significant
correlations with near-zero lag were seen between various optical/infra-red

a time lag of about 10--100 days are seen between optical/infra-red and radio

similar exoplanets) was transported inwards via (giant) collisions during the
chaotic final phase of planet formation. In dynamical simulations water
delivery is still studied almost exclusively by assuming oversimplified perfect
merging (PM), even though it is particularly prone to collisional transfer and
loss. To close this gap we have developed a framework to model collisional
water transport by direct combination of long-term N-body computations with
dedicated 3D SPH simulations for each collision. Post-collision water
inventories are self-consistently traced further, in accretionary or erosive as
well as hit-and-run encounters. The latter are frequent outcomes among
protoplanets, where besides collisional losses, water transfer between the
encountering bodies has to be considered. This hybrid approach enables us for
the first time to trace the full dynamical and collisional evolution of ~200
bodies throughout the whole late-stage accretion phase (several 100 Myrs). As a
first application we choose a Solar System-like architecture, with already
formed giant planets on either circular or eccentric orbits and a debris disk
spanning from 0.5 - 4 au. Realistic collision treatment leads to considerably
different results than PM, with lower mass planets and water inventories
reduced by a factor of two or more. Due to a combination of collisional losses
and considerably lengthened accretion, final water contents especially with
giant planets on circular orbits are strongly reduced to more Earth-like
values. Water delivery to potentially habitable planets is dominated by few
decisive collisions, mostly with embryo-sized or larger bodies. The high
frequency of hit-and-run, with generally low water (and mass) transfer
efficiencies, are a crucial part of this process, and of system-wide evolution
in general.

chemical peculiarity, atomic diffusion is often neglected because, on its own,
it causes unrealistic surface abundances compared with those observed. The
reality is that atomic diffusion is in competition with other transport
processes. The purpose of this study is to quantify the opposite or conjugated
effects of atomic diffusion and rotationally induced mixing in stellar models
of low mass stars. Our second goal is to estimate the impact of neglecting both
rotational mixing and atomic diffusion in stellar parameter inferences for
stars with masses larger than 1.3Msun. Using the AIMS code, we infer the masses
and ages of a set of representative artificial stars for which models were
computed with the CESTAM evolution code, taking into account rotationally
induced mixing and atomic diffusion, including radiative accelerations. We show
that for masses lower than 1.3Msun, rotation dominates the transport of
chemical elements, and strongly reduces the effect of atomic diffusion, with
net surface abundance modifications similar to solar ones. At larger mass,
atomic diffusion and rotation are competing equally. Above 1.44Msun, atomic
diffusion dominates in stellar models with initial rotation smaller than
80km.s-1 producing a chemical peculiarity which is not observed in
Kepler-legacy stars. This indicates that a transport process of chemical
elements is missing. Importantly, neglecting rotation and atomic diffusion
(including radiative accelerations) in the models, when inferring the
parameters of F-type stars, may lead to errors of 5%, 2.5% and 25% respectively
for stellar masses, radii and ages. Atomic diffusion (including radiative
accelerations) and rotational mixing should be taken into account in stellar
models in order to determine accurate stellar parameters.

competing effects of internal viscous dissipation and external torques. We
study this coupled evolution for a model magnetar with a strong internal
toroidal field, extending previous work by modelling -- for the first time in
this context -- the strong proto-magnetar wind acting shortly after birth. We
also account for the effect of buoyancy forces on viscous dissipation at late
times. Typically we find that $\chi\to 90^\circ$ shortly after birth, then
decreases towards $0^\circ$ over hundreds of years. From observational
indications that magnetars typically have small $\chi$, we infer that these
stars are subject to a stronger average exterior torque than radio pulsars, and
that they were born spinning faster than $\sim 100-300$ Hz. Our results allow
us to make quantitative predictions for the gravitational and electromagnetic

information from their surroundings in order to reduce uncertainty. Here we
take this computational approach using a simple bit string model of coevolving
agents and their parasites. While agents try to predict their worlds, parasites
do the same with their hosts. The result of this process is that, in order to
escape their parasites, the host agents expand their computational complexity
despite the cost of maintaining it. This, in turn, is followed by increasingly
complex parasitic counterparts. Such arms races display several qualitative
phases, from monotonous to punctuated evolution or even ecological collapse.
Our minimal model illustrates the relevance of parasites in providing an active
mechanism for expanding living complexity beyond simple replicators, suggesting
that parasitic agents are likely to be a major evolutionary driver for
biological complexity.

diagrams, and often to tree-level exchange or contact diagrams. An important
example is the computation of the finite coupling 4-point function of the
large-$N$ conformal $O(N)$ model on $AdS_3$. Remarkably, the re-summation of
bubble diagrams is equal to a tree-level contact diagram: the
$\bar{D}_{1,1,\frac{3}{2},\frac{3}{2}} (z,\bar z)$ function. Another example is
a scalar with $\phi^4$ or $\phi^3$ coupling in $AdS_3$: we compute various
4-point (and higher point) loop bubble diagrams with alternating integer and
half-integer scaling dimensions in terms of a finite sum of contact diagrams
and tree-level exchange diagrams. The 4-point function with external scaling
dimensions differences obeying $\Delta_{12}=0$ and $\Delta_{34}=1$ enjoys
significant simplicity which enables us to compute in quite generality. For
integer or half-integer scaling dimensions, we show that the $M$-loop bubble
diagram can be written in terms of Lerch transcendent functions of the
cross-ratios $z$ and $\bar z$. Finally, we compute 2-point bulk bubble diagrams
with endpoints in the bulk, and the result can be written in terms of Lerch
transcendent functions of the AdS chordal distance. We show that the similarity
of the latter two computations is not a coincidence, but arises from a vertex
identity between the bulk 2-point function and the double-discontinuity of the
boundary 4-point function.

electrons with the help of femtosecond laser pulses in nanophotonic structures.
We demonstrate here the generation of a train of electron pulses with
individual pulse durations as short as $270\pm80$ attoseconds(FWHM), measured
in an indirect fashion, based on two subsequent dielectric laser interaction
regions connected by a free-space electron drift section, all on a single
photonic chip. In the first interaction region (the modulator), an energy
modulation is imprinted on the electron pulse. During free propagation, this
energy modulation evolves into a charge density modulation, which we probe in
the second interaction region (the analyzer). These results will lead to new
ways of probing ultrafast dynamics in matter and are essential for future
laser-based particle accelerators on a photonic chip.

  shortened to respect arXiv's limit of 1920 characters",,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Consider the following ""local"" cut-detection problem in a directed graph: We
are given a seed vertex $x$ and need to remove at most $k$ edges so that at
most $\nu$ edges can be reached from $x$ (a ""local"" cut) or output $\bot$ to
indicate that no such cut exists. If we are given query access to the input
graph, then this problem can in principle be solved without reading the whole
graph and with query complexity depending on $k$ and $\nu$. In this paper we
consider a slack variant of this problem where, when such a cut exists, we can
output a cut with up to $O(k\nu)$ edges reachable from $x$.
  We present a simple randomized algorithm spending $O(k^2\nu)$ time and
$O(k\nu)$ queries for the above variant, improving in particular a previous
time bound of $O(k^{O(k)}\nu)$ by Chechik et al. [SODA '17]. We also extend our
algorithm to handle an approximate variant. We demonstrate that these local
algorithms are versatile primitives for designing substantially improved
algorithms for classic graph problems by providing the following three
applications. (Throughout, $\tilde O(T)$ hides $\operatorname{polylog}(T)$.)
(1) A randomized algorithm for the classic $k$-vertex connectivity problem that
takes near-linear time when $k=O(\operatorname{polylog}(n))$, namely $\tilde
O(m+nk^3)$ time in undirected graphs. For directed graphs our $\tilde
O(mk^2)$-time algorithm is near-linear when $k=O(\operatorname{polylog}(n))$.
Our techniques also yield an improved approximation scheme. (2) Property
testing algorithms for $k$-edge and -vertex connectivity with query
complexities that are near-linear in $k$, exponentially improving the
state-of-the-art. This resolves two open problems, one by Goldreich and Ron
[STOC '97] and one by Orenstein and Ron [Theor. Comput Sci. '11]. (3) A faster
algorithm for computing the maximal $k$-edge connected subgraphs, improving
prior work of Chechik et al. [SODA '17].

depending on the closeness to the ferroelectric quantum critical point. The
first mechanism rests on the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction, and the
second assumed a coupling to the soft transverse optical phonon. In their
comment Ruhman and Lee point out an error in our estimate of the deformation
potential coupling to the soft mode. We agree that this type of coupling cannot
explain the gigantic isotope effect observed experimentally, so that a
different coupling mechanism needs to be found. As for the first pairing
mechanism, Ruhman and Lee maintain the view expressed in their paper (Ruhman

usual longitudinal optical phonon mediated interaction operates is limited by
the Fermi energy. We object to this view and in this reply present evidence
that the cutoff energy is much larger. In a weak coupling system such as
SrTiO$_{3}$ the cutoff is given by the energy beyond which quasiparticles cease
to be well defined.

distribution provides the best fit to the non-linear PDF from SC for both
cosmologies, from $a=0.1$ to 1 and for scales characterized by the comoving
width of the Gaussian: $\sigma_G = 0.5, 1, 2$. To elucidate the effect of
cosmology, we examine the linear and non-linear growth rates through test
cases. For overdensities, when the two models have the same initial density
contrast, the differences due to cosmology are amplified in the non-linear
regime, whereas, if the two models have the same linear density contrast today,
then the differences in cosmology are damped in the non-linear regime. This
behaviour is in contrast with voids, where the non-linear growth becomes
`self-regulatory' and is less sensitive to cosmology and initial conditions. To
compare the PDFs, we examine the difference of the PDFs and evolution of the
width of the PDF. The trends with scale and redshift are as expected. A
tertiary aim of this paper was to check if the fitting form for the non-linear
density-velocity divergence relation, derived for constant equation of state
($w$) models by Nadkarni-Ghosh holds for the EDE model. We find that it does
with an accuracy of 4\%, thus increasing its range of validity.

archival data. The three blazars were chosen such that their flux and index
distributions have sufficient number of data points ($\geq$90) with relatively
less uncertainty ($\bar{\sigma_{err}^{2}}/\sigma^{2}$<0.2) in light curves.
Anderson-Darling (AD) test and histogram fitting shows that flux distribution
of FSRQ 3C273 is log-normal, while its photon index distribution is Gaussian.
This result is consistent with linear Gaussian perturbation in the particle
acceleration time-scale, which produces log-normal distribution in flux.
However, for two BL Lacs viz. Mkn501 and Mkn421, AD test shows that their flux
distributions are neither Gaussian nor log-normal, and their index
distributions are non-normal. The histogram fitting of Mkn501 and Mkn421,
suggests that their flux distributions are more likely to be a bi-modal, and
their index distributions are double Gaussian. Since, Sinha et al. (2018) had
shown that Gaussian distribution of index produces a log-normal distribution in
flux, double Gaussian distribution of index in Mkn501 and Mkn421 indicates that
their flux distributions are probably double log-normal. Observation of double
log-normal flux distribution with double Gaussian distribution in index
reaffirms two flux states hypothesis. Further, the difference observed in the
flux distribution of FSRQ (3C273) and BL Lacs (Mkn501 and Mkn421) at X-rays,
suggest that the low energy emitting electrons have a single log-normal flux
distribution while the high energy ones have a double log-normal flux

its value is needed for dark matter direct detection searches. On the other
hand, a precise and robust determination of the local dark matter density would
help us learn about the shape of the dark matter halo of our Galaxy, which
plays an important role in dark matter indirect detection searches, as well as
in many studies in astrophysics and cosmology. There are different methods
available to determine the local dark matter density. Among them, it is common
to study either the vertical kinematics of a selected group of tracers or the
rotation curve of the Milky Way. Recent estimates of the local dark matter
density have used the precise observations conducted by the ESA/Gaia mission.
However, in spite of the quality of the data released by Gaia's observations,
different analyses of the local dark matter density produce dissimilar results.
After a brief review of the most common methods to estimate the local density
of dark matter, here we argue about different explanations for the
discrepancies in the results of recent analyses. We finish by presenting new
approaches that have been proposed in the literature and could help us improve

  Millimeter Wave D2D Communication",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Millimeter wave (mmWave) device to device (D2D) communication is highly
susceptible to obstacles due to severe penetration losses and requires almost a
line of sight (LOS) communication path. D2D channel condition is local to
devices/user equipments (UEs) and hence is \textit{not} directly visible to the
base station (BS). Thus quality of the D2D channel needs to be propagated to BS
by UEs which may incur some delay. Hence the solution provided by BS to UEs
using this gathered channel information might become less useful to establish
communication due to moving obstacles. These types of obstacles might not be
known in advance and hence may cause unpredictable fluctuations to the D2D
channel quality. Hence we seek to learn the D2D channels using the finite
horizon partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework to model
the uncertainty in such kind of network environments with dynamic obstacles.
The objective is to minimize delay when channel quality deteriorates, by making
UEs choose locally the best possible decision between i) to continue on the
current relay link on which communication is taking place or ii) to switch to
another good relay by exploring other possible UEs in its locality. We derive
an optimal threshold policy which tells the UE to take appropriate decision
locally. Later, we give a simplified and easy to implement stationary threshold
policy which counts the number of successive acknowledgement failures, based on
which UE make appropriate decision locally. Through extensive simulation, we
demonstrate that our approach outperforms recent algorithms.

is known to what extent articulatory movements can be predicted only from
linguistic information, i.e., phoneme sequence. In this work, we estimate
articulatory movements from three different input representations: R1) acoustic
signal, R2) phoneme sequence, R3) phoneme sequence with timing information.
While an attention network is used for estimating articulatory movement in the
case of R2, BLSTM network is used for R1 and R3. Experiments with ten subjects'
acoustic-articulatory data reveal that the estimation techniques achieve an
average correlation coefficient of 0.85, 0.81, and 0.81 in the case of R1, R2,

phoneme sequence (R2) without any timing information, results in an estimation
performance similar to that using rich acoustic signal (R1), suggesting that
articulatory motion is primarily driven by the linguistic message. The
correlation coefficient is further improved to 0.88 when R1 and R3 are used
together for estimating articulatory movements.

manifestly Lepton Flavor Universality violating and gauge-invariant, are
expected to be particularly enhanced in $R_{K^*}$ for the dilepton mass region

these corrections to the $R_{K,K^*}$ observables do not exceed a few per mille

QED corrections to $R_{K,K^*}$. Finally, viable new physics contributions to
$R_{K,K^{*}}$ induced by the exchange of a massless dark-photon via
magnetic-dipole interactions, which provide the leading contribution to the
corresponding $B\to (K,K^*) \ell^+\ell^-$ amplitudes in this scenario, are
analyzed in light of the present $R_{K,K^{*}}$ anomalies.

Algorithms (EAs) in the broad sense that they evolve a probabilistic model
instead of a population. Many existing algorithms fall into this category.
Analogous to genetic drift in EAs, EDAs also encounter the phenomenon that
updates of the probabilistic model not justified by the fitness move the
sampling frequencies to the boundary values. This can result in a considerable
performance loss.
  This paper proves the first sharp estimates of the boundary hitting time of
the sampling frequency of a neutral bit for several univariate EDAs. For the
UMDA that selects $\mu$ best individuals from $\lambda$ offspring each
generation, we prove that the expected first iteration when the frequency of
the neutral bit leaves the middle range $[\tfrac 14, \tfrac 34]$ and the
expected first time it is absorbed in 0 or 1 are both $\Theta(\mu)$. The
corresponding hitting times are $\Theta(K^2)$ for the cGA with hypothetical
population size $K$. This paper further proves that for PBIL with parameters
$\mu$, $\lambda$, and $\rho$, in an expected number of $\Theta(\mu/\rho^2)$
iterations the sampling frequency of a neutral bit leaves the interval
$[\Theta(\rho/\mu),1-\Theta(\rho/\mu)]$ and then always the same value is
sampled for this bit, that is, the frequency approaches the corresponding
boundary value with maximum speed.
  For the lower bounds implicit in these statements, we also show exponential
tail bounds. If a bit is not neutral, but neutral or has a preference for ones,
then the lower bounds on the times to reach a low frequency value still hold.
An analogous statement holds for bits that are neutral or prefer the value
zero.

the permutation invariant sector of a module over the ring of polynomials of

every value of the spacetime dimension $D$, and so explicitly count and
parameterize the most general four photon and four graviton S-matrix at any

rise to these S-matrices. We then conjecture that the Regge growth of
S-matrices in all physically acceptable classical theories is bounded by $s^2$
at fixed $t$. A four parameter subset of the polynomial photon S-matrices
constructed above satisfies this Regge criterion. For gravitons, on the other
hand, no polynomial addition to the Einstein S-matrix obeys this bound for $D
\leq 6$. For $D \geq 7$ there is a single six derivative polynomial Lagrangian
consistent with our conjectured Regge growth bound. Our conjecture thus implies
that the Einstein four graviton S-matrix does not admit any physically
acceptable polynomial modifications for $D\leq 6$. A preliminary analysis also
suggests that every finite sum of pole exchange contributions to four graviton
scattering also such violates our conjectured Regge growth bound, at least when

$G_{2}^{\rm CD}$ exhibits a narrowing along both dimensions. These features are
not reproduced by models such as HIJING and AMPT. However, the observed
narrowing of the correlators from peripheral to central collisions is expected
to result from the stronger transverse flow profiles produced in more central
collisions and the longitudinal broadening is predicted to be sensitive to
momentum currents and the shear viscosity per unit of entropy density $\eta/s$
of the matter produced in the collisions. The observed broadening is found to
be consistent with the hypothesized lower bound of $\eta/s$ and is in
qualitative agreement with values obtained from anisotropic flow measurements.

Away regions contain the fragmentation products of the hard scatterings in
addition to the UE contribution, whereas particles in the Transverse region are

approximately 20% when going from 7 to 13 TeV. The plateau in the Transverse

by the probability distribution of its charged-particle multiplicity normalized

to model calculations using PYTHIA 8 and EPOS LHC. The overall agreement

p-$\Sigma^{0}$ correlation function is found to be sensitive to the strong
interaction, and driven by the interplay of the different spin and isospin

there is a need for a theoretical framework to measure the information leaked

probabilistic framework, Airavata, to estimate the information leakage in such

exact target model is difficult due to experimental uncertainty while inferring
model hyperparameters and stochastic nature of training to steal the target

uncertainty in estimating the target model under various extraction attacks
based on the subjective notion of probability. We validate the proposed

as geometric sequence decomposition with $k$-simplexes transform (GSD-ST), is
based on the concept of transforming an observed sequence to multiple
$k$-simplexes in a virtual $k$-dimensional space and correlating the volumes of
the transformed simplexes. Hence, GSD-ST turns the problem of decomposing $k$
geometric sequences into one of solving a $k$-th order polynomial equation. Our
technique has significance for wireless communications because sampled points
of a radio wave comprise a geometric sequence. This implies that GSD-ST is
capable of demodulating randomly combined radio waves, thereby eliminating the
effect of interference. To exemplify the potential of GSD-ST, we propose a new
radio access scheme, namely non-orthogonal interference-free radio access
(No-INFRA). Herein, GSD-ST enables the collision-free reception of
uncoordinated access requests. Numerical results show that No-INFRA effectively
resolves the colliding access requests when the interference is dominant.

in Pb-Pb and pp collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV with the ALICE
detector at the Large Hadron Collider are reported. The resonances are measured
at midrapidity ($|y|$ $<$ 0.5) via their hadronic decay channels and the
transverse momentum ($p_{\rm{T}}$) distributions are obtained for various
collision centrality classes up to $p_{\rm{T}}$ $=$ 20 GeV$/c$. The
$p_{\rm{T}}$-integrated yield ratio $\rm{K}^{*}(892)^{0}$$/$K in Pb-Pb
collisions shows significant suppression relative to pp collisions and
decreases towards more central collisions. In contrast, the $\phi(1020)$$/$K
ratio does not show any suppression. Furthermore, the measured
$\rm{K}^{*}(892)^{0}$$/$K ratio in central Pb-Pb collisions is significantly
suppressed with respect to the expectations based on a thermal model
calculation, while the $\phi(1020)$$/$K ratio agrees with the model prediction.
These measurements are an experimental demonstration of rescattering of
$\rm{K}^{*}(892)^{0}$ decay products in the hadronic phase of the collisions.
The $\rm{K}^{*}(892)^{0}$$/$K yield ratios in Pb-Pb and pp collisions are used
to estimate the time duration between chemical and kinetic freeze-out, which is
found to be $\sim$ 4-7 fm$/c$ for central collisions. The
$p_{\rm{T}}$-differential ratios of $\rm{K}^{*}(892)^{0}$$/$K,
$\phi(1020)$$/$K, $\rm{K}^{*}(892)^{0}$$/\pi$, $\phi(1020)$$/\pi$,
$p/$$\rm{K}^{*}(892)^{0}$ and $p/$$\phi(1020)$ are also presented for Pb-Pb and
pp collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ $=$ 5.02 TeV. These ratios show that the
rescattering effect is predominantly a low-$p_{\rm{T}}$ phenomenon.

interpretable model that is trained on instances in the vicinity of the

of the non-zero features of the predicted instance. After that, the perturbed
instances are fed into the black-box model to obtain labels for these, which
are then used for training the interpretable model. In this study, we present a
systematic evaluation of the interpretable models that are output by LIME on
the two use-cases that were considered in the original paper introducing the
approach; text classification and object detection. The investigation shows
that the perturbation and labeling phases result in both data and label shift.
In addition, we study the correlation between the shift and the fidelity of the
interpretable model and show that in certain cases the shift negatively
correlates with the fidelity. Based on these findings, it is argued that there
is a need for a new sampling approach that mitigates the shift in the LIME's

arrested due to the formation of disorder-induced resonances. Hitherto,
Anderson localization has been demonstrated separately in two limits of
disorder, namely, amorphous disorder and nearly-periodic disorder. However,
transport properties in the two limits are yet unstudied, particularly in a
statistically consistent manner. Here, we experimentally measure light
transport across two-dimensional open mesoscopic structures, wherein the
disorder systematically ranges from nearly-periodic to amorphous. We measure
the generalized conductance, which quantifies the transport probability in the
sample. Although localization was identified in both the limits, statistical
measurements revealed a discrepant behavior in the generalized conductance
fluctuations in the two disorder regimes. Under amorphous disorder, the
generalized conductance remains below unity for any configuration of the
disorder, attesting to the arrested nature of transport. Contrarily, at
near-periodic disorder, the distribution of generalized conductance is
heavy-tailed towards large conductance values, indicating that the overall
transport is delocalized. Theoretical results from a model based on the
tight-binding approximation, augmented to include open boundaries, are in
excellent agreement with experiments, and also endorse the results over much
larger ensembles. These results quantify the differences in the two disorder
regimes, and advance the studies of disordered systems into actual consequences
of Anderson localization in light transport.

also look for spatial extension, which may be a hint for a DM origin according
to our N-body simulation studies of the subhalo population. In addition, we
used Gaia DR2 data to search for a potential stellar counterpart to our best DM

evaluating on two noisy speech corpora - Aurora-4 and AMI. We extend the octave

turns out that the potential of $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ state formed by $D\bar
D_1(2420)+\mathrm{c.c.}$ is attractive and strong enough to bind them together
when the momentum cutoff $\Lambda \gtrsim 1.4$ GeV. To produce the Y(4260) with
correct binding energy, we need $\Lambda\approx 2.1$ GeV. Besides, $D\bar
D_1(2420)+\mathrm{c.c.}$ can also form a state with exotic quantum numbers,
$J^{PC}=1^{-+}$, and its potential similar with that of the $J^{PC}=1^{--}$
state. Therefore, an exotic state with mass around 4240 MeV (called
$\eta_{c1}(4240)$) is predicted to exist. Our estimation of the mass of the
$J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ state in charmonium region is in agreement with those predicted
by the chiral quark model and the lattice QCD. The possible decay modes and
their relative widths are estimated and the results suggest that this exotic

with the dynamics of topological defects being particularly important to
intrinsically out-of-equilibrium, active materials. In this paper, local
manipulation of the ordering, dynamics, and topological properties of
microtubule-based extensile active nematic films is demonstrated in a joint
experimental and simulation study. Hydrodynamic stresses created by
magnetically actuated rotation of disk-shaped colloids in proximity to the
films compete with internal stresses in the active nematic, enabling local
control of the motion of the +1/2 charge topological defects that are intrinsic
to spontaneously turbulent active films. Sufficiently large applied stresses
drive the formation of +1 charge topological vortices in the director field
through the merger of two +1/2 defects. The directed motion of the defects is
accompanied by ordering of the vorticity and velocity of the active flows
within the film that is qualitatively unlike the response of passive viscous
films. Many features of the film's response to the disk are captured by Lattice
Boltzmann simulations, leading to insight into the anomalous viscoelastic
nature of the active nematic. The topological vortex formation is accompanied
by a rheological instability in the film that leads to significant increase in
the flow velocities. Comparison of the velocity profile in vicinity of the
vortex with fluid-dynamics calculations provides an estimate of film viscosity.

Multiple-Input Multiple-Output MIMO communication applications, including

of antennas ($M\gg 1$) employed in the base station and hence, a high signal
dimension. In this case, the number of pilot transmissions $N$ becomes
comparable to the number of antennas and standard estimators, such as the
sample covariance, yield a poor estimate of the true covariance and are
undesirable. In this paper, we propose a Maximum-Likelihood (ML) massive MIMO
covariance estimator, based on a parametric representation of the channel
angular spread function (ASF). The parametric representation emerges from
super-resolving discrete ASF components via the well-known MUltiple SIgnal
Classification (MUSIC) method plus approximating its continuous component using
suitable limited-support density function. We maximize the likelihood function

fair-efficient reward that each agent learns its own policy to optimize. To
avoid multi-objective conflict, we design a hierarchy consisting of a

fair-efficient reward by switching among the sub-policies that provides diverse
behaviors to interact with the environment. FEN can be trained in a fully

systems. However, the qubit connectivity of noisy intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ) devices is constrained by their {limited connectivity architecture}. To
improve the performance of CNOT circuits on NISQ devices, we investigate the
optimization of the size/depth of CNOT circuits under the limited connectivity
architecture. We present a method that can optimize the size of any $n$-qubit
CNOT circuit $O\left(\frac{n^2}{\log \delta}\right)$ on any connected graph
with minimum degree $\delta$, and prove this bound is optimal for the regular
graph. For the near-term sparsely connected structure, we additionally present
a method that can optimize the size of any $n$-qubit CNOT circuit to below
$2n^2$. The numerical experiment shows that our method performs better than
state-of-the-art results. Specifically, we present an example to illustrate the
applicability of our algorithm. For the grid structure, which is commonly used
in current quantum devices, we demonstrate that the depth of any $n$-qubit CNOT
circuit can be optimized to be linear in $n$ with certain ancillary qubits
(ancillas). Experimental results indicate that this method has significant
improvements compared with all of the existing methods. We additionally test
our algorithms on the five-qubit IBMQ devices, and the experiments show that
the measurement results of the optimized circuit with our algorithm are more
robust to noise compared with the IBM mapping method.

function from this Dedekind-finite set to some infinite ordinal $\kappa$. In
the case that we force the function to be injective, it turns out that the

This motivates the question if there is any combinatorial condition on a
Dedekind-finite set $A$ which characterises when a forcing will preserve its
Dedekind-finiteness or not add new sets of ordinals. We answer this question in

and incorporates additional rehearsal-based techniques to deal with
catastrophic forgetting. We demonstrate the efficacy of CURL in an unsupervised

to be very similar for $p$$+$Au and $^{3}$He$+$Au. However, for 0%--20% central

success of deep neural networks. Existing deep architectures are either
manually designed or automatically searched by some Neural Architecture Search
(NAS) methods. However, even a well-searched architecture may still contain
many non-significant or redundant modules or operations (e.g., convolution or
pooling), which may not only incur substantial memory consumption and
computation cost but also deteriorate the performance. Thus, it is necessary to
optimize the operations inside an architecture to improve the performance
without introducing extra computation cost. Unfortunately, such a constrained
optimization problem is NP-hard. To make the problem feasible, we cast the
optimization problem into a Markov decision process (MDP) and seek to learn a
Neural Architecture Transformer (NAT) to replace the redundant operations with
the more computationally efficient ones (e.g., skip connection or directly
removing the connection). Based on MDP, we learn NAT by exploiting
reinforcement learning to obtain the optimization policies w.r.t. different
architectures. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, we apply
NAT on both hand-crafted architectures and NAS based architectures. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, demonstrate
that the transformed architecture by NAT significantly outperforms both its
original form and those architectures optimized by existing methods.

unknown linear time-invariant systems with the tasks of optimizing a quadratic
cost while reducing the uncertainty. To this end, a synthesis problem is
defined where the feedback law has to simultaneously gain knowledge of the
system and robustly optimize the cost. By framing the problem in a finite
horizon setting, the trade-offs arising when the tasks include both
identification and control are formally captured in the optimization problem.
Results show that efficient exploration strategies are achieved when the

against the background of some fundamental principles from the field of
statistical pattern recognition, machine learning, or the recently so-called

neglect the contribution to the total uncertainty of performance assessment
from the finite training sample. Yet the latter is a fundamental indicator of
the stability of a classifier; thus its neglect may be contributing to the
problematic status of many studies. A three-level strategy is proposed for
moving forward in this field. The lowest level is that of construction, where
candidate features are selected and the choice of classifier architecture is
made. At that point, the effective dimensionality of the classifier is
estimated and used to size the next level of analysis, a pilot study on
previously unseen cases. The total (training and testing) uncertainty resulting
from the pilot study is, in turn, used to size the highest level of analysis, a
pivotal study with a target level of uncertainty. Some resources available in
the literature for implementing this approach are reviewed. Although the
concepts explained in the present article may be fundamental and
straightforward for many researchers in the machine learning community they are
subtle for many practitioners, for whom we provided a general advice for the
best practice in \cite{Shi2010MAQCII} and elaborate here in the present paper.

host-galaxy candidates of 16 short-GRBs from 2005 to 2015, corresponding to
roughly 1/3 of the presently known ensemble of well-localized short bursts.
Eight GRB fields were observed with ATCA (at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz), and eight fields
with the VLA (mostly at 5.5 GHz). The observations typically achieved a
1-sigma_rms of 5 to 8 microJy. In most cases they were performed years after
the corresponding burst. No new short-GRB host with optically obscured star
formation was found. Only one host galaxy was detected, the one of GRB 100206A
at z=0.407. However, its starburst nature was already known from optical/IR
data. Its measured radio flux can be interpreted as being due to a star
formation rate (SFR) of about 60 M_sol/yr. This is in good agreement with
earlier expectations based on the observed broad-band spectral energy
distribution of this galaxy. The 15 non-detections constrain the SFRs of the
suspected host galaxies and provide upper limits on late-time luminosities of
the associated radio afterglows and predicted kilonova radio flares. The
non-detection of radio emission from GRB explosion sites confirms the
intrinsically low luminosity of short-GRB afterglows and places significant
constraints on the parameter space of magnetar-powered radio flares. Luminous
radio flares from fiducial massive magnetars have not been found.

  Market: A Perspective from Market Participants","51st North American Power Symposium, October 2019",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A competitive wholesale electricity market consists of thousands of
interacting market participants. Driven by the variations of fuel costs, system
loads and weathers, these market participants compete actively and behave
variously in the power market. Although electricity markets tend to become more
transparent, a large amount of market information is still not publicly
available to market participants. Hence, data-driven analysis based on public
data is crucial for market participants to better understand and model
large-scale power markets, and ultimately to perform better in power trading.
While most of the previous researches related to the large-scale power markets
are based on the synthetic networks, a data-driven approach utilizing the real
power market data is proposed in this paper. First, the power plants' monthly
net generation and capacity data are obtained from U.S. Energy Information
Administration (EIA) and aggregated to figure out the monthly regional capacity
factors which are used to characterize the market's regional behaviors for
market participants. Then, the regional capacity factors are analyzed against
the metered system loads and natural gas prices to study the generation
behaviors in the power market. The analysis reveals the impacts of regional
natural gas prices on capacity factors and the responses of generating
behaviors to the system loads. The analysis results present the solid evidence
and rational references for market participants to model and validate the
large-scale power market in the future.

This article raises another kind of question: how to define the entropy of the
atmosphere itself, which is composed of variable proportions of dry air
(nitrogen, oxygen, argon, etc.) and water (vapour, liquid, ice). The specific
values of the entropy for such a variable composition system depend on the
reference values of its components. Most of the current definitions are based
on entropies set at zero for dry air and liquid water at zero degrees Celsius.
Differently, the third law of thermodynamics assumes that the entropy of all
species cancels out for the more stable solid state at the zero of absolute
temperatures. In this paper, we analyze the possible consequences of this
absolute definition of entropy of moist air on the calculation of entropy
fluxes. The impacts of moisture are significant and these new calculation
methods seem to be able to modify the budgets of atmospheric entropy, with
possible impacts on the nature of the equilibrium of the atmosphere resulting
from entropic imbalances induced by radiations.

Gaussian-masked Directional (GD) Transformer, and a biaffine attention scorer.
With the effective encoder design, our model only needs to take unigram

the shear wave speed of the host medium. We study the effect of this supershear

one-dimensional nonlinear shallow-water wave model accounting for both
time-dependent bathymetric displacement and velocity. With the local
bathymetric profile of Palu bay around a tidal station, our simulations
reproduce the tsunami arrival and motions observed by CCTV cameras. We conclude
that Mach (shock) fronts, generated by the supershear speed, interacted with
the bathymetry and contributed to the tsunami.

approach leverages the lexical information defined in FrameNet to associate
marked predicates or targets with semantic frames, thereby assigning semantic
roles to sentence components based on pre-specified frame elements in FrameNet.
In this paper, a deep neural network architecture known as Positional
Attention-based Frame Identification with BERT (PAFIBERT) is presented as a
solution to the frame identification subtask in frame-semantic parsing.
Although the importance of this subtask is well-established, prior research has
yet to find a robust solution that works satisfactorily for both in-domain and
out-of-domain data. This study thus set out to improve frame identification in
light of recent advancements of language modeling and transfer learning in
natural language processing. The proposed method is partially empowered by
BERT, a pre-trained language model that excels at capturing contextual
information in texts. By combining the language representation power of BERT
with a position-based attention mechanism, PAFIBERT is able to attend to
target-specific contexts in sentences for disambiguating targets and
associating them with the most suitable semantic frames. Under various
experimental settings, PAFIBERT outperformed existing solutions by a
significant margin, achieving new state-of-the-art results for both in-domain

surveillance applications, such as localization and spatio-temporal recognition
of persons. In real-world applications, an object detector and tracker must
interact on a periodic basis to discover new objects, and thereby to initiate
tracks. Periodic interactions with the detector can also allow the tracker to
validate and/or update its object template with new bounding boxes. However,
bounding boxes provided by a state-of-the-art detector are noisy, due to
changes in appearance, background and occlusion, which can cause the tracker to
drift. Moreover, CNN-based detectors can provide a high level of accuracy at
the expense of computational complexity, so interactions should be minimized
for real-time applications.
  In this paper, a new approach is proposed to manage detector-tracker
interactions for trackers from the Siamese-FC family. By integrating a change
detection mechanism into a deep Siamese-FC tracker, its template can be adapted
in response to changes in a target's appearance that lead to drifts during
tracking. An abrupt change detection triggers an update of tracker template
using the bounding box produced by the detector, while in the case of a gradual
change, the detector is used to update an evolving set of templates for robust
matching.
  Experiments were performed using state-of-the-art Siamese-FC trackers and the
YOLOv3 detector on a subset of videos from the OTB-100 dataset that mimic video
surveillance scenarios. Results highlight the importance for reliable VOT of
using accurate detectors. They also indicate that our adaptive Siamese trackers
are robust to noisy object detections, and can significantly improve the
performance of Siamese-FC tracking.

conditions flightless juveniles may aggregate into coherent, aligned swarms
referred to as hopper bands. These bands are often observed as a propagating
wave having a dense front with rapidly decreasing density in the wake. A
tantalizing and common observation is that these fronts slow and steepen in the
presence of green vegetation. This suggests the collective motion of the band
is mediated by resource consumption. Our goal is to model and quantify this
effect. We focus on the Australian plague locust, for which excellent field and
experimental data is available. Exploiting the alignment of locusts in hopper
bands, we concentrate solely on the density variation perpendicular to the
front. We develop two models in tandem; an agent-based model that tracks the
position of individuals and a partial differential equation model that
describes locust density. In both these models, locust are either stationary
(and feeding) or moving. Resources decrease with feeding. The rate at which
locusts transition between moving and stationary (and vice versa) is enhanced
(diminished) by resource abundance. This effect proves essential to the
formation, shape, and speed of locust hopper bands in our models. From the
biological literature we estimate ranges for the ten input parameters of our
models. Sobol sensitivity analysis yields insight into how the band's
collective characteristics vary with changes in the input parameters. By
examining 4.4 million parameter combinations, we identify biologically
consistent parameters that reproduce field observations. We thus demonstrate
that resource-dependent behavior can explain the density distribution observed
in locust hopper bands. This work suggests that feeding behaviors should be an
intrinsic part of future modeling efforts.

by means of molecular dynamics simulations and transition state theory. The
activation energy barrier in the absence of thermal energy was determined
through the nudged elastic band method while the cross-slip rates were
determined using molecular dynamics simulations for different magnitudes of the
Schmid stress on the cross-slip plane, and of the Escaig stresses on the
cross-slip and glide planes. The enthalpy barrier and the effective attempt
frequency were determined from the average rates of cross-slip obtained from
the molecular dynamics simulations. It was found that the different stress
states influence the cross-slip rate assuming harmonic transition state theory.
Moreover, the theoretical contributions to the enthalpy barrier
(configurational and due to the interaction of the applied stress with the
local stress field created by the defect) were identified from the atomistic
simulations while the entropic contribution to the activation energy could be
estimated by the Meyer-Neldel rule. Based on these results, an analytical
expression of the activation enthalpy for cross-slip in Al as a function of the
different combinations of Schmid and Escaig stress states was developed and
validated. This expression can be easily used in dislocation dynamics
simulations to evaluate the probability of cross-slip of screw dislocation
segments.

(GP) models for handling sequential input-output observations. Our approach
extends the existing prior-posterior recursion of online Bayesian inference,
i.e.\ past posterior discoveries become future prior beliefs, to the infinite
functional space setting of GP. For a reason of scalability, we introduce
variational inference together with an sparse approximation based on inducing
inputs. As a consequence, we obtain tractable continual lower-bounds where two
novel Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences intervene in a natural way. The key
technical property of our method is the recursive reconstruction of conditional
GP priors conditioned on the variational parameters learned so far. To achieve
this goal, we introduce a novel factorization of past variational
distributions, where the predictive GP equation propagates the posterior
uncertainty forward. We then demonstrate that it is possible to derive GP
models over many types of sequential observations, either discrete or
continuous and amenable to stochastic optimization. The continual inference
approach is also applicable to scenarios where potential multi-channel or
heterogeneous observations might appear. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the method is fully scalable, shows a reliable performance and is robust to

both motivation and a framework for interdisciplinary research towards the
development of special purpose digital and analog quantum simulators, and
ultimately of scalable universal quantum computers. In this manuscript, recent
results and new tools from a quantum science approach to study lattice gauge

tensor network methods are presented - a classical simulation approach -
applied to the study of lattice gauge theories together with some results on

operations assisted by classical communication (LOCC) is a crucial problem in
quantum information theory for both theoretical and practical reasons. As LOCC
has a highly intricate structure, sometimes the larger set of separable (SEP)
maps is considered, which has a mathematically much simpler description. In the
literature, mainly SEP maps consisting of invertible Kraus operators have been
taken into account. In this paper we show that the consideration of those maps
is not sufficient when deciding whether a state can be mapped to another via
general SEP transformations. This is done by providing explicit examples of
transformations among pure 3- and 5- qubits states, which are feasible via SEP
maps containing singular Kraus operators, however, not possible via SEP maps
containing solely regular Kraus operators. The key point that allows to
construct the SEP maps is to introduce projective measurements that occur with
probability zero on the input state. The fact that it is not sufficient to
consider SEP maps composed out of regular Kraus operators even in the case of
pure state transformations, also affects the results on LOCC transformations
among pure states. However, we show that non-invertible Kraus operators do not
help in state transformations under LOCC with finitely many rounds of classical
communication, i.e. the necessary and sufficient condition for SEP
transformations with invertible Kraus operators is still a necessary condition
for convertibility under finite-round LOCC. Moreover, we show that the results
on transformations via SEP that are not possible with LOCC (including
infinitely many rounds of classical communication) presented in M. Hebenstreit,

experiencing highly variable net-load flows and even reverse flows. To optimize
distribution systems under such conditions, the scheduling of mechanical
devices, such as OLTCs and capacitor banks, needs to take into account
forecasted solar PV and actual grid conditions. However, these legacy switching
assets are operated on a daily or hourly timescale, due to the wear and tear
associated with mechanical switching, which makes them unsuitable for real-time
control. Therefore, there is a natural timescale-separation between these
slower mechanical assets and the responsive nature of inverter-based resources.
In this paper, we present a network admissible convex formulation for
holistically scheduling controllable grid assets to position voltage optimally
against solarPV. An optimal hourly schedule is presented that utilizes
mechanical resources to position the predicted voltages close to nominal
values, while minimizing the use of inverter-based resources (i.e.,
DERs),making them available for control at a faster time-scale (after the
uncertainty reveals itself). A convex, inner approximation of the OPF problem
is adapted to a mixed-integer linear program that minimizes voltage deviations
from nominal (i.e., maximizes voltage margins). The resulting OPF solution
respects all the network constraints and is, hence, robust against modeling
simplifications. Simulation based analysis on IEEE distribution feeders
validates the approach.

deeper into Newtonian mechanics, we identify complications that result from
considering vehicle status, road geometry and environmental parameters. An

operations on these nonequilibrium Green's functions, for constructing Feynman

involving contour Green's functions. The library employs a discretization of
the Kadanoff-Baym contour into time $N$ points and a high-order implementation
of integration routines. The total integrated error scales up to
$\mathcal{O}(N^{-7})$, which is important since the numerical effort increases
at least cubically with the simulation time. A distributed-memory
parallelization over reciprocal space allows large-scale simulations of lattice
systems. We provide a collection of example programs ranging from dynamics in
simple two-level systems to problems relevant in contemporary condensed matter

atmospheric spectra remain vulnerable to false positives, false negatives, and
missassignments. There is a key need for spectral data for a broad range of

consumers with local flexibility (generation, loads, storage) and where access
to data is a key requirement in the value stream. However, legislation on
personal data privacy and protection imposes the need to develop local models
for flexibility modeling and forecasting and exchange models instead of
personal data. This paper describes the functional architecture of an home
energy management system (HEMS) and its optimization functions. A set of
data-driven models, embedded in the HEMS, are discussed for improving renewable
energy forecasting skill and modeling multi-period flexibility of distributed
energy resources.

collaborative work not written solely by William Shakespeare. We employ
combined analysis of vocabulary and versification together with machine
learning techniques to determine which authors also took part in the writing of
the play and what were their relative contributions. Unlike most previous
studies, we go beyond the attribution of particular scenes and use the rolling
attribution approach to determine the probabilities of authorship of pieces of
texts, without respecting the scene boundaries. Our results highly support the
canonical division of the play between William Shakespeare and John Fletcher
proposed by James Spedding, but also bring new evidence supporting the
modifications proposed later by Thomas Merriam.

where different agents try to achieve their set of goals and have to decide on
what to do based on their local perception. We distinguish several types of
conflicts for this setting. In order to enable modelling of conflict situations
and the reasons for conflicts, we present a logical framework that adopts
concepts from epistemic and modal logic, justification and temporal logic.
Using this framework, we illustrate how conflicts can be identified and how we
derive a chain of justifications leading to this conflict. We discuss how
conflict resolution can be done when a vehicle has local, incomplete
information, vehicle to vehicle communication (V2V) and partially ordered
goals.

publish/subscribe pattern in which multiple clients connect to a single broker,
generally hosted in the cloud. However, such a centralised approach does not
scale well considering the massive numbers of IoT devices forecasted in the
next future, thus calling for distributed solutions in which multiple brokers
cooperate together. Indeed, distributed brokers can be moved from traditional
cloud-based infrastructure to the edge of the network (as it is envisioned by
the upcoming MEC technology of 5G cellular networks), with clear improvements
in terms of latency, for example. This paper proposes MQTT-ST, a protocol able
to create such a distributed architecture of brokers, organized through a
spanning tree. The protocol uses in-band signalling (i.e., reuses MQTT
primitives for the control messages) and allows for full message replication
among brokers, as well as robustness against failures. We tested MQTT-ST in
different experimental scenarios and we released it as open-source project to
allow for reproducible research.

  demo site is added under Figure-12",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using generative models for Inverse Graphics is an active area of research.
However, most works focus on developing models for supervised and
semi-supervised methods. In this paper, we study the problem of unsupervised
learning of 3D geometry from single images. Our approach is to use a generative
model that produces 2-D images as projections of a latent 3D voxel grid, which
we train either as a variational auto-encoder or using adversarial methods. Our
contributions are as follows: First, we show how to recover 3D shape and pose
from general datasets such as MNIST, and MNIST Fashion in good quality. Second,
we compare the shapes learned using adversarial and variational methods.
Adversarial approach gives denser 3D shapes. Third, we explore the idea of
modelling the pose of an object as uniform distribution to recover 3D shape
from a single image. Our experiment with the CelebA dataset
\cite{liu2015faceattributes} proves that we can recover complete 3D shape from
a single image when the object is symmetric along one, or more axis whilst
results obtained using ModelNet40 \cite{wu20153d} show the potential
side-effects, in which the model learns 3D shapes such that it can render the
same image from any viewpoint. Forth, we present a general end-to-end approach
to learning 3D shapes from single images in a completely unsupervised fashion
by modelling the factors of variation such as azimuth as independent latent
variables. Our method makes no assumptions about the dataset, and can work with
synthetic as well as real images (i.e. unsupervised in true sense). We present
our results, by training the model using the $\mu$-VAE objective
\cite{ucar2019bridging} and a dataset combining all images from MNIST, MNIST
Fashion, CelebA and six categories of ModelNet40. The model is able to learn 3D
shapes and the pose in qood quality and leverages information learned across
all datasets.

complex cascades of optical elements on a plane. We leverage the benefits of
such a surface to develop a planar integrated photonic beam collimator for
on-chip optofluidic sensing applications. While most of the current work
focuses on miniaturizing the optical ""detection"" hardware, little attention is
given to develop on-chip hardware for optical ""excitation"". In this manuscript,
we propose a flat metasurface for beam collimation in optofluidic applications.
We implement an inverse design approach to optimize the metasurface using
gradient descent method and experimentally compare its characteristics with
conventional binary grating-based photonic beam diffractors. The proposed
metasurface can enhance the illumination efficiency almost two times in on-chip
applications such as fluorescence imaging, Raman and IR spectroscopy and can
enable multiplexing of light sources for high throughput biosensing.

  Big Bang: HeH2+ as the Precursor for HeH+","25 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the early universe, following the nucleosynthesis, conditions were right
for recombination processes to take place yielding neutral atoms H, He and Li.
The understanding so far in astrophysics is that the first molecule to be
formed was HeH+ by radiative association (He + H+ -> HeH+ + h(nu) and He+ + H
-> HeH+ + h(nu). The recent report by Guesten et al (Nature, 568, 357, 2019) of
detection of HeH+ in planetary Nebula NGC 7027 confirms its presence, but it
does not conclusively prove the origin of this species. To create molecules
from free moving quasi-ions surrounded by an electronic cloud, the
Born-Oppenheimer-Huang (BOH) theory furnishes two kinds of forces, namely, one
that results from the Potential Energy Surfaces (PESs) and the other from
Non-Adiabatic Coupling Terms (NACTs). Whereas the PESs are known to manage slow
moving quasi-ions the NACTs, with their, frequently, infinitely large values at
the vicinity of the singularities can control the fast moving quasi-ions. To
achieve that the BOH equation indicates that the NACTs are affecting the fast
moving quasi-ions directly and if they are attributed with dissipative features
or in other words to behave as a Friction Force they indeed could serve (like
any other ordinary friction) as moderators for the fast atomic(ionic) species.
It is proposed in the present paper that the triatomic HeH2+ was the precursor
to HeH+ and it could have been formed by the (He, H, H)+ nuclei coming together
under the electron cloud, facilitated by the NACTs between different electronic
states acting as an astronomical friction force. This is possible because of
the singularities in the NACTs for triatomic systems and NOT for diatomic
systems. Although the existence of HeH2+ was established in the laboratory in
1996, it has not been detected in the interstellar media so far. But, there is
no reason why it cannot be detected in near future.
