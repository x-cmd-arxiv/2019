fundamental point to understand both SN dynamics and neutrino physical
properties. JUNO is a 20kton liquid scintillator detector, under construction
in Jiangmen, China. The main aim of the experiment is to determine neutrino
mass hierarchy by precisely measuring the energy spectrum of reactor electron
antineutrinos. However due to its properties, JUNO has the capability of
detecting a high statistics of SN events too. Existing data from SN neutrino
consists only of 24 events coming from the SN 1987A,the detection of a SN burst
in JUNO at $\sim 10 kpc$ will yield $\sim 5 x 10^{3}$ inverse beta decay (IBD)
events from electron antineutrinos, about 1500 from proton elastic scattering
(pES) above the threshold of 0.2 MeV, about 400 from electron elastic
scattering (eES), plus several hundreds on other CC and NC interaction channels
from all neutrino species.

123 is a little-studied, nearby and very sparse open cluster. We performed the
first high-resolution spectroscopic study of this cluster in the framework of
the SPA (Stellar Population Astrophysics) project with GIARPS at the TNG. We
observed 17 stars, five of which turned out to be double-lined binaries. Three
of the investigated sources were rejected as members on the basis of astrometry
and lithium content. For the remaining single stars we derived the stellar
parameters, extinction, radial and projected rotational velocities, and
chemical abundances for 21 species with atomic number up to 40. From the
analysis of single main-sequence stars we found an average extinction
$A_V\simeq 0.13$ mag and a median radial velocity of about $-5.6$ km/s. The
average metallicity we found for ASCC 123 is [Fe/H]$\simeq+0.14\pm 0.04$, which
is in line with that expected for its Galactocentric distance. The chemical
composition is compatible with the Galactic trends in the solar neighborhood
within the errors. From the lithium abundance and chromospheric H$\alpha$
emission we found an age similar to that of the Pleiades, which agrees with
that inferred from the Hertzsprung-Russell and color-magnitude diagrams.

We do this by showing that, starting from a background with no NSNS-flux, the
deformed background solves the $\alpha'$-corrected supergravity equations to
second order in the deformation parameter. At the same time we determine the
required $\alpha'$-corrections of the deformed background, which take a
relatively simple form. In examples that can be constructed using, possibly
non-commuting sequences of, TsT transformations we show how to obtain the first
$\alpha'$-correction to all orders in the deformation parameter by making use
of the $\alpha'$-corrected T-duality rules. We demonstrate this on the specific

includes feasibility sets that are compact. Bounds are expressed in terms of
the cumulative error and the path length of the optimal solutions. This
suggests how to allocate resources to strike a balance between performance and

of data related to long-term traffic history, payload attribution systems (PAS)
based on storing a compact digest of traffic using Bloom filters have been
presented in the literature. In these systems, querying the stored digest for
an excerpt results in a low number of suspects instead of certain criminals. In
this paper, we present a different PAS which is based on simple and widespread

inspired by DSP-based compression algorithms. The proposed payload attribution
system, named DSPAS, not only results in a low false positive rate but also
outperforms previous schemes in response to wildcard queries which are
essentially applicable for complex excerpts such as the signature of
polymorphic worms. Our theoretical analysis and practical evaluations show that
DSPAS results in a significantly lower false positive rate and also a lower

which is concerned with the analysis and prediction of equipment health and
performance. One of the key challenges in PHM is to accurately predict
impending failures in the equipment. In recent years, solutions for failure
prediction have evolved from building complex physical models to the use of
machine learning algorithms that leverage the data generated by the equipment.
However, failure prediction problems pose a set of unique challenges that make
direct application of traditional classification and prediction algorithms
impractical. These challenges include the highly imbalanced training data, the
extremely high cost of collecting more failure samples, and the complexity of
the failure patterns. Traditional oversampling techniques will not be able to
capture such complexity and accordingly result in overfitting the training
data. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel algorithm for
failure prediction using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN-FP). GAN-FP first
utilizes two GAN networks to simultaneously generate training samples and build
an inference network that can be used to predict failures for new samples.
GAN-FP first adopts an infoGAN to generate realistic failure and non-failure
samples, and initialize the weights of the first few layers of the inference
network. The inference network is then tuned by optimizing a weighted loss
objective using only real failure and non-failure samples. The inference
network is further tuned using a second GAN whose purpose is to guarantee the
consistency between the generated samples and corresponding labels. GAN-FP can
be used for other imbalanced classification problems as well.

on-time delivery and minimum past-due and inventory cost. Manufacturing,
especially in the developed world, is moving towards on-demand manufacturing
meaning a high mix, low volume product mix. This requires efficient dispatching
that can work in dynamic and stochastic environments, meaning it allows for
quick response to new orders received and can work over a disparate set of shop
floor settings. In this paper we address this problem of dispatching in
manufacturing. Using reinforcement learning (RL), we propose a new design to
formulate the shop floor state as a 2-D matrix, incorporate job slack time into
state representation, and design lateness and tardiness rewards function for
dispatching purpose. However, maintaining a separate RL model for each
production line on a manufacturing shop floor is costly and often infeasible.
To address this, we enhance our deep RL model with an approach for dispatching
policy transfer. This increases policy generalization and saves time and cost
for model training and data collection. Experiments show that: (1) our approach
performs the best in terms of total discounted reward and average lateness,
tardiness, (2) the proposed policy transfer approach reduces training time and
increases policy generalization.

luminosity of $1.2\times10^{28}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This luminosity, considered with
the recent 6 GHz detection of PTF10hgi in Eftekhari et al (2019), supports the
interpretation that it is powered by a young, fast-spinning ($\sim$ ms spin
period) magnetar with $\sim$ 15 Msun of partially ionized ejecta. Broadly, our
observations are most consistent with SLSNe-I being powered by neutron stars
with fast spin periods, although most require more free-free absorption than is
inferred for PTF10hgi. We predict that radio observations at higher frequencies
or in the near future will detect these systems and begin constraining
properties of the young pulsars and their birth environments.

interpolation (PWDI) method to the electric field integral equation (EFIE)
formulation of problems of scattering and radiation by perfect electric
conducting (PEC) objects. Relying on Kirchhoff integral formula and local
interpolation of surface current densities that regularize the kernel
singularities, the PWDI method enables off- and on-surface EFIE operators to be
re-expressed in terms of integrands that are globally bounded (or even more
regular) over the whole domain of integration, regardless of the magnitude of
the distance between target and source points. Surface integrals resulting from
the application of the method-of-moments (MoM) using Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG)
basis functions, can then be directly and easily evaluated by means of
elementary quadrature rules irrespective of the singularity location. The
proposed technique can be applied to simple and composite surfaces comprising
two or more simply-connected overlapping components. The use of composite
surfaces can significantly simplify the geometric treatment of complex
structures, as the PWDI method enables the use of separate non-conformal meshes
for the discretization of each of the surface components that make up the
composite surface. A variety of examples, including multi-scale and intricate
structures, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

that it is difficult to determine when the output of a causal discovery method

emitters, defect-phonon coupling in hBN governs the characteristic
single-photon emission and provides an opportunity to investigate the atomic
and electronic structure of emitters as well as the coupling of their spin- and
charge-dependent electronic states to phonons. Here, we investigate these
questions using photoluminescence excitation (PLE) experiments at T=4K on
single photon emitters in multilayer hBN grown by chemical vapor deposition. By
scanning up to 250 meV from the zero phonon line (ZPL), we can precisely
measure the emitter's coupling efficiency to different phonon modes. Our
results show that excitation mediated by the absorption of one in-plane optical
phonon increases the emitter absorption probability ten-fold compared to that
mediated by acoustic or out-of-plane optical phonons. We compare these
measurements against theoretical predictions by first-principles
density-functional theory of four defect candidates, for which we calculate
prevalent charge states and their spin-dependent coupling to bulk and local

study has been central to the theory of graph visualization since its
introduction in 1995 [Qing-Wen Feng, Robert F. Cohen, and Peter Eades.
Planarity for clustered graphs. ESA'95], has only been recently settled
[Radoslav Fulek and Csaba D. T\'oth. Atomic Embeddability, Clustered Planarity,
and Thickenability. To appear at SODA'20]. Before such a breakthrough, the
complexity question was still unsolved even when the graph has a prescribed
planar embedding, i.e, for embedded clustered graphs.
  We show that the C-Planarity Testing problem admits a single-exponential
single-parameter FPT algorithm for embedded clustered graphs, when
parameterized by the carving-width of the dual graph of the input. This is the
first FPT algorithm for this long-standing open problem with respect to a
single notable graph-width parameter. Moreover, in the general case, the
polynomial dependency of our FPT algorithm is smaller than the one of the
algorithm by Fulek and T\'oth. To further strengthen the relevance of this
result, we show that the C-Planarity Testing problem retains its computational
complexity when parameterized by several other graph-width parameters, which
may potentially lead to faster algorithms.

existing transaction systems based on an external central authority for
security. Although Bitcoin has many desirable properties, one of its
fundamental shortcomings is its inability to process transactions at high
rates. To address this challenge, many subsequent protocols either modify the
rules of block acceptance (longest chain rule) and reward, or alter the
graphical structure of the public ledger from a tree to a directed acyclic
graph (DAG). Motivated by these approaches, we introduce a new general
framework that captures ledger growth for a large class of DAG-based
implementations. With this in hand, and by assuming honest miner behaviour, we
(experimentally) explore how different DAG-based protocols perform in terms of
fairness, i.e., if the block reward of a miner is proportional to their hash
power, as well as efficiency, i.e. what proportion of user transactions a
ledger deems valid after a certain length of time. Our results demonstrate
fundamental structural limits on how well DAG-based ledger protocols cope with
a high transaction load. More specifically, we show that even in a scenario
where every miner on the system is honest in terms of when they publish blocks,
what they point to, and what transactions each block contains, fairness and
efficiency of the ledger can break down at specific hash rates if miners have
differing levels of connectivity to the P2P network sustaining the protocol.

express pose changes as a deformation of a layered 2.5D template mesh, and
devise a novel architecture that learns to predict mesh deformations matching
the template to a target image. This enables us to extract a common
low-dimensional structure from a diverse set of character poses. We combine
recent advances in differentiable rendering as well as mesh-aware models to
successfully align common template even if only a few character images are
available during training. In addition to coarse poses, character appearance
also varies due to shading, out-of-plane motions, and artistic effects. We
capture these subtle changes by applying an image translation network to refine
the mesh rendering, providing an end-to-end model to generate new animations of
a character with high visual quality. We demonstrate that our generative model
can be used to synthesize in-between frames and to create data-driven

measurements, certain combinations of visibilities called closure phases and
closure amplitudes are independent of antenna gains and provide a convenient
set of robust observables. However, these closure quantities have subtle noise
properties and are generally both linearly and statistically dependent. These
complications have obstructed the proper use of closure quantities in
interferometric analysis, and they have obscured the relationship between
analysis with closure quantities and other analysis techniques such as self
calibration. We review the statistics of closure quantities, noting common
pitfalls that arise when approaching low signal-to-noise due to the nonlinear
propagation of statistical errors. We then develop a strategy for isolating and
fitting to the independent degrees of freedom captured by the closure

First, we show that two prevalent perspectives on explanations ---
feature-additivity and feature-selection --- lead to fundamentally different
instance-wise explanations. In the literature, explainers from different
perspectives are currently being directly compared, despite their distinct
explanation goals. The second issue is that current post-hoc explainers are
either validated under simplistic scenarios (on simple models such as linear
regression, or on models trained on syntactic datasets), or, when applied to
real-world neural networks, explainers are commonly validated under the
assumption that the learned models behave reasonably. However, neural networks
often rely on unreasonable correlations, even when producing correct decisions.
We introduce a verification framework for explanatory methods under the
feature-selection perspective. Our framework is based on a non-trivial neural
network architecture trained on a real-world task, and for which we are able to
provide guarantees on its inner workings. We validate the efficacy of our
evaluation by showing the failure modes of current explainers. We aim for this
framework to provide a publicly available, off-the-shelf evaluation when the

Higher Order Functions (HOF) to represent the shape of the object. We present a
new generalization of this method to incorporate multiple images as input and
establish a connection between visibility and reconstruction quality. This
relationship forms the foundation of our view planning method where we compute
viewpoints to visually cover the output of the multi-view HOF network with as
few images as possible. Experiments indicate that our method provides a good
compromise between online and offline methods: Similar to online methods, our
method does not require the true object model as input. In terms of number of
views, it is much more efficient. In most cases, its performance is comparable
to the optimal offline case even on object classes the network has not been

environments (e.g. industrial robots or power grids) are generally designed
with safety constraints in mind implemented in the shape of valid actions masks

the motors of a robot can be limited to physical boundaries. Violating
constraints thus results in rejected actions or entering in a safe mode driven
by an external controller, making RL agents incapable of learning from their
mistakes. In this paper, we propose a simple modification of a state-of-the-art
deep RL algorithm (DQN), enabling learning from forbidden actions. To do so,
the standard Q-learning update is enhanced with an extra safety loss inspired
by structured classification. We empirically show that it reduces the number of

near-optimal policies compared to using standard DQN. Experiments are done on a

centers, including those in the Milky Way and M31, host a supermassive black
hole (SMBH) embedded in a triaxial nuclear star cluster. In this work, we study
the secular orbital evolution of binaries in these environments, and
characterize the regions and morphological properties of nuclear star clusters
that lead to gravitational wave mergers and/or tidal captures. We show that
even a modest level of triaxiality in the density distribution of a cluster (an
ellipsoid with axis ratios of 0.7 and 0.95) dramatically enhances the merger
rates in the central parsecs of the Galaxy by a factor of up to ~10-30 relative
to a spherical density distribution. Moreover, we show that the merger fraction
of binaries with semi-major axes in the range 10-100 AU remains above 10% for
the entire central parsec of the cluster, reaching values close to unity at a
distance of ~0.2-0.4 pc from the SMBH. We understand this large merger
efficiency in terms of two distinct mechanisms: i) eccentricity oscillations
driven by the dominant axisymmetric part of the cluster potential that are
enhanced by the slow modulation of a binary's angular momentum from the
triaxial contribution, similar to the well-known octupole-level dynamics in
three-body systems; ii) chaotic diffusion of eccentricities arising when the
nodal precession timescale of a binary's orbit about the SMBH becomes
comparable to its characteristic secular timescale. Overall, our results
indicate that galactic centers are significantly more collisional than
previously thought, with mergers taking place up to the effective radii of
their nuclear star clusters.

In the impulse and local approximations the coefficients are computed
analytically from the number density, mass, size and relative velocity of
substructures without arbitrary cuts in forces or impact parameters. The
resulting Coulomb logarithm attains a well-defined geometrical meaning,
$\ln(\Lambda)=\ln (D/c)$, where $D/c$ is the ratio between the average

point-like objects ($c/D\ll 10^{-3}$) induce a heavy-tailed, non-Gaussian
distribution of high-energy impulses that cannot be described with Brownian
statistics. In the point-mass limit ($c/D\approx 0$) the median Coulomb
logarithm measured from $N$-body models deviates from the theoretical relation,
converging towards a maximum value $\langle \ln(\Lambda)\rangle \approx 8.2$

should be monotonic with respect to allowed slack (i.e., maximum allowed
group-parity violation). Such monotonicity can be useful for individuals to
understand the impact of enforcing fairness on their predictions. Surprisingly,
we find that standard ML methods for enforcing fairness violate this basic

the complexity of the underlying model or approximate optimizations, suggesting
that the simple act of incorporating a constraint can lead to drastically

Multi-Arm Bandit (MAB) problem. Our setting consists of a large number of
agents $n$ that collaboratively and simultaneously solve the same instance of
$K$ armed MAB to minimize the average cumulative regret over all agents. The
agents can communicate and collaborate among each other \emph{only} through a
pairwise asynchronous gossip based protocol that exchange a limited number of
bits. In our model, agents at each point decide on (i) which arm to play, (ii)
whether to, and if so (iii) what and whom to communicate with. Agents in our
model are decentralized, namely their actions only depend on their observed
history in the past.
  We develop a novel algorithm in which agents, whenever they choose,
communicate only arm-ids and not samples, with another agent chosen uniformly
and independently at random. The per-agent regret scaling achieved by our
algorithm is $O \left( \frac{\lceil\frac{K}{n}\rceil+\log(n)}{\Delta}
  \log(T) + \frac{\log^3(n) \log \log(n)}{\Delta^2}
  \right)$. Furthermore, any agent in our algorithm communicates only a total
of $\Theta(\log(T))$ times over a time interval of $T$.
  We compare our results to two benchmarks - one where there is no
communication among agents and one corresponding to complete interaction. We
show both theoretically and empirically, that our algorithm experiences a
significant reduction both in per-agent regret when compared to the case when
agents do not collaborate and in communication complexity when compared to the
full interaction setting which requires $T$ communication attempts by an agent

assess the predictive capacity of a given combination is to consider the
center-adjusted AUC (aAUC), a summary of the ability of the combination to
discriminate between cases and controls in each center. Rather than using a
general method, such as logistic regression, to construct the biomarker
combination, we propose directly maximizing the aAUC. Furthermore, it may be
desirable to have a biomarker combination with similar performance across
centers. To that end, we allow for penalization of the variability in the
center-specific AUCs. We demonstrate desirable asymptotic properties of the
resulting combinations. Simulations provide small-sample evidence that
maximizing the aAUC can lead to combinations with improved performance. We also
use simulated data to illustrate the utility of constructing combinations by
maximizing the aAUC while penalizing variability. Finally, we apply these

population with socio-economic or infrastructural metrics (transversal
scaling), should we expect that each city would follow the same behavior over
time (longitudinal scaling)? This assumption has important policy implications,
although rigorous empirical tests have been so far hindered by the lack of
suitable data. Here, we advance the debate by looking into the temporal
evolution of the scaling laws for 5507 municipalities in Brazil. We focus on
the relationship between population size and two urban variables, GDP and water
network length, analyzing the time evolution of the system of cities as well as
their individual trajectory. We find that longitudinal (individual) scaling
exponents are city-specific, but they are distributed around an average value
that approaches to the transversal scaling exponent when the data are
decomposed to eliminate external factors, and when we only consider cities with
a sufficiently large growth rate. Such results give support to the idea that
the longitudinal dynamics is a micro-scaling version of the transversal
dynamics of the entire urban system. Finally, we propose a mathematical
framework that connects the microscopic level to global behavior, and, in all
analyzed cases, we find good agreement between theoretical prediction and
empirical evidence.

their inputs. We design, implement and evaluate a channel-based update
algorithm for the central server in a distributed system, which selects the

them as learned information from local datasets. A pruning process is applied
to the algorithm based on the validation set, which serves as a model

higher saturating speed than the Federated Averaging method which reveals all
the parameters of local models to the server when updating. We also demonstrate

which provides a platform for analyzing the posterior distribution and
naturally leads to an efficient numerical sampling algorithm. We highlight
that, the stability estimate is obtained by treating the potential functions as
intermediate variables in the following way: the discrepancy between two sets
of observation data of training observables can bound the distance between
corresponding posterior distributions of potential functions, while the latter
naturally leads to a bound of the discrepancies between corresponding thermal
averages of test observables. Besides, the training observables can be more
flexible than finite samples of the local density function, which are mostly
used in previous researches. The method also applies to the multi-level quantum
systems in the non-adiabatic regime. In addition, we provide extensive
numerical tests to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed
algorithm.

bear than single-machine learning, thus enabling reductions in training time.
Distributed learning partitions models and data over many machines, allowing
model and dataset sizes beyond the available compute power and memory of a
single machine. In practice though, distributed ML is challenging when
distribution is mandatory, rather than chosen by the practitioner. In such
scenarios, data could unavoidably be separated among workers due to limited
memory capacity per worker or even because of data privacy issues. There,
existing distributed methods will utterly fail due to dominant transfer costs
across workers, or do not even apply.
  We propose a new approach to distributed fully connected neural network
learning, called independent subnet training (IST), to handle these cases. In
IST, the original network is decomposed into a set of narrow subnetworks with
the same depth. These subnetworks are then trained locally before parameters
are exchanged to produce new subnets and the training cycle repeats. Such a
naturally ""model parallel"" approach limits memory usage by storing only a
portion of network parameters on each device. Additionally, no requirements
exist for sharing data between workers (i.e., subnet training is local and
independent) and communication volume and frequency are reduced by decomposing
the original network into independent subnets. These properties of IST can cope
with issues due to distributed data, slow interconnects, or limited device
memory, making IST a suitable approach for cases of mandatory distribution. We
show experimentally that IST results in training times that are much lower than
common distributed learning approaches.

This is done by observing the interaural phase difference obtained from the
time-frequency representation of binaural mixtures. Furthermore, a method is
proposed to model the interaural coherence of the signals. Including
information related to the sound multipath propagation, the performance of the

and the magnetic field properties of low-mass stars are fundamentally linked
making this a challenging task. Of particular interest is the stellar magnetic
field geometry. In this work, we consider whether non-dipolar field modes
contribute significantly to the spin-down of low-mass stars. We do this using a
sample of stars that have all been previously mapped with Zeeman-Doppler
imaging. For a given star, as long as its mass-loss rate is below some critical
mass-loss rate, only the dipolar fields contribute to its spin-down torque.
However, if it has a larger mass-loss rate, higher order modes need to be
considered. For each star, we calculate this critical mass-loss rate, which is
a simple function of the field geometry. Additionally, we use two methods of
estimating mass-loss rates for our sample of stars. In the majority of cases,
we find that the estimated mass-loss rates do not exceed the critical mass-loss
rate and hence, the dipolar magnetic field alone is sufficient to determine the
spin-down torque. However, we find some evidence that, at large Rossby numbers,
non-dipolar modes may start to contribute.

Audio/Video interfacing between video-enabled devices. Today, almost tens of
billions of HDMI devices exist worldwide and are widely used to distribute A/V
signals in smart homes, offices, concert halls, and sporting events making HDMI
one of the most highly deployed systems in the world. An important component in
HDMI is the Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) protocol, which allows for the
interaction between devices within an HDMI distribution network. Nonetheless,
existing network security mechanisms only protect traditional networking
components, leaving CEC outside of their scope. In this work, we identify and
tap into CEC protocol vulnerabilities, using them to implement realistic
proof-of-work attacks on HDMI distribution networks. We study, how current
insecure CEC protocol practices and HDMI distributions may grant an adversary a
novel attack surface for HDMI devices otherwise thought to be unreachable. To
introduce this novel attack surface, we present HDMI-Walk, which opens a realm
of remote and local CEC attacks to HDMI devices. Specifically, with HDMI-Walk,
an attacker can perform malicious analysis of devices, eavesdropping, Denial of
Service attacks, targeted device attacks, and even facilitate well-known
existing attacks through HDMI. With HDMI-Walk, we prove it is feasible for an
attacker to gain arbitrary control of HDMI devices. We demonstrate the
implementations of both local and remote attacks with commodity HDMI devices.
Finally, we discuss security mechanisms to provide impactful and comprehensive
security evaluation to these real-world systems while guaranteeing
deployability and providing minimal overhead considering the current
limitations of the CEC protocol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work solely investigating the security of HDMI device distribution
networks.

constitutive models have been successfully used in literature to capture the
material response. However, the translation of these models into computational
platforms remains limited. Many experimentally derived viscoelastic
constitutive models are not suitable for three-dimensional simulations.
Furthermore, the use of fractional derivatives can be computationally
prohibitive, with a number of current numerical approximations having a
computational cost that is $ \mathcal{O} ( N_T^2) $ and a storage cost that is
$ \mathcal{O}(N_T) $ ($ N_T $ denotes the number of time steps). In this paper,
we present a novel numerical approximation to the Caputo derivative which
exploits a recurrence relation similar to those used to discretize classic
temporal derivatives, giving a computational cost that is $ \mathcal{O} (N) $

numerical applications, and the error estimate is presented to demonstrate
efficacy of the method. The method is shown to be unconditionally stable in the
linear viscoelastic case. It was then integrated into a computational
biomechanical framework, with several numerical examples verifying accuracy and
computational efficiency of the method, including in an analytic test, in an

lower bound, no such clear measure exists for the compressibility of repetitive
sequences. Since statistical entropy does not capture repetitiveness, ad-hoc
measures like the size $z$ of the Lempel--Ziv parse are frequently used to
estimate it. The size $b \le z$ of the smallest bidirectional macro scheme
captures better what can be achieved via copy-paste processes, though it is
NP-complete to compute and it is not monotonic upon symbol appends. Recently, a
more principled measure, the size $\gamma$ of the smallest string
\emph{attractor}, was introduced. The measure $\gamma \le b$ lower bounds all
the previous relevant ones, yet length-$n$ strings can be represented and
efficiently indexed within space $O(\gamma\log\frac{n}{\gamma})$, which also
upper bounds most measures. While $\gamma$ is certainly a better measure of
repetitiveness than $b$, it is also NP-complete to compute and not monotonic,
and it is unknown if one can always represent a string in $o(\gamma\log n)$
space.
  In this paper, we study an even smaller measure, $\delta \le \gamma$, which
can be computed in linear time, is monotonic, and allows encoding every string
in $O(\delta\log\frac{n}{\delta})$ space because $z =
O(\delta\log\frac{n}{\delta})$. We show that $\delta$ better captures the
compressibility of repetitive strings. Concretely, we show that (1) $\delta$
can be strictly smaller than $\gamma$, by up to a logarithmic factor; (2) there
are string families needing $\Omega(\delta\log\frac{n}{\delta})$ space to be
encoded, so this space is optimal for every $n$ and $\delta$; (3) one can build
run-length context-free grammars of size $O(\delta\log\frac{n}{\delta})$,

performance model that approximates the cost of each. The RDMA operations have
direct hardware support in the network and therefore lower latency and
overhead, while the RPC operations are more expressive but higher cost and can
suffer from lack of attentiveness from the remote side. We also run experiments
to compare the real-world performance of RDMA- and RPC-based data structure
operations with the predicted performance to evaluate the accuracy of our
model, and show that while the model does not always precisely predict running
time, it allows us to choose the best implementation in the examples shown. We
believe this analysis will assist developers in designing data structures that
will perform well on current network architectures, as well as network
architects in providing better support for this class of distributed data
structures.

widely-used quasi-experimental tools for causal inference. A crucial assumption
on which they rely is that the running variable cannot be manipulated -- an
assumption frequently violated in practice, jeopardizing point identification.
In this paper, we introduce a novel method that provide partial identification
bounds on the causal parameter of interest in sharp and fuzzy RDDs. The method
first estimates the number of manipulators in the sample using a log-concavity
assumption on the un-manipulated density of the running variable. It then
derives best- and worst-case bounds when we delete that number of points from
the data, along with fast computational methods to obtain them. We apply this
procedure to a dataset of blood donations from the Abu Dhabi blood bank to
obtain the causal effect of donor deferral on future volunteering behavior. We
find that, despite significant manipulation in the data, we are able to detect
causal effects where traditional methods, such as donut-hole RDDs, fail.

leveraging AI tools for detecting PE. In this paper, we build a two-stage

importantly, does not require dense annotations. Given the challenges in
acquiring expert annotations in large-scale datasets, our approach produces
state-of-the-art results with very sparse emboli contours (at 10mm slice
spacing), while using models with significantly lower number of parameters. We
achieve AUC scores of 0.94 on the validation set and 0.85 on the test set of
highly severe PEs. Using a large, real-world dataset characterized by complex
PE types and patients from multiple hospitals, we present an elaborate

we show that ST and our proposed estimator, while applied to different types of

distribution defined by an arbitrary generative model has been proven to be
hard in general. In fact, the task is intractable even for simple models such

identify a pair of generative and discriminative models that enables tractable

expressive probabilistic circuits with certain structural constraints that

However, the machine learning-based diagnosis systems for PCa are often
constrained by the limited access to accurate lesion ground truth annotations

dependable on both quality and quantity of lesion annotations associated with
histopathologic findings, resulting in limited scalability and clinical
validation. Here, we propose the baseline MRI model to alternatively learn the
appearance of mp-MRI using radiology-confirmed negative MRI cases via weakly
supervised learning. Since PCa lesions are case-specific and highly
heterogeneous, it is assumed to be challenging to synthesize PCa lesions using
the baseline MRI model, while it would be relatively easier to synthesize the
normal appearance in mp-MRI. We then utilize the baseline MRI model to infer
the pixel-wise suspiciousness of PCa by comparing the original and synthesized
MRI with two distance functions. We trained and validated the baseline MRI
model using 1,145 negative prostate mp-MRI scans. For evaluation, we used
separated 232 mp-MRI scans, consisting of both positive and negative MRI cases.
The 116 positive MRI scans were annotated by radiologists, confirmed with
post-surgical whole-gland specimens. The suspiciousness map was evaluated by
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for PCa lesions versus non-PCa

on fixed graph structures; however, real-world networks are often dynamic. We
address this challenge with a novel end-to-end node-embedding model, called
Dynamic Embedding for Textual Networks with a Gaussian Process (DetGP). After
training, DetGP can be applied efficiently to dynamic graphs without
re-training or backpropagation. The learned representation of each node is a
combination of textual and structural embeddings. Because the structure is
allowed to be dynamic, our method uses the Gaussian process to take advantage
of its non-parametric properties. To use both local and global graph
structures, diffusion is used to model multiple hops between neighbors. The
relative importance of global versus local structure for the embeddings is
learned automatically. With the non-parametric nature of the Gaussian process,
updating the embeddings for a changed graph structure requires only a forward
pass through the learned model. Considering link prediction and node
classification, experiments demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our
method compared to baseline approaches. We further show that DetGP can be
straightforwardly and efficiently applied to dynamic textual networks.

high level of accuracy in face recognition (FR). However, matching faces
captured in unconstrained video against a gallery with a single reference
facial still per individual typically yields low accuracy. For improved
robustness to intra-class variations, SRC techniques for FR have recently been
extended to incorporate variational information from an external generic set
into an auxiliary dictionary. Despite their success in handling linear
variations, non-linear variations (e.g., pose and expressions) between probe
and reference facial images cannot be accurately reconstructed with a linear
combination of images in the gallery and auxiliary dictionaries because they do
not share the same type of variations. In order to account for non-linear
variations due to pose, a paired sparse representation model is introduced
allowing for joint use of variational information and synthetic face images.
The proposed model, called synthetic plus variational model, reconstructs a
probe image by jointly using (1) a variational dictionary and (2) a gallery
dictionary augmented with a set of synthetic images generated over a wide
diversity of pose angles. The augmented gallery dictionary is then encouraged
to pair the same sparsity pattern with the variational dictionary for similar
pose angles by solving a newly formulated simultaneous sparsity-based
optimization problem. Experimental results obtained on Chokepoint and COX-S2V
datasets, using different face representations, indicate that the proposed
approach can outperform state-of-the-art SRC-based methods for still-to-video

model, if an agent defaults, every other node that trusted it is vulnerable to
loss. In a cryptocurrency context, trust is manufactured by capital deposits,
and thus there arises a natural tradeoff between network liquidity (i.e. the
fraction of transactions that succeed) and the cost of capital deposits.
  In this paper, we introduce constraints that bound the total amount of loss
that the rest of the network can suffer if an agent (or a set of agents) were
to default - equivalently, how the network changes if agents can support
limited solvency guarantees.
  We show that these constraints preserve the analytical structure of a credit
network. Furthermore, we show that aggregate borrowing constraints greatly
simplify the network structure and in the payment network context achieve the
optimal tradeoff between liquidity and amount of escrowed capital.

electrons with an appreciable initial transverse momentum that are unable to
gain significant energy from the laser in the absence of the magnetic field due
to strong dephasing. It is shown that the magnetic field can initiate an energy
increase by rotating such an electron, so that its momentum becomes directed
forward. The energy gain continues well beyond this turning point where the
dephasing drops to a very small value. In contrast to the case of purely vacuum
acceleration, the electron experiences a rapid energy increases with the
analytically derived maximum energy gain dependent on the strength of the
magnetic field and the phase velocity of the wave. The energy enhancement by
the magnetic field can be useful at high laser amplitudes, $a_0 \gg 1$, where
the acceleration similar to that in the vacuum is unable to produce energetic
electrons over just tens of microns. A strong magnetic field helps leverage an
increase in $a_0$ without a significant increase in the interaction length.

simplified to explain several properties of identified small voids in

scales. The Press-Schechter model with the linear critical threshold of void
{\delta}_v = -2.71, or a naive power law, is found to provide an excellent
agreement with the void size function, suggesting that the void-in-cloud effect
does not suppress as much voids as predicted by the SvdW model. (ii) We then
measured the density and velocity profiles of small voids, and find that they
are mostly partially collapsing underdensities, instead of being completely
crushed in the standard void-in-cloud scenario. (iii) Finally, we measure the
void distributions in four different tidal environments, and find that the
void-in-void effect alone can explain the correlation between distribution and
environments, whereas the void-in-cloud effect is only weakly influencing the

free inner core nutation (FICN), which is characterized by a tilt of the
rotation axis of the inner core with respect to the rotation axis of the outer
core. The differential rotation between the inner core and the outer core
induces fluid motions in the outer core and gives rise to Ohmic dissipation in
the presence of the Earth's internal magnetic field. Nutation measurements can
reflect such dissipation if it is sufficiently strong and thus can provide
insights into the properties and dynamics of the Earth's core. In this study we
perform a set of numerical calculations of the linear perturbations in the
outer core induced by the FICN at very low Ekman numbers (as small as
$10^{-11}$). Our numerical results show that the back-reaction of the magnetic
field notably alters the structure and length scale of the perturbations
induced by the FICN, and thus influences the Ohmic dissipation resulting from
the perturbations. When the Ekman number is sufficiently small, Ohmic
dissipation tends to be insensitive to the fluid viscosity and to the magnetic
diffusivity, which allows us to estimate the Ohmic dissipation associated with
the FICN without relying on an extrapolation. In contrast to the results of
Buffett (2010b), the estimated Ohmic dissipation based on our numerical
calculations is too weak to account for the observed damping of the FICN mode.
This also implies that nutation measurements cannot provide effective
constraints on the strength of the magnetic field inside the Earth's outer
core.

emerging as a promising technology for powering fast intelligence acquisition
for edge devices from distributed data generated at the network edge. One
critical task of edge learning is to efficiently utilize the limited radio
resource to acquire data samples for model training at an edge server. In this
paper, we develop a novel user scheduling algorithm for data acquisition in
edge learning, called (data) importance-aware scheduling. A key feature of this
scheduling algorithm is that it takes into account the informativeness of data
samples, besides communication reliability. Specifically, the scheduling
decision is based on a data importance indicator (DII), elegantly incorporating
two ""important"" metrics from communication and learning perspectives, i.e., the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and data uncertainty. We first derive an explicit
expression for this indicator targeting the classic classifier of support
vector machine (SVM), where the uncertainty of a data sample is measured by its
distance to the decision boundary. Then, the result is extended to

over the years which formulate the energy saving process as a competitive game

the clusters can then be targeted with tailored incentives. The key to above
segmentation analysis is to learn the features leading to human decision making

lasso based approach to perform such segmentation, by studying the feature
correlations in a real-world energy social game dataset. To further improve the
explainability of the model, we perform causality study using grangers

demonstrating different energy usage behaviors. We also present avenues to

solving the problem with its closed-form solution on the fly with the setup of

task to adapt all features from a shared task-agnostic embedding space into a
more discriminative task-specific metric space. Moreover, we further leverage
an attention-based bi-directional similarity strategy for extracting the more
robust relationship between queries and prototypes. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets show that our framework is superior to other existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the few-shot

(10^{56-57} erg) that occurred in the Galactic Centre a few million years ago.
The clearest indications are the x-ray/gamma-ray ""10 kpc bubbles"" identified by
the Rosat and Fermi satellites. In an earlier paper, we suggested another
manifestation of this nuclear activity, i.e. elevated H-alpha emission along a
section of the Magellanic Stream due to a burst (or flare) of ionizing
radiation from Sgr A*. We now provide further evidence for a powerful flare
event: UV absorption line ratios (in particular CIV/CII, SiIV/SiII) observed by
the Hubble Space Telescope reveal that some Stream clouds towards both galactic
poles are highly ionized by a source capable of producing ionization energies
up to at least 50 eV. We show how these are clouds caught in a beam of bipolar,
radiative ""ionization cones"" from a Seyfert nucleus associated with Sgr A*. In
our model, the biconic axis is tilted by about 15 deg from the South Galactic
Pole with an opening angle of roughly 60 deg. For the Stream at such large
Galactic distances (D > 75 kpc), nuclear activity is a plausible explanation
for all of the observed signatures: elevated H-alpha emission and H ionization
fraction (X_e > 0.5), enhanced CIV/CII and SiIV/SiII ratios, and high CIV and
SiIV column densities. Wind-driven ""shock cones"" are ruled out because the
Fermi bubbles lose their momentum and energy to the Galactic corona long before
reaching the Stream. The nuclear flare event must have had a radiative UV
luminosity close to the Eddington limit (f_E ~ 0.1-1). Our time-dependent
Seyfert flare models adequately explain the observations and indicate the
Seyfert flare event took place T_o = 3.5 +/- 1 Myr ago. The timing estimates
are consistent with the mechanical timescales needed to explain the
x-ray/gamma-ray bubbles in leptonic jet/wind models (2-8 Myr).

what does it mean to ""make sense"" of a sensory sequence? In our formalization,
making sense involves constructing a symbolic causal theory that both explains
the sensory sequence and also satisfies a set of unity conditions. The unity
conditions insist that the constituents of the causal theory -- objects,
properties, and laws -- must be integrated into a coherent whole. On our
account, making sense of sensory input is a type of program synthesis, but it
is unsupervised program synthesis.
  Our second contribution is a computer implementation, the Apperception
Engine, that was designed to satisfy the above requirements. Our system is able
to produce interpretable human-readable causal theories from very small amounts
of data, because of the strong inductive bias provided by the unity conditions.
A causal theory produced by our system is able to predict future sensor
readings, as well as retrodict earlier readings, and impute (fill in the blanks

  We tested the engine in a diverse variety of domains, including cellular
automata, rhythms and simple nursery tunes, multi-modal binding problems,
occlusion tasks, and sequence induction intelligence tests. In each domain, we
test our engine's ability to predict future sensor values, retrodict earlier
sensor values, and impute missing sensory data. The engine performs well in all
these domains, significantly out-performing neural net baselines. We note in
particular that in the sequence induction intelligence tests, our system
achieved human-level performance. This is notable because our system is not a
bespoke system designed specifically to solve intelligence tests, but a
general-purpose system that was designed to make sense of any sensory sequence.

the amount of labeled data by learning a policy that selects which samples

representations, such as QA-SRL. We show that even an oracle policy that is
allowed to pick examples that maximize performance on the test set (and
constitutes an upper bound on the potential of LTAL), does not substantially
improve performance compared to a random policy. We investigate factors that
could explain this finding and show that a distinguishing characteristic of
successful applications of LTAL is the interaction between optimization and the
oracle policy selection process. In successful applications of LTAL, the
examples selected by the oracle policy do not substantially depend on the
optimization procedure, while in our setup the stochastic nature of
optimization strongly affects the examples selected by the oracle. We conclude
that the current applicability of LTAL for improving data efficiency in
learning semantic meaning representations is limited.

knowledge of $n$, the size of the network. This assumption is challenged here
by proving how much a-priori knowledge is necessary for equilibrium in
different distributed computing problems. Duplication - pretending to be more
than one agent - is the main tool used by agents to deviate and increase their
utility when not enough knowledge about $n$ is given. The a-priori knowledge of
$n$ is formalized as a Bayesian setting where at the beginning of the algorithm
agents only know a prior $\sigma$, a distribution from which they know $n$
originates. We begin by providing new algorithms for the Knowledge Sharing and
Coloring problems when $n$ is a-priori known to all agents. We then prove that
when agents have no a-priori knowledge of $n$, i.e., the support for $\sigma$
is infinite, equilibrium is impossible for the Knowledge Sharing problem.
Finally, we consider priors with finite support and find bounds on the
necessary interval $[\alpha,\beta]$ that contains the support of $\sigma$,
i.e., $\alpha \leq n \leq \beta$, for which we have an equilibrium. When
possible, we extend these bounds to hold for any possible protocol.

acquire a partial view of the world. However, in realistic settings, one or
more agents that show arbitrarily faulty or malicious behavior may suffice to
let the current coordination mechanisms fail. In this paper, we study a
practical scenario considering the security issues in the presence of agents
with arbitrarily faulty or malicious behavior. Under these circumstances,
learning an optimal policy becomes particularly challenging, even in the
unrealistic case that an agent's policy can be made conditional upon all other
agents' observations. To overcome these difficulties, we present an
Attention-based Fault-Tolerant (FT-Attn) algorithm which selects correct and
relevant information for each agent at every time-step. The multi-head
attention mechanism enables the agents to learn effective communication
policies through experience concurrently to the action policies. Empirical
results have shown that FT-Attn beats previous state-of-the-art methods in some
complex environments and can adapt to various kinds of noisy environments
without tuning the complexity of the algorithm. Furthermore, FT-Attn can
effectively deal with the complex situation where an agent needs to reach
multiple agents' correct observation at the same time.

task involves two operations, i.e., cube rearrangement and cube rotation, which
enforce networks to learn translational and rotational invariant features from
raw 3D data. Compared to the train-from-scratch strategy, fine-tuning from the

various appealing properties of SGLD, ranging from the convergence properties

from a novel perspective of membership privacy protection (i.e., preventing the

specific sample is used for training a given DNN model, has emerged as a common
threat against deep learning algorithms. To this end, we build a theoretical
framework to analyze the information leakage (w.r.t. the training dataset) of a
model trained using SGLD. Based on this framework, we demonstrate that SGLD can
prevent the information leakage of the training dataset to a certain extent.
Moreover, our theoretical analysis can be naturally extended to other types of
Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) methods. Empirical
results on different datasets and models verify our theoretical findings and
suggest that the SGLD algorithm can not only reduce the information leakage but

grows when an atomic wind expands into an atomic medium. In all other cases,
the interaction shell region fragments into radial protrusions due to molecular
cooling and chemistry. The resulting fingers eliminate any global slip parallel
to the shell surface. This rough surface implies that weak shocks are prominent
in the excitation of the gas despite the fast speed of advance. This may
explain why low excitation molecular hydrogen is found towards the front of
elliptical pPN. We constrain molecular dissociative fractions and timescales of
fast $\mathrm H_2$ winds and the pPN lifetime with wind densities

and discuss the possible diffusions that extend Brownian motion to the
singularity. This gives a quick proof and clear intuition for the fact that
heat can only cross the singularity for an intermediate range of the parameter.
When crossing is possible and the singularity consists of one point, we give a
complete description of these diffusions, and we describe a ""best"" extension,
which respects the isometry group of the surface and also realizes the unique
symmetric one-point extension of the Brownian motion, in the sense of
Chen-Fukushima. This extension, however, does not correspond to the bridging
extension, which was introduced by Boscain-Prandi, when they previously
considered self-adjoint extensions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the
Riemannian part for these surfaces. We clarify that several of the extensions
they considered induce diffusions that are carried by the Marin
compactification at the singularity, which is much larger than the (one-point)
metric completion. In the case when the singularity is more than one-point, a
complete classification of diffusions extending Brownian motion would be
unwieldy. Nonetheless, we again describe a ""best"" extension which respects the
isometry group, and in this case, this diffusion corresponds to the bridging
extension. A prominent role is played by Bessel processes (of every real
dimension) and the classical theory of one-dimensional diffusions and their
boundary conditions.

found that neutron-star radii are significantly affected by the crust segment.
On the other hand, the neutron-star radii are also strongly dependent on the

swarm of robots that collectively forage, that is, collect resources from
multiple sources in the environment. While foraging, the swarm explores the
environment and makes a collective decision on how to exploit the available
resources, either by selecting a single source or concurrently exploiting more
than one. At the same time, the robots locally exchange messages in order to
agree on how to name each source. Here, we study the correlation between the
task-induced interaction network and the emergent naming conventions. In
particular, our goal is to determine whether the dynamics of the interaction
network are sufficient to determine an emergent vocabulary that is potentially
useful to the robot swarm. To be useful, linguistic conventions need to be
compact and meaningful, that is, to be the minimal description of the relevant
features of the environment and of the made collective decision. We show that,
in order to obtain a useful vocabulary, the task-dependent interaction network
alone is not sufficient but it must be combined with a correlation between
language and foraging dynamics. On the basis of these results, we propose a
decentralised algorithm for collective categorisation which enables the swarm
to achieve a useful -- compact and meaningful -- naming of all the available
sources. Understanding how useful linguistic conventions emerge contributes to
the design of robot swarms with potentially improved autonomy, flexibility, and
self-awareness.

the Markov system of each node is described as an elegant block-structured

extends a simple queueing system of a node to a more general block-structured

the paper establishes a more general product-form solution for the closed

general framework to describe intracellular pattern formation. These systems
have been used to model the conformational switching of proteins as they cycle
from an inactive state in the cell cytoplasm, to an active state at the cell
membrane. The active state then acts as input to downstream effectors. The
paradigm of activation by recruitment to the membrane underpins a range of
biological pathways - including G-protein signalling, growth control through
Ras and PI 3-kinase, and cell polarity through Rac and Rho; all activate their
targets by recruiting them from the cytoplasm to the membrane. Global mass
conservation lies at the heart of these models reflecting the property that the
total number of active and inactive forms, and targets, remains constant. Here
we present a conservative arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) finite element
method for the approximate solution of systems of bulk-surface
reaction-diffusion equations on an evolving two-dimensional domain. Fundamental
to the success of the method is the robust generation of bulk and surface
meshes. For this purpose, we use a moving mesh partial differential equation
(MMPDE) approach. Global conservation of the fully discrete finite element
solution is established independently of the ALE velocity field and the time
step size. The developed method is applied to model problems with known
analytical solutions; these experiments indicate that the method is
second-order accurate and globally conservative. The method is further applied
to a model of a single cell migrating in the presence of an external
chemotactic signal.

a new regularization as an optimal transport. The paper proposes a stacked
Wasserstein autoencoder (SWAE) to learn a deep latent variable model. SWAE is a
hierarchical model, which relaxes the optimal transport constraints at two
stages. At the first stage, the SWAE flexibly learns a representation
distribution, i.e., the encoded prior; and at the second stage, the encoded
representation distribution is approximated with a latent variable model under
the regularization encouraging the latent distribution to match the explicit
prior. This model allows us to generate natural textual outputs as well as
perform manipulations in the latent space to induce changes in the output

monolayer per cycle; the CdTe films revealed different growth rates in

short purge times and larger Cd exposure times led to not self regulated growth

Cd exposure times, following a Brunauer-Emmett and Teller-type adsorption.
However, for longer purge times and or short Cd exposure times, an ALE self
regulated regime was achieved with 2 ML per cycle. In this sense, the
self-regulation of the growth is limited by desorption, instead of absorption,

conditional variational auto-encoders. Our approach requires only direct
optimization, works well with limited data and significantly outperforms the

used as additional training samples in an extrinsic intent classification task,
leading to improved performance by up to 5\% absolute f-score in low-resource

peak-shaving, demand response, and frequency regulation. However, a lithium-ion
battery is degrading while cycling and would be scrapped when the capacity
reduces to a certain threshold (e.g. 80%). Such scrapping criterion may not
explore the maximum benefit from the battery storage. In this paper, we propose
a novel scrapping criterion for peak-shaving energy storage based on battery
efficiency, time-of-use price, and arbitrage benefit. A new battery life model
with scrapping parameters is then derived using this criterion. Embedded with
the life model, an optimal operation method for peak-shaving energy storage
system is presented. The results of case study show that the operation method
could maximize the benefits of peak-shaving energy storage while delaying
battery degradation. Compared with the traditional 80% capacity-based scrapping
criterion, our efficiency-based scrapping criterion can significantly improve
the lifetime benefit of the battery.

industry, as well as in biomedical research. Additive-lathe 3D printing is an
emerging sub-class of 3D printing whereby material is layered outward from the
surface of a rotating cylindrical mandrel. While established additive
manufacturing technologies have developed robust toolpath generation software,
additive-lathe publications to date have been relegated to the most basic of
proof-of-concept structures. This paper details the theory and implementation
of a method for slicing a triangulated surface with a series of concentric,
open, right circular cylinders that represents a crucial step in creating
toolpaths to print complex models with additive-lathe technology. Valid edge
cases are detailed which must be addressed when implementing a cylindrical
slicer to produce non-intersecting closed contours; two classes of resultant
closed contour are described. Methodologies for generating infill patterns,
support structures and other considerations for toolpath construction are
required prior to full implementation of a machine capable of printing complex
geometry from a digital model onto a rotating cylindrical surface. This work
represents the first thorough examination of the mathematics and algorithmic
implementation of triangle mesh slicing with concentric cylinders and offers
insights for future works in toolpath generation for the additive-lathe type 3D
printer.

difficult to assess using current genomic sequencing technologies. Optical
mapping technologies, which measure the size of chromosomal fragments between
labeled markers, offer an alternative approach. As these technologies mature
towards becoming clinical tools, there is a need to develop an approach for
determining the optimal strategy for sampling biological material in order to
detect a variant at some threshold. Here we develop an optimization approach
using a simple, yet realistic, model of the genomic mapping process using a
hyper-geometric distribution and {probabilistic} concentration inequalities.
Our approach is both computationally and analytically tractable and includes a
novel approach to getting tail bounds of hyper-geometric distribution. We show
that if a genomic mapping technology can sample most of the chromosomal
fragments within a sample, comparatively little biological material is needed
to detect a variant at high confidence.

settings where each individual desires a positive classification---including
many important applications such as hiring and school admissions, we study a
dynamic learning setting where individuals invest in a positive outcome based
on their group's expected gain and the decision rule is updated to maximize
institutional benefit. By characterizing the equilibria of these dynamics, we
show that natural challenges to desirable long-term outcomes arise due to
heterogeneity across groups and the lack of realizability. We consider two
interventions, decoupling the decision rule by group and subsidizing the cost
of investment. We show that decoupling achieves optimal outcomes in the
realizable case but has discrepant effects that may depend on the initial
conditions otherwise. In contrast, subsidizing the cost of investment is shown
to create better equilibria for the disadvantaged group even in the absence of
realizability.

  Objective: This study aims to review and classify studies that propose/use
maturity assessment or maturity models (MMs) as a vehicle to achieve
operational excellence in healthcare domain.
  Method: To achieve this objective, we performed a Multivocal Literature
Review (MLR) that is a form of Systematic Review and includes data from the
grey literature (e.g., white papers and online documents) in addition to
formal, peer-reviewed literature.
  Results: Based on 101 sources, 80 of which are from the peer-reviewed
literature and 21 are from the grey literature, we identified 68 different MMs
on, e.g., telemedicine, care pathways, and digital imaging. We reviewed them
with respect to various aspects including: types of research and contribution;
list of MMs proposed/used with their subject focuses; elements of
maturity/capability; and application scope or scale. In the synthesis of
empirical benefits of using MMs, two were found significant: (1) Identifying
issues and providing guidance for improvement in healthcare contexts; (2)
Improving efficiency, effectiveness, performance, and productivity.
  Conclusion: This MLR provides an overview of the landscape and serves as an
index to the vast body of knowledge in this area. Our review creates an
opportunity to cope with the challenges in getting an overview of the

does not require imposing inductive biases on the architecture of the agents.
We experimentally show the emergence of compositional communication using
topographical similarity, zero-shot generalization and context independence as
evaluation metrics. The presented approach is connected to an important line of
work in semiotics and developmental psycholinguistics: it supports a conjecture
that compositional communication is scaffolded on simpler communication

the predictions to the choice of the exchange correlation function. In this
work, we rigorously explore the sensitivity of finite temperature thermodynamic
properties to the choice of the exchange correlation functional using the
built-in error estimation capabilities within the Bayesian Error Estimation
Functional. The vibrational properties are estimated using the Debye model and
we quantify the uncertainty associated with finite-temperature properties for a
diverse collection of materials. We find good agreement with experiment and
small spread in predictions over different exchange correlation functionals for
Mg, Al$_2$O$_3$, Al, Ca, and GaAs. In the case of Li, Li$_2$O, and NiO,
however, we find a large spread in predictions as well as disagreement between
experiment and functionals due to complex bonding environments. While the
energetics generated by BEEF-vdW ensemble is typically normal, the complex
mapping through the Debye model leads to the derived finite temperature
properties having non-Gaussian behavior. We test a wide variety of probability
distributions that best represent the finite temperature distribution and find
that properties such as specific heat, Gibbs free energy, entropy, and the
thermal expansion coefficient are well described by normal or transformed
normal distributions, while the prediction spread of volume at a given
temperature does not appear to be drawn from a single distribution.

the upper envelope of a family of abstract affine functions (being conventional
vertical translations of the abstract linear functions). We establish new
conditions for zero duality gap under no topological assumptions on the space

the topology of pointwise convergence, we extend several fundamental facts of

a constraint qualification for zero duality gap which extends a fact

Circular-ranging (CR) OCT methods use optical-domain compression to surpass
this limit. However, the CR-OCT system architectures of prior reports were
limited by poor stability and were confined to the 1.55 um wavelength range. In
this work, we describe a novel CR-OCT architecture that is free from these
limitations. To ensure stable operation, temperature sensitive optical modules
within the system were replaced; the kilometer-length fiber spools used in the
stretched-pulse mode-locked (SPML) laser was eliminated in favor of a single 10
meter, continuously chirped fiber Bragg grating, and the interferometer's
passive optical quadrature demodulation circuit was replaced by an active
technique using a lithium niobate phase modulator. For improved imaging
penetration in biological tissues, the system operating wavelength was shifted
to a center wavelength of 1.29 um by leveraging the wavelength flexibility
intrinsic to CFBG-based dispersive fibers. These improvements were achieved
while maintaining a broad (100 nm) optical bandwidth, a long 4 cm imaging
range, and a high 7.6 MHz A-line rate. By enhancing stability, simplifying
overall system design, and operating at 1.3 um, this CR-OCT architecture will
allow a broader exploration of CR-OCT in both medical and non-medical
