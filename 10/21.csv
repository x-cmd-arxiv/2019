  Triconnectivity","Accepted for publication at SODA'20",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that every labelled planar graph $G$ can be assigned a canonical
embedding $\phi(G)$, such that for any planar $G'$ that differs from $G$ by the
insertion or deletion of one edge, the number of local changes to the
combinatorial embedding needed to get from $\phi(G)$ to $\phi(G')$ is $O(\log
n)$.
  In contrast, there exist embedded graphs where $\Omega(n)$ changes are
necessary to accommodate one inserted edge. We provide a matching lower bound
of $\Omega(\log n)$ local changes, and although our upper bound is worst-case,
our lower bound hold in the amortized case as well.
  Our proof is based on BC trees and SPQR trees, and we develop
\emph{pre-split} variants of these for general graphs, based on a novel biased
heavy-path decomposition, where the structural changes corresponding to edge
insertions and deletions in the underlying graph consist of at most $O(\log n)$
basic operations of a particularly simple form.
  As a secondary result, we show how to maintain the pre-split trees under edge
insertions in the underlying graph deterministically in worst case $O(\log^3
n)$ time. Using this, we obtain deterministic data structures for incremental
planarity testing, incremental planar embedding, and incremental
triconnectivity, that each have worst case $O(\log^3 n)$ update and query time,
answering an open question by La Poutr\'e and Westbrook from 1998.

pre-alignment filter that remarkably reduces the need for computationally
costly sequence alignment. The key idea of SneakySnake is to reduce the
approximate string matching (ASM) problem to the single net routing (SNR)
problem in VLSI chip layout. In the SNR problem, we are interested in finding
the optimal path that connects two terminals with the least routing cost on a
special grid layout that contains obstacles. The SneakySnake algorithm quickly
solves the SNR problem and uses the found optimal path to decide whether or not
performing sequence alignment is necessary. Reducing the ASM problem into SNR
also makes SneakySnake efficient to implement on CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs.
Results: SneakySnake significantly improves the accuracy of pre-alignment
filtering by up to four orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art
pre-alignment filters, Shouji, GateKeeper, and SHD. For short sequences,
SneakySnake accelerates Edlib (state-of-the-art implementation of Myers's
bit-vector algorithm) and Parasail (state-of-the-art sequence aligner with a
configurable scoring function), by up to 37.7x and 43.9x (>12x on average),
respectively, with its CPU implementation, and by up to 413x and 689x (>400x on
average), respectively, with FPGA and GPU acceleration. For long sequences, the
CPU implementation of SneakySnake accelerates Parasail and KSW2 (sequence
aligner of minimap2) by up to 979x (276.9x on average) and 91.7x (31.7x on
average), respectively. As SneakySnake does not replace sequence alignment,
users can still obtain all capabilities (e.g., configurable scoring functions)
of the aligner of their choice, unlike existing acceleration efforts that
sacrifice some aligner capabilities. Availability:

separability based on semi-orthogonality of a matrix and Frobenius distance,
and the feed-backward reconstruction loss which explicitly encourages weight
separability between the column vectors in the weight matrix. The experimental
results on image classification and face recognition demonstrate that the
weight separability boosting via minimization of feed-backward reconstruction
loss can improve the visual recognition performance, hence universally boosting
the performance on various visual recognition tasks.

compressible nonlinear elasticity. The independent unknowns of these conformal
methods are displacement, displacement gradient, and the first Piola-Kirchhoff
stress tensor. The so-called edge finite elements of the curl operator is
employed to discretize the trial space of displacement gradients. Motivated by
the differential complex of nonlinear elasticity, this choice guarantees that
discrete displacement gradients satisfy the Hadamard jump condition for the
strain compatibility. We study the stability of the proposed mixed finite
element methods by deriving some inf-sup conditions. By considering 32 choices
of simplicial conformal finite elements of degrees 1 and 2, we show that 10
choices are not stable as they do not satisfy the inf-sup conditions. We
numerically study the stable choices and conclude that they can achieve optimal
convergence rates. By solving several 2D and 3D numerical examples, we show
that the proposed methods are capable of providing accurate approximations of
strain and stress.

In this study, we numerically analyze the particle migration in stratified flow
of two liquids of different viscosities flowing parallel to each other between
two infinite parallel plates. Particle migration in two different flow fields
is considered: (i) Couette flow and (ii) Poiseuille flow. A numerical approach
using an immersed boundary method is employed to perform two dimensional
simulations and determine conditions when particle migration from one fluid to
the other can occur. This has implications in separating particles from a fluid
without a membrane. The effect of the viscosity ratio, flowrate ratio, Reynolds
number and particle size on focusing position are analyzed to identify
conditions under which the particle migrates from one fluid to the other. It is
shown that the particle migrates to the fluid with a lower viscosity in case of
stratified Couette flow when the holdup of the low viscous fluid is
sufficiently high. In Poiseuille flow, particle migrates to the less viscous
fluid beyond a critical flowrate ratio for a fixed viscosity ratio. This
critical flowrate ratio increases with particle size.

can be further improved. The case study applies and analyzes the methods on the

are currently limited by magnetic photospheric activity. Suppression of
convective blueshift is the dominant magnetic contribution to RV variability in
low-activity Sun-like stars. Due to convective plasma motions, the magnitude of
RV contributions from the suppression of convective blueshift is related to the
depth of formation of photospheric spectral lines of a given species used to
compute the RV time series. Meunier et al. (2017), used this relation to
demonstrate a method for spectroscopic extraction of the suppression of
convective blueshift in order to isolate RV contributions, including planetary
RVs, that contribute equally to the timeseries for each spectral line. Here, we
extract disk-integrated solar RVs from observations over a 2.5 year time span
made with the solar telescope integrated with the HARPS-N spectrograph at the
Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (La Palma, Canary Islands, Spain). We apply the
methods outlined by Meunier et al. (2017). We are not, however, able to isolate
physically meaningful contributions of the suppression of convective blueshift
from this solar dataset, potentially because our dataset is from solar minimum
when the suppression of convective blueshift may not sufficiently dominate
activity contributions to RVs. This result indicates that, for low-activity
Sun-like stars, one must include additional RV contributions from activity
sources not considered in the Meunier et al. (2017) model at different
timescales as well as instrumental variation in order to reach the sub-meter
per second RV sensitivity necessary to detect low-mass planets in orbit around
Sun-like stars.

allow users to disclose partial information, such as the elevation profile for
an activity, which supposedly will not leak the location trajectory.
  In this work we examine the extent to which publicly available elevation
profiles can be used to predict the location trajectory of users. To tackle
this problem, we devise three threat settings under which the city, borough, or
even a route can be predicted. Those threat settings define the amount of
information available to the adversary to launch the prediction attacks.
Establishing that simple features of elevation profiles, e.g., spectral
features, are insufficient, we devise both natural language processing

representation of elevation profiles, and we convert the problem at hand into
text and image classification problem. We use both traditional machine
learning- and deep learning-based techniques, and achieve a prediction success
rate ranging from 59.59% to 95.83%. The findings are alarming, and highlight
that sharing information such as elevation profile may have significant privacy

With this procedure we exploit an intriguing property of standard
overparameterized convolutional neural networks trained with (stochastic)

two classification problems, a subset of ImageNet and CIFAR-10. For both, we
construct large candidate datasets without any explicit human annotations, that
only contain 10%-50% correctly labeled examples per class. We show that
training on the candidate examples and regularizing through early stopping
gives higher test performance for both problems than when training on the
original, clean data. This is possible because the candidate datasets contain a
huge number of clean examples, and, as we show in this paper, the noise
generated through the label collection process is not nearly as adversarial for
learning as the noise generated by randomly flipping labels.

nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) on the model parametrization does not occur, ii)
it allows to study NMEs, not only for the fundamental state in daughter nuclei,

closer to the stars. However, direct imaging requires an AO system and
high-contrast techniques like a coronagraph to reject the diffracted light of
an observed star and an additional wavefront sensor to control quasi-static
aberrations, including the non common path aberrations. To observe faint
objects, a focal plane wavefront sensor with a sub-nanometric wavefront control
capability is required. In the past few years, we developed the THD2 bench
which is a testbed for high-contrast imaging techniques, working in visible and
near infrared wavelengths and currently reaching contrast levels lower than
1e-8 under space-like simulated conditions. We recently added a turbulence
wheel on the optical path which simulates the residuals given by a typical
extreme adaptive optics system and we tested several ways to remove
quasi-statics speckles. One way to estimate the aberrations is a method called
pair-wise probing where we record few images with known-shapes we apply on the
adaptive optics deformable mirror. Once estimated, we seek to minimize the
focal-plane electric field by an algorithm called Electric Field Conjugation.
In this paper, we present the first results obtained on the THD2 bench using
these two techniques together in turbulent conditions. We then compare the
achieved performance with the one expected when all the quasi-static speckles
are corrected.

vision application domains. Existing work only implicitly models the spatial

that decomposes the prediction into individual joints by means of a structured
prediction layer that explicitly models the joint dependencies. This is
implemented via a hierarchy of small-sized neural networks connected
analogously to the kinematic chains in the human body as well as a joint-wise
decomposition in the loss function. The proposed layer is agnostic to the
underlying network and can be used with existing architectures for motion
modelling. Prior work typically leverages the H3.6M dataset. We show that some
state-of-the-art techniques do not perform well when trained and tested on
AMASS, a recently released dataset 14 times the size of H3.6M. Our experiments
indicate that the proposed layer increases the performance of motion
forecasting irrespective of the base network, joint-angle representation, and
prediction horizon. We furthermore show that the layer also improves motion
predictions qualitatively. We make code and models publicly available at

shows that the transition in the phase of a quantum system is also accompanied

improve the factor of log(n) to a constant when the Hamiltonian has commuting

where state spaces are represented as regular languages and transition
relations are expressed using rational relations over infinite (or finite)
strings. We extend the regular model checking paradigm to permit the use of
more powerful transition relations: the class of regular relations, of which
the rational relations are a strict subset. We use the language of monadic
second-order logic on infinite strings to specify such relations and adopt
streaming string transducers (SSTs) as a suitable computational model. We
introduce nondeterministic SSTs over infinite strings and show that they
precisely capture the relations definable in MSO. We further explore
theoretical properties of omega-NSSTs required to effectively carry out regular
model checking. In particular, we establish that the regular type checking
problem for omega-NSSTs is decidable in PSPACE. Since the post-image of a
regular language under a regular relation may not be regular (or even
context-free), approaches that iteratively compute the image can not be
effectively carried out in this setting. Instead, we utilize the fact that
regular relations are closed under composition, which, together with our
decidability result, provides a foundation for regular model checking with
regular relations.

state-of-the-art performance in many tasks. However, their distributed feature
representations are difficult to interpret semantically. In this work,
human-interpretable semantic concepts are associated with vectors in feature
space. The association process is mathematically formulated as an optimization
problem. The semantic vectors obtained from the optimal solution are applied to
interpret deep neural networks globally and locally. The global interpretations
are useful to understand the knowledge learned by DNNs. The interpretation of
local behaviors can help to understand individual decisions made by DNNs
better. The empirical experiments demonstrate how to use identified semantics
to interpret the existing DNNs.

networks in recent years. A number of model-aware saliency methods were
proposed to explain individual classification decisions by creating saliency
maps. However, they are not applicable when the parameters and the gradients of
the underlying models are unavailable. Recently, model-agnostic methods have
also received attention. As one of them, \textit{Prediction Difference
Analysis} (PDA), a probabilistic sound methodology, was proposed. In this work,
we first show that PDA can suffer from saturated classifiers. The saturation
phenomenon of classifiers exists widely in current neural network-based
classifiers. To explain the decisions of saturated classifiers better, we
further propose Contextual PDA, which runs hundreds of times faster than PDA.
The experiments show the superiority of our method by explaining image
classifications of the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks.

examined. Our numerical evidence shows that the proposed schemes are more
robust than the existing methods, and their efficiency is less restricted to

another interpretable logical network to form accurate and reasonable responses

the feature extraction stage of convolution neural network. However, although
researchers like Marco Gori have also made great efforts to improve the
interpretability of the fully connected layers of the network, the problem is

constructing logical network based on the fully connected layers and extracting
logical relation between input and output of the layers is proposed. The game
process between perceptual learning and logical abstract cognitive learning is
implemented to improve the interpretable performance of deep learning process

millimeter wave (mmWave) massive MIMO uplink as we scale up the number of base
station antennas, fixing the load factor, defined as the ratio of the number of
simultaneous users to the number of base station antennas. We consider a
modular approach in which the base station employs an array of subarrays, or
""tiles."" Each tile supports a fixed number of antennas, and can therefore be
implemented using a separate radio frequency integrated circuit (RFIC), with
synchronization across tiles accomplished by employing a phased locked loop in
each tile to synthesize an on-chip oscillator at the carrier frequency by
locking on to a common lower frequency reference clock. Assuming linear minimum
mean squared error (LMMSE) multiuser detection, we provide an analytical
framework that can be used to specify the required power spectral density (PSD)
mask for phase noise for a target system performance. Our analysis for the
phase noise at the output of the LMMSE receiver indicates two distinct effects:
self-noise for each user which is inversely proportional to the number of
tiles, and cross-talk between users which is insensitive to the number of
tiles, and is proportional to the load factor. These analytical predictions,
verified by simulations for a 140 GHz system targeting a per-user data rate of
10 Gbps, show that tiling is a robust approach for scaling. Numerical results
for our proposed design approach yield relatively relaxed specifications for
phase noise PSD masks.

devices (QD light-emitting-diodes, QLEDs). Though QDs have been synthesized

luminescence in QLEDs remains challenging. This is commonly attributed to
unbalanced charge injection and/or interfacial exciton quenching in the
devices, instead of lack of suited QD materials. Here, a general but previously
overlooked degradation channel in QLEDs, i.e., operando electrochemical
reactions of surface ligands with injected charge carriers, is identified after
systematic studies of various combination of core/shell QDs and ligands.
Applying electrochemically-inert ligands to highly photoluminescent QDs is
developed to bridge their photoluminescence-electroluminescence gap. This
material-design principle is general for boosting electroluminescence
efficiency and lifetime of the QLEDs, resulting in record-long operational
lifetimes for both red-emitting QLEDs (T95 > 3800 hours at 1000 cd m-2) and
blue-emitting QLEDs (T50 >10,000 hours at 100 cd m-2). Our study provides a

estimates of this paper occur when $s = 0$, thereby giving new sharp $L^p$ to
$L^q$ estimates for such operators, again up to endpoints.
  Our results lead to natural global analogues whose statements can be recast
in terms of a hyperplane integrability condition analogous to that of Iosevich

different modes of operation - yielding systems described as ""hybrid"",

of such systems, in space applications, could be spacecraft equipped with 1) a
variable-$I_{\text{sp}}$, variable-thrust engine or 2) multiple engines each

arise when an indirect optimization method is used, a new framework ---
Composite Smooth Control (CSC) --- is proposed that seeks smoothness over the
entire spectrum of distinct control inputs. A salient aftermath of the
application of the CSC framework is that the original multi-point
boundary-value problem can be treated as a two-point boundary-value problem
with smooth, differentiable control inputs; the latter is notably easier to
solve, yet can be made to accurately approximate the former hybrid problem. The
utility of the CSC framework is demonstrated through a multi-year,
multi-revolution heliocentric fuel-optimal trajectory for a spacecraft equipped
with a variable-$I_{\text{sp}}$, variable-thrust engine.

current interest . In this work we study the driving force for polyelectrolyte
complexation using molecular dynamics simulations. We calculate the potential
of mean force between poly(lysine) and poly(glutamate) oligomers using three
different forcefields, an atomistic force field and two coarse-grained force
fields. There is qualitative agreement between all forcefields, i.e., the sign
and magnitude of the free energy and the nature of the driving force are
similar, which suggests that the molecular nature of water does not play a
significant role. For fully charged peptides, we find that the driving force
for association is entropic in all cases when small ions either neutralize the
poly-ions, or are in excess. The removal of all counterions switches the
driving force, making complexation energetic. This suggests that the entropy of
complexation is dominated by the counterions. When only 6 residues of a 11-mer
are charged, however, the driving force is enthalpic in salt-free conditions.
The simulations shed insight into the mechanism of complex coacervation and the
importance of realistic models for the polyions.

approach, where a regularized iterative algorithm alternating between data
consistency and a regularizer is unrolled for a finite number of iterations.
This unrolled network is then trained end-to-end in a supervised manner, using
fully-sampled data as ground truth for the network output. However, in a number
of scenarios, it is difficult to obtain fully-sampled datasets, due to
physiological constraints such as organ motion or physical constraints such as
signal decay. In this work, we tackle this issue and propose a self-supervised
learning strategy that enables physics-based DL reconstruction without
fully-sampled data. Our approach is to divide the acquired sub-sampled points
for each scan into training and validation subsets. During training, data
consistency is enforced over the training subset, while the validation subset
is used to define the loss function. Results show that the proposed
self-supervised learning method successfully reconstructs images without
fully-sampled data, performing similarly to the supervised approach that is
trained with fully-sampled references. This has implications for physics-based
inverse problem approaches for other settings, where fully-sampled data is not
available or possible to acquire.

elements, are widely recognized as a key feature to describe complex problems
(see, e.g., specification languages such as B and Z). Notwithstanding, very few
tools exist supporting high-level automated reasoning on general formulas
involving intensional sets. In this paper we present a decision procedure for a
first-order logic language offering both extensional and (a restricted form of)
intensional sets (RIS). RIS are introduced as first-class citizens of the
language and set-theoretical operators on RIS are dealt with as constraints.
Syntactic restrictions on RIS guarantee that the denoted sets are finite,
though unbounded. The language of RIS, called L_RIS , is parametric with
respect to any first-order theory X providing at least equality and a decision
procedure for X-formulas. In particular, we consider the instance of L_RIS when
X is the theory of hereditarily finite sets and binary relations. We also
present a working implementation of this instance as part of the {log} tool and
we show through a number of examples and two case studies that, although RIS
are a subclass of general intensional sets, they are still sufficiently
expressive as to encode and solve many interesting problems. Finally, an
extensive empirical evaluation provides evidence that the tool can be used in
practice.

relatively poor functionality of unintuitive control schemes. This paper
proposes to extract, from multichannel electromyographic signals (EMG), motor
neuron spike trains and project them into lower dimensional continuous signals,
which are used as multichannel proportional inputs to control the prosthetic's
actuators. These control signals are an estimation of the common synaptic input
that the motor neurons receive. We use the simplest of metric learning
approaches known as principal component analysis (PCA), as a linear
unsupervised metric projection to extract the spectral information of high
dimensional data into the subspace of the prosthetic hand degrees of freedom.
We also investigate the importance of a rotation in the projection space that
best aligns the PCA subspace with the space of degrees of freedom of the
prosthetic hand, to attempt to approximate the sparseness properties of the
motor axes (which are orthogonal), while no sparseness is enforced by PCA.
Proof of concept for the feedforward path (open loop) is given by successful
estimation of concurrent movements with up to three degrees of freedom. We also
analyze and quantify the performance of the proposed decoding algorithm under
implementation constraints and hardware limitations and propose a space-time
subsampling strategy, to maximize projection fidelity, in each extracted source
over time. The results confirm that the proposed decoding approach can directly
project the motor neuron spike trains into kinematics for simultaneous and
proportional prosthesis control that can be extended to multiple degrees of
freedom. We show that the method is robust to reducing the training data in
space (number of sources) and time, which makes it potentially suitable for
clinical applications.

with very large topological invariants via periodic driving. As advocated by
this work, such Floquet engineering can be elegantly achieved by the particle
swarm optimization (PSO) technique from the swarm intelligence family. With the
recognition that conventional gradient-based optimization approaches are not
suitable for directly optimizing topological invariants as integers, the highly
effective PSO route yields new promises in the search for exotic topological
phases, requiring limited physical resource. Our results are especially timely
in view of two important insights from literature: low-frequency driving may be
beneficial in creating large topological invariants, but an open-ended
low-frequency driving often leads to drastic fluctuations in the obtained
topological invariants. Indeed, using a simple continuously driven Harper model
with three quasi-energy bands, we show that the Floquet-band Chern numbers can
enjoy many-fold increase compared with that using a simple harmonic driving of
the same period, without demanding more energy cost of the driving field. It is
also found that the resulting Floquet insulator bands are still well-gapped,
with the maximized topological invariants in agreement with physical
observations from Thouless pumping. The emergence of many edge modes under the
open boundary condition is also consistent with the bulk-edge correspondence.
Our results are expected to be highly useful towards the optimization of many
different types of topological invariants in Floquet topological matter.

settings to improve communication efficiency via periodical communication. For
decentralized settings, it is still unclear how to efficiently combine local
updates and decentralized communication. In this work, we propose an algorithm
named as LD-SGD, which incorporates arbitrary update schemes that alternate
between multiple Local updates and multiple Decentralized SGDs, and provide an
analytical framework for LD-SGD. Under the framework, we present a sufficient
condition to guarantee the convergence. We show that LD-SGD converges to a
critical point for a wide range of update schemes when the objective is
non-convex and the training data are non-identically independent distributed.
Moreover, our framework brings many insights into the design of update schemes
for decentralized optimization. As examples, we specify two update schemes and
show how they help improve communication efficiency. Specifically, the first
scheme alternates the number of local and global update steps. From our
analysis, the ratio of the number of local updates to that of decentralized SGD
trades off communication and computation. The second scheme is to periodically
shrink the length of local updates. We show that the decaying strategy helps
improve communication efficiency both theoretically and empirically.

decisions that undervalue the investment. In our work, a real options valuation
(ROV) framework is proposed to determine the optimal strategy for executing
multiple interacting options within a distribution network investment, to
mitigate the risk of financial losses in the presence of future uncertainties.
To demonstrate the characteristics of the proposed framework, we determine the
optimal strategy to economically justify the investment in residential
PV-battery systems for additional grid supply during peak demand periods. The
options to defer, and then expand, are considered as multi-stage compound
options, since the option to expand is a subsequent option of the former. These
options are valued via the least squares Monte Carlo method, incorporating
uncertainty over growing power demand, varying diesel fuel price, and the
declining cost of PV-battery technology as random variables. Finally, a
sensitivity analysis is performed to demonstrate how the proposed framework
responds to uncertain events. The proposed framework shows that executing the
interacting options at the optimal timing increases the investment value.

Distractors Generation for VQA (DG-VQA) focusing on generating challenging yet
meaningful distractors given the context image, question, and correct answer.
The DG-VQA task aims at generating distractors without ground-truth training
samples since such resources are rarely available. To tackle the DG-VQA
unsupervisedly, we propose Gobbet, a reinforcement learning(RL) based framework
that utilizes pre-trained VQA models as an alternative knowledge base to guide
the distractor generation process. In Gobbet, a pre-trained VQA model serves as
the environment in RL setting to provide feedback for the input multi-modal
query, while a neural distractor generator serves as the agent to take actions
accordingly. We propose to use existing VQA models' performance degradation as
indicators of the quality of generated distractors. On the other hand, we show
the utility of generated distractors through data augmentation experiments,
since robustness is more and more important when AI models apply to
unpredictable open-domain scenarios or security-sensitive applications. We
further conduct a manual case study on the factors why distractors generated by
Gobbet can fool existing models.

clinical decision-support system that helps them decide whether and when to
implant an artificial heart to a heart failure patient. I demonstrate that
physicians cannot draw on their decision-making experience by seeing only
patient data on paper. They are also confused by some fundamental premises upon
which ML operates. For example, physicians asked: Are ML predictions made based
on clinicians' best efforts? Is it ethical to make decisions based on previous
patients' collective outcomes? In the second case study, my collaborators and I
designed an intelligent text editor, with the goal of improving authors'
writing experience with NLP (Natural Language Processing) technologies. We
prototyped a number of generative functionalities where the system provides
phrase-or-sentence-level writing suggestions upon user request. When writing
with the prototype, however, authors shared that they need to ""see where the
sentence is going two paragraphs later"" in order to decide whether the
suggestion aligns with their writing; Some even considered adopting machine
suggestions as plagiarism, therefore ""is simply wrong"".

The communication channel presents an information-transfer bottleneck as the
sensors collect measurements at a much higher rate than what is feasible to

error at the centralized node, only a carefully selected subset of measurements

problem. However, when the criteria used to select measurements is both
monotone and submodular it allows the use of a greedy algorithm that is
guaranteed to be within $1-1/e\approx63\%$ of the optimum and has the critical
benefit of quadratic computational complexity. To illustrate this concept, we
derive the FIM criterion for different sensor types to which we apply FIM-based

different methods for studying finite-temperature quantum systems with tensor
networks. One approach is the ancilla method, which gives high-precision
results but scales poorly at low temperatures. The other method is the
minimally entangled typical thermal state (METTS) sampling algorithm which
scales better than the ancilla method at low temperatures and can be
parallelized, but requires many samples to converge to a precise result. Our
proposed hybrid of these two methods purifies physical sites in a small central
spatial region with partner ancilla sites, sampling the remaining sites using
the METTS algorithm. Observables measured within the purified cluster have much
lower sample variance than in the METTS approach, while sampling the sites
outside the cluster reduces their entanglement and the computational cost of
the algorithm. The sampling steps of the algorithm remain straightforwardly
parallelizable. The hybrid approach also solves an important technical issue
with METTS that makes it difficult to benefit from quantum number conservation.
By studying S=1 Heisenberg ladder systems, we find the hybrid method converges
more quickly than both the ancilla and METTS algorithms at intermediate
temperatures and for systems with higher entanglement.

learning in a test environment drawn from the environment distribution. Most
existing approaches focus on fixed exploration strategies, while the few that

approach that efficiently searches over a class of dynamic subgoal-based
exploration strategies. The algorithm adjusts a variety of levers -- the
locations of the subgoals, the length of each episode, and the number of
replications per trial -- in order to overcome the challenges of sparse

demonstrates that, when averaged across problem domains, the proposed algorithm
outperforms the meta-learning algorithm MAML by 19%, the hyperparameter tuning

In particular, the anomaly term including the explicit-chiral symmetry-breaking

we construct a linear sigma model for the scalar mesons of $q\bar{q}$ type

field and flow field, we found an emergence of magnetic flux and a strong
shearing motion between two opposite polarities near the following sunspot. The
magnetic flux and the average transverse field strength exhibited a decrease
before each eruption and reached the lowest point at the onset of each
eruption. By calculating the shearing and the emergence energy in the

reconnection between different loops was observed in H$\alpha$ images during
the occurrence of each flare. These results suggest that the emerging magnetic
flux and the shearing motion in the photosphere can inject the energy to the
sheared magnetic loops and the energy finally was released via magnetic
reconnection to power the solar flares.

emerges in the network, affecting a different set of sensors as time
progresses. The observations of the affected sensors are generated from a

increases with time, and that only the initial and the final size of the
anomaly are known by the decision maker. The goal is to detect the emergence of
the anomaly as quickly as possible while guaranteeing a sufficiently low
frequency of false alarm events. This detection problem is posed as a
stochastic optimization problem by using a delay metric that is based on the
worst possible path of the anomaly. A detection rule is proposed that is
asymptotically optimal as the mean time to false alarm goes to infinity.

  Training and Exploration with Decentralized Execution via Policy Distillation",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a booming area of artificial
intelligence. Many practical applications of DRL naturally involve more than
one collaborative learners, making it important to study DRL in a multi-agent
context. Previous research showed that effective learning in complex
multi-agent systems demands for highly coordinated environment exploration
among all the participating agents. Many researchers attempted to cope with
this challenge through learning centralized value functions. However, the
common strategy for every agent to learn their local policies directly often
fail to nurture strong inter-agent collaboration and can be sample inefficient
whenever agents alter their communication channels. To address these issues, we
propose a new framework known as centralized training and exploration with
decentralized execution via policy distillation. Guided by this framework and
the maximum-entropy learning technique, we will first train agents' policies
with shared global component to foster coordinated and effective learning.
Locally executable policies will be derived subsequently from the trained
global policies via policy distillation. Experiments show that our new
framework and algorithm can achieve significantly better performance and higher
sample efficiency than a cutting-edge baseline on several multi-agent DRL
benchmarks.

representing the individual time series of a different stock and each edge
between a pair of time series representing the absolute value of their Pearson
correlation, our start point is to compute the commute time matrix associated
with the weighted adjacency matrix of the network structures, where each
element of the matrix can be seen as the enhanced correlation value between
pairwise stocks. For each network, we show how the commute time matrix allows
us to identify a reliable set of dominant correlated time series as well as an
associated dominant probability distribution of the stock belonging to this
set. Furthermore, we represent each original network as a discrete dominant
Shannon entropy time series computed from the dominant probability
distribution. With the dominant entropy time series for each pair of financial
networks to hand, we develop a similarity measure based on the classical
dynamic time warping framework, for analyzing the financial time-varying
networks. We show that the proposed similarity measure is positive definite and
thus corresponds to a kernel measure on graphs. The proposed kernel bridges the
gap between graph kernels and the classical dynamic time warping framework for
multiple financial time series analysis. Experiments on time-varying networks

effectiveness of the proposed approach.

these two models, are investigated using analytical calculations as well as
Dynamic Triangulation Monte Carlo simulations of quasi-spherical vesicles.
While the spontaneous curvature model yields a monotonically decreasing sensing
curve as a function of vesicle radius, the curvature mismatch model results in
a non-monotonic sensing curve. We highlight the main differences in the
interpretation of the protein-related parameters in the two models. We further
propose that the spontaneous curvature model is appropriate for modeling
peripheral proteins employing the hydrophobic insertion mechanism, with minimal

demonstrate pronounced anisotropies in the inter-band coulomb repulsion

for the perovskite family of rare-earth nickelates (ReNiO3). From one aspect,
imparting bi-axial interfacial strains upon various lattice planes results in
extrinsic anisotropies in the abrupt orbital transitions of ReNiO3, and their
metal to insulator transition behaviors that elevates the transition
temperature beyond the existing merit. From the other aspect, the in-plane
orbital entropy associated to the in-plane symmetry of the NiO6 octahedron

  presence of variable binding","doctoral thesis",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This thesis deals with the specification and construction of syntax and
operational semantics of a programming language. We work with a general notion
of signature for specifying objects of a given category as initial objects in a
suitable category of models.This characterization, in the spirit of Initial
Semantics, gives a justification of the recursion principle. Languages with
variable binding, such as the pure lambda calculus, are monads on the category
of sets specified through the classical algebraic signatures. The first
extensions to syntaxes with equations that we consider are quotients of these
algebraic signatures. They allow, for example, to specify a binary commutative
operation. But some equations, such as associativity, seem to remain out of
reach. We thus introduce the notion of 2-signature, consisting in two parts: a
specification of operations through a usual signature as before, and a set of
equations among them. We identify the class of algebraic 2-signatures for which
the existence of the associated syntax is guaranteed. Finally, we takle the
specification of the operational semantics of a programming language such as
lambda calculus with beta-reduction. To this end, we introduce the notion of
reduction monad and their signatures, then we generalize them to get the notion
of operational monad.

data to collaboratively train a global model required by the model owner.
Federated learning thus addresses the privacy issues of traditional machine
learning. However, federated learning faces the energy constraints of the
workers and the high network resource cost due to the fact that a number of
global model transmissions may be required to achieve the target accuracy. To
address the energy constraint, a power beacon can be used that recharges energy
to the workers. However, the model owner may need to pay an energy cost to the
power beacon for the energy recharge. To address the high network resource
cost, the model owner can use a WiFi channel, called default channel, for the
global model transmissions. However, communication interruptions may occur due
to the instability of the default channel quality. For this, special channels
such as LTE channels can be used, but this incurs channel cost. As such, the
problem of the model owner is to decide amounts of energy recharged to the
workers and to choose channels used to transmit its global model to the workers
to maximize the number of global model transmissions while minimizing the
energy and channel costs. This is challenging for the model owner under the
uncertainty of the channel, energy and mobility states of the workers. In this
paper, we thus propose to employ the Deep Q-Network (DQN) that enables the
model owner to find the optimal decisions on the energy and the channels
without any a priori network knowledge. Simulation results show that the
proposed DQN always achieves better performance compared to the conventional
algorithms.

approach, which combines the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics for the time
evolution of nucleons and the JAM model to treat processes for $\Delta$
resonances and pions. As is known in general transport-code simulations, it is
difficult to treat Pauli blocking very precisely due to unphysical fluctuations
and additional smearing of the phase-space distribution function, when Pauli
blocking is treated in the standard method of JAM. We propose an improved
method in AMD+JAM to use the Wigner function precisely calculated in AMD as the
blocking probability. Different Pauli blocking methods are compared in
heavy-ion collisions of neutron-rich nuclei,
${}^{132}\mathrm{Sn}+{}^{124}\mathrm{Sn}$, at 270 MeV/nucleon. With the more
accurate method, we find that Pauli blocking is stronger, in particular for the
neutron in the final state in $NN \rightarrow N \Delta$ and $ \Delta \to N\pi$,

applied in large-scale image retrieval due to its excellent efficiency. Most
supervised deep hashing methods have similar loss designs with embedding
learning, while quantizing the continuous high-dim feature into compact binary
space. We argue that the existing deep hashing schemes are defective in two
issues that seriously affect the performance, i.e., bit independence and bit
balance. The former refers to hash codes of different classes should be
independent of each other, while the latter means each bit should have a
balanced distribution of +1s and -1s. In this paper, we propose a novel
supervised deep hashing method, termed Hadamard Codebook based Deep Hashing
(HCDH), which solves the above two problems in a unified formulation.
Specifically, we utilize an off-the-shelf algorithm to generate a binary
Hadamard codebook to satisfy the requirement of bit independence and bit
balance, which subsequently serves as the desired outputs of the hash functions
learning. We also introduce a projection matrix to solve the inconsistency
between the order of Hadamard matrix and the number of classes. Besides, the
proposed HCDH further exploits the supervised labels by constructing a
classifier on top of the outputs of hash functions. Extensive experiments

  Classification","8 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Implicit discourse relation classification is of great importance for
discourse parsing, but remains a challenging problem due to the absence of
explicit discourse connectives communicating these relations. Modeling the
semantic interactions between the two arguments of a relation has proven useful
for detecting implicit discourse relations. However, most previous approaches
model such semantic interactions from a shallow interactive level, which is
inadequate on capturing enough semantic information. In this paper, we propose
a novel and effective Semantic Graph Convolutional Network (SGCN) to enhance
the modeling of inter-argument semantics on a deeper interaction level for
implicit discourse relation classification. We first build an interaction graph
over representations of the two arguments, and then automatically extract
in-depth semantic interactive information through graph convolution.
Experimental results on the English corpus PDTB and the Chinese corpus CDTB
both demonstrate the superiority of our model to previous state-of-the-art
systems.

Technol",,,,"cs.NI eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nowadays unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being widely applied to a wealth
of civil and military applications. Robust and high-throughput wireless
communication is the crux of these UAV applications. Yet, air-to-ground links
suffer from time-varying channels induced by the agile mobility and dynamic
environments. Rate adaptation algorithms are generally used to choose the
optimal data rate based on the current channel conditions. State-of-the-art
approaches leverage physical layer information for rate adaptation, and they
work well under certain conditions. However, the above protocols still have
limitation under constantly changing flight states and environments for
air-to-ground links. To solve this problem, we propose StateRate, a
state-optimized rate adaptation algorithm that fully exploits the
characteristics of UAV systems using a hybrid deep learning model. The key
observation is that the rate adaptation strategy needs to be adjusted according
to motion-dependent channel models, which can be reflected by flight states. In
this work, the rate adaptation protocol is enhanced with the help of the
on-board sensors in UAVs. To make full use of the sensor data, we introduce a
learning-based prediction module by leveraging the internal state to
dynamically store temporal features under variable flight states. We also
present an online learning algorithm by employing the pre-trained model that
adapts the rate adaptation algorithm to different environments. We implement
our algorithm on a commercial UAV platform and evaluate it in various
environments. The results demonstrate that our system outperforms the
best-known rate adaptation algorithm up to 53% in terms of throughput when the
velocity is 2-6~m/s.

consumed not only by humans but also by machines. Existing image processing
methods only optimize for better human perception, yet the resulting images may
not be accurately recognized by machines. This can be undesirable, e.g., the
images can be improperly handled by search engines or recommendation systems.
In this work, we examine simple approaches to improve machine recognition of
processed images: optimizing the recognition loss directly on the image
processing network or through an intermediate input transformation model.
Interestingly, the processing model's ability to enhance recognition quality
can transfer when evaluated on models of different architectures, recognized
categories, tasks and training datasets. This makes the methods applicable even
when we do not have the knowledge of future recognition models, e.g., when
uploading processed images to the Internet. We conduct experiments on multiple
image processing tasks paired with ImageNet classification and PASCAL VOC
detection as recognition tasks. With these simple yet effective methods,
substantial accuracy gain can be achieved with strong transferability and
minimal image quality loss. Through a user study we further show that the
accuracy gain can transfer to a black-box cloud model. Finally, we try to
explain this transferability phenomenon by demonstrating the similarities of

which plays an essential role in many real-world applications. Although having
enjoyed the merits of deep learning frameworks from the generic object
detectors, pedestrian detection is still a very challenging task due to heavy
occlusion and highly crowded group. Generally, the conventional detectors are
unable to differentiate individuals from each other effectively under such a
dense environment. To tackle this critical problem, we propose an
attribute-aware pedestrian detector to explicitly model people's semantic
attributes in a high-level feature detection fashion. Besides the typical
semantic features, center position, target's scale and offset, we introduce a
pedestrian-oriented attribute feature to encode the high-level semantic
differences among the crowd. Moreover, a novel attribute-feature-based
Non-Maximum Suppression~(NMS) is proposed to distinguish the person from a
highly overlapped group by adaptively rejecting the false-positive results in a
very crowd settings. Furthermore, a novel ground truth target is designed to
alleviate the difficulties caused by the attribute configuration and extremely
class imbalance issues during training. Finally, we evaluate our proposed
attribute-aware pedestrian detector on two benchmark datasets including
CityPersons and CrowdHuman. The experimental results show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods at a large margin on pedestrian detection.

a classifier. As is well known, the (Fisher) information in an unclassified
feature with unknown class label is less (considerably less for weakly
separated classes) than that of a classified feature which has known class
label. Hence assuming that the labels of the unclassified features are randomly
missing or their missing-label mechanism is simply ignored, the expected error
rate of a classifier formed from a partially classified sample is greater than
that if the sample were completely classified. We propose to treat the labels
of the unclassified features as missing data and to introduce a framework for
their missingness in situations where these labels are not randomly missing. An
examination of several partially classified data sets in the literature
suggests that the unclassified features are not occurring at random but rather
tend to be concentrated in regions of relatively high entropy in the feature
space. Here in the context of two normal classes with a common covariance
matrix we consider the situation where the missingness of the labels of the
unclassified features can be modelled by a logistic model in which the
probability of a missing label for a feature depends on its entropy. Rather
paradoxically, we show that the classifier so formed from the partially
classified sample may have smaller expected error rate that that if the sample
were completely classified.

typically the best. We further analyze why regularization may help
generalization in RL from four perspectives - sample complexity, reward

The starting point is a bipartite structure created by coupled dielectric

a resonant mode if the CT-symmetry is present, while it is suppressed once the
symmetry is violated due to permittivity changes of the defect resonator

investigate its several scaling regimes in the limit $N\to \infty$. When the
degree of asymmetry is fixed as $N\to \infty$, the number of real eigenvalues
is $O(\sqrt{N})$, and in the bulk of the real spectrum $t_i=O(N)$, while on
approaching the spectral edges the non-orthogonality is weaker:
$t_i=O(\sqrt{N})$. In both cases the corresponding JDFs, after appropriate
rescaling, coincide with those found in the earlier studied case of fully
asymmetric (Ginibre) matrices. A different regime of weak asymmetry arises when
a finite fraction of $N$ eigenvalues remain real as $N\to \infty$. In such a
regime eigenvectors are weakly non-orthogonal, $t=O(1)$, and we derive the
associated JDF, finding that the characteristic tail ${\cal P}(z,t)\sim t^{-2}$
survives for arbitrary weak asymmetry. As such, it is the most robust feature
of the condition number density for real eigenvalues of asymmetric matrices.

algorithms are developed for high-quality simulations of the quantized
Dirac-Maxwell theory based strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SFQED) and
relativistic quantum plasmas (RQP) phenomena. The Lagrangian density of an
interacting bispinor-gauge fields theory is constructed in a conjugate real
fields form. The canonical symplectic form and canonical equations of this
field theory are obtained by the general Hamilton's principle on cotangent
bundle. Based on discrete exterior calculus, the gauge field components are
discreted to form a cochain complex, and the bispinor components are naturally
discreted on a staggered dual lattice as combinations of differential forms.
With pull-back and push-forward gauge covariant derivatives, the discrete
action is gauge invariant. A well-defined discrete canonical Poisson bracket
generates a semi-discrete lattice canonical field theory (LCFT), which admits
the canonical symplectic form, unitary property, gauge symmetry and discrete
Poincar\'e subgroup. The Hamiltonian splitting method, Cayley transformation
and symmetric composition technique are introduced to construct a class of
high-order numerical schemes. These schemes involve two degenerate fermion
flavors and are locally unconditional stable, which also preserve the geometric
structures. Equipped with statistically quantization-equivalent ensemble models
of the Dirac vacuum and non-trivial plasma backgrounds, the schemes are
expected to have excellent performance in secular simulations of relativistic
quantum effects. The algorithms are verified in detail by numerical energy
spectra. Real-time LCFT simulations are successfully implemented for the
nonlinear Schwinger mechanism induced $e$-$e^+$ pairs creation and vacuum Kerr
effect, which open a new door toward high-quality simulations in SFQED and RQP.

singular perturbation theory to reduce the order of systems modeled by ordinary
differential equations and the computational burden in their simulation. In
particular, we apply the proposed methodology to a simplified power system
scenario comprised of three inverters in parallel---controlled as
synchronverters---connected to an ideal grid. We demonstrate by time-domain
simulations that the reduced and decoupled system obtained with the proposed
approach accurately represents the dynamics of the original system because it
preserves the non-linear dynamics. This shows the efficiency of our technique
even for transient perturbations and has relevant applications including the
simplification of the Lyapunov stability assessment or the design of non-linear
controllers for large-scale power systems.

privacy of individuals whose sensitive information is contained in the dataset.
The information privacy model protects the privacy of an individual by using a
noisy channel, called privacy channel, to filter out most information of the
individual from the query's output.
  This paper studies how to construct privacy channels, which is challenging
since it needs to evaluate the maximal amount of disclosed information of each
individual contained in the query's output, called individual channel capacity.
Our main contribution is an interesting result which can transform the problem
of evaluating a privacy channel's individual channel capacity, which equals the
problem of evaluating the capacities of an infinite number of channels, into
the problem of evaluating the capacities of a finite number of channels. This
result gives us a way to utilize the results in the information theory to
construct privacy channels. As some examples, it is used to construct several
basic privacy channels, such as the random response privacy channel, the
exponential privacy channel and the Gaussian privacy channel, which are
respective counterparts of the random response mechanism, the exponential
mechanism and the Gaussian mechanism of differential privacy.

the capabilities of explainers for convolutional deep neural networks in an
extreme situation: a setting in which humans and networks fundamentally
disagree. Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks that
deliberately modify input samples to mislead a neural network's classification,
without affecting how a human observer interprets the input. Our goal with this
contribution is to evaluate explainers by investigating whether they can
identify adversarially attacked regions of an image. In particular, we
quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the capability of three popular
explainers of classifications -- classic salience, guided backpropagation, and
LIME -- with respect to their ability to identify regions of attack as the
explanatory regions for the (incorrect) prediction in representative examples

of the pieces of music on the underlying corpus and, consecutively, to train
and evaluate a classifier to automatically identify genres. In this paper, we
apply two very fast algorithms enabling us to experiment on large and diverse
corpora. Thus, we are able to find patterns with strong discrimination power
that can be used in various applications. We carried out experiments on a
corpus containing over 40,000 MIDI files annotated with at least one genre. The

real-world-size music collections.

to first choose a gauge for solving the gravitational field equations and later

gravitational back-reaction of the matter fields, which becomes important at
low temperatures. We study in detail the properties of these solitons under
variation of the back-reaction strength via tuning the gravitational constant.
In particular, the depletion fraction of the particle number density at the
core of the solitons is carefully investigated. In agreement with the
probe-limit analysis, the depletion fraction shows the same qualitative
behavior as in Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) theory, even if the back-reaction is
included. We find that the depletion decreases with increasing back-reaction
strength. Moreover, the inclusion of back-reaction enables us to obtain the
effective energy density of solitons within holography, which together with an
evaluation of the surface tension leads to a simple physical explanation for
the snake instability of dark solitons.

data. There have been recent attempts at using pre-trained encoders to deal
with this issue. Pre-trained encoder provides representation of the input text
which is then fed to task-specific layers for classification. The entire
network is fine-tuned on the labeled data from the target task. Unfortunately,
a low-resource biomedical task often has too few labeled instances for
satisfactory fine-tuning. Also, if the label space is large, it contains few or
no labeled instances for majority of the labels. Most biomedical tagging
systems treat labels as indexes, ignoring the fact that these labels are often
concepts expressed in natural language e.g. `Appearance of lesion on brain
imaging'. To address these issues, we propose constructing extra labeled
instances using label-text (i.e. label's name) as input for the corresponding
label-index (i.e. label's index). In fact, we propose a number of strategies
for manufacturing multiple artificial labeled instances from a single label.
The network is then fine-tuned on a combination of real and these newly
constructed artificial labeled instances. We evaluate the proposed approach on
an important low-resource biomedical task called \textit{PICO annotation},
which requires tagging raw text describing clinical trials with labels
corresponding to different aspects of the trial i.e. PICO (Population,
Intervention/Control, Outcome) characteristics of the trial. Our empirical
results show that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art
performance for PICO annotation with very significant improvements over

repressing target RNA molecules. Competition to bind miRNAs tends in turn to
correlate their targets, establishing effective RNA-RNA interactions that can
influence expression levels, buffer fluctuations and promote signal
propagation. Such a potential has been characterized mathematically for small
motifs both at steady state and \red{away from stationarity}. Experimental
evidence, on the other hand, suggests that competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA)
crosstalk is rather weak. Extended miRNA-RNA networks could however favour the
integration of many crosstalk interactions, leading to significant large-scale
effects in spite of the weakness of individual links. To clarify the extent to
which crosstalk is sustained by the miRNA interactome, we have studied its
emergent systemic features in silico in large-scale miRNA-RNA network
reconstructions. We show that, although generically weak, system-level
crosstalk patterns (i) are enhanced by transcriptional heterogeneities, (ii)
can achieve high-intensity even for RNAs that are not co-regulated, (iii) are
robust to variability in transcription rates, and (iv) are significantly
non-local, i.e. correlate weakly with miRNA-RNA interaction parameters.
Furthermore, RNA levels are generically more stable when crosstalk is
strongest. As some of these features appear to be encoded in the network's
topology, crosstalk may functionally be favoured by natural selection. These
results suggest that, besides their repressive role, miRNAs mediate a weak but
resilient and context-independent network of cross-regulatory interactions that
interconnect the transcriptome, stabilize expression levels and support
system-level responses.

to failures and connectivity disruptions, the very set of service replicas (or
servers) and their roles in the computation may have to be reconfigured over
time. To provide the desired level of consistency and availability to
applications running on top of these servers, the clients of the service should
be able to reach some form of agreement on the system configuration. We observe
that this agreement is naturally captured via a lattice partial order on the
system states. We propose an asynchronous implementation of reconfigurable
lattice agreement that implies elegant reconfigurable versions of a large class
of lattice abstract data types, such as max-registers and conflict detectors,
as well as popular distributed programming abstractions, such as atomic
snapshot and commit-adopt.

convergence result, in the case of correlated sensor L\'evy noises, the
nonlinear filtering of the slow part is shown to approximate that of the

spectrogram of an audio signal with the same time-frequency resolutions, number
of filters, and dimensionality reduction scale. According to the constant-Q
transform, good features can be extracted from audio signals if the low
frequency bands are processed with high frequency resolution filters and the
high frequency bands with high time resolution filters. In the spectrogram of a
mixture of singing voices and music signals, there is usually more information
about the voice in the low frequency bands than the high frequency bands. These
raise the need for processing each part of the spectrogram differently. In this
paper, we propose a multi-band multi-resolution fully convolutional neural
network (MBR-FCN) for singing voice separation. The MBR-FCN processes the
frequency bands that have more information about the target signals with more
filters and smaller dimentionality reduction scale than the bands with less
information. Furthermore, the MBR-FCN processes the low frequency bands with
high frequency resolution filters and the high frequency bands with high time

with very few parameters achieves better singing voice separation performance

post-linear metric density of this formalism is used in order to determine the
post-linear metric tensor in the exterior of a compact source of matter. The
metric tensor is given in harmonic coordinates and in terms of STF multipoles.
The post-linear metric coefficients are associated with an integration

These studies are a requirement for further investigations in the theory of

with traditional mechanisms. One solution has been proposed recently by
carefully designing a reward scheme for the nodes who have invited others.

Several countermeasures have recently been proposed, with different features

of solutions, designed to protect the individual user, are not suitable for
efficiently protecting a corporate network, especially against insiders. In
this paper, we propose a network-based approach to detect and identify
crypto-clients activities by solely relying on the network traffic, even when

generated by three major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Monero, and Bytecoin,
considering both the normal traffic and the one shaped by a VPN. Then, we
propose Crypto-Aegis, a Machine Learning (ML) based framework built over the
results of our investigation, aimed at detecting cryptocurrencies related
activities, e.g., pool mining, solo mining, and active full nodes. Our solution
achieves a striking 0.96 of F1-score and 0.99 of AUC for the ROC, while
enjoying a few other properties, such as device and infrastructure

that our approach, supported by its excellent results, pave the way for further

to reconstruct the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of cosmic
structures. Estimation of the expected performance of the experiment, in terms
of predicted constraints on cosmological parameters, has so far relied on
different methodologies and numerical implementations, developed for different
observational probes and for their combination. In this paper we present
validated forecasts, that combine both theoretical and observational expertise
for different cosmological probes. This is presented to provide the community
with reliable numerical codes and methods for Euclid cosmological forecasts. We
describe in detail the methodology adopted for Fisher matrix forecasts, applied
to galaxy clustering, weak lensing and their combination. We estimate the
required accuracy for Euclid forecasts and outline a methodology for their
development. We then compare and improve different numerical implementations,
reaching uncertainties on the errors of cosmological parameters that are less
than the required precision in all cases. Furthermore, we provide details on
the validated implementations that can be used by the reader to validate their
own codes if required. We present new cosmological forecasts for Euclid. We
find that results depend on the specific cosmological model and remaining
freedom in each setup, i.e. flat or non-flat spatial cosmologies, or different
cuts at nonlinear scales. The validated numerical implementations can now be
reliably used for any setup. We present results for an optimistic and a
pessimistic choice of such settings. We demonstrate that the impact of
cross-correlations is particularly relevant for models beyond a cosmological
constant and may allow us to increase the dark energy Figure of Merit by at
least a factor of three.

most challenging issues for spoken language understanding (SLU) systems as
well. As syntactic ambiguity is intertwined with issues regarding prosody and
semantics, the computational approach toward speech intention identification is
expected to benefit from the observations of the human language processing
mechanism. In this regard, we address the task with attentive recurrent neural
networks that exploit acoustic and textual features simultaneously and reveal
how the modalities interact with each other to derive sentence meaning.
Utilizing a speech corpus recorded on Korean scripts of syntactically ambiguous
utterances, we revealed that co-attention frameworks, namely multi-hop
attention and cross-attention, show significantly superior performance in
disambiguating speech intention. With further analysis, we demonstrate that the
computational models reflect the internal relationship between auditory and

operating systems are properly patched for the security guarantees of the
hypervisor. However, none of them pay enough attentions to the performance
improvements, which results in two noticeable performance issues. First, such
security patches exacerbate the problem that the execution paths of the guest
page table (de)allocations become extremely long, which would consequently
increase the latencies of process creations and exits. Second, the patches
introduce many additional IOTLB flushes, leading to extra IOTLB misses, and the
misses would have negative impacts on I/O performance of all peripheral
devices. In this paper, we propose PiBooster, a novel lightweight approach for
improving the performance in page table management. First, PiBooster shortens
the execution paths of the page table (de)allocations by the PiBooster cache,
which maintains dedicated buffers for serving page table (de)allocations.
Second, PiBooster eliminates the additional IOTLB misses with a fine-grained
validation scheme, which performs page table and DMA validations separately,
instead of doing both together. We implement a prototype on Xen with Linux as
the guest kernel. We do small modifications on Xen (166 SLoC) and Linux kernel
(350 SLoC). We evaluate the I/O performance in both micro and macro ways. The
micro experiment results indicate that PiBooster is able to completely
eliminate the additional IOTLB flushes in the workload-stable environments, and
effectively reduces (de)allocation time of the page table by 47% on average.
The macro benchmarks show that the latencies of the process creations and exits
are expectedly reduced by 16% on average. Moreover, the SPECINT,lmbench and
netperf results indicate that PiBooster has no negative performance impacts on
CPU computation, network I/O, and disk I/O.

parsing trees and/or grammar rule pieces. We call such 'labels' as compound
structured labels which require a hard work for training. SSMRBL is an
incremental learning process that can learn more than one representation, which
is an appropriate solution for dealing with the scarce of labeled training data
in the age of big data and with the heavy workload of learning compound
structured labels. We also present a typical example of SSMRBL, regarding
behavior learning in form of a grammatical approach towards domain-based
multiple text summarization (DBMTS). DBMTS works under the framework of
rhetorical structure theory (RST). SSMRBL includes two representations: text
embedding (for representing information contained in the texts) and grammar
model (for representing parsing as a behavior). The first representation was
learned as embedded digital vectors called impacts in a low dimensional space.
The grammar model was learned in an iterative way. Then an automatic
domain-oriented multi-text summarization approach was proposed based on the two
representations discussed above. Experimental results on large-scale Chinese

We present the fundamental lower bound of the temperature of a radiatively
cooled object on earth surfaces under general conditions, including
non-radiative heat transfer, and the upper bound of the net radiative power
density of a radiative cooler as a function of temperature. We derive the ideal
spectral emissivities that can realize such bounds and, contrary to common
belief, find that the ideal emission window is different from 8 to 13 um and
forms disjointed sets of wavelengths, whose width diminishes at lower
temperatures. We show that ideal radiative coolers with perfect thermal
insulation against conduction and convection have a steady-state temperature of
243.6 K in summer and 180.5 K in winter, much below previously measured values.
We also provide the ideal emission window for a single-band emitter and show
that this window should be much narrower than that of previous designs if the
objective is to build a radiative freezer that can operate in summer. We
provide a general guideline for designing spectral emissivity to achieve the
maximum temperature drop or the maximum net radiative power density.

decade. The idea is to learn a metric space induced from a normed vector space
on which data from different classes are well separated. Different measures of
the separation thus lead to various designs of the objective function in the
metric learning model. One classical metric is the Mahalanobis distance, where
a linear transformation matrix is designed and applied on the original dataset
to obtain a new subspace equipped with the Euclidean norm. The kernelized
version has also been developed, followed by Multiple-Kernel learning models.
In this paper, we consider metric learning to be the identification of the best
kernel function with respect to a high class separability in the corresponding
metric space. The contribution is twofold: 1) No pairwise computations are
required as in most metric learning techniques; 2) Better flexibility and lower
computational complexity is achieved using the CLAss-Specific (Multiple) Kernel
- Metric Learning (CLAS(M)K-ML). The proposed techniques can be considered as a
preprocessing step to any kernel method or kernel approximation technique. An
extension to a hierarchical learning structure is also proposed to further
improve the classification performance, where on each layer, the CLASMK is
computed based on a selected ""marginal"" subset and feature vectors are
constructed by concatenating the features from all previous layers.

  Learning Multi-Agent Systems",,,,,"cs.LG cs.GT cs.MA cs.SY econ.TH eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the problem of resource congestion control for
competing online learning agents. On the basis of non-cooperative game as the
model for the interaction between the agents, and the noisy online mirror
ascent as the model for rational behavior of the agents, we propose a novel
pricing mechanism which gives the agents incentives for sustainable use of the
resources. Our mechanism is distributed and resource-centric, in the sense that
it is done by the resources themselves and not by a centralized instance, and
that it is based rather on the congestion state of the resources than the
preferences of the agents. In case that the noise is persistent, and for
several choices of the intrinsic parameter of the agents, such as their
learning rate, and of the mechanism parameters, such as the learning rate of -,
the progressivity of the price-setters, and the extrinsic price sensitivity of
the agents, we show that the accumulative violation of the resource constraints
of the resulted iterates is sub-linear w.r.t. the time horizon. Moreover, we
provide numerical simulations to support our theoretical findings.

filters by index should be pruned. Since only an intersection of the voted
filters is pruned, the compression rate is limited. This work proposes a method
called Directed-Weighting Group Lasso (DWGL), which enforces an index-wise
incremental (directed) coefficient on the filterlevel group lasso items, so
that the low index filters getting high activation tend to be kept while the
high index ones tend to be pruned. When using DWGL, much fewer filters are
retained during the voting process and the compression rate can be boosted. The

achieved a 75.34% compression rate on ResNet-56 with a 0.94% error increment,

analysis of high-quality broad energy band (0.8-200 keV) data in three
different spectral states: high/soft, low/very-hard, and transitional state.
The broad band spectra can be described in general as the sum of thermal
Comptonization and reflection due to illumination of an optically-thick
accretion disc. During the high/soft state, blackbody emission is generated
from the accretion disc and the surface of the neutron star. This emission,
measured at a temperature of kTbb ~1.2 keV, is then Comptonized by a thick
corona with an electron temperature of ~2.5 keV. For the transitional and
low/very-hard state, the spectra are successfully explained with emission from
a double Comptonizing corona. The first component is described by thermal
Comptonization of seed disc/neutron-star photons (kTbb ~1.2 keV) by a cold
corona cloud with kT e ~8-10 keV, while the second one originates from lower
temperature blackbody photons (kTbb~0.1 keV) Comptonized by a hot corona
(kTe~35 keV). Finally, from NuSTAR observations, there is evidence that the
source is a new clocked burster. The average time between two successive X-ray
bursts corresponds to ~7.9 ks and ~4.0 ks when the persistent emission
decreases by a factor ~2, moving from very hard to transitional state. The
accretion rate and the decay time of the X-ray bursts longer than ~30 s suggest
that the thermonuclear emission is due to mixed H/He burning triggered by
thermally unstable He ignition.

elliptical slice sampling (ESS). Adapted to the linear setting, ESS allows for
rejection-free sampling, because intersections of ellipses and domain
boundaries have closed-form solutions. The key idea of HDR is to decompose the
integral into easier-to-compute conditional probabilities by using a sequence
of nested domains. Remarkably, it allows for direct computation of the
logarithm of the integral value and thus enables the computation of extremely
small probability masses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our tailored

presence of both real-valued inputs (power input to each engine in addition to
the direction of thrust vector) and discrete variables (number of active
engines). Each engine can be switched on/off independently and ""optimal""
operating power of each engine depends on the available solar power, which
depends on the distance from the Sun. Application of the Composite Smooth
Control (CSC) framework to a heliocentric fuel-optimal trajectory optimization
from the Earth to the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is demonstrated, which
presents a new approach to deal with multiple-engine problems. Operation of
engine clusters with 4, 6, 10 and even 20 engines of the same type can be
optimized. Moreover, engine clusters with different/mixed electric engines are
considered with either 2, 3 or 4 different types of engines. Remarkably, the
CSC framework allows us 1) to reduce the original multi-point boundary-value
problem to a two-point boundary-value problem (TPBVP), and 2) to solve the
resulting TPBVPs using a single-shooting solution scheme and with a random
initialization of the missing costates. While the approach we present is a
continuous neighbor of the discontinuous extremals, we show that the
discontinuous necessary conditions are satisfied in the asymptotic limit. We
believe this is the first indirect method to accommodate a multi-mode control
of this level of complexity with realistic engine performance curves. The
results are interesting and promising for dealing with a large family of such
challenging multi-mode optimal control problems.

to implement a logical non-Clifford gate. Consequently, it is important to
understand codes that implement such gates transversally. In this paper, we
adopt an algebraic approach to characterize all stabilizer codes for which
transversal $T$ and $T^{-1}$ gates preserve the codespace. Our Heisenberg
perspective reduces this to a finite geometry problem that translates to the
design of certain classical codes. We prove three corollaries: (a) For any
non-degenerate $[[ n,k,d ]]$ stabilizer code supporting a physical transversal
$T$, there exists an $[[ n,k,d ]]$ CSS code with the same property; (b)
Triorthogonal codes are the most general CSS codes that realize logical
transversal $T$ via physical transversal $T$; (c) Triorthogonality is necessary
for physical transversal $T$ on a CSS code to realize the logical identity. The
main tool we use is a recent efficient characterization of certain diagonal
gates in the Clifford hierarchy (arXiv:1902.04022). We refer to these gates as
Quadratic Form Diagonal (QFD) gates. Our framework generalizes all existing
code constructions that realize logical gates via transversal $T$. We provide
several examples and briefly discuss connections to decreasing monomial codes,
pin codes, generalized triorthogonality and quasitransversality. We partially
extend these results towards characterizing all stabilizer codes that support
transversal $\pi/2^{\ell}$ $Z$-rotations. In particular, using Ax's theorem on
residue weights of polynomials, we provide an alternate characterization of
logical gates induced by transversal $\pi/2^{\ell}$ $Z$-rotations on a family
of quantum Reed-Muller codes. We also briefly discuss a general approach to
analyze QFD gates that might lead to a characterization of all stabilizer codes
that support any given physical transversal $1$- or $2$-local diagonal gate.

heavy-ion collisions. The pion spectrum is calculated within the
self-consistent Hartree approximation. General expressions are derived for
cross-covariances of the number of various particle species in the pion gas of
an arbitrary isospin composition. The behavior of the cross-variances is
analyzed for the temperature approaching from above the maximal critical
temperature of the Bose-Einstein condensation for the pion species $a=\pm,0$,
i.e. for $T>\max T_{\rm cr}^a$. It is shown that in case of the system with
equal averaged numbers of isospin species, the variance of the charge,
$Q=N_{+}-N_{-}$, diverges at $T\to T_{\rm cr}=T_{\rm cr}^a$, whereas variances
of the total particle number, $N=N_{+} + N_{-} + N_{0}$, and of a relative
abundance of charged and neutral pions, $G=(N_{+}+N_{-})/2 - N_{0}$, remain
finite in the critical point. Then fluctuations are studied in the pion gas
with small isospin imbalance $0<|G|\ll N$ and $0<|Q|\ll N$\, and shifts of the
effective masses, chemical potentials and values of critical temperatures are
calculated for various pion species, and the highest critical temperature,
$\mbox{max}T_{\rm cr}^{{a}}$ is found, above which the pion system exists in
the non-condensed phase. Various pion cross variances are calculated for
$T>\mbox{max}T_{\rm cr}^{{a}}$, which prove to be strongly dependent on the
isospin composition of the system, whereas the variances of $N$ and $G$ are
found to be independent on the isospin imbalance up to the term linear in $G/N$

widely used for searching norm-bounded perturbations that cause the inputs of
neural networks to be misclassified. This paper takes a deeper look at these
methods and explains the effect of different hyperparameters (i.e., optimizer,
step size and surrogate loss). We introduce the concept of MultiTargeted
testing, which makes clever use of alternative surrogate losses, and explain
when and how MultiTargeted is guaranteed to find optimal perturbations.
Finally, we demonstrate that MultiTargeted outperforms more sophisticated
methods and often requires less iterative steps than other variants of PGD
found in the literature. Notably, MultiTargeted ranks first on MadryLab's
white-box MNIST and CIFAR-10 leaderboards, reducing the accuracy of their MNIST
model to 88.36% (with $\ell_\infty$ perturbations of $\epsilon = 0.3$) and the
accuracy of their CIFAR-10 model to 44.03% (at $\epsilon = 8/255$).
MultiTargeted also ranks first on the TRADES leaderboard reducing the accuracy

properties. Upon increasing temperature the PNIPAM polymer chain undergoes a
reversible coil-to-globule transition at ~305K, which is reflected by a volume
phase transition in cross-linked architectures, such as microgels, valuable for
many practical applications. The addition of a cosolvent is a simple method to
tune the transition temperature according to the specific purpose. In this
study, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to explore the solution
behavior of a PNIPAM chain in a mixture of water and ethanol, acting as
cosolvent, at low alcohol concentration. Our simulations reproduce the
occurrence of the coil-to-globule transition of the polymer chain at 289 K, a
temperature lower than that measured in water, in full agreement with
experimental findings. By monitoring the temperature evolution of structural
and dynamical properties of the PNIPAM-water-ethanol ternary system, we detect
a localization of ethanol molecules at the polymer interface, mainly due to
interactions between isopropyl and ethyl groups. We observe that the transition
occurs without a release of adsorbed ethanol molecules, but with a loss of
water molecules from the surrounding of PNIPAM hydrophobic moieties that
favours the aggregation of ethanol molecules close to the polymer. Our results
support the idea that both the decreased chemical potential of water in the
bulk of the mixture and the competition between water and ethanol molecules in
the interactions with the polymer play a driving role in the transition.

to simple models. In the Bayesian framework, this can be pursued by restricting
the model structure and prior to favor interpretable models. Fundamentally,
however, interpretability is about users' preferences, not the data generation
mechanism; it is more natural to formulate interpretability as a utility
function. In this work, we propose an interpretability utility, which
explicates the trade-off between explanation fidelity and interpretability in
the Bayesian framework. The method consists of two steps. First, a reference
model, possibly a black-box Bayesian predictive model which does not compromise
accuracy, is fitted to the training data. Second, a proxy model from an
interpretable model family that best mimics the predictive behaviour of the
reference model is found by optimizing the interpretability utility function.
The approach is model agnostic -- neither the interpretable model nor the
reference model are restricted to a certain class of models -- and the
optimization problem can be solved using standard tools. Through experiments on
real-word data sets, using decision trees as interpretable models and Bayesian
additive regression models as reference models, we show that for the same level
of interpretability, our approach generates more accurate models than the
alternative of restricting the prior. We also propose a systematic way to
measure stability of interpretabile models constructed by different
interpretability approaches and show that our proposed approach generates more
stable models.

domains due to their impressive capabilities. These models are typically
composed of a large number of 2D convolutional (Conv2D) layers with numerous
trainable parameters. To reduce the complexity of a network, compression
techniques can be applied. These methods typically rely on the analysis of
trained deep learning models. However, in some applications, due to reasons
such as particular data or system specifications and licensing restrictions, a
pre-trained network may not be available. This would require the user to train
a CNN from scratch. In this paper, we aim to find an alternative
parameterization to Conv2D filters without relying on a pre-trained
convolutional network. During the analysis, we observe that the effective rank
of the vectorized Conv2D filters decreases with respect to the increasing depth
in the network, which then leads to the implementation of the Depthwise
Convolutional Eigen-Filter (DeCEF) layer. Essentially, a DeCEF layer is a low
rank version of the Conv2D layer with significantly fewer trainable parameters
and floating point operations (FLOPs). The way we define the effective rank is
different from the previous work and it is easy to implement in any deep
learning frameworks. To evaluate the effectiveness of DeCEF, experiments are
conducted on the benchmark datasets CIFAR-10 and ImageNet using various network
architectures. The results have shown a similar or higher accuracy and
robustness using about 2/3 of the original parameters and reducing the number
of FLOPs to 2/3 of the base network, which is then compared to the

  Optimization","41 pages",,,,"math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a novel stochastic extra-step quasi-Newton method is developed
to solve a class of nonsmooth nonconvex composite optimization problems. We
assume that the gradient of the smooth part of the objective function can only
be approximated by stochastic oracles. The proposed method combines general
stochastic higher order steps derived from an underlying proximal type
fixed-point equation with additional stochastic proximal gradient steps to
guarantee convergence. Based on suitable bounds on the step sizes, we establish
global convergence to stationary points in expectation and an extension of the
approach using variance reduction techniques is discussed. Motivated by
large-scale and big data applications, we investigate a stochastic
coordinate-type quasi-Newton scheme that allows to generate cheap and tractable
stochastic higher order directions. Finally, the proposed algorithm is tested
on large-scale logistic regression and deep learning problems and it is shown
that it compares favorably with other state-of-the-art methods.

evidence for the odderon, the charge conjugation $C = -1$ counterpart of the
$C= +1$ pomeron. Last year results of the TOTEM collaboration suggest that the
odderon exchange can be responsible for a disagreement of theoretical
calculations and the TOTEM data for elastic proton-proton scattering. Here we
present recent studies for central exclusive production (CEP) of $\phi \phi$
pairs in proton-proton collisions. We consider the pomeron-pomeron fusion to
$\phi \phi$ ($\mathbb{P}\mathbb{P} \to \phi \phi$) through the continuum
processes, due to the $\hat{t}$- and $\hat{u}$-channel reggeized $\phi$-meson,
photon, and odderon exchanges, as well as through the $s$-channel resonance
process ($\mathbb{P}\mathbb{P} \to f_{2}(2340) \to \phi \phi$). This $f_{2}$
state is a candidate for a tensor glueball. The amplitudes for the processes
are formulated within the tensor-pomeron and vector-odderon approach. Some
model parameters are determined from the comparison to the WA102 experimental
data. The odderon exchange is not excluded by the WA102 data for high $\phi
\phi$ invariant masses. The measurement of large $M_{\phi \phi}$ or
$\rm{Y_{diff}}$ events at the LHC would therefore suggest presence of the
odderon exchange.

By contrast, recent modeling of the widespread gaps in protoplanetary disks

Jupiter-mass planets at large separations. The thermal emission from such
lower-mass planets is negligible at optical and near-infrared wavelengths,
leaving only their weak signals in reflected light. Planets do not scatter
enough light at these large orbital distances, but there is a natural way to
enhance their reflecting area. Each of the four giant planets in our solar
system hosts swarms of dozens of irregular satellites, gravitationally captured
planetesimals that fill their host planets' spheres of gravitational influence.
What we see of them today are the leftovers of an intense collisional
evolution. At early times, they would have generated bright circumplanetary
debris disks. We investigate the properties and detectability of such irregular
satellite disks (ISDs) following models for their collisional evolution from
Kennedy and Wyatt 2011. We find that ISD brightnesses peak in the $10-100$ AU
range probed by ALMA, and can render planets detectable over a wide range of
parameters with upcoming high-contrast instrumentation. We argue that future
instruments with wide fields of view could simultaneously characterize the
atmospheres of known close-in planets, and reveal the population of long-period

for the diffraction limited image of a particle or dot viewed through a medium
containing density gradients that includes the effect of various experimental
parameters such as the particle depth, viewing direction and f-number. Using
the model we show that non-linearities in the density gradient field lead to
blurring of the particle/dot image. This blurring amplifies the effect of image
noise on the centroid estimation process, leading to an increase in the CRLB
and a decrease in the measurement precision. The ratio of position
uncertainties of a dot in the reference and gradient images is a function of
the ratio of the dot diameters and dot intensities. We term this parameter the
Amplification Ratio (AR), and we propose a methodology for estimating the
position uncertainties in tracking-based BOS measurements. The theoretical
predictions of the particle/dot position estimation variance from the CRLB are
compared to ray tracing simulations with good agreement. The uncertainty
amplification is also demonstrated on experimental BOS images of flow induced
by a spark discharge, where we show that regions of high amplification ratio

cross-validation (CV) is used asa standard approach in quantifying the
generalisation performance of a statistical model. A directapplication of CV in
time-series leads to the loss of serial correlations, a requirement of
preserving anynon-stationarity and the prediction of the past data using the
future data. In this work, we proposea meta-algorithm called reconstructive
cross validation (rCV ) that avoids all these issues. At first,k folds are
formed with non-overlapping randomly selected subsets of the original
time-series. Then,we generate k new partial time-series by removing data points
from a given fold: every new partialtime-series have missing points at random
from a different entire fold. A suitable imputation or asmoothing technique is
used to reconstruct k time-series. We call these reconstructions
secondarymodels. Thereafter, we build the primary k time-series models using
new time-series coming fromthe secondary models. The performance of the primary
models are evaluated simultaneously bycomputing the deviations from the
originally removed data points and out-of-sample (OSS) data.Full
cross-validation in time-series models can be practiced with rCV along with
generating learning curves.

elaborate the main objective of each group, and further review typical GAN

a red component of system B at $\sim$-7000$\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ that can be
decomposed into several narrow absorption lines (NALs). First, we confirm that
the most likely cause for the equivalent width variations of the absorption
lines (at least for system B) in J1208+0355 is the ionization change scenario
as a response to the changes in the ionization continuum according to the
following observational factors: (1) coordinated multiple absorption lines
strengthening; (2) the continuum flux shows an obvious weakening. Second, we
find line-locking phenomena from the blended NALs within system B, indicating
that these outflow clouds are driven by a radiative force caused by resonance
lines. The above two research aspects convincingly reveal that the BAL outflows
of J1208+0355 are affected by the background radiation energy. Therefore, we
infer that the kinematic shift shown in system A may be produced by actual
line-of-sight acceleration of the outflow clouds, which is driven by radiation
pressure from the background light source.

hot electron spin currents excited by an ultrashort laser pulse propagate from
the first ferromagnetic layer through the spacer reaching the second magnetic

this spin current exerts a torque on magnetic moments in the second
ferromagnet. Since this torque is acting only within the sub-ps timescale, it
excites coherent high-frequency magnons as recently demonstrated in
experiments. Here, we calculate the temporal shape of the hot electron spin
currents using the superdiffusive transport model and simulate the response of
the magnetic system to the resulting ultrashort spin-transfer torque pulse by
means of atomistic spin-dynamics simulations. Our results confirm that the
acting spin-current pulse is short enough to excite magnons with frequencies
beyond 1 THz, a frequency range out of reach for current induced spin-transfer
torques. We demonstrate the formation of thickness dependent standing spin

Maximum Probability (MP) Theorem shown in the current paper. In this
probabilistic framework, a model is defined as an event in the probability
space, and a model or the associated event -- either the true underlying model
or the parameterized model -- have a quantified probability measure. This
quantification of a model's probability measure is derived by the MP Theorem,
in which we have shown that an event's probability measure has an upper-bound
given its conditional distribution on an arbitrary random variable. Through
this alternative framework, the notion of model parameters is encompassed in
the definition of the model or the associated event. Therefore, this framework
deviates from the conventional approach of assuming a prior on the model
parameters. Instead, the regularizing effects of assuming prior over parameters
is seen through maximizing probabilities of models or according to information
theory, minimizing the information content of a model. The probability of a
model in our framework is invariant to reparameterization and is solely
dependent on the model's likelihood function. Also, rather than maximizing the
posterior in a conventional Bayesian setting, the objective function in our
alternative framework is defined as the probability of set operations (e.g.
intersection) on the event of the true underlying model and the event of the
model at hand. Our theoretical framework, as a derivation of MP theorem, adds
clarity to probabilistic learning through solidifying the definition of
probabilistic models, quantifying their probabilities, and providing a visual
understanding of objective functions.

self-supervised model takes benefit from a generic time-related task, by
learning to estimate the time interval between pairs of scans acquired from the

irregularly sampled data, (iii) is tolerant to poor registration, and (iv) does
not rely on additional annotations. This novel method learns a representation
that focuses on progression specific information only, which can be transferred
to other types of longitudinal problems. We transfer the learnt representation
to a clinically highly relevant task of predicting the onset of an advanced
stage of age-related macular degeneration within a given time interval based on
a single OCT scan. The boost in prediction accuracy, in comparison to a network
learned from scratch or transferred from traditional tasks, demonstrates that
our pretrained self-supervised representation learns a clinically meaningful

diverse array of topics, such as literature, science, mathematics and even
cooking are preserved. However, following a change to the Japanese writing
system in 1900, Kuzushiji has not been included in regular school curricula.
Therefore, most Japanese natives nowadays cannot read books written or printed
just 150 years ago. Museums and libraries have invested a great deal of effort
into creating digital copies of these historical documents as a safeguard
against fires, earthquakes and tsunamis. The result has been datasets with
hundreds of millions of photographs of historical documents which can only be
read by a small number of specially trained experts. Thus there has been a
great deal of interest in using Machine Learning to automatically recognize
these historical texts and transcribe them into modern Japanese characters.
Nevertheless, several challenges in Kuzushiji recognition have made the
performance of existing systems extremely poor. To tackle these challenges, we
propose KuroNet, a new end-to-end model which jointly recognizes an entire page
of text by using a residual U-Net architecture which predicts the location and
identity of all characters given a page of text (without any pre-processing).
This allows the model to handle long range context, large vocabularies, and
non-standardized character layouts. We demonstrate that our system is able to

advanced indirect method, the Unified Trigonometrization Method (UTM), to a
Mars Science Laboratory type entry problem. The objective is to maximize the
parachute deployment altitude for a free-time, fixed-final-velocity entry
trajectory. For entry vehicles, in addition to the bank angle that is
characterized by bang-bang control profiles, there are typically three state
path constraints that have to be considered, namely, the dynamic pressure, heat
rate and g-load. This study shows that the UTM enables simultaneous
regularization of the bang-bang control and satisfaction of the state path
constraints. Two scenarios with and without state path constraints are
considered. The results obtained using the UTM for both of these cases are
found to be in excellent agreement with a direct optimization method.
Furthermore, an interesting feature emerges in the optimal control profile of
the UTM during the initial high-altitude part of the resulting optimal

  overlap with arXiv:1804.00118",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Style transfer methods produce a transferred image which is a rendering of a
content image in the manner of a style image. We seek to understand how to
improve style transfer.
  To do so requires quantitative evaluation procedures, but the current
evaluation is qualitative, mostly involving user studies. We describe a novel
quantitative evaluation procedure. Our procedure relies on two statistics: the
Effectiveness (E) statistic measures the extent that a given style has been
transferred to the target, and the Coherence (C) statistic measures the extent
to which the original image's content is preserved. Our statistics are
calibrated to human preference: targets with larger values of E (resp C) will
reliably be preferred by human subjects in comparisons of style (resp.
content).
  We use these statistics to investigate the relative performance of a number
of Neural Style Transfer(NST) methods, revealing several intriguing properties.
Admissible methods lie on a Pareto frontier (i.e. improving E reduces C or vice
versa). Three methods are admissible: Universal style transfer produces very
good C but weak E; modifying the optimization used for Gatys' loss produces a
method with strong E and strong C; and a modified cross-layer method has
slightly better E at strong cost in C. While the histogram loss improves the E
statistics of Gatys' method, it does not make the method admissible.
Surprisingly, style weights have relatively little effect in improving EC
scores, and most variability in the transfer is explained by the style itself
(meaning experimenters can be misguided by selecting styles).

model the system by introducing an additional thermal reservoir coupled to the

not be robust for ""in-the-wild"" data with poses up to 90{\deg}. In order to
increase robustness to an ensemble of factors of variations (e.g. head pose or

replaced by a Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer that uses an ensemble of experts
instead of a single one. The weights of this mixture can be learned as gating
functions to jointly learn the experts and the corresponding weights. In this
paper, we propose to use tree-structured gates which allows a hierarchical
weighting of the experts (Tree-MoE). We investigate the use of Tree-MoE layers
in different contexts in the frame of face alignment with cascaded regression,
firstly for emphasizing relevant, more specialized feature extractors depending

not fulfill its instruction, HIGhER learns to output a new directive that
matches the agent trajectory, and it relabels the episode with a positive
reward. To do so, HIGhER learns to map a state into an instruction by using
past successful trajectories, which removes the need to have external expert
interventions to relabel episodes as in vanilla HER. We show the efficiency of
our approach in the BabyAI environment, and demonstrate how it complements
other instruction following methods.

$10^{7.32}$ to $10^{9.84}$ $\rm M_{sun}$, and the Eddington ratios $R_{\rm
edd}$ vary from $10^{-4.93}$ to $10^{0.37}$, suggesting that young radio AGNs
have various accretion activities and not all are accreting at high accretion
rate. Our young radio sources generally follow the evolutionary trend towards
large-scale radio galaxies with increasing linear size and decreasing accretion
rate in the radio power - linear size diagram. The radio properties of low
luminosity young radio AGNs with low $R_{\rm edd}$ are discussed. The line
width of [O III] $\lambda5007$ core ($\sigma_{\rm [O III]}$) is found to be a
good surrogate of stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\ast}$. The radio
luminosity $L_{\rm 5GHz}$ correlates strongly with [O III] core luminosity
$L_{\rm [O III]}$, suggesting that radio activity and accretion are closely
related in young radio sources. We find one object that can be defined as
narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s), representing a population of young AGNs
both with young jet and early accretion activity. The optical variabilities of
15 quasars with multi-epoch spectroscopy were investigated. Our results show

decomposition approach based on SVD, namely depth-wise decomposition, for
expanding regular convolutions into depthwise separable convolutions while
maintaining high accuracy. We show our approach can be further generalized to
the multi-channel and multi-layer cases, based on Generalized Singular Value
Decomposition (GSVD) [59]. We conduct thorough experiments with the latest
ShuffleNet V2 model [47] on both random synthesized dataset and a large-scale
image recognition dataset: ImageNet [10]. Our approach outperforms channel
decomposition [73] on all datasets. More importantly, our approach improves the
Top-1 accuracy of ShuffleNet V2 by ~2%.

a function of reconstructed energy and direction for each observation. We used
that model, and tested all analysis methods that are supported by ctools,

methods that are comparable to those used by the H.E.S.S. Collaboration. For
all analysis methods, we found a good agreement between the ctools results and

importance of distinguishing between (at least) two different types of

comparison of images in CNN latent spaces.
  Firstly, we study the impact of the distance metrics, comparing performances
obtained with different metrics: the minimal Euclidean distance (MED), the
minimal cosine distance (MCD), and the residue of the sparse coding
reconstruction (RSCR). These metrics are applied using features extracted from
five different CNN architectures, namely ResNet18, AlexNet, VGG16, InceptionV3
and DenseNet201. We use the specific vehicle re-identification dataset VeRi to
fine-tune these CNNs and evaluate results. In overall, independently of the CNN
used, MCD outperforms MED, commonly used in the literature. These results are
confirmed on other vehicle retrieval datasets. Secondly, we extend the
state-of-the-art image-to-track process (I2TP) to a track-to-track process
(T2TP). The three distance metrics are extended to measure distance between
tracks, enabling T2TP. We compared T2TP with I2TP using the same CNN models.
Results show that T2TP outperforms I2TP for MCD and RSCR. T2TP combining
DenseNet201 and MCD-based metrics exhibits the best performances, outperforming
the state-of-the-art I2TP-based models. Finally, experiments highlight two main
results: i) the impact of metric choice in vehicle re-identification, and ii)
T2TP improves the performances compared to I2TP, especially when coupled with
MCD-based metrics.

the same carrier frequency, which yields narrowly focused only angle dependent
beampattern. In contrast, in the frequency-diverse-array (FDA) radar signals
from antenna array are generally transmitted at linearly increasing frequencies
that yields range, time, and angle dependent beampattern. Reported literature
on FDA radar missed the contribution of path-differences in the signal model
due to the antenna array elements, which may lead to misleading results. In
this work, incorporating missed path-differences, the signal model of FDA radar
is corrected. Using the corrected signal model, it is shown that the
instantaneous beampattern depends on the number of transmit antenna and average
beampattern depends on the product of frequency-offset and pulse-duration.
Moreover, to illuminate the desired region-of-interest for longer dwell time,
discrete-Fourier-transform based low-complexity algorithm is proposed. In
contrast to the conventional FDA radar's 'S' shaped beampattern, the
beampattern of the proposed algorithm changes linearly with range. Simulation

however assume that a landmark detector, which has already learned a structured

available. Under this setting, our main idea boils down to adapting the given
pre-trained network to the target object categories in a fully unsupervised
manner. To this end, our method uses the pre-trained network as a core which
remains frozen and does not get updated during training, and learns, in an
unsupervised manner, only a projection matrix to perform the adaptation to the
target categories. By building upon an existing structured representation
learned in a supervised manner, the optimization problem solved by our method
is much more constrained with significantly less parameters to learn which
seems to be important for the case of unsupervised learning. We show that our
method surpasses fully unsupervised techniques trained from scratch as well as

to resolve the paradox and explain gaps in the economic value theory in the
evaluation of economic decisions, the subjective utility of the expected
outcomes, and risk aversion as observed in the game of the St. Petersburg
Paradox. In this paper, we use the concept of the relative net utility to
resolve the St. Petersburg Paradox. Because the net utility concept is able to
explain both behavioral economics and the St. Petersburg Paradox, it is deemed
to be a universal approach to handling utility. This paper shows how the
information content of the notion of net utility value allows us to capture a
broader context of the impact of a decision's possible achievements. It
discusses the necessary conditions that the utility function has to conform to
avoid the paradox. Combining these necessary conditions allows us to define the
theorem of indifference in the evaluation of economic decisions and to present
the role of the relative net utility and net utility polarity in a value
rational decision-making process.

perm-selective membranes has been extensively researched in recent years for
understanding the fundamental mechanisms of transport and developing efficient
applications from electrochemistry to sample analysis and separation.
Predominant mechanisms responsible for OLC include surface conduction,
convection by electro-osmotic flow, and electro-osmotic instability depending
on input parameters such as surface charge and geometric constrictions. This
work studies how a network of microchannels in a non-uniform array, which
mimicks a natural pore configuration, can contribute to OLC. To this end,
micro/nanofluidic devices are fabricated with arrays of parallel microchannels
with non-uniform size distributions. All cases maintain the same surface and
bulk conduction to allow probing the sensitivity only by the non-uniformity of
the channels. Both experimental and theoretical current-voltage relations
demonstrate that OLCs increase with increasing non-uniformity. Furthermore, the
visualization of internal recirculating flows indicates that the non-uniform
arrays induce flow loops across the network enhancing advective transport.
These evidences confirm a new driving mechanism of OLC, inspired by natural
micro/nanoporous materials with random geometric structure. Therefore, this
result can advance not only the fundamental understanding of
nanoelectrokinetics but also the design rule of engineering applications of
electrochemical membrane.

has previously been analyzed using ""thermodynamic"" arguments based on the

avoid assumptions about the equation of state, using only jump relations for
conservation of mass and momentum, but not energy. We give a new short proof
for non-existence of pure (no contact) triple shocks, recovering a result of
Serre. For MR with a zero-circulation but nonzero-density-jump contact we show
that the incident shock must be normal. Nonexistence without contacts
generalizes to two or more incident shocks if we assume all shocks are
compressive. The sign of circulation across the contact has previously been
controlled with entropy arguments, showing the post-Mach-stem velocity is
generally smaller. We give a kinematic proof assuming compressive shocks and
another condition, for example backward incident shocks, or a weak form of the
Lax condition. We also show that for 2+2 interactions (two ""upper"" shocks with
clockwise flow meeting two ""lower"" shocks with counterclockwise flow in a
single point) the circulation sign can generally not be controlled. For
$\gamma$-law pressure we show 2+2 interactions without contact must be either
symmetric or antisymmetric, with symmetry favored at low Mach number and low
shock strength. For full potential flow instead of the Euler equations we
surprisingly find, contrary to folklore and prior results for other models,
that pure triple shocks without contacts are possible, even for $\gamma$-law
pressure with $1<\gamma<3$.

producer because of its impact on seed weight (yield), and critically
influences seed vigor and other quality characteristics. During seed
development, the inner mesocarp layer of the pericarp (hull) transitions in
color from white to black as the seed matures. The maturity assessment process
involves the removal of the exocarp of the hull and visually categorizing the
mesocarp color into varying color classes from immature (white, yellow, orange)
to mature (brown, and black). This visual color classification is time
consuming because the exocarp must be manually removed. In addition, the visual
classification process involves human assessment of colors, which leads to
large variability of color classification from observer to observer. A more
objective, digital imaging approach to peanut maturity is needed, optimally
without the requirement of removal of the hull's exocarp. This study examined
the use of a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) process to determine pod maturity with
intact pericarps. The HSI method leveraged spectral differences between mature
and immature pods within a classification algorithm to identify the mature and
immature pods. The results showed a high classification accuracy with
consistency using samples from different years and cultivars. In addition, the
proposed method was capable of estimating a continuous-valued, pixel-level

can be utilized in seed quality research. This new method solves issues of

and rationales separately. Question and image is used as input to train answer

in the rationale prediction network. As rationale is conditioned on the correct
answer, it is based on the assumption that we can solve Visual Question
Answering task without any error - which is over ambitious. Moreover, such an
approach makes both answer and rationale prediction two completely independent
VQA tasks rendering cognition task meaningless. In this paper, we seek to
address these issues by proposing an end-to-end trainable model which considers
both answers and their reasons jointly. Specifically, we first predict the
answer for the question and then use the chosen answer to predict the
rationale. However, a trivial design of such a model becomes non-differentiable

are trapped in dynamic magnetic structures. In addition, electrons are
accelerated stochastically which is a slower process that yields lower maximum
energies. The combined effect of these two processes determines the overall
electron acceleration. With appropriate turbulence parameters, we find that

that covers most of previous causality-based fairness notions, namely the
path-specific counterfactual fairness (PC fairness). Based on that, we propose
a general method in the form of a constrained optimization problem for bounding
the path-specific counterfactual fairness under all unidentifiable situations.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the correctness and
effectiveness of our method.

block in ASR systems and other applications such as hearing aids, smartphones

perform poorly when the user-item interactions/ratings are highly scarce. To
address this, we propose a learning framework that improves collaborative
filtering with a synthetic feedback loop (CF-SFL) to simulate the user
feedback. The proposed framework consists of a ""recommender"" and a ""virtual
user"". The ""recommender"" is formulated as a CF model, recommending items
according to observed user preference. The ""virtual user"" estimates rewards
from the recommended items and generates a \emph{feedback} in addition to the
observed user preference. The ""recommender"" connected with the ""virtual user""
constructs a closed loop, that recommends users with items and imitates the
\emph{unobserved} feedback of the users to the recommended items. The synthetic
feedback is used to augment the observed user preference and improve
recommendation results. Theoretically, such model design can be interpreted as
inverse reinforcement learning, which can be learned effectively via rollout
(simulation). Experimental results show that the proposed framework is able to
enrich the learning of user preference and boost the performance of existing
collaborative filtering methods on multiple datasets.

example is text data, where a text may be seen as a sequence of words. Another
example is clickstream data, where a data instance is a sequence of clicks made
by a visitor to a website. This is also common for data originating in the
domains of speech processing and computational biology. Using such data with
statistical learning techniques can often prove to be cumbersome since most of
them only allow fixed-length feature vectors as input. In casting the data to
fixed-length feature vectors to suit these techniques, we lose the convenience,
and possibly information, a good sequence-based representation can offer. The
framework of rational kernels partly addresses this problem by providing an
elegant representation for sequences, for algorithms that use kernel functions.
In this report, we take a comprehensive look at this framework, its various
extensions and applications. We start with an overview of the core ideas, where
we look at the characterization of rational kernels, and then extend our
discussion to extensions, applications and use at scale. Rational kernels
represent a family of kernels, and thus, learning an appropriate rational
kernel instead of picking one, suggests a convenient way to use them; we
explore this idea in our concluding section. Rational kernels are not as
popular as the many other learning techniques in use today; however, we hope
that this summary effectively shows that not only is their theory
well-developed, but also that various practical aspects have been carefully
studied over time.

five years. Methods: Electronic searches were conducted in April 2019 using
PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, and CINAHL to identify peer
reviewed studies published in English during the past five years that
specifically addressed the development, validation, or recalibration of
delirium prediction models in adult ICU populations. Data were extracted using
CHARMS checklist elements for systematic reviews of prediction studies,
including the following characteristics: study design, participant descriptions
and recruitment methods, predicted outcomes, a priori candidate predictors,
sample size, model development, model performance, study results,
interpretation of those results, and whether the study included missing data.
Results: Twenty studies featuring 26 distinct prediction models were included.
Model performance varied greatly, as assessed by AUROC (0.68-0.94), specificity
(56.5%-92.5%), and sensitivity (59%-90.9%). Most models used data collected
from a single time point or window to predict the occurrence of delirium at any
point during hospital or ICU admission, and lacked mechanisms for providing
pragmatic, actionable predictions to clinicians. Conclusions: Although most ICU
delirium prediction models have relatively good performance, they have limited
applicability to clinical practice. Most models were static, making predictions
based on data collected at a single time-point, failing to account for
fluctuating conditions during ICU admission. Further research is needed to
create clinically relevant dynamic delirium prediction models that can adapt to
changes in individual patient physiology over time and deliver actionable
predictions to clinicians.
