reconstruction of the initial condition of a quasilinear parabolic equation
from the measurements of both Dirichlet and Neumann data on the boundary of a
bounded domain. Although this problem is highly nonlinear, we do not require an
initial guess of the true solution. The key in our method is the derivation of
a boundary value problem for a system of coupled quasilinear elliptic equations
whose solution is the vector function of the spatially dependent Fourier
coefficients of the solution to the governing parabolic equation. We solve this
problem by an iterative method. The global convergence of the system is
rigorously established using a Carleman estimate. Numerical examples are
presented.

topology optimization of structures made of discrete geometric components using
the geometry projection method. Practical structures made of geometric shapes
such as bars and plates typically exhibit low volume fractions with respect to
the volume of the design region they occupy. To maintain an accurate analysis
and to ensure well-defined sensitivities in the geometry projection, it is
required that the element size is smaller than the smallest dimension of each
component. For low-volume-fraction structures, this leads to finite element
meshes with very large numbers of elements. To improve the efficiency of the
analysis and optimization, we propose a strategy to adaptively refine the mesh
and reduce the number of elements by having a finer mesh on the geometric
components, and a coarser mesh away from them. The refinement indicator stems
very naturally from the geometry projection and is thus straightforward to
implement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AMR method by
performing topology optimization for the design of minimum-compliance and
stress-constrained structures made of bars and plates.

the stability and chromatic numbers of a graph. This notion is a central aspect
in the celebrated theory of perfect graphs, and is further and deeply developed
in the context of the Lov\'asz theta function and its equivalent
characterizations and variants. The main achievement of this paper is the
introduction of a new family of norms, providing upper bounds for the stability
number, that are obtained from duality from the norms motivated by Hoffman's
lower bound for the chromatic number and which achieve the (complementary)
Lov\'asz theta function at their optimum. As a consequence, our norms make it
formal that Hoffman's bound for the chromatic number and the Delsarte-Hoffman
ratio bound for the stability number are indeed dual. Further, we show that our
new bounds strengthen the convex quadratic bounds for the stability number
studied by Luz and Schrijver, and which achieve the Lov\'asz theta function at
their optimum. One of the key observations regarding weighted versions of these
bounds is that, for any upper bound for the stability number of a graph which
is a positive definite monotone gauge function, its gauge dual is a lower bound
on the fractional chromatic number, and conversely. Our presentation is
elementary and accessible to a wide audience.

Although glare research has existed for more than 50 years, all current glare
metrics have accuracy limitations, especially in open-plan offices with low
lighting levels. Thus, it is crucial to develop a new method to predict glare
more accurately. This paper is the first to adopt Machine Learning (ML)
approaches in the prediction of glare. This research aims to demonstrate the
validity of this approach by comparing the accuracy of the new ML model for
open-plan offices (OGE) to the accuracy of the existing glare metrics using
local dataset. To utilize and test this approach, Post-Occupancy Evaluation
(POE) and High Dynamic Range (HDR) images were collected from 80 occupants
(n=80) in four different open-plan offices in Brisbane, Australia.
Consequently, various multi-region luminance values, luminance, and glare
indices were calculated and examined as input features to train ML models. The
accuracy of the ML model was compared to the accuracy of 24 indices which were
also evaluated using a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to
identify the best cutoff values (thresholds) for each index in open-plan
configurations. Results showed that the ML approach could predict glare with an
accuracy of 83.8% (0.80 true positive rate and 0.86 true negative rate), which
outperformed the accuracy of the previously developed glare metrics. OGE is
applicable for open-plan office situations with low vertical illuminance (200
to 600 lux). However, ML models can be trained with more substantial datasets
to achieve global model.

problems: the presence of inter-subject variations in facial expression
recognition dataset and impure expressions posed by human subjects. In this
paper we present a novel Human-to-Animation conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (HA-GAN) to overcome these two problems by using many (human faces) to
one (animated face) mapping. Specifically, for any given input human expression
image, our HA-GAN transfers the expression information from the input image to
a fixed animated identity. Stylized animated characters from the Facial
Expression Research Group-Database (FERGDB) are used for the generation of
fixed identity. By learning this many-to-one identity mapping function using
our proposed HA-GAN, the effect of inter-subject variations can be reduced in
Facial Expression Recognition(FER). We also argue that the expressions in the
generated animated images are pure expressions and since FER is performed on
these generated images, the performance of facial expression recognition is
improved. Our initial experimental results on the state-of-the-art datasets
show that facial expression recognition carried out on the generated animated

operating temperatures in structural applications. Herein, we present a phase
field model of solute segregation to IBs that separate matrix and precipitate
phases in binary alloys. The proposed modeling framework is capable of
capturing bulk thermodynamics and interfacial free energies, while also
accounting for various mass transport mechanisms. Analytical equilibrium
solutions of one-dimensional systems are presented, and excess IB quantities
are evaluated independent of the Gibbs dividing surface convention. With the
aid of the parallel tangent construction, IB segregation isotherms are
established in terms of the alloy composition and the model parameters
describing the free energy functions. Under the regular solution approximation,
computational studies elucidating the dependence of the IB energy and
segregation levels on temperature and free energy model parameters are
presented. We show that the model is consistent with the Gibbs adsorption
equation; therefore, it is possible to compare the adsorption behavior
predicted by the model parameters with experiments and atomistic simulations.
Future work on extending the model to ternary alloys, and incorporating the
effect of elastic interactions on IB segregation is expected.

We show that $H_r(P)\subseteq H_f(P)$ in a number of special cases. In contrast

by out-of-plane deformations on charge distributions and transport on graphene.
A review of a continuum model for electrons using the Dirac formalism is
complemented with elasticity theory to represent strain fields. The resulting
model is cast in terms of scalar and pseudo-magnetic fields that control
electron dynamics. Two distinct geometries, a bubble, and a fold are chosen to
represent the most commonly observed deformations in experimental settings. It
is shown that local charge accumulation regions appear in deformed areas, with
a peculiar charge distribution that favors the occupation of one sublattice
only. This unique phenomenon that allows distinguishing each carbon atom in the
unit cell, is the manifestation of a sublattice symmetry broken phase. For
specific parameters, resonant states appear in localized charged regions, as
shown by the emergence of discrete levels in band structure calculations. These
findings are presented in terms of intuitive pictures that exploit analogies
with confinement produced by square barriers. In addition, electron currents
through strained regions are spatially separated into their valley components,
making possible the manipulation of electrons with different valley indices.
The degree of valley filtering (or polarization) for a specific system can be
controlled by properly designing the strained area. The comparison between
efficiencies of filters built with this type of geometries identifies extended
deformations as better valley filters. A proposal for their experimental
implementations as a component of devices and a discussion for potential
observation of novel physics in strained structures are presented at the end of
the article.

variants of a robust Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, crUCB. Using
regret derived from only the underlying stochastic rewards, both variants of
crUCB achieve $\mathcal{O} (\sqrt{KT\log T})$ regret for small enough
contamination proportions. Our simulations assume small horizons, reflecting
the newly explored setting of bandits in education. We show that in certain
adversarial regimes crUCB not only outperforms algorithms designed for
stochastic (UCB1) and adversarial (EXP3) bandits but also those that have ""best
of both worlds"" guarantees (EXP3++ and TsallisInf) even when our constraint on
the proportion of contaminated rewards is broken.

data-driven diagnosis methods. The classification performance of many machine
learning methods relies on the quality of training data. Unknown faults, for
example faults not represented in training data, can be detected using, for
example, anomaly classifiers. However, mapping these unknown faults to an
actual location in the real system is a non-trivial problem. In model-based
diagnosis, physical-based models are used to create residuals that isolate
faults by mapping model equations to faulty system components. Developing
sufficiently accurate physical-based models can be a time-consuming process.
Hybrid modeling methods combining physical-based methods and machine learning
is one solution to design data-driven residuals for fault isolation. In this
work, a set of neural network-based residuals are designed by incorporating
physical insights about the system behavior in the residual model structure.
The residuals are trained using only fault-free data and a simulation case
study shows that they can be used to perform fault isolation and localization
of unknown faults in the system.

self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), motivated by the small scale problems. For
self interactions of SIDM being compatible from dwarf to cluster scales,
velocity-dependent self interactions mediated by a light scalar $\phi$ is
considered. To fermionic SIDM $\Psi$, the main annihilation mode $\Psi
\bar{\Psi} \to \phi \phi$ is a $p -$wave process. The thermal transition of
SIDM $\rightleftarrows \phi \rightleftarrows$ standard model (SM) particles in
the early universe sets a lower bound on couplings of $\phi$ to SM particles,
which has been excluded by DM direct detections, and here we consider SIDM in
the thermal equilibrium via millicharged DM. For $m_\phi >$ twice millicharged
DM mass, $\phi$ could decay quickly and avoid excess energy injection to the
big bang nucleosynthesis. Thus, the $\phi -$SM particle couplings could be very
tiny and evade DM direct detections. The picture of weakly interacting massive
particle (WIMP)-nucleus scattering with contact interactions fails for
SIDM-nucleus scattering with a light mediator, and a method is explored in this
paper, with which a WIMP search result can be converted into the hunt for SIDM

applicability, SL has been substantially applied in a variety of decision
making in the area of cybersecurity, opinion models, trust models, and/or

in predicting uncertain opinions in real-world dynamic network data mainly in
three-fold: (1) a lack of scalability to deal with a large-scale network; (2)
limited capability to handle heterogeneous topological and temporal
dependencies among node-level opinions; and (3) a high sensitivity with
conflicting evidence that may generate counterintuitive opinions derived from
the evidence. In this work, we proposed a novel deep learning (DL)-based
dynamic opinion inference model while node-level opinions are still formalized
based on SL meaning that an opinion has a dimension of uncertainty in addition
to belief and disbelief in a binomial opinion (i.e., agree or disagree). The
proposed DL-based dynamic opinion inference model overcomes the above three
limitations by integrating the following techniques: (1) state-of-the-art DL
techniques, such as the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and the Gated
Recurrent Units (GRU) for modeling the topological and temporal heterogeneous
dependency information of a given dynamic network; (2) modeling conflicting
opinions based on robust statistics; and (3) a highly scalable inference
algorithm to predict dynamic, uncertain opinions in a linear computation time.
We validated the outperformance of our proposed DL-based algorithm (i.e.,
GCN-GRU-opinion model) via extensive comparative performance analysis based on

addressed molecular two-layer ANNs with binary inputs and arbitrary weights. In
prior work using fractional coding, a simple molecular perceptron that computes
sigmoid of scaled weighted sum of the inputs was presented where the inputs and
the weights lie between [-1, 1]. Even for computing the perceptron, the prior
approach suffers from two major limitations. First, it cannot compute the

Second, many machine learning applications require the coefficients to be

such numbers cannot be handled by the prior perceptron using fractional coding.
This paper makes four contributions. First molecular perceptrons that can
handle arbitrary weights and can compute sigmoid of the weighted sums are
presented. Thus, these molecular perceptrons are ideal for regression
applications and multi-layer ANNs. A new molecular divider is introduced and is

that mid-tropospheric vertical velocities in extratropical precipitation
extremes strengthen overall in simulations of 21st-century climate change. For
each extreme event, we solve the quasi-geostrophic omega equation to decompose
this strengthening into different physical contributions. We first consider a
dry decomposition in which latent heating is treated as an external forcing of
upward motion. Much of the positive contribution to upward motion from
increased latent heating is offset by negative contributions from increases in
dry static stability and changes in the horizontal length scale of vertical
velocities. However, taking changes in latent heating as given is a limitation
when the aim is to understand changes in precipitation, since latent heating
and precipitation are closely linked. Therefore, we also perform a moist
decomposition of the changes in vertical velocities in which latent heating is
represented through a moist static stability. In the moist decomposition,
changes in moist static stability play a key role and contributions from other
factors such as changes in the depth of the upward motion increase in
importance. While both dry and moist decompositions are self-consistent, the
moist dynamical perspective has greater potential to give insights into the
causes of the dynamical contributions to changes in precipitation extremes in

requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n/ \log{n}}\,)$ rounds. Our results therefore completely
resolve (up to a small polylogarithmic factor) the complexity of the
single-source reachability problem for a wide range of diameters. Furthermore,
we show that when $D = 1$, it is even possible to get a $3$-approximation for
the all-pairs shortest path problem (for directed unweighted graphs) in just
$2$ rounds. We also prove a stronger lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n}\,)$ for
the single-source shortest path problem for unweighted directed graphs that
holds even when the diameter of the underlying network is $2$. As far as we
know this is the first lower bound that achieves $\Omega(\sqrt{n}\,)$ for this
problem.

Motivated by applications to recommendation systems and other scenarios with
query-limited access to vast amounts of data, we propose a new rigorous
algorithmic framework for a standard formulation of this problem as a
submodular maximization subject to a linear (knapsack) constraint. Our
framework is based on augmenting all partial Greedy solutions with the best
additional item. It can be instantiated with negligible overhead in any model
of computation, which allows the classic \greedy algorithm and its variants to
be implemented. We give such instantiations in the offline (Greedy+Max),
multi-pass streaming (Sieve+Max) and distributed (Distributed+Max) settings.
Our algorithms give ($1/2-\epsilon$)-approximation with most other key
parameters of interest being near-optimal. Our analysis is based on a new set
of first-order linear differential inequalities and their robust approximate
versions. Experiments on typical datasets (movie recommendations, influence
maximization) confirm scalability and high quality of solutions obtained via
our framework. Instance-specific approximations are typically in the 0.6-0.7
range and frequently beat even the $(1-1/e) \approx 0.63$ worst-case barrier

successfully classified devices that were not in the seen dataset with accuracy
above 95%. The first classifier is a logistic regression classifier based on

cope with different control signals to adjust individual qubits, which requires
a large overhead of control circuits. Here, we theoretically investigate how
random local fields affect cluster states and surface code states which
constitute the key highly entangled states in quantum computation. We find
similar behavior of temporal degradation of the fidelity for both cluster
states and surface code states for the number of qubits up to ten. We find that
the effect of local field fluctuations is greatly mitigated if the magnitude of
fluctuations can be suppressed below 10 % of the energy gap $\Delta$ for both
cluster states and surface code states. If the magnitude of fluctuations
exceeds $\Delta/2$, the fidelity for both states deteriorates dramatically. A
simple estimation based on the average fidelity up to $t\sim 2\hbar/\Delta$
shows that the maximum number of qubits that can be corrected with the 1 %
error threshold is less than 31 for surface code states and 27 for cluster
states. This means that the error correction should be carried out during a

perform a sequence of interventions in the system and use the data gathered

how much a feature vector informs us about an attribute, where a feature vector
can be from internal or final layers of a network. Expressivity is computed by
a second neural network whose inputs are features and attributes. The output of
the second neural network approximates the mutual information between feature

from the effect of thermal worldsheet fluctuations about the classical

temperature the magnetic field can generate a significant thermal fluctuation
of the thermal width of $\Upsilon(1s)$, but with the increase of temperature,
the effect of magnetic field on the thermal width becomes less important, which
means the effect of high temperature completely exceeds that of magnetic field
and magnetic field become less important at high temperature. The thermal width
decreases with the increasing rapidity at the finite temperature magnetized
background. It is also observed that the effect of the magnetic field on the
thermal width when dipole moving parallel to the magnetic field direction are
larger than that moving perpendicular to the magnetic field direction, which
implies that the magnetic field tends to enhance thermal fluctuation when
dipole moving parallel to the direction of magnetic field. The thermal width of
$\Upsilon(1S)$ hardly changes with the increasing temperature when dipole
moving perpendicular to the magnetic field. But when dipole moving parallel to

stochastic environmental fluctuations, and in addition, environments are
affected by bacterial activities since they consume substrates and excrete
various chemicals. We here study possible outcomes of population dynamics and
evolution under the repeated cycle of substrate-rich conditions and starvation,
called the ""feast-famine cycle"", by a simple stochastic model with the
trade-off relationship between the growth rate and the growth yield or the
death rate. In the model, the feast (substrate-rich) period is led by a
stochastic substrate addition event, while the famine (starvation) period is
evoked because bacteria use the supplied substrate. Under the repeated
feast-famine cycle, the bacterial population tends to increase the growth rate,
even though that tends to decrease the total population size due to the
trade-off. Analysis of the model shows that the ratio between the growth rate
and the death rate becomes the effective fitness of the population. Hence, the
functional form of the trade-off between the growth and death rate determines
if the bacterial population eventually goes extinct as an evolutionary
consequence. We then show that the increase of the added substrate in the feast
period can drive the extinction faster. Overall, the model sheds light on
non-trivial possible outcomes under repeated feast-famine cycles.

predict the loss cost for individual risks so that informative decisions are
made in various insurance operations such as underwriting, ratemaking, and
capital management. The loss cost is typically viewed to follow a compound
distribution where the summation of the severity variables is stopped by the
frequency variable. A challenging issue in modeling such outcome is to
accommodate the potential dependence between the number of claims and the size
of each individual claim. In this article, we introduce a novel regression
framework for compound distributions that uses a copula to accommodate the
association between the frequency and the severity variables, and thus allows
for arbitrary dependence between the two components. We further show that the
new model is very flexible and is easily modified to account for incomplete
data due to censoring or truncation. The flexibility of the proposed model is
illustrated using both simulated and real data sets. In the analysis of
granular claims data from property insurance, we find substantive negative
relationship between the number and the size of insurance claims. In addition,
we demonstrate that ignoring the frequency-severity association could lead to
biased decision-making in insurance operations.

the representation of reticulation events such as horizontal gene transfer or

these, tree-based phylogenetic networks, have been introduced to capture the
extent to which reticulate evolution nevertheless broadly follows tree-like
patterns. Several important operations that change a general phylogenetic
network have been developed in recent years, and are important for allowing
algorithms to move around spaces of networks; a vital ingredient in finding an
optimal network given some biological data. A key such operation is the Nearest

unrooted phylogenetic networks is connected under NNI, it has been unclear
whether this also holds for the subspace of tree-based networks. In this paper
we show that the space of unrooted tree-based phylogenetic networks is indeed

from one such network to another one without losing tree-basedness along the

which the postshock tangled magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is produced by the
two-stream and/or Weibel instabilities on plasma skin-depth scales
$(c/\omega_p)$. The field is expected to be oriented predominantly within the
shock plane ($B_{\perp}$; transverse to the shock normal, $\hat{n}_{\rm{sh}}$),
and is often approximated to be completely within it
($B_\parallel\equiv\hat{n}_{\rm{sh}}\,\cdot\,\vec{B}=0$). Current 2D/3D
particle-in-cell simulations are limited to short timescales and box sizes
$\lesssim10^4(c/\omega_p)\ll R/\Gamma_{\rm{sh}}$ much smaller than the shocked
region's comoving width, and cannot probe the asymptotic downstream $\vec{B}$
structure. We constrain the latter using the linear polarization upper limit,
$|\Pi|<12\%$, on the radio afterglow of GW170817/GRB170817A. Afterglow
polarization depends on the jet's angular structure, our viewing angle, and the
$\vec{B}$ structure. In GW170817/GRB170817A the latter can be tightly
constrained since the former two are constrained from observations. We model
$\vec{B}$ as an isotropic field in 3D that is stretched along
$\hat{n}_{\rm{sh}}$ by a factor $\xi\equiv{}B_{\parallel}/B_{\perp}$, whose
initial value $\xi_f\equiv{}B_{\parallel,f}/B_{\perp,f}$ describes the field
that survives downstream on plasma scales $\ll{}R/\Gamma_{\rm{sh}}$. We
calculate $\Pi(\xi_f)$ by integrating over the shocked volume for
core-dominated structured jets, with a local Blandford-McKee self-similar
radial profile. We find that independent of the exact jet structure, $\vec{B}$
has a finite, but initially sub-dominant, parallel component:
$0.57\lesssim\xi_f\lesssim0.89$, making it less anisotropic. While this
motivates numerical studies of the asymptotic $\vec{B}$ structure in
relativistic collisionless shocks, it may be consistent with turbulence
amplified magnetic field.

dimension reduction technique to obtain the latent space, and any standard
sampling algorithm to explore the low-dimensional space, here we specifically
use a combination of auto-encoders (for dimensionality reduction) and
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC, for sampling). To this end, we first run an HMC
to generate some initial samples from the original parameter space, and then
use these samples to train an auto-encoder. Next, starting with an initial
state, we use the encoding part of the autoencoder to map the initial state to
a point in the low-dimensional latent space. Using another HMC, this point is
then treated as an initial state in the latent space to generate a new state,
which is then mapped to the original space using the decoding part of the
auto-encoder. The resulting point can be treated as a Metropolis-Hasting (MH)
proposal, which is either accepted or rejected. While the induced dynamics in
the parameter space is no longer Hamiltonian, it remains time reversible, and
the Markov chain could still converge to the canonical distribution using a
volume correction term. Dropping the volume correction step results in
convergence to an approximate but reasonably accurate distribution. The
empirical results based on several high-dimensional problems show that our

provides a clear latent representation of the decoding process. To accomplish

diversity-encouraging prior based on determinantal point processes (DPP) to
improve latent representation learning by avoiding redundancy in the latent

involves presenting repeated sequences of odors at a single port and testing
the rats' ability to identify each odor. We show that our method leads to

M_{d, d}, W_t\in M_{1,d}\right\} \] where the spectral norm of each $W_i$ is
bounded by $O(1)$, the Frobenius norm is bounded by $R$, and $\rho$ is the
sigmoid function $\frac{e^x}{1+e^x}$ or the smoothened ReLU function $ \ln
(1+e^x)$. We show that for any depth $t$, if the inputs are in $[-1,1]^d$, the
sample complexity of $H$ is $\tilde O\left(\frac{dR^2}{\epsilon^2}\right)$.
This bound is optimal up to log-factors, and substantially improves over the
previous state of the art of $\tilde O\left(\frac{d^2R^2}{\epsilon^2}\right)$.
  We furthermore show that this bound remains valid if instead of considering
the magnitude of the $W_i$'s, we consider the magnitude of $W_i - W_i^0$, where
$W_i^0$ are some reference matrices, with spectral norm of $O(1)$. By taking
the $W_i^0$ to be the matrices at the onset of the training process, we get
sample complexity bounds that are sub-linear in the number of parameters, in
many typical regimes of parameters.
  To establish our results we develop a new technique to analyze the sample
complexity of families $H$ of predictors. We start by defining a new notion of
a randomized approximate description of functions $f:X\to\mathbb{R}^d$. We then
show that if there is a way to approximately describe functions in a class $H$
using $d$ bits, then $d/\epsilon^2$ examples suffices to guarantee uniform
convergence. Namely, that the empirical loss of all the functions in the class
is $\epsilon$-close to the true loss. Finally, we develop a set of tools for
calculating the approximate description length of classes of functions that can

reciprocity in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based Cell
Free Massive MIMO system where the responses of the (Radio Frequency) RF chains
render the end to end channel non-reciprocal, even though the physical wireless
channel is reciprocal. We further address the non-availability of the uplink
channel estimates at locations other than pilot subcarriers and propose a
single-shot solution to estimate the downlink channel at all subcarriers from
the uplink channel at selected pilot subcarriers. We propose a cascade of two
Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to achieve the objective. The proposed method is
easily scalable and removes the need for relative reciprocity calibration based
on the cooperation of antennas, which usually introduces dependency in Cell
Free Massive MIMO systems.

we identified three adjacent layers of plasma flowing at different speeds, and
detected KH instabilities at their interfaces. We could unambiguously track a
typical KH vortex and measure its motion. We found that the speed of this
vortex suddenly tripled at a certain stage. This acceleration was synchronized
with the enhancements in emission measure and average intensity of the 193

observed in the NVST channel was nearly complementary to that in the AIA 193

previous studies, as the cold plasma component is usually not visible in the
extreme ultraviolet channels that are only sensitive to high temperature plasma

hot plasma as invisible matters. We speculate that this process could occur at
a variety of length scales and could contribute to plasma heating.

argued that such probabilities are indeed more relevant for authors than the

correspondence between the entropy and the diversity with inequality measures,

diversity in ranking is calculated for further discussion. In this sample, the
seasonal aspects of the peer review process are outlined. It is found that the
use of such indices, non linear transformations of the data distributions,
allow to distinguish features and evolutions of peer review process as a
function of time as well as comparing non-uniformity of distributions.

  Letters",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent work in signal propagation theory has shown that dropout limits the
depth to which information can propagate through a neural network. In this
paper, we investigate the effect of initialisation on training speed and
generalisation for ReLU networks within this depth limit. We ask the following
research question: given that critical initialisation is crucial for training
at large depth, if dropout limits the depth at which networks are trainable,
does initialising critically still matter? We conduct a large-scale controlled
experiment, and perform a statistical analysis of over $12000$ trained
networks. We find that (1) trainable networks show no statistically significant
difference in performance over a wide range of non-critical initialisations;
(2) for initialisations that show a statistically significant difference, the
net effect on performance is small; (3) only extreme initialisations (very
small or very large) perform worse than criticality. These findings also apply
to standard ReLU networks of moderate depth as a special case of zero dropout.
Our results therefore suggest that, in the shallow-to-moderate depth setting,
critical initialisation provides zero performance gains when compared to
off-critical initialisations and that searching for off-critical
initialisations that might improve training speed or generalisation, is likely
to be a fruitless endeavour.

$\mathcal{A}_{\|\cdot\|}(X, Y)$ of all norm-attaining operators $T$ from $X$

that if $\|Tx\| > 1 - \eta$, then there is $x_0$ such that $\| x_0 - x\| <
\epsilon$ and $T$ itself attains its norm at $x_0$. We show that every norm one
functional on $c_0$ which attains its norm belongs to
$\mathcal{A}_{\|\cdot\|}(c_0, \mathbb{K})$. Also, we prove that the analogous
result holds neither for $\mathcal{A}_{\|\cdot\|}(\ell_1, \mathbb{K})$ nor
$\mathcal{A}_{\|\cdot\|}(\ell_{\infty}, \mathbb{K})$. Under some assumptions,
we show that the sphere of the compact operators belongs to
$\mathcal{A}_{\|\cdot\|}(X, Y)$ and that this is no longer true when some of
these hypotheses are dropped. The analogous set $\mathcal{A}_{nu}(X)$ for
numerical radius of an operator instead of its norm is also defined and
studied. We present a complete characterization for the diagonal operators

$\mathcal{A}_{nu}(X)$ when $X=c_0$ or $\ell_p$. As a consequence, we get that
the canonical projections $P_N$ on these spaces belong to our sets. We give
examples of operators on infinite dimensional Banach spaces which belong to
$\mathcal{A}_{\| \cdot \|}(X, X)$ but not to $\mathcal{A}_{nu}(X)$ and
vice-versa. Finally, we establish some techniques which allow us to connect
both sets by using direct sums.

through experiments and theoretical predictions. However, a systematic study of

terms of examining the effects of concentration and molecular weight, has not
been carried out so far. Prior studies of the shear rheology of semidilute
polymer solutions have demonstrated that their behaviour is distinctively
different from that observed in the dilute and concentrated regimes. This
difference in behaviour is anticipated to be even more pronounced in
extensional flows. In this work, the extensional rheology of linear,
double-stranded DNA molecules, spanning an order of magnitude of molecular
weights (25 to 289 kilobasepairs) and concentrations (0.03 to 0.3 mg/ml), has
been investigated. DNA solutions are now used routinely as model polymeric
systems due to their near-perfect monodispersity. Measurements have been
carried out with a filament stretching rheometer since it is the most reliable
method for obtaining an estimate of the elongational stress growth of a polymer
solution. Transient and steady-state uniaxial extensional viscosities of DNA
dissolved in a solvent under excess salt conditions, with a high concentration
of sucrose in order to achieve a sufficiently high solvent viscosity, have been
determined in the semidilute regime at room temperature. The dependence of the
steady state uniaxial extensional viscosity on molecular weight, concentration
and extension rate is measured with a view to determining if data collapse can
be observed with an appropriate choice of variables. Steady state shear
viscosity measurements suggest that sucrose-DNA interactions might play a role
in determining the observed rheological behaviour of semidilute DNA solutions
with sucrose as a component in the solvent.

random unitary operators, in a manner which is convincing to unbounded

  This problem has previously only been considered for restricted adversaries.
Against adversaries with an a priori bound on the number of queries, it is
well-known that $t$-designs suffice. Against polynomial-time adversaries, one
can use pseudorandom states (PRS) and pseudorandom unitaries (PRU), as defined
in a recent work of Ji, Liu, and Song; unfortunately, no provably secure
construction is known for PRUs.
  In our setting, we are concerned with unbounded adversaries. Nonetheless, we
are able to give stateful quantum algorithms which simulate the ideal object in
both settings of interest. In the case of Haar-random states, our simulator is
polynomial-time, has negligible error, and can also simulate verification and
reflection through the simulated state. This yields an immediate application to
quantum money: a money scheme which is information-theoretically unforgeable
and untraceable. In the case of Haar-random unitaries, our simulator takes
polynomial space, but simulates both forward and inverse access with zero
error.
  These results can be seen as the first significant steps in developing a
theory of lazy sampling for random quantum objects.

and the critical scaling of the band spectrum of the associated Zakharov-Shabat

the ""background'' Stokes mode. The key quantity of interest is the density of
states defining, in principle, all spectral and statistical properties of a
soliton (breather) gas. The balance of terms in the nonlinear dispersion
relations determines the nature of the gas: from an ideal gas of well
separated, non-interacting breathers (solitons) to a special limiting state,
which we term breather (soliton) condensate, and whose properties are entirely
determined by the pairwise interactions between breathes (solitons). For a
non-homogeneous breather gas, we derive a full set of kinetic equations
describing slow evolution of the density of states and of its carrier wave
counterpart. The kinetic equation for soliton gas is recovered by collapsing

search within days, lengthy training is still required for a specific

Recently one-shot NAS methods are proposed to largely squeeze the tedious
training process by sharing parameters across candidates. In this way, the
parameters for each candidate can be directly extracted from the shared
parameters instead of training them from scratch. However, they have no sense
of which candidate will perform better until evaluation so that the candidates
to evaluate are randomly sampled and the top-1 candidate is considered the
best. In this paper, we propose a Self-Evaluated Template Network (SETN) to
improve the quality of the architecture candidates for evaluation so that it is
more likely to cover competitive candidates. SETN consists of two components:
(1) an evaluator, which learns to indicate the probability of each individual
architecture being likely to have a lower validation loss. The candidates for
evaluation can thus be selectively sampled according to this evaluator. (2) a
template network, which shares parameters among all candidates to amortize the
training cost of generated candidates. In experiments, the architecture found
by SETN achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR and ImageNet benchmarks
within comparable computation costs. Code is publicly available on GitHub:

and an excitation whose energy is smaller than the band-gap energy (Eg = 1.24
eV) of CoF2O4, which we refer to as ""below-band-gap excitation (BBGE)""

preferential excitation energy of the Fe2+ (Oh) cations. In addition, the
intensity of the BBGE was significantly increased when the thickness of the
CoFe2O4 layer was decreased from 11 to 1.4 nm, which coincides with the
increase in the site occupancy of the Fe2+ (Oh) cations with decreasing the
thickness. These results indicate that the BBGE comes from the in-gap states of
the Fe2+ (Oh) cations whose density increases near the heterointerface on the
bottom Al2O3 layer. We have demonstrated that RIXS measurements and analyses in

challenges involve the network characteristic difference problem and different
directivity properties of the social and anchor links to be predicted. To
address the problem, we propose an application oriented network embedding
framework, Hierarchical Graph Attention based Network Embedding (HGANE), for
collective link prediction over directed aligned networks. Very different from
the conventional general network embedding models, HGANE effectively
incorporates the collective link prediction task objectives into consideration.
It learns the representations of nodes by aggregating information from both the

(connected by anchor links). What's more, we introduce a hierarchical graph

distribution --- channel transmission loss and noise. Previously, a linear
bound was believed to put an upper limit on the rate-transmittance performance.
Remarkably, the recently proposed twin-field and phase-matching quantum key
distribution schemes have been proven to overcome the linear bound. In
practice, due to the intractable phase fluctuation of optical signals in
transmission, these schemes suffer from large error rates, which renders the
experimental realization extremely challenging. Here, we close this gap by
proving the security based on a different principle --- encoding symmetry. With
the symmetry-based security proof, we can decouple the privacy from the channel
disturbance, and eventually remove the limitation of secure key distribution on
bit error rates. That is, the phase-matching scheme can yield positive key
rates even with high bit error rates up to 50%. In simulation, with typical
experimental parameters, the key rate is able to break the linear bound with an
error rate of 13%. Meanwhile, we provide a finite-data size analysis for the
scheme, which can break the bound with a reasonable data size of $10^{12}$.
Encouraged by high loss- and error-tolerance, we expect the approach based on
symmetry-protected privacy will provide a new insight to the security of
quantum key distribution.

software development for total-reflection high-energy positron diffraction
(TRHEPD), a novel experimental technique for surface structure determination.
Experiments using TRHEPD are being conducted intensively at the Slow Positron
Facility, Institute of Materials Structure Science, High Energy Accelerator
Research Organization, revealing surface structure of interest. The data
analysis software provides a solution to the inverse problem in which the
atomic positions of a surface structure are determined from the experimental
diffraction data (rocking curve). The forward problem is solved by the
numerical solution of the partial differential equation in the quantum
scattering problem. A technical demonstration with a test problem was carried
out to confirm the software functioned as expected. Since the analysis method
has a general mathematical foundation, it is also applicable to other
experiments, such as X-ray or electron diffraction experiments.

modeling problems. In this work, we propose to power the modeling capacity of
HMM by bringing in neural network based generative models. The proposed model
is termed as GenHMM. In the proposed GenHMM, each HMM hidden state is
associated with a neural network based generative model that has tractability
of exact likelihood and provides efficient likelihood computation. A generative
model in GenHMM consists of mixture of generators that are realized by flow
models. A learning algorithm for GenHMM is proposed in expectation-maximization
framework. The convergence of the learning GenHMM is analyzed. We demonstrate
the efficiency of GenHMM by classification tasks on practical sequential data.

whilst the LJ potential was designed for noble gases such as argon, it is often
used for systems where it is not expected to be particularly realistic. Under
those circumstances, the disadvantages of the LJ potential become relevant:
most important among these is that in simulations the LJ potential is always
modified such that it has a finite range. More seriously, there is by now a
whole family of different potentials that are all called Lennard-Jones 12-6,
and that are all different - and that may have very different macroscopic
properties. In this paper, we consider alternatives to the LJ 12-6 potential
that could be employed under conditions where the LJ potential is only used as
a typical short-ranged potential with attraction. We construct a class of
potentials that are, in many respects LJ-like but that are by construction
finite ranged, vanishing quadratically at the cut-off distance, and that are
designed to be computationally cheap. Below, we present this potential and
report numerical data for its thermodynamic and transport properties, for the
most important cases: cut-off distance rc=2 (LJ-like) and rc=1.2 (a typical

model inspired by molecular dynamics; pedestrians are treated as point

  The SPED model's slow speed is a bottleneck to performing a large parameter

  Price of VIX Futures",,,,,"q-fin.MF math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has often been stated that, within the class of continuous stochastic
volatility models calibrated to vanillas, the price of a VIX future is
maximized by the Dupire local volatility model. In this article we prove that
this statement is incorrect: we build a continuous stochastic volatility model
in which a VIX future is strictly more expensive than in its associated local
volatility model. More generally, in this model, strictly convex payoffs on a
squared VIX are strictly cheaper than in the associated local volatility model.
This corresponds to an inversion of convex ordering between local and
stochastic variances, when moving from instantaneous variances to squared VIX,
as convex payoffs on instantaneous variances are always cheaper in the local
volatility model. We thus prove that this inversion of convex ordering, which
is observed in the SPX market for short VIX maturities, can be produced by a
continuous stochastic volatility model. We also prove that the model can be
extended so that, as suggested by market data, the convex ordering is preserved
for long maturities.

efficient visual tracking. Recent years, ensembled trackers which combine
multiple component trackers have achieved impressive performance. In ensembled
trackers, the decision of results is usually a post-event process, i.e.,
tracking result for each tracker is first obtained and then the suitable one is
selected according to result ensemble. In this paper, we propose a pre-event
method. We construct an expert pool with each expert being one set of features.
For each frame, several experts are first selected in the pool according to
their past performance and then they are used to predict the object. The
selection rate of each expert in the pool is then updated and tracking result
is obtained according to result ensemble. We propose a novel pre-known
expert-adaptive selection strategy. Since the process is more efficient, more
experts can be constructed by fusing more types of features which leads to more
robustness. Moreover, with the novel expert selection strategy, overfitting
caused by fixed experts for each frame can be mitigated. Experiments on several
public available datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
and its state-of-the-art performance among ensembled trackers.

for measuring how a recommendation algorithm is responsive to users' true

degrees of miscalibration. A well-known type of bias in recommendation is
popularity bias where few popular items are over-represented in
recommendations, while the majority of other items do not get significant
exposure. We conjecture that popularity bias is one important factor leading to
miscalibration in recommendation. Our experimental results using two real-world
datasets show that there is a strong correlation between how different user
groups are affected by algorithmic popularity bias and their level of interest
in popular items. Moreover, we show algorithms with greater popularity bias
amplification tend to have greater miscalibration.

Neurons are assigned a specific current value, which is heterogenous across the

of the method is to recover the distribution of incoming network degrees, as
well as the distribution of the assigned currents, from global field

organizing the neurons in different classes, depending on their associated

than being a global property as suggested by extracting a single resistance
value. Consequently, techniques that resolve local structure in the electronic
potential are crucial for a detailed understanding of electronic transport in
realistic devices. Recently, we have introduced a new potentiometry method
based on low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) that utilizes characteristic
features in the reflectivity spectra of layered materials [1]. Performing
potentiometry experiments in LEEM has the advantage of being fast, offering a
large field of view and the option to zoom in and out easily, and of being
non-invasive compared to scanning-probe methods. However, not all materials
show clear features in their reflectivity spectra. Here we, therefore, focus on
a different version of low-energy electron potentiometry (LEEP) that uses the
mirror mode transition, i.e. the drop in electron reflectivity around zero
electron landing energy when they start to interact with the sample rather than
being reflected in front of it. This transition is universal and sensitive to
the local electrostatic surface potential (either workfunction or applied
potential). It can consequently be used to perform LEEP experiments on a
broader range of material compared to the method described in Ref. [1]. We
provide a detailed description of the experimental setup and demonstrate LEEP
on workfunction-related intrinsic potential variations on the Si(111) surface
and for a metal-semiconductor-metal junction with an external bias applied. In
the latter, we visualize the Schottky effect at the metal-semiconductor
interface. Finally, we compare how robust the two LEEP techniques discussed
above are against image distortions due to sample inhomogeneities or
contamination.

particular, we consider two upper bounds for the speed of sound, $v_s = c$ and
$v_s = c/\sqrt{3}$, and the one provided by the relativistic kinetic theory. We

relations of the mentioned bulk properties with the transition density are
derived and compared with the corresponding nonrotating cases. We concluded
that the proposed limit $v_{s}=c/\sqrt{3}$ leads to dramatic decrease on the
values of the maximum mass, Kerr parameter and moment of inertia preventing a
neutron star to reach values which derived with the consideration of realistic

Replicated State Machine (RSM) with commutative update operations. The key
advantage of LA and Generalized LA is that they can be solved in asynchronous

In this paper we assume Byzantine failures. We propose the Wait Till Safe (WTS)

but whether the cross-sectional scaling law is applicable to the temporal
growth of individual cities is unclear. Here we first find two paradoxical
scaling relationships that urban built-up area sub-linearly scales with
population across cities, but super-linearly scales with population over time
in most individual cities because urban land expands faster than population
grows. Different cities have diverse temporal scaling exponents and one city
even has opposite temporal scaling regimes during two periods, strongly
supporting the absence of single temporal scaling and further illustrating the
failure of cross-sectional urban scaling in predicting temporal growth of
cities. We propose a conceptual model that can clarify the essential difference
and also connections between the cross-sectional scaling law and temporal
trajectories of cities. Our model shows that cities have an extra growth of
built-up area over time besides the supposed growth predicted by the
cross-sectional scaling law. Disparities of extra growth among different-sized
cities change the cross-sectional scaling exponent. Further analyses of GDP and
other indicators confirm the contradiction between cross-sectional and temporal
scaling relationships and the validity of the conceptual model. Our findings
may open a new avenue towards the science of cities.

($\gamma^*$ is Weizsacker-Willams photon) reaction to probe the non-standard
$W^+W^-\gamma$ couplings at the Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) and the
Future Circular Collider-hadron electron (FCC-he). We find $95\%$ confidence
level bounds on the anomalous coupling $\Delta\kappa_\gamma$ and
$\lambda_\gamma$ parameters in the view of effective Lagrangian approach with
various values of the integrated luminosity. We assume center-of-mass energies
of the electron-proton system $\sqrt{s}= 1.30, 1.98, 7.07, 10\hspace{0.8mm}{\rm
TeV}$ and luminosities ${\cal L} = 10-1000 \hspace{0.8mm}{\rm fb^{-1}}$. The
best limits obtained from the process $e^-p \to e^-\gamma^*p \to e^-W^-q'X$ on
the anomalous $\Delta\kappa_\gamma$ and $\lambda_\gamma$ couplings are
$\Delta\kappa_\gamma = |0.00069|$ and $\lambda_\gamma = [-0.0099, 0.0054]$.
These bounds show that the process under consideration is a good prospect for
the searching of the non-standard $\Delta\kappa_\gamma$ and $\lambda_\gamma$
couplings at the LHeC and the FCC-he. In addition, our results provide
complementary information on other results for $\Delta\kappa_\gamma$ and
$\lambda_\gamma$ couplings.

practice, the potential risk of PET-associated radiation dose to patients needs
to be minimized. However, with the reduction in the radiation dose, the
resultant images may suffer from noise and artifacts that compromise diagnostic
performance. In this paper, we propose a parameter-transferred Wasserstein
generative adversarial network (PT-WGAN) for low-dose PET image denoising. The
contributions of this paper are twofold: i) a PT-WGAN framework is designed to
denoise low-dose PET images without compromising structural details, and ii) a
task-specific initialization based on transfer learning is developed to train
PT-WGAN using trainable parameters transferred from a pretrained model, which
significantly improves the training efficiency of PT-WGAN. The experimental
results on clinical data show that the proposed network can suppress image
noise more effectively while preserving better image fidelity than recently
published state-of-the-art methods. We make our code available at
https://github.com/90n9-yu/PT-WGAN.

  Mechanical Systems",,,,,"cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data-driven models are becoming essential parts in modern mechanical systems,
commonly used to capture the behavior of various equipment and varying
environmental characteristics. Despite the advantages of these data-driven
models on excellent adaptivity to high dynamics and aging equipment, they are
usually hungry to massive labels over historical data, mostly contributed by
human engineers at an extremely high cost. The label demand is now the major
limiting factor to modeling accuracy, hindering the fulfillment of visions for
applications. Fortunately, domain adaptation enhances the model generalization
by utilizing the labelled source data as well as the unlabelled target data and
then we can reuse the model on different domains. However, the mainstream
domain adaptation methods cannot achieve ideal performance on time series data,
because most of them focus on static samples and even the existing time series
domain adaptation methods ignore the properties of time series data, such as
temporal causal mechanism. In this paper, we assume that causal mechanism is
invariant and present our Causal Mechanism Transfer Network(CMTN) for time
series domain adaptation. By capturing and transferring the dynamic and
temporal causal mechanism of multivariate time series data and alleviating the
time lags and different value ranges among different machines, CMTN allows the
data-driven models to exploit existing data and labels from similar systems,
such that the resulting model on a new system is highly reliable even with very
limited data. We report our empirical results and lessons learned from two
real-world case studies, on chiller plant energy optimization and boiler fault
detection, which outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method.

result, emergent gravity can not be realised for such flow. Our work gives a
new perspective of examining the perturbations in a fluid from a different
approach (other than Eulerian approach) which is the way of using Lagrangian
Perturbation Theory. We make use of Lagrangian description of motion to examine
the propagation of Eikonal wave (wave having very short wavelength) from the
reference frame of the observer moving with the background flow. We find that
waves of ultra short wavelength propagate similar to waves in a static uniform
medium in the near vicinity of the observer. We restrict ourselves to
nonrelativistic flows in astrophysical black hole accretion.

presents an alternative approach in which tools learn to detect flaws

(methylation beta pattern) of breast cancer. Many cancers are triggered by
abnormal gene expression levels caused by aberrant methylation of CpG sites in
the DNA. In order to develop early diagnostics of cancer-causing methylations
and to develop a treatment, it is necessary to identify a few dozen key
cancer-related CpG methylation sites out of the millions of locations in the
DNA. This research used public TCGA dataset to train a TensorFlow machine
learning model to classify breast cancer versus non-breast-cancer tissue
samples, based on over 300,000 methylation beta values in each sample. L1
regularization was applied to identify the CpG methylation sites most important
for accurate classification. It was hypothesized that CpG sites with the
highest learned model weights correspond to DNA locations most relevant to
breast cancer. A reduced model trained on methylation betas of just the 25 CpG
sites having the highest weights in the full model (trained on methylation
betas at over 300,000 CpG sites) has achieved over 94% accuracy on evaluation
data, confirming that the identified 25 CpG sites are indeed a biomarker of
breast cancer.
