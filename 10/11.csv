uncertain loads and renewable generator capacity. Our model follows previous
work in assuming that generator outputs respond to load imbalances according to
an affine control policy, but introduces a model of saturation of generator
reserves by assuming that when a generator's target level hits its limit, it
abandons the affine policy and produces at that limit. This is a particularly
interesting feature in models where wind power plants, which have uncertain
upper generation limits, are scheduled to provide reserves to balance load
fluctuations. The resulting model is a nonsmooth nonconvex two-stage stochastic
program, and we use a stochastic approximation method to find stationary
solutions to a smooth approximation. Computational results on 6-bus and 118-bus
test instances demonstrates that by considering the effects of saturation, our
model can yield solutions with lower expected generation costs (at the same
target line violation probability level) than those obtained from a model that
enforces the affine policy to stay within generator limits with high
probability.

Instead of approximating targets with their centroids, our approach is capable
of utilizing noisy 3D point segments of objects to estimate their motion. To

e.g. through the multi-network structure, which also causes stress-strain
hysteresis indicating strain-induced damage. However, it remains unclear
whether cross-link breakage follows a predictable pattern that can be used to
understand the damage evolution with strain. Using coarse-grained molecular

bond-breaking events are controlled by the evolution of the global shortest
path length between well-separated cross-links, which is both anisotropic and
hysteretic with strain. These findings establish an explicit connection between
the molecular structure and the macroscopic mechanical behavior of elastomers,

dunes, known as barchans. One of them concerns the trajectories of individual
grains over the dune, and how they affect its shape. In the case of subaqueous
barchans, we proposed in Alvarez and Franklin [Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 164503
(2018)] that their extremities, called horns, are formed mainly by grains
migrating from upstream regions of the initial pile, and that they exhibit
significant transverse displacements. Here, we extend our previous work to
address the dynamics of grains migrating to horns after the dune has reached
its crescentic shape, and present new aspects of the problem. In our
experiments, single barchans evolve, under the action of a water turbulent
flow, from heaps of conical shape formed from glass beads poured on the bottom
wall of a rectangular channel. Both for evolving and developed barchans, the
horns are fed up with grains coming from upstream regions of the bedform and
traveling with significant transverse components, differently from the dynamics
usually described for the aeolian case. For these grains, irrespective of their
size and strength of water flow, the distributions of transverse and streamwise
components of velocities are well described by exponential functions, with the
probability density functions of their magnitudes being similar to results
obtained from previous studies on flat beds. Focusing on moving grains whose
initial positions were on the horns, we show that their residence time and
traveled distance are related following a quasi-linear relation. Our results
provide new insights into the physical mechanisms underlying the shape of
barchan dunes.

on a density threshold to achieve high resolution following the evolution of
the magnetic clouds and the leading bow shocks. All the simulations discussed
in the present paper were performed using the same initial grid and numerical
methods. The polarity of the internal magnetic field of the CME has a
substantial effect on its propagation velocity and on its deformation and
erosion during its evolution towards Earth. We quantified the effects of the
polarity of the internal magnetic field of the CMEs and of the density of the
background solar wind on the arrival times of the shock front and the magnetic
cloud. We determined the positions and propagation velocities of the magnetic
clouds and thus also the stand-off distance of the leading shock fronts (i.e.
the thickness of the magnetic sheath region) and the deformation and erosion of
the magnetic clouds during their evolution from the Sun to the Earth. Inverse
CMEs were found to be faster than normal CMEs ejected in the same initial
conditions, but with smaller stand-off distances. They also have a higher
magnetic cloud length, opening angle, and mass. Synthetic satellite time series
showed that the shock magnitude is not affected by the polarity of the CME.
However, the density peak of the magnetic cloud is dependent on the polarity
and, in case of inverse CMEs, also on the background wind density. The
magnitude of the z-component of the magnetic field was not influenced by either
the polarity or the wind density.

considerable interest in graphics and vision communities due to their ability
to provide the user with interactive visual content. One of the earliest and
most common light field operations is digital refocus, enabling the user to
choose the focus and depth-of-field for the image after capture. A common
interactive method for such an operation utilizes disparity estimations,
readily available from the light field, to allow the user to point-and-click on
the image to chose the location of the refocus plane.
  In this paper, we address the interactivity of a lesser-known light field
operation: refocus to a non-frontoparallel plane, simulating the result of
traditional tilt-shift photography. For this purpose we introduce a generalized
shift-and-sum framework. Further, we show that the inclusion of depth
information allows for intuitive interactive methods for placement of the
refocus plane. In addition to refocusing, light fields also enable the user to
interact with the viewpoint, which can be easily included in the proposed
generalized shift-and-sum framework.

improve quality of life for millions of people worldwide. Yet, conducting
research in this area presents numerous challenges, including the risks of
physical interaction between people and robots. Physics simulations have been
used to optimize and train robots for physical assistance, but have typically
focused on a single task. In this paper, we present Assistive Gym, an open
source physics simulation framework for assistive robots that models multiple
tasks. It includes six simulated environments in which a robotic manipulator
can attempt to assist a person with activities of daily living (ADLs): itch
scratching, drinking, feeding, body manipulation, dressing, and bathing.
Assistive Gym models a person's physical capabilities and preferences for
assistance, which are used to provide a reward function. We present baseline
policies trained using reinforcement learning for four different commercial
robots in the six environments. We demonstrate that modeling human motion
results in better assistance and we compare the performance of different
robots. Overall, we show that Assistive Gym is a promising tool for assistive
robotics research.

use a CPU and a QPU to generate random numbers for multiple Machine Learning

distributions of Dense and Convolutional Neural Networks, in which results show
a profound difference in learning patterns for the two. In 50 Dense Neural

at +0.1%, and QRNG exceeded PRNG for mental state EEG classification by +2.82%.
In 50 Convolutional Neural Networks (25 PRNG/25 QRNG), the MNIST and CIFAR-10

-0.12%. This pattern is also seen in the EEG classification problem, where a
QRT performs worse than a RT by -0.28%. Finally, the QRT is ensembled into a

To this end, it is crucial to have oscillators capable of characterizing any

2-dimensional oscillator whose limit cycle can be matched to any periodic

holographic QCD, and employing Witten diagrams in the bulk, we compute the
diffractive photoproduction amplitude of $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$. The
holographic amplitude shows elements of the strictures of vector meson
dominance (VMD). It is dominated by the exchange of a massive graviton or
$2^{++}$ glueball resonances near threshold, and its higher spin-j counterparts
that reggeize at higher energies. Both the differential and total cross
sections are controlled by the gravitational form factor $A(t)$, and compare
well to the recent results reported by the GlueX collaboration near threshold
and the world data at large $\sqrt{s}$. The holographic gravitational form
factors, including the D-term, which is due to the exchange of massive spin-0
glueballs, are in good agreement with lattice simulations. We use it to extract
the holographic pressure and shear forces inside the proton. Finally, using a
pertinent integral representation of the holographic gravitational form factor

joint training, which directly learns unified multilingual representations
using monolingual and cross-lingual objectives jointly. In this paper, we first
conduct direct comparisons of representations learned using both of these

dust aggregates in protoplanetary discs. Using a 3D two-phase (gas-dust) SPH
code, we investigate the combined effects of growth and fragmentation of a
multi-phase dust with different fragmentation thresholds in a time-evolving
disc. We find that our fiducial disc, initially in a fragmentation regime,
moves toward a pure-growth regime in a few thousands years. Timescales change
as a function of the disc and dust properties. When fragmentation is efficient,
it produces, in different zones of the disc, Fe/Si and rock/ice ratios
different from those predicted when only pure growth is considered. Chemical
fractionation and the depletion/enrichment in iron observed in some chondrites
can be linked to the size-density sorting and fragmentation properties of
precursor dusty grains . We suggest that aggregation of chondritic components
could have occurred where/when fragmentation was not efficient if their
aerodynamical sorting has to be preserved. Chondritic components would allow
aerodynamical sorting in a fragmentation regime only if they have similar
fragmentation properties. We find that, in the inner disc, and for the same
interval of time, fragmenting dust can grow larger when compared to the size of
grains predicted by pure growth. This counter-intuitive behaviour is due to the
large amount of dust which piles up in a fragmenting zone followed by the rapid
growth that occurs when this zone transitions to a pure growth regime. As an
important consequence, dust can overcome the radial-drift barrier within a few
thousands years.

systems, representing the bodies as two finite mass distributions whose
dynamics are influenced by their mutual gravity potential. The emergent
behavior of the F2BP is highly coupled translational and rotational mutual
motion of the mass distributions. A large fraction of characterized binary
asteroids appear to be at, or near, the doubly synchronous equilibrium, which
occurs when both bodies are tidally-locked and in a circular co-orbit. Stable
oscillations about this equilibrium can be shown, for the nonplanar system, to
be combinations of seven fundamental frequencies of the system and the mutual
orbit rate. The fundamental frequencies arise as the linear periods of center
manifolds identified about the equilibrium which are heavily influenced by each
body's mass parameters. We leverage these eight dynamical constraints to
investigate the observability of binary asteroid mass parameters via dynamical
observations. This is accomplished by deriving a relationship between the
fundamental frequencies and mass parameters for doubly synchronous systems.
This relationship allows us to show the sensitivity of the dynamics to changes
in the mass parameters, first for the planar dynamics, and then for the
nonplanar dynamics. In so doing we are able to predict the idealized estimation
covariance of the mass parameters based on observation quality and define
idealized observation accuracies for desired mass parameter certainties. We
apply these tools to 617 Patroclus, a doubly synchronous Trojan binary and
flyby target of the LUCY mission, as well as the Pluto and Charon system in
order to predict mutual behavior

on each level $l$. In the cases considered in this work, the computational
saving due to the coarse mesh samples saving is $20\%$ asymptotically. Besides,

discover effective strategies for on-the-fly personalization. One significant
benefit of meta-learning is that the personalized transcoder naturally enforces

  In this article, also motivated by the lack of junction between the notion of
equivariant formality and the concept of formality of spaces (surging from
rational homotopy theory) we suggest two new variations of equivariant
formality: ""MOD-formal actions"" and ""actions of formal core"".

elliptic spaces to manifolds of non-negative sectional curvature.
  A major motivation for the new definitions was that an almost free action of
a torus $T^n\curvearrowright X$ possessing any of the two new properties
satisfies the toral rank conjecture, i.e. $dim H^*(X;Q)\geq 2^n$. This
generalizes and proves the toral rank conjecture for actions with formal orbit

formed by the pixel values of all possible backdoor triggers. An original
trigger used by an attacker to build the backdoored model represents only a
point in the space. It then will be generalized into a distribution of valid
triggers, all of which can influence the backdoored model. Thus, previous
methods that model only one point of the trigger distribution is not

modeling, is a key to effective defense. However, existing generative modeling
techniques for image generation are not applicable to the backdoor scenario as
the trigger distribution is completely unknown. In this work, we propose
max-entropy staircase approximator (MESA), an algorithm for high-dimensional
sampling-free generative modeling and use it to recover the trigger

environmental-dependence effect on galaxy evolution for normal and luminous

accretion from ``infinite'', steady-supply disks and from finite-sized,

${\sim}0.2\Omega_{\rm{b}}$ for $q_{\rm{b}}>0.5$ and $\Omega_{\rm{b}}$ for
$q_{\rm{b}}<0.5$, ($\Omega_{\rm{b}}$ is the binary angular frequency). We find
that the accretion ``eigenvalue'' $l_0$ -- the net angular momentum transfer
from the disk to the binary per unit accreted mass -- is always positive and
falls in the range ($0.65$-$0.85)a_{\rm b}^2\Omega_{\rm{b}}$ (with $a_{\rm{b}}$
the binary separation), depending weakly on the mass ratio and viscosity. This
leads to binary expansion when $q_{\rm{b}}\gtrsim0.3$. Accretion from a finite
torus can be separated into two phases: an initial transient phase,
corresponding to the filling of the binary cavity, followed by a viscous
pseudo-stationary phase, during which the torus viscously spreads and accretes
onto the binary. In the viscous phase, the net torque on the binary per unit
accreted mass is close to $l_0$, the value derived for ``infinite'' disks. We
conclude that similar-mass binaries accreting from CBDs gain angular momentum
and expand over long time scales. This result significantly impacts the
coalescence of supermassive binary black holes and newly formed binary stars.
We offer a word of caution against conclusions drawn from simulations of

geometries. These are derived in the Gaussian limit (setting higher-order
correlation functions to zero), but for arbitrary non-linear 2PCFs (which may
be estimated from the survey itself), with a shot-noise rescaling parameter
included to capture non-Gaussianity. We generalize previous approaches to
include Legendre moments via a geometry-correction function calibrated from
measured pair and triple counts. Making use of importance sampling and random
particle catalogs, we can estimate model covariances in fractions of the time
required to do so with mocks, obtaining estimates with negligible sampling
noise in $\sim 10$ ($\sim 100$) CPU-hours for the 2PCF (3PCF) auto-covariance.
We compare results to sample covariances from a suite of BOSS DR12 mocks and
find the matrices to be in good agreement, assuming a shot-noise rescaling
parameter of $1.03$ ($1.20$) for the 2PCF (3PCF). To obtain strongest
constraints on cosmological parameters we must use multiple statistics in
concert; having robust methods to measure their covariances at low
computational cost is thus of great relevance to upcoming surveys.

condensations of stacked layers of 2D anyons. It is less obvious if 3D Type-II
fractons can be understood from a similar perspective. In this paper, we affirm
that this is the case: we produce the paradigm Type-II fracton model, Haah's
cubic code, from a 2D layer construction. However, this is not a condensation
of 2D anyons, but rather we start with stacks of 2D subsystem-symmetry
protected topological states (SSPT). As this parent model is not topologically
ordered in the strict sense, whereas the final state is, we refer to this
process as a distillation as we are forming a long-range entangled (LRE) state
from several copies of a short-range entangled (SRE) state. We also show that
Type-I fracton topological order can also be distilled from SSPT states in the
form of the cluster-cube model which we introduce here. We start by introducing
the Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory of distillation. However, a more
detailed analysis from which the perturbation theory follows, is also performed
using linear gauge structures and an extension we introduce here referred to as
gauge substructures. This allows us to rigorously define distillation as well
as understand the process of obtaining LRE from SRE. We can diagnose the source
of LRE as the distillation of subsystem symmetries into robust long-range
ground state degeneracy as characterized by logical operators of the resulting
stabilizer code. Furthermore, we find which Hamiltonian terms are necessary for
selecting the ground state which results from the perturbation. This leads to a
protocol for realizing a fracton quantum error correcting code initialized in a
chosen fiducial state using only finite-depth circuits and local measurements.

of these constraints is that there is an upper bound on the ratio of

suffered violent bending instabilities driven by anisotropic velocity
distributions. We investigate for the first time how the frequency of B/P
bulges in barred galaxies evolves from $z = 1$ to $z\approx 0$, using a large
sample of non-edge-on galaxies with masses $M_{\star} > 10^{10}\:M_{\odot}$,
selected from the HST COSMOS survey. We find the observed fraction increases
from $0^{+3.6}_{-0.0}\%$ at $z = 1$ to $37.8^{+5.4}_{-5.1}\%$ at $z = 0.2$. We
account for problems identifying B/P bulges in galaxies with low inclinations
and unfavourable bar orientations, and due to redshift-dependent observational
biases with the help of a sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, matched in
resolution, rest-frame band, signal-to-noise ratio and stellar mass and
analysed in the same fashion. From this, we estimate that the true fraction of
barred galaxies with B/P bulges increases from $\sim 10\%$ at $z \approx 1$ to
$\sim 70\%$ at $z = 0$. In agreement with previous results for nearby galaxies,
we find a strong dependence of the presence of a B/P bulge on galaxy stellar
mass. This trend is observed in both local and high-redshift galaxies,
indicating that it is an important indicator of vertical instabilities across a
large fraction of the age of the Universe. We propose that galaxy formation

explore how chaotic many-body quantum physics can lead to exponential

the Ehrenfest time, which scales logarithmically with the number of spins $N$.
In this regime, the echo is well described by the semiclassical (truncated

deviations from a single-component Gaussian model in the combined residuals and
(ii) broad emission in the stacked [C II] spectrum, with velocities of |v|<~
500 km/s. The significance of these features increases when stacking the subset
of galaxies with star formation rates (SFRs) higher than the median (SFRmed =
25 Msun/yr), thus confirming their star-formation-driven nature. The estimated
mass outflow rates are comparable to the SFRs, yielding mass-loading factors of
the order of unity (similarly to local star-forming galaxies), suggesting that
star-formation-driven feedback may play a lesser role in quenching galaxies at
z > 4. From the stacking analysis of the datacubes, we find that the combined
[C II] core emission (|v|< 200 km/s) of the higher-SFR galaxies is extended on
physical sizes of ~ 30 kpc (diameter scale), well beyond the analogous [C II]
core emission of lower-SFR galaxies and the stacked far-infrared continuum. The
detection of such extended metal-enriched gas, likely tracing circumgalactic
gas enriched by past outflows, corroborates previous similar studies,
confirming that baryon cycle and gas exchanges with the circumgalactic medium

we find that MUSE detected galaxies have generally lower extinction than
SMUVS-only objects, while there is no clear intrinsic difference in the mass

instantaneous SFR lower limit given by Ly$\rm \alpha$ flux with its past

observe young, massive stars at the GC, with roughly 20-50\% of them in a disc,
mostly in the region where the bright giants appear to be lacking. In a
previous publication we put the idea forward that the missing stars are deeply
connected to the presence of this disc. The progenitor of the stellar disc is
very likely to have been a gaseous disc that at some point fragmented and
triggered star formation. This caused the appearance of overdensity regions in
the disc that had high enough densities to ensure stripping large giants of
their atmospheres and thus rendering them very faint. In this paper we use a
stellar evolution code to derive the properties that a red giant would display
in a colour-magnitude diagram, as well as a non-linearity factor required for a
correct estimate of the mass loss. We find that in a very short timescale, the
red giants (RGs) leave their standard evolutionary track. The non-linearity
factor has values that not only depend on the properties of the clumps, but
also on the physical conditions the giant stars, as we predicted analytically.
According to our results, envelope stripping works, moving stars on a short
timescale from the giant branch to the white dwarf stage, thus rendering them

The central clump is further resolved into two smaller northwestern and

root of the mass coordinate. Our results imply that stars can only become
supermassive by accretion at the rates of atomically cooled haloes

methods are knownto be extremely sensitive to algorithm initialization, relying
on the user to provide a reasonable starting curve to the algorithm. In the

well established by cosmological observables, its particle nature and
interactions with the rest of the matter are not known. We consider three dark
matter models that admit electromagnetic interaction between baryons and dark
matter: (a) milli-charged particle (CCDM) of charge $q_{\rm ccdm}$ and mass
$m_{\rm ccdm}$, (b) a neutral atom of two charged particles of mass $m_{\rm
dd}$ (DD), and (c) a neutral atom of doubly charged particle and helium nucleus
(HeD). We derive and discuss in detail the formation, stability, and
interaction of these atoms with baryons. We derive the implications of this new
interaction in the tight-coupling approximation, which allows us to
analytically gauge their impact on the matter power spectrum and CMB
anisotropy. We incorporate this new interaction into the publicly-available
code CLASS to obtain numerical results. We compare our results with Planck 2018
data to constrain the fraction of interacting dark matter. For the range of
allowed astrophysical parameters, the HeD atom yields the results of
$\Lambda$CDM model for $k < 1 \, \rm Mpc^{-1}$, and hence its fraction is not
constrained by CMB anisotropy data which is sensitive to $k < 0.2 \, \rm
Mpc^{-1}$. For $m_{\rm dd} \gtrsim 25 \, \rm GeV$, the DD atom is also not
constrained by CMB data. For $m_{\rm dd} = 10 \, \rm GeV$, the CMB data
constrains the fraction of DD atoms to be smaller than 4% of the total CDM
component. For $q_{\rm ccdm} = 10^{-6}e$ and $m_{\rm ccdm} = 50 \, \rm MeV$,
the CCDM fraction is constrained to be less than 1%.

important, yet challenging, in many real-world applications such as
location-based services (LBS), logistics and supply chain management,
transportation systems, map utilities, and so on. While many prior works aimed
to find a path between a source and a destination with the smallest traveling
distance/time, they do not take into account the quality constraints (e.g.,
obstacles) of the returned paths, such as uneven roads, roads under
construction, and weather conditions on roads. Inspired by this, in this paper,
we consider two types of ad-hoc obstacles, keyword-based and weather-based
obstacles, on road networks, which can be used for modeling roads that the
returned paths should not pass through. In the presence of such ad-hoc
obstacles on roads, we formulate a path routing query over road networks with
ad-hoc obstacles (PRAO), which retrieves paths from source to destination on
road networks that do not pass ad-hoc keyword and weather obstacles and have
the smallest traveling time. In order to efficiently answer PRAO queries, we
design effective pruning methods and indexing mechanism to facilitate efficient
PRAO query answering. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the efficiency
and effectiveness of our approaches over real/synthetic data sets.

merging black holes it has been suggested that their origin is primordial.
Appealingly, a sufficient number of primordial black holes (PBHs) could also
partially or entirely constitute the dark matter (DM) in the Universe. However,
recent studies on PBHs in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDGs) suggest that they
would dynamically heat up the stellar component due to two-body relaxation
processes. From the comparison with the observed stellar velocity dispersions
and the stellar half-light radii it was claimed that only PBHs with masses
$\lesssim10\,M_\odot$ can significantly contribute to the DM. In this work, we
improve the latter constraints by considering the largest observational sample
of UFDGs and by allowing the PBH masses to follow an extended (log-normal)
distribution. By means of collisional Fokker-Planck simulations, we explore a
wide parameter space of UFDGs containing PBHs. The analysis of the half-light
radii and velocity dispersions resulting from the simulations leads to three
general findings that exclude PBHs with masses
$\sim\mathcal{O}(1$-$100)\,M_\odot$ from constituting all of the DM: (i) We
identify a critical sub-sample of UFDGs that only allows for
$\sim\mathcal{O}(1)\,M_\odot$ PBH masses; (ii) for any PBH mass, there is an
UFDG in our sample that disfavours it; (iii) the spatial extensions of a
majority of simulated UFDGs containing PBHs are too large to match the
observed.

manipulate nanowires to create complex and highly conductive nanostructures
(paths) that work as nanoelectrodes, allowing connectivity and electrical
characterization of other nano-objects. The paths are formed by the spontaneous
cold welding of gold nanowires upon mechanical contact, leading to an excellent

circuits made by SPANC are easily reconfigurable, and their fabrication does
not require the use of polymers and chemicals. In this work, we present a few

vehicles and autonomous vehicles (AVs) will coexist in a mixed traffic for a
long time. To enable AVs to safely and efficiently maneuver in this mixed
traffic, it is critical that the AVs can understand how humans cope with risks
and make driving-related decisions. On the other hand, the driving environment
is highly dynamic and ever-changing, and it is thus difficult to enumerate all

this work, we incorporate a human decision-making model in reinforcement
learning to control AVs for safe and efficient operations. Specifically, we
adapt regret theory to describe a human driver's lane-changing behavior, and
fit the personalized models to individual drivers for predicting their
lane-changing decisions. The predicted decisions are incorporated in the safety
constraints for reinforcement learning in training and in implementation. We
then use an extended version of double deep Q-network (DDQN) to train our AV

field theory to describe distant points in moduli space. It is natural to ask
whether there is a local version of the SDC: is it possible to construct local
excitations in an EFT that sample extreme regions of moduli space? In many
cases such excitations exhibit horizons or instabilities, suggesting that there
are bounds on the size and structure of field excitations that can be achieved
in EFT. Static bubbles in ordinary Kaluza-Klein theory provide a simple class
of examples: the KK radius goes to zero on a smooth surface, locally probing an
infinite distance point, and the bubbles are classically unstable against
radial perturbations. However, it is also possible to stabilize KK bubbles at
the classical level by adding flux. We study the impact of imposing the Weak
Gravity Conjecture (WGC) on these solutions, finding that a rapid pair
production instability arises in the presence of charged matter with
$q/m\gtrsim 1$. We also analyze 4d electrically charged dilatonic black holes.
Small curvature at the horizon imposes a bound $\log(M_{BH})\gtrsim
|\Delta\phi|$, independent of the WGC, and the bound can be strengthened if the
particle satisfying the WGC is sufficiently light. We conjecture that quantum
gravity in asymptotically flat space requires a general bound on large
localized moduli space excursions of the form $ |\Delta\phi|\lesssim
|\log(R\Lambda)|$, where $R$ is the size of the minimal region enclosing the
excitation and $\Lambda^{-1}$ is the short-distance cutoff on local EFT. The
bound is qualitatively saturated by the dilatonic black holes and Kaluza-Klein
monopoles.

tasks such as five axis milling and laser cutting. We assume that a path
between a given start and end pose of the end effector is known which is

this process is called variational path optimization which is the systematic

ErrorNet corrects the segmentation mistakes by adding the predicted error map

dimensionless parameter at which the skyrmion radius diverges to infinity,

the expected transition point from the uniform phase, which accommodates the
skyrmion as an excited state, to the helical phase, which has negative energy.
We give the profile field at the skyrmion core, its outer field, and the
intermediate field at the skyrmion domain wall. Moreover, we derive an explicit
formula for the leading asymptotic behavior of the energy as well as the
leading term and first asymptotic correction for the value of the critical

exact formulae for the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the static
Landau-Lifshitz equation centered at the skyrmion domain wall. The skyrmion

used in epidemiological models that aim to simulate a specific epidemic.
Secondly, we continue by describing the development of a tree statistic, rooted

phylogenetic tree, by using the simulated epidemics. We show that the presented
tree statistic enables differentiation of epidemiological parameters, while
only relying on phylogenetic trees, thus enabling the construction of new

distribution networks and develops a decentralized state estimation algorithm
leveraging the matrix completion methodology. Matrix completion has been shown
to be an effective technique in state estimation that exploits the low
dimensionality of the power system measurements to recover missing information.
This technique can utilize an approximate (linear) load flow model, or it can
be used with no physical models in a network where no information about the
topology or line admittance is available.
  The direct application of matrix completion algorithms requires solving a
semi-definite programming (SDP) problem, which becomes infeasible for large
networks. We therefore develop a decentralized algorithm that capitalizes on
the popular proximal alternating direction method of multipliers (proximal
ADMM). The method allows us to distribute the computation among different areas
of the network, thus leading to a scalable algorithm. By doing all computations
at individual control areas and only communicating with neighboring areas, the
algorithm eliminates the need for data to be sent to a central processing unit
and thus increases efficiency and contributes to the goal of autonomous control
of distribution networks. We illustrate the advantages of the proposed
algorithm numerically using standard IEEE test cases.

disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Economics. These systems
are governed by interaction laws, which are often unknown: estimating them from
observation data is a fundamental task that can provide meaningful insights and
accurate predictions of the behaviour of the agents. In this paper, we consider
the inverse problem of learning interaction laws given data from multiple
trajectories, in a nonparametric fashion, when the interaction kernels depend
on pairwise distances. We establish a condition for learnability of interaction
kernels, and construct estimators that are guaranteed to converge in a suitable
$L^2$ space, at the optimal min-max rate for 1-dimensional nonparametric
regression. We propose an efficient learning algorithm based on least squares,
which can be implemented in parallel for multiple trajectories and is therefore
well-suited for the high dimensional, big data regime. Numerical simulations on
a variety examples, including opinion dynamics, predator-swarm dynamics and
heterogeneous particle dynamics, suggest that the learnability condition is
satisfied in models used in practice, and the rate of convergence of our
estimator is consistent with the theory. These simulations also suggest that
our estimators are robust to noise in the observations, and produce accurate
predictions of dynamics in relative large time intervals, even when they are
learned from data collected in short time intervals.

equations, we describe the dispersion in the nonretarded frequency regime of
the edge plasmon-polariton (EPP) on a semi-infinite flat sheet. The sheet has
an arbitrary, physically admissible, tensor valued and spatially homogeneous
conductivity, and serves as a model for a family of two-dimensional conducting
materials. We formulate a system of integral equations for the electric field
tangential to the sheet in a homogeneous and isotropic ambient medium. We show
how this system is simplified via a length scale separation. This view entails
the quasi-electrostatic approximation, by which the tangential electric field
is replaced by the gradient of a scalar potential, $\varphi$. By the
Wiener-Hopf method, we solve an integral equation for $\varphi$ in some
generality. The EPP dispersion relation comes from the elimination of a
divergent limiting Fourier integral for $\varphi$ at the edge. We connect the
existence, or lack thereof, of the EPP dispersion relation to the index for
Wiener-Hopf integral equations, an integer of topological character. We
indicate that the values of this index may express an asymmetry due to the
material anisotropy in the number of wave modes propagating on the sheet away
from the edge with respect to the EPP direction of propagation. We discuss
extensions such as the setting of two semi-infinite, coplanar sheets. Our
theory forms a generalization of the treatment by Volkov and Mikhailov (1988
Sov. Phys. JETP 67 1639).

(LBMs) have recently gained attention because they can be leveraged to perform
some computational tasks very efficiently. Although more error-resilient than
Boolean computing, p-bit based computing employing LBMs is, however, not
completely immune to defects and device-to-device variations. In some tasks
(e.g. binary stochastic neurons for machine learning and p-bits for population
coding), extended defects, such as variation of the LBM thickness over a
significant fraction of the surface, can impair functionality. In this paper,
we have examined if unavoidable geometric device-to-device variations can have
a significant effect on one of the most critical requirements for probabilistic
computing, namely the ability to ""program"" probability with an external agent,
such as a spin-polarized current injected into the LBM. We found that the
programming ability is fortunately not lost due to reasonable device-to-device
variations. The little variation in the probability versus current
characteristic that reasonable device variability causes can be suppressed
further by increasing the spin polarization of the current. This shows that
probabilistic computing with LBMs is robust against small geometric variations,
and hence will be ""scalable"" to a large number of p-bits.

and their uncertainties are important for documenting and understanding
historical changes in climate. A source of uncertainty that has not previously
been quantified in historical SST estimates stems from position errors. A
Bayesian inference framework is proposed for quantifying errors in reported
positions and their implications on SST estimates. The analysis framework is
applied to data from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set
(ICOADS3.0) in 1885, a time when astronomical and chronometer estimation of
position was common, but predating the use of radio signals. Focus is upon a
subset of 943 ship tracks from ICOADS3.0 that report their position every two
hours to a precision of 0.01{\deg} longitude and latitude. These data are
interpreted as positions determined by dead reckoning that are periodically
updated by celestial correction techniques. The posterior medians of
uncertainties in celestial correction are 33.1 km (0.30{\deg} on the equator)
in longitude and 24.4 km (0.22{\deg}) in latitude, respectively. The posterior
medians of two-hourly dead reckoning uncertainties are 19.2% for ship speed and
13.2{\deg} for ship heading, leading to random position uncertainties with
median 0.18{\deg} (20 km on the equator) in longitude and 0.15{\deg} (17 km) in
latitude. Reported ship tracks also contain systematic position uncertainties
relating to precursor dead-reckoning positions not being updated after
obtaining celestial position estimates, indicating that more accurate positions
can be provided for SST observations. Finally, we translate position errors
into SST uncertainties by sampling an ensemble of SSTs from the Multi-scale
Ultra-high resolution Sea Surface Temperature (MURSST) data set.

complexity. In addition, it may lead to non-minimal route and traffic imbalance

analysis of this bound system can reveal details about the underlying weak
interaction as it mirrors the helicity distributions of all outgoing particles.
Thus, it is unique in the information it carries, and an experiment unravelling
this information is an analogue to the Goldhaber experiment performed more than
60 years ago. The proposed experiment will search for monoenergetic metastable
BoB H atoms with 326 eV kinetic energy, which are generated at the center of a
throughgoing beamtube of a high-flux reactor (e.g., at the PIK reactor,
Gatchina). Although full spectroscopic information is needed to possibly reveal
new physics our first aim is to prove the occurrence of this decay and learn
about backgrounds. Key to the detection is the identification of a monoerergtic
line of hydrogen atoms occurring at a rate of about 1 $\rm{s}^{-1}$ in the
environment of many hydrogen atoms, however having a thermal distribution of
about room temperature. Two scenarios for velocity (energy) filtering are
discussed in this paper. The first builds on an purely electric chopper system,
in which metastable hydrogen atoms are quenched to their ground state and thus
remain mostly undetectable. This chopper system employs fast switchable
Bradbury Nielsen gates. The second method exploits a strongly energy dependent
charge exchange process of metastable hydrogen picking up an electron while
traversing an argon filled gas cell, turning it into manipulable charged

spacetime including an ideal cosmic string. In addition, spatial dimension
along the string is compactified to a circle of length $L$. The fermionic field
is assumed to obey quasi-periodic condition along the $z$-axis. There are also
magnetic fluxes running along the cosmic string and enclosed by the compact
dimension. Both, the FC and the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor, are
decomposed into two parts: one induced by the cosmic string in dS spacetime
considering the absence of the compactification, and another one induced by the
compactification. In particular, we show that the FC vanishes for a massless
fermionic field.

galaxy catalogues from the EAGLE suite. We analyze the merger rate per galaxy
of binary neutron stars (BNSs), black hole--neutron star binaries (BHNSs) and
binary black holes (BBHs) from redshift zero up to redshift six. The binary
merger rate per galaxy strongly correlates with the stellar mass of the host
galaxy at any redshift considered here. This correlation is significantly
steeper for BNSs than for both BHNSs and BBHs. Moreover, we find that the
merger rate per galaxy depends also on host galaxy's star formation rate and
metallicity. We derive a robust fitting formula that relates the merger rate
per galaxy with galaxy's star formation rate, stellar mass and metallicity at
different redshifts. The typical masses of the host galaxies increase
significantly as redshift decreases, as a consequence of the interplay between
delay time distribution of compact binaries and cosmic assembly of galaxies.
Finally, we study the evolution of the merger rate density with redshift. At
low redshift ($z\leq{}0.1$) early-type galaxies give a larger contribution to
the merger rate density than late-type galaxies. This trend reverts at
$z\ge{}1$.

possible to build a Jtr(H) phase diagram. There, in between the Meissner and

the vortices behave as Abrikosov-like ones, with velocities two orders of
magnitude lower than those at low fields regime. Besides that, one demonstrates
how the interplay between Jtr and the shielding currents, its controlled by H,
allowing for some quantitative predictions of boundaries in the phase diagram.
Additionally, for H's where only a kV is nucleated, for tenths of picoseconds,
a surface barrier effect acts over the instantaneous velocity of the kV.

ultra low power and high speed computing needed for future exascale
supercomputing systems. The combination of ultra high clock frequencies,
gate-level pipelines, and numerous sources of variability in SFQ circuits,
however, make low-skew global clock distribution a challenge. This motivates
the support of multiple independent clock domains and related clock domain
crossing circuits that enable reliable communication across domains. Existing
J-SIM simulation models indicate that setup violations can cause clock-to-Q
increases of up to 100%. This paper first shows that naive SFQ clock domain
crossing (CDC) first-in-first-out buffers (FIFOs) are vulnerable to these delay
increases, motivating the need for more robust CDC FIFOs. Inspired by CMOS
multi-flip-flop asynchronous FIFO synchronizers, we then propose a novel 1-bit
metastability-resilient SFQ CDC FIFO that simulations show delivers over a 1000
reduction in logical error rate at 30 GHz. Moreover, for a 10-stage FIFO, the
Josephson junction (JJ) area of our proposed design is only 7.5% larger than
the non-resilient counterpart. Finally, we propose design guidelines that
define the minimal FIFO depth subject to both throughput and burstiness
constraints.

perceptron) and its implementation as a standard cell. This new cell structure,
referred to as flash threshold logic (FTL), uses floating gate (flash)
transistors to realize the weights associated with a threshold function. The
threshold voltages of the flash transistors serve as a proxy for the weights.
An FTL cell can be equivalently viewed as a multi-input, edge-triggered
flipflop which computes a threshold function on a clock edge. Consequently, it
can be used in the automatic synthesis of ASICs. The use of flash transistors
in the FTL cell allows programming of the weights after fabrication, thereby
preventing discovery of its function by a foundry or by reverse engineering.
This paper focuses on the design and characteristics of the FTL cell. We
present a novel method for programming the weights of an FTL cell for a
specified threshold function using a modified perceptron learning algorithm.
The algorithm is further extended to select weights to maximize the robustness
of the design in the presence of process variations. The FTL circuit was
designed in 40nm technology and simulations with layout-extracted parasitics
included, demonstrate significant improvements in the area (79.7%), power
(61.1%), and performance (42.5%) when compared to the equivalent
implementations of the same function in conventional static CMOS design. Weight
selection targeting robustness is demonstrated using Monte Carlo simulations.
The paper also shows how FTL cells can be used for fixing timing errors after
fabrication.

  Applications","To appear in SODA 2020",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal of this paper is to get truly subcubic algorithms for Min-Plus
product for less structured inputs than what was previously known, and to apply
them to versions of All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) and other problems. The
results are as follows:
  (1) Our main result is the first truly subcubic algorithm for the Min-Plus
product of two $n\times n$ matrices $A$ and $B$ with $\text{polylog}(n)$ bit
integer entries, where $B$ has a partitioning into $n^{\epsilon}\times
n^{\epsilon}$ blocks (for any $\epsilon>0$) where each block is at most
$n^\delta$-far (for $\delta<3-\omega$, where $2\leq \omega<2.373$) in
$\ell_\infty$ norm from a constant rank integer matrix. This result presents
the most general case to date of Min-Plus product that is solvable in truly
subcubic time.
  (2) The first application of our main result is a truly subcubic algorithm
for APSP in a new type of geometric graph. Our result extends the result of
Chan'10 in the case of integer edge weights by allowing the weights to differ
from a function of the end-point identities by at most $n^\delta$ for small
$\delta$.
  (3) In the second application we consider a batch version of the range mode
problem in which one is given a length $n$ sequence and $n$ contiguous
subsequences, and one is asked to compute the range mode of each subsequence.
We give the first $O(n^{1.5-\epsilon})$ time for $\epsilon>0$ algorithm for
this batch range mode problem.
  (4) Our final application is to the Maximum Subarray problem: given an
$n\times n$ integer matrix, find the contiguous subarray of maximum entry sum.
We show that Maximum Subarray can be solved in truly subcubic,
$O(n^{3-\epsilon})$ (for $\epsilon>0$) time, as long as the entries are no
larger than $O(n^{0.62})$ in absolute value.
  We also improve all the known conditional hardness results for the
$d$-dimensional variant of Maximum Subarray.

nuclei (AGN), a geometrically and optically thick torus of gas and dust is
required to obscure the central engine depending on the line of sight to the
observer. We perform a simultaneous fitting of X-ray and mid-infrared (mid-IR)
spectra to investigate if the same structure could produce both emissions and,
if this the case, to obtain better constraints for the physical parameters of
the torus. In this case, we take advantage of the fact that both emissions show
important signatures of obscuration. We used the nearby type-2 active nucleus
IC 5063 as a test object. This object is ideal because of the wealth of
archival data including some high resolution data. It also has a relatively
high AGN luminosity that dominates at both X-ray and mid-IR frequencies. We use
high spectral resolution NuSTAR and IRS/Spitzer spectra. The AGN dusty models
used several physically motivated models. We found that the combination of the
smooth torus models at mid-IR by Fritz et al. (2006) and at X-rays by
Balokovi\'c et al. (2018), with the viewing and half-opening angles linked to
the same value, is the best choice to fit the spectra at both wavelengths. This
allows us to determine all the parameters of its torus. This result suggests
that the structure producing the continuum emission at mid-IR and the
reflection component at X-ray is the same. Therefore, we prove that this
technique can be used to infer the physical properties of the torus, at least
when AGN dust dominates the mid-IR emission and the reflection component is
significant at X-rays.

  Phonon Size Effects to Wave Effects",,,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tailoring thermal properties with nanostructured materials can be of vital
importance for many applications. Generally classical phonon size effects are
employed to reduce the thermal conductivity, where strong phonon scattering by
nanostructured interfaces or boundaries can dramatically supress the heat
conduction. When these boundaries or interfaces are arranged in a periodic
pattern, coherent phonons may have interference and modify the phonon
dispersion, leading to dramatically reduced thermal conductivity. Such coherent
phonon transport has been widely studied for superlattice films and recently
emphasized for periodic nanoporous patterns. Although the wave effects have
been proposed for reducing the thermal conductivity, more recent experimental
evidence shows that such effects can only be critical at an ultralow
temperature, i.e., around 10 K or below. At room temperature, the impacted
phonons are mostly restricted to hypersonic modes that contribute little to the
thermal conductivity. In this review, the theoretical and experimental studies
of periodic porous structures are summarized and compared. The general
applications of periodic nanostructured materials are further discussed.

binary allocation variables are learned jointly with the model parameters by
standard back-propagation thanks to the Gumbel-Softmax reparametrization

Mrk\,622 showing different aspects of the nuclear emission region is presented.
Radio, near- and mid-infrared, optical and X-ray data has been considered for
the analysis. In the optical, the WHAN diagnostic diagrams show that the three
nuclear peaks are strong active galactic nuclei since the EW of $H{\alpha}$ is
$>$\,6 \AA\, and $\log$ [NII]$\lambda$6584/H$\alpha$\, ratio is $>$\,-0.4.
Optical variability of both the continuum flux and intensity of the narrow
emission lines is detected in a time-span of 13 years. The size of the narrow
line region is found to be 2.7\,pc, with a light-crossing time of 8.7\,y.
Analysis done to an archival Hubble Space Telescope image at 1055.2\,nm shows
that the host galaxy has a 3.6\,kpc inner bar with PA\,=\,74$^\circ$, faint
spiral arms and a pseudobulge, evolving through secular processes. High
resolution mid-infrared images obtained with the \textit{Gran Telescopio
Canarias (GTC)} and the instrument \textit{CanariCam} show that the nuclear
emission at 11.6 $\mu$m is not spatially resolved. Very Large Array archival
observations at 10\,GHz reveal a core source with a total flux density of
1.47\,$\pm$\,0.03\,mJy. The spectral index of the core between 8 and 12\,GHz is
-0.5\,$\pm$\,0.2, characteristic of AGN. The core deconvolves into a source
with dimensions of 82\,$\pm$\,13\,mas\,$\,\times\,$\,41\,$\pm$\,20\,mas, and a
PA\,=\,70\,$\pm$\,18\,deg; which suggests that the core is elongated or that it
is constituted by multiple components distributed along a $\sim$65$^\circ$
axis.

defined to slide along the contour for measuring the synchronised patterns of
exterior shape and interior appearance of soybean leaf images. A multiscale

  and Efficient Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Diabetes impacts the quality of life of millions of people. However, diabetes
diagnosis is still an arduous process, given that the disease develops and gets
treated outside the clinic. The emergence of wearable medical sensors (WMSs)
and machine learning points to a way forward to address this challenge. WMSs
enable a continuous mechanism to collect and analyze physiological signals.
However, disease diagnosis based on WMS data and its effective deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices remain challenging due to inefficient feature
extraction and vast computation cost. In this work, we propose a framework
called DiabDeep that combines efficient neural networks (called DiabNNs) with
WMSs for pervasive diabetes diagnosis. DiabDeep bypasses the feature extraction
stage and acts directly on WMS data. It enables both an (i) accurate inference
on the server, e.g., a desktop, and (ii) efficient inference on an edge device,
e.g., a smartphone, based on varying design goals and resource budgets. On the
server, we stack sparsely connected layers to deliver high accuracy. On the
edge, we use a hidden-layer long short-term memory based recurrent layer to cut
down on computation and storage. At the core of DiabDeep lies a grow-and-prune
training flow: it leverages gradient-based growth and magnitude-based pruning
algorithms to learn both weights and connections for DiabNNs. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of DiabDeep through analyzing data from 52 participants. For
server (edge) side inference, we achieve a 96.3% (95.3%) accuracy in
classifying diabetics against healthy individuals, and a 95.7% (94.6%) accuracy
in distinguishing among type-1/type-2 diabetic, and healthy individuals.
Against conventional baselines, DiabNNs achieve higher accuracy, while reducing
the model size (FLOPs) by up to 454.5x (8.9x). Therefore, the system can be
viewed as pervasive and efficient, yet very accurate.

machine learning and randomized algorithms rely on uniform bounds on quadratic
forms of random vectors or matrices. Such results include the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss (J-L) Lemma, the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP),
randomized sketching algorithms, and approximate linear algebra. The existing
results critically depend on statistical independence, e.g., independent

we show that such independence is in fact not needed for such results which
continue to hold under fairly general dependence structures. In particular, we
present uniform bounds on random quadratic forms of stochastic processes which
are conditionally independent and sub-Gaussian given another (latent) process.
Our setup allows general dependencies of the stochastic process on the history
of the latent process and the latent process to be influenced by realizations
of the stochastic process. The results are thus applicable to adaptive modeling
settings and also allows for sequential design of random vectors and matrices.
We also discuss stochastic process based forms of J-L, RIP, and sketching, to

associated with a candidate set of actuator locations. These system
realizations are then used to determine the actuator location among the set
that can drive the system output to an arbitrary value with minimal control
effort. The solution of the corresponding minimum energy optimal control
problem is evaluated by computing the generalized output controllability
Gramian. We use the method to analyze high-fidelity numerical simulation data
of the lift and separation-angle responses to a pulse of localized body-force
actuation from six distinct locations on the upper surface of a NACA 65(1)-412
airfoil. We find that the optimal location for controlling lift is different
from the optimal location for controlling separation angle. In order to explain
the physical mechanisms underlying these differences, we conduct
controllability analyses of the flowfield by leveraging the dynamic mode
decomposition with control algorithm. These modal analyses of flowfield
response data reveal that excitation of coherent structures in the wake benefit
lift control; whereas, excitation of coherent structures in the shear layer
benefit separation-angle control.

constant approximation for the k -means objective, while having asymptotic

practical wireless systems. With CDM-based random access, a set of sequences is
reserved for random access. A remote station transmits a random access packet
using a randomly selected sequence among the set. If more than one remote
stations transmit random access packets using the same sequence simultaneously,
performance degrades due to sequence collision. In addition, if more than one
remote stations transmit random access packets using different sequences
simultaneously, performance also degrades due to interference. Therefore, the
performance of CDM-based random access is dependent on both sequence collision
and interference. There has been no previous research to analyze the
performance of CDM-based random access considering both sequence collision and
interference. In this paper, throughput of CDM-based random access is
investigated considering both sequence collision and interference based on a
signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) capture model. Analysis and
numerical simulation compare the throughputs of several random access schemes

that channel-adaptive random access can achieve significantly higher throughput

number of potential feature points and improves the robustness of multiscale
feature point recognition. On this basis, a feature enhancement algorithm based
on user priori guidance is proposed that adjusts the coordinates of the feature

neighborhood point coordinates, the above objective equation can be converted
into linear sparse equations with enhanced feature positions as variables, and
thus, the closed solution can be obtained. In addition, a parameterization
method for scattered point clouds based on feature line guidance is proposed,
which reduces the number of unknowns by 2/3 and eliminates lateral sliding in

means to accumulate computation progress across power cycles and recover system

task execution to improve computation progress and ensuring data consistency
without system suspension during runtime, by leveraging the characteristics of
data accessed in hybrid memory. We integrated the design into FreeRTOS running

still accumulate progress when the power source is too weak for
checkpointing-based approaches to make progress, and improves the computation
progress by up to 43% under a relatively strong power source, while reducing
the recovery time by at least 90%.

guess obtained by a sample-and-search based planner facilitates the numerical
optimization process, it is still far from being as fast as real-time. To
address this issue, we replace all of the collision-avoidance constraints by
series of within-tunnel conditions. Concretely, we develop a tunnel-based
strategy such that the vehicle is restricted to move within the tunnels which
naturally separate the vehicle from the obstacles. Unification, efficiency, and

realization of robust, joint 6D pose estimation of multiple instances of

first objective is to learn semantic and instance-boundary detectors without
manual labeling. An adversarial training framework in conjunction with
physics-based simulation is used to achieve detectors that behave similarly in
synthetic and real data. Given the stochastic output of such detectors,
candidates for object poses are sampled. The second objective is to
automatically learn a single score for each pose candidate that represents its
quality in terms of explaining the entire scene via a gradient boosted tree.
The proposed method uses features derived from surface and boundary alignment
between the observed scene and the object model placed at hypothesized poses.
Scene-level, multi-instance pose estimation is then achieved by an integer
linear programming process that selects hypotheses that maximize the sum of the
learned individual scores, while respecting constraints, such as avoiding
collisions. To evaluate this method, a dataset of densely packed objects with
challenging setups for state-of-the-art approaches is collected. Experiments on
this dataset and a public one show that the method significantly outperforms
alternatives in terms of 6D pose accuracy while trained only with synthetic

said to be one of the solutions to the problem. In the present paper, we
propose a new method for frequency control with energy storage systems (ESS),

Nadir during transients. Nadir elimination allows us to perform frequency
stability assessment without the need for direct numerical simulations of
system dynamics. We make a direct comparison of our developed strategy with the
usual control approaches --virtual inertia (VI) and droop control (DC)-- and
show that iDroop is more effective than both in eliminating the Nadir. More
precisely, iDroop achieves the Nadir elimination under significantly lower
gains than virtual inertia and requires almost $40\%$ less storage power
capacity to implement the control. Moreover, we show that rather unrealistic

learning, especially for data privacy-sensitive scenarios. Existing federated
learning mostly adopts the central server-based architecture or centralized
architecture. However, in many social network scenarios, centralized federated
learning is not applicable (e.g., a central agent or server connecting all
users may not exist, or the communication cost to the central server is not
affordable). In this paper, we consider a generic setting: 1) the central
server may not exist, and 2) the social network is unidirectional or of
single-sided trust (i.e., user A trusts user B but user B may not trust user
A). We propose a central server free federated learning algorithm, named Online
Push-Sum (OPS) method, to handle this challenging but generic scenario. A
rigorous regret analysis is also provided, which shows very interesting results
on how users can benefit from communication with trusted users in the federated
learning scenario. This work builds upon the fundamental algorithm framework
and theoretical guarantees for federated learning in the generic social network
scenario.

improving the security of our computer systems. Hardware offers many advantages
over pure software approaches: immutability of mechanisms to software attacks,
better execution and power efficiency and a smaller interface allowing it to
better maintain secrets. This has given birth to a plethora of hardware
mechanisms providing trusted execution environments (TEEs), support for
integrity checking and memory safety and widespread uses of hardware roots of
trust.
  In this paper, we systematize these approaches through the lens of
abstraction. Abstraction is key to computing systems, and the interface between
hardware and software contains many abstractions. We find that these
abstractions, when poorly designed, can both obscure information that is needed
for security enforcement, as well as reveal information that needs to be kept

Current solutions in the field -- mainly dominated by CNNs, GCNs and LSTMs --
often consist of complicated architectures and mechanisms to embed the
relationships between the two persons on the architecture itself, to ensure the
interaction patterns can be properly learned. Our main contribution with this
work is by proposing a simpler yet very powerful architecture, named
Interaction Relational Network, which utilizes minimal prior knowledge about
the structure of the human body. We drive the network to identify by itself how
to relate the body parts from the individuals interacting. In order to better
represent the interaction, we define two different relationships, leading to
specialized architectures and models for each. These multiple relationship
models will then be fused into a single and special architecture, in order to
leverage both streams of information for further enhancing the relational
reasoning capability. Furthermore we define important structured pair-wise
operations to extract meaningful extra information from each pair of joints --
distance and motion. Ultimately, with the coupling of an LSTM, our IRN is
capable of paramount sequential relational reasoning. These important
extensions we made to our network can also be valuable to other problems that
require sophisticated relational reasoning. Our solution is able to achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the traditional interaction recognition

random measure of interest--for example, the empirical population measure of
types in a Wright-Fisher model--and a Dirichlet process, which is a measure
having Poisson-Dirichlet distributed atoms with i.i.d. labels from a diffuse
distribution. The implicit metric of the approximation theorem captures the
sizes and locations of the masses, and so also yields bounds on the
approximation between the masses of the measure of interest and the
Poisson-Dirichlet distribution. We apply the result to bound the error in the
approximation of the stationary distribution of types in the finite
Wright-Fisher model with infinite-alleles mutation structure (not necessarily
parent independent) by the Poisson-Dirichlet distribution. An important
consequence of our result is an explicit upper bound on the total variation
distance between the random partition generated by sampling from a finite
Wright-Fisher stationary distribution, and the Ewens Sampling Formula. The
bound is small if the sample size $n$ is much smaller than
$N^{1/6}\log(N)^{-1/2}$, where $N$ is the total population size. Our analysis
requires a result of separate interest, giving an explicit bound on the second
moment of the number of types of a finite Wright-Fisher stationary
distribution. The general approximation result follows from a new development
of Stein's method for the Dirichlet process, which follows by viewing the
Dirichlet process as the stationary distribution of a Fleming-Viot process, and
then applying Barbour's generator approach.

efficient acceleration in the consecutive acceleration stage(s), depends
collectively on the parameters of the injected electron beam, the booster

To be published in the Memoirs of the AMS",,,,"math.DS math-ph math.MP math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Lorentz gas is one of the simplest and most widely-studied models for
particle transport in matter. It describes a cloud of non-interacting gas
particles in an infinitely extended array of identical spherical scatterers.
The model was introduced by Lorentz in 1905 who, following the pioneering ideas
of Maxwell and Boltzmann, postulated that in the limit of low scatterer
density, the macroscopic transport properties of the model should be governed
by a linear Boltzmann equation. The linear Boltzmann equation has since proved
a useful tool in the description of various phenomena, including semiconductor
physics and radiative transfer. A rigorous derivation of the linear Boltzmann
equation from the underlying particle dynamics was given, for random scatterer
configurations, in three seminal papers by Gallavotti, Spohn and
Boldrighini-Bunimovich-Sinai. The objective of the present study is to develop
an approach for a large class of deterministic scatterer configurations,
including various types of quasicrystals. We prove the convergence of the
particle dynamics to transport processes that are in general (depending on the
scatterer configuration) not described by the linear Boltzmann equation. This
was previously understood only in the case of the periodic Lorentz gas through
work of Caglioti-Golse and Marklof-Str\""ombergsson. Our results extend beyond
the classical Lorentz gas with hard sphere scatterers, and in particular hold
for general classes of spherically symmetric finite-range potentials. We employ
a rescaling technique that randomises the point configuration given by the
scatterers' centers. The limiting transport process is then expressed in terms
of a point process that arises as the limit of the randomised point
configuration under a certain volume-preserving one-parameter linear group
action.

of state vectors to self-test a maximally entangled state. We present a
geometrical proof in the case of partially entangled states. We show that, when
a set of correlators in the simplest Bell scenario satisfies a condition, the
geometry of the state vectors is uniquely determined. The realization becomes
self-testable when another unitary observable exists on the geometry. Applying
this proven fact, we propose self-testing protocols by intentionally adding one
more measurement. This geometrical scheme for self-testing is superior in that,
by using this as a building block and repeatedly adding measurements, a
realization with an arbitrary number of measurements can be self-tested.
Besides the application, we also attempt to describe nonlocal correlations by
guessing probabilities of distant measurement outcomes. In this description,
the quantum set is also convex, and a large class of extremal points is

Riemannian manifold. The problem consists of finding non-intersecting
trajectories between the agent and prescribed obstacles on the workspace, among
a set of admissible curves, to reach a specified configuration, based on
minimizing an energy functional that depends on the velocity, covariant
acceleration and an artificial potential function used to prevent collision
with the obstacles and among the agents. We apply the results to examples of a
planar rigid body, and collision and obstacle avoidance for agents evolving on
a sphere.

Existing inspection systems make use of handcrafted filter chains and feature

paper, we propose to formulate AFP defect detection as an image segmentation
problem that can be solved in an end-to-end fashion using artificially

from the centre (depending on event geometry). For a central chord and assumed
ring plane, the separated features are 298.5 to 302 and 308 to 310.5 km from
the nucleus, with normal optical depth approximately 0.5-0.9, and a gap of
9.1+/-1.3 km. These features are similar in equivalent depth to Chariklo's
inner ring. The absence of absorbing or scattering material near the nucleus
suggests that these sharp dips are more likely to be planar rings than a shell
of material. The region of relatively-increased transmission is within the 1:2
spin-orbit resonance, which is consistent with the proposed clearing pattern

different kinds of dry electrodes, including gold, stainless steel, carbon
rubber and metallized textile as contact materials are proposed. All test
electrodes are based on a circular printed circuit board as carrier and have
the same contact surface dimensions. To compare the electrodes'
characteristics, the occurring electrode-skin impedances are measured under
variation of signal frequency, contact duration, contact pressure, placement
position and subjects. Additionally, all measurements are performed with
silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) hydrogel electrodes for comparison purposes.
Main results: The analysed parameters play a significant role regarding the
electrode-skin impedance. Choosing a wise setup of these parameters can
decrease the electrode-skin impedance of dry electrodes down to ranges of
hydrogel electrodes and even below. Significance: The usage of dry electrodes
is one of the most difficult challenges when transferring scientific
measurement techniques to clinical environments or commercial products but it
is indispensable for many applications like body composition measurements or

existing reading comprehension datasets is that each triple (Passage, Question,
Answer) in BiPaR is written parallelly in two languages. We collect 3,667
bilingual parallel paragraphs from Chinese and English novels, from which we
construct 14,668 parallel question-answer pairs via crowdsourced workers
following a strict quality control procedure. We analyze BiPaR in depth and
find that BiPaR offers good diversification in prefixes of questions, answer
types and relationships between questions and passages. We also observe that
answering questions of novels requires reading comprehension skills of
coreference resolution, multi-sentence reasoning, and understanding of implicit
causality, etc. With BiPaR, we build monolingual, multilingual, and
cross-lingual MRC baseline models. Even for the relatively simple monolingual
MRC on this dataset, experiments show that a strong BERT baseline is over 30
points behind human in terms of both EM and F1 score, indicating that BiPaR
provides a challenging testbed for monolingual, multilingual and cross-lingual
MRC on novels. The dataset is available at https://multinlp.github.io/BiPaR/.

cost-efficient synthetic method enabling the nanostructuring of advanced
functional materials in steady conditions, i.e. not in batch synthesis. In this
paper, we use CHFS to crystallize NiCo- and NiFe-hydroxides in water solution
with 2D nanofeatures. By tuning the synthetic parameters, we disclose the key
role of the cation redox chemistry in the transition between two competitive
phases: from 2D-nanoplatelets of brucite to layered double hydroxides (LDH).
For controlling the precipitation of different Ni, Fe, Co-hydroxide phases, we
propose the combined use of an oxidizing (H2O2) and a complexing (NH3) agent.
At temperatures as low as 80 {\deg}C, the presence of H2O2 and a low
concentration of NH3 favour the Ni2+/Co3+ over Ni2+/Co2+ oxidation states,
shifting the product structure from brucite phase (temperatures > 80 {\deg}C)
to LDH. Conversely, for the NiFe-hydroxides the transition from LDH
(temperatures < 80 {\deg}C) to brucite phase (temperatures > 80 {\deg}C) is
controlled by the reaction temperature only. Due to the high stability of Fe3+,
the synthesis of NiFe products by CHFS does not require oxidizing and
complexing agents, resulting in a robust process for large-scale production.

engineered noisy system, whereby the response to a periodic forcing is greatly
amplified when the intensity of the noise is tuned to within a specific range
of values. We propose here a general mathematical framework based on large
deviation theory, and, specifically, on the theory of quasi-potentials, for
describing SR in noisy N-dimensional non-equilibrium systems possessing two
metastable states and undergoing a periodically modulated forcing. The drift
and the volatility fields of the equations of motion can be fairly general and
the competing attractors of the deterministic dynamics and the edge state
living on the basin boundary can, in principle, feature chaotic dynamics.
Similarly, the perturbation field of the forcing can be fairly general. Our
approach is able to recover as special cases the classical results previously
presented in the literature for systems obeying detailed balance and allows for
expressing the parameters describing SR and the statistics of residence times
in the two-state approximation in terms of the unperturbed drift field, the
volatility field, and the perturbation field. We clarify which specific
properties of the forcing are relevant for amplifying or suppressing SR in a
system, and classify forcings according to classes of equivalence. Our results
indicate a route for a detailed understanding of SR in rather general systems.

discussed in the context of supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation and
evolution, providing a possible explanation for the presence of massive quasars
at high redshifts (z$\gtrsim$7), as well as having implications for SMBH growth
at later epochs. However, it is currently unclear whether such
`super-Eddington' accretion occurs in SMBHs at all, how common it is, or
whether every SMBH may experience it. In this work, we investigate the
observational consequences of a simplistic model for super-Eddington accretion
flows -- an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disc (AD) where the
inner-most parts experience severe photon-trapping, which is enhanced with
increased accretion rate. The resulting spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
show a dramatic lack of rest-frame UV, or even optical, photons. Using a grid
of model SEDs spanning a wide range in parameter space (including SMBH mass and
accretion rate), we find that large optical quasar surveys (such as SDSS) may
be missing most of these luminous systems. We then propose a set of colour
selection criteria across optical and infra-red colour spaces designed to
select super-Eddington SEDs in both wide-field surveys (e.g., using SDSS, 2MASS
and WISE) and deep & narrow-field surveys (e.g., COSMOS). The proposed
selection criteria are a necessary first step in establishing the relevance of
advection-affected super-Eddington accretion onto SMBHs at early cosmic epochs.

complexity explosion in radio resource management (RRM). On the one hand, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) provides a powerful tool for scalable optimization
for high dimensional RRM problems in a dynamic environment. On the other hand,
DRL algorithms consume a high amount of energy over time and risk compromising
progress made in green radio research. This paper reviews and analyzes how to
achieve green DRL for RRM via both architecture and algorithm innovations.
Architecturally, a cloud based training and distributed decision-making DRL
scheme is proposed, where RRM entities can make lightweight deep local
decisions whilst assisted by on-cloud training and updating. On the algorithm
level, compression approaches are introduced for both deep neural networks and
the underlying Markov Decision Processes, enabling accurate low-dimensional
representations of challenges. To scale learning across geographic areas, a
spatial transfer learning scheme is proposed to further promote the learning
efficiency of distributed DRL entities by exploiting the traffic demand

the leading instrument for the transient detection and their first
localisation. The sensitivity of such instruments is usually limited by the
background, either of instrumental or astrophysical origin. Detailed
estimations of the background are obtained by simulating the interaction of
particles with the matter using, in the present case, the GEANT4 Monte-Carlo
toolkit. However, this is a time consuming process, especially when it is
needed to carry out all possible geometrical and orbital configurations.
Instead, we present a much faster method that allows computing the background
in either a static or dynamic (time dependent) way. The method is based on the
preliminary calculation of a large particle database using the GEANT4 toolkit
followed by a selection process based on the incoming direction and energy of
the particles. This approach is as accurate as direct Monte-Carlo methods,
while it reduces the computation time by a factor of $10^3 - 10^4$ for our
application. We apply this method to compute the SVOM/ECLAIRs dynamic

to two physical effects: selective extinction by dust grains aligned with the

reflection and transmission coefficients of the reflecting and refracting
surfaces in an optical system depend on the polarization of incoming rays, this
optical polarization produces both (a) a selection bias in favor of galaxies
with specific orientations and (b) a polarization-dependent PSF. In this work
we build toy models to obtain for the first time an estimate for the impact of
polarization on PSF shapes and the impact of the selection bias due to the
polarization effect on the measurement of the ellipticity used in shear
measurements. In particular, we are interested in determining if this effect
will be significant for WFIRST. We show that the systematic uncertainties in
the ellipticity components are $8\times 10^{-5}$ and $1.1 \times 10^{-4}$ due
to the selection bias and PSF errors respectively. Compared to the overall
requirements on knowledge of the WFIRST PSF ellipticity ($4.7\times 10^{-4}$

We present
a theory, instantiated in a computational model, based on the idea that
cross-domain generalization in humans is a case of analogical inference over
structured (i.e., symbolic) relational representations. The model is an
extension of the LISA and DORA models of relational inference and learning. The
resulting model learns both the content and format (i.e., structure) of
relational representations from non-relational inputs without supervision, when
augmented with the capacity for reinforcement learning, leverages these
representations to learn individual domains, and then generalizes to new
domains on the first exposure (i.e., zero-shot learning) via analogical
inference. We demonstrate the capacity of the model to learn structured
relational representations from a variety of simple visual stimuli, and to
perform cross-domain generalization between video games (Breakout and Pong) and
between several psychological tasks. We demonstrate that the model's trajectory
closely mirrors the trajectory of children as they learn about relations,
accounting for phenomena from the literature on the development of children's
reasoning and analogy making. The model's ability to generalize between domains
demonstrates the flexibility afforded by representing domains in terms of their
underlying relational structure, rather than simply in terms of the statistical
relations between their inputs and outputs.

previously reported atomic sodium and molecular OH mini-BAL (Broad Absorption

outflows are at kilo-parsec scales. Such large-scale outflows should produce
emission lines. We indeed find that high-ionization emission lines ([O III],
[Ne III], and [Ne V]) are dominated by blueshifted components at similar speeds
to the mini-BALs. The blueshifted components are also detected in some
low-ionization emission lines, such as [O II] $\lambda$3727 and some Balmer
lines (H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and H$\gamma$), even though their cores are
dominated by narrow ($FWHM_{\rm NEL} = 570\pm40$km s$^{-1}$) or broad
components at the systemic redshift of $z=0.18966\pm0.00006$. The mass flow
rate (230-730$~M_\odot \rm yr^{-1}$) and the kinetic luminosity ($\dot{E}_k
\sim 10^{43.6-44.8} $erg s$^{-1}$) are then inferred jointly from the
blueshifted emission and absorption lines. In the NIR spectrum of F11119+3257,
we also find that the Paschen emission lines are unique, in which a very narrow
($FWHM=260\pm20~$km s$^{-1}$) component is shown in only Pa$\alpha$. This
narrow component most probably comes from heavily obscured star formation.
Based on the Pa$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$ emissions, we obtain an extinction at the
$H$ band, $A_H~>~2.1$ (or a reddenning of $E_{B-V}~>~$3.7), and a star
formation rate of $SFR~>~130\rm M_\odot yr^{-1}$ that resembles the estimates
inferred from the FIR emissions ($SFR_{\rm FIR} = 190\pm90$ $M_\odot$

naturally share supervision signals with others. To tackle these issues, we
propose an innovative multi-task learning framework where a pointer-equipped
semantic parsing model is designed to resolve coreference in conversations, and
naturally empower joint learning with a novel type-aware entity detection
model. The proposed framework thus enables shared supervisions and alleviates
the effect of error propagation. Experiments on a large-scale conversational
question answering dataset containing 1.6M question answering pairs over 12.8M

impending retirement waves, negative population growth, or a suboptimal
distribution of resources across medical sectors even before the pandemic
struck. Current quantitative models are often of limited usability as they
either require extensive individual-level data to be properly calibrated or (in
the absence of such data) become too simplistic to capture key demographic
changes or disruptive epidemiological shocks like the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We
propose a novel population-dynamical and stock-flow-consistent approach to
health workforce supply forecasting that is complex enough to address
dynamically changing behaviors while requiring only publicly available
timeseries data for complete calibration. We demonstrate the usefulness of this
model by applying it to 21 European countries to forecast the supply of
generalist and specialist physicians until 2040, as well as how Covid-related
mortality and increased healthcare utilization might impact this supply.
Compared to staffing levels required to keep the physician density constant at
2019 levels, we find that in many countries there is indeed a significant trend
toward decreasing density for generalist physicians at the expense of
increasing densities for specialists. The trends for specialists are
exacerbated in many Southern and Eastern European countries by expectations of
negative population growth. Compared to the expected demographic changes in the
population and the health workforce, we expect a limited impact of Covid on
these trends even under conservative modelling assumptions. It is of the utmost
importance to devise tools for decision makers to influence the allocation and
supply of physicians across fields and sectors to combat these imbalances.

in the high-mass star-forming region AFGL 2591, which is a target region of the
NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) large program CORE. Using NOEMA
observations at 1.37 mm with an angular resolution of ~0.""42 (1 400 au at 3.33
kpc), we derived the physical and chemical structure of the source. We modeled
the observed molecular abundances with the chemical evolution code MUSCLE
(MUlti Stage ChemicaL codE). Results. With the kinetic temperature tracers
CH3CN and H2CO we observe a temperature distribution with a power-law index of
q = 0.41+-0.08. Using the visibilities of the continuum emission we derive a
density structure with a power-law index of p = 1.7+-0.1. The hot core spectra
reveal high molecular abundances and a rich diversity in complex molecules. The
majority of the molecules have an asymmetric spatial distribution around the
forming protostar(s), which indicates a complex physical structure on scales <
1 400 au. Using MUSCLE, we are able to explain the observed molecular abundance
of 10 out of 14 modeled species at an estimated hot core chemical age of ~21
100 years. In contrast to the observational analysis, our chemical modeling
predicts a lower density power-law index of p < 1.4. Reasons for this
discrepancy are discussed. Conclusions. Combining high spatial resolution
observations with detailed chemical modeling allows us to derive a concise
picture of the physical and chemical structure of the famous AFGL 2591 hot
core. The next steps are to conduct a similar analysis for the whole CORE
sample, and then use this analysis to constrain the chemical diversity in
high-mass star formation to a much greater depth.

choice based on theoretical arguments and simply fit the corresponding

give similar results and provide almost equivalent results. Model selection can
be more complicated when the goal is to describe a trend in the distribution of

to represent by a single distributional form. As an alternative to the use of
complicated families of distributions as models for data, the S-distribution

mathematical form in which the density is defined as a function of the

provide an infinity of new possibilities that do not correspond with known
classical distributions. In this paper we obtain an analytical solution for the
quantile equation that highly simplifies the use of S-distributions. We show
the utility of this solution in different applications. After classifying the
different qualitative behaviors of the S-distribution in parameter space, we
show how to obtain different S-distributions that accomplish specific
constraints. One interesting case is the possibility of obtaining distributions
that acomplish P(X <= X_c)=0. Then, we show that the quantile solution
facilitates the use of S-distributions in Monte-Carlo experiments through the

Recently, the notion of non-coherence-generating-and-detecting (NCGD) dynamics
has been introduced and related to the classicality of the statistics
associated with sequential measurements at different times. However, in order
for a dynamics to be NCGD, its propagators need to satisfy a given set of
conditions for all triples of consecutive times. We reduce this to a finite set
of $d(d-1)$ conditions, where $d$ is the dimension of the quantum system,

for the more general time-dependent case. The application of this result to the

there is the de-orbiting of decommissioned satellites. Guidelines for
re-entering objects call for a ground casualty risk no higher than 0.0001. To
comply with this requirement, satellites can be designed through a
design-for-demise philosophy. Still, a spacecraft designed to demise has to
survive the debris-populated space environment for many years. The demisability
and the survivability of a satellite can both be influenced by a set of common
design choices such as the material selection, the geometry definition, and the
position of the components. Within this context, two models have been developed
to analyse the demise and the survivability of satellites. Given the competing
nature of the demisability and the survivability, a multi-objective
optimisation framework was developed, with the aim to identify trade-off
solutions for the preliminary design of satellites. As the problem is nonlinear
and involves the combination of continuous and discrete variables, classical
derivative based approaches are unsuited and a genetic algorithm was selected
instead. The genetic algorithm uses the developed demisability and
survivability criteria as the fitness functions of the multi-objective
algorithm. The paper presents a test case, which considers the preliminary
optimisation of tanks in terms of material, geometry, location, and number of
tanks for a representative Earth observation mission. The configuration of the
external structure of the spacecraft is fixed. Tanks were selected because they
are sensitive to both design requirements: they represent critical components
in the demise process and impact damage can cause the loss of the mission
because of leaking and ruptures. The results present the possible trade off
solutions, constituting the Pareto front obtained from the multi-objective
optimisation.

spin-down range from $-1.8\times10^{-9}$ to $3.7\times10^{-11}$ Hz/s. No

email communication--increases, it becomes increasingly important to understand
the underlying structure that underpins these interactions. Often these
interactions form a multigraph, where we might have multiple interactions
between two entities. Such multigraphs tend to be sparse yet structured, and
their distribution often evolves over time. Existing statistical models with
interpretable parameters can capture some, but not all, of these properties. We
propose a dynamic nonparametric model for interaction multigraphs that combines
the sparsity of edge-exchangeable multigraphs with dynamic clustering patterns
that tend to reinforce recent behavioral patterns. We show that our method
yields improved held-out likelihood over stationary variants, and impressive
predictive performance against a range of state-of-the-art dynamic graph

the error correlation structure within the forecast trajectory can be utilized

boundary (CMB) has been recently revived by corroborating evidences coming from
seismic studies, mineral physics and thermal evolution models. Such a layer
could find its physical origination either in compositional stratification due
to the accumulation of light elements at the top or the core or in thermal
stratification due to the heat flux becoming locally sub-adiabatic. The exact
properties of this stably-stratified layer, namely its size $\mathcal{H}_S$ and
the degree of its stratification characterised by the Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a
frequency $N$, are however uncertain and highly debated. A stable layer
underneath the CMB can have crucial dynamical impacts on the geodynamo. Because
of the inhibition of the convective motions, a stable layer is expected to
primarily act as a low-pass filter on the magnetic field, smoothing out the
rapidly-varying and small-scale features by skin effect. To investigate this
effect more systematically, we compute 70 global geodynamo models varying the
size of the stably-stratified layer from 0 to 300~km and its amplitude from
$N/\Omega = 0$ to $N/\Omega \simeq 50$, $\Omega$ being the rotation rate. We
show that the penetration of the convective flow in the stably-stratified layer
is controlled by the typical size of the convective eddies and by the local
variations of the ratio $N/\Omega$. Using quantitative measures of the degree
of morphological semblance between the magnetic field obtained in numerical
models and the geomagnetic field at the CMB, we establish an upper bound for
the stable layer thickness $\mathcal{H}_s < (N/\Omega)^{-1} d_c$, $d_c$ being
the horizontal size of the convective flow at the base of the stable layer.
This defines a strong geomagnetic constraint on the properties of a
stably-stratified layer beneath the CMB.

only when a condition (whether a quantity of interest is above/below a

usual case where every query incurs the privacy loss. In ABC, the quantity of
interest is the distance between observed and simulated data, and only when the
distance is below a threshold, we take the corresponding prior sample as a
posterior sample. Hence, applying SVT to ABC is an organic way to transform an
ABC algorithm to a privacy-preserving variant with minimal modification, but
yields the posterior samples with a high privacy level. We theoretically
analyze the interplay between the noise added for privacy and the accuracy of

lines. However, a comprehensive analysis of all the layers put together is
often missing. In this work, we remedy this limitation by setting out a
top-to-bottom hierarchical control architecture. Decentralized voltage
controllers attached to DGUs form our primary layer. Governed by an MPC--based
Energy Management System (EMS), our tertiary layer generates optimal power
references and decision variables for DGUs. In particular, decision variables
can turn DGUs ON/OFF and select their operation modes. An intermediary
secondary layer translates EMS power references into appropriate voltage
signals required by the primary layer. More specifically, to provide a voltage
solution, the secondary layer solves an optimization problem embedding
power-flow equations shown to be always solvable. Since load voltages are not
directly enforced, their uniqueness is necessary for DGUs to produce reference
powers handed down by the EMS. To this aim, we deduce a novel uniqueness
condition based only on local load parameters. Our control framework, besides
being applicable for generic DCmG topologies, can accommodate topological
changes caused by EMS commands. Its functioning is validated via simulations on
a modified 16-bus DC system.

  Retrieval","Accepted by WACV 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image-text retrieval of natural scenes has been a popular research topic.
Since image and text are heterogeneous cross-modal data, one of the key
challenges is how to learn comprehensive yet unified representations to express
the multi-modal data. A natural scene image mainly involves two kinds of visual
concepts, objects and their relationships, which are equally essential to
image-text retrieval. Therefore, a good representation should account for both
of them. In the light of recent success of scene graph in many CV and NLP tasks
for describing complex natural scenes, we propose to represent image and text
with two kinds of scene graphs: visual scene graph (VSG) and textual scene
graph (TSG), each of which is exploited to jointly characterize objects and
relationships in the corresponding modality. The image-text retrieval task is
then naturally formulated as cross-modal scene graph matching. Specifically, we
design two particular scene graph encoders in our model for VSG and TSG, which
can refine the representation of each node on the graph by aggregating
neighborhood information. As a result, both object-level and relationship-level
cross-modal features can be obtained, which favorably enables us to evaluate
the similarity of image and text in the two levels in a more plausible way. We
achieve state-of-the-art results on Flickr30k and MSCOCO, which verifies the
advantages of our graph matching based approach for image-text retrieval.

  is the first in a series of three papers",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The majority of galaxy group catalogues available in the literature use the
popular friends-of-friends algorithm which links galaxies using a linking
length. One potential drawback to this approach is that clusters of point can
be link with thin bridges which may not be desirable. Furthermore, these
algorithms are designed with large-scales galaxy surveys in mind rather than
small-scale, local galaxy environments, where attention to detail is important.
Here we present a new simple group finder algorithm, TD-ENCLOSER, that finds
the group that encloses a target galaxy of interest. TD-ENCLOSER is based on
the kernel density estimation method which treats each galaxy, represented by a
zero-dimensional particle, as a two-dimensional circular Gaussian. The
algorithm assigns galaxies to peaks in the density field in order of density in
descending order (""Top Down"") so that galaxy groups ""grow"" around the density
peaks. Outliers in under-dense regions are prevented from joining groups by a
specified hard threshold, while outliers at the group edges are clipped below a
soft (blurred) interior density level. The group assignments are largely
insensitive to all free parameters apart from the hard density threshold and
the kernel standard deviation, although this is a known feature of
density-based group finder algorithms, and operates with a computing speed that
increases linearly with the size of the input sample. In preparation for a
companion paper, we also present a simple algorithm to select unique
representative groups when duplicates occur. TD-ENCLOSER produces results
comparable to those from a widely used catalogue, as shown in a companion
paper. A smoothing scale of 0.3 Mpc provides the most realistic group
structure.

morphology-density relation quantifies this relationship. However, optical
morphology is only loosely related to the kinematic structure of galaxies, and
about two thirds of elliptical (""spheroidal"") galaxies are actually
misclassified face-on disks, and would appear flattened if view edge on. A more
robust classification is the slow/fast rotator classification which describes
the kinematic structure. Slow and fast rotators form a bimodality in galaxy
properties and are thought to follow distinct evolutionary paths, and so a
kinematic morphology-density (kT-$\Sigma$) relation is more meaningful. To date
the kT-$\Sigma$ relation has only been studied for a handful of nearby
clusters,or across large numbers of clusters but with incomplete coverage.
Here, we combine stellar kinematics obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey's (SDSS) Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey with
classifications using a novel visual method to obtain the largest complete
census of slow and fast rotators in nearby galaxy groups and clusters. To
account for incompleteness in the SDSS spectroscopic catalogue, we combine the
catalogue with the photometric catalogue, which we clean using empirical
criteria. We test our visual classification method and find our false negative
rate to be only $\sim$6% (0% for $M \gtrsim 10^{11.7}M_{\odot}$). In contrast,
our false positive rate is about 50% implying half of all slow rotator
candidates will be confirmed as fast rotators if stellar kinematics become
available. Hence, our misclassification is essentially random with only a weak
dependence on stellar mass, and as slow rotators are intrinsically rare, the
absolute number of misclassifications will be small compared to the sample
size. The result is the largest complete census of massive slow rotator
candidates and their environments to date.

into slow and fast rotators according to a proxy of specific stellar angular

have shown that slow rotators are generally found at the centres of clusters
where the number density is highest, whereas the fast rotators trace the trend
followed by early-type galaxies of increasing in number with local density. In
this paper, we study the environmental distribution of slow and fast rotators
using the stellar kinematics of about 3900 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey's Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey. For
galaxies in groups closer than $z=0.08$ that are not observed with MaNGA but
satisfy the necessary conditions for slow rotators, we visually assign
slow/fast rotator classifications to obtain a complete sample. Our final
catalogue contains about 900 groups of five or more members. We observe the
kinematic morphology-density (kT-$\Sigma$) relation for each group and find an
increasing fraction of massive slow rotators with increasing number density. We
provide evidence suggesting that the observed lack of trends in angular
momentum with environment at fixed stellar mass is partly because the maximum
density varies between clusters, and that the locations of massive slow
rotators are strongly correlated with peak densities in galaxy groups and
clusters. We conclude that the (projected) number density relative to the
cluster peak is more fundamental than the absolute number density in
influencing the abundance of slow rotators. We find that the kT-$\Sigma$
relation does exist at fixed stellar mass, and we rule out the hypothesis that
the kT-$\Sigma$ relation is a result of dynamical friction alone, instead
arguing that massive slow rotators grow hierarchically in tandem with their
host clusters.

weak performance when the task number is small, and we cannot integrate it into
non-linear models. In this paper, we propose a two-step suboptimal unitary
method (SUM) to combine a meta-learning strategy into multi-task models. In the
first step, it searches for a global pattern by optimising the general
parameters with gradient descents under constraints, which is a geological
regularizer to enable model learning with less training data. In the second
step, we derive an optimised model on each specific task from the global
pattern with only a few local training data. Compared with traditional
multi-task learning methods, SUM shows advantages of generalisation ability on
distant tasks. It can be applied on any multi-task models with the gradient
descent as its optimiser regardless if the prediction function is linear or
not. Moreover, we can harness the model to enable traditional prediction model
to make coKriging. The experiments on public datasets have suggested that our
framework, when combined with current multi-task models, has a conspicuously
better prediction result when the task number is small compared to low-rank
tensor learning, and our model has a quite satisfying outcome when adjusting

on insulating material during a short period of time and offers the possibility
to extend the measurement method to nonconductive samples. The pulsed-bias
tests were performed first with Highly Oriented Pyrolitic Graphite (HOPG), a
conductive material, to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. By changing
the pulsed-bias frequency it was possible to obtain HOPG material with
different hydrogen surface coverages and hence different surface states leading
to an increase of negative-ion production by up to 30-50% as compared to the
continuous bias case. To establish a protocol for insulating materials, charge
accumulation on the surface during the bias pulse and influence of the bias
duration and frequency were explored using microcrystalline diamond (MCD) thin
layers. By using a pulse short enough (10 $\mu$s) at 1 kHz frequency, it has
been possible to measure negative-ions on MCD sample at a quasi-constant
surface bias of 130 V, with only 1 V variation during the measurement.
Negative-ion surface production on MCD has been studied in pulsed mode with
surface temperature from room temperature to 800{\textdegree}C. It is shown
that pulsing the bias and increasing the temperature allows limiting defect
creation on MCD which is favorable for negative-ion production. Consequently,
at 400{\textdegree}C the yield on MCD in pulsed mode is one order of magnitude
higher than the yield on HOPG in continuous mode at room temperature.

indicate that after an initial drop of as much as 40% in the first few weeks

10% over the following year. This degree of change should be quite sufficiently
small to be unimportant for all but the most demanding situations.

efforts in multi-asperity wear modeling have applied this microscopic process
to rough elastic contact. However, experimental data shows that the assumption
of purely elastic deformation at rough contact interfaces is unrealistic, and
that asperities in contact must deform plastically to accommodate the large
contact stresses. We therefore investigate the consequences of plastic
deformation on the macro-scale wear response using novel elastoplastic contact
simulations. The crack nucleation process at a rough contact interface is
analyzed in a comparative study with a classical $J_2$ plasticity approach and
a saturation plasticity model. We show that plastic residual deformations in
the $J_2$ model heighten the surface tensile stresses, leading to a higher
crack nucleation likelihood for contacts. This effect is shown to be stronger
when the material is more ductile. We also show that elastic interactions
between contacts can increase the likelihood of individual contacts nucleating
cracks, irrespective of the contact constitutive model. This is supported by a
statistical approach we develop based on a Greenwood--Williamson model modified
to take into account the elastic interactions between contacts and the shear
strength of the contact junction.

name-based analyses are semantic representations of identifiers, e.g., in the
form of learned embeddings. The high-level goal of such a representation is to
encode whether two identifiers, e.g., len and size, are semantically similar.
Unfortunately, it is currently unclear to what extent semantic representations
match the semantic relatedness and similarity perceived by developers. This
paper presents IdBench, the first benchmark for evaluating semantic
representations against a ground truth created from thousands of ratings by 500
software developers. We use IdBench to study state-of-the-art embedding
techniques proposed for natural language, an embedding technique specifically
designed for source code, and lexical string distance functions. Our results
show that the effectiveness of semantic representations varies significantly
and that the best available embeddings successfully represent semantic
relatedness. On the downside, no existing technique provides a satisfactory
representation of semantic similarities, among other reasons because
identifiers with opposing meanings are incorrectly considered to be similar,
which may lead to fatal mistakes, e.g., in a refactoring tool. Studying the
strengths and weaknesses of the different techniques shows that they complement
each other. As a first step toward exploiting this complementarity, we present
an ensemble model that combines existing techniques and that clearly
outperforms the best available semantic representation.

restore the discretization induced broken Translational Invariance (TI) in the

located on flat substrates on the density of unilateral (one-side) attachment
of hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine atoms to them. It is shown that chemically
modified graphene sheet can take four main forms on a flat substrate: the form
of a flat sheet located parallel to the surface of the substrate, the form of
convex sheet partially detached from the substrate with bent edges adjacent to
the substrate, and the forms of single and double rolls on the substrate. On
the surface of crystalline graphite, the flat form of the sheet is lowest in
energy for hydrogenation density p <0.21, fluorination density p<0.20 and
chlorination density p<0.16. The surface of crystalline nickel has higher
adsorption energy for graphene monolayer and the flat form of chemically
modified sheet on such substrate is lowest in energy for hydrogenation density
p<0.47, fluorination density p<0.30 and chlorination density p<0.21. The flat
shape of the graphene sheet remains basic on a substrate also when molecular
groups CH3, CH2-CH3 or rings C6H5 are one-side attached to its outer surface.
At the attachment density p=1/6 (one group per 6 sheet atoms) the sheet becomes
the nanocarpet the basis of which is formed by a sheet of graphene and the pile
of which is formed by the attached molecular groups forming a tightly packed
regular lattice. The addition of hydroxyl groups OH with attachment density
p=1/4 leads to the formation of hexagonal lattices of hydroxyl groups on the
outer surface of graphene sheet on a substrate. In this lattice, the groups can
form various configurations of hydrogen bonds, which turns the chemically
modified sheet into a multistable system.

the variation of spectra about $0$ along paths of selfadjoint Fredholm
operators. The aim of this work is twofold. Firstly, we consider homotopy
invariance properties of the spectral flow and establish a simple formula which
comprises its classical homotopy invariance and yields a comparison theorem for
the spectral flow under compact perturbations. We apply our result to the
existence of non-trivial solutions of boundary value problems of Hamiltonian
systems. Secondly, the spectral flow was axiomatically characterised by Lesch,
and by Ciriza, Fitzpatrick and Pejsachowicz under the assumption that the
endpoints of the paths of selfadjoint Fredholm operators are invertible. We
propose a different approach to the uniqueness of spectral flow which lifts
this additional assumption. As application of the latter result, we discuss the
relation between the spectral flow and the Maslov index in symplectic Hilbert

Decomposition theorem, which does not require analyzing the projection chain.
For $\epsilon$-orthogonal chains, this theorem may be iterated $O(1/\epsilon)$
times while only giving away a constant multiplicative factor on the overall
spectral gap. As an application, we provide a $1/n$-orthogonal decomposition of
the nearest neighbor Markov chain over $k$-class biased monotone permutations

masses together with the mass of the SM-like Higgs particle, the scenario
predicts the masses of the superpartner particles and of the extra Higgs states
of the MSSM: while the sparticles are predicted to be comparatively heavy
(above the present LHC bound but within reach of future colliders), the
spectrum has the characteristic feature that the lightest new particles are the
extra MSSM Higgses. We show that this effect is rather robust with respect to
many deformations of the GUT boundary conditions, but turns out to be sensitive
to the exactness of top-bottom Yukawa unification. Nevertheless, with moderate
deviations of a few percent from exact top-bottom Yukawa unification (stemming
e.g.\ from GUT-threshold corrections or higher-dimensional operators), the
scenario still predicts extra MSSM Higgs particles with masses not much above
$1.5\,\mathrm{TeV}$, which could be tested e.g.\ by future LHC searches for

of platooning attracted huge interests from academia and industry, especially
from logistics companies for utilizing platoons of ""long-body"" trailer trucks
because of the huge cost savings. In this paper, we demonstrate that existing
DSRC-based platooning solutions, however, fail to support formation of such
""long"" platoons consisting of typical trailer trucks because of the limited
communication range of DSRC. To address this problem, we propose L-Platooning,
the first platooning protocol that enables seamless, reliable, and rapid

that refers to a vehicle that acts like a platoon leader to extend the coverage
of the original platoon leader. A virtual leader election algorithm is
developed to effectively designate a virtual leader based on the novel metric
called the Virtual Leader Quality Index (VLQI) which quantifies the
effectiveness of a vehicle serving as a platoon leader. We also develop
mechanisms for L-Platooning to support the vehicle join and leave maneuvers
specifically for a long platoon. Through extensive simulations using the
combination of Veins (Plexe) and SUMO, we demonstrate that L-Platooning enables
long-body trailer trucks to form a long platoon effectively and maintain the

properties of the redshifted 21-cm signal $T_{\rm b}(\hat{\bf n},\nu)$ to
change with frequency $\nu$ (or cosmic time). Consequently, the statistical
homogeneity (ergodicity) of the signal along the line of sight (LoS) direction
is broken. This is a severe problem particularly during the Epoch of
Reionization (EoR) when the mean neutral hydrogen fraction ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI}$)
changes rapidly as the universe evolves. This will also pose complications for
large bandwidth observations. These effects imply that the 3D power spectrum
$P(k)$ fails to quantify the entire second-order statistics of the signal as it
assumes the signal to be ergodic and periodic along the LoS. As a proper
alternative to $P(k)$, we use the multi-frequency angular power spectrum (MAPS)
${\mathcal C}_{\ell}(\nu_1,\nu_2)$ which does not assume the signal to be
ergodic and periodic along the LoS. Here, we study the prospects for measuring
the EoR 21-cm MAPS using future observations with the upcoming SKA-Low.
Ignoring any contribution from the foregrounds, we find that the EoR 21-cm MAPS

the effects of foregrounds on MAPS detectability forecast by avoiding signal
contained within the foreground wedge in $(k_\perp, k_\parallel)$ plane. These

form of meta-learning: learning to learn on the new problem given the old.
Following the recognition that meta-learning is implementing learning in a
multi-level model, we present a Bayesian treatment for the meta-learning inner
loop through the use of deep kernels. As a result we can learn a kernel that
transfers to new tasks; we call this Deep Kernel Transfer (DKT). This approach
has many advantages: is straightforward to implement as a single optimizer,
provides uncertainty quantification, and does not require estimation of
task-specific parameters. We empirically demonstrate that DKT outperforms
several state-of-the-art algorithms in few-shot classification, and is the
state of the art for cross-domain adaptation and regression. We conclude that

theorem for the moduli spaces of stable log curves. In this paper, we introduce
a natural set up for studying the deformation theory of log (and relative)

from the Fermi energy EF to a binding energy of EB=2 eV. The minority bands of
Co2MnGa cross the Fermi level, inhibiting half-metallicity; the crossing points
allow a precise adjustment of experimental and theoretical majority and
minority bands, requiring shifts in opposite directions. The top of the
minority band lies only 0.15 eV above EF, i.e. Co2MnGa is much closer to being
half-metallic than predicted by calculations. For half-metallic Co2MnSi and
Co2Fe0.4Mn0.6Si clear minority band gaps are visible, the topmost occupied
minority bands lie 0.5 and 0.35 eV below EF, in reasonable agreement with

comparison of all three compounds uncovers the surprising fact that with
increasing number of valence electrons the frontier majority bands (close to
EF) exhibit an increasing deficiency in filling, in comparison with the
prediction of a DFT calculation. The same trend is visible in comparison with a
DMFT calculation. For s-polarized excitation both half-metallic compounds

dissipation due to Joule heating is highly suppressed - is an active area of
research that could lead to energy-efficient spintronics applications. However,
magnon spin currents supported by conventional systems with uniform magnetic
order have proven hard to control. An alternative approach that relies on
topologically protected magnonic edge states of spatially periodic magnetic
textures has recently emerged. A prime example of such textures is the
ferromagnetic skyrmion crystal which hosts chiral edge states providing a
platform for magnon spin currents. Here, we show, for the first time, an
external magnetic field can drive a topological phase transition in the spin
wave spectrum of a ferromagnetic skyrmion crystal. The topological phase
transition is signaled by the closing of a low-energy bulk magnon gap at a
critical field. In the topological phase, below the critical field, two
topologically protected chiral magnonic edge states lie within this gap, but
they unravel in the trivial phase, above the critical field. Remarkably, the
topological phase transition involves an inversion of two magnon bands that at
the $\Gamma$ point correspond to the breathing and anticlockwise modes of the
skyrmions in the crystal. Our findings suggest that an external magnetic field
could be used as a knob to switch on and off magnon spin currents carried by
topologically protected chiral magnonic edge states.

Here, we report our theoretical predictions on photocarrier dynamics in an
ultimately thin (about 1 nm) CdTe slab. It corresponds to a layer that is just
a single unit cell thick, when the bulk parent crystal in the zinc blende phase
is cleaved along the [110] facet. Using an \textit{ab-initio} method based on
density functional theory (DFT) and the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation
time approximation (RTA), we determine the thermalization time for charge
carriers excited to a certain energy for instance through laser irradiation.
Our calculations include contributions arising from all phonon branches in the
first Brillouin zone (BZ), thus capturing all relevant inter- and intraband
carrier transitions due to electron-phonon scattering. We find that the
photocarrier thermalization time is strongly reduced, by one order of magnitude
for holes and by three orders of magnitude for electrons, once the CdTe crystal
is thinned down from the bulk to a monolayer. Most surprisingly, the electron
thermalization time becomes independent of the electron excess energy up to
about 0.5~eV, when counted from the conduction band minimum (CBM). We relate
this peculiar behavior to the degenerate and nearly parabolic lowest conduction
band that yields a constant density of states (DOS) in the 2D limit. Our
findings may be useful for designing novel CdTe-based optoelectronic devices,

Microcalorimeter and bolometer arrays based on transition edge sensor with

pratical multiplexing techniques in order to simplify the cryogenics and

changes in the TES input current is tranduced to a change in phase of a

determine a new set of calibration coefficients for the ultraviolet,

improved agreement between the integrated cosmic star formation history and the
in-situ measured stellar mass density as a function of redshift. However, these

protocols that employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques, referred to
as carrier-sense deep-reinforcement learning multiple access (CS-DLMA). The
goal of CS-DLMA is to enable efficient and equitable spectrum sharing among a
group of co-located heterogeneous wireless networks. Existing CSMA protocols,
such as the medium access control (MAC) of WiFi, are designed for a homogeneous
network in which all nodes adopt the same protocol. Such protocols suffer from
severe performance degradation in a heterogeneous environment where there are
nodes adopting other MAC protocols. CS-DLMA aims to circumvent this problem by
making use of DRL. In particular, this paper adopts alpha-fairness as the
general objective of CS-DLMA. With alpha-fairness, CS-DLMA can achieve a range
of different objectives when coexisting with other MACs by changing the value
of alpha. A salient feature of CS-DLMA is that it can achieve these objectives
without knowing the coexisting MACs through a learning process based on DRL.
The underpinning DRL technique in CS-DLMA is deep Q-network (DQN). However, the
conventional DQN algorithms are not suitable for CS-DLMA due to their uniform
time-step assumption. In CSMA protocols, time steps are non-uniform in that the
time duration required for carrier sensing is smaller than the duration of data
transmission. This paper introduces a non-uniform time-step formulation of DQN
to address this issue. Our simulation results show that CS-DLMA can achieve the
general alpha-fairness objective when coexisting with TDMA, ALOHA, and WiFi
protocols by adjusting its own transmission strategy. Interestingly, we also
find that CS-DLMA is more Pareto efficient than other CSMA protocols when
coexisting with WiFi.

the bosonic fractional Chern insulator state at filling $\nu = 1/2$, in the
specific case of the Harper-Hofstadter Hamiltonian with hard-core interactions.
For this purpose we employ a Tree Tensor Network technique, which allows us to
study systems with up to $N=18$ particles on a $16 \times 16$ lattice and
experiencing an additional harmonic confinement. First, we observe the
quantization of the quasihole charge at fractional values and its robustness
against the shape and strength of the impurity potentials used to create and
localize such excitations. Then, we numerically characterize quasihole anyonic
statistics by applying a discretized version of the relation connecting the
statistics of quasiholes in the lowest Landau level to the depletions they
create in the density profile [Macaluso et al., arXiv:1903.03011]. Our results
give a direct proof of the anyonic statistics for quasiholes of fractional
Chern insulators, starting from a realistic Hamiltonian. Moreover, they provide
strong indications that this property can be experimentally probed through
local density measurements, making our scheme readily applicable in
state-of-the-art experiments with ultracold atoms and superconducting qubits.

biosignature gases. Beyond the most discussed biosignature gas O$_2$, only a
handful of gases have been considered in detail. Here we evaluate phosphine
(PH$_3$). On Earth, PH$_3$ is associated with anaerobic ecosystems, and as such
is a potential biosignature gas on anoxic exoplanets.
  We simulate CO$_2-$ and H$_2-$dominated habitable terrestrial planet
atmospheres. We find that PH$_3$ can accumulate to detectable concentrations on
planets with surface production fluxes of 10$^{10}$-10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ (corresponding to surface concentrations of 10s of ppb to 100s of
ppm), depending on atmospheric composition and UV flux. While high, such
surface fluxes are comparable to the global terrestrial production rate of
CH$_4$ (10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) and below the maximum local terrestrial
PH$_3$ production rate (10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$). As with other gases,
PH$_3$ can more readily accumulate on low-UV planets, e.g. planets orbiting
quiet M-dwarfs or with a photochemical UV shield.
  If detected, PH$_3$ is a promising biosignature gas, as it has no known
abiotic false positives on terrestrial planets that could generate the high
fluxes required for detection. PH$_3$ also has 3 strong spectral features such
that in any atmosphere scenario 1 of the 3 will be unique compared to other
dominant spectroscopic molecules. PH$_3$'s weakness as a biosignature gas is
its high reactivity, requiring high outgassing for detectability. We calculate
that 10s of hours of JWST time are required for a potential detection of
PH$_3$. Yet because PH$_3$ is spectrally active in the same wavelength regions
as other atmospherically important molecules (e.g., H$_2$O and CH$_4$),
searches for PH$_3$ can be carried out at no additional observational cost to
searches for other molecules relevant to exoplanet habitability.

particle identification, which make the experiment an ideal place to look for
light long-lived particles (LLP) decaying into Standard Model (SM) hadrons. In
contrast with the typical search strategy relying on energetic jets and a high
multiplicity of tracks from the LLP decay, LHCb can identify LLPs in exclusive,
specific hadronic final states. To illustrate the idea, we study the
sensitivity of LHCb to an exotic Higgs decay $h\to SS$, followed by the
displaced decay of GeV-scale scalars into charged kaons $S\to K^+K^-$. We show
that the reconstruction of kaon vertices in narrow invariant mass windows can
efficiently eliminate the combinatorial backgrounds from $B$-meson decays.
While the same signal is extremely difficult to probe in the existing displaced
jet searches at ATLAS/CMS, the LHCb search we propose can probe the branching
ratio BR$(h\to SS)$ down to $0.1\%$ ($0.02\%$) level with $15$ ($300$)
fb$^{-1}$ of data. We also apply this projected bound to two scenarios with
Higgs portal couplings, where the scalar mediator $S$ either couples to a) the
SM quarks only, or b) to both quarks and leptons in the minimal flavor
violation paradigm. In both scenarios we compare the reach of our proposed
search with the expected constraints from ATLAS and CMS on the invisible Higgs
width and with the constraints from rare B-decays studies at LHCb. We find that
for 1 GeV $< m_S < $ 2 GeV and $0.5~{\rm mm} \lesssim c \tau \lesssim 10$ mm
our proposed search will be competitive with the ATLAS and CMS projections,
while at the same time providing crucial information of the hadronic
interactions of $S$, which can not be obtained from the {\it indirect}

We argue that these modes can be described as quantum harmonic oscillators with

corresponding growth rate $\gamma_{\rm TI}$ is derived within the modified
Hasegawa--Wakatani model. We show that $\gamma_{\rm TI}$ equals the

hence, the instability threshold is shifted compared to that in homogeneous
turbulence. This provides a generic explanation of the well-known yet elusive
Dimits shift, which we find explicitly in the Terry--Horton limit. Linearly
unstable tertiary modes either saturate due to the evolution of the zonal

sufficiently weakened by viscosity. The Dimits regime ends when such structures

sample, with roughly 700 high-quality, likely but unconfirmed SNIa
light-curves, to develop new analysis tools aimed at evaluating systematic
uncertainties on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w$. Since we
require a spectroscopically measured host galaxy redshift for each SN, we
determine the associated selection efficiency of host galaxies in order to
simulate bias corrections. We determine that the mis-association rate of host
galaxies is $0.6\%$; ignoring this effect in simulated bias corrections leads
to a $w$-bias of $\Delta w = +0.0007$, where $w$ is evaluated from SNIa and
priors from measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations and the cosmic
microwave background. We assess the uncertainty in our modeling of the host
galaxy selection efficiency and find the associated $w$ uncertainty to be
$-0.0072$. Finally, we explore new core collapse (CC) models in simulated
training samples and find that adjusting the CC luminosity distribution to be
in agreement with previous Pan-STARRS analyses yields a better match to the
SDSS data. The impact of ignoring this adjustment is $\Delta w = -0.0109$; the
impact of replacing the new CC models with those used by Pan-STARRS is $\Delta

early Universe, particularly inflation. In light of this, we study the
formation of PBHs by the collapse of overdense perturbations generated during a
model of warm inflation. For our model, we find that the primordial curvature
power spectrum is red-tilted (spectral index $n_s<1$) at the large scale (small
$k$) and is consistent with the $n_s-r$ values allowed from the CMB
observations. Along with that, it has a blue-tilt ($n_s>1$) for the small PBH
scales (large $k$), with a sufficiently large amplitude of the primordial
curvature power spectrum required to form PBHs. These features originate
because of the inflaton's coupling with the other fields during warm inflation.
We discuss the role of the inflaton dissipation to the enhancement in the
primordial power spectrum at the PBH scales. We find that for some parameter
range of our warm inflation model, PBHs with mass $\sim 10^3$ g can be formed
with significant abundance. Such tiny mass PBHs have a short lifetime $\sim
10^{-19}$ s and would have evaporated into Hawking radiation in the early
Universe. Further in this study, we discuss the evaporation constraints on the
initial mass fraction of the generated PBHs and the possibility of Planck mass
PBH relics to constitute the dark matter.

$3$-polytopes, there exists an inscribable polytope with that $f$-vector. For
higher-dimensional polytopes, much less is known. Of course, for any
inscribable polytope, all of its lower-dimensional faces need to be
inscribable, but this condition does not appear to be very strong.
  We observe non-trivial new obstructions to the inscribability of polytopes
that arise when imposing that a certain inscribable face be inscribed. Using
this obstruction, we show that the duals of the $4$-dimensional cyclic
polytopes with at least $8$ vertices---all of whose faces are inscribable---are
not inscribable. This result is optimal in the following sense: We prove that
the duals of the cyclic $4$-polytopes with up to $7$ vertices are, in fact,
inscribable.
  Moreover, we interpret this obstruction combinatorially as a forbidden
subposet of the face lattice of a polytope, show that $d$-dimensional cyclic
polytopes with at least $d+4$ vertices are not circumscribable, and that no
dual of a neighborly $4$-polytope with $8$ vertices, that is, no polytope with
$f$-vector $(20,40,28,8)$, is inscribable.

The web crawler is used to download large sets of online food images based on
the given food labels. Since not all retrieved images contain foods, we
introduce an automatic food detection method to remove irrelevant images. We
designed a web-based crowdsourcing tool to assist the crowd or human annotators

objective functions combining these two features are compared, referred to as
joint and coupled, promoting either independent or co-localized changes in
local variance and regularity. To solve the resulting convex nonsmooth
optimization problems, because the processing of large size images and
databases are targeted, two categories of proximal algorithms (dual
forward-backward and primal-dual), are devised and compared. An in-depth study
of the objective functions, notably of their strong convexity, memory and

class of synthetic models of piecewise fractal texture is constructed and
studied. They enable, by means of large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations, to
quantify the benefits in texture segmentation of combining local regularity and
local variance (as opposed to regularity only) while using strong-convexity
accelerated primal-dual algorithms. Achieved results also permit to discuss the

reconstruction method mainly focuses on improving image quality by
incorporating regularization priors. Very recently, the regularization priors

image reconstruction and post image-domain material decomposition, the
performance of regularization by combining these two cases is still an open
problem. To realize this goal, the material accuracy from those steps are first
analyzed and compared. Then, to further improve the accuracy of decomposition

Lyapunov equation related to linear SPDEs (stochastic partial differential
equations) driven by multiplicative noise is considered. The discretization of
the Lyapunov equation in space is given by finite elements and in time by a
semiimplicit Euler scheme. The main result is the derivation of the rate of
convergence in operator norm. Moreover, it is shown that the solution of the
equation provides a representation of a quadratic and path dependent functional
of the SPDE solution. This fact yields a deterministic numerical method to
compute such functionals. As a secondary result, weak error rates are
established for a fully discrete finite element approximation of the SPDE with
respect to this functional. This is obtained as a consequence of the
approximation analysis of the Lyapunov equation. It is the first weak
convergence analysis for fully discrete finite element approximations of SPDEs
driven by multiplicative noise that obtains double the strong rate of
convergence, especially for path dependent functionals and smooth spatial
noise. Numerical experiments illustrate the results empirically and it is
demonstrated that the deterministic method has advantages over Monte Carlo
sampling in a stability context.

deployed in a wide array of applications, from providing control mechanisms to
devices lacking traditional interfaces, to the automatic transcription of
conversations and authentication of users. Many of these applications have
significant security and privacy considerations. We develop attacks that force
mistranscription and misidentification in state of the art systems, with
minimal impact on human comprehension. Processing pipelines for modern systems
are comprised of signal preprocessing and feature extraction steps, whose
output is fed to a machine-learned model. Prior work has focused on the models,
using white-box knowledge to tailor model-specific attacks. We focus on the
pipeline stages before the models, which (unlike the models) are quite similar
across systems. As such, our attacks are black-box and transferable, and
demonstrably achieve mistranscription and misidentification rates as high as
100% by modifying only a few frames of audio. We perform a study via Amazon
Mechanical Turk demonstrating that there is no statistically significant
difference between human perception of regular and perturbed audio. Our
findings suggest that models may learn aspects of speech that are generally not
perceived by human subjects, but that are crucial for model accuracy. We also
find that certain English language phonemes (in particular, vowels) are
significantly more susceptible to our attack. We show that the attacks are
effective when mounted over cellular networks, where signals are subject to
degradation due to transcoding, jitter, and packet loss.

i.e. a lack of adaptability to particular organisational contexts - domain,
technical infrastructure, stakeholders, business process, etc. Adapting metrics
to an organisational context is essential (1) for the metrics to align with
business requirements (2) for decision makers to maintain relevant security
goals based on measurements from the field. In this paper we propose SYMBIOSIS,
a methodology that defines a goal elicitation and refinement process mapping
business objectives to security measurement goals via the use of systematic
templates that capture relevant context elements (business goals, purpose,
stakeholders, system scope). The novel contribution of SYMBIOSIS is the
well-defined process, which enforces that (1) metrics align with business
objectives via a top-down derivation that refines top-level business objectives
to a manageable granularity (2) the impact of metrics on business objectives is
explicitly traced via a bottom-up feedback mechanism, allowing an incremental
approach where feedback from metrics influences business goals, and vice-versa.
In this paper, we discuss the findings from applying SYMBIOSIS to three case
studies of known security incidents. Our analysis shows how the aforementioned
pitfalls of security metrics development processes affected the outcome of
these high-profile security incidents and how SYMBIOSIS addresses such issues.

during the stages of software development. This review aims to present a

comprehensive literature review was conducted based on 107 relevant studies

specific activities at the technical and non-technical levels. The technical
level consists of software design, coding, and user experience attributes. The
non-technical level consists of documentation, sustainability manifestos,
training of software engineers, funding software projects, and leadership
skills of project managers to achieve sustainability. This paper groups the

of their predictions and separating them into the epistemic and aleatoric
fractions is still considered challenging. In oil and gas exploration projects,
tools consisting of seismic, sonic, magnetic resonance, resistivity, dielectric
and/or nuclear sensors are sent downhole through boreholes to probe the earth's
rock and fluid properties. The measurements from these tools are used to build
reservoir models that are subsequently used for estimation and optimization of
hydrocarbon production. Machine learning algorithms are often used to estimate
the rock and fluid properties from the measured downhole data. Quantifying
uncertainties of these properties is crucial for rock and fluid evaluation and
subsequent reservoir optimization and production decisions. These machine
learning algorithms are often trained on a ""ground-truth"" or core database.
During the inference phase which involves application of these algorithms to
field data, it is critical that the machine learning algorithm flag data as out
of distribution from new geologies that the model was not trained upon. It is
also highly important to be sensitive to heteroscedastic aleatoric noise in the
feature space arising from the combination of tool and geological conditions.
Understanding the source of the uncertainty and reducing them is key to
designing intelligent tools and applications such as automated log
interpretation answer products for exploration and field development. In this

comprising of the combination of a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) and an

the gradient vanishing and exploding problems and thus difficult to learn
long-term patterns and construct deep networks. To address these problems, this
paper proposes a new type of RNNs with the recurrent connection formulated as
Hadamard product, referred to as independently recurrent neural network
(IndRNN), where neurons in the same layer are independent of each other and
connected across layers. Due to the better behaved gradient backpropagation,
IndRNN with regulated recurrent weights effectively addresses the gradient
vanishing and exploding problems and thus long-term dependencies can be
learned. Moreover, an IndRNN can work with non-saturated activation functions
such as ReLU (rectified linear unit) and be still trained robustly. Different
deeper IndRNN architectures, including the basic stacked IndRNN, residual
IndRNN and densely connected IndRNN, have been investigated, all of which can
be much deeper than the existing RNNs. Furthermore, IndRNN reduces the
computation at each time step and can be over 10 times faster than the commonly
used Long short-term memory (LSTM). Experimental results have shown that the
proposed IndRNN is able to process very long sequences and construct very deep
networks. Better performance has been achieved on various tasks with IndRNNs
compared with the traditional RNN, LSTM and the popular Transformer.

behaviour of spacecraft components during the atmospheric re-entry and a
survivability model to assess the vulnerability of spacecraft structures
against space debris impacts. Two indices that evaluate the level of
demisability and survivability are also proposed. The two models are then used
to study the sensitivity of the demisability and of the survivability indices
as a function of typical design-for-demise options. The demisability and the
survivability can in fact be influenced by the same design parameters in a
competing fashion that is while the demisability is improved, the survivability
is worsened and vice versa. The analysis shows how the design-for-demise
solutions influence the demisability and the survivability independently. In
addition, the effect that a solution has simultaneously on the two criteria is
assessed. Results shows which, among the design-for-demise parameters mostly
influence the demisability and the survivability. For such design parameters
maps are presented, describing their influence on the demisability and
survivability indices. These maps represent a useful tool to quickly assess the
level of demisability and survivability that can be expected from a component,

consumption of a machine during its idle periods. In the scheduling domain, it
is common to model the behaviour of the machine by defining a small set of
machine modes, e.g. ""on"", ""off"" and ""stand-by"". Then the transitions between
the modes are represented by a static transition graph. In this paper, we argue
that this type of model might be too restrictive for some types of machines
(e.g. the furnaces). For such machines, we propose to employ the complete
time-domain dynamics and integrate it into an idle energy function. This way,
the scheduling algorithm can exploit the full knowledge about the machine
dynamics with minimised energy consumption encapsulated in this function. In
this paper, we study a scheduling problem, where the tasks characterised by
release times and deadlines are scheduled in the given order such that the idle
energy consumption of the machine is minimised. We show that this problem can
be solved in polynomial time whenever the idle energy function is concave. To
highlight the practical applicability, we analyse a heat-intensive system
employing a steel-hardening furnace. We derive an energy optimal control law,
and the corresponding idle energy function, for the bilinear system model
approximating the dynamics of the furnace (and possibly other heat-intensive
systems). Further, we prove that the idle energy function is, indeed, concave
in this case. Therefore, the proposed scheduling algorithm can be used.
Numerical experiments show that by using our approach, combining both the
optimal control and optimal scheduling, higher energy savings can be achieved,
compared to the state-of-the-art scheduling approaches.

applications the modelling still remains empirical based on some form of
expertise and physical constraints enforcement in the absence of historical
observations or predictions. We have developed two novel robust adaptive
assimilation methods named CUTE (Covariance Updating iTerativE) and PUB
(Partially Updating BLUE). These two non-parametric methods are based on
different optimization objectives, both capable of sequentially adapting
background error covariance matrices in order to improve assimilation results

  radiation",,"OSA Continuum, Vol. 3, No. 2 2020 186",,"https://doi.org/10.1364/OSAC.381477","physics.app-ph physics.optics physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we present a hypothesis that spectral response of atoms or
molecules to a pulse of electromagnetic radiation with fast rising or falling
fronts would contain a unique emission line that is located approximately near
the frequency of the natural oscillations of optical electron. The emission of
this ""pinging"" spectral line would exist during the time that is determined by
the time of radiative energy loss by the optical electron. The amplitude of the
""pinging"" spectral line would be higher for the pulses with faster raising or
falling fronts. The simulations using our previously developed model confirmed
existence of the ""pinging"" spectral response. If experimentally confirmed, this
work could lead to a new high sensitivity and high signal to noise ratio
stand-off detection techniques, a new type of LIDAR, and to other yet unknown
applications.
