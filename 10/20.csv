discovery of $J/\psi$ meson. Since more than 40 years the charmonium production
mechanism is still not entirely understood. Following the era of investigations
at $e^+e^-$ machines, nowadays, charmonium states are copiously produced at
hadron colliders, that allows systematic studies of their resonance parameters,
production observables and decays. Despite large production rates, many
charmonium states are barely studied due to the complications of their
reconstruction against a large background level. The LHCb experiment provides a
unique opportunity to study S-wave and P-wave charmonium states using their
decays to hadrons. This allows measuring production observables of $\eta_c$ and
$\chi_c$ charmonium states. According to the theoretical formalism of
Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD), the production observables of the same wave
charmonium states are linked. Hence, the LHCb measurements provide a series of
stringent tests of NRQCD. In the framework of this thesis, the first
measurement of the $\eta_c(1S)$ differential production cross-section at
$\sqrt{s}=13\,TeV$ and the most precise to date single mass measurement are
performed, where the $\eta_c(1S)$ state is reconstructed via its decay to
$p\bar{p}$. In addition, the production of the $\chi_c$ and $\eta_c(2S)$ states
in $b$-hadron decays is studied using decays to $\phi\phi$. The obtained
results are confronted with existing theory predictions. The original
phenomenological analysis concludes that the description of charmonium prompt
production and production in inclusive $b$-hadron decays in an entire range of
transverse momentum remains a challenge.

the last decade or so. The syntactic, algebraic approach to the subject is
popularly known as ""flag algebras"", while the semantic, geometric one is often
associated with the name ``graph limits''. The language of graph limits is
generally more intuitive and expressible, but a price that one has to pay for
it is that it is better suited for the case of ordinary graphs than for more
general combinatorial objects. Accordingly, there have been several attempts in
the literature, of varying degree of generality, to define limit objects for
more complicated combinatorial structures.
  This paper is another attempt at a workable general theory of dense limit
objects. Unlike previous efforts in this direction (with notable exception of
[Ashwini Aroskar and James Cummings. Limits, regularity and removal for finite
structures. Technical Report arXiv:1412.2014 [math.LO], arXiv e-print, 2014.]),
we base our account on the same concepts from the first-order logic and the
model theory as in the theory of flag algebras.
  We show how our definition naturally encompasses a host of previously
considered cases (graphons, hypergraphons, digraphons, permutons, posetons,
colored graphs, etc.), and we extend the fundamental properties of existence
and uniqueness to this more general case. We also give an intuitive general
proof of the continuous version of the Induced Removal Lemma based on the
completeness theorem for propositional calculus. We capitalize on the notion of
an open interpretation that often allows to transfer methods and results from
one situation to another. Again, we show that some previous arguments can be
quite naturally framed using this language.

irregularly spaced signals with a complicated structure, e.g. a sum of
different components, different methods may produce significantly different

  The basic approach is based on classical method of the least squares
(1994OAP.....7...49A). However, contrary to common ""step-by-step"" methods of
removal important components (e.g. mean, trend (""detrending""), sine wave

pulsating variable RY UMa. The star shows a drastic cyclic change of
semi-amplitude of pulsations between 0.01 to 0.37mag, which is interpreted as a
bias between the waves with close periods and a beat period of 4000d (11yr).
The dominating period has changed from 307.35(8)d before 1993 to 285.26(6)d
after 1993. The initial epoch of the maximum brightness for the recent interval

account for the localized nature of indoor lighting. Instead, we represent
lighting as a set of discrete 3D lights with geometric and photometric
parameters. We train a deep neural network to regress these parameters from a
single image, on a dataset of environment maps annotated with depth. We propose
a differentiable layer to convert these parameters to an environment map to
compute our loss; this bypasses the challenge of establishing correspondences
between estimated and ground truth lights. We demonstrate, via quantitative and
qualitative evaluations, that our representation and training scheme lead to
more accurate results compared to previous work, while allowing for more
realistic 3D object compositing with spatially-varying lighting.

quickly for youth of high socioeconomic status (SES) compared to youth of low

coordination of access and transportation to in-person treatment sessions.
Low-SES youth may have family obligations that limit their ability to access
in-person treatment. At the same time, mobile use among adolescents is high:
85% have smartphones. Additionally, adolescents engage in texting at high
rates, suggesting that they are well-suited for mobile instant messaging
interventions. Mobile interventions have shown promise for youth, but their use

the vacuum energy is interacting with cold dark matter throughout the cosmic

model baseline by including the properties of neutrinos, such as the neutrino
mass scale ($M_{\nu}$) and the effective number of neutrino species ($N_{\rm
eff}$) as free parameters, in order to verify the possible effects that such
parameters might generate on the coupling parameter, and vice versa. As already
known, we again confirm that in light of the Planck 2018 data, such dark
coupling can successfully solve the $H_0$ tension (with and without the
presence of neutrinos). Concerning the properties of neutrinos, we find that
$M_{\nu}$ may be wider than expected within the $\Lambda$CDM model and $N_{\rm
eff}$ is fully compatible with three neutrino species (similar to $\Lambda$CDM
prevision). The parameters characterizing the properties of neutrinos do not
correlate with the coupling parameter of the interaction model. When
considering the joint analysis of CMB from Planck 2018 and an estimate of $H_0$
from Hubble Space Telescope 2019 data, {\it we find an evidence for a non-null
value of the coupling parameter at more than 3$\sigma$ confidence-level.} We
also discuss the possible effects on the interacting scenario due to the
inclusion of baryon acoustic oscillations data with Planck 2018. Our main
results updating the dark sectors' interaction and neutrino properties in the
model baseline, represent a new perspective in this direction. Clearly, a
possible new physics in light of some dark interaction between dark energy and

considering an inner optimisation step within the loss. This way, we do not aim
at identifying the parts of an image that contribute to the model's output but
rather the locations that are responsible for the good training of the model on
this image. Conversely, we also show that a similar meta-learning approach can
be used to extract the adversarial locations which can lead to the degradation

peaks in a field constructed by voronoi tessellation of the particles in a
cosmological N-body simulation. The TLT uniquely partitions the simulation
particles into disjoint subsets, each associated with a local density peak.
Each peak is a subpeak of a unique higher peak. The TLT can be persistence
filtered to suppress peaks produced by discreteness noise. Thresholding a
peak's particle list at $\sim 80\left<\rho\right>$ results in a structure
similar to a standard friend-of-friends halo and its subhaloes. For thresholds
below $\sim 7\left<\rho\right>$, the largest structure percolates and is much
more massive than other objects. It may be considered as defining the cosmic
web. For a threshold of $5\left<\rho\right>$, it contains about half of all
cosmic mass and occupies $\sim 1\%$ of all cosmic volume; a typical external
point is then $\sim 7h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ from the web. We investigate the
internal structure and clustering of TLT peaks. Defining the saddle point
density $\rho_{\mathrm{lim}}$ as the density at which a peak joins its parent
peak, we show the median value of $\rho_{\mathrm{lim}}$ for FoF-like peaks to
be similar to the density threshold at percolation. Assembly bias as a function
of $\rho_{\mathrm{lim}}$ is stronger than for any known internal halo property.
For peaks of group mass and below, the lowest quintile in $\rho_{\mathrm{lim}}$
has $b\approx 0$, and is thus uncorrelated with the mass distribution.

was conjectured by Geck in 1990 as part of his PhD thesis. We establish this
result by constructing projective modules using a modification of generalised
Gelfand--Graev characters introduced by Kawanaka. We prove that each such
character has at most one unipotent constituent which occurs with multiplicity
one. This establishes a 30 year old conjecture of Kawanaka.

additional light scalar field, any coupling between matter and this scalar can
affect the orbital motion of binary systems. Ordinarily, the new force mediated
by the scalar can be naturally the same order of magnitude as the usual
gravitational force and therefore is tightly constrained. We show that a
disformal coupling between the scalar and matter can lead to a novel screening
mechanism in which these fifth forces are suppressed by several orders of
magnitude at sufficiently small separations and large relative velocities (such
as solar system scales). This is a result of resumming a class of ladder
diagrams, which suppresses the propagation of scalar signals between the two
bodies. Moreover, we are able to relate potential ambiguities in this
resummation to non-perturbative effects (which are invisible to perturbation
theory). As a result, solar system tests and future gravitational wave
observations can now be used to place meaningful constraints on scalar-tensor
theories with disformal couplings. We exemplify this using observational bounds
on the precession of planetary orbits.

the claim that inflation models with an inflationary energy scale larger than
Lambda_inf^max ~ 10^9 GeV belong to the swampland, i.e., cannot be embedded
into a consistent theory of quantum gravity. In this paper, we point out that
this constraint can be readily satisfied in D-term hybrid inflation (DHI),
which is a well-motivated inflation scenario in the context of supersymmetric
grand unification. In DHI, the amplitude of the primordial scalar power
spectrum originates from a Fayet-Iliopoulos term of the order of the

an upper bound on the corresponding gauge coupling constant of g_max ~ 10^-14.
We are able to show that this constraint translates into an upper bound on the
gravitino mass of m_3/2^max ~ 10 MeV, which opens the possibility that dark
matter is accounted for by thermally produced gravitinos, if the reheating
temperature is close to T_reh ~ 100 TeV. Interestingly enough, a somewhat
similar gravitino mass range has recently been derived in a model that aims at
explaining dark energy in terms of axion quintessence and resolving the Hubble
tension by means of decaying gravitino dark matter.

  Estimation Approach","Article accepted in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and

approach for estimating the time difference of arrival (TDOA) between the
signals received at two sensors. Time delay estimates are obtained by
maximizing the GCC output, where the direct-path delay is usually observed as a
prominent peak. Moreover, GCCs play also an important role in steered response
power (SRP) localization algorithms, where the SRP functional can be written as
an accumulation of the GCCs computed from multiple sensor pairs. Unfortunately,
the accuracy of TDOA estimates is affected by multiple factors, including
noise, reverberation and signal bandwidth. In this paper, a sub-band approach
for time delay estimation aimed at improving the performance of the
conventional GCC is presented. The proposed method is based on the extraction
of multiple GCCs corresponding to different frequency bands of the cross-power
spectrum phase in a sliding-window fashion. The major contributions of this
paper include: 1) a sub-band GCC representation of the cross-power spectrum
phase that, despite having a reduced temporal resolution, provides a more
suitable representation for estimating the true TDOA; 2) such matrix
representation is shown to be rank one in the ideal noiseless case, a property
that is exploited in more adverse scenarios to obtain a more robust and
accurate GCC; 3) we propose a set of low-rank approximation alternatives for
processing the sub-band GCC matrix, leading to better TDOA estimates and source
localization performance. An extensive set of experiments is presented to
demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.

attention in the deep learning research, the width of these networks has
recently received greater interest. The width of networks, defined as the size
of the receptive fields and the density of the channels, has demonstrated
crucial importance in low-level vision tasks such as image denoising and
restoration. However, the limited generalization ability, due to the increased
width of networks, creates a bottleneck in designing wider networks. In this
paper, we propose the Deep Regulated Convolutional Network (RC-Net), a deep
network composed of regulated sub-network blocks cascaded by skip-connections,
to overcome this bottleneck. Specifically, the Regulated Convolution block
(RC-block), featured by a combination of large and small convolution filters,
balances the effectiveness of prominent feature extraction and the
generalization ability of the network. RC-Nets have several compelling
advantages: they embrace diversified features through large-small filter
combinations, alleviate the hazy boundary and blurred details in image
denoising and super-resolution problems, and stabilize the learning process.
Our proposed RC-Nets outperform state-of-the-art approaches with significant
performance gains in various image restoration tasks while demonstrating
promising generalization ability. The code is available at

in the past ten years, with international organizations, societies,
conferences, workshops, and summer schools becoming the norm. Canada's formal
role in astrostatistics and astroinformatics has been relatively limited, but
there is a great opportunity and necessity for growth in this area. We
conducted a survey of astronomers in Canada to gain information on the training
mechanisms through which we learn statistical methods and to identify areas for
improvement. In general, the results of our survey indicate that while
astronomers see statistical methods as critically important for their research,
they lack focused training in this area and wish they had received more formal
training during all stages of education and professional development. These
findings inform our recommendations for the LRP2020 on how to increase
interdisciplinary connections between astronomy and statistics at the

predicting whether an individual might benefit from an intervention. The

estimation of treatment effect conditioned on unique sets of the covariate
vector; (2) identification of features important for heterogeneity using an
ensemble of non-parametric variable importance methods; and (3) estimation of
treatment effect on the reference classes defined by the previously selected
features, using one-step Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation. We conducted a
series of simulation studies and found that this method performs well when
either sample size or event rate is high enough and the number of covariates
contributing to the effect heterogeneity is moderate. An application of this

argue that CNNs are ""diagnosing"" voxels (or pixels), rather than lesions; in
other words, visual saliency from a trained CNN is not necessarily concentrated
on the lesions. On the other hand, classification in clinical applications
suffers from inherent ambiguities: radiologists may produce diverse diagnosis
on challenging cases. To this end, we propose a controllable and explainable
{\em Probabilistic Radiomics} framework, by combining the Radiomics analysis

upon lesion region only, then encoded into lesion representation, by a
controllable Non-local Shape Analysis Module (NSAM) based on self-attention.
Inspired from variational auto-encoders (VAEs), an Ambiguity PriorNet is used
to approximate the ambiguity distribution over human experts. The final

unbounded domain with bounded scatterers. This technique is based on a complex
compression coordinate transformation in polar coordinates, and a judicious
substitution of the unknown field in the artificial layer. Compared with the
widely-used perfectly matched layer (PML) methods, the distinctive features of
PAL lie in that (i) it is truly exact in the sense that the PAL-solution is
identical to the original solution in the bounded domain reduced by the
truncation layer; (ii) with the substitution, the PAL-equation is free of
singular coefficients and the substituted unknown field is essentially
non-oscillatory in the layer; and (iii) the construction is valid for general
star-shaped domain truncation. By formulating the variational formulation in
Cartesian coordinates, the implementation of this technique using standard
spectral-element or finite-element methods can be made easy as a usual coding
practice. We provide ample numerical examples to demonstrate that this method
is highly accurate, parameter-free and robust for very high wave-number and
thin layer. It outperforms the classical PML and the recently advocated PML
using unbounded absorbing functions. Moreover, it can fix some flaws of the PML
approach.

fold oscillations during phonation. The parameters of these models, such as
vocal fold elasticity, resistance, etc. are traditionally determined through
the observation and measurement of the vocal fold vibrations in the larynx.
Since such direct measurements tend to be the most accurate, the traditional
practice has been to set the parameter values of these models based on
measurements that are averaged across an ensemble of human subjects. However,
the direct measurement process is hard to revise outside of clinical settings.
In many cases, especially in pathological ones, the properties of the vocal
folds often deviate from their generic values---sometimes asymmetrically
wherein the characteristics of the two vocal folds differ for the same
individual. In such cases, it is desirable to find a more scalable way to
adjust the model parameters on a case by case basis. In this paper, we present
a novel and alternate way to determine vocal fold model parameters from the
speech signal. We focus on an asymmetric model and show that for such models,
differences in estimated parameters can be successfully used to discriminate
between voices that are characteristic of different underlying vocal fold
pathologies.

incorporate prior knowledge (e.g., preference of basis functions, operators and
raw features) to improve the efficiency of fitting SR. Secondly, to improve
interpretability of expressions in SR, we aim to capture concise but
informative signals. To this end, we assume the expected signal has an additive
structure, i.e., a linear combination of several concise expressions, whose
complexity is controlled by a well-designed prior distribution. In our setup,
each expression is characterized by a symbolic tree, and the proposed SR model
could be solved by sampling symbolic trees from the posterior distribution
using an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Finally, compared
with GP, the proposed BSR(Bayesian Symbolic Regression) method saves computer
memory with no need to keep an updated 'genome pool'. Numerical experiments
show that, compared with GP, the solutions of BSR are closer to the ground
truth and the expressions are more concise. Meanwhile we find the solution of
BSR is robust to hyper-parameter specifications such as the number of trees.

such an intrinsic frame which should be unique to the identical object shape
and consistent across different instances of the same category, e.g. the frame
axes of desks should be all roughly along the edges. Interestingly, the
principal component analysis exactly provides an effective way to define such a
frame, i.e. setting the principal components as the frame axes. As the
principal components have direction ambiguity caused by the sign-ambiguity of
eigenvector computation, there exist several intrinsic frames for each object.
In order to achieve absolute rotation invariance for a deep model, we adopt the
coordinates expressed in all intrinsic frames as inputs to obtain multiple
output features, which will be further aggregated as a final feature via a
self-attention module. Our method is theoretically rotation-invariant and can
be flexibly embedded into the current network architectures. Comprehensive

from lines. Previous methods based on conditional generative adversarial
networks (cGANs) have shown their power to generate visually plausible images
when a conditional image and an output image share well-aligned structures.
However, these models fail to synthesize face images with a whole set of
well-defined structures, e.g. eyes, noses, mouths, etc., especially when the
conditional line map lacks one or several parts. To address this problem, we
propose a conditional self-attention generative adversarial network (CSAGAN).
We introduce a conditional self-attention mechanism to cGANs to capture
long-range dependencies between different regions in faces. We also build a
multi-scale discriminator. The large-scale discriminator enforces the
completeness of global structures and the small-scale discriminator encourages
fine details, thereby enhancing the realism of generated face images. We
evaluate the proposed model on the CelebA-HD dataset by two perceptual user
studies and three quantitative metrics. The experiment results demonstrate that
our method generates high-quality facial images while preserving facial
structures. Our results outperform state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively
and qualitatively.

Offering F to resolve the dilemma, L is able to get a larger average pay-off.

for straightforward implementation of UI designs will greatly speed up this

wireframes as input rather than hand-drawn sketches. In this paper, we put
forward a novel approach wherein we employ a Deep Neural Network that is
trained on our custom database of such sketches to detect UI elements in the
input sketch. Detection of objects in sketches is a peculiar visual recognition
task that requires a specific solution that our deep neural network model
attempts to provide. The output from the network is a platform-independent UI
representation object. The UI representation object is a dictionary of
key-value pairs to represent the UI elements recognized along with their
properties. This is further consumed by our UI parser which creates code for
different platforms. The intrinsic platform-independence allows the model to
create a UI prototype for multiple platforms with single training. This
two-step approach without the need for two trained models improves over other
methods giving time-efficient results (average time: 129 ms) with good

first evidence of particle acceleration in novae was found in the 2006 eruption

As a consequence, emission of high-energy gamma-rays mainly from neutral pion
decay and inverse Compton scattering is expected. We aim to understand the
early shock evolution, when acceleration of particles can take place, in nova
explosions. To achieve this goal, we perform a multiwavelength study of the
2014 outburst of V745 Sco, a symbiotic recurrent nova similar to RS Oph. The
analysis of early Swift/XRT observations, simultaneous to the tentative Fermi
detection, is combined with Chandra and NuStar data, to get a global picture of
the nova ejecta and the red giant wind evolution. Early radio and IR data are
also compiled, providing information about the forward shock velocity and its
magnetic field. The comparison with the plasma properties of RS Oph shows
striking similarities, such as the skipping of the adiabatic phase occurring in
supernova remnants, a hint of particle acceleration. The multiwavelength study
of V745 Sco provides new insights into the evolution of the hot plasma in novae
and its interaction with the circumstellar material, a powerful tool to
understand the nature of the high-energy gamma-ray emission from symbiotic

issues like time-varying transmission intervals, time-varying transmission
delays, packet dropouts, scheduling and quantization effects, which lead to
non-vanishing network-induced errors and affect the tracking performances. As a
result, we develop a general hybrid system model for NQCSs with all
aforementioned issues. Based on the Lyapunov approach, sufficient conditions
are established to guarantee the stability of the tracking error with respect
to the non-vanishing network-induced errors. The obtained conditions lead to a
tradeoff between the maximally allowable transmission interval and the
maximally allowable delay. Furthermore, the existence of Lyapunov functions
satisfying the obtained conditions is studied. For specific time-scheduling
protocols (e.g., Round-Robin protocol and Try-Once-Discard protocol) and

strategy super-replicate the true claim in an appropriate sense? If the

of `heavy metals' by selective radiative levitation in hot subdwarf atmospheres
is suppressed if the star is too helium-rich.

approximate the original enclosed volume by the boundary surface. We
progressively select new medial balls, in a top-down style, to enlarge the

strategy is to encourage large medial balls while imposing given geometric
constraints. We further propose a speedup technique based on a provable
observation that the intersection of medial balls implies the adjacency of
power cells (in the sense of the power crust). We further elaborate the
selection rules in combination with two closely related applications. One
application is to develop an easy-to-use ball-stick modeling system that helps
non-professional users to quickly build a shape with only balls and wires, but
any penetration between two medial balls must be suppressed. The other
application is to generate porous structures with convex, compact (with a high
isoperimetric quotient) and shape-aware pores where two adjacent spherical

(FDL) in information-theoretic terms relying on the analytical approach and on
the tools already used in the study of the information bottleneck (IB). It has
been conjectured that the behavior of FDL algorithms could be expressed as an
optimization problem over two information-theoretic quantities: the mutual
information of the data with the learned representations and the entropy of the
learned distribution. In particular, such a formulation was offered in order to
explain the success of the most prominent FDL algorithm, sparse filtering (SF).
This conjecture was, however, left unproven. In this work, we aim at providing
preliminary empirical support to this conjecture by performing experiments
reminiscent of the work done on deep neural networks in the context of the IB
research. Specifically, we borrow the idea of using information planes to
analyze the behavior of the SF algorithm and gain insights on its dynamics. A
confirmation of the conjecture about the dynamics of FDL may provide solid
ground to develop information-theoretic tools to assess the quality of the
learning process in FDL, and it may be extended to other unsupervised learning
algorithms.

that discrepancy admits favorable properties for training GANs and prove

three novel curriculum learning strategies for training GANs. All strategies
are first based on ranking the training images by their difficulty scores,
which are estimated by a state-of-the-art image difficulty predictor. Our first
strategy is to divide images into gradually more difficult batches. Our second
strategy introduces a novel curriculum loss function for the discriminator that
takes into account the difficulty scores of the real images. Our third strategy
is based on sampling from an evolving distribution, which favors the easier
images during the initial training stages and gradually converges to a uniform
distribution, in which samples are equally likely, regardless of difficulty. We
compare our curriculum learning strategies with the classic training procedure
on two tasks: image generation and image translation. Our experiments indicate
that all strategies provide faster convergence and superior results. For
example, our best curriculum learning strategy applied on spectrally normalized
GANs (SNGANs) fooled human annotators in thinking that generated CIFAR-like
images are real in 25.0% of the presented cases, while the SNGANs trained using
the classic procedure fooled the annotators in only 18.4% cases. Similarly, in

It is found that the number of extracted components varies between the examined

for more classes. A Monte Carlo testing implies that these additional
components are likely to be artifacts owing to the finiteness of the data and
be a result of examining a particular realization of the data as a random

us to train a binary classifier only from two unlabeled datasets with different

works as if it is a supervised classification method, compatible with any model
and optimizer. However, this method sometimes suffers from severe overfitting,
which we would like to prevent in this paper. Our empirical finding in applying
the original UU method is that overfitting often co-occurs with the empirical
risk going negative, which is not legitimate. Therefore, we propose to wrap the
terms that cause a negative empirical risk by certain correction functions.
Then, we prove the consistency of the corrected risk estimator and derive an

asymptotically equal to $(\log n)/n$. We consider analogous problems where
edges have not only a random length but also a random cost, and we are
interested in the length of the minimum-length structure whose total cost is
less than some cost budget. For several classes of structures, we determine the
correct minimum length structure as a function of the cost-budget, up to
constant factors. Moreover, we achieve this even in the more general setting
where the distribution of weights and costs are arbitrary, so long as the
density $f(x)$ as $x\to 0$ behaves like $cx^\gamma$ for some $\gamma\geq 0$;
previously, this case was not understood even in the absence of cost
constraints. We also handle the case where each edge has several independent
costs associated to it, and we must simultaneously satisfy budgets on each
cost. In this case, we show that the minimum-length structure obtainable is
essentially controlled by the product of the cost thresholds.

depletes the initial relativistic pressure at the x-line and collisionless

bursty nature of anti-parallel reconnection because a once opened outflow
exhaust can also collapse, which repeatedly triggers secondary tearing islands.
However, a stable single x-line reconnection can be achieved when an external

bracket on the span of directed closed curves. The purpose of this work is to
deepen the understanding of the former Lie bracket which will be referred to as
the Thurston-Wolpert-Goldman Lie bracket or, briefly, the TWG bracket.
  We give a local direct geometric definition of the TWG bracket and use this
geometric point of view to prove three results: firstly, the center of the
TWG-bracket is the Lie sub algebra generated by the class of the trivial loop
and the classes of loops parallel to boundary components or punctures; secondly
the analogous result hold for the centers of the universal enveloping algebra
and of the symmetric algebra determined by the TWG Lie algebra; and thirdly, in
terms of the natural basis, the TWG bracket of two non-central curves is always
a linear combination of non-central curves. We also give a brief and more
illuminating proof of a known result, namely, the TWG bracket counts
intersection.
  We conclude by discussing substantial computer evidence suggesting an
unexpected and strong conjectural statement relating the intersection structure
of curves and the TWG bracket, namely, if the TWG bracket of two distinct
undirected curves is zero then these curve classes have disjoint
representatives.

Concerning the fundamental analysis problem of comparing a candidate

that timed trace equivalence is undecidable, whereas timed bisimulation
equivalence is decidable. The corresponding proof utilizes region graphs, a
finite, but generally very space-consuming characterization of TA semantics.
Hence, most practical TA tools utilize zone graphs instead, a symbolic and
generally more efficient representation of TA semantics, to automate analysis
tasks. However, zone graphs only produce sound results for analysis tasks being
reducible to plain reachability problems thus being too imprecise for checking
timed bisimilarity. In this paper, we propose bounded zone-history graphs, a
novel characterization of TA semantics facilitating an adjustable trade-off

generalized Robbins' formula via solving a scalable convex program, which is
carefully developed based on a RKHS representation of the Stein's discrepancy
measure. The new NEB estimation framework is flexible for incorporating various
structural constraints into the data driven rule, and provides a unified
approach to compound estimation with both regular and scaled squared error

strong asymptotic properties. Comprehensive simulation studies as well as

focussing on the two-dimensional tilted Dirac cones in the organic salt

In combined analyses based on renormalization-group approaches and ladder

Comparative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments show good agreements

extend its function of tolerance factor into the structural identification of
the arrangement of disorder atoms; another data-set about the density

Beurling-Lax-Halmos Theorem, which characterizes the shift-invariant subspaces
of vector-valued Hardy spaces. The Beurling-Lax-Halmos Theorem states that a
backward shift-invariant subspace is a model space $\mathcal{H}(\Delta) \equiv
H_E^2 \ominus \Delta H_{E}^2$, for some inner function $\Delta$. Our first
question calls for a description of the set $F$ in $H_E^2$ such that
$\mathcal{H}(\Delta)=E_F^*$, where $E_F^*$ denotes the smallest backward
shift-invariant subspace containing the set $F$. In our pursuit of a general
solution to this question, we are naturally led to take into account a
canonical decomposition of operator-valued strong $L^2$-functions. Next, we
ask: Is every shift-invariant subspace the kernel of a (possibly unbounded)
Hankel operator? As we know, the kernel of a Hankel operator is
shift-invariant, so the above question is equivalent to seeking a solution to
the equation $\ker H_{\Phi}^*=\Delta H_{E^{\prime}}^2$, where $\Delta$ is an
inner function satisfying $\Delta^* \Delta=I_{E^{\prime}}$ almost everywhere on
the unit circle $\mathbb{T}$ and $H_{\Phi}$ denotes the Hankel operator with
symbol $\Phi$. Consideration of the above question on the structure of
shift-invariant subspaces leads us to study and coin a new notion of ""Beurling
degree"" for an inner function. We then establish a deep connection between the
spectral multiplicity of the model operator and the Beurling degree of the
corresponding characteristic function. At the same time, we consider the notion
of meromorphic pseudo-continuations of bounded type for operator-valued
functions, and then use this notion to study the spectral multiplicity of model
operators (truncated backward shifts) between separable complex Hilbert spaces.
In particular, we consider the multiplicity-free case.

applications, the canonical decoding procedure with left-to-right generation

human revising a sentence to obtain a refined result. In this work, we propose
XL-Editor, a novel training framework that enables state-of-the-art generalized
autoregressive pretraining methods, XLNet specifically, to revise a given
sentence by the variable-length insertion probability. Concretely, XL-Editor
can (1) estimate the probability of inserting a variable-length sequence into a
specific position of a given sentence; (2) execute post-editing operations such
as insertion, deletion, and replacement based on the estimated variable-length
insertion probability; (3) complement existing sequence-to-sequence models to
refine the generated sequences. Empirically, we first demonstrate better
post-editing capabilities of XL-Editor over XLNet on the text insertion and
deletion tasks, which validates the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
Furthermore, we extend XL-Editor to the unpaired text style transfer task,
where transferring the target style onto a given sentence can be naturally
viewed as post-editing the sentence into the target style. XL-Editor achieves
significant improvement in style transfer accuracy and also maintains coherent
semantic of the original sentence, showing the broad applicability of our
method.

to classify the distresses and to train the deep learning frameworks, while the

most critical being the issue of how we can ensure the safety of all drivers
and passengers. Findings from our analysis identify that tough weather and road
conditions, senior/teen drivers and dangerous intersections play prominent
roles in accidents that resulted in injuries in Massachusetts. These new
findings can provide valuable references and scientific data support to
relevant authorities and policy makers for upgrading road infrastructure,
passing regulations, etc.

abelian group $G$ with respect to a closed subgroup of the dual group
$\widehat{G}$. Using a range function approach, we establish a characterization
of modulation invariant spaces. Finally, we define a metric on the collection
of all modulation invariant spaces and study some topological properties of the
metric space.

multi-channel receiver down converters and distributed power distribution
networks leads to design and analysis of the receive signal path more complex.
In this paper receive signal path design of a typical 1000 T/R modules based
fully distributed active phased array radar is discussed in detail including
the gain, Spurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) requirements at different levels.
The techniques for optimization of SFDR and system performance also described
along with the Systemvue model to receive path calculations is presented.

  Codes",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Here we have proposed two decoding strategies of low-density parity-check
(LDPC) codes over Markov noise channels with bit flipping noise. The
sum-product algorithm used for decoding LDPC codes over memoryless channels is
extended to include channel estimation and how much gain we obtain by doing so
is simulated and verified. LDPC codes have been studied for years over
memoryless channels and are known to have excellent performance. However, these
codes over channels with memory is the topic of current research. Here,
channels with memory are characterized by Markov modeling which is a useful
busty channel model. With sufficient no. of states, they are able to model
sufficient noise characteristics. We have gone for a two-state system as it
shows a good compromise between complexity and performance.
