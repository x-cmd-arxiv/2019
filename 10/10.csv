both the developing and developed world, yet little research exists examining
the society-wide outcomes of an unconditional cash transfer program disbursed
without means-testing. This paper attempts to determine the impact of direct
cash transfers on educational outcomes in a developed society by investigating
the impacts of the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend, which was launched in 1982
and continues to be disbursed on an annual basis to every Alaskan. A synthetic
control model is deployed to examine the path of educational attainment among
Alaskans between 1977 and 1991 in order to determine if high school status
completion rates after the launch of the dividend diverge from the synthetic in
a manner suggestive of a treatment effect.

a statistical population may play a crucial role in this regard, anomalies
corresponding to observations with 'small' depth. Supported by sound
theoretical and computational developments in the recent decades, it has proven
to be extremely useful, in particular in functional spaces. However, most
approaches documented in the literature consist in evaluating independently the
centrality of each point forming the time series and consequently exhibit a
certain insensitivity to possible shape changes. In this paper, we propose a
novel notion of functional depth based on the area of the convex hull of

envelope of the data, in a natural fashion. We discuss practical relevance of
commonly imposed axioms on functional depths and investigate which of them are
satisfied by the notion of depth we promote here. Estimation and computational

Bayesian set optimization, and a class introduced here called ``Deep

suffer from a lack of strict positive definiteness, vast subclasses of DE
kernels built upon DS kernels do possess this property, enabling in turn
combinatorial optimization without requiring to introduce a jitter parameter.
Proofs of theoretical results about considered kernels are complemented by a
few practicalities regarding hyperparameter fitting. We furthermore demonstrate
the applicability of our approach in prediction and optimization tasks, relying
both on toy examples and on two test cases from mechanical engineering and

as well as planetary interiors - recent observations and theoretical studies of
the Earth's magnetic field seem to indicate the presence of a thin, stably
stratified layer at the top of the liquid outer core. We present direct
numerical simulations of this region, which is modelled as an axisymmetric
spherical Couette flow for a stably stratified fluid embedded in a dipolar
magnetic field. For strong magnetic fields, a super-rotating shear layer,
rotating nearly 30% faster than the imposed rotation rate difference between
the inner convective dynamo region and the outer boundary, is generated in the
stably stratified region. In the Earth context, and contrary to what was
previously believed, we show that this super-rotation may extend towards the
Earth magnetostrophic regime if the density stratification is sufficiently
large. The corresponding differential rotation triggers magnetohydrodynamic
instabilities and waves in the stratified region, which feature growth rates
comparable to the observed timescale for geomagnetic secular variations and
jerks. In the stellar context, we perform a linear analysis which shows that
similar instabilities are likely to arise, and we argue that it may play a role
in explaining the observed magnetic dichotomy among intermediate-mass stars.

that the set which can occur on a smooth elliptic Calabi-Yau $n$-fold for
($n\geq 3$) is contained in the set of subgroups which appear on a rational
elliptic surface, and is slightly larger for $n = 2$. The key idea in our proof
is showing that any elliptic fibration with sufficiently large torsion has
singularities in codimension 2 which do not admit a crepant resolution. We
prove this by explicitly constructing and studying maps to a modular curve
whose existence is predicted by a universal property. We use the geometry of
modular curves to explain the minimal singularities that appear on an elliptic
fibration with prescribed torsion, and to determine the degree of the
fundamental line bundle (hence the Kodaira dimension) of the universal elliptic
surface which we show to be consistent with explicit Weierstrass models. The
constraints from the modular curves are used to bound the first fundamental
group of any gauge group $G$ in a supergravity theory obtained from F-theory.

have a heterotic dual, nor can they be compactified to lower dimensional

by studies on pristine YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ in Paschen et al. and Friedemann et al.,
isothermal crossed-field and single-field Hall effect measurements are
necessary to ascertain the evolution of the Fermi surface across this QCP.
Because Schubert et al. did not carry out such measurements, their results on
Fe- and Ni-substituted YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ cannot be used to assess the validity of
the Kondo destruction picture neither for substituted nor for pristine
YbRh$_2$Si$_2$. Secondly, when referring to the data of Friedemann et al. on
the isothermal crossover of YbRh$_2$Si$_2$, they did not recognize the
implications of the crossover width, quantified by the full width at half
maximum (FWHM), being linear in temperature, with zero offset, over about $1.5$
decades in temperature, from 30 mK to 1 K. Finally, in claiming deviations of
Hall crossover FWHM data of Friedemann et al. from the above linear-in-$T$
dependence they neglected the error bars of these measurements and discarded
some of the data points. The claims of Schubert et al. are thus not supported
by data, neither previously published nor new (Ref. 1). As such they cannot
invalidate the evidence that has been reported for Kondo destruction quantum
criticality in YbRh$_2$Si$_2$.

Alekseev-Grosse-Schomerus and Buffenoir-Roche in the middle of the 1990's, in
the program of combinatorial quantization of the moduli space of flat
connections over the surface $\Sigma_{g,n}$ of genus $g$ with $n$ open disks
removed. In this thesis we apply these algebras $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}(H)$ to
low-dimensional topology (mapping class groups and skein algebras of surfaces),
under the assumption that the gauge algebra $H$ is a finite dimensional
factorizable ribbon Hopf algebra which is not necessarily semisimple, the
guiding example being the restricted quantum group $\bar U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$
(where $q$ is a $2p$-th root of unity).
  First, we construct from $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}(H)$ a projective representation
of the mapping class group of $\Sigma_{g,0}$. We provide formulas for the
representations of Dehn twists generating the mapping class group and we use
these formulas to show that our representation is equivalent to the one
constructed by Lyubashenko--Majid and Lyubashenko via categorical methods. For
the torus $\Sigma_{1,0}$ with the gauge algebra $\bar U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, we
compute explicitly the representation of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ and we
determine its structure.
  Second, we introduce a diagrammatic description of $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}(H)$
which enables us to define in a very natural way the Wilson loop map $W$. This
map associates an element of $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}(H)$ to any link in
$(\Sigma_{g,n} \!\setminus\! D) \times [0,1]$ which is framed, oriented and
colored by $H$-modules. When the gauge algebra is $H = \bar
U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, we use $W$ and the representations of
$\mathcal{L}_{g,n}(H)$ to construct representations of the skein algebras
$\mathcal{S}_q(\Sigma_{g,n})$ for $q$ a $2p$-th root of unity. For the torus
$\Sigma_{1,0}$ we explicitly study this representation.

habitability on rocky planets. Despite its chemical inertness, nitrogen
molecule is broken by lightning, hot volcanic vents, and bolide impacts, and
can be converted into soluble nitrogen compounds and then sequestered in the
ocean. The very stability of nitrogen, and that of nitrogen-based habitability,
is thus called into question. Here we determine the lifetime of molecular
nitrogen vis-a-vis aqueous sequestration, by developing a novel model that
couples atmospheric photochemistry and oceanic chemistry. We find that HNO, the
dominant nitrogen compounds produced in anoxic atmospheres, is converted to N2O
in the ocean, rather than oxidized to nitrites or nitrates as previously
assumed. This N2O is then released back into the atmosphere and quickly
converted to N2. We also find that the deposition rate of NO is severely
limited by the kinetics of the aqueous-phase reaction that converts NO to
nitrites in the ocean. Putting these insights together, we conclude that the
atmosphere must produce nitrogen species at least as oxidized as NO2 and HNO2
to enable aqueous sequestration. The lifetime of molecular nitrogen in anoxic
atmospheres is determined to be >1 billion years on temperate planets of both
Sun-like and M dwarf stars. This result upholds the validity of molecular
nitrogen as a universal background gas on rocky planets.

inevitable problem in continual learning models for dynamic environments. To
address this issue, we propose a method, called Continual Bayesian Learning

adapt to new tasks without forgetting the previously learned tasks. Using a
Bayesian Neural Network, CBLN maintains a mixture of Gaussian posterior

tries to optimise the number of resources that are needed to learn each task
and avoids an exponential increase in the number of resources that are involved

evaluated our method on the MNIST and UCR time-series datasets. The evaluation

are acquired in a rough-wall turbulent boundary layer that develops in a

considered in order to investigate the influence of the emission conditions on
the plume dynamics. The analysis is focused on the effects of the meandering
motion and the relative dispersion. First, classical statistics are
investigated. We found that (in accordance with previous studies) the
meandering motion is the main responsible for differences in the variance and
intermittency, as well as the kurtosis and power spectral density, between the
two source sizes. On the contrary, the mean and the skewness are slightly
affected by the emission conditions. To characterize the temporal structure of
the turbulent transport series, the visibility algorithm is exploited to carry
out a complex network-based analysis. Two network metrics -- the average peak
occurrence and the assortativity coefficient -- are analysed, as they can
capture the temporal occurrence of extreme events and their relative intensity
in the series. The effects of the meandering motion and the relative dispersion
of the plume are discussed in the view of the network metrics, revealing that a
stronger meandering motion is associated with higher values of both the average
peak occurrence and the assortativity coefficient. The network-based analysis
advances the level of information of classical statistics, by characterizing
the impact of the emission conditions on the temporal structure of the signals
in terms of extreme events and their relative intensity. In this way, complex
networks provide -- through the evaluation of network metrics -- an effective
tool for time-series analysis of experimental data.

2770 deg$^2$ SPTpol Extended Cluster Survey (SPT-ECS). Clusters are identified
via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, and confirmed with a combination of
archival and targeted follow-up data, making particular use of data from the
Dark Energy Survey (DES). With incomplete followup we have confirmed as
clusters 244 of 266 candidates at a detection significance $\xi \ge 5$ and an
additional 204 systems at $4<\xi<5$. The confirmed sample has a median mass of
$M_{500c} \sim {4.4 \times 10^{14} M_\odot h_{70}^{-1}}$, a median redshift of
$z=0.49$, and we have identified 44 strong gravitational lenses in the sample
thus far. Radio data are used to characterize contamination to the SZ signal;
the median contamination for confirmed clusters is predicted to be $\sim$1% of
the SZ signal at the $\xi>4$ threshold, and $<4\%$ of clusters have a predicted
contamination $>10\% $ of their measured SZ flux. We associate SZ-selected
clusters, from both SPT-ECS and the SPT-SZ survey, with clusters from the DES
redMaPPer sample, and find an offset distribution between the SZ center and
central galaxy in general agreement with previous work, though with a larger
fraction of clusters with significant offsets. Adopting a fixed Planck-like
cosmology, we measure the optical richness-to-SZ-mass ($\lambda-M$) relation
and find it to be 28% shallower than that from a weak-lensing analysis of the
DES data---a difference significant at the 4 $\sigma$ level---with the
relations intersecting at $\lambda=60$ . The SPT-ECS cluster sample will be
particularly useful for studying the evolution of massive clusters and, in
combination with DES lensing observations and the SPT-SZ cluster sample, will
be an important component of future cosmological analyses.

VDES J0224$-$4711 at $z=6.526$) and six other quasars with $6.438 < z < 6.747$
from the XMM-Newton public archive. Two of the nine quasars are detected at a
high ($>$4$\sigma$) significance level: VDES J0224$-$4711(z=6.53) at $9\sigma$
and PSO J159$-$02 ($z=6.38$) at $8\sigma$. They have a photon index of
$\Gamma=1.82^{+0.29}_{-0.27}$ and $\Gamma=1.94^{+0.31}_{-0.29}$ respectively,
which is consistent with the mean value of $\sim1.9$ found for quasars at all
redshifts. The rest-frame $2-10$ keV luminosity of VDES J0224$-$4711, is
$L_{2-10\mathrm{keV}} = (2.92\pm0.43)\times10^{45}\;\mathrm{erg\;s^{-1}}$,
which makes this quasar one of the most X-ray luminous quasars at $z>5.5$ and
the most X-ray luminous quasar at $z>6.5$, with a luminosity 6 times and 2.5
times larger than ULAS J1120+0641 ($z=7.08$) and ULAS J1342+0928 ($z=7.54$)

consistent with the previously observed anti-correlation of $\alpha_{ox}$ with
UV luminosity $L_{2500\mathrm{\AA}}$. We find no evidence for evolution of
$\alpha_{ox}$ with redshift when the anti-correlation with UV luminosity is
taken into account. Similar to previous studies at z$\sim$6 we have found
remarkably consistent X-ray spectral properties between low (z$\sim$1) and
high-redshift quasars. Our results add further evidence to the picture that the
observable properties of high luminosity quasars over the UV to X-ray spectral
region have not evolved significantly from $z\sim7$ to the present day and that
quasars comparable to local versions existed 800 million years after the big
bang.

period of 12.1 seconds, the second longest currently known. Its timing
parameters imply a characteristic age of 15 Myr, a surface magnetic field of
$1.3 \times 10^{13}$~G and a spin-down luminosity of $2.9 \times

1.3 kpc according to the NE2001 and YMW16 Galactic free electron density
models, respectively. Some of its single pulses show an uninterrupted 180
degree sweep of the phase-resolved polarization position angle, with an S-shape
reminiscent of the rotating vector model prediction. However, the fact that
this sweep occurs at different phases from one pulse to another is remarkable
and without straightforward explanation. Although PSR~J2251$-$3711 lies in the
region of the $P-\dot{P}$ parameter space occupied by the X-ray Isolated
Neutron Stars (XINS), there is no evidence for an X-ray counterpart in our
Swift XRT observation; this places a 99\%-confidence upper bound on its
unabsorbed bolometric thermal luminosity of $1.1 \times 10^{31}~(d /

$d$ is the distance to the pulsar. Further observations are needed to determine
whether it is a rotation-powered pulsar with a true age of at least several
Myr, or a much younger object such as an XINS or a recently cooled magnetar.
Extreme specimens like PSR J2251$-$3711 help bridge populations in the

sharing are happening all the time, and it is real-time. When a user initiates
an activity in OSNs, immediately, he/she will have a certain influence in
his/her friendship circle naturally, some users in the initiator's friendship
circle will be attracted to participate in this activity. Based on such a fact,
we design a k-hop Collaborate Game Model, which means that an activity
initiated by a user can only influence those users whose distance are within
k-hop from this initiator in OSNs. Besides, we introduce the problem of Revenue
Maximization under k-hop Collaborate Game (RMKCG), which identifies a limited
number of initiators in order to obtain revenue as much as possible.
Collaborate Game Model describes in detail how to quantify revenue and the
logic behind it. We do not know how many followers would be generated from an
activity in advance, thus, we need to adopt an adaptive strategy, where the
decision who is the next potential initiator depends on the results of past
decisions. Adaptive RMKCG problem can be considered as a new stochastic
optimization problem, and we prove it is NP-hard, adaptive monotone, but not
adaptive submodular. But in some special cases, it is adaptive submodular and
an adaptive greedy strategy can obtain a $(1-1/e)$-approximation by adaptive
submodularity theory. Due to the complexity of our model, it is hard to compute
the marginal gain for each candidate user, then, we propose a convenient and
efficient computational method. The effectiveness and correctness of our
algorithms are validated by heavy simulation on real-world social networks
eventually.

databases that contain private data. The strength of differential privacy lies
in a rigorous mathematical definition that guarantees individual privacy and
yet allows for accurate statistical results. Thanks to its mathematical
definition, differential privacy is also a natural target for formal analysis.
A broad line of work uses logical methods for proving privacy. However, these
methods are not complete, and only partially automated. A recent and
complementary line of work uses statistical methods for finding privacy
violations. However, the methods only provide statistical guarantees (but no
proofs).
  We propose the first decision procedure for checking the differential privacy
of a non-trivial class of probabilistic computations. Our procedure takes as
input a program P parametrized by a privacy budget $\epsilon$, and either
proves differential privacy for all possible values of $\epsilon$ or generates
a counterexample. In addition, our procedure applies both to
$\epsilon$-differential privacy and $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy.
Technically, the decision procedure is based on a novel and judicious encoding
of the semantics of programs in our class into a decidable fragment of the
first-order theory of the reals with exponentiation. We implement our procedure
and use it for (dis)proving privacy bounds for many well-known examples,

which, when quantized, leads to topological phases of matter. Such a
formulation has recently been extended to higher electric multipole moments,
through the discovery of the so-called quadupole topological insulator. It has
been established by a classical electromagnetic theory that in a
two-dimensional material the quantized properties for the quadupole topological
insulator should satisfy a basic relation. Here we discover a new type of
quadrupole topological insulator (dubbed type-II) that violates this relation
due to the breakdown of the correspondence that a Wannier band and an edge
energy spectrum close their gaps simultaneously. We find that, similar to the
previously discovered (referred to as type-I) quadrupole topological insulator,
the type-II hosts topologically protected corner states carrying fractional
corner charges. However, the edge polarizations only occur at a pair of
boundaries in the type-II insulating phase, leading to the violation of the
classical constraint. We demonstrate that such new topological phenomena can
appear from quench dynamics in non-equilibrium systems, which can be
experimentally observed in ultracold atomic gases. We also propose an
experimental scheme with electric circuits to realize such a new topological
phase of matter. The existence of the new topological insulating phase means
that new multipole topological insulators with distinct properties can exist in
broader contexts beyond classical constraints.

addition, the CO overtone band at 2.3 $\mu$m was observed by iSHELL to
characterize the gas on the line of sight. The H$_3^+$ ion was detected toward
CRL 2136 IRS 1 as in previous observations. Spectroscopy of lines of H$_2$D$^+$

respectively. The population diagram for CO is reproduced by two components of
warm gas with the temperatures 58 K and 530 K, assuming a local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE) distribution of the rotational levels. Cold gas ($<$20 K)
makes only a minor contribution to the CO molecular column toward CRL 2136 IRS
1. The critical conditions for deuterium fractionation in a dense cloud are low
temperature and CO depletion. Given the revised cloud properties, it is no
surprise that H$_3^+$ isotopologues are not detected toward CRL 2136 IRS 1. The

the baryon cycle of low-mass galaxies. However, observational constraints of
winds in nearby dwarf galaxies are limited as outflows are transient,
intrinsically low-surface brightness features, and, thus, difficult to detect.
Using deep Hapha observations, we search for winds in a sample of twelve nearby
dwarfs (M_* ~ 10^7 - 10^9.3 Msun) which host on-going or recent starbursts. We
detect features which we classify as winds in 6 galaxies, fountain candidates
in 5 galaxies, and diffuse ISM in 1 system. Winds are found preferentially in
galaxies with centrally concentrated star formation, while fountains are found
in galaxies with spatially distributed star formation. We suggest that the
concentration of star formation is a predictor for whether a low-mass galaxy
will develop a wind. The spatial extent of all detected ionized gas is limited
(<1/10 virial radius) and would still be considered the ISM by cosmological
simulations. Our observations suggest that the majority of material expelled
from dwarfs does not escape to the intergalactic medium but remains in the halo
and may be recycled to the galaxies. Derived mass-loading factors range from

galaxy formation over $0.2 < z < 3$ inferred with the \texttt{Prospector}
galaxy SED-fitting code. In this work, Paper I, we present the evolution of the
galaxy stellar mass function using new mass measurements of $\sim$10$^5$
galaxies in the 3D-HST and COSMOS-2015 surveys. We employ a new methodology to
infer the mass function from the observed stellar masses: instead of fitting
independent mass functions in a series of fixed redshift intervals, we
construct a continuity model that directly fits for the redshift evolution of
the mass function. This approach ensures a smooth picture of galaxy assembly
and makes use of the full, non-Gaussian uncertainty contours in our stellar
mass inferences. The resulting mass function has higher number densities at a
fixed stellar mass than almost any other measurement in the literature, largely
owing to the older stellar ages inferred by \texttt{Prospector}. The stellar
mass density is $\sim$50% higher than previous measurements, with the offset
peaking at $z\sim1$. The next two papers in this series will present the new
measurements of star-forming main sequence and the cosmic star formation rate

pair production through an off-shell Higgs boson, which is analyzed in the
vector boson fusion channel. A variety of future high-energy lepton colliders
as well as hadron colliders are considered, including CLIC, a muon collider,
the High-Luminosity and High-Energy versions of the LHC, and FCC-hh.
Implications on the parameter space of pNGB Dark Matter are discussed. In
addition, we give improved and extended results for the collider reach on the
marginal Higgs portal, under the assumption that the new scalars escape the
detector, as motivated by a variety of beyond the Standard Model scenarios.

the cosmological constraints from peak and minimum counts. Using the
\texttt{MassiveNuS} simulations, we find that lensing minima are sensitive to
non-Gaussian cosmological information and are complementary to the lensing
power spectrum and peak counts. For an LSST-like survey, we obtain $95\%$
credible intervals from a combination of lensing minima and peaks that are
significantly stronger than from the power spectrum alone, by $44\%$, $11\%$,
and $63\%$ for the neutrino mass sum $\sum m_\nu$, matter density $\Omega_m$,
and amplitude of fluctuation $A_s$, respectively. We explore the effect of
baryonic processes on lensing minima and peaks using the hydrodynamical
simulations \texttt{BAHAMAS} and \texttt{Osato15}. We find that ignoring
baryonic effects would lead to strong ($\approx 4 \sigma$) biases in inferences
from peak counts, but negligible ($\approx 0.5 \sigma$) for minimum counts,
suggesting lensing minima are a potentially more robust tool against baryonic
effects. Finally, we demonstrate that the biases can in principle be mitigated
without significantly degrading cosmological constraints when we model and
marginalize the baryonic effects.

widths of interstellar absorption features using stacked spectra in bins of

strong correlation between decreasing low-ionization absorption strength and
increasing Ly$\alpha$ emission strength over the redshift range z~2-5,
suggesting that both of these quantities are fundamentally linked to neutral

evolution at $z\sim5$ towards greater Ly$\alpha$ emission strength at fixed
low-ionization absorption strength. If we interpret the non-evolving
relationship of Ly$\alpha$ emission strength and low-ionization line strength
at z~2-4 as primarily reflecting the radiative transfer of Ly$\alpha$ photons,
this evolution at z~5 suggests a higher intrinsic production rate of Ly$\alpha$
photons than at lower redshift. Our conclusion is supported by the joint
evolution of the relationships among Ly$\alpha$ emission strength, interstellar
absorption strength, and dust reddening. We perform additional analysis in bins
of stellar mass, star-formation rate, UV luminosity, and age, examining how the
relationships between galaxy properties and Ly$\alpha$ emission evolve towards

convection fail to adequately describe the energy transport in superadiabatic
layers. The improper modelling leads to well-known discrepancies between
observed and predicted oscillation frequencies for stars with convective
envelopes. Recently, three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations of stellar
envelopes have been shown to facilitate a realistic depiction of superadiabatic
convection in 1D stellar models. The resulting structural changes of the
boundary layers have been demonstrated to impact not only the predicted
oscillation spectra but evolution tracks as well. In this paper, we quantify
the consequences that the change in boundary conditions has for stellar
parameter estimates of main-sequence stars. For this purpose, we investigate
two benchmark stars, Alpha Centauri A and B, using Bayesian inference. We show
that the improved treatment of turbulent convection makes the obtained 1D
stellar structures nearly insensitive to the mixing length parameter. By using
3D simulations in 1D stellar models, we hence overcome the degeneracy between
the mixing length parameter and other stellar parameters. By lifting this
degeneracy, the inclusion of 3D simulations has the potential to yield more
robust parameter estimates. In this way, a more realistic depiction of
superadiabatic convection has important implications for any field that relies
on stellar models, including the study of the chemical evolution of the Milky
Way Galaxy and exoplanet research.

amplitude information about the samples linear response. Phase modulation and
lock-in detection are introduced to increase detection signal-to-noise ratio
and implement a down-sampling technique for scanning the interferometer delay,
which reduces the sampling requirements needed to reproduce fully the temporal

flexibility were studied. With increasing flow rate and Weissenberg number, the
flow transitioned from a fore-aft symmetric flow to a stable detached vortex
upstream of the beam, to a time-dependent unstable vortex shedding. The
shedding of the unstable vortex upstream of the beam imposed a time-dependent
drag force on the cantilevered beam resulting in flow-induced beam
oscillations. The oscillations of the flexible beam were classified into two
distinct regimes: a regime with a clear single vortex shedding from upstream of
the beam resulting in a sinusoidal beam oscillation pattern with the frequency
of oscillation increasing monotonically with Weissenberg number, and a regime
at high Weissenberg numbers characterized by 3D chaotic flow instabilities
where the frequency of oscillations plateaued. The critical onset of the flow
transitions, the mechanism of vortex shedding and the dynamics of the

balance stems from two effects. The first is the \emph{anomalous dissipation}
of the solution, which has been studied in many contexts. The second is what we
call the \emph{anomalous work} done by the force, a phenomenon that has not
been analyzed before. There are numerous examples of solutions exhibiting
\emph{anomalous work}, for which even a continuous energy profile does not rule
out the anomalous dissipation, but only implies the balance of the strengths of
these two effects, which we confirm in explicit constructions. More
importantly, we show that there exist solutions exhibiting \emph{anomalous
dissipation} with zero \emph{anomalous work}. Hence the violation of the energy
balance results from the nonlinearity of the solution instead of artifacts of
the force. Such examples exist in the class $u \in L_t^{3 } B^{\frac{1}{3}

the latter case, the thin films exhibit a small uncompensated Mn moment in the

transition to a glassy ferromagnetic state at around 50 K, a peak in the Hall
resistivity close to the coercive field indicates the onset of a topological
Hall effect contribution, due to the emergence of a scalar spin chirality
generating a real-space Berry phase. We demonstrate that the polarity of this
topological Hall effect, and hence the chiral-nature of the noncoplanar

conditions.

discussed in the context of modeling of compressible fluid flows in elastic

thermodynamically compatible systems and on a model of nonlinear
elastoplasticity combined with a two-phase compressible fluid flow model. The
governing equations of the model include phase mass conservation laws, a total
momentum conservation law, an equation for the relative velocities of the
phases, an equation for mixture distortion, and a balance equation for
porosity. They form a hyperbolic system of conservation equations that satisfy
the fundamental laws of thermodynamics. Two types of phase interaction are
introduced in the model: phase pressure relaxation to a common value and
interfacial friction. Inelastic deformations also can be accounted for by
source terms in the equation for distortion. The thus formulated model can be
used for studying general compressible fluid flows in a deformable
elastoplastic porous medium, and for modeling wave propagation in a saturated
porous medium. Governing equations for small-amplitude wave propagation in a
uniform porous medium saturated with a single fluid are derived. They form a
first-order hyperbolic PDE system written in terms of stress and velocities
and, like in Biot's model, predict three types of waves existing in real
fluid-saturated porous media: fast and slow longitudinal waves and shear waves.

that practitioners stick to linear warmup with Adam, with a sensible default
being linear warmup over $2 / (1 - \beta_2)$ training iterations.

large amounts of language data to build models that can understand language.
However, most language data reflect the public discourse at the time the data
was produced, and hence NLP models are susceptible to learning incidental
associations around named referents at a particular point in time, in addition
to general linguistic meaning. An NLP system designed to model notions such as
sentiment and toxicity should ideally produce scores that are independent of
the identity of such entities mentioned in text and their social associations.
For example, in a general purpose sentiment analysis system, a phrase such as I
hate Katy Perry should be interpreted as having the same sentiment as I hate
Taylor Swift. Based on this idea, we propose a generic evaluation framework,
Perturbation Sensitivity Analysis, which detects unintended model biases
related to named entities, and requires no new annotations or corpora. We
demonstrate the utility of this analysis by employing it on two different NLP
models --- a sentiment model and a toxicity model --- applied on online
comments in English language from four different genres.

Noble Element Simulation Technique (NEST v2.0), electronic recoil data from the
$\beta$ decays of ${}^3$H and ${}^{14}$C in the Large Underground Xenon (LUX)
detector were used to tune the model, in addition to external data sets that
allow for extrapolation beyond the LUX data-taking conditions. This paper also
presents techniques used for modeling complicated temporal and spatial detector
pathologies that can adversely affect data using a simplified model framework.
The methods outlined in this report show an example of the robust applications
possible with NEST v2.0, while also providing the final electronic recoil model
and detector parameters that will used in the new analysis package, the LUX
Legacy Analysis Monte Carlo Application (LLAMA), for accurate reproduction of
the LUX data. As accurate background reproduction is crucial for the success of
rare-event searches, such as dark matter direct detection experiments, the
techniques outlined here can be used in other single-phase and dual-phase xenon

logic that has decidable satisfiability and model checking problems. The
decision procedures for MITL rely on the automata theoretic approach, where
logic formulas are translated into equivalent timed automata. Since timed
automata are not closed under complementation, decision procedures for MITL
first convert a formula into negated normal form before translating to a timed
automaton. We show that, unfortunately, these 20-year-old procedures are
incorrect, because they rely on an incorrect semantics of the R operator. We
present the right semantics of R and give new, correct decision procedures for
MITL. We show that both satisfiability and model checking for MITL are
EXPSPACE-complete, as was previously claimed. We also identify a fragment of
MITL that we call MITL_{WI} that is richer than MITL_{0,\infty}, for which we
show that both satisfiability and model checking are PSPACE-complete. Many of

top-ranked priority for a new ground-based facility in the 2000 Canadian Long
Range Plan. Ten years later, at the time of LRP2010, ALMA construction was well
underway, with first science observations anticipated for 2011. In the past 8
years, ALMA has proved itself to be a high-impact, high-demand observatory,
with record numbers of proposals submitted to the annual calls and large
numbers of highly cited scientific papers across fields from protoplanetary
disks to high-redshift galaxies and quasars.
  The LRP2010 ALMA white paper laid out 8 specific metrics that could be used
to judge the success of Canada's participation in ALMA. Among these metrics
were publications (number; impact), collaborations (international;
multi-wavelength), and student training. To call out one particular metric,
Canadians are making excellent use of ALMA in training graduate students and
postdocs: as of June 2018, 12 of 23 Canadian first-author papers were led by a
graduate student, and a further 4 papers were led by postdocs. All 8 metrics
argue for Canada's involvement in ALMA over the past decade to be judged a
success. The successful achievement of these wide-ranging goals argues strongly
for Canada's continuing participation in ALMA over the next decade and beyond.
  Looking forward, our community needs to: (1) maintain Canadian access to ALMA
and our competitiveness in using ALMA; (2) preserve full Canadian funding for
our share of ALMA operations; (3) identify components of ALMA development in
which Canada can play a significant role, including stimulating expertise in
submillimetre instrumentation to capitalize on future opportunities; and (4)
keep Canadians fully trained and engaged in ALMA, as new capabilities become
available, reaching the widest possible community of potential users.

eruptive active regions. Space missions such as Solar Orbiter or future Space
Weather forecasting missions would largely benefit from this achievement. Our
aim is to produce a relatively simple technique that can provide real time
indications or predictions that an active region will produce an eruption. We
expand on the theoretical work of \citet{Pagano2019fp} that was able to
distinguish eruptive from non-eruptive active regions. From this we introduce a
new operational metric that uses a combination of observed line-of-sight
magnetograms, 3D data-driven simulations and the projection of the 3D
simulations forward in time. Results show that the new metric correctly
distinguishes active regions as eruptive when observable signatures of eruption
have been identified and as non-eruptive when there are no observable
signatures of eruption. After successfully distinguishing eruptive from
non-eruptive active regions we illustrate how this metric may be used in a
""real-time"" operational sense were three levels of warning are categorised.
These categories are: high risk (red), medium risk (amber) and low risk (green)
of eruption. Through considering individual cases we find that the separation
into eruptive and non-eruptive active regions is more robust the longer the
time series of observed magnetograms used to simulate the build up of magnetic
stress and free magnetic energy within the active region. Finally, we conclude
that this proof of concept study delivers promising results where the ability
to categorise the risk of an eruption is a major achievement.

strains, such as in the process of a structural phase transformation, fails due
to the Bragg peak distortions. Here we present an advanced BCDI algorithm
enabling imaging three-dimensional strain fields in highly strained crystals.
We test the algorithm on particles simulated to undergo a structural phase
transformation. While the conventional algorithm fails in unambiguously
reconstructing the phase morphology, our algorithm correctly retrieves the
morphology of coexistent phases with a strain difference of 1%. The key novelty
is the simultaneous reconstruction of multiple scans of the same nanoparticle
at snapshots through the phase transformations. The algorithm enables
visualizing phase transformations in nanoparticles of lithium-ion, sodium-ion
nanoparticles, and other nanoparticulate materials in working conditions

subdwarf (sdB) pulsator, EC 21494-7018 (TIC 278659026), monitored in TESS first
sector using 120-second cadence. The light curve analysis reveals that EC
21494-7018 is a sdB pulsator counting up to 20 frequencies associated with
independent g-modes. The seismic analysis singles out an optimal model solution
in full agreement with independent measurements provided by spectroscopy
(atmospheric parameters derived from model atmospheres) and astrometry
(distance evaluated from Gaia DR2 trigonometric parallax). Several key
parameters of the star are derived. Its mass (0.391 +/- 0.009 Msun) is
significantly lower than the typical mass of sdB stars, and suggests that its
progenitor has not undergone the He-core flash, and therefore could originate
from a massive (>2 Msun) red giant, an alternative channel for the formation of
hot B subdwarfs. Other derived parameters include the H-rich envelope mass
(0.0037 +/- 0.0010 Msun), radius (0.1694 +/- 0.0081 Rsun), and luminosity
(8.2+/-1.1 Lsun). The optimal model fit has a double-layered He+H composition
profile, which we interpret as an incomplete but ongoing process of
gravitational settling of helium at the bottom of a thick H-rich envelope.
Moreover, the derived properties of the core indicate that EC 21494-7018 has
burnt ~43% (in mass) of its central helium and possesses a relatively large
mixed core (Mcore = 0.198 +/- 0.010 Msun), in line with trends already
uncovered from other g-mode sdB pulsators analysed with asteroseismology.
Finally, we obtain for the first time an estimate of the amount of oxygen (in
mass; X(O)core = 0.16 -0.05 +0.13) produced at this stage of evolution by an
helium-burning core. This result, along with the core-size estimate, is an
interesting constraint that may help to narrow down the still uncertain
C12(alpha,gamma)O16 nuclear reaction rate.

semimetal. In order to emphasize the effect of Zeeman splitting, we consider 3D
ZrTe$_5$ in a strong TI phase with a small band gap. With Zeeman splitting
greater than the band gap, the WFTB model suggests that a type-I nodal ring
protected by (glide) mirror symmetry is formed when the B field aligns with the
crystal $a$ or $b$ axes, and that a pair of type-I Weyl nodes are formed
otherwise, when conduction and valence bands touch. We show that a pair of Weyl
nodes can disappear through formation of a nodal ring, rather than requiring
two Weyl nodes with opposite chirality to come together. Interestingly, a
type-II nodal ring appears from crossings of the top two valence bands when the
B field is applied along the $c$ axis. This nodal ring gaps out to form type-II
Weyl nodes when the B field rotates in the $bc$ plane. Comparing the WFTB and
linearized $k \cdot p$ model, we find inadequacy of the latter at some B field
directions. Further, using the WFTB model, we numerically compute the intrinsic
anomalous Hall conductivity ${\sigma_{ac}}$ induced by Berry curvature as a
function of chemical potential and B field direction. We find that
${\sigma_{ac}}$ increases abruptly when the B field is tilted from the $a$ axis

First, I apply Cheng, Liao, Shi's (2019) averaging GMM framework to the IVQR
model. I propose using the usual quantile regression moments for averaging to
take advantage of cases when endogeneity is not too strong. I also propose
using two-stage least squares slope moments to take advantage of cases when
heterogeneity is not too strong. The empirical optimal weight formula of Cheng
et al. (2019) helps optimize the bias-variance tradeoff, ensuring uniformly
better (asymptotic) risk of the averaging estimator over the standard IVQR
estimator under certain conditions. My implementation involves many
computational considerations and builds on recent developments in the quantile
literature. Second, I propose a bootstrap method that directly averages among
IVQR, quantile regression, and two-stage least squares estimators. More
specifically, I find the optimal weights in the bootstrap world and then apply
the bootstrap-optimal weights to the original sample. The bootstrap method is
simpler to compute and generally performs better in simulations, but it lacks
the formal uniform dominance results of Cheng et al. (2019). Simulation results
demonstrate that in the multiple-regressors/instruments case, both the GMM
averaging and bootstrap estimators have uniformly smaller risk than the IVQR
estimator across data-generating processes (DGPs) with all kinds of
combinations of different endogeneity levels and heterogeneity levels. In DGPs
with a single endogenous regressor and instrument, where averaging estimation
is known to have least opportunity for improvement, the proposed averaging
estimators outperform the IVQR estimator in some cases but not others.

properties against input uncertainties or adversarial attacks have become an
important research area in learning-enabled systems. Most results concentrate
around the worst-case scenario where the input of the neural network is
perturbed within a norm-bounded uncertainty set. In this paper, we consider a
probabilistic setting in which the uncertainty is random with known first two
moments. In this context, we discuss two relevant problems: (i) probabilistic
safety verification, in which the goal is to find an upper bound on the
probability of violating a safety specification; and (ii) confidence ellipsoid
estimation, in which given a confidence ellipsoid for the input of the neural
network, our goal is to compute a confidence ellipsoid for the output. Due to
the presence of nonlinear activation functions, these two problems are very
difficult to solve exactly. To simplify the analysis, our main idea is to
abstract the nonlinear activation functions by a combination of affine and
quadratic constraints they impose on their input-output pairs. We then show
that the safety of the abstracted network, which is sufficient for the safety
of the original network, can be analyzed using semidefinite programming. We
illustrate the performance of our approach with numerical experiments.

by adding a reverse transition for each of its forward transitions. Secondly,
given a P/T net the standard unfolding construction associates with it an
occurrence net that preserves all of its computation. Consequently, the

protostar G45.47+0.05 using high-resolution observations at 1.3 mm with the
Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) and at 7 mm with the Karl
G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). By modeling the free-free continuum, the
ionized outflow is found to be a photoevaporation flow with an electron
temperature of 10,000 K and an electron number density of ~1.5x10^7 cm^-3 at
the center, launched from a disk of radius of 110 au. H30alpha hydrogen
recombination line emission shows strong maser amplification, with G45 being
one of very few sources to show such millimeter recombination line masers. The
mass of the driving source is estimated to be 30-50 Msun based on the derived
ionizing photon rate, or 30-40 Msun based on the H30alpha kinematics. The
kinematics of the photoevaporated material is dominated by rotation close to
the disk plane, while accelerated to outflowing motion above the disk plane.
The mass loss rate of the photoevaporation outflow is estimated to be
~(2-3.5)x10^-5 Msun/yr. We also found hints of a possible jet embedded inside
the wide-angle ionized outflow with non-thermal emissions. The possible
co-existence of a jet and a massive photoevaporation outflow suggests that, in
spite of the strong photoionization feedback, accretion is still on-going.

particular, we will describe two different approaches to account for DEM
uncertainty, namely unconditional and conditional stochastic simulation

uncertainty represented by stochastic simulations critically affects landslide
run-out simulations. Based upon a historic flow-like landslide event in Hong

can significantly affect simulation-based landslide run-out analyses, depending
on how well the underlying flow path is captured by the DEM, as well as further
topographic characteristics and the DEM error's variability. We further find
that in the absence of systematic bias in the DEM, a performant root mean
square error based unconditional stochastic simulation yields similar results
than a computationally intensive conditional stochastic simulation that takes
actual DEM error values at reference locations into account. In all other cases
the unconditional stochastic simulation overestimates the variability of the
DEM error, which leads to an increase of the potential hazard area as well as
extreme values of dynamic flow properties.

diversity of adversarial perturbations. Classical adversarial training uses
fixed, precomputed perturbations in adversarial examples (input space). In
contrast, we introduce dynamic adversarial perturbations into the parameter

automatically to these learned adversarial perturbations. Thus, we can achieve

that policy using reinforcement learning as these approaches are inherently
optimizing different objective functions. Previous works have used loss
functions, which combine behavior cloning losses with reinforcement learning
losses to enable this update. However, the components of these loss functions
are often set anecdotally, and their individual contributions are not well
understood. In this work, we propose the Cycle-of-Learning (CoL) framework that
uses an actor-critic architecture with a loss function that combines behavior
cloning and 1-step Q-learning losses with an off-policy pre-training step from
human demonstrations. This enables transition from behavior cloning to
reinforcement learning without performance degradation and improves
reinforcement learning in terms of overall performance and training time.
Additionally, we carefully study the composition of these combined losses and
their impact on overall policy learning. We show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques for combining behavior cloning and reinforcement
learning for both dense and sparse reward scenarios. Our results also suggest
that directly including the behavior cloning loss on demonstration data helps
to ensure stable learning and ground future policy updates.

evaluation of the Epionics SPINE system, a portable device for measuring
sagittal lumbar back motion during functional activities. Twenty healthy
participants were therefore evaluated with the Epionics SPINE and a Vicon
motion capture system in two identical separate research visits. They performed
the following activities: standing, sitting, chair rising, box lifting,
walking, running and a counter movement jump (CMJ). Lumbar lordosis angles were
extracted as continuous values as well as average and range of motion (ROM)
parameters. Agreement between the systems was evaluated using Bland-Altman
analyses, whereas within- and between-session reliability were assessed using
intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and minimal detectable changes (MDC).
The analysis showed excellent agreement between the systems for chair rising,
box lifting and CMJ with a systematic underestimation of lumbar lordosis angles
during walking and running. Reliability was moderate to high for all continuous
and discrete parameters (ICC>=0.62), except for ROM during running (ICC=0.29).
MDC values were generally below 15{\deg}, except for CMJ (peak values up to
20{\deg} within and 25{\deg} between the sessions). The Epionics SPINE system
performed similarly to a Vicon motion capture system for measuring lumbar
lordosis angles during functional activities and showed high consistency within
and between measurement sessions. These findings can serve researchers and
clinicians as a bench mark for future investigations using the system in
populations with spinal pathologies.

confined in a single spatial resonator, which is different from a conventional
PT-symmetric system in which the two modes are localized in two physically
separated resonators to form one-dimensional spatial potential symmetry as
required by the simplest one-dimensional parity transformation. We show that
PT-symmetry can be implemented between subspaces in non-spatial parameter
spaces, in which the gain and loss modes can perfectly overlay spatially but
are distinguishable in the designated parameter space. The resultant spatial
singularity enables the possibility in implementing PT-symmetric systems with
increased structural simplicity, integration density and long-term stability.
To prove the concept, a PT-symmetric optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) in the
optical wavelength space is implemented. The OEO has a single-loop
architecture, with the gain and loss microwave modes carried by two optical
wavelengths to form two mutually coupled wavelength-space resonators (WSRs).
PT-symmetry is achieved by controlling the wavelength spacing and the power
contrast. The operation of PT symmetry in the OEO is verified by the generation
of a 10-GHz microwave signal with a low phase noise of 129.3 dBc/Hz at 10-kHz

conversion based on a result of our latest axisymmetric core-collapse supernova
(CCSN) simulation with full Boltzmann neutrino transport. In the CCSN
simulation, coherent asymmetric neutrino emissions of electron-type neutrinos
($\nu_{\rm e}$) and their anti-particles ($\bar{\nu}_{\rm e}$), in which the
asymmetry of $\nu_{\rm e}$ and $\bar{\nu}_{\rm e}$ is anti-correlated with each
other, occur at almost the same time as the onset of aspherical shock
expansion. We find that the asymmetric neutrino emissions play a crucial role
on occurrences of fast flavor conversions. The linear analysis shows that
unstable modes appear in both pre- and post-shock flows; for the latter they
appear only in the hemisphere of higher $\bar{\nu}_{\rm e}$ emissions (the same
hemisphere with stronger shock expansion). We analyze in depth the
characteristics of electron-lepton-number (ELN) crossing by closely inspecting
the angular distributions of neutrinos in momentum space. The ELN crossing
happens in various ways, and the property depends on the radius: in the
vicinity of neutron star, $\bar{\nu}_{\rm e}$ ($\nu_{\rm e}$) dominates over
$\nu_{\rm e}$ ($\bar{\nu}_{\rm e}$) in the forward (backward) direction: at the
larger radius the ELN crossing occurs in the opposite way. We also find that
the non-radial ELN crossing occurs at the boundary between no ELN crossing and
the radial one, which is an effect of genuine multi-D transport. Our findings
indicate that the collective neutrino oscillation may occur more commonly in
CCSNe and suggest that the CCSN community needs to accommodate these
oscillations self-consistently in the modelling of CCSNe.

cross-domain model adaptation. Extensive experimental results show that our

Schwarzschild black hole. We obtain the point-like particle as a limit of a
spacetime describing a big neutral black hole with a small charged massive
object nearby. The massive object is modeled by a black hole or a naked
singularity. In this fully interacting system the massive object is supported
above the black hole by a strut. Such a strut has a non-zero tension which
corresponds to the external force compensating the gravitational force and the
electromagnetic self-force acting on the massive object. We discuss details of
the limiting procedure leading to the point-like particle situation. As a
result, we obtain the standard gravitational force in the static frame of the
Schwarzschild spacetime and the electromagnetic self-force. The
electromagnetic-self force differs slightly from the classical results in a
domain near the horizon. The difference is due to taking into account an
influence of the strut on the electromagnetic field. We also demonstrate that
higher order corrections to the gravitational force, a sort of the
gravitational self-force, are not uniquely defined and they depend on details
of the limiting procedure.

a low-rank decomposition to spatial and stochastic subspaces. Each of these
subspaces is represented by a set of orthonormal time-dependent modes. We
derive exact evolution equations of these time-dependent modes and the
evolution of the factorization of the reduced covariance matrix. We show that
DBO is equivalent to the dynamically orthogonal (DO) and bi-orthogonal (BO)
decompositions via linear and invertible transformation matrices that connect
DBO to DO and BO. However, DBO shows several improvements compared to DO and
BO: (i) DBO performs better than DO and BO for cases with ill-conditioned
covariance matrix; (ii) In contrast to BO, the issue of eigenvalue crossing is
not present in the DBO formulation; (iii) In contrast to DO, the stochastic
modes are orthonormal, which leads to more accurate representation of the
stochastic subspace. We study the convergence properties of the method and
compare it to the DO and BO methods. For demonstration, we consider three
cases: (i) stochastic linear advection equation, (ii) stochastic Burgers'
equation, and (iii) stochastic incompressible flow over a bump in a channel.
Overall we observe improvements in the numerical accuracy of DBO compared

required to evaluate the penalty function and its derivatives is solving a

storing a single factorization each iteration when the matrices are available

factorization-free algorithms by solving the linear system iteratively. The
penalty function therefore has promise when the linear system can be solved
efficiently, e.g., for PDE-constrained optimization problems where efficient
preconditioners exist. We discuss extensions including handling simple

unsupervised learning. They have achieved state-of-the-art performance in the
image domain. However, GANs are limited in two ways. They often learn
distributions with low support---a phenomenon known as mode collapse---and they
do not guarantee the existence of a probability density, which makes evaluating
generalization using predictive log-likelihood impossible. In this paper, we
develop the prescribed GAN (PresGAN) to address these shortcomings. PresGANs
add noise to the output of a density network and optimize an
entropy-regularized adversarial loss. The added noise renders tractable
approximations of the predictive log-likelihood and stabilizes the training
procedure. The entropy regularizer encourages PresGANs to capture all the modes
of the data distribution. Fitting PresGANs involves computing the intractable
gradients of the entropy regularization term; PresGANs sidestep this
intractability using unbiased stochastic estimates. We evaluate PresGANs on
several datasets and found they mitigate mode collapse and generate samples
with high perceptual quality. We further found that PresGANs reduce the gap in
performance in terms of predictive log-likelihood between traditional GANs and
variational autoencoders (VAEs).

observation associated with a solar type III radio burst on 24 December 1996.
This radio event was accompanied by high energy electrons, measured by the
Solid State Telescope (SST) on-board WIND spacecraft. The type III radio
emission started at $\approx$ 13:10~UT and was associated to a C2.1 GOES-class
flare whose maximum was at 13:11 UT and hosted by the active region NOAA
8007/8004, located on the west limb at N05$^\circ$ W74$^\circ$/N06$^\circ$
W85$^\circ$. During this event, the observation of an electron energy
distribution likely to be associated with the radio emission was registered.
The electrons arrive at the spacecraft predominantly from the anti-solar
direction, suggesting that their general motion is Sunward along a closed
magnetic field line. Leblanc et al. (1999) propose a model in which energetic
electrons are injected into a coronal flux tube at one of its footpoints,
releasing standard type-III emission. As the magnetic field then directs them
back toward the magnetic-conjugate footpoint of the first, the electrons
release subsequent emission whose radio profile is a quasi-time reversal of the
standard. We have constructed a cylindrical flux-rope facsimile of this
scenario that reproduces the U-burst profiles. We also report observational
features indicating a secondary electron energy distribution and propose a

attenuation to virtually decompose an object into specific constituent

enhance image contrast seen from weakly attenuating objects. In this paper, we
combine spectral phase contrast imaging with material decomposition to both
better visualise weakly attenuating features and separate them from overlying
objects in radiography. We derive an algorithm that performs both tasks
simultaneously and verify it against numerical simulations and experimental
measurements of ideal two-component samples composed of pure aluminium and
poly(methyl methacrylate). Additionally, we showcase first imaging results of a
rabbit kitten's lung. The attenuation signal of a thorax, in particular, is
dominated by the strongly attenuating bones of the ribcage, which combined with
the weak soft tissue signal make it difficult to visualise the fine anatomical
structures across the whole lung. In all cases, clean material decomposition
was achieved, without residual phase contrast effects, from which we generate
an un-obstructed image of the lung, free of bones. Spectral propagation-based
phase contrast imaging has the potential to be a valuable tool, not only in
future lung research, but also in other systems for which phase contrast
imaging in combination with material decomposition proves to be advantageous.

with isolated star-forming galaxies (<z>=0.28) with 9.4<log(M*/Msun)<10.9 and
with absorption detected within 200kpc. Galaxy ISM metallicities were measured
using Ha/[NII] emission lines from Keck/ESI spectra. CGM single-phase
low-ionization metallicities were modeled using MCMC and Cloudy analysis of
absorption from HST/COS and Keck/HIRES or VLT/UVES quasar spectra. We find that
the star-forming galaxy ISM metallicities follow the observed stellar mass
metallicity relation (scatter 0.19dex). CGM metallicity shows no dependence
with stellar mass and exhibits a scatter of ~2dex. All CGM metallicities are
lower than the galaxy ISM metallicities and are offset by log(dZ)=-1.17+/-0.11.
There is no obvious metallicity gradient as a function of impact parameter or
virial radius (<2.3 sigma). There is no relationship between the relative
CGM-galaxy metallicity and azimuthal angle. We find the mean metallicity
differences along the major and minor axes are -1.13+/-0.18 and -1.23+/-0.11,
respectively. Regardless of whether we examine our sample by low/high
inclination or low/high impact parameter, or low/high N(HI), we do not find any
significant relationship with relative CGM-galaxy metallicity and azimuthal
angle. We find that 10/15 low column density systems (logN(HI)<17.2) reside
along the galaxy major axis while high column density systems (logN(HI)>17.2)
reside along the minor axis. This suggest N(HI) could be a useful indicator of
accretion/outflows. We conclude that CGM is not well mixed, given the range of
galaxy-CGM metallicities, and that metallicity at low redshift might not be a
good tracer of CGM processes. Furthermore we should replace integrated
line-of-sight, single phase, metallicities with multi-phase, cloud-cloud
metallicities, which could be more indicative of the physical processes within
the CGM.

before 2018, and was brightened by about 1.0 magnitude in the W1 and W2 bands
within half a year and has been continuously brightening since then. No
significant variations are found in the optical photometry data during the same
period. This suggests that this MIR outburst is caused by recent replenishing
or redistribution of dust, rather than intrinsic variations of the WD. SED
modeling of 0145+234 suggests that there was already a dust disk around the WD
in the quiescent state, and both of the temperature and surface area of the
disk evolved rapidly since the outburst. The dust temperature was about 1770K
in the initial rising phase, close to the sublimation temperature of silicate
grains, and gradually cooled down to around 1150K, while the surface area
increased by a factor of about 6 during the same period. The inferred closest
distance of dust to the WD is within the tidal disruption radius of a
gravitationally bounded asteroid. We estimated the dust mass to be between
$3\times10^{15}$ to $3\times10^{17}$ $\rho/(1 \mathrm g~cm^{-3})$ kg for
silicate grains of a power-law size distribution with a high cutoff size from
0.1 to 1000 microns. We interpret this as a possible tidal breakup of an
exo-asteroid by the WD. Further follow-up observations of this rare event may

biases and pay close attention to their effects on CMB polarization which
previously have not been examined in detail. A potentially important bias that
we introduce here is $\textit{boost variance}$---an additional term in cosmic
variance, induced by the observer's motion. Although this additional term is
negligible for whole-sky experiments, in partial-sky experiments it can reach
$10\%$ (temperature) to $20\%$ (polarization) of the standard cosmic variance
($\sigma$). Furthermore, we investigate the significance of motion-induced
$\textit{power}$ and $\textit{parity}$ asymmetries in TT, EE, and TE as well as
potential biases induced in cosmological parameter estimation performed with
whole-sky TTTEEE. Using Planck-like simulations, we find that our local motion
induces $\sim1-2 \%$ hemispherical asymmetry in a wide range of angular scales
in the CMB temperature and polarization power spectra; however, it does not
imply any significant amount of parity asymmetry or shift in cosmological
parameters. Finally, we examine the prospects of measuring the velocity of the
Solar System w.r.t. the CMB with future experiments via the mode coupling
induced by the Doppler and aberration effects. Using the CMB TT, EE, and TE
power spectra up to $\ell=4000$, SO and CMB-S4 can make a dipole-independent

with a macroscopic population of photons and is realized in multiple settings

where the cavity mode is lossy due to the coupling to a Markovian environment
while the atomic mode is coupled to a colored bath. We analytically investigate
this model by inspecting its low-frequency behavior via the Schwinger-Keldysh
field theory and carefully examine the nature of the corresponding superradiant
phase transition. Integrating out the fast modes, we can identify a simple
effective theory allowing us to derive analytical expressions for various
critical exponents, including those, such as the dynamical critical exponent,
that have not been previously considered. We find excellent agreement with
previous numerical results when the non-Markovian bath is at zero temperature;
however, contrary to these studies, our low-frequency approach reveals that the
same exponents govern the critical behavior when the colored bath is at finite
temperature unless the chemical potential is zero. Furthermore, we show that
the superradiant phase transition is classical in nature, while it is genuinely
non-equilibrium. We derive a fractional Langevin equation and conjecture the
associated fractional Fokker-Planck equation that capture the system's
long-time memory as well as its non-equilibrium behavior. Finally, we consider
finite-size effects at the phase transition and identify the finite-size
scaling exponents, unlocking a rich behavior in both statics and dynamics of

distribution function (PDF) in the input space from that in the latent space.
If the embedding were isometric, this issue can be solved, because the relation
of PDFs can become tractable. To achieve isometric property, we propose Rate-
Distortion Optimization guided autoencoder inspired by orthonormal transform
coding. We show our method has the following properties: (i) the Jacobian
matrix between the input space and a Euclidean latent space forms a
constantlyscaled orthonormal system and enables isometric data embedding; (ii)
the relation of PDFs in both spaces can become tractable one such as
proportional relation. Furthermore, our method outperforms state-of-the-art

complex signals using standard auto-encoder for real numbers. The proposed

especially useful when these underlying properties do not have analytic models.
In addition, the proposed approach can achieve sparse support recovery with low
computational complexity. Experiments are conducted on an application ex-ample,

achieves significantly better performance with much less computation time than

satisfy the so-called approximate linearization property. The one-step

following sense: Globally for all vertices, it yields an asymptotic sum of
squares error no greater than those of the spectral methods, and locally for
each vertex, the asymptotic covariance matrix of the corresponding row of the
one-step estimator dominates those of the spectral embeddings in spectra. The
usefulness of the proposed one-step procedure is demonstrated via numerical

computational methods. Our focus is on self-organisation phenomena, and more
specifically on the time needed for the occurrence of pedestrian lanes, their
stability and their effect on the velocity-density relation. Moreover, we are
interested in understanding the amount of physical contact in the crowd. To
this end, we use a novel model considering the asymmetrical shape of the human
body and describing its rotation during collision avoidance, and combine it to
a mathematical model of group behaviour. We configure several scenarios by
varying the global density $\rho$ of pedestrians and the ratio $r_g$ describing
the percentage of grouped pedestrians in the simulation. Our results show that
the presence of groups has a significant effect on velocity and lane
organisation, and a dramatic one on collision. We are well aware of the
limitations of our approach, in particular concerning (i) the lack of
calibration of body rotation in collision avoidance on actual data and (ii)
straightforward application of a low density group model to higher density
settings. We nevertheless want to stress that it is not our intention to state
that our results reproduce the actual effect of groups on bi-directional flow.
In particular, it seems highly unrealistic that crowds with groups collide
extremely more often. Nevertheless we believe that our results show the great
theoretical and practical implication of the consideration of realistic group
behaviour in pedestrian models, and suggest that realistic results may hardly
be achieved simply by adding together modular models.

studied, assuming that the neutrons inside these stars are partially or totally
paired forming neutral vector bosons. The main effects of the magnetic field on
the gas are, first, to favor the phase transition to the Bose-Eintein
condensation, and second, to split the pressure in two components, one parallel
and the other perpendicular to the magnetic axis, giving rise to anisotropic
equations of state. At low densities or high magnetic fields, the lowest
pressure can be negative, and the boson system becomes susceptible to suffer a
transverse magnetic collapse. On the other hand, when the temperature is low
enough, the gas can spontaneously magnetize. The equations of state of the
magnetized gas of neutral vector bosons are applied, firstly, to study the
magnetic collpase of an ideal gas of neutrons, electrons and protons (npe gas)
in which the nucleons are partially bosonized. From the results obtained, a
model for the ejection of matter out of the star and the formation of
astrophysical jets is proposed. Subsequently, the equations of state of the
magnetized vector gas are used to study the magnetic field influence on the
structure (mass, radius and deformation) of Bose-Einsten condensate stars, that
is, of compact objects composed entirely by a neutron gas fully bosonized. In
order to appropriately take into account the magnetic anisotropy in the
equations of state of this object, we develope a system of equations to
describe the hydrodynamic equilibrium -- the structure -- of spheroidal compact
objects starting from an axisymmetric metric. The obtained results validate the

computationally-efficient and communication-efficient truthful mechanisms.

truthfulness, which we term implementation in advised strategies, and that has
been previously studied in relation to ""Implementation in Undominated

strategy either to that same strategy itself, or one that dominates it. We say
that a player follows advice as long as they never play actions which are
dominated by advice. A poly-time mechanism guarantees an $\alpha$-approximation
in implementation in advised strategies if there exists poly-time advice for
each player such that an $\alpha$-approximation is achieved whenever all
players follow advice. Using an appropriate bicriterion notion of approximate
demand queries (which can be computed in poly-time), we establish that (a

ISIS, and local insurgents, in six geographical areas identified via $k$-means
clustering applied to the Global Terrorism Database. All surveyed organizations
exhibit near-repeat activity whereby a prior attack increases the likelihood of
a subsequent one by the same group within 20km and on average 4 (al Qaeda) to
10 (ISIS) weeks. Near-response activity, whereby an attack by a given
organization elicits further attacks from a different one, is found to depend
on the adversarial, neutral or collaborative relationship between the two. When
in conflict, local insurgents respond quickly to attacks by global terror
groups while global terror groups delay their responses to local insurgents,
leading to an asymmetric dynamic. When neutral or allied, attacks by one group
enhance the response likelihood of the other, regardless of hierarchy. These
trends arise consistently in all clusters for which data is available.
Government intervention and spill-over effects are also discussed; we find no
evidence of outbidding. Understanding the regional dynamics of terrorism may be
greatly beneficial in policy-making and intervention design.

integrated signal called Multi-Scale Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (MS-NOMA)
for 5G positioning. One of the main differences between the MS-NOMA and the
traditional positioning signal is MS-NOMA supports configurable powers for
different positioning users (P-Users) to obtain better ranging accuracy and
signal coverage. Our major contributions are: Firstly, we present the MS-NOMA
signal and analyze the Bit Error Rate (BER) and ranging accuracy by deriving
their simple expressions. The results show the interaction between the
communication and positioning signals is rather limited, and it is feasible to
use the MS-NOMA signal to achieve high positioning accuracy. Secondly, for an
optimal positioning accuracy and signal coverage, we model the power allocation
problem for MS-NOMA signal as a convex optimization problem by satisfying the
QoS (Quality of Services) requirement and other constraints. Then, we propose a
novel Positioning-Communication Joint Power Allocation (PCJPA) algorithm which
allocates the powers of all P-Users iteratively. The theoretical and numerical
results show our proposed MS-NOMA signal has great improvements of
ranging/positioning accuracy than traditional PRS (Positioning Reference
Signal) in 5G, and improves the coverage dramatically which means more P-Users
could locate their positions without suffering the near-far effect.

significant increasing for lower (higher) branch and decreasing for higher

two-photon excitation is suppressed via quantum interference under optimal
phase and Rabi frequency of an external microwave field. It is shown that the
interplay between the quantum interference and the enhanced vacuum-Rabi

single photon source beyond strong atom-cavity coupling regime. In particular,
by tuning the optical Stark shift, the second-order correlation function for

Neural Network (DNN) modeled under a class of spike-and-slab priors. Given a

contraction rate is characterized that reveals a trade-off between the
variational error and the approximation error, which are both determined by the
network structural complexity (i.e., depth, width and sparsity). However, the
optimal network structure, which strikes the balance of the aforementioned
trade-off and yields the best rate, is generally unknown in reality. Therefore,
our work further develops an {\em adaptive} variational inference procedure
that can automatically select a reasonably good (data-dependent) network
structure that achieves the best contraction rate, without knowing the optimal
network structure. In particular, when the true function is H{\""o}lder smooth,
the adaptive variational inference is capable to attain (near-)optimal rate
without the knowledge of smoothness level. The above rate still suffers from
the curse of dimensionality, and thus motivates the teacher-student setup,
i.e., the true function is a sparse DNN model, under which the rate only
logarithmically depends on the input dimension.

However, no known implementation provides both fast query and construction

And Merged BloOm Filter) which is significantly faster in query time than
state-of-the-art genome indexing methods- COBS (Compact bit-sliced signature
index), Sequence Bloom Trees, HowDeSBT, and SSBT. Furthermore, it supports
insertion and query process parallelism, cheap updates for streaming inputs,
has a zero false-negative rate, a low false-positive rate, and a small index
size. RAMBO converts the search problem into set membership testing among $K$
documents. Interestingly, it is a count-min sketch type arrangement of a
membership testing utility (Bloom Filter in our case). The simplicity of the
algorithm and embarrassingly parallel architecture allows us to stream and
index a 170TB whole-genome sequence dataset in a mere 9 hours on a cluster of
100 nodes while competing methods require weeks.

pigeonhole. An efficiently pigeonhole class has a stronger property, involving
an efficiently-computable equivalence relation on subsets of the ground set. We

properties of superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems in the context of the
search for non-Abelian Majorana zero modes. We theoretically study the subband
occupation of semiconductor nanowire devices as function of the applied gate
potential, the semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) work function difference,
and the surface charge density by solving self-consistently the
Schr\""{o}dinger-Poisson equations for the conduction electrons of the

responsible for band bending, are shown to significantly increase the number of
occupied subbands, making it difficult or impossible to reach a regime where
only a few subbands are occupied. We also show that the energy separation
between subbands is significantly reduced in the regime of many occupied
subbands, with highly detrimental consequences for the realization and
observation of robust Majorana zero modes. As a consequence, the requirements
for the realization of robust topological superconductivity and Majorana zero
modes should include a low value of the chemical potential, consistent with the
occupation of only a few subbands. Finally, we show that the local density of
states on the exposed nanowire facets provides a powerful tool for identifying
a regime with many occupied subbands and is capable of providing additional
critical information regarding the feasibility of Majorana physics in

give the analytic expressions of the number of specific types of motifs and
calculate their correlated entropy. We conduct algebraic experiments on

was shown to be $O(n^2)$ times slower than randomized versions in the

faster convergence rates than the cyclic order, or even getting close to the

We show that both Gaussian back substitution (GBS) and symmetric Gauss-Seidel

to the SRG-evolved interaction. It turned out that the obtained in such a way

inversion in Be-11, i.e., the ground state in Be-11 has the spin-parity (1/2,
+) in experiments contrary to the expectation from the conventional shell model

Universe without invoking `dark' components, such as `dark matter' and `dark

departing from them at very low accelerations. Having in mind readers who are
historians and philosophers of science, as well as physicists and astronomers,
I describe in this review the main aspects of MOND -- its statement, its basic
tenets, its main predictions, and the tests of these predictions -- contrasting
it with the dark-matter paradigm. I then discuss possible wider ramifications
of MOND, for example the potential significance of the MOND constant, $a_0$,
with possible implications for the roots of MOND in cosmology. Along the way I
point to parallels with several historical instances of nascent paradigms. In
particular, with the emergence of the Copernican world picture, that of quantum
physics, and that of relativity, as regards their initial advent, their
development, their schematic structure, and their ramifications. For example,
the interplay between theories and their corollary laws, and the centrality of
a new constant with converging values as deduced from seemingly unrelated
manifestations of these laws. I demonstrate how MOND has already unearthed a
number of unsuspected laws of galactic dynamics (to which, indeed, $a_0$ is
central) predicting them a priori, and leading to their subsequent
verification. I parallel the struggle of the new with the old paradigms, and
the appearance of hybrid paradigms at such times of struggle. I also try to
identify in the history of those established paradigms a stage that can be
likened to that of MOND today.

Particle filters can track multi-targets and highly maneuvering targets.
However, it has higher computational load. The efficient use of particle

(IPPF) and tracking highly maneuvering targets using Multiple Model Particle
Filter(MMPF) are also explored in this work. These techniques require only
smaller number of particles and help in reducing the computational cost. Data

share rituals, we watch action movies, and we influence each other to believe
in the same causes. Human mind is packed with subjectivity because shared
cognitive biases bring us together. But they also make us vulnerable.
  An artificial mind is deemed to be more objective than the human mind. After
many years of science-fiction fantasies about even-minded androids, they are
now sold as personal or expert assistants, as brand advocates, as policy or
candidate supporters, as network influencers. Artificial agents have been
stunningly successful in disseminating artificial causal beliefs among humans.
As malicious artificial agents continue to manipulate human cognitive biases,
and deceive human communities into ostensive but expansive causal illusions,
the hope for defending us has been vested into developing benevolent artificial
agents, tasked with preventing and mitigating cognitive distortions inflicted

cognition be corrected on a more solid foundation of artificial causal
cognition?

solving the feasibility problem of finding a point in the intersection of

(DR). We prove local convergence of CRM in the same prototypical settings of
most theoretical analysis of regular nonconvex DR, whose consideration is made
natural by the geometry of the phase retrieval problem. For the purpose, we
show that CRM is related to the method of subgradient projections. For many
cases when DR is known to converge to a feasible point, we establish that CRM
locally provides a better convergence rate. As a root finder, we show that CRM
has local convergence whenever Newton--Raphson method does, has quadratic rate
whenever Newton--Raphson method does, and exhibits superlinear convergence in
many cases when Newton--Raphson method fails to converge at all. We also obtain
explicit regions of convergence. As an interesting aside, we demonstrate local
convergence of CRM to feasible points in cases when DR converges to fixed
points that are not feasible. We demonstrate an extension in higher dimensions,
and use it to obtain convergence rate guarantees for sphere and subspace
feasibility problems. Armed with these guarantees, we experimentally discover
that CRM is highly sensitive to compounding numerical error that may cause it
to achieve worse rates than those guaranteed by theory. We then introduce a
numerical modification that enables CRM to achieve the theoretically guaranteed
rates. Any future works that study CRM for product space formulations of
feasibility problems should take note of this sensitivity and account for it in
numerical implementations.

general, is a combination of a rotation and a reflection. It is possible to
apply such transformation due to a well-known property of First Order

0.8367*Tm for P < 0.017 GPa. (TLL) decreases with P < 0.017 GPa and disappears
for P > 0.55 GPa. The lowest-density liquid is, at once, the glacial phase of
fragile and high-density liquids. It is formed at TLL, remains liquid during
the first cooling, and gives rise to the glass phase by heating through a
first-order transition without latent heat at TK2 = 122.4 K. Ordered liquid
Phase 3 appears during the first heating above Tg = 137.1 K, with its own
Kauzmann temperature, superheating above Tm up to Tn+ if crystallization is
avoided. The latent heat at TLL exists during the first cooling and is
compensated during the next cooling by Phase 3 formation heat. The first-order
transition without latent heat at TK2 = 122.4 K induces ordered Phase 3,
becomes underlying below Tg in further heating and induces an enthalpy excess
at Tm which is used to predict TK2. This description agrees with the broken
bond and solid fractal structure percolation theories.

utilizes the self-attention mechanism to describe two-dimensional (2D) spatial
dependencies of characters in a scene text image. Exploiting the full-graph
propagation of self-attention, SATRN can recognize texts with arbitrary

existing STR models by a large margin of 5.7 pp on average in ""irregular text""

discrete process that models the spread of social contagion. Although the
burning process is a simple algorithm, the problem of determining the least
number of rounds needed to completely burn a graph, called the burning number
of the graph, is NP-complete even for elementary graph structures like spiders.
An early conjecture that every connected graph of order square of m can be
burned in at most m rounds is the main motivator of this study. Attempts to
prove the conjecture have resulted in various upper bounds for the burning
number and validation of the conjecture for certain elementary classes of
graphs. In this work, we find a tight upper bound for the order of a spider for
it to be burned within a given number of rounds. Our result shows that the
tight bound depends on the structure of the spider under consideration, namely
the number of arms. This strengthens the previously known results on spiders in
relation to the conjecture. More importantly, this opens up potential enquiry
into the connection between burning numbers and certain characteristics of
graphs. Finally, a tight upper bound for the order of a path forest for it to
be burned within a given number of rounds is obtained, thus completing
previously known partial corresponding results.

using terahertz spectroscopy. For the interaction between terahertz light and
the vibrational density of states of the fractal structure, we formulate an
infrared light-vibration coupling coefficient for the fracton region.
Accordingly, we show that information concerning fractal and fracton dimensions
appears in the exponent of the absorption coefficient. Finally, using terahertz
time-domain spectroscopy and low-frequency Raman scattering, we experimentally
observe these universal excitations in a protein lysozyme system that has an
intrinsically disordered and self-similar nature in a single supramolecule.
These findings are applicable to disordered and polymeric glasses in general

maximize the uplink common (minimum) throughput of the two IoT-devices over a

approached along the path pertinent to the Dirichlet b.c. then the leading term
describing the large-distance decay of thermal Casimir force between the walls
is 1/D^2 with a non-universal amplitude. The next order correction is lnD/D^3.
These observations remain in contrast with the decay law for both the periodic
and Neumann boundary conditions for which the leading term is 1/D^3 with a
universal amplitude. We associate this discrepancy with the non-zero
D-dependent positive value of the one-particle ground state energy in the case
of Dirichlet boundary conditions.

solutions prove that there is no thermal rectification. In the
ballistic-diffusive regime, the heat flux prefers to flow from the inner
boundary to the outer boundary. Furthermore, as the characteristic length (the
distance between two circular boundaries) increases from tens of nanometers to
tens of microns, the thermal rectification ratio enhances first and then fades
away gradually. It attributes to that as the direction of the temperature
gradient changes, the average phonon mean free path changes. The difference of
the average phonon mean free path finally leads to the change of the heat flux
or thermal conductivity. As the temperature decreases, the maximum thermal
rectification ratio decreases. In addition, as the radius ratio between the
inner and outer boundary increases, the thermal rectification ratio decreases
for a given characteristic length.

emergence of an interval in the spectral radius of the neural network in which
the prediction error is minimized. In a three-dimensional representation of the
error versus time and spectral radius, the interval corresponds to the bottom
region of a ""valley."" Such a valley arises for a variety of spatiotemporal

the interval tends to be larger for undirected than for directed networks. The
valley phenomenon can be beneficial to the design of optimal reservoir

Alice, the problem solver, unitarily computes the corresponding solution and
reads it by the final measurement. This simple extension creates a new
perspective from which to see the quantum algorithm. First, it highlights the
relevance of time-symmetric quantum mechanics to quantum computation: the
problem-setting and problem solution, in their quantum version, constitute pre-

both boundary conditions. Second, it forces us to enter into relational quantum

to Bob, and another one with respect to Alice, from whom the outcome of the
initial measurement, specifying the setting and thus the solution of the

into account both boundary conditions leaves the representation to Bob
unaltered. It shows that the representation to Alice is a sum over histories in
each of which she remains shielded from the information coming to her from the
initial measurement, not from that coming to her backwards in time from the
final measurement. In retrospect, all is as if she knew in advance, before
performing her problem-solving action, half of the information that specifies
the solution of the problem she will read in the future and could use this

VoIP-based steganography methods have emerged in recent years, which poses a
great threat to the security of cyberspace. Low bit-rate speech codecs are
widely used in the VoIP application due to its powerful compression capability.
QIM steganography makes it possible to hide secret information in VoIP streams.
Previous research mostly focus on capturing the inter-frame correlation or
inner-frame correlation features in code-words but ignore the hierarchical
structure which exists in speech frame. In this paper, motivated by the complex
multi-scale structure, we design a Hierarchical Representation Network to
tackle the steganalysis of QIM steganography in low-bit-rate speech signal. In
the proposed model, Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is used to model the
hierarchical structure in the speech frame, and three level of attention
mechanisms are applied at different convolution block, enabling it to attend
differentially to more and less important content in speech frame. Experiments
demonstrated that the steganalysis performance of the proposed method can
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods especially in detecting both short and
low embeded speech samples. Moreover, our model needs less computation and has
higher time efficiency to be applied to real online services.

of dust falling into the black hole. Using the former method, the first and
second laws of thermodynamics are always satisfied in the normal phase space,
while in the extended phase space, the first law of thermodynamics is also
satisfied, but the validity of the second law of thermodynamics depends on the

attributed to the assumption that the change of internal energy of the black

important information from the high-dimensional data by mapping the data to a
low-dimensional subspace. Furthermore, for the diversity of varied

Preserve Projection. Firstly, we construct a single view DR method named Smooth
Preserve Projection based on the Smooth Representation model. The proposed
method aims to find a subspace for the high-dimensional data, in which the
smooth reconstructive weights are preserved as much as possible. Then, we
extend it to a multi-view version in which we exploits Hilbert-Schmidt

recent advent of the ALMA interferometer. More specifically, the unprecedented
combination of high-sensitivity and high-angular resolution provided by ALMA
allows one to shed light on the jet/disk systems associated with a Sun-like
mass protostar. Also astrochemistry enjoyed the possibility to analyze complex
spectra obtained using large bandwidths: several interstellar Complex Organic
Molecules (iCOMs; C-bearing species with at least 6 atoms) have been imaged
around protostars. This in turn boosted the study of the astrochemistry at work
during the earliest phases of star formation paving the way to the chemical
complexity in planetary systems where Life could emerge. There is mounting
evidence that the observations of iCOMs can be used as unique tool to shed
light, on Solar System scales (< 50 au), on the molecular content of
protostellar disk. The increase of iCOMs abundances occur only under very
selective physical conditions, such as those associated low-velocity shocks
found where the infalling envelope is impacting the rotating accretion disk.
The imaging of these regions with simpler molecules such as CO or CS is indeed
paradoxically hampered by their high abundances and consequently high line
opacities which do not allow the observers to disentangle all the emitting
components at these small scales. In this respect, we review the state-of-the
art of the ALMA analysis about the standard Sun-like star forming region in
Orion named HH 212. We show (i) how all the physical components involved in the
formation of a Sun-like star can be revealed only by observing different
molecular tracers, and (ii) how the observation of iCOMs emission, observed to
infer the chemical composition of star forming regions, can be used also as
unique tracer to image protostellar disks on Solar System scales.

autoencoder and time-series-based anomaly detection to reconstruct the driving

effectiveness of different variants of SelfOracle at predicting injected

This is by now about three orders of magnitude below what standard saturation
mechanisms in neutron stars could provide, which requires very strong
dissipation in the interior, strongly pointing towards a structurally complex

even be outside of the instability region, and taking into account the various

long-horizon problems with sparse and delayed rewards. Many existing HRL
algorithms either use pre-trained low-level skills that are unadaptable, or
require domain-specific information to define low-level rewards. In this paper,
we aim to adapt low-level skills to downstream tasks while maintaining the
generality of reward design. We propose an HRL framework which sets auxiliary
rewards for low-level skill training based on the advantage function of the
high-level policy. This auxiliary reward enables efficient, simultaneous
learning of the high-level policy and low-level skills without using
task-specific knowledge. In addition, we also theoretically prove that
optimizing low-level skills with this auxiliary reward will increase the task
return for the joint policy. Experimental results show that our algorithm
dramatically outperforms other state-of-the-art HRL methods in Mujoco domains.
We also find both low-level and high-level policies trained by our algorithm
transferable.

the emission of gravitational waves. This can happen if their mass distribution
is sufficiently non-axisymmetric. It has been suggested that such `mountains'
may be created via temperature non-axisymmetries, but estimates of the likely
level of temperature asymmetry have been lacking. To remedy this, we examine a
simple symmetry breaking mechanism, where an internal magnetic field perturbs
the thermal conductivity tensor, making it direction-dependent. We find that
the internal magnetic field strengths required to build mountains of the
necessary size are very large, several orders of magnitude larger than the
inferred external field strengths, pushing into the regime where our assumption
of the magnetic field having a perturbative effect on the thermal conductivity
breaks down. We also examine how non-axisymmetric surface temperature profiles,
as might be caused by magnetic funnelling of the accretion flow, lead to
internal temperature asymmetries, but find that for realistic parameters the
induced non-axisymmetries are very small. We conclude that, in the context of
this work at least, very large internal magnetic fields are required to
generate mountains of the necessary size.

corresponding distributions over constant energy hypersurfaces (weighted by the
Liouville measure) as a power-law in time. Moreover, trajectories emanating

over constant energy hypersurfaces show interesting phase transitions from
Wignerian to bimodal with increasing energy. Finally, in the band of global

submerged in hot oil, after some critical time increases its buoyancy and
floats to the surface. The lift-off time is a useful metric in ensuring that
the snacks are properly cooked. Here we propose a multiphase mathematical model
for the frying of potato snacks, where water inside the dough is evaporated
from both the top and bottom surfaces of the snack at two receding evaporation
fronts. The vapour created at the top of the snack bubbles away to the surface,
whereas the vapour released from the bottom surface forms a buoyant blanket
layer. By asymptotic analysis, we show that the model simplifies to solving a
one-dimensional Stefan problem in the snack coupled to a thin-film equation in
the vapour blanket through a non-linear boundary condition. Using our
mathematical model, we predict the change in the snack density as a function of
time, and investigate how lift-off time depends on the different parameters of
the problem.

namely \textit{tree metrics} for a space of supports of each probability

\textit{flows} from a root to each support instead of pair-wise tree metrics of
supports, i.e., flows from a support to another, in GW. Consequently, we
propose a novel discrepancy, named Flow-based Alignment (\FlowAlign), by
matching the flows of the probability measures. We show that \FlowAlign~shares
a similar structure as a univariate optimal transport distance. Therefore,
\FlowAlign~is fast for computation and scalable for large-scale applications.
By further exploring tree structures, we propose a variant of \FlowAlign, named
Depth-based Alignment (\DepthAlign), by aligning the flows hierarchically along
each depth level of the tree structures. Theoretically, we prove that both
\FlowAlign~and \DepthAlign~are pseudo-distances. Moreover, we also derive

and Electroencephalogram (EEG), oscillations emerge as a result of neural
network activity. The oscillations extend over several frequency bands. Between
their dominant components, various couplings can be observed. Of these,
Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) is intensively studied in relation to brain
function. In the time-frequency domain, however, PAC measurement faces a
dilemma in the choice of filter bandwidth. For a frequency m modulating a
frequency n, filters narrowly tuned around the latter frequency will miss the
modulatory components at frequencies n+m and n-m; wide band tuning will pass
increasing levels of noise. New Method: Our CFC measurement uses three
identical narrow band filters with center frequencies located on n-m, n, and
n+m. The method therefore is free from the bandwidth dilemma. Comparison with
Existing Method(s): The method was tested on diagnostic artificial signals
modeled on local field potentials and compared with four established PAC
detection algorithms. While the proposed method detected the simulated PAC in
high frequency resolution, the other methods detected with poor frequency
resolution, or completely missed the PAC. Conclusion: Using the proposed
triplet-filter banks instead of wideband filtering allows for high resolution
detection of PAC. Moreover, the method successfully detected PAC in wide range
of modulation frequency. Finally, bandwidth is not chosen subjectively in our
new method which makes the comparison of PAC more convenient among different
studies.

set of nodes. Clearly, a multilayer description of a system adds value only if
the multiplex does not merely consist of independent layers, i.e. if the
inter-layer overlap is nontrivial. On real-world multiplexes, it is expected
that the observed overlap may partly result from spurious correlations arising
from the heterogeneity of nodes and partly from true interdependencies.
However, no rigorous way to disentangle these two effects has been developed.
In this paper we introduce an unbiased maximum-entropy model of multiplexes
with controllable node degrees and controllable overlap. The model can be
mapped to a generalized Ising model where the combination of node heterogeneity
and inter-layer coupling leads to the possibility of local phase transitions.
In particular, we find that an increased heterogeneity in the network results
in different critical points for different pairs of nodes, which in turn leads
to local phase transitions that may ultimately increase the overlap. The model
allows us to quantify how the overlap can be increased by either increasing the
heterogeneity of the network (spurious correlation) or the strength of the
inter-layer coupling (true correlation), thereby disentangling the two effects.
As an application, we show that the empirical overlap in the International
Trade Multiplex is not merely a spurious result of the correlation between node
degrees across different layers, but requires a non-zero inter-layer coupling
in its modeling.

Typhoon Talims passage northeast of the array one day ahead of the cyclones
closest approach when the cyclones eye was more than 1,000 km away. For 10
days, a group of near-inertial motions appeared most clearly in temperature.
The registration reflects the importance of barotropic response to cyclones and
the propagation of inertio-gravity waves in weak density stratification. In
addition to internal tides, these waves drove turbulent overturns larger than
200 m that were concurrently registered by OBSs. The turbulent signals were
neither due to seismic activity nor to ocean-surface wave action. Cyclones can
generate not only microseisms and earth hums, as well as turbulence in the
water column, producing additional ground motions. Quantified turbulence
processes may help constrain models on sediment resuspension and its effect on
deep-sea benthic life.

diseases such as cancer. However, it is challenging to train CNN on whole slide
images (WSIs) of gigapixel resolution considering the available memory
capacity. Most of the previous works divide high resolution WSIs into small
image patches and separately input them into the model to classify it as a
tumor or a normal tissue. However, patch-based classification uses only
patch-scale local information but ignores the relationship between neighboring
patches. If we consider the relationship of neighboring patches and global
features, we can improve the classification performance. In this paper, we
propose a new model structure combining the patch-based classification model
and whole slide-scale segmentation model in order to improve the prediction
performance of automatic pathological diagnosis. We extract patch features from
the classification model and input them into the segmentation model to obtain a
whole slide tumor probability heatmap. The classification model considers
patch-scale local features, and the segmentation model can take global
information into account. We also propose a new optimization method that
retains gradient information and trains the model partially for end-to-end
learning with limited GPU memory capacity. We apply our method to the
tumor/normal prediction on WSIs and the classification performance is improved

time (AFT) models have been widely used in different applications of survival

lifetime data with crossing survival curves. In 2005, Yang and Prentice
proposed a semiparametric two-sample strategy (YP model), including the PH and
PO frameworks as particular cases, to deal with this type of data. Assuming a
general regression setting, the present paper proposes an unified approach to
fit the YP model by employing Bernstein polynomials to manage the baseline
hazard and odds under both the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. The use of
the Bernstein polynomials has some advantages: it allows for uniform
approximation of the baseline distribution, it leads to closed-form expressions
for all baseline functions, it simplifies the inference procedure, and the
presence of a continuous survival function allows a more accurate estimation of
the crossing survival time. Extensive simulation studies are carried out to
evaluate the behavior of the models. The analysis of a clinical trial data set,
related to non-small-cell lung cancer, is also developed as an illustration.
Our findings indicate that assuming the usual PH model, ignoring the existing
crossing survival feature in the real data, is a serious mistake with
implications for those patients in the initial stage of treatment.

challenge in the fields of quantum communication, imaging and nanophotonics. In
particular, high-dimensional quantum states of light enable quantum networks

compared with qubits. However, although qubit entanglement has been distributed
over large distances through free space and fibre, the transport of
high-dimensional entanglement is hindered by the complexity of the channel,
which encompasses effects such as free-space turbulence or mode mixing in
multimode waveguides. Here, we demonstrate the transport of six-dimensional
spatial-mode entanglement through a 2-m-long, commercial multimode fibre with
84.4% fidelity. We show how the entanglement can itself be used to measure the
transmission matrix of the complex medium, allowing the recovery of quantum
correlations that were initially lost. Using a unique property of entangled
states, the medium is rendered transparent to entanglement by carefully
'scrambling' the photon that did not enter it, rather than unscrambling the
photon that did. Our work overcomes a primary challenge in the fields of
quantum communication and imaging, and opens a new pathway towards the control
of complex scattering processes in the quantum regime.

As in a previous four-flavor study, for small values of the inverse gauge

pattern of a Gaussian symplectic chiral random-matrix ensemble (GSE) with Dyson
index $\beta_D=4$, which corresponds to any-color QCD with adjoint quarks in
the continuum instead of QC$_2$D wih fundamental quarks. We show that this
unphysical behavior occurs only inside of the bulk phase of $SU(2)$ gauge
theory, where the density of $Z_2$ monopoles is high. Using an improved gauge
action and a somewhat larger inverse coupling to suppress these monopoles, we
demonstrate that the continuum Goldstone spectrum of two-color QCD,
corresponding to a Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) with Dyson index
$\beta_D=1$, is recovered also with rooted-staggered quarks once simulations
are performed away from the bulk phase. We further demonstrate how this change
of random-matrix ensemble is reflected in the distribution of eigenvalues of
the Dirac operator. By computing the unfolded level spacings inside and outside
of the bulk phase, we demonstrate that, starting with the low-lying eigenmodes
which determine the infrared physics, the distribution of eigenmodes
continuously changes from the GSE to the GOE one as monopoles are suppressed.

from sequential data while paying attention to different subsequences, e.g.,
word-pieces or syllables in a spoken word. From the subsequences, it retrieves
richer information than a single-head attention which only summarizes the whole
sequence into one context vector. However, a naive use of the multi-head
attention does not guarantee such richness as the attention heads may have
positional and representational redundancy. In this paper, we propose a
regularization technique for multi-head attention mechanism in an end-to-end
neural keyword spotting system. Augmenting regularization terms which penalize
positional and contextual non-orthogonality between the attention heads
encourages to output different representations from separate subsequences,
which in turn enables leveraging structured information without explicit
sequence models such as hidden Markov models. In addition, intra-head
contextual non-orthogonality regularization encourages each attention head to
have similar representations across keyword examples, which helps
classification by reducing feature variability. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed regularization technique significantly improves
the keyword spotting performance for the keyword ""Hey Snapdragon"".

find that the boundary spins are pinned to a certain value and at special
values of the interaction anisotropy, the steady states are formed by a rank-2
mixture of helical states with opposite winding numbers. Contrarily to previous
stabilization of topological states, these helical states are not protected by
a gap in the spectrum of the Lindbladian. By changing the anisotropy, the
transition between these steady states takes place via mixed states of higher
rank. In particular, crossing the value of zero anisotropy a totally mixed
state is found as the steady state. The transition between the different
winding numbers via mixed states can be seen in the light of the transitions
between different topological states in dissipatively driven systems. The
results are obtained developing a perturbation theory in the inverse
dissipative coupling strength and using the numerical exact diagonalization and

very small scales at different redshifts. The cases where the two quasar
components are gravitationally bound, known as physical binary quasars, can
also exhibit enhanced astrophysical activity and therefore are of particular
scientific interest. Here we present the serendipitous discovery of a physical
pair of quasars with an angular separation of $\Delta\theta = (8.76 \pm 0.11)$
arcsec. The redshifts of the two quasars are consistent within the errors and
measured as $z = (1.76\pm 0.01)$. Under the motivated assumption that the pair
does not arise from a single gravitationally lensed quasar, the resulting
projected physical separation was estimated as $(76 \pm 1)$ kpc. For both
targets we detected Si VI, C VI, C III], and Mg II emission lines. However, the
two quasars show significantly different optical colours, one being among the
most reddened quasars at $z > 1.5$ and the other with colours consistent with
typical quasar colours at the same redshift. Therefore it is ruled out that the
sources are a lensed system. This is our second serendipitous discovery of a
pair of two quasars with different colours, having a separation $\lesssim 10$
arcsec, which extends the very limited catalogue of known quasar pairs. We
ultimately argue that the number of binary quasars may have been significantly
underestimated in previous photometric surveys, due to the bias arising from
paired quasars with very different colours.

neural network structure is proposed for forecasting electricity prices and
local inflow to water reservoirs. The resulting forecasters generate
predictions with seasonal variation without relying on long input sequences.
This forecasting method is employed in a stochastic program formulation of the
day-ahead problem. This results in optimal order strategies for a price-taking
hydropower producer participating in the Nordic day-ahead market. Using an
open-source software framework for stochastic programming, the model is
implemented and distributed over multiple cores. The model is then solved in
parallel using a sampling-based algorithm. Tight confidence intervals around
the stochastic solution are provided, which show that the gain from adopting a
stochastic approach is statistically significant.

We find that XRFs and XRRs have more bright X-ray flares than C-GRBs. The ratio

several fraudulent orders to maximize their gain is referred to as organized
fraud. Existing approaches to fraud detection typically analyze orders in

linked to organized fraud. These also wrongly identify many legitimate orders
as fraud, which hinders their usage for automated fraud cancellation. We
introduce a novel solution to detect organized fraud by analyzing orders in

orders placed by the same group of fraudsters. It selectively uses two existing
techniques, agglomerative clustering and sampling to recursively group orders
into small clusters in a reasonable amount of time. We assess our clustering
technique on real-world orders placed on the Zalando website, the largest
online apparel retailer in Europe1. Our clustering processes 100,000s of orders

has been suggested that Martian obliquity cycles might cause periodic collapses

would then build up in the subsurface, potentially affecting present-day heat
flow - and thus the measurements made by a heat-flow probe such as the InSight
HP$^{3}$ instrument. To gauge the order of magnitude of this effect, we model
the diffusion of a putative heat pulse caused by thermal conductivity changes
with a simple numerical scheme and compare it to the heat-flow perturbations
caused by other effects. We find that an atmospheric collapse to 300 Pa in the
last 40 kyr would lead to a present-day heat flow that is up to $2-8\%$ larger

expected $5-15\%$ error bars on the HP$^{3}$ measurement, this perturbation

sample-by-sample method yields the correct mean-field value for the critical
exponent $\nu$ related to the divergence of the correlation length, while it
does not predict the correct qualitative behavior of $\nu$ below the upper
critical dimension. On the other hand, the ERG procedure has been claimed to
predict the correct behavior of $\nu$ both above and below the upper critical
dimension. Here, we straighten out the reasons for the discrepancy between the
two methods above, by demonstrating that the ERG method predicts a marginally
stable critical fixed point, thus implying a prediction for the critical
exponent $\nu$ given by $2^{1/\nu} = 1$. This prediction disagrees, on a
qualitative and quantitative level, both with the mean-field value of $\nu$
above the critical dimension, and with numerical estimates of $\nu$ below the
upper critical dimension. Therefore, our results show that finding a real-space

dynamic edges represented by causal linear transfer functions. The major
question addressed in this paper is where to allocate external excitation
signals such that a network model set becomes generically identifiable when
measuring all vertex signals. To tackle this synthesis problem, a novel graph
structure, referred to as \textit{directed pseudotree}, is introduced, and the
generic identifiability of a network model set can be featured by a set of
disjoint directed pseudotrees that cover all the parameterized edges of an
\textit{extended graph}, which includes the correlation structure of the
process noises. Thereby, an algorithmic procedure is devised, aiming to
decompose the extended graph into a minimal number of disjoint pseudotrees,
whose roots then provide the appropriate locations for excitation signals.
Furthermore, the proposed approach can be adapted using the notion of
\textit{anti-pseudotrees} to solve a dual problem, that is to select a minimal
number of measurement signals for generic identifiability of the overall
network, under the assumption that all the vertices are excited.

passive mechanisms for enhanced diffusion and chemotaxis, in the sense that
they require only binding and unbinding of the enzyme to the substrate rather
than the catalytic reaction itself. These mechanisms rely on conformational
changes of the enzyme due to binding, as well as on phoresis due to non-contact
interactions between enzyme and substrate. Here, after reviewing and
generalizing our previous findings, we extend them in two different ways. In
the case of enhanced diffusion, we show that an exact result for the long-time
diffusion coefficient of the enzyme can be obtained using generalized Taylor
dispersion theory, which results in much simpler and transparent analytical
expressions for the diffusion enhancement. In the case of chemotaxis, we show
that the competition between phoresis and binding-induced changes in diffusion
results in non-trivial steady state distributions for the enzyme, which can
either accumulate in or be depleted from regions with a specific substrate

three-family $N=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models in Type IIA orientifolds on
${\bf T}^6/(\mathbb Z_2\times \mathbb Z_2)$ with intersecting D6-branes.
Arising from the stacks of D6-branes with $U(n)$ gauge symmetries, the
Pati-Salam gauge symmetries $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ can be
broken down to the Standard Model via D-brane splitting as well as D- and
F-flatness preserving Higgs mechanism. Also, the hidden sector contains
$USp(n)$ branes, which are parallel with the orientifold planes or their
${\mathbb Z_2}$ images. We find that the Type II T-duality in the previous
study is not an equivalent relation in Pati-Salam model building if the model
is not invariant under $SU(2)_L$ and $SU(2)_R$ exchange, and provides a way to
obtain new models. We systematically construct the new models with three
families, which usually do not have gauge coupling unification at the string
scale. We for the first time construct the Pati-Salam models with one wrapping
number equal to $5$. In particular, we find that these models carry more
refined gauge couplings, and thus with more possibility to have approximate
gauge coupling unification.

area of video surveillance. To predict the existence of a particular attribute,
it is demanded to localize the regions related to the attribute. However, in
this task, the region annotations are not available. How to carve out these
attribute-related regions remains challenging. Existing methods applied
attribute-agnostic visual attention or heuristic body-part localization
mechanisms to enhance the local feature representations, while neglecting to
employ attributes to define local feature areas. We propose a flexible
Attribute Localization Module (ALM) to adaptively discover the most
discriminative regions and learns the regional features for each attribute at
multiple levels. Moreover, a feature pyramid architecture is also introduced to
enhance the attribute-specific localization at low-levels with high-level
semantic guidance. The proposed framework does not require additional region
annotations and can be trained end-to-end with multi-level deep supervision.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
results on three pedestrian attribute datasets, including PETA, RAP, and
PA-100K.

planet evolution processes, including atmospheric loss, orbital migration, and
radiative cooling. V1298 Tau, a young solar analog with an age of 23 $\pm$ 4
Myr, is one such laboratory. The star is already known to host a Jupiter-sized
planet on a 24 day orbit. Here, we report the discovery of three additional
planets --- all between the size of Neptune and Saturn --- based on our
analysis of K2 Campaign 4 photometry. Planets c and d have sizes of 5.6 and 6.4
$R_\oplus$, respectively and with orbital periods of 8.25 and 12.40 days reside
0.25% outside of the nominal 3:2 mean-motion resonance. Planet e is 8.7
$R_\oplus$ in size but only transited once in the K2 time series and thus has a
period longer than 36 days, but likely shorter than 223 days. The V1298 Tau
system may be a precursor to the compact multiplanet systems found to be common
by the Kepler mission. However, the large planet sizes stand in sharp contrast
to the vast majority of Kepler multis which have planets smaller than 3
$R_\oplus$. Simple dynamical arguments suggest total masses of $<$28 $M_\oplus$
and $<$120 $M_\oplus$ for the c-d and d-b planet pairs, respectively. The
implied low masses suggest that the planets may still be radiatively cooling
and contracting, and perhaps losing atmosphere. The V1298 Tau system offers
rich prospects for further follow-up including atmospheric characterization by
transmission or eclipse spectroscopy, dynamical characterization through
transit-timing variations, and measurements of planet masses and obliquities by
radial velocities.

higher-multipoles of GW signals from any single, isolated merger event is
challenging, as there is much less power in comparison to the dominant

combining multiple events observed in interferometric gravitational wave

separate events are stacked using time-frequency spectrogram of the data. We
demonstrate that this procedure enhances the signal-to-noise ratio of the

$\sim 100$ events observed in two-detector coincidence can lead to the
detection of the higher-multipole components with a $\geq$ 95\% detection

binary black hole merger events within a month of operation at design

here we proposed a possible theoretical explanation to describe connection

Our robotic exploration experiments show that the grid firing firstly is
determined by local environment cues, and after self-correction with
experience-dependence, the regular, continuous grid firing patterns tessellate
the explored space. Head direction (HD) cells also show global patterns in our

a universal spatial metric for mammalian spatial navigation in complex

generates a smooth, feasible trajectory for the duration of the planning
horizon. These planners, however, are typically developed separately, and
changes in the behavior planner might affect the trajectory planner in

jointly learnable behavior and trajectory planner. Unlike most existing
learnable motion planners that address either only behavior planning, or use an

that learns a shared cost function employed by our behavior and trajectory

jointly learned planner performs significantly better in terms of both

sparse place firing generates in the dentate gyrus can help animals to break
the perception ambiguity during environment exploration, we build a
biologically relevant, computational model from grid cells to place cells. The
weight from grid cells to dentate gyrus granule cells is learned by competitive
Hebbian learning. We resorted to the robot system for demonstrating our
cognitive mapping model on the KITTI odometry benchmark dataset. The
experimental results show that our model is able to stably, robustly build a
coherent semi-metric topological map in the large-scale outdoor environment.
The experimental results suggest that the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit as a
variant locality-sensitive hashing algorithm is capable of generating sparse
encoding for easily distinguishing different locations in the environment. Our
experiments also provide theoretical supports that this analogous hashing
algorithm may be a general principle of computation in different brain regions
and species.

Kinetic plasma simulations are nowadays commonly used to study a
wealth of non-linear behaviours and properties in laboratory and space plasmas.
In particular, in high-energy physics and astrophysics, the plasma usually
evolves in ultra-strong electromagnetic fields produced by intense laser beams
for the former or by rotating compact objects such as neutron stars and black
holes for the latter. In these ultra-strong electromagnetic fields, the
gyro-period is several orders of magnitude smaller than the timescale on which
we desire to investigate the plasma evolution. Some approximations are required
like for instance artificially decreasing the electromagnetic field strength
which is certainly not satisfactory. The main flaw of this downscaling is that
it cannot reproduce particle acceleration to ultra-relativistic speeds with
Lorentz factor above $\gamma \approx 10^3-10^4$. In this paper, we design a new
algorithm able to catch particle motion and acceleration to Lorentz factor up
to $10^{15}$ or even higher by using Lorentz boosts to special frames where the
electric and magnetic field are parallel. Assuming that these fields are
locally uniform in space and constant in time, we solve analytically the
equation of motion in a tiny region smaller than the length scale of the
spatial and temporal gradient of the field.

2008bm, SN 2009aj, and SN 2009au. These SNe display the following common
characteristics: signs of early interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar
material (CSM), blue $B\!-\!V$ colours, weakness of metal lines, low expansion
velocities, and $V$-band absolute magnitudes 2-3 mag brighter than those
expected for normal SNe II based on their expansion velocities. Two more SNe
reported in the literature (SN 1983K and LSQ13fn) share properties similar to
our sample. Analysing this set of five SNe II, which are luminous for their low
expansion velocities (LLEV), we find that their properties can be reproduced
assuming ejecta-CSM interaction that lasts between 4-11 weeks post explosion.
The contribution of this interaction to the radiation field seems to be the
dominant component determining the observed weakness of metal lines in the
spectra rather than the progenitor metallicity. Based on hydrodynamic
simulations, we find that the interaction of the ejecta with a CSM of ~3.6
M$_\odot$ can reproduce the light curves and expansion velocities of SN 2009aj.
Using data collected by the Chilean Automatic Supernova Search, we estimate an
upper limit for the LLEV SNe II fraction to be 2-4 per cent of all normal SNe
II. With the current data-set, it is not clear whether the LLEV events are a
separated class of SNe II with a different progenitor system, or whether they
are the extreme of a continuum mediated by CSM interaction with the rest of the
normal SN II population.

Dusty Gas Rich Sources' (BADGRS) they have cold diffuse dust temperatures, and
the highest dust-to-stellar mass ratios of any galaxies in the local Universe.
Here, we explore the molecular ISM in a representative sample of BADGRS, using
very deep CO(J_up=1,2,3) observations across the central and outer disk
regions. We find very low CO brightnesses (Tp=15-30 mK), despite the bright
far-infrared emission and metallicities in the range 0.5<Z/Z_sun<1.0. The CO
line ratios indicate a range of conditions with R_21=0.6-2.1 and R_31=0.2-1.2.
Using a metallicity dependent conversion from CO luminosity to molecular gas
mass we find M_H2/M_d=7-27 and Sigma_H2=0.5-6 M_sun pc^-2, around an order of
magnitude lower than expected. The BADGRS have lower molecular gas depletion
timescales (tau_d = 0.5 Gyr) than other local spirals, lying offset from the
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation by a similar factor to Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies.
The cold diffuse dust temperatures in BADGRS (13-16 K) require an interstellar
radiation field 10-20 times lower than that inferred from their observed
surface brightness. We speculate that the dust in these sources has either a
very clumpy geometry or a very different opacity in order to explain the cold
temperatures and lack of CO emission. BADGRS also have low UV attenuation for
their UV colour suggestive of an SMC-type dust attenuation curve, different
star formation histories or different dust/star geometry. They lie in a similar
part of the IRX-beta space as z=5 galaxies and may be useful as local analogues
for high gas fraction galaxies in the early Universe.

Traditional exploration of the optimal synthesis conditions of novel materials

population. By construction, the sample boasts a unique degree of homogeneity
in terms of optical/UV properties. In the X-rays, only four sources are too
faint for a detailed spectral analysis. Neglecting a radio-loud object, the
other 25 quasars are, as a whole, the most X-ray luminous ever observed, with
rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosities of $0.5-7\times10^{45}$ erg/s. The continuum
photon index distribution, centred at $\Gamma\sim1.85$, is in excellent
agreement with those in place at lower redshift, luminosity and black-hole
mass, confirming the universal nature of the X-ray emission mechanism in
quasars. Even so, when compared against the well-known $L_{\rm X}-L_{\rm UV}$
correlation, our quasars unexpectedly split into two distinct subsets. About
2/3 of the sources are clustered around the relation with a minimal scatter of
0.1 dex, while the remaining 1/3 appear to be X-ray underluminous by factors of
$>3-10$. Such a large incidence ($\approx25\%$) of X-ray weakness has never
been reported in radio-quiet, non-BAL quasar samples. Several factors could
contribute to enhance the X-ray weakness fraction among our $z\simeq3$ blue
quasars. However, the X-ray weak objects also have, on average, flatter
spectra, with no clear evidence of absorption. Indeed, column densities in
excess of a few $\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ can be ruled out for most of the
sample. We suggest that, at least in some of our X-ray weak quasars, the corona
might experience a radiatively inefficient phase due to the presence of a
powerful accretion-disc wind, which substantially reduces the accretion rate
through the inner disc and so the availability of seed photons for Compton
up-scattering.

operate as optical quantum emitters that overcome current limitations of
conventional bulk emitters, such as yielding a high single-photon generation
rate and offering surface accessibility for excitation and photon extraction.
Here we demonstrate electrically stimulated photon emission from individual
point defects in a 2D material. Specifically, by bringing a metallic tip into
close proximity to a discrete defect state in the band gap of WS2, we induce
inelastic tip-to-defect electron tunneling with an excess of transition energy
carried by the emitted photons. We gain atomic spatial control over the
emission through the position of the tip, while the spectral characteristics
are highly customizable by varying the applied tip-sample voltage. Atomically
resolved emission maps of individual sulfur vacancies and chromium substituent
defects are in excellent agreement with the electron density of their
respective defect orbitals as imaged via conventional elastic scanning
tunneling microscopy. Inelastic charge-carrier injection into localized defect
states of 2D materials thus provides a powerful platform for electrically
driven, broadly tunable, atomic-scale single-photon sources.

framework to deal with infinite dimensional output spaces unlocks many more
applications, such as functional regression, structured output prediction, and
structured data representation. However, these sophisticated schemes crucially
rely on the kernel trick in the output space, so that most of previous works
have focused on the square norm loss function, completely neglecting robustness

this paper develops a duality approach that allows to solve OVK machines for a
wide range of loss functions. The infinite dimensional Lagrange multipliers are
handled through a Double Representer Theorem, and algorithms for
$\epsilon$-insensitive losses and the Huber loss are thoroughly detailed.
Robustness benefits are emphasized by a theoretical stability analysis, as well

highly generic, and shall arise universally in a wide class of quantum
materials with similar crystal symmetries. In addition, possible connections
between these edge photocurrents and topological properties of Weyl semimetals

approach for handling missing data. A central challenge for applying MICE is
determining how to incorporate outcome information into covariate imputation
models, particularly for complicated outcomes. Often, we have a particular
analysis model in mind, and we would like to ensure congeniality between the
imputation and analysis models.
  We propose a novel strategy for directly incorporating the analysis model
into the handling of missing data. In our proposed approach, multiple
imputations of missing covariates are obtained without using outcome
information. We then utilize the strategy of imputation stacking, where
multiple imputations are stacked on top of each other to create a large
dataset. The analysis model is then incorporated through weights. Instead of
applying multiple imputation combining rules, we obtain parameter estimates by
fitting a weighted version of the analysis model on the stacked dataset. We
propose a novel estimator for obtaining standard errors for this stacked and
weighted analysis. Our estimator is based on the observed data information
principle in Louis (1982) and can be applied for analyzing stacked multiple
imputations more generally. Our approach for analyzing stacked multiple
imputations is the first well-motivated method that can be easily applied for a
wide variety of standard analysis models and missing data settings.
  In simulations, the proposed strategy produced unbiased parameter estimates
when the analysis model was correctly specified. We developed an R package,
StackImpute, allowing this imputation approach to be easily implemented for
many standard analysis models.

closed over a communication network. In this article, the joint operation of
control and networking for NCS is investigated wherein the network serves the
sensor-to-controller communication links for multiple stochastic linear
time-invariant (LTI) sub-systems. The sensors sample packets based on the
observed plant state, which they send over a shared multi-hop network. The
network has limited communication resources, which need to be assigned to
competing links to support proper control loop operation. In this set-up, we
formulate an optimization problem to minimize the weighted-sum
linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) cost of all loops, taking into account the
admissible sampling, control, congestion control and scheduling policies. Under
some mild assumptions on the sampling frequencies of the control loops and the
communication network, we find the joint optimal solution to be given by a
certainty equivalence control with threshold-based sampling policy, as well as
a back-pressure type scheduler with a simple pass-through congestion control.
The interface between network and control loops is identified to be the buffer
state of the sensor node, which can be interpreted as network price for
sampling a packet from control perspective. We validate our theoretical claims
by simulating NCSs comprising of multiple LTI stochastic control loops
communicating over a two-hop cellular network.

effect has been widely studied in heavy metals with strong spin-orbit coupling.
While the high crystal symmetry in these materials limits the conversion to the
orthogonal configuration, unusual configurations are expected in low symmetry
transition metal dichalcogenide semimetals, which could add flexibility to the
electrical injection and detection of pure spin currents. Here, we report the
observation of spin-to-charge conversion in MoTe$_2$ flakes, which are stacked
in graphene lateral spin valves. We detect two distinct contributions arising
from the conversion of two different spin orientations. In addition to the
conventional conversion where the spin polarization is orthogonal to the charge
current, we also detect a conversion where the spin polarization and the charge
current are parallel. Both contributions, which could arise either from bulk
spin Hall effect or surface Edelstein effect, show large efficiencies
comparable to the best spin Hall metals and topological insulators. Our finding
enables the simultaneous conversion of spin currents with any in-plane spin
polarization in one single experimental configuration.

transport properties of Hamiltonians with simultaneous Holstein (diagonal) and

the separation of energy scales in semiconducting organic molecular cystals, in
which electrons couple to high-frequency intramolecular Holstein modes and to
low-frequency intermolecular Peierls modes. We treat Peierls modes as
quasi-classical dynamic disorder, while Holstein modes are included with a
Lang-Firsov polaron transformation and no narrow-band approximation. Our method
reduces to the popular polaron picture due to Holstein coupling and the dynamic
disorder picture due to Peierls coupling. We derive an expression for efficient
numerical evaluation of the frequency-resolved optical conductivity based on
the Kubo formula and obtain the DC mobility from its zero-frequency component.
We also use our method to calculate the electron-addition Green's function
corresponding to the inverse photoemission spectrum. For realistic parameters,
temperature-dependent DC mobility is largely determined by the Peierls-induced
dynamic disorder with minor quantitative corrections due to polaronic
band-narrowing, and an activated regime is not observed at relevant
temperatures. In contrast, for frequency-resolved observables, a quantum
mechanical treatment of the Holstein coupling is qualitatively important for
capturing the phonon replica satellite structure.

relation known as majorization. The numerical results, which exploit a

that the problem is equivalent to the persistence of a non-Markovian stochastic

non-separable channels when wired in series. We then introduce the notions of

characterize the power of EB superchannels for generating CP maps in different
scenarios, and it reveals some fundamental differences between channels and

generate entanglement using p- and q-dimensional ancillary systems. By
introducing and investigating k-EB maps, we construct examples of (p,q)-EB

star formation is crucial to put constraints on the collapse and accretion
processes as well as on the pristine properties of planet-forming seeds. We
analyze PdBI observations at 1.3 and 3.2 mm for 12 Class 0 protostars obtained
as part of the CALYPSO survey and derive dust emissivity index (beta) profiles
as a function of the envelope radius at 200-2000 au scales. Most of the
protostellar envelopes show low dust emissivity indices decreasing toward the
central regions. The decreasing trend remains after correction of the
(potentially optically-thick) central region emission, with surprisingly low
beta (lower than 1) values across most of the envelope radii of NGC1333-IRAS4A,
NGC1333-IRAS4B, SVS13B, and Serpens-SMM4. We discuss the various processes that
could explain such low and varying dust emissivity indices at envelope radii
200-2000 au. Our observations of extremely low dust emissivity indices could
trace the presence of large (mm-size) grains in Class 0 envelopes and a radial
increase of the dust grain size toward the inner envelope regions. While it is
expected that large grains in young protostellar envelopes could be built via
grain growth and coagulation, we stress that the typical timescales required to
build mm grains in current coagulation models are at odds with the youth of our
Class 0 protostars. Additional variations in the dust composition could also
partly contribute to the low beta we observe. The steepness of the beta radial
gradient depends strongly on the envelope mass, which might favor a scenario
where large grains are built in high density protostellar disks and transported
to the intermediate envelope radii, for example with the help of outflows and
winds.

star $\mu$ Cep and relating it to the photometric variability with the help of
the tomographic method. The tomographic method allows to recover the
line-of-sight velocity distribution over the stellar disk and within different
optical-depth slices. The method is applied to a series of high-resolution

the velocity field are compared with photometric and spectroscopic variations,
the latter being derived from the TiO band strength and serving (at least
partly) a proxy of the variations in effective temperature. The tomographic
method reveals a phase shift between the velocity and spectroscopic/photometric
variations. This phase shift results in a hysteresis loop in the temperature -
velocity plane, with a timescale of a few hundred days, similar to the
photometric one. The similarity between the hysteresis loop timescale measured
in $\mu$ Cep and the timescale of acoustic waves disturbing the convective
pattern suggests that such waves play an important role in triggering the

scenario with the renormalized Standard Model Higgs potential, since it also
allows inflation in a finite domain, but turns over at high scales due to the
running of the self-coupling, marking an exit from inflation. We compute the

The value of the optimal signal-to-noise ratio depends on the number and

phenomena have been extensively studied over the last two decades. The previous
studies have suggested the need of extremely fine control of the various system

out to understand the behavior of the scattering amplitude in the vicinity of
SS. Such study would be important towards the practical application of SS where
it is desired to maintain outgoing scattering amplitude to a specific value.
The behavior of the loci of constant scattering amplitude in the neighborhood
of SS are studied for a pure imaginary barrier potential $iV$, $V \in R^{+}$.
We show that these loci are elliptical and self-similar to each other in $E-V$

the problem of inconsistency between the neutron star long-period precession
and superfluid vortex pinning which is the base of most theories of pulsar
glitches. It was assumed that the pinning takes place in the region of the
neutron star core which, being magnetically decoupled, can rotate relative to
the crust. In present work some aspects of the glitch spin-up stage in the
framework of the proposed model are discussed. Estimated spin-up time-scales
are compared with observational data. According to the estimations the Crab
pulsar is likely posses a magnetically decoupling core region, while the
results for the Vela pulsar is more controversial.

socioeconomic context for research purposes, evaluation and monitoring health
inequalities. Methods: the index was created from the 2010 Brazilian
Demographic Census, whose variables selection was guided by theoretical
references for health studies, including seven socioeconomic dimensions:
education, mobility, poverty, wealth, income, segregation and deprivation of
resources and services. The index was developed using principal component
analysis, and was evaluated for its construct, content and applicability
components. Results: GeoSES-BR dimensions showed good association with HDI-M
(above 0.85). The model with the poverty dimension best explained the relative
risk of avoidable cause mortality in Brazil. In the intraurban scale, the model
with GeoSES-IM was the one that best explained the relative risk of mortality
from circulatory system diseases. Conclusion: GeoSES showed significant
explanatory potential in the studied scales.

13 supercongruences have been confirmed by using a wide range of methods. In
2015, Swisher conjectured Dwork-type supercongruences related to the first 12
supercongruences of Van Hamme. Here we prove that the (C.3) and (J.3)
supercongruences of Swisher are true modulo $p^{3r}$ (the original modulus is
$p^{4r}$) by establishing $q$-analogues of them. Our proof will use the
creative microscoping method, recently introduced by the author in
collaboration with Zudilin. We also raise conjectures on $q$-analogues of an
equivalent form of the (M.2) supercongruence of Van Hamme, partially answering
a question at the end of [Adv. Math. 346 (2019), 329--358].

(FSDT) plate model for 3-D web-core sandwich panels is developed. First, a 3-D
web-core unit cell is modeled by classical shell finite elements. A
discrete-to-continuum transformation is applied to the microscale unit cell and
its strain and kinetic energy densities are expressed in terms of the
macroscale 2-D plate kinematics. The hyperelastic constitutive relations and
the equations of motion (via Hamilton's principle) for the plate are derived by
assuming energy equivalence between the 3-D unit cell and the 2-D plate. The
Navier solution is developed for the 2-D micropolar ESL-FSDT plate model to
study the bending, buckling, and free vibration of simply-supported web-core
sandwich panels. In a line load bending problem, a 2-D classical ESL-FSDT plate
model yields displacement errors of 34-175% for face sheet thicknesses of 2-10
mm compared to a 3-D FE solution, whereas the 2-D micropolar model gives only
small errors of 2.7-3.4% as it can emulate the 3-D deformations better through
non-classical antisymmetric shear behavior and local bending and twisting.

$p$-adic integrals and blend these formulas with previously well known
formulas. Therefore, this article gives briefly the formulas of $p$-adic
integrals which were found previously, as well as applying the integral
equations to the generating functions and other special functions, giving
proofs of the new interesting and novel formulas. The $p$-adic integral
formulas provided in this article contain several important well-known families
of special numbers and special polynomials such as the Bernoulli numbers and
polynomials, the Euler numbers and polynomials, the Stirling numbers, the Lah
numbers, the Peters numbers and polynomials, the central factorial numbers, the
Daehee numbers and polynomials, the Changhee numbers and polynomials, the
Harmonic numbers, the Fubini numbers, combinatorial numbers and sums. In
addition, we defined two new sequences containing the Bernoulli numbers and
Euler numbers. These two sequences include central factorial numbers, Bernoulli
numbers and Euler numbers. Some computation formulas and identities for these
sequences are given. Finally we give further remarks, observations and comments
related to content of this paper.

  approach","9 pages, 15 figures",,,,"q-fin.GN econ.GN q-fin.EC q-fin.ST","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent advances in the fields of machine learning and neurofinance have
yielded new exciting research perspectives in practical inference of
behavioural economy in financial markets and microstructure study. We here
present the latest results from a recently published stock market simulator
built around a multi-agent system architecture, in which each agent is an
autonomous investor trading stocks by reinforcement learning (RL) via a
centralised double-auction limit order book. The RL framework allows for the
implementation of specific behavioural and cognitive traits known to trader
psychology, and thus to study the impact of these traits on the whole stock
market at the mesoscale. More precisely, we narrowed our agent design to three
such psychological biases known to have a direct correspondence with RL theory,
namely delay discounting, greed, and fear. We compared ensuing simulated data
to real stock market data over the past decade or so, and find that market
stability benefits from larger populations of agents prone to delay discounting
and most astonishingly, to greed.
