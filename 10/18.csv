the non-minimal curvature-matter coupling theories in which the field equations
are mathematically similar to the Einstein field equations in the presence of
cosmological constant, we find two classes of black hole (BH) solutions
including $i$) conformally flat solutions and $ii$) non-singular BHs. Accepting
the mass function definition and by using the entropy contents of the solutions
along with thermodynamic definitions of temperature and pressure, we study the
validity of Euler equation on the corresponding horizons. Our results show that
the thermodynamic pressure, meeting the Euler equation, is not always equal to
the pressure components appeared in the gravitational field equations and
satisfies the first law of thermodynamics, a result which in fact depends on
the presumed energy definition. The requirements of having solutions with equal
thermodynamic and Hawking temperatures are also studied. Additionally, we study
the conformally flat BHs in the Rastall framework. The consequences of
employing generalized Misner-Sharp mass in studying the validity of the Euler
equation are also addressed.

integrating heterogeneous IoT devices and deploying home automation
applications. However, serious privacy threats arise as device data now flow
out to the IoT platforms, which may be subject to various attacks. We observe
two privacy-unfriendly practices in emerging home automation systems: first,
the majority of data flowed to the platform are superfluous in the sense that
they do not trigger any home automation; second, home owners currently have
nearly zero control over their data.
  We present PFirewall, a customizable data-flow control system to enhance user
privacy. PFirewall analyzes the automation apps to extract their semantics,
which are automatically transformed into data-minimization policies; these
policies only send minimized data flows to the platform for app execution, such
that the ability of attackers to infer user privacy is significantly impaired.
In addition, PFirewall provides capabilities and interfaces for users to define
and enforce customizable policies based on individual privacy preferences.
PFirewall adopts an elegant man-in-the-middle design, transparently executing
data minimization and user-defined policies to process raw data flows and
mediating the processed data between IoT devices and the platform (via the
hub), without requiring modifications of the platform or IoT devices. We
implement PFirewall to work with two popular platforms: SmartThings and
openHAB, and set up two real-world testbeds to evaluate its performance. The
evaluation results show that PFirewall is very effective: it reduces IoT data
sent to the platform by 97% and enforces user defined policies successfully.

  Investigate the benefits of applying IRS in MEC networks",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Computation off-loading in mobile edge computing (MEC) systems constitutes an
efficient paradigm of supporting resource-intensive applications on mobile
devices. However, the benefit of MEC cannot be fully exploited, when the
communications link used for off-loading computational tasks is hostile.
Fortunately, the propagation-induced impairments may be mitigated by
intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), which are capable of enhancing both the
spectral- and energy-efficiency. Specifically, an IRS comprises an IRS
controller and a large number of passive reflecting elements, each of which may
impose a phase shift on the incident signal, thus collaboratively improving the
propagation environment. In this paper, the beneficial role of IRSs is
investigated in MEC systems, where single-antenna devices may opt for
off-loading a fraction of their computational tasks to the edge computing node
via a multi-antenna access point with the aid of an IRS. Pertinent
latency-minimization problems are formulated for both single-device and
multi-device scenarios, subject to practical constraints imposed on both the
edge computing capability and the IRS phase shift design. To solve this
problem, the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique is invoked to decouple
the original problem into two subproblems, and then the computing and
communications settings are alternatively optimized using low-complexity
iterative algorithms. It is demonstrated that our IRS-aided MEC system is
capable of significantly outperforming the conventional MEC system operating
without IRSs. Quantitatively, about $20~\%$ computational latency reduction is
achieved over the conventional MEC system in a single cell of a $300~\rm{m}$
radius and $5$ active devices, relying on a $5$-antenna access point.

interest for image forensics community, as they can be an effective tool for
recovering image history and identifying tampered images. Although several CE
forensic algorithms have been proposed, their accuracy and robustness against
some kinds of processing are still unsatisfactory. In order to attenuate such

fusion convolutional neural network to fuse the features of pixel and histogram
domains for CE forensics. Specifically, we first present a pixel-domain
convolutional neural network (P-CNN) to automatically capture the patterns of
contrast-enhanced images in the pixel domain. Then, we present a
histogram-domain convolutional neural network (H-CNN) to extract the features
in the histogram domain. The feature representations of pixel and histogram
domains are fused and fed into two fully connected layers for the
classification of contrast-enhanced images. Experimental results show that the
proposed method achieve better performance and is robust against pre-JPEG

improvement of CNN-based forensics is explored, which could provide guidance

fixed point (e.g. its initial position). This simple system already exhibits
the main features of interest induced by resetting: (i) the system reaches a
nontrivial nonequilibrium stationary state (ii) the mean time for the particle
to reach a target is finite and has a minimum, optimal, value as a function of
the resetting rate $r$. We then generalise to an arbitrary stochastic process
(e.g. L\'evy flights or fractional Brownian motion) and non-Poissonian
resetting (e.g. power-law waiting time distribution for intervals between
resetting events). We go on to discuss multiparticle systems as well as
extended systems, such as fluctuating interfaces, under resetting. We also
consider resetting with memory which implies resetting the process to some
randomly selected previous time. Finally we give an overview of recent
developments and applications in the field.

relative ages of chondrite components and timescales of physical and thermal
events that attended the formation of the Solar System. However, an important
assumption for using $^{26}$Al as a chronometer is its homogeneous distribution
in the disk.
  Yet, the oldest components in chondrites, the Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs),
which are usually considered as time anchors for this chronometer, show
evidence of $^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al variations independent of radioactive decay.
Since their formation epoch may have been contemporaneous with the collapse of
the parent cloud that formed the disk, this suggests that $^{26}$Al was
heteregeneously distributed in the cloud. We model the collapse of such an
heterogeneous cloud, using two different $^{26}$Al distributions (monotonic and
non-monotonic), and follow its re-distribution in the first condensates and
bulk dust that populate the forming disk.
  We find that CAIs inherit the $^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al ratio of the matter
infalling at the time of their formation, so that variations of
$^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al among primordial CAIs can be accounted for, independently
of radioactive decay. The prevalence of a canonical ratio among them and its
necessity for the differentiation of the first planetesimals suggest a
(monotonic) scenario where $^{26}$Al sharply rose relatively close to the
center of the protosolar cloud and essentially remained at a high level outward
(rather than decreased since). As the $ ^{26}$Al abundance would be relatively
homogeneous after cessation of infall, this would warrant the use of the Al-Mg
chronometer from the formation of ""regular"" CAIs onward, to chondrules and
chondrite accretion.

nonlinearly parameterized regressions--continuous or discrete time--and apply
it for system identification and adaptive control. We restrict our attention to
parameterizations that can be factorized as the product of two functions, a
measurable one and a nonlinear function of the parameters to be estimated.
Although in this case it is possible to define an extended vector of unknown
parameters to get a linear regression, it is well-known that
overparameterization suffers from some severe shortcomings. Another feature of
the proposed estimator is that parameter convergence is ensured without a
persistency of excitation assumption. It is assumed that, after a coordinate
change, some of the elements of the transformed function satisfy a monotonicity
condition. The proposed estimators are applied to design identifiers and
adaptive controllers for nonlinearly parameterized systems. In continuous-time
we consider a general class of nonlinear systems and those described by
Euler-Lagrange models, while in discrete-time we apply the method to the
challenging problems of direct and indirect adaptive pole-placement. The
effectiveness of our approach is illustrated with several classical examples,
which are traditionally tackled using overparameterization and assuming
persistency of excitation.

quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) relative to molecular dynamics (MD) for 10
sets of enantiotropic organic polymorphs. Relative to experiment we find that
MD, using an off-the-shelf point charge potential gets the sign of the
enthalpic contributions correct for 6 of the 10 pairs of polymorphs and the
sign of the entropic contributions correct for all pairs. We find that
anisotropic QHA provides little improvement to the error in free energy
differences from MD relative to isotropic QHA, but does a better job capturing
the thermal expansion of the crystals. A form of entropy-enthalpy compensation
allows the free energy differences of QHA to deviate less than 0.1 kcal/mol
from MD for most polymorphic pairs, despite errors up to 0.4 kcal/mol in the
entropy and enthalpy. Much of the error previously found between QHA and MD for
these flexible molecules is reduced when QHA is run from a lattice minimum
consistent with the same basin as MD, rather than the energy-minimized
experimental crystal structure. Specifically, performing anisotropic QHA on
lattice minimum quenched from low-temperature replica exchange simulations
reduced the error previously found by 0.2 kcal/mol on average. However, these
conformationally flexible molecules can have many low-temperature
conformational minima, and the choice of an inconsistent minima causes free
energies estimated from QHA to deviate from MD at temperatures as low as 10 K.
The errors between MD and experiment are 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than
those seen between QHA and MD, so the quality of the force field used is still
of primary concern, but this study illustrates a number of other important
factors that must be considered to obtain quantitative organic crystal

$m^{1+o(1)}$, for any slowly growing function $m$. We obtain deterministic

exhibiting a large subgraph of $G$ that has high conductance. We use this
algorithm to obtain deterministic algorithms for dynamic connectivity and
minimum spanning forest, whose worst-case update time on an $n$-vertex graph is
$n^{o(1)}$, thus resolving a major open problem in the area of dynamic graph

radiation-hydrodynamic equations and calculate the mass transfer rate in
asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) binaries that undergo the
wind-Roche-lobe-overflow or Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion. MESA
produces the density and temperature of the boundary condition of the AGB star.
To improve the resolution of the dynamics of a circumbinary disk, we implement
an azimuthal angle-dependent 3D radiation transfer. We consider optically thin
cooling and obtain the number density of the coolants by solving Saha
equations. One of the goals of this work is to illustrate the transition from
the wind-Roche-lobe-overflow to BHL accretion. Both circumbinary disks and
spiral structure outflows can appear in the simulations. Circumbinary disks may
form when the optical thickness in the equatorial region increases. The
increase of the optical thickness is due to the deflected wind. The resulting
mass transfer efficiency in our models is up to a factor of 8 times higher than
what the standard BHL accretion scenario predicts, and the outflow gains up to
91% of its initial angular momentum when it reaches 1.3 binary separations.
Consequently, some AGB binaries may undergo orbit shrinkage, and some will
expand. The high mass transfer efficiency is closely related to the presence of
the circumbinary disks.

biological origins. Here we show that thousands-to-millions of topological
solitons, dubbed ""skyrmions"", while each converting macroscopically-supplied
electric energy, exhibit collective motions along spontaneously-chosen

multi-skyrmion clustering and large-scale cohesion mediated by
out-of-equilibrium elastic interactions. Remarkably, this behavior arises under

by gas turbine and rocket motor manufacturers. The key instability mechanism is
described by the {\it Rayleigh criterion}. The Rayleigh criterion does not
directly show how to alter a system to make it more stable. This is the
objective of sensitivity analysis. Because thermoacoustic systems have many
design parameters, adjoint sensitivity analysis has been proposed to obtain all
the sensitivities with one extra calculation. Although adjoint sensitivity
analysis can be carried out in both the time and the frequency domain, the
frequency domain is more natural for a linear analysis. Perhaps surprisingly,
the Rayleigh criterion has not yet been rigorously derived and comprehensively
interpreted in the frequency domain. The contribution of this theoretical paper
is threefold. First, the Rayleigh criterion is interpreted in the frequency
domain with integral formulae for the complex eigenvalue. Second, the first
variation of the Rayleigh criterion is calculated both in the time and
frequency domain, both with and without Lagrange multipliers (adjoint
variables). The Lagrange multipliers are physically related to the system's
observables. Third, an adjoint Rayleigh criterion is proposed. The paper also
points out that the conclusions of {\it Juniper, M. P. (2018), Phys. Rev.

not to the Rayleigh criterion itself. The mathematical relations of this paper

enable optimal design.

my role as the critic in this conversation, I will summarize some arguments
about the lack of causal identification in the bulk of settings where the

This is a point that is discussed at length in D'Amour 2019 [arXiv:1902.10286],

of ""Blessings"". Second, I will argue that adding parametric assumptions to the
working model in order to obtain identification of causal parameters (a
strategy followed in Theorem 6 and in the experimental examples) is a risky
strategy, and should only be done when extremely strong prior information is
available. Finally, I will consider the implications of the nonparametric
identification results provided for a narrow, but non-trivial, set of causal
estimands in Theorems 7 and 8. I will highlight that these results may be even
more interesting from the perspective of detecting causal identification from
observed data, under relatively weak assumptions about confounders.

non-vanishing piezoelectricity and find that any gap closing with 1 fine-tuning
parameter between two gapped states changes either the $Z_2$ invariant or the
locally stable valley Chern number. The jump of the piezoelectric response is
found to exist for all these transitions, and we propose the HgTe/CdTe quantum
well and BaMnSb$_2$ as two potential experimental platforms. Our work provides
a general theoretical framework to classify topological quantum phase
transitions and reveals their ubiquitous relation to the piezoelectric
response.

Motivated by this hypothesis, we propose instance adaptive adversarial training

previous analyses by means of a more detailed computation and using the most

estimating for the first time its sensitivity to circular polarization. We find
that both LISA and ET, despite operating at different frequencies, could detect
net circular polarization with a signal-to-noise ratio of order one in a SGWB

case of a network of ground based detectors. We present fully analytical,

Recognition problem, where only knowledge of the positive class is available
for training. While classifiers have access to a few genuine signatures for
training, during generalization they also need to discriminate forgeries. This
is particularly challenging for skilled forgeries, where a forger practices
imitating the user's signature, and often is able to create forgeries visually
close to the original signatures. Most work in the literature address this
issue by training for a surrogate objective: discriminating genuine signatures
of a user and random forgeries (signatures from other users). In this work, we
propose a solution for this problem based on meta-learning, where there are two
levels of learning: a task-level (where a task is to learn a classifier for a
given user) and a meta-level (learning across tasks). In particular, the
meta-learner guides the adaptation (learning) of a classifier for each user,
which is a lightweight operation that only requires genuine signatures. The
meta-learning procedure learns what is common for the classification across
different users. In a scenario where skilled forgeries from a subset of users
are available, the meta-learner can guide classifiers to be discriminative of
skilled forgeries even if the classifiers themselves do not use skilled
forgeries for learning. Experiments conducted on the GPDS-960 dataset show
improved performance compared to Writer-Independent systems, and achieve
results comparable to state-of-the-art Writer-Dependent systems in the regime
of few samples per user (5 reference signatures).

model, three families of right-handed neutrino superfields are present in order
to solve the $\mu$ problem and simultaneously reproduce neutrino physics. The
new couplings and sneutrino vacuum expectation values in the $\mu\nu$SSM induce
new mixing of states, and, in particular, the three right sneutrinos can be
substantially mixed with the neutral Higgses. After diagonalization, the masses
of the corresponding three singlet-like eigenstates can be smaller or larger
than the mass of the Higgs, or even degenerated with it. We analyze whether
these situations are still compatible with the experimental results. To address
it we scan the parameter space of the Higgs sector of the model. In particular,
we sample the $\mu\nu$SSM using a powerful likelihood data-driven method,
paying special attention to satisfy the constraints coming from Higgs sector
measurements/limits (using HiggsBounds and HiggsSignals), as well as a class of
flavor observables such as $B$ and $\mu$ decays, while muon $g-2$ is briefly

less rotation supported galaxies also tend to have higher connectivity. These

methods. On the other hand, newer approaches are top-down and mixed methods
that consider the high level and semantic information of the image too. In this
paper, we introduce the proposed methods in both saliency detection and
retargeting. For the saliency detection, the use of image context and semantic
segmentation are examined, and a novel mixed bottom-up, and top-down saliency
detection method is introduced. After saliency detection, a modified version of
an existing retargeting method is utilized for retargeting the images. The
results suggest that the proposed image retargeting pipeline has excellent
performance compared to other tested methods. Also, the subjective evaluations
on the Pascal dataset can be used as a retargeting quality assessment dataset
for further research.

level, a simulation-based approach, which is verified with actual data, is
employed to determine the median duration and the median acceleration spectra
of ground motions expected to occur at the site. Afterward, at each intensity
level, artificial or spectrally matched motions are produced based on the
median acceleration spectra and the median duration, indicating that different
intensity levels are directly covered by the generated artificial or adjusted
motions rather than just scaling up and down a set of recorded ground motions.
In the proposed methodology, duration and acceleration spectral shape changes
against intensity level while they remain the same for different intensity
levels in approach where responses are derived by scaling up and down of a set
of ground motions. The functional relationship between duration and seismic
intensity level, which is vital for the estimation of median duration at each
intensity level, is firstly investigated for the sites with different soil
conditions and rupture distances. Not only is it demonstrated that the data can
fit into exponential functions, but the sensitivity of the functions against
different parameters is also explored as well. The proposed duration-consistent
incremental seismic assessment is used in nonlinear seismic assessment of two
single degree of freedom structures, with and without a degrading behavior
capability. It is revealed that when changes in duration and spectral shape of
the motions at different intensity levels are considered in the nonlinear
dynamic analysis, an impactful influence that cannot be easily ignored is
witnessed in the structural responses of incremental analyses.

the Planck UT78 mask, decreases the error in the measurement of the CMB
temperature power spectrum to the $0.02-0.03\%$ level at $\ell>200$ (and
$<0.26\%$ for all $\ell$), and reduces correlation to all the foregrounds. We
find equivalent or improved performance when compared to state-of-the-art

Faddeev and Jackiw proposed to impose Gauss' law on the action to find the
Hamiltonian reduced theory of QED. The reduction eliminates the scalar gauge
mode, renders the theory manifestly gauge invariant and the symplectic form
non-singular. In this work we show that while the predictions of the reduced
theory coincide with those of conventional QED for scattering events, it is
experimentally distinguishable. Quantum interference of charges traveling along
time-like Wilson loops that encircle (but remain clear of) electric fields is
sensitive to a relative phase shift due to an interaction with the scalar

exist in the reduced theory. Despite its prediction over six decades ago, and
in contrast to its well known magnetic counterpart, this electric Aharonov-Bohm

  Methods. We split the sample of AGN with known spectroscopic redshits
according to Mstar, SFR and specific BHAR, while matching the distributions in
terms of the other parameters, including redshift. We measure the projected
two-point correlation function wp(rp) and model it with the 2-halo term to
derive the large-scale bias b and the corresponding typical mass of the hosting
halo, for the different subsamples.
  Results. We found no significant dependence of the large-scale bias and
typical halo mass on galaxy stellar mass and specific BHAR for CCL Type 2 AGN
at mean z~1, while a negative dependence on SFR is observed, with lower SFR AGN
residing in richer environment. Mock catalogs of AGN matched to have the same
X-ray luminosity, stellar mass, specific BHAR and SFR of CCL Type 2 AGN, almost
reproduce the observed Mstar, specific BHAR and SFR-Mh relations, when assuming
a fraction of satellite AGN of 15%, which corresponds to a ratio between the
probabilities of satellite and central AGN of being active Q = 2. Mock matched
normal galaxies follow a slightly steeper Mstar -Mh relation with low mass mock
galaxies residing in less massive halos than mock AGN of similar mass, and are
less biased than mock AGN with similar specific BHAR and SFR, at least for Q >

coupling is through virtual photons, $\gamma^\ast$: (on-shell) $W$-boson
production (e.g., where the underlying interaction is $\nu_\ell + \gamma^\ast
\rightarrow \ell^- + W^+$) and trident production (e.g., where it is $\nu +
\gamma^\ast \rightarrow \nu + \ell_1^- + \ell_2^+$). These processes become
increasingly relevant at TeV--PeV energies. We undertake the first systematic
approach to these processes (and those with hadronic couplings through virtual
$W$ and $Z$ bosons), treating them together, avoiding common approximations,
considering all neutrino flavors and final states, and covering the energy
range $10\,$--$10^8$ GeV. In particular, we present the first complete
calculation of $W$-boson production and the first calculation of trident
production at TeV--PeV energies. When we use the same assumptions as in prior
work, we recover all of their major results. In a companion paper, we show that
these processes should be taken into account for IceCube-Gen2.

particle-level matrix element squared, and an integral over a target material-

structure factor can be derived in all three cases following the same

For electron transitions, we incorporate directional dependence and point out
potential daily modulation signals in anisotropic target materials. For single

calculation of phonon excitation through electron couplings. We also discuss
the interplay between single phonon excitations and nuclear recoils, and
clarify the role of Umklapp processes, which can dominate the single phonon

the flexibility of neural networks while maintaining Bayesian probabilistic

trajectory conditioned on the observed long-term sequential data of all
surrounding vehicles. This approach is verified by learning and predicting
lane-changing trajectories in complex traffic scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous counterparts in terms
of accuracy and uncertainty expressiveness. Moreover, the meta-learning
instinct of NPs enables our proposed ARNP model to capture global information
of all observations, thereby being able to adapt to new targets efficiently.

distance determination method based on early-type binary systems. The final
objective is to measure accurate, geometrical distances to galaxies beyond the
Magellanic Clouds with a precision of 2%. We start with the analysis of two
early-type systems for which we have collected all the required spectroscopic
and photometric data. Apart from catalog publications, these systems have not
been studied yet, and it is the first time the modeling of light and radial
velocity curves is performed for them. From the analysis we obtained precise
physical parameters of the components, including the masses measured with
precision of 0.6-1% and radii with precision of 0.4-3%. For one system we
determined the $(V-K)$ color and estimated the distance using the bolometric
flux scaling method (DM=18.47 $\pm$ 0.15 mag), which agrees well with our
accurate determination of the distance to the LMC from late-type giants. For
the same system we determined the surface brightness of individual stars using
our model, and checked that it is consistent with a recent surface brightness
-- color relation. We compared our results with evolution theory models of
massive stars and found they agree in general, however, models with higher
overshooting values give more consistent results. The age of the system was
estimated to from 11.7 to 13.8 Myr, depending on the model.

are spherical in shape at optical wavelengths, previous determinations of
speckle and correlation functions have modeled stars as circular discs rather
than spheres because of the mathematical tools available for partially coherent
fields on planar surfaces. However, with the incentive that most stars are
indeed shaped like spheres and not discs, the present paper models a star as a
spherical antenna composed of a random distribution of uncorrelated volume
sources within a thin surface layer (photosphere). Working directly with the
time-domain fields, a self-contained, straightforward, detailed derivation of
speckle patterns and correlation functions is given based on a novel, angularly
symmetric, spherical mode expansion with coefficients determined by the assumed
Lambertian nature of the star's radiation and the uniform asymptotic behavior
of the spherical Hankel functions. First-order spatially averaged and
temporally averaged correlation functions are proven to be identical and the
normalized second-order correlation function is shown to equal one plus the
square of the normalized first-order correlation function. The direct
time-domain approach reveals explicit expressions for the quasi-monochromatic
wave-packet fields of stellar radiation as well as new criteria for the
validity of the far-field approximation for the fields of incoherent sources

the origin of such connection remains elusive. To explore the cosmic build-up
of this scaling relation, we present an empirically-motivated model that tracks
galaxy and SMBH growth down to z=0. Starting from a random mass seed
distribution at z=10, we assume that each galaxy evolves on the star-forming
""main sequence"" (MS) and each BH follows the recently-derived stellar mass
(M$_{\star}$) dependent ratio between BH accretion rate and star formation
rate, going as BHAR/SFR$\propto$M$_{\star}^{0.73[+0.22,-0.29]}$. Our simple
recipe naturally describes the BH-galaxy build-up in two stages. At first, the
SMBH lags behind the host that evolves along the MS. Later, as the galaxy grows
in M$_{\star}$, our M$_{\star}$-dependent BHAR/SFR induces a super-linear BH
growth, as M$_{\rm BH}$$\propto$M$_{\star}^{1.7}$. According to this formalism,
smaller BH seeds increase their relative mass faster and earlier than bigger BH
seeds, at fixed M$_{\star}$, thus setting along a gradually tighter M$_{\rm
BH}$-M$_{\star}$ locus towards higher M$_{\star}$. Assuming reasonable values
of the radiative efficiency $\epsilon \sim$0.1, our empirical trend agrees with
both high-redshift model predictions and intrinsic M$_{\rm BH}$-M$_{\star}$
relations of local BHs. We speculate that the observed non-linear BH-galaxy
build-up is reflected in a twofold behavior with dark matter halo mass (M$_{\rm
DM}$), displaying a clear turnover at M$_{\rm
DM}\sim$2$\times$10$^{12}$M$_{\odot}$. While Supernovae-driven feedback
suppresses BH growth in smaller halos (BHAR/SFR$\propto$M$_{\rm DM}^{1.6}$),
above the M$_{\rm DM}$ threshold cold gas inflows possibly fuel both BH
accretion and star formation in a similar fashion (BHAR/SFR$\propto$M$_{\rm

known, very likely in a post-merging phase. Data from several observational
windows suggest a complex mass structure with interacting subsystems, which
makes the reconstruction of a realistic merging scenario very difficult. A
missing key element in this sense is unveiling the cluster mass distribution at
high resolution. We perform such a reconstruction of the cluster inner total
mass through a strong lensing model based on new spectroscopic redshift
measurements. We use data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on
the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to confirm 12 multiple images of 4 sources with
redshift values from 1.16 to 2.72. We also discover four new multiple images
and identify 29 cluster members and 35 foreground and background sources. The
resulting galaxy member and image catalogs are used to build five cluster total
mass models. The fiducial model consists of 111 small-scale subhalos plus a
diffuse component, which is centered $\sim2$ arcseconds away from the BCG
belonging to the east Abell 2163 subcluster. We confirm that the latter is well
represented by a single, large-scale mass component. Its strong elongation
towards a second (west) subcluster confirms the existence of a preferential
axis, corresponding to the merging direction. From the fiducial model, we
extrapolate the cumulative projected total mass profile and measure a value of
$M(<300\,$kpc$) = 1.43^{+0.07}_{-0.06}\times 10^{14}\,$M$_{\odot}$, which has a
significantly reduced statistical error compared with previous estimates,
thanks to the inclusion of the spectroscopic redshifts. Our strong lensing
results are very accurate: the model-predicted positions of the multiple images
are, on average, only $0.15$ arcseconds away from the observed ones.

that a shallow defect level near the conduction band minimum dominates the
electronic behavior, in contrast to the behavior of unfilled CoSb$_3$. To
analyze the results, we modeled the defect as having a single peak in the
density of states, occupied at low temperatures due to donated charges from
filler atoms. We fitted the NMR shifts and spin-lattice relaxation rates
allowing for arbitrary carrier densities and degeneracies. The results provide
a consistent picture for the Hall data, explaining the temperature dependence
of the carrier concentration. Furthermore, without adjusting model parameters,
we calculated Seebeck coefficient curves, which also provide good consistency.
In agreement with recently reported computational results, it appears that
composite native defects induced by the presence of filler atoms can explain
this behavior. These results provide a better understanding of the balance of
charge carriers, of crucial importance for designing improved thermoelectric
materials.

Wiedemann-Franz law and the high value of the resistivity in the high-field

single diffusion equation posed within the unit ball is coupled to a
two-component reaction diffusion equation posed on the bounding unit sphere
through a linear Robin boundary condition. Specifically, within the bulk we
consider a process of linear diffusion with point-source generation for a
bulk-bound activator. On the bounding surface we consider the classical
two-component Brusselator model where the feed term is replaced by the
restriction of the bulk-bound activator to the membrane. By considering the
singularly perturbed limit of a small diffusivity ratio between the
membrane-bound activator and inhibitor species, we use formal asymptotic
expansions to construct strongly localized quasi-equilibrium spot solutions and
study their linear stability. Our analysis reveals that bulk-membrane-coupling
can restrict the existence of localized spot solutions through a recirculation
mechanism. In addition we derive stability thresholds that illustrate the
effect of coupling on both competition and splitting instabilities. Finally, we
use higher-order matched asymptotic expansions to derive a system of
differential algebraic equations that describe the slow motion of spots. The
potential for new coupling induced dynamical behaviour is illustrated by
considering examples of one-, two-, and three-spot solutions.

due to the rapidly growing market demand for dialogue agents capable of
goal-oriented behaviour. Due to the business process nature of these

complex dialogue systems that dramatically eliminates the need for a designer
to manually specify a dialogue tree, which nearly all current systems have to
resort to when the interaction pattern falls outside standard patterns such as
slot filling. We propose a declarative representation of the dialogue agent to
be processed by state-of-the-art planning technology. Our proposed approach
covers all aspects of the process; from model solicitation to the execution of
the generated plans/dialogue agents. Along the way, we introduce novel planning
encodings for declarative dialogue synthesis, a variety of interfaces for
working with the specification as a dialogue architect, and a robust executor
for generalized contingent plans. We have created prototype implementations of
all components, and in this paper, we further demonstrate the resulting system
empirically.

adjustment. As the latter is a computational bottleneck for larger blocks,
parallel bundle adjustment has become an active area of research. Particularly,
consensus-based optimization methods have been shown to be suitable for this
task. We have extended them using covariance information derived by the
adjustment of individual three-dimensional (3D) points, i.e., ""triangulation""

behavior, but also avoids fiddling with the penalty parameter of standard
consensus-based approaches. The corresponding novel approach can also be seen
as a variant of resection / intersection schemes, where we adjust during
intersection a number of sub-blocks directly related to the number of threads
available on a computer each containing a fraction of the cameras of the block.

completely non-intrusive. These methods require historical appliance-level data
for training the model for each of the devices. This data is gathered by
putting a sensor on each of the appliances present in the home which causes
intrusion in the building. Some recent studies have proposed that if we frame
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) as a multi-label classification problem,
the need for appliance-level data can be avoided. In this paper, we propose
Multi-label Restricted Boltzmann Machine(ML-RBM) for NILM and report an
experimental evaluation of proposed and state-of-the-art techniques.

is one of the key effects in quantum optics. In the cavity QED approach to
plasmonics, strongly coupled systems are usually understood as
single-transition emitters resonantly coupled to a single radiative plasmonic
mode. However, plasmonic cavities also support non-radiative (or ""dark"") modes,
which offer much higher coupling strengths. On the other hand, realistic
quantum emitters often support multiple electronic transitions of various
symmetry, which could overlap with higher order plasmonic transitions -- in the
blue or ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Here, we show that vacuum Rabi
splitting with a single emitter can be achieved by leveraging dark modes of a
plasmonic nanocavity. Specifically, we show that a significantly detuned
electronic transition can be hybridized with a dark plasmon pseudomode,
resulting in the vacuum Rabi splitting of the bright dipolar plasmon mode. We
develop a simple model illustrating the modification of the system response in
the ""dark"" strong coupling regime and demonstrate single photon non-linearity.
These results may find important implications in the emerging field of room

energy applications due to their high optical transparency, as well as
controllable carrier concentration and electrical conductivity. There are many
categories of materials that can be defined as wide band gap semiconductors.
The most intensively investigated are transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) such
as ITO and IGZO used in displays, carbides and nitrides used in power
electronics, as well as emerging halides (e.g. CuI) and 2D electronic materials
used in various optoelectronic devices. Chalcogen-based (S, Se, Te) wide band
gap semiconductors are less heavily investigated but stand out due to their
propensity for p-type doping, high mobilities, high valence band positions
(i.e. low ionization potentials), and broad applications in electronic devices
such as CdTe solar cells. This manuscript provides a review of wide band gap
chalcogenide semiconductors. First, we outline general materials design
parameters of high performing transparent conductors. We proceed to summarize
progress in wide band gap (Eg > 2 eV) chalcogenide materials, such as II-VI MCh
binaries, CuMCh2 chalcopyrites, Cu3MCh4 sulvanites, mixed anion layered
CuMCh(O,F), and 2D materials, among others, and discuss computational
predictions of potential new candidates in this family, highlighting their
optical and electrical properties. We finally review applications of
chalcogenide wide band gap semiconductors, e.g. photovoltaic and
photoelectrochemical solar cells, transparent transistors, and diodes, that
employ wide band gap chalcogenides as either an active or passive layer. By
examining, categorizing, and discussing prospective directions in wide band gap
chalcogenides, this review aims to inspire continued research on this emerging
class of transparent conductors and to enable future innovations for

integrates multiple instance learning into an adversarial deep domain
adaptation framework to train an Inflated 3D-CNN (I3D) model such that it can
accurately estimate pain intensities in the target operational domain. The
training process relies on weak target loss, along with domain loss and source
loss for domain adaptation of the I3D model. Experimental results obtained
using labeled source domain RECOLA videos and weakly-labeled target domain
UNBC-McMaster videos indicate that the proposed deep WSDA approach can achieve
significantly higher level of sequence (bag)-level and frame (instance)-level

geometric means or interactions with different length scales. As the former
leads to much simpler theoretical treatments it is favored and so magnetic
sublattices with geometric frustration are sought after. One approach to
finding such lattices is to design them chemically by using non-magnetic linker
ligands. Here we report on the magnetic properties of one such family of
materials, the transition metal ($TM$) selenite hydrate compounds chemical
formula $TM_3$(SeO$_3$)$_3$H$_2$O . These materials link highly distorted
$TM$O$_6$ octahedra via non-magnetic [SeO$_3$]$^{2+}$ linkers. Using $TM$ = Mn,
Co and Ni we report on the structural effects of changing the $TM$ site and how
they may influence the magnetic structure. Using magnetic susceptibility and
neutron powder diffraction we identify low temperature magnetic transitions for
all three compounds characterized by the onset of long-range AFM order with
moderate frustration indexes. Consideration of the magnetic structures reveal
that the magnetic order is sensitive to the $TM$ site ion and is tunable as it
is changed - especially from Mn to Co - with changes in both the moment
direction and the ordering vector. Field dependent susceptibility and heat
capacity measurements reveal metamagnetic transitions in both
Mn$_3$(SeO$_3$)$_3$H$_2$O and Co$_3$(SeO$_3$)$_3$H$_2$O indicating nearby
magnetic ground states accessible under relatively small applied fields.
Density functional theory calculations broadly confirm these results, showing
both a sensitivity of the magnetic structure to the $TM$ and its local
environment. Although no spin liquid behavior is achieved, these results
suggest the fruitfulness of such synthesis philosophies and encourage future
work to engender higher frustration in these materials via doping, field,
pressure or larger linker ligands.

Using this approach, we examined the relation of serum potassium measurements
and survival in the Cerner Real World Data (CRWD) EHR database. Analyzing this
data requires the evaluation of an integral in over 3 million dimensions. We
also assessed the scalability and accuracy of LA in smaller samples of 1 and
10% size of the full dataset that were analyzed via the a) original,
interconnected Generalized Linear Models (iGLM), approach to h-lik, b) Adaptive
Gaussian Hermite (AGH) and c) the gold standard of Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) for multivariate integration. Random effects estimates generated by the
LA were within 10% of the values obtained by the iGLMs, AGH and MCMC
techniques. The H-lik approach was 4-30 times faster than AGH and nearly 800
times faster than MCMC. We found that the combination of the LA and AD offers a
computationally efficient, numerically accurate approach for the analysis of
extremely large, real world repeated measures data via the h-lik approach to
GLMMs. The clinical inference from our analysis may guide choices of threatment
thresholds for treating potassium disorders in the clinic.

objects. The ability to accurately predict the effect of pushes can enable
efficient trajectory planning and complicated object manipulation. Physical
prediction models for planar pushing have long been established, but their

Data-driven approaches can provide accurate predictions for offline data, but
they often have generalizability issues. In this paper, we propose a combined

The combined model consists of a neural network module and analytical
components with a low-dimensional parameter. We train the neural network
offline using pre-collected pushing data. In online situations, the
low-dimensional analytical parameter is learned directly from online pushes to
quickly adapt to the new environments. We test our combined model and learning
framework on real pushing experiments. Our experimental results show that our
model is able to quickly adapt to new environments while achieving similar
final prediction performance as that of pure neural network models.

algorithm for combinatorial optimization problems whose performance can only
improve with the number of layers $p$. While QAOA holds promise as an algorithm
that can be run on near-term quantum computers, its computational power has not
been fully explored. In this work, we study the QAOA applied to the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, which can be understood as energy
minimization of $n$ spins with all-to-all random signed couplings. There is a
recent classical algorithm by Montanari that, assuming a widely believed
conjecture, can efficiently find an approximate solution for a typical instance
of the SK model to within $(1-\epsilon)$ times the ground state energy. We hope
to match its performance with the QAOA.
  Our main result is a novel technique that allows us to evaluate the
typical-instance energy of the QAOA applied to the SK model. We produce a
formula for the expected value of the energy, as a function of the $2p$ QAOA
parameters, in the infinite size limit that can be evaluated on a computer with
$O(16^p)$ complexity. We evaluate the formula up to $p=12$, and find that the
QAOA at $p=11$ outperforms the standard semidefinite programming algorithm.
Moreover, we show concentration: With probability tending to one as
$n\to\infty$, measurements of the QAOA will produce strings whose energies
concentrate at our calculated value. As an algorithm running on a quantum
computer, there is no need to search for optimal parameters on an
instance-by-instance basis since we can determine them in advance. What we have
here is a new framework for analyzing the QAOA, and our techniques can be of
broad interest for evaluating its performance on more general problems where
classical algorithms may fail.

reduced models, in which only the interactions among the species of interest

In this paper, we extend these results to SU($n$) chains in the symmetric

Finally, if $p$ and $n$ have a greatest common divisor $1<q<n$, we predict a
ground state degeneracy of $n/q$, with a finite energy gap. To arrive at these
results, we derive a non-Lorentz invariant flag manifold sigma model
description of the SU($n$) chains, and use the renormalization group to show
that Lorentz invariance is restored at low energies. We then make use of

employ kinetic winds to model galactic outflows, a crucial ingredient in
obtaining predictions that agree with various observations. Yet systematic
studies of how variations in kinetic wind scalings might alter observable
galaxy properties are rare. Here we employ GADGET-3 simulations to study how
the baryon cycle, stellar mass function, and other galaxy and CGM predictions
vary as a function of the assumed outflow speed $v_w$ and the scaling of the
mass loading factor $\eta$ with velocity dispersion $\sigma$. We design our
fiducial model to reproduce the measured wind properties at 25% of the virial
radius from the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. We find
that a strong dependence of $\eta \sim \sigma^5$ in low mass haloes with
$\sigma < 106\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$ is required to match the faint end of the
stellar mass functions at $z > 1$. The wind speed also has a major impact, with
faster winds significantly reducing wind recycling and heating more halo gas.
Both effects result in less stellar mass growth in massive haloes and impact
high ionization absorption in halo gas. We cannot simultaneously match the
stellar content at $z=2$ and $z=0$ within a single model, suggesting that an
additional feedback source such as AGN might be required in massive galaxies at
lower redshifts, but the amount needed depends strongly on assumptions
regarding the outflow properties. We run a 50 $\mathrm{Mpc/h}$, $2\times576^3$
simulation with our fiducial parameters and show that it matches a range of
star-forming galaxy properties at $z\sim0-2$. In closing, the results from
simulations of galaxy formation are much more sensitive to small changes in the
feedback implementation than to the hydrodynamic technique.

fact in many time series from economics and finance. The fractionally

  Employing pseudo-out-of-sample forecasting on inflation and realized
volatility time series and simulations we show that methods based on fractional

memory, including autoregressions and exponential smoothing. Our proposal of
choosing a fixed fractional integration parameter of $d=0.5$ a priori yields
the best results overall, capturing long memory behavior, but overcoming the
deficiencies of methods using an estimated parameter.
  Regarding the implementation of forecasting methods based on fractional
integration, we use simulations to compare local and global semiparametric and
parametric estimators of the long memory parameter from the Whittle family and
provide asymptotic theory backed up by simulations to compare different mean
estimators. Both of these analyses lead to new results, which are also of
interest outside the realm of forecasting.

Oort Cloud comets with perihelia near 2 AU show strong evidence of the original

set of such vacua. It can be done, for example, using two non-perturbative
exponents in the superpotential for each modulus, as in the KL model. A large
set of supersymmetric Minkowski vacua with strongly stabilized moduli is
protected by a theorem on stability of these vacua in absence of flat
directions. The second step involves a parametrically small downshift to a
supersymmetric AdS vacuum, which can be achieved by a small change of the
superpotential. The third step is an uplift to a dS vacuum with a positive
cosmological constant using the $\overline {D6}$-brane contribution. Stability
of the resulting dS vacuum is inherited from the stability of the original

the high-order comprehensive connectivity information can be extracted by the

can help the incompatible domains to transfer the knowledge across each other.

with certain difference conditions. Bressoud's conjecture specializes to a wide

his conjecture have been subsequently proved by Bressoud, Andrews, Kim and Yee.
Recently, Kim resolved Bressoud's conjecture for the case $j=1$. In this paper,
we introduce a new partition function $\bar{B}_j$ which can be viewed as an
overpartition analogue of the partition function $B_j$ introduced by Bressoud.
By means of Gordon markings, we build bijections to obtain a relationship
between $\bar{B}_1$ and $B_0$ and a relationship between $\bar{B}_0$ and $B_1$.
Based on these former relationships, we further give overpartition analogues of

continuous occupancy field remain computationally expensive or heuristic in
nature. Our method explores a generalisation of the so-called Ising model as a

quite attractive as it requires only a small number of hyperparameters to be

We here propose a method to implement a universal controlled-phase gate of two
hybrid qubits via two three-dimensional (3D) microwave cavities coupled to a
superconducting flux qutrit. For the gate considered here, the control qubit is
a microwave photonic qubit (particle-like qubit), whose two logic states are
encoded by the vacuum state and the single-photon state of a cavity, while the
target qubit is a cat-state qubit (wave-like qubit), whose two logic states are
encoded by the two orthogonal cat states of the other cavity. During the gate
operation, the qutrit remains in the ground state; therefore decoherence from
the qutrit is greatly suppressed. The gate realization is quite simple, because
only a single basic operation is employed and neither classical pulse nor
measurement is used. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that with current
circuit QED technology, this gate can be realized with a high fidelity. The
generality of this proposal allows to implement the proposed gate in a wide
range of physical systems, such as two 1D or 3D microwave or optical cavities
coupled to a natural or artificial three-level atom. Finally, this proposal can
be applied to create a novel entangled state between a particle-like photonic
qubit and a wave-like cat-state qubit.

specific task information to narrow down the solution space for the
optimization-based image modeling problem. Thanks to the flexibility of TLF,
both designed and trained constraints can be embedded into the optimization
process. By introducing control mechanisms based on the monotonicity and
boundedness conditions, we can also strictly prove the convergence of our
proposed inference process. We demonstrate that different types of image
modeling problems, such as image deblurring and rain streaks removals, can all
be appropriately addressed within our TLF framework. Extensive experiments also
verify the theoretical results and show the advantages of our method against

complex modulus, which describes completely the weakly nonlinear response of a
viscoelastic material in an arbitrary simple shear flow. In this first part, we
discuss several theoretical aspects of this mathematical formulation and new
material property. For example, we show how MAPS measurements can be performed
in strain- or stress-controlled contexts and provide relationships between the
weakly nonlinear response functions measured in each case. We show that the
MAPS response function is a super-set of the response functions that have been
previously reported in medium amplitude oscillatory shear and parallel
superposition rheology experiments. We also show how to exploit inherent
symmetries of the MAPS response function to reduce it to a minimal domain for
straightforward measurement and visualization. We compute this material
property for a few constitutive models to illustrate the potential richness of
the data sets generated by MAPS experiments. Finally, we discuss the MAPS
framework in the context of some other nonlinear, time-dependent rheological
probes and explain how the MAPS methodology has a distinct advantage over these
others because it generates data embedded in a very high dimensional space

algebras of observables via insertion operators localized in partially thin
Riemann surfaces. We apply our framework to solve old problems about conformal
nets and subfactors (e.g. rationality of all WZW conformal nets), obtain new
results about VOAs (e.g. unitarity of representation categories), and give
short proofs of many old results. We also consider a general class of
positivity phenomena for VOAs, and use this to outline a program for
identifying unitary tensor product theories of VOAs and conformal nets even for
badly-behaved models.

deployed to a broad range of applications, such as aerial photography, fast
goods delivery and most importantly, surveillance. Despite the great progress
achieved in computer vision algorithms, these algorithms are not usually
optimized for dealing with images or video sequences acquired by drones, due to
various challenges such as occlusion, fast camera motion and pose variation. In
this paper, a drone-based multi-object tracking and 3D localization scheme is
proposed based on the deep learning based object detection. We first combine a
multi-object tracking method called TrackletNet Tracker (TNT) which utilizes
temporal and appearance information to track detected objects located on the
ground for UAV applications. Then, we are also able to localize the tracked
ground objects based on the group plane estimated from the Multi-View Stereo
technique. The system deployed on the drone can not only detect and track the
objects in a scene, but can also localize their 3D coordinates in meters with
respect to the drone camera. The experiments have proved our tracker can
reliably handle most of the detected objects captured by drones and achieve
favorable 3D localization performance when compared with the state-of-the-art
methods.

training, an augmented ImageNet-VID dataset was used in conjunction with the
one cycle policy, enabling it to reach convergence with less than 2 epoch worth

on an additional small, albeit challenging custom UAV dataset collected with

from the literature is extended where the interface is incorporated by a local
reduction of the fracture toughness. Secondly, variations of the elastic
properties across the interface are enabled by approximating the abrupt change
between two adjacent subdomains using a hyperbolic tangent function, which
alters the elastic material parameters accordingly.
  The approach is validated qualitatively by means of crack patterns and
quantitatively with respect to critical energy release rates with fundamental
analytical results from Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics, where a crack
impinges an arbitrarily oriented interface and either branches, gets deflected
or experiences no interfacial influence. The model is particularly relevant for

popular. Such random mapping is called similarity-preserving hashing and
approximates a similarity metric by using the Hamming distance. Although many
efficient similarity searches have been proposed, most of them are designed for
binary sketches. Similarity searches on integer sketches are in their infancy.
In this paper, we present a novel space-efficient trie named $b$-bit sketch
trie on integer sketches for scalable similarity searches by leveraging the
idea behind succinct data structures (i.e., space-efficient data structures
while supporting various data operations in the compressed format) and a
favorable property of integer sketches as fixed-length strings. Our
experimental results obtained using real-world datasets show that a trie-based
index is built from integer sketches and efficiently performs similarity
searches on the index by pruning useless portions of the search space, which
greatly improves the search time and space-efficiency of the similarity search.
The experimental results show that our similarity search is at most one order
of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art similarity searches. Besides, our
method needs only 10 GiB of memory on a billion-scale database, while
state-of-the-art similarity searches need 29 GiB of memory.

experiment is entangled or not. In the literature, this topic was studied
extensively and researchers proposed different approaches for the detection of
mixed bipartite entangled state in arbitrary dimension. Proceeding in this line
of research, we also propose three different criteria for the detection of
mixed bipartite negative partial transpose (NPT) entangled state in arbitrary
dimension. Our criteria is based on the method of structural physical
approximation (SPA) of partial transposition (PT). We have shown that the
proposed criteria for the detection of NPT entangled state can be realized
experimentally. Two of the proposed criteria is given in terms of the
concurrence of the given state in arbitrary dimension so it is essential to
find out the concurrence. Thus, we provide new lower and upper bound of
concurrence of the quantum state under investigation in terms of average
fidelity of two quantum states and hence these bounds can be realized
experimentally. Moreover, we have shown how to perform SPA map on qutrit-qubit
system and then explicitly calculated the matrix elements of the density matrix
describing the SPA-PT of the qutrit-qubit system. We then illustrate our
criteria for the detection of entanglement by considering a class of
qubit-qubit system and a class of qutrit-qubit system.

maximum) of the conditional density function of the output variable given input
variables, and has led to regression methods robust against heavy-tailed or
skewed noises. The conditional mode is often estimated through maximization of
the modal regression risk (MRR). In order to apply a gradient method for the
maximization, the fundamental challenge is accurate approximation of the
gradient of MRR, not MRR itself. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we
take a novel approach of directly approximating the gradient of MRR. To
approximate the gradient, we develop kernelized and neural-network-based
versions of the least-squares log-density derivative estimator, which directly
approximates the derivative of the log-density without density estimation. With
direct approximation of the MRR gradient, we first propose a modal regression
method with kernels, and derive a new parameter update rule based on a
fixed-point method. Then, the derived update rule is theoretically proved to
have a monotonic hill-climbing property towards the conditional mode.
Furthermore, we indicate that our approach of directly approximating the
gradient is compatible with recent sophisticated stochastic gradient methods
(e.g., Adam), and then propose another modal regression method based on neural
networks. Finally, the superior performance of the proposed methods is
demonstrated on various artificial and benchmark datasets.

large graphs. While extracting small representative subgraphs from large

Several sampling algorithms have been proposed in previous studies, but they
lack in extracting good samples. In this paper, we propose a new sampling
method called Weighted Edge Sampling. In this method, we give equal weight to
all the edges in the beginning. During the sampling process, we sample an edge
with the probability proportional to its weight. When an edge is sampled, we
increase the weight of its neighboring edges and this increases their
probability to be sampled. Our method extracts the neighborhood of a sampled
edge more efficiently than previous approaches. We evaluate the efficacy of our
sampling approach empirically using several real-world data sets and compare it
with some of the previous approaches. We find that our method produces samples

very broad H-beta emission from active nuclei, as well as a broad second
component to the [OIII] (495.9 nm, 500.7 nm) doublet lines that is blue shifted
by 100 km/s, indicating the presence of gas outflows in these galaxies. The
composite spectra allow us to detect and measure the temperature-sensitive
[OIII] (436.3 nm) line and obtain metallicities using the direct method. The
metallicities of intermediate stellar mass (8.8<log(M*/Msun)<10) WiggleZ
galaxies are consistent with normal emission-line galaxies at the same masses.
In contrast, the metallicities of high stellar mass (10<log(M*/Msun)<12)
WiggleZ galaxies are significantly lower than for normal emission-line galaxies
at the same masses. This is not an effect of evolution as the metallicities do
not vary with redshift; it is most likely a property specific to the extremely
UV-luminous WiggleZ galaxies.

coordinates $\boldsymbol{P} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 3}$ and point features
$\boldsymbol{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ as input ($n$ and $d$ denote the
number of points and the number of feature channels, respectively). The state
of PointRNN is composed of point coordinates $\boldsymbol{P}$ and point states
$\boldsymbol{S} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d'}$ ($d'$ denotes the number of state
channels). Similarly, the output of PointRNN is composed of $\boldsymbol{P}$
and new point features $\boldsymbol{Y} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d''}$ ($d''$

point features and states from two time steps can not be directly operated.
Therefore, a point-based spatiotemporally-local correlation is adopted to
aggregate point features and states according to point coordinates. We further
propose two variants of PointRNN, i.e., Point Gated Recurrent Unit (PointGRU)
and Point Long Short-Term Memory (PointLSTM). We apply PointRNN, PointGRU and
PointLSTM to moving point cloud prediction, which aims to predict the future
trajectories of points in a set given their history movements. Experimental
results show that PointRNN, PointGRU and PointLSTM are able to produce correct
predictions on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating their
ability to model point cloud sequences. The code has been released at

D2D-enabled caching cellular networks is investigated for UT edge caching
incentive and content caching redundancy reduction. Firstly, a multi-winner
once auction for UT edge caching is modeled which auctions multiple contents
for multiple UTs. Then the optimization problem for content caching revenue
maximization is formulated. Specifically, the ""cache conflict"" restriction
relationship among UTs is used as one of the constraints in the problem to
reduce the content caching redundancy in a UT movement scenario. The problem is
solved by semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation to obtain an approximate
optimal caching placement. Moreover, the payment strategy of the auction is
developed as a Nash bargaining game for personal profit fairness among the UTs
who win the auction for content caching. Subsequently, a multi-winner once
auction based caching (MOAC) placement algorithm is proposed. In addition, due
to the high complexity of MOAC, we further propose a heuristic multi-winner
repeated auction based caching placement (MRAC) algorithm, which can greatly
reduce the complexity with only tiny performance loss. Simulation results show
that the proposed algorithms can reduce the traffic load and average content
access delay effectively compared with the existing caching placement
algorithms.

with enhanced fmax. For such a purpose, we used a drift-diffusion simulator
that includes several factors that influence output conductance, especially at
short channel lengths and-or large drain bias: short-channel electrostatics,
saturation velocity, graphene-dielectric interface traps, and self-heating
effects. As a testbed for our investigation, we analyzed fabricated GFETs with
high extrinsin cutoff frequency fT,x (34 GHz) and fmax (37 GHz). Our
simulations allow for a microscopic (local) analysis of the channel parameteres
such as carrier concentration, drift and saturation velocities. For biases far
away from the Dirac voltage, where the channel behaves as unipolar, we
confirmed that the higher is the drift velocity, as close as possible to the
saturation velocity, the greater fmax is. However, the largest fmax is recorded
at biases near the crossover between unipolar and bipolar behavior, where it
does not hold that the highest drift velocity maximizes fmax. In fact, the
position and magnitude of the largest fmax depend on the complex interplay
between the carrier concentration and total velocity which, in turn, are
impacted by the self-heating. Importantly, this effect was found to severely
limit radio-frequency performance, reducing the maximum fmax from around 60 to
40 GHz.

paper, we discussed the constraining power of multiple configurations of

background predicted in string cosmology. The constraining power is jointly
determined by the overlap reduction function and the sensitivity curves of
multiple detectors. And we further elaborated on the possible contribution of a

detector network for stochastic background in string cosmology. Our results
show that the detectability of the GWD network for the string cosmology

Chinese detector. This is because a Chinese detector (e.g. located at Wuhan )
together with KAGRA, has a better overlap reduction function than the laser
interferometer gravitational wave observatory detector pair, and therefore lead
to more stringent limits for stochastic background detection. And with ideal
overlap reduction function, namely, colocated detectors, a kilohertz
sensitivity curve has better performance than previous detectors for stochastic
background detection. Finally, the results are compared with the limitations

December 2000, and the 0.2-2.0 keV light curve revealed again a periodic
modulation, with a period of 4.68+-0.26h, significant only in the first of the
two observations. Taking into account the large uncertainties (the 2001 period

many insights have been gained into CP violation in the 2HDM and 3HDM by
studying how generalized CP transformations (GCPs) act in this bilinear space.
These insights relied on the fact that GCPs, which involved an odd number of

transformations by the sign of the determinant of the transformation matrix. It
was recently pointed out that this criterion fails starting from 4HDM, where
the reflection/rotation dichotomy does not exist anymore. In this paper, we
restore intuition by finding a different quantity which faithfully
discriminates between GCPs and Higgs family transformations in the bilinear

powered by accretion and rotation in the Galactic field, we investigate the
spin period (P) and spin-down power (Edot) distributions of the MSPs observed
at the wavebands of radio, X-ray, and {\gamma}-ray. We find that all but one
(119/120) of the {\gamma}-ray MSPs have been detected with the radio signals
(radio+{\gamma} MSPs); on the contrary, nearly half of the radio MSPs (118/237)
have not been detected with {\gamma}-rays (radio-only MSPs). In addition, the
radio+{\gamma} MSPs are shown to be the relative faster and more energetic
objects (<P> ~ 3.28 ms and <Edot> ~ 4.5 * 10^34 erg s^-1) compared with the
radio-only MSPs (<P> ~ 4.70 ms and <Edot> ~ 1.0 * 10^34 erg s^-1), while the
spin periods of these two MSP populations are compatible with the log-normal
distributions by the statistical tests. Most rotation-powered MSPs (RMSPs) with
the radio eclipsing (31/34) exhibit the radio+{\gamma} signals, which share the
faster spin (<P> ~ 2.78 ms) and larger spin-down power (<Edot> ~ 4.1 * 10^34
erg s^-1) distributions than the non-eclipsing ones (<P> ~ 4.19 ms, <Edot> ~
2.4 * 10^34 erg s^-1), implying the radio+{\gamma} MSPs to be younger than the
radio-only MSPs. It is noticed that the spin distribution of the
accretion-powered X-ray MSPs shows a clustering phenomenon around ~ 1.6-2.0 ms,
which is not observed in RMSPs, hinting that the RMSPs may experience the
multiple possible origins. Particularly, all the three super-fast spinning
RMSPs with P ~ 1.4-1.6 ms exhibit the non-eclipsing, and we argue that they may
be the distinctive sources formed by the accretion induced collapse (AIC) of
white dwarfs.

volcanic systems. The timescale of melt extraction from the mantle has been
hotly debated. Microstructural measurements of permeability typically suggest
relatively slow melt extraction (1 m/yr) whereas geochemical (Uranium-decay
series) and geophysical observations suggest much faster melt extraction (100
m/yr). The deglaciation of Iceland triggered additional mantle melting and
magma flux at the surface. The rapid response has been used to argue for
relatively rapid melt extraction. However, this episode must, at least to some
extent, be unrepresentative, because the rates of magma eruption at the surface
increased about thirty-fold relative to the steady state. Our goal is to
quantify this unrepresentativeness. We develop a one-dimensional,
time-dependent and nonlinear (far from steady-state), model forced by the most
recent, and best mapped, Icelandic deglaciation. We find that 30 m/yr is the
best estimate of the steady-state maximum melt velocity. This is a factor of
about 3 smaller than previously claimed, but still relatively fast. We
translate these estimates to other mid-ocean ridges accounting for differences
in passive and active upwelling and degree of melting. We find that fast melt
extraction greater than about 10 m/yr prevails globally.

astronomy has gained importance over the last decade due to the discovery of
fast radio bursts. Existing or upcoming radio telescopes are gathering more and
more data and consequently the software, which is an important part of these
telescopes, must process large data volumes at high data rates. Data has to be
searched through to detect new and interesting events, often in real-time.
These requirements necessitate new and fast algorithms which must process data
quickly and accurately. In this work we present new algorithms for single pulse
detection using boxcar filters. We have quantified the signal loss introduced
by single pulse detection algorithms which use boxcar filters and based on
these results, we have designed two distinct ""lossy"" algorithms. Our lossy
algorithms use an incomplete set of boxcar filters to accelerate detection at
the expense of a small reduction in detected signal power. We present formulae
for signal loss, descriptions of our algorithms and their parallel
implementation on NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA. We also present tests of correctness,
tests on artificial data and the performance achieved. Our implementation can
process SKA-MID-like data 266$\times$ faster than real-time on a NVIDIA P100
GPU and 500x faster than real-time on a NVIDIA Titan V GPU with a mean signal
power loss of 7%. We conclude with prospects for single pulse detection for
beyond SKA era, nanosecond time resolution radio astronomy.

varies in time, with the aim of explaining the accelerated expansion without a
cosmological constant. We achieve this by considering a phenomenological
extension to general relativity, modifying Einstein's field equations such that
$G$ is a function of time, $G(t)$, and we preserve the geometrical consistency
(Bianchi identity) together with the usual conservation of energy by
introducing a new tensor field to the equations. In order to have concrete
expressions to compare with cosmological data, we posit additional properties
to this tensor field, in a way that it can be interpreted as a response of
spacetime to a variation of $G$. Namely, we require that the energy this tensor
represents is nonzero only when there is a time variation of $G$, and its
energy depends on the scale factor only because of its coupling to $G$ and the
matter and radiation energy densities. Focusing on the accelerated expansion
period, we use type Ia supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillation data to
determine the best fit of the cosmological parameters as well as the required
variation in the gravitational constant. As a result, we find that it is
possible to explain the accelerated expansion of the Universe with a variation
of $G$ and no cosmological constant. The obtained variation of $G$ stays under
10 \% of its current value in the investigated redshift range and it is
consistent with the local observations of $\dot{G}/G$.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Although their hierarchical organization
and local feature extraction are inspired by the structure of primate visual
systems, the lack of lateral connections in such architectures critically
distinguishes their analysis from biological object processing. The idea of
enriching CNNs with recurrent lateral connections of convolutional type has
been put into practice in recent years, in the form of learned recurrent
kernels with no geometrical constraints. In the present work, we introduce
biologically plausible lateral kernels encoding a notion of correlation between
the feedforward filters of a CNN: at each layer, the associated kernel acts as
a transition kernel on the space of activations. The lateral kernels are
defined in terms of the filters, thus providing a parameter-free approach to
assess the geometry of horizontal connections based on the feedforward
structure. We then test this new architecture, which we call KerCNN, on a
generalization task related to global shape analysis and pattern completion:
once trained for performing basic image classification, the network is
evaluated on corrupted testing images. The image perturbations examined are
designed to undermine the recognition of the images via local features, thus
requiring an integration of context information - which in biological vision is
critically linked to lateral connectivity. Our KerCNNs turn out to be far more
stable than CNNs and recurrent CNNs to such degradations, thus validating this
biologically inspired approach to reinforce object recognition under
challenging conditions.

wind in its X-ray spectrum when the source is in the high state. The wind
detection is statistically significant in most of the XMM-Newton observations,
with velocities ranging from 200 to 1000 km/s. Observed features in the iron K
band can be explained by both wind absorption or by a forest of iron emission
lines. However, we also detect nitrogen, oxygen and neon absorption lines at
the same systematic velocity in the high-resolution RGS grating spectra. The
wind must be launched from the accretion disc, and could be the progenitor of
the UV absorption features observed at comparable velocities, but the latter
likely originate at significantly larger distances from the compact object. We
find strong correlations between the ionisation level of the outflowing
material and the ionising luminosity as well as the super-orbital phase. If the
luminosity is driving the correlation, the wind could be launched by a
combination of Compton heating and radiation pressure. If instead the
super-orbital phase is the driver for the variations, the observations are
likely scanning the wind at different heights above the warped accretion disc.
If this is the case, we can estimate the wind mass outflow rate, corrected for
the limited launching solid angle, to be roughly 70% of the mass accretion
rate.

highly non-linear Josephson junction to a high impedance transmission line,
allowing large phase fluctuations across the junction. Consequently, the
resonance of the former acquires a relative frequency shift that is orders of

renormalization is non-linear and quantum. Remarkably, the junction transfers
its non-linearity to about 30 environmental modes, a striking back-action

many exciting prospects for longstanding quests such as the tailoring of

sheared with different shear rates using Lees-Edwards periodic boundary
conditions. The steady-state rheological properties and the effect of the shear
on the microstructure of the mixture are studied for different strengths of the
dipolar coupling, $\lambda$, among the DSS. We find that at large shear rates,
the mixture shows a shear-thinning behavior for all considered values of
$\lambda$. At low and intermediate values of $\lambda$, a crossover from
Newtonian to non-Newtonian behavior is observed as the rate of applied shear is
increased. In contrast, for large values of $\lambda$, such a crossover is not
observed within the range of shear rates considered. Also, the extent of the
non-Newtonian regime increases as $\lambda$ is increased. These features can be
understood via the shear-induced changes of the microstructure. In particular,
the LCs display a shear-induced isotropic-to-nematic transition at large shear
rates with a shear-rate dependent degree of nematic ordering. The DSS show a
shear-induced nematic ordering only for large values of $\lambda$, where the
particles self-assemble into chains. Moreover, at large $\lambda$ and low shear
rates, our simulations indicate that the DSS form ferromagnetic domains.

space telescopes such as CoRoT, Kepler and TESS for determining stellar
rotation periods. While rotation periods of active stars can be reliably
determined, the light curves of many older and less active stars (e.g. stars
similar to the Sun) are quite irregular, which hampers determination of their
periods.
  Aims. We examine the factors causing the irregularities in stellar brightness
variations and develop a method for determining rotation periods of low
activity stars with irregular light curves.
  Methods. We extend the Spectral And Total Irradiance Reconstruction (SATIRE)
approach for modelling solar brightness variations to Sun-like stars. We
calculate the power spectra of stellar brightness variations for various
combinations of parameters defining the surface configuration and evolution of
stellar magnetic features.
  Results. The short lifetime of spots in comparison to the stellar rotation
period as well as the interplay between spot and facular contributions to
brightness variations of stars with near solar activity cause irregularities in
their light curves. The power spectra of such stars often lack a peak
associated with the rotation period. Nevertheless, the rotation period can
still be determined by measuring the period where the concavity of the power
spectrum plotted in the log-log scale changes sign, i.e. by identifying the
position of the inflection point.
  Conclusions. The inflection point of the (log-log) power spectrum is found to
be a new diagnostic for stellar rotation periods that is shown to work even in
cases where the power spectrum shows no peak at the rotation rate.

formally-correct synthesis, robust model predictive control, set-based

name but a few. In many of these applications, one requires to compute a
reachable set starting within a previously computed reachable set. While it was
previously required to re-compute the entire reachable set, we demonstrate that
one can leverage the dependencies of states within the previously computed set.
As a result, we almost instantly obtain an over-approximative subset of a
previously computed reachable set by evaluating analytical maps. The advantages
of our novel method are demonstrated for falsification of systems, optimization
over reachable sets, and synthesizing safe maneuver automata. In all of these
applications, the computation time is reduced significantly.

simulates intrinsic FRB populations and the surveys that find them, to produce
virtual observed populations. These resulting populations can then be compared
with real data, allowing constrains to be placed on underlying physics and
selection effects. We are able to replicate real Parkes and ASKAP FRB surveys,
in terms of both detection rates and distributions observed. We also show the
effect of beam patterns on the observed dispersion measure (DM) distributions.
We compare four types of source models. The ""Complex"" model, featuring a range

Fourier samples for the same underlying scene. Image recovery techniques from
MMVs aim to exploit the joint sparsity across the measurements in the sparse
domain. This is typically accomplished by extending the use of $\ell_1$
regularization of the sparse domain in the single measurement vector (SMV) case
to using $\ell_{2,1}$ regularization so that the ""jointness"" can be accounted
for. Although effective, the approach is inherently coupled and therefore
computationally inefficient. The method also does not consider current
approaches in the SMV case that use spatially varying weighted $\ell_1$
regularization term. The recently introduced variance based joint sparsity
(VBJS) recovery method uses the variance across the measurements in the sparse
domain to produce a weighted MMV method that is more accurate and more
efficient than the standard $\ell_{2,1}$ approach. The efficiency is due to the
decoupling of the measurement vectors, with the increased accuracy resulting
from the spatially varying weight. This paper introduces the accelerated VBJS
which reduces computational cost even further by eliminating the requirement to
first approximate the underlying image in order to construct the weights.
Eliminating this preprocessing step moreover reduces the amount of information
lost from the data, so that our method is more accurate. Numerical examples
provided in the paper verify these benefits.

true of problems posed in curved domains of arbitrary shape. In the case of

  Learning with Function Approximation",,,,,"cs.LG math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reinforcement learning, mathematically described by Markov Decision Problems,
may be approached either through dynamic programming or policy search.
Actor-critic algorithms combine the merits of both approaches by alternating
between steps to estimate the value function and policy gradient updates. Due
to the fact that the updates exhibit correlated noise and biased gradient
updates, only the asymptotic behavior of actor-critic is known by connecting
its behavior to dynamical systems. This work puts forth a new variant of
actor-critic that employs Monte Carlo rollouts during the policy search
updates, which results in controllable bias that depends on the number of
critic evaluations. As a result, we are able to provide for the first time the
convergence rate of actor-critic algorithms when the policy search step employs
policy gradient, agnostic to the choice of policy evaluation technique. In
particular, we establish conditions under which the sample complexity is
comparable to stochastic gradient method for non-convex problems or slower as a
result of the critic estimation error, which is the main complexity bottleneck.
These results hold in continuous state and action spaces with linear function
approximation for the value function. We then specialize these conceptual
results to the case where the critic is estimated by Temporal Difference,
Gradient Temporal Difference, and Accelerated Gradient Temporal Difference.
These learning rates are then corroborated on a navigation problem involving an
obstacle and the pendulum problem which provide insight into the interplay
between optimization and generalization in reinforcement learning.

several, often conflicting objectives. Many of these multi-objective
optimization problems are characterized by wide ranges of uncertainties in
their decision variables or objective functions, which further increases the
complexity of optimization. To cope with such uncertainties, robust
optimization is widely studied aiming to distinguish candidate solutions with
uncertain objectives specified by confidence intervals, probability
distributions or sampled data. However, existing techniques mostly either fail
to consider the actual distributions or assume uncertainty as instances of
uniform or Gaussian distributions. This paper introduces an empirical approach
that enables an efficient comparison of candidate solutions with uncertain
objectives that can follow arbitrary distributions. Given two candidate
solutions under comparison, this operator calculates the probability that one
solution dominates the other in terms of each uncertain objective. It can
substitute for the standard comparison operator of existing optimization
techniques such as evolutionary algorithms to enable discovering robust
solutions to problems with multiple uncertain objectives. This paper also
proposes to incorporate various uncertainties in well-known multi-objective
problems to provide a benchmark for evaluating uncertainty-aware optimization
techniques. The proposed comparison operator and benchmark suite are integrated
into an existing optimization tool that features a selection of multi-objective
optimization problems and algorithms. Experiments show that in comparison with
existing techniques, the proposed approach achieves higher optimization quality

very general unification modulo user-definable equational theories, and (ii)
symbolic reachability analysis of concurrent systems using narrowing. The paper
does not focus just on symbolic features: it also describes several other new
Maude features, including: (iii) Maude's strategy language for controlling
rewriting, and (iv) external objects that allow flexible interaction of Maude
object-based concurrent systems with the external world. In particular,
meta-interpreters are external objects encapsulating Maude interpreters that
can interact with many other objects. To make the paper self-contained and give
a reasonably complete language overview, we also review the basic Maude
features for equational rewriting and rewriting with rules, Maude programming
of concurrent object systems, and reflection. Furthermore, we include many
examples illustrating all the Maude notions and features described in the
paper.

and the photons that ultimately reach the observer are generated predominantly
inside and downstream of the shock. Predicting the observed spectrum requires
detailed calculations of the shock structure and thermodynamic state that
account properly for the shock microphysics. We present results of
self-consistent Monte-Carlo simulations of photon-starved RMS, that yield the
shock structure and emission for a broad range of shock velocities, from
sub-relativistic ($\beta_{sh} = 0.1$) to highly relativistic ($\Gamma_{sh} =
20$). Our simulations confirm that in relativistic RMS the immediate downstream
temperature is regulated by exponential pair creation, ranging from $50$ keV at
$\beta_{sh}=0.5$ to $200$ keV at $\Gamma_{sh}=20$. At lower velocities the
temperature becomes sensitive to the shock velocity, with $kT\sim 0.5$ keV at
$\beta_{sh}=0.1$. We also confirm that in relativistic shocks the opacity is
completely dominated by newly created pairs, which has important implications
for the breakout physics. We find the transition to pair dominance to occur at
$\beta_{sh}=0.5$ roughly. In all cases examined, the spectrum below the $\nu
F_\nu$ peak has been found to be substantially softer than the Planck
distribution. This has important implications for the optical emission in fast

are sensitive to noise. To solve these problems, in this paper, we first
analyze the features of noise. Then according to the statistical features of
noise, we propose a novel centroid update approach to enhance the robustness of
clustering-based superpixel methods. Besides, we propose a novel
superpixel-based edge detection method. The experiments on BSD500 dataset show
that our approach can significantly enhance the performance of clustering-based
superpixel methods in noisy environment. Moreover, we also show that our
proposed edge detection method outperforms other classical methods.

is more robust against labelling subjectivity. It also resorts to polyphonic
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to deliver more global insight
into system performance than F1-scores, and proposes a reduction of these
curves into a single polyphonic sound detection score (PSDS), which allows
system comparison independently from operating points (OPs). The presented
method also delivers better insight into data biases and classification
stability across sound classes. Furthermore, it can be tuned to varying
applications in order to match a variety of user experience requirements. The
benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by re-evaluating the

increasing its efficiency. In this work we study the effects of reduced

predictive control (MPC) design applicable to linear parameter-varying (LPV)
systems. In a heterogeneous tube, the parameterizations of the tube cross
sections and the associated control laws are allowed to vary along the
prediction horizon. Two extreme cases that can be described in this framework
are scenario MPC (high complexity, larger domain of attraction) and homothetic
tube MPC with a simple time-invariant control parameterization (low complexity,
smaller domain of attraction). In the proposed framework, these extreme
parameterizations, as well as other parameterizations of intermediate
complexity, can be combined within a single tube. By allowing for more
flexibility in the parameterization design, one can influence the trade-off
between computational cost and the size of the domain of attraction. Sufficient
conditions on the parameterization structure are developed under which
recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability are guaranteed. A specific
parameterization that combines the principles of scenario and homothetic tube
MPC is proposed and it is shown to satisfy the required conditions. The
properties of the approach, including its capability of achieving improved
complexity/performance trade-offs, are demonstrated using two numerical
examples.

development of independent consensus protocols that are not needed to be
homogeneous in the bi-limit. This proposal offers extra degrees of freedom to
implement consensus algorithms with enhanced convergence features, such as
reducing the gap between the real convergence moment and the upper bound chosen
by the user. We present two classes of fixed-time consensus protocols for
dynamic networks, consisting of nodes with first-order dynamics, and provide
sufficient conditions to set the upper bound for convergence a priori as a
consensus protocol parameter. The first protocol converges to the average value
of the initial condition of the nodes, even when switching among dynamic
networks. Unlike the first protocol, which requires, at each instant, an
evaluation of the non-linear predefined time-consensus function, hereinafter
introduced, per neighbor, the second protocol requires only a single evaluation
and ensures a predefined time-consensus for static topologies and fixed-time
convergence for dynamic networks. Predefined-time convergence is proved using
Lyapunov analysis, and simulations are carried out to illustrate the
performance of the suggested techniques. The exposed results have been applied

orbitals (LCAO) methods to describe the electronic structure of arrays of
acceptors, where the underlying basis states are derived from an
effective-mass-theory solution for a single acceptor in either the spherical
approximation or the cubic model. Our model allows for arbitrarily strong
spin-orbit coupling in the valence band of the semiconductor. We have studied
pairs and dimerised linear chains of acceptors in silicon in the
`independent-hole' approximation, and investigated the conditions for the
existence of topological edge states in the chains. For the finite chain we
find a complex interplay between electrostatic effects and the dimerisation,
with the long-range Coulomb attraction of the hole to the acceptors splitting
off states localised at the end acceptors from the rest of the chain. A further
pair of states then splits off from each band, to form a pair localised on the
next-to-end acceptors, for one sense of the bond alternation and merges into
the bulk bands for the other sense of the alternation. We confirm the
topologically non-trivial nature of these next-to-end localised states by
calculating the Zak phase. We argue that for the more physically accessible
case of one hole per acceptor these long-range electrostatic effects will be
screened out; we show this by treating a simple phenomenologically screened
model in which electrostatic contributions from beyond the nearest neighbours
of acceptor each pair are removed. Topological states are now found on the end
acceptors of the chains. In some cases the termination of the chain required to
produce topological states is not the one expected on the basis of simple
geometry (short versus long bonds); we argue this is because of a non-monotonic
relationship between the bond length and the effective Hamiltonian matrix
elements between the acceptors.

the light curves of both solar and stellar flares. However, their
quasi-periodic nature, along with the fact that they can be small in amplitude
and short-lived, makes QPPs difficult to unequivocally detect. In this paper,
we test the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art methods for detecting
QPPs using a series of hare-and-hounds exercises. The hare simulated a set of
flares, both with and without QPPs of a variety of forms, while the hounds
attempted to detect QPPs in blind tests. We use the results of these exercises
to create a blueprint for anyone who wishes to detect QPPs in real solar and
stellar data. We present eight clear recommendations to be kept in mind for
future QPP detections, with the plethora of solar and stellar flare data from
new and future satellites. These recommendations address the key pitfalls in
QPP detection, including detrending, trimming data, accounting for colored
noise, detecting stationary-period QPPs, detecting QPPs with nonstationary
periods, and ensuring that detections are robust and false detections are
minimized. We find that QPPs can be detected reliably and robustly by a variety

the entanglement entropy of a subsystem can be resolved into a sum of
contributions from different sectors of the subsystem's reduced density matrix,
each sector corresponding to a possible value of the conserved quantity. Recent
studies have discussed the basic properties of these symmetry-resolved
contributions, and calculated them using conformal field theory and numerical
methods. In this work we employ the generalized Fisher-Hartwig conjecture to
obtain exact results for the characteristic function of the symmetry-resolved
entanglement (""flux-resolved entanglement"") for certain 1D spin chains, or,
equivalently, the 1D fermionic tight binding and the Kitaev chain models. These
results are true up to corrections of order $o(L^{-1})$ where $L$ is the
subsystem size. We confirm that this calculation is in good agreement with
numerical results. For the gapless tight binding chain we report an intriguing
periodic structure of the characteristic functions, which nicely extends the
structure predicted by conformal field theory. For the Kitaev chain in the
topological phase we demonstrate the degeneracy between the even and odd
fermion parity sectors of the entanglement spectrum due to virtual Majoranas at
the entanglement cut. We also employ the Widom conjecture to obtain the leading
behavior of the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy in higher dimensions for
an ungapped free Fermi gas in its ground state.

Unfortunately, such algorithms typically struggle to scale to high-dimensional
problems, in part because the calculation of specific preconditioners such as
the inverse Hessian or Fisher information matrix is highly expensive. We
introduce first-order preconditioning (FOP), a fast, scalable approach that
generalizes previous work on hypergradient descent (Almeida et al., 1998;
Maclaurin et al., 2015; Baydin et al.,2017) to learn a preconditioning matrix

overhead. We also investigate the properties of the learned preconditioning

devise a way to explicitly incorporate physical dimension into geometric
mechanics.
  A historical account of metrology and phase space is given to illustrate the
disconnect between the theoretical physical models in use today and the formal
treatment of units of measurement. Self-contained presentations of local Lie
algebras, Lie algebroids, Poisson manifolds, line bundles and Jacobi manifolds
are given. A unit-free manifold is defined as a generic line bundle over a
smooth manifold that we interpret as a manifold whose ring of functions no
longer has a preferred choice of a unit. This point of view allows us to
implement physical dimension into geometric mechanics.
  Unit-free manifolds are shown to share many of the core structure of the
category of ordinary smooth manifolds: Cartesian products, derivations as
tangent vectors, jets as cotangent vectors, submanifolds and quotients. This
allows to reinterpret the notion of Jacobi manifold as the unit-free analogue
of Poisson manifolds. With this new language we rediscover known results about
Jacobi maps, coisotropic submanifolds, Jacobi products and Jacobi reduction.
  We give a categorical formulation of the loose term 'canonical Hamiltonian
mechanics' by defining the notions of theory of phase spaces and Hamiltonian
functor. Conventional configuration spaces are then replaced by line bundles,
called unit-free configuration spaces, and, they are shown to fit into a theory
of phase spaces with a Hamiltonian functor given by the jet functor.
  Motivated by the algebraic structure of physical quantities in dimensional
analysis, we define dimensioned groups, rings, modules and algebras by
implementing an addition operation that is partially defined. Jacobi manfolds
are shown to have associated dimensioned Poisson algebras and dimensioned
coisotropic calculus.

advantage of all the data that are available to that point. Conventional
intuition suggests that when solving a sequence of related optimization
problems of this form, it should be possible to initialize using the solution

initialize from scratch -- and see reductions in wall-clock time. However, in
practice this warm-starting seems to yield poorer generalization performance
than models that have fresh random initializations, even though the final

allow a practitioner to close this generalization gap, they seem to only do so

polymorphic blame calculus for row types and row polymorphism. In our blame
calculus, casts perform not only run-time checking with the dynamic row type
but also field reordering in row types. To simplify our technical development
for row polymorphism, we adopt scoped labels, which are employed by the
language Koka and are also emerging in the context of effect systems. We give
the formal definition of our blame calculus with these technical developments
and prove its type soundness. We also sketch the gradually typed surface
language and type-preserving translation from the surface language to the blame
calculus and discuss conservativity of the surface language over typing of a
statically typed language with row types and row polymorphism.

$\mathbb{C}$ which includes the region $\{$Re$(s) >-b$, $|$Im $(s)|> K\}$ for
any $b>0$ and some $K=K(b) \gg 1$. As a corollary we establish the
meromorphicity of the scattering resolvent in a sector $|$arg$(s)| <\varphi_0$

quasinormal frequencies according to our definition. This result applies in
situations where the method of complex scaling cannot be directly applied, as
our potentials need not be analytic. Finally, we show that QNFs computed by the
continued fraction method of Leaver are necessarily QNFs according to our new

practical issues to various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) powered
applications. Most existing physical adversarial attack defense works only
focus on eliminating explicit perturbation patterns from inputs, ignoring
interpretation to CNN's intrinsic vulnerability. Therefore, they lack the
expected versatility to different attacks and thereby depend on considerable
data processing costs. In this paper, we propose LanCe -- a comprehensive and
lightweight CNN defense methodology against different physical adversarial
attacks. By interpreting CNN's vulnerability, we find that non-semantic
adversarial perturbations can activate CNN with significantly abnormal
activations and even overwhelm other semantic input patterns' activations. We
improve the CNN recognition process by adding a self-verification stage to
detect the potential adversarial input with only one CNN inference cost. Based
on the detection result, we further propose a data recovery methodology to
defend the physical adversarial attacks. We apply such defense methodology into
both image and audio CNN recognition scenarios and analyze the computational
complexity for each scenario, respectively. Experiments show that our
methodology can achieve an average 91% successful rate for attack detection and
89% accuracy recovery. Moreover, it is at most 3x faster compared with the
state-of-the-art defense methods, making it feasible to resource-constrained

Features Constraint (LPFC) is used and then a multi-scale selection strategy is
introduced. The LPEC can be used in a single-scale point network architecture
for a more stable normal estimation of the unstructured 3D point clouds. In
particular, it can partly overcome the influence of noise on a large sampling
scale compared to the other methods which only use regression loss for normal
estimation. For more details, a subnetwork is built after point-wise features
extracted layers of the network and it gives more constraints to each point of
the local patch via a binary classifier in the end. Then we use multi-task
optimization to train the normal estimation and local plane classification
tasks simultaneously.Also, to integrate the advantages of multi-scale results,
a scale selection strategy is adopted, which is a data-driven approach for
selecting the optimal scale around each point and encourages subnetwork
specialization. Specifically, we employed a subnetwork called Scale Estimation
Network to extract scale weight information from multi-scale features. More
analysis is given about the relations between noise levels, local boundary, and
scales in the experiment. These relationships can be a better guide to choosing
particular scales for a particular model. Besides, the experimental result
shows that our network can distinguish the points on the fitting plane
accurately and this can be used to guide the normal estimation and our
multi-scale method can improve the results well. Compared to some

Triple-GAN, which aims to jointly optimize model components by incorporating

this paper, IRSs with low-resolution phase shifters are considered. We aim to
maximize the receive signal power at the user by jointly optimizing discrete
phase shifts of IRSs and the transmit beamforming vector at the base station
for mmWave downlink systems. An analytical near-optimal solution is developed
by exploiting some important characteristics of mmWave channels. Our
theoretical analysis reveals that low-resolution phase shifters can still
achieve a receive signal power that increases quadratically with the number of
reflecting elements. Simulation results are provided to corroborate our

photonic qubit, whose two logic states are represented by the vacuum state and
the single photon state of a single cavity mode, respectively. During the gate
operation, the qutrit remains in the ground state and thus decoherence from the

performance on certain tasks like link-prediction. However, such heuristic
models of context are fundamentally different to how humans capture
information. For instance, when reading a multi-modal webpage (i) humans do not
perceive all parts of a document equally: Some words and parts of images are
skipped, others are revisited several times which makes the perception trace
highly non-sequential; (ii) humans construct meaning from a document's content
by shifting their attention between text and image, among other things, guided
by layout and design elements. In this paper we empirically investigate the
difference between human perception and context heuristics of basic embedding
models. We conduct eye tracking experiments to capture the underlying
characteristics of human perception of media documents containing a mixture of
text and images. Based on that, we devise a prototypical computational
perception-trace model, called CMPM. We evaluate empirically how CMPM can
improve a basic skip-gram embedding approach. Our results suggest, that even
with a basic human-inspired computational perception model, there is a huge
potential for improving embeddings since such a model does inherently capture

(1-D(G(z, y)))]$. An approximate solution can be found by training
simultaneously two neural networks to model D and G and feeding G with a random
noise vector $z$. After training, we have that $G(z, y)\mathrel{\dot\sim}
p_{data}(x, y)$. By fixing $y$, we have $G(z|y) \mathrel{\dot\sim}
p{data}(x|y)$. By sampling $z$, we can therefore obtain samples following
approximately $p(x|y)$, which is the predictive distribution of $x$ for a new
$y$. We ran experiments to test various loss functions, data distributions,
sample size, size of the noise vector, etc. Even if we observed differences, no
experiment outperformed consistently the others. The quality of CGAN for
regression relies on fine-tuning a range of hyperparameters. In a broader view,
the results show that CGANs are very promising methods to perform uncertainty
estimation for high dimensional non-linear regression.

patients later on in life whereas the less common Type 1 diabetes is diagnosed
early on in life. People can live healthy and happy lives while living with
diabetes, but early detection produces a better overall outcome on most
patient's health. Thus, to test the accurate prediction of Type 2 diabetes, we
use the patients' information from an electronic health records company called
Practice Fusion, which has about 10,000 patient records from 2009 to 2012. This
data contains individual key biometrics, including age, diastolic and systolic
blood pressure, gender, height, and weight. We use this data on popular machine
learning algorithms and for each algorithm, we evaluate the performance of
every model based on their classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity,
specificity/recall, negative predictive value, and F1 score. In our study, we
find that all algorithms other than Naive Bayes suffered from very low
precision. Hence, we take a step further and incorporate all the algorithms
into a weighted average or soft voting ensemble model where each algorithm will
count towards a majority vote towards the decision outcome of whether a patient
has diabetes or not. The accuracy of the Ensemble model on Practice Fusion is
85\%, by far our ensemble approach is new in this space. We firmly believe that
the weighted average ensemble model not only performed well in overall metrics

Type 2 diabetes. Our accurate novel model can be used as an alert for the

explicitly intended for binary, not valued, networks. The underlying dilemma is
how empirical valued blocks can be compared with ideal binary blocks, an
intrinsic problem in the direct approach where partitions are solely determined

been dichotomized into binary versions, or novel types of ideal valued blocks
have been introduced. Both these workarounds are problematic in terms of
interpretability, unwanted data reduction, and the often arbitrary setting of
model parameters.
  This paper proposes a direct blockmodeling approach that effectively bypasses
the dilemma with blockmodeling of valued networks. By introducing an adaptive
weighted correlation-based criteria function, the proposed approach is directly
applicable to both binary and valued networks, without any form of
dichotomization or transformation of the valued (or binary) data at any point
in the analysis, while still using the conventional set of ideal binary blocks
from structural, regular and generalized blockmodeling.
  The approach is demonstrated by structural, regular and generalized
blockmodeling applications of six classical binary and valued networks. Finding
feasible and intuitive optimal solutions in both the binary and valued
examples, the approach is proposed not only as a practical,
dichotomization-free heuristic for blockmodeling of valued networks but also,
through its additional benefits, as an alternative to the conventional direct
approach to blockmodeling.

Many sources of uncertainty lie in the real-world problems. Telemac as any
model (i.e. approximation of reality) is error prone since uncertainties appear
in the initial or boundary conditions, the system parameters, the modelling
simplification or the numerical calculations themselves. Therefore, it is
difficult to say with confidence if the design of a Telemac model has met all
the requirements to be optimal. Calibration consists of tuning the model
parameters so that the results are in better agreement with a set of
observations. This phase is crucial before any further study can be conducted
by avoiding a meaningless analysis or prediction based on false or too
inaccurate results. This paper presents a statistical calibration of a Telemac
2D model (Gironde Estuary in France) with the learning of Telemac errors by a
metamodel (i.e. a model of the simulation errors) to make the best use of
limited observations data over a short time period. The metamodel here is a
simplified version of Telemac behaving the same for all the locations where
observation points are available. If the metamodel is correct, it will be able
to compute as Telemac would do but with a highly reduced computational cost.

phase gate with one cat-state qubit (\textit{cqubit}) simultaneously

\textit{cqubit} are represented by two orthogonal cat states of a single cavity
mode. In this proposal, the gate is implemented with $n$ microwave cavities
coupled to a superconducting transmon qutrit. Because the qutrit remains in the
ground state during the gate operation, decoherence caused due to the qutrit's
energy relaxation and dephasing is greatly suppressed. The gate implementation
is quite simple because only a single-step operation is needed and neither
classical pulse nor measurement is required. Numerical simulations demonstrate
that high-fidelity realization of a controlled phase gate with one cqubit
simultaneously controlling two target cqubits is feasible with present circuit
QED technology. This proposal can be extended to a wide range of physical
systems to realize the proposed gate, such as multiple microwave or optical
cavities coupled to a natural or artificial three-level atom.

wake of slip fronts propagating along their surfaces in contact. This
macroscopic rupture dynamics can be successfully mapped on the elastodynamics
of a moving shear crack. However, this analogy breaks down during the
nucleation process, which develops at the scale of surface asperities where
microcontacts form. Recent atomistic simulations revealed how a characteristic
junction size selects if the failure of microcontact junctions either arises by
brittle fracture or by ductile yielding. This work aims at bridging these two
complementary descriptions of the onset of frictional slip existing at
different scales. We first present how the microcontacts failure observed in
atomistic simulations can be conveniently ""coarse-grained"" using an equivalent
cohesive law. Taking advantage of a scalable parallel implementation of the
cohesive element method, we study how the different failure mechanisms of the
microcontact asperities interplay with the nucleation and propagation of
macroscopic slip fronts along the interface. Notably, large simulations reveal
how the failure mechanism prevailing in the rupture of the microcontacts
(brittle versus ductile) significantly impacts the nucleation of frictional
sliding and, thereby, the interface frictional strength. This work paves the
way for a unified description of frictional interfaces connecting the recent
advances independently made at the micro- and macroscopic scales.

The success of
a television show in an increasingly technological society is a vast
multi-variable formula. The art of success is not just something that happens,
but is studied, replicated, and applied. Hollywood can be unpredictable
regarding success, as many movies and sitcoms that are hyped up and promise to
be a hit end up being box office failures and complete disappointments. In
current studies, linguistic exploration is being performed on the relationship
between Television series and target community of viewers. Having a decision
support system that can display sound and predictable results would be needed
to build confidence in the investment of a new TV series. The models presented
in this study use data to study and determine what makes a sitcom successful.
In this paper, we use descriptive and predictive modeling techniques to assess
the continuing success of television comedies: The Office, Big Bang Theory,
Arrested Development, Scrubs, and South Park. The factors that are tested for
statistical significance on episode ratings are character presence, director,
and writer. These statistics show that while characters are indeed crucial to
the shows themselves, the creation and direction of the shows pose implication
upon the ratings and therefore the success of the shows. We use machine
learning based forecasting models to accurately predict the success of shows.
The models represent a baseline to understanding the success of a television
show and how producers can increase the success of current television shows or
utilize this data in the creation of future shows. Due to the many factors that
go into a series, the empirical analysis in this work shows that there is no
one-fits-all model to forecast the rating or success of a television show.

time window and synchronization constraints. In this problem, the fleet of
vehicles is categorized into regular and special vehicles. Some customers
require both vehicles' services, whose starting service times at the customer
are synchronized. Despite its important real-world application, this problem
has rarely been studied in the literature. To solve the problem, we propose a
Constraint Programming (CP) model and an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search
(ALNS) in which the design of insertion operators is based on solving linear
programming (LP) models to check the insertion feasibility. A number of
acceleration techniques is also proposed to significantly reduce the
computational time. The computational experiments show that our new CP model
finds better solutions than an existing CP-based ANLS, when used on small
instances with 25 customers and with a much shorter running time. Our LP-based
ALNS dominates the cp-ALNS, in terms of solution quality, when it provides
solutions with better objective values, on average, for all instance classes.
This demonstrates the advantage of using linear programming instead of
constraint programming when dealing with a variant of vehicle routing problems
with relatively tight constraints, which is often considered to be more
favorable for CP-based methods.
