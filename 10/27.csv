pretraining languages to achieve fast adaptation on unseen target language, via
recently proposed model-agnostic meta learning algorithm (MAML). We evaluated
the proposed approach using six languages as pretraining tasks and four
languages as target tasks. Preliminary results showed that the proposed method,
MetaASR, significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art multitask pretraining
approach on all target languages with different combinations of pretraining

opens new research direction of applying meta learning to more speech-related
applications.

it difficult for state-of-the-art facial landmark detection algorithms to yield
good results. In this paper, we propose a framework named FAB that takes
advantage of structure consistency in the temporal dimension for facial
landmark detection in motion-blurred videos. A structure predictor is proposed
to predict the missing face structural information temporally, which serves as
a geometry prior. This allows our framework to work as a virtuous circle. On
one hand, the geometry prior helps our structure-aware deblurring network
generates high quality deblurred images which lead to better landmark detection
results. On the other hand, better landmark detection results help structure
predictor generate better geometry prior for the next frame. Moreover, it is a
flexible video-based framework that can incorporate any static image-based
methods to provide a performance boost on video datasets. Extensive experiments
on Blurred-300VW, the proposed Real-world Motion Blur (RWMB) datasets and 300VW
demonstrate the superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods. Datasets

of Frame theory are presented for Newtonian cosmological dust matter expressed

Of particular interest is the second-largest Lyapunov exponent, $\lambda_2$,

We prove a generalized Perron-Frobenius theorem for cocycles of bounded linear
operators on Banach spaces that preserve and occasionally contract a cone; this
theorem shows that the top Oseledets space for the cocycle is one-dimensional,
and there is an readily computed lower bound for the gap between the largest

Lasota-Yorke inequality. We also examine random perturbations of a fixed map

down to the unperturbed map, $\lambda_2$ is asymptotically linear in the scale
parameter. Our estimates are sharp, in the sense that there is a sequence of
scaled perturbations of the fixed map that are all Markov, such that

extrapolation of the hard X-ray spectral continuum model - is a very common
feature among type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN); yet the nature of the soft
X-ray excess is still poorly understood and hotly debated. To shed some light
on this issue, we have measured in a model-independent way the soft excess
strength in a flux-limited sample of broad-line and narrow-line Seyfert 1
galaxies (BLS1s and NLS1s) that are matched in X-ray luminosity but different
in terms of the black hole mass and the accretion rate values, with NLS1s being
characterized by smaller MBH and larger accretion rate values. Our analysis, in
agreement with previous studies carried out with different AGN samples,
indicates that: 1) a soft excess is ubiquitously detected in both BLS1s and
NLS1s; 2) the strength of the soft excess is significantly larger in the NLS1
sample, compared to the BLS1 sample; 3) combining the two samples, the strength
of the soft excess appears to positively correlate with the photon index as
well as with the accretion rate, whereas there is no correlation with the black
hole mass. Importantly, our work also reveals the lack of an anticorrelation
between the soft excess strength and the luminosity of the primary X-ray
component, predicted by the absorption and reflection scenarios. Our findings
suggest that the soft excess is consistent with being produced by a warm
Comptonization component. Larger, more complete samples of NLS1s and BLS1s are
needed to confirm these conclusions.

they appear in the blowup study of sets that have finite sub-Riemannian
perimeter. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, we prove some mild
regularity and structural results in arbitrary Carnot groups. Namely, we show
that for every constant-normal set in a Carnot group its
sub-Riemannian-Lebesgue representative is regularly open, contractible, and its
topological boundary coincides with the reduced boundary and with the
measure-theoretic boundary. We infer these properties from a cone property.
Such a cone will be a semisubgroup with nonempty interior that is canonically
associated with the normal direction. We characterize the constant-normal sets
exactly as those that are arbitrary unions of translations of such
semisubgroups. Second, making use of such a characterization, we provide some
pathological examples in the specific case of the free-Carnot group of step 3
and rank 2. Namely, we construct a constant normal set that, with respect to
any Riemannian metric, is not of locally finite perimeter; we also construct an
example with non-unique intrinsic blowup at some point, showing that it has
different upper and lower sub-Riemannian density at the origin. Third, we show
that in Carnot groups of step 4 or less, every constant-normal set is
intrinsically rectifiable, in the sense of Franchi, Serapioni, and Serra
Cassano.

has also an important role in the development of quantum mechanics. Its
conceptual framework results from the advantages of transformation theory and,
for this reason, relates to the features of the generating function of
canonical transformations connecting a specific Hamiltonian H to a new
Hamiltonian K chosen to simplify Hamilton's equations of motion. Usually, the
choice is between K=0 and a cyclic K depending on the new conjugate momenta
only. Here, we investigate more general representations of the new Hamiltonian.
Furthermore, it is pointed out that the two common alternatives of K=0 and a
cyclic K should be distinguished in more detail. An attempt is made to clearly
discern the two regimes for the harmonic oscillator and, not surprisingly, some
correspondences to the quantum harmonic oscillator appear. Thanks to this
preparatory work, generalized coordinates and momenta associated with the
Hamilton's principal function S (i.e., K=0) are used to determine dependences
in the Hamilton's characteristic function W (i.e., cyclic K). The procedure
leads to the Schrodinger's equation where the Hamilton's characteristic
function plays the role of the Schrodinger's wave function, whereas the first
integral invariant of Poincare' takes the place of the reduced Planck constant.
This finding advances the pedagogical value of the Hamilton-Jacobi theory in
view of an introduction to Schrodinger's wave mechanics without the tools of
quantum mechanics.

on a novel frequency-domain factor model that provides a flexible yet
parsimonious representation of spectral matrices from a large number of

loading matrices are modeled independently using a prior that is formulated
from the tensor product of penalized splines and multiplicative gamma process
shrinkage priors, allowing for infinitely many factors with loadings
increasingly shrunk towards zero as the column index increases. Formulated in a
fully Bayesian framework, the time series is adaptively partitioned into
approximately stationary segments, where both the number and location of
partition points are assumed unknown. Stochastic approximation Monte Carlo
(SAMC) techniques are used to accommodate the unknown number of segments, and a
conditional Whittle likelihood-based Gibbs sampler is developed for efficient
sampling within segments. By averaging over the distribution of partitions, the
proposed method can approximate both abrupt and slowly varying changes in
spectral matrices. Performance of the proposed model is evaluated by extensive
simulations and demonstrated through the analysis of high-density

  Conference on Web and Internet Economics (WINE 2019)",,,,"econ.TH cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work deals with the implementation of social choice rules using dominant
strategies for unrestricted preferences. The seminal Gibbard-Satterthwaite
theorem shows that only few unappealing social choice rules can be implemented
unless we assume some restrictions on the preferences or allow monetary
transfers. When monetary transfers are allowed and quasi-linear utilities
w.r.t. money are assumed, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms were shown to
implement any affine-maximizer, and by the work of Roberts, only
affine-maximizers can be implemented whenever the type sets of the agents are
rich enough.
  In this work, we generalize these results and define a new class of
preferences: Preferences which are positive-represented by a quasi-linear
utility. That is, agents whose preference on a subspace of the outcomes can be
modeled using a quasi-linear utility. We show that the characterization of VCG
mechanisms as the incentive-compatible mechanisms extends naturally to this
domain. Our result follows from a simple reduction to the characterization of
VCG mechanisms. Hence, we see our result more as a fuller more correct version
of the VCG characterization.
  This work also highlights a common misconception in the community attributing
the VCG result to the usage of transferable utility. Our result shows that the
incentive-compatibility of the VCG mechanisms does not rely on money being a
common denominator, but rather on the ability of the designer to fine the
agents on a continuous (maybe agent-specific) scale.
  We think these two insights, considering the utility as a representation and
not as the preference itself (which is common in the economic community) and
considering utilities which represent the preference only for the relevant
domain, would turn out to fruitful in other domains as well.

consider a toy model of five dimensional pure gravity theory compactified on a
circle. The resulting four dimensional theory is a scalar-Maxwell theory which
is minimally coupled with gravity. By finding the equations of motion for
scalar, electric and magnetic fields , we would be able to find exact wave
solutions of coupled equations which are zero mode solutions. We also perform
perturbation in order to consider non-zero modes of electromagnetic fields .\\
Having these solutions at hand, we study the recombination of scalar-affected
electromagnetic waves (EWs) in a typical Michelson interferometer. In
particular , we obtain, up to to first order , the change of amplitude of
electromagnetic power due to presence of this scalar field which may reveal
some signals of extra dimension.

burned, and the process was captured with CMOS and CCD cameras. The resulting

combustion time, and flame stand-off (FSR) ratio data for the various crude

observed at a particle loading of 0.5% w/w acetylene black nanoparticles and
0.5% w/w multi-walled carbon nanotubes, respectively. Generally, FSR for pure

Markov processes evolving in discrete time, when the specification is given as
a B\""uchi condition (visit a set of states infinitely often). We decompose
computation of the maximal probability of satisfying the B\""uchi condition into
two steps. The first step is to compute the maximal qualitative winning set,
from where the B\""uchi condition can be enforced with probability one. The
second step is to find the maximal probability of reaching the already computed
qualitative winning set. In contrast with finite-state models, we show that
such a computation only gives a lower bound on the maximal probability where
the gap can be non-zero.
  In this paper we focus on approximating the qualitative winning set, while
pointing out that the existing approaches for unbounded reachability
computation can solve the second step. We provide an abstraction-based
technique to approximate the qualitative winning set by simultaneously using an
over- and under-approximation of the probabilistic transition relation. Since
we are interested in qualitative properties, the abstraction is
non-probabilistic; instead, the probabilistic transitions are assumed to be
under the control of a (fair) adversary. Thus, we reduce the original policy
synthesis problem to a B\""uchi game under a fairness assumption and
characterize upper and lower bounds on winning sets as nested fixed point
expressions in the $\mu$-calculus. This characterization immediately provides a
symbolic algorithm scheme. Further, a winning strategy computed on the abstract
game can be refined to a policy on the controlled Markov process.
  We describe a concrete abstraction procedure and demonstrate our algorithm on
two case studies.

dynamical systems (more precisely, paradigmatic examples of area-preserving

shown that, for larger parameter values for which the Lyapunov exponents are
largely positive over the entire phase space, the probability distribution is a
Gaussian, consistent with Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistics. On the other hand,
for smaller parameter values for which the Lyapunov exponents are virtually
zero over the entire phase space, we verify this distribution appears to
approach a $q$-Gaussian (with $q \simeq 1.935$), consistent with
$q$-statistics. Interestingly, if the parameter values are in between these two
extremes, then the probability distributions happen to exhibit a linear
combination of these two behaviours. Here, we numerically show that the Harper
map is also in the same universality class of the maps discussed so far. This
constitutes one more evidence on the robustness of this behavior whenever the
phase space consists of stable orbits. Then, we propose a generalization of the
standard map for which the phase space includes many sticky regions, changing
the previously observed simple linear combination behavior to a more complex
combination.

Virgo detectors to lose light resonance in one or more of their component optic
cavities, and the affected detector is unable to take data until resonance is
recovered. In this paper, we use machine learning techniques to gain insight
into the predictive behavior of the LIGO detector optic cavities during the
second LIGO-Virgo observing run. We identify a minimal set of optic cavity
control signals and data features which capture interferometer behavior leading
to a loss of light resonance, or lockloss. We use these channels to accurately
distinguish between lockloss events and quiet interferometer operating times
via both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. This analysis
yields new insights into how components of the LIGO detectors contribute to
lockloss events, which could inform detector commissioning efforts to mitigate
the associated loss of uptime. Particularly, we find that the state of the
component optical cavities is a better predictor of loss of lock than ground
motion trends. We report prediction accuracies of 98% for times just prior to
lock loss, and 90% for times up to 30 seconds prior to lockloss, which shows
promise for this method to be applied in near-real time to trigger preventative
detector state changes. This method can be extended to target other auxiliary
subsystems or times of interest, such as transient noise or loss in detector
sensitivity. Application of these techniques during the third LIGO-Virgo
observing run and beyond would maximize the potential of the global detector

processes relying on different catalytic systems. The increasing demand for
such systems requires rationalization of the use of their expensive components,
like noble metal catalysts. As such, a catalyst with low noble metal
concentration, in which each one of the noble atoms is active, would reach the
lowest price possible. Nevertheless, there are no reactivity descriptors
outlined for this type of low coordinated supported atoms. Using DFT
calculations, we consider three diverse systems as models of single atom
catalysts. We investigate monomers and bimetallic dimers of Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir and
Pt on MgO(001), Cu adatom on thin Mo(001)-supported films (NaF, MgO and ScN)
and single Pt adatoms on oxidized graphene surfaces. Reactivity of these metal
atoms was probed by CO. In each case we see the interaction through the
donation-backdonation mechanism. In some cases the CO adsorption energies can
be linked to the position of the d-band center and the charge of the adatom.
Higher positioned d-band center and less charged supported single atoms bind CO
weaker. Also, in some cases metal atoms less strongly bonded to the substrate
bind CO more strongly. The results suggest that the identification of common
activity descriptor(s) for single metal atoms on foreign supports is a
difficult task with no unique solution. However, it is also suggested that the
stability of adatoms and strong anchoring to the support are prerequisites for
the application of descriptor-based search for novel single atom catalysts.

a narrow range around a ""magic angle"", we observe correlated states over a
continuum of angles, spanning 4 degree to 5.1 degree. A Mott-like insulator
appears at half band filling that can be sensitively tuned with displacement
field. Hall measurements supported by ab initio calculations suggest that the
strength of the insulator is driven by the density of states at half filling,
consistent with a 2D Hubbard model in a regime of moderate interactions. At 5.1

question: Given a set of potential demonstrators, which among them is best
suited for teaching any particular learner? Prior work, such as the popular
Deep Q-learning from Demonstrations (DQfD) algorithm has generally focused on
single demonstrators. In this work we consider the problem of choosing among
multiple demonstrators of varying skill levels. Our results align with
intuition from human learners: it is not always the best policy to draw
demonstrations from the best performing demonstrator (in terms of reward). We
show that careful selection of teaching strategies can result in sample
efficiency gains in the learner's environment across nine Atari games

  This paper presents Silhouette: a compiler-based defense that efficiently
guarantees the integrity of return addresses, significantly reducing the attack
surface for control-flow hijacking. Silhouette combines an incorruptible shadow
stack for return addresses with checks on forward control flow and memory
protection to ensure that all functions return to the correct dynamic caller.
To protect its shadow stack, Silhouette uses store hardening, an efficient
intra-address space isolation technique targeting various ARM architectures
that leverages special store instructions found on ARM processors.
  We implemented Silhouette for the ARMv7-M architecture, but our techniques
are applicable to other common embedded ARM architectures. Our evaluation shows
that Silhouette incurs a geometric mean of 1.3% and 3.4% performance overhead
on two benchmark suites. Furthermore, we prototyped Silhouette-Invert, an
alternative implementation of Silhouette, which incurs just 0.3% and 1.9%

zeroth-order gradient descent (ZO-GD) or stochastic gradient descent (ZO-SGD).
In this paper, we propose a new algorithm ZO-SVRG-Coord-Rand and develop a new

life expectancy over the past century. Smoking accounts for a large part of the
nonlinearities in the growth of life expectancy and of the geographic and sex
differences in mortality. As Bongaarts (2006) and Janssen (2018) suggested,
accounting for smoking could improve the quality of mortality forecasts due to
the predictable nature of the smoking epidemic. We propose a new Bayesian

convert the forecast of the non-smoking life expectancy at birth (i.e., life
expectancy at birth removing the smoking effect) into life expectancy forecast
through the use of the age-specific smoking attributable fraction (ASSAF). We
introduce a new age-cohort model for the ASSAF and a Bayesian hierarchical
model for non-smoking life expectancy at birth. The forecast performance of the
proposed method is evaluated by out-of-sample validation compared with four
other commonly used methods for life expectancy forecasting. Improvements in

Lykouris and Vassilvitskii, the goal is to solve the caching problem with an
online algorithm that has access to next-arrival predictions: when each input
element arrives, the algorithm is given a prediction of the next time when the
element will reappear. The traditional model for online caching suffers from an
$\Omega(\log k)$ competitive ratio lower bound (on a cache of size $k$). In
contrast, the augmented model admits algorithms which beat this lower bound
when the predictions have low error, and asymptotically match the lower bound
when the predictions have high error, even if the algorithms are oblivious to
the prediction error. In particular, Lykouris and Vassilvitskii showed that
there is a prediction-augmented caching algorithm with a competitive ratio of
$O(1+\min(\sqrt{\eta/OPT}, \log k))$ when the overall $\ell_1$ prediction error
is bounded by $\eta$, and $OPT$ is the cost of the optimal offline algorithm.
  The dependence on $k$ in the competitive ratio is optimal, but the dependence
on $\eta/OPT$ may be far from optimal. In this work, we make progress towards
closing this gap. Our contributions are twofold. First, we provide an improved
algorithm with a competitive ratio of $O(1 + \min((\eta/OPT)/k, 1) \log k)$.
Second, we provide a lower bound of $\Omega(\log \min((\eta/OPT)/(k \log k),
k))$.

time-to-event (TTE) data with censoring, and also accounting for a toxicity
outcome. We model the association of TTE data with baseline covariates using a
semi-parametric failure time model with a P\'olya tree prior for an unknown
error term and a random forest for a flexible regression mean function. We
define a utility function that addresses a trade-off between efficacy and
toxicity as one of the important clinical considerations for population
finding. We examine the operating characteristics of the proposed method in
extensive simulation studies. For illustration, we apply the proposed method to
data from a randomized oncology clinical trial. Concerns in a preliminary
analysis of the same data based on a parametric model motivated the proposed
more general approach.

protocols over noisy channels. Haeupler [FOCS 2014] considered robust
simulation of two-party interactive protocols over oblivious, as well as
adaptive, noisy channels. Since the simulation does not need to have fixed
communication pattern, the achieved communication rates can circumvent the
lower bound proved by Kol and Raz [STOC 2013]. However, a drawback of this
approach is that each party needs to remember the whole history of the
simulated transcript. In a subsequent manuscript, Haeupler and Resch considered
low-memory simulation. The idea was to view the original protocol as a
computational DAG and only the identities of the nodes are saved (as opposed to
the whole transcript history) for backtracking to reduce memory usage.
  In this paper, we consider low-memory robust simulation of more general
client-server interactive protocols, in which a leader communicates with other
members/servers, who do not communicate among themselves; this setting can be
applied to information-theoretic multi-server Private Information Retrieval
(PIR) schemes. We propose an information-theoretic technique that converts any
correct PIR protocol that assumes reliable channels, into a protocol which is
both correct and private in the presence of a noisy channel while keeping the
space complexity to a minimum. Despite the huge attention that PIR protocols
have received in the literature, the existing works assume that the parties
communicate using noiseless channels.

Secondly, traditional text mining methods fail to effectively extract concepts

using the complementary knowledge-bases makes the results biased to the content

cycle-consistently towards the target. Second, we propose sub-domain
aggregation discriminator and cross-domain cycle discriminator to make
different adapted domains more closely aggregated. Finally, feature-level

beat-to-beat 3D image-based navigators (3D iNAVs) collected using a
variable-density cones trajectory with different combinations of spatial
resolutions and scan acceleration factors.
  Methods: Fully sampled, breath-held 4.4 mm 3D iNAV datasets for six
respiratory phases are acquired in a volunteer. Ground truth translational and
nonrigid motion information is derived from these datasets. Subsequently, the
motion estimates from synthesized undersampled 3D iNAVs with isotropic spatial
resolutions of 4.4 mm (acceleration factor = 10.9), 5.4 mm (acceleration factor
= 7.2), 6.4 mm (acceleration factor = 4.2), and 7.8 mm (acceleration factor =
2.9) are assessed against the ground truth information. The undersampled 3D
iNAV configuration with the highest accuracy motion estimates in simulation is
then compared with the originally proposed 4.4 mm undersampled 3D iNAV in six
volunteer studies.
  Results: The simulations indicate that for navigators beyond certain scan
acceleration factors, the accuracy of motion estimates is compromised due to
errors from residual aliasing and blurring/smoothening effects following
compressed sensing reconstruction. The 6.4 mm 3D iNAV achieves an acceptable
spatial resolution with a small acceleration factor, resulting in the highest
accuracy motion information among all assessed undersampled 3D iNAVs. Reader
scores for six volunteer studies demonstrate superior coronary vessel sharpness
when applying an autofocusing nonrigid correction technique using the 6.4 mm 3D
iNAVs in place of 4.4 mm 3D iNAVs.
  Conclusion: Undersampled 6.4 mm 3D iNAVs enable motion tracking with improved
accuracy relative to previously proposed undersampled 4.4 mm 3D iNAVs.

The occultation chords were compared to a 3D shape model of the satellite
obtained from Cassini observations. The rotation period available in the
literature led to a sub-observer point at the moment of the observed
occultations where the chords could not fit the 3D model. A procedure was
developed to identify the correct sub-observer longitude. It allowed us to
obtain the rotation period with improved precision over currently known value
from literature. We show that the difference between the observed and the

rotation period. By comparing these values with recently observed rotational
light curves and single-chord stellar occultations, we can identify the best

developing models based on diverse EHR sources. Federated Learning (FL) has
enabled predictive modeling using distributed training which lifted the need of
sharing data and compromising privacy. Since models are distributed in FL, it
is attractive to devise ensembles of Deep Neural Networks that also assess
model uncertainty. We propose a new FL model called Federated Uncertainty-Aware
Learning Algorithm (FUALA) that improves on Federated Averaging (FedAvg) in the
context of EHR. FUALA embeds uncertainty information in two ways: It reduces
the contribution of models with high uncertainty in the aggregated model. It
also introduces model ensembling at prediction time by keeping the last layers
of each hospital from the final round. In FUALA, the Federator (central node)
sends at each round the average model to all hospitals as well as a randomly
assigned hospital model update to estimate its generalization on that hospital
own data. Each hospital sends back its model update as well a generalization
estimation of the assigned model. At prediction time, the model outputs C
predictions for each sample where C is the number of hospital models. The
experimental analysis conducted on a cohort of 87K deliveries for the task of
preterm-birth prediction showed that the proposed approach outperforms FedAvg

technologies have experienced terrific improvements in both accessibility and
hardware capabilities, encouraging the application of these devices across
various domains. While researchers have demonstrated the possible advantages of
AR and VR for certain data science tasks, it is still unclear how these
technologies would perform in the context of exploratory data analysis (EDA) at
large. In particular, we believe it is important to better understand which
level of immersion EDA would concretely benefit from, and to quantify the
contribution of AR and VR with respect to standard analysis workflows.
  In this work, we leverage a Dataspace reconfigurable hybrid reality
environment to study how data scientists might perform EDA in a co-located,
collaborative context. Specifically, we propose the design and implementation
of Immersive Insights, a hybrid analytics system combining high-resolution
displays, table projections, and augmented reality (AR) visualizations of the
data.
  We conducted a two-part user study with twelve data scientists, in which we
evaluated how different levels of data immersion affect the EDA process and
compared the performance of Immersive Insights with a state-of-the-art,
non-immersive data analysis system.

parser. In this paper, we propose a semantic parser that generalizes to
out-of-domain examples by learning a general strategy for parsing an unseen
utterance through adapting the logical forms of seen utterances, instead of
learning to generate a logical form from scratch. Our parser maintains a memory
consisting of a representative subset of the seen utterances paired with their
logical forms. Given an unseen utterance, our parser works by looking up a
similar utterance from the memory and adapting its logical form until it fits
the unseen utterance. Moreover, we present a data generation strategy for
constructing utterance-logical form pairs from different domains. Our results
show an improvement of up to 68.8% on one-shot parsing under two different
evaluation settings compared to the baselines.

free-breathing, high-resolution coronary magnetic resonance angiography using a
3D cones trajectory.
  Methods: To achieve respiratory-resolved 0.98 mm resolution images in a
clinically relevant scan time, we undersample the imaging data with a
variable-density 3D cones trajectory. For retrospective motion compensation,
translational estimates from 3D image-based navigators (3D iNAVs) are used to
bin the imaging data into four phases from end-expiration to end-inspiration.
To ensure pseudo-random undersampling within each respiratory phase, we devise
a phyllotaxis readout ordering scheme mindful of eddy current artifacts in
steady state free precession imaging. Following binning, residual 3D
translational motion within each phase is computed using the 3D iNAVs and
corrected for in the imaging data. The noise-like aliasing characteristic of
the combined phyllotaxis and cones sampling pattern is leveraged in a
compressed sensing reconstruction with spatial and temporal regularization to
reduce aliasing in each of the respiratory phases.
  Results: In a volunteer and 5 patients, respiratory motion compensation using
the proposed method yields improved image quality compared to
non-respiratory-resolved approaches with no motion correction and with 3D
translational correction. Qualitative assessment by two cardiologists indicates
the superior sharpness of coronary segments reconstructed with the proposed
method (P < 0.01).
  Conclusion: The proposed method better mitigates motion artifacts in
free-breathing, high-resolution coronary angiography exams compared to
translational correction.

videos. One approach is to directly apply a highlight extraction algorithm to
video content. However, algorithmic approaches are either domain-specific,
which require experts to spend a long time to design, or resource-intensive,
which require a lot of training data and/or computing resources. In this paper,
we propose Lightor, a novel implicit crowdsourcing approach to overcome these
limitations. The key insight is to collect users' natural interactions with a
live streaming platform, and then leverage them to detect highlights. Lightor
consists of two major components. Highlight Initializer collects time-stamped
chat messages from a live video and then uses them to predict approximate
highlight positions. Highlight Extractor keeps track of how users interact with
these approximate highlight positions and then refines these positions
iteratively. We find that the collected user chat and interaction data are very
noisy, and propose effective techniques to deal with noise. Lightor can be
easily deployed into existing live streaming platforms, or be implemented as a
web browser extension. We recruit hundreds of users from Amazon Mechanical
Turk, and evaluate the performance of Lightor using two popular games in
Twitch. The results show that Lightor can achieve high extraction precision

top matched candidate for the given paper, and the decision component is
responsible for deciding on assigning the top matched person or creating a new

training. Empirically, we evaluate CONNA on two name disambiguation datasets.
Experimental results show that the proposed framework can achieve a

tasks in order to improve performance on all of them, is a core challenge in
the field of machine learning. We focus on matrix regression tasks where the
rank of the weight matrix is constrained to reduce sample complexity. We
introduce the common mechanism regression (CMR) model which assumes a shared
left low-rank component across all tasks, but allows an individual per-task
right low-rank component. This dramatically reduces the number of samples
needed for accurate estimation. The problem of jointly recovering the common
and the local components has a non-convex bi-linear structure. We overcome this
hurdle and provide a provably beneficial non-iterative spectral algorithm.
Appealingly, the solution has favorable behavior as a function of the number of
related tasks and the small number of samples available for each one. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for the challenging task of remote
river discharge estimation across multiple river sites, where data for each
task is naturally scarce. In this scenario sharing a low-rank component between
the tasks translates to a shared spectral reflection of the water, which is a
true underlying physical model. We also show the benefit of the approach on the
markedly different setting of image classification where the common component

molecules in space. To form molecules on a grain surface, adsorbed species
trapped in binding sites must be mobile and migrate to adjacent sites. Thermal
hopping is a popular mechanism for the migration of adsorbed species when the
grain surface is warmed up by stellar radiation. However, previous studies
disregarded the fact that grains can be spun-up to suprathermal rotation by
radiative torques (RATs) during grain heating process. To achieve an accurate
model of surface astrochemistry, in this paper, we study the effect of grain
suprathermal rotation by RATs on thermal hopping of adsorbed species on icy
grain mantles. We find that centrifugal force due to grain suprathermal
rotation can increase the mobility of radicals on/in the ice mantle compared to
the prediction by thermal hopping, and we term this mechanism ro-thermal
hopping. The rate of ro-thermal hopping depends both on the local radiation
energy density (i.e., grain temperature) and gas density, whereas thermal
hopping only depends on grain temperature. We calculate the decrease in grain
temperature required by ro-thermal hopping to produce the same hopping rate as
thermal hopping and find that it increases with increasing the diffusion energy
and decreasing the gas density. We finally study the effect of grain
suprathermal rotation on the segregation of ice mixtures and find that
ro-thermal segregation of CO$_2$ from H$_2$O-CO$_2$ ices can occur at much
lower temperatures than thermal segregation reported by experiments. Our
results indicate that grain suprathermal rotation can enhance mobility,
formation, desorption, and segregation of molecules in icy grain mantles.

to extract generalizable knowledge from a trained classifier into a
human-understandable format, for various purposes such as model assessment,
debugging and trust. From a computaional viewpoint, it is formulated as
approximating the target classifier using a simpler interpretable model, such
as rule models like a decision set/list/tree. Often, this approximation is
handled as standard supervised learning and the only difference is that the
labels are provided by the target classifier instead of ground truth. This
paradigm is particularly popular because there exists a variety of well-studied
supervised algorithms for learning an interpretable classifier. However, we
argue that this paradigm is suboptimal for it does not utilize the unique
property of the model interpretation problem, that is, the ability to generate
synthetic instances and query the target classifier for their labels. We call
this the active-query property, suggesting that we should consider model
interpretation from an active learning perspective. Following this insight, we
argue that the active-query property should be employed when designing a model
interpretation algorithm, and that the generation of synthetic instances should
be integrated seamlessly with the algorithm that learns the model
interpretation. In this paper, we demonstrate that by doing so, it is possible
to achieve more faithful interpretation with simpler model complexity. As a
technical contribution, we present an active algorithm Active Decision Set
Induction (ADS) to learn a decision set, a set of if-else rules, for model
interpretation. ADS performs a local search over the space of all decision
sets. In every iteration, ADS computes confidence intervals for the value of

systems are often plagued by unknown interactions, which make the physics-based
relations of the system dynamics only partially known. This paper presents a
neural network augmented physics (NNAP) model as a combination of
physics-inspired and neural layers. The neural layers are inserted in the model
to compensate for the unmodeled interactions, without requiring direct
measurements of these unknown phenomena. In contrast to traditional approaches,
both the neural network and physical parameters are simultaneously optimized,
solely by using state and control input measurements. The methodology is
applied on experimental data of a slider-crank setup for which the state
dependent load interactions are unknown. The NNAP model proves to be a stable
and accurate modeling formalism for dynamic systems that ab initio can only be
partially described by physical laws. Moreover, the results show that a
recurrent implementation of the NNAP model enables improved robustness and
accuracy of the system state predictions, compared to its feedforward

means to gain new insights by extracting the neural network from the converged

describe the evolutions of different spectral components in different
transverse modes for Raman fiber amplifiers (RFAs). Both the effects of the
four-wave-mixing in the fundamental mode (FM FWM) and the inter-modal
four-wave-mixing (IM FWM) on high-power RFAs are demonstrated through numerical
simulations. Specifically, effective FM FWM interactions could occur and lead
to a drop of the Raman threshold for RFAs by over 50%, despite that the
corresponding wave-vector mismatch is rather big. In addition, the IM FWM could
also impact the Raman threshold for RFAs with additional generation of the
first order Raman Stokes light in the higher-order mode. We also investigate
the effects of the intensity fluctuations in the initial inserted pump and seed
lasers on high-power RFAs. It reveals that the temporal stability of the
initial inserted pump laser have much more significant impacts on high-power
RFAs than that of the initial inserted seed laser. Notably, through applying
temporal stable laser as the initial inserted pump laser, both the FM FWM and
IM FWM effects could be effectively suppressed, and the Raman threshold for
high-power RFAs could be increased by over twice.

approximately 1 kHz trigger readout in minimum-bias Pb--Pb collisions to a 50
kHz continuous readout rate. The reconstruction strategy of the online-offline
computing upgrade foresees a synchronous online reconstruction stage during
data taking, which generates the detector calibration, and a posterior
calibrated asynchronous reconstruction stage. The huge amount of data requires
a significant compression in order to store all recorded events. The aim is a
factor 20 compression of the TPC data, which is one of the main challenges
during synchronous reconstruction. In addition, the reconstruction will run
online, processing 50 times more collisions than at present, yielding results
comparable to current offline reconstruction. These requirements pose new
challenges for the tracking, including the continuous TPC readout, more
overlapping collisions, no a priori knowledge of the primary vertex position
and of location-dependent calibration during the synchronous phase,
identification of low-momentum looping tracks, and a distorted refit to improve
track model entropy coding. At the 2018 workshop, the TPC tracking for Run 3
was presented, which matches the physics performance of the Run 2 offline
tracking. It leverages the potential of hardware accelerators via the OpenCL
and CUDA APIs in a shared source code for CPUs and GPUs for both reconstruction
stages. Porting more reconstruction steps like the remainder of the TPC
reconstruction and tracking for other detectors to GPU will shift the computing
balance from traditional processors towards GPUs. These proceedings focus on
the global tracking strategy, including the ITS and TRD detectors, offloading
more reconstruction steps onto GPU, and the approaches taken to achieve the
necessary data compression.

of ~ 77% and a beam quality of M2~1.21. The amplified spontaneous emission
(ASE) noise in the fiber amplifier was effectively suppressed by incorporating
an ASE-filtering system between the seed laser and the main amplifier. Further

the temporal evolution of a multi-longitudinal mode YDFL. Specifically, the
temporal evolution would experience sharp change during one cavity round-trip

Representative cases are simulated to study the influences of structure
parameters on the temporal dynamics and the longitudinal mode characteristics
in YDFLs. Three types of temporal instabilities, i.e. sustained self-pulsing,
self-mode locking, and turbulence-like pulsing, coexist in a multi-longitudinal

are all the reflectors of intrinsic characteristics of longitudinal modes

distributions is fundamental for inference in mixed effects models. Random walk
Metropolis is widely used to perform such sampling, but this method is known to
converge slowly for medium dimensional problems, or when the joint structure of
the distributions to sample is spatially heterogeneous. The main contribution
consists of an independent Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm based on a
multidimensional Gaussian proposal that takes into account the joint
conditional distribution of the random effects and does not require any tuning.
Indeed, this distribution is automatically obtained thanks to a Laplace
approximation of the incomplete data model. Such approximation is shown to be
equivalent to linearizing the structural model in the case of continuous data.
Numerical experiments based on simulated and real data illustrate the
performance of the proposed methods. For fitting nonlinear mixed effects
models, the suggested MH algorithm is efficiently combined with a stochastic

we construct the PCR model by stacking several CAMs sequentially with shortcuts

hard case inference, we propose a hard-negative person detection mining
strategy together with a joint-training strategy by exploiting the unlabeled

lattice Hamiltonians with strong local (on site) interactions, the most popular
being the Hubbard model. Although the half filled Hubbard model can be
simulated by Monte Carlo(MC), physically more interesting cases beyond half
filling are plagued by the sign problem. One therefore should resort to other
methods. It was demonstrated recently that a systematic truncation of the set
of Dyson-Schwinger equations for correlators of the Hubbard, supplemented by a
\textquotedblleft covariant"" calculation of correlators leads to a convergent
series of approximants. The covariance preserves all the Ward identities among
correlators describing various condensed matter probes. While first order
(classical), second (Hartree-Fock or gaussian) and third (Cubic) covariant
approximation were worked out, the fourth (quartic) seems too complicated to be
effectively calculable in fermionic systems. It turns out that the complexity
of the quartic calculation\ in local interaction models,is manageable
computationally. The quartic (Bethe - Salpeter type) approximation is
especially important in 1D and 2D models in which the symmetry broken state
does not exists (the Mermin - Wagner theorem), although strong fluctuations
dominate the physics at strong coupling. Unlike the lower order approximations,
it respects the Mermin - Wagner theorem. The scheme is tested and exemplified
on the single band 1D and 2D Hubbard model.

good at image processing, an image representation method is proposed to
transfer a TSP to an image. Based on samples of a 10 city TSP, a fully

obtained on the scale of milliseconds. The results show good performance in
finding the global optimal solution. Moreover, the developed FCN model has been

Paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition was evidenced in both samples
around 254 K. This transition is, characterized by a drastic jump of the
susceptibility in the sample with Ca-vacancies. The maximum of entropy change,
observed for both compounds at magnetic field of 6T was 2.30 J kg-1K-1 and 2.70
J kg-1K-1 for the parent compound and the lacunar one respectively. The
magnetocaloric adiabatic temperature change value calculated by indirect method
was 5.6 K and 5.2 K for the non-lacunar and Ca-vacancy compound, respectively.
The Ca-lacunar La0.5Ca0.5-x xMnO3 (x=0.05) reported in this work demonstrated
overall enhancement of the magnetocaloric effect over the LCMO. The technique
used to elaborate LCMO materials was beneficial to enhance the magnetocaloric

environmentally friendly system can be considered as more advantageous
candidate for magnetic refrigeration applications then the commonly Gd-based

smooth out unexpected large learning rates and stabilize the training of deep

model, called the Hoare-query model, which is general enough to capture
algorithms such as IC3/PDR and its variants. An algorithm in this model learns
about the system's reachable states by querying the validity of Hoare triples.
  We show that in general an algorithm in the Hoare-query model requires an
exponential number of queries. Our lower bound is information-theoretic and
applies even to computationally unrestricted algorithms, showing that no choice
of generalization from the partial information obtained in a polynomial number
of Hoare queries can lead to an efficient invariant inference procedure in this
class.
  We then show, for the first time, that by utilizing rich Hoare queries, as
done in PDR, inference can be exponentially more efficient than approaches such
as ICE learning, which only utilize inductiveness checks of candidates. We do
so by constructing a class of transition systems for which a simple version of
PDR with a single frame infers invariants in a polynomial number of queries,
whereas every algorithm using only inductiveness checks and counterexamples
requires an exponential number of queries.
  Our results also shed light on connections and differences with the classical
theory of exact concept learning with queries, and imply that learning from
counterexamples to induction is harder than classical exact learning from
labeled examples. This demonstrates that the convergence rate of
Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis depends on the form of
counterexamples.

is to use three segmentation hypotheses, each based on a different number of
visible walls. For each hypothesis, we predict the image locations of the room

nowadays, and various index structures are constructed to speed up the query

the traffic condition changes dynamically, which makes the pathfinding slower
than in the static environment. In order to speed up path query answering in
the dynamic road network, we propose a framework to support these indexes.
Firstly, we view the dynamic graph as a series of static snapshots. After that,
we propose two kinds of methods to select the typical snapshots. The first kind
is time-based and it only considers the temporal information. The second
category is the graph representation-based, which considers more insights:
edge-based that captures the road continuity, and vertex-based that reflects
the region traffic fluctuation. Finally, we propose the snapshot matching to
find the most similar typical snapshot for the current traffic condition and
use its index to answer the query directly. Extensive experiments on real-life

use of the similarity of samples to conduct a fully unsupervised method which
just trains on the unlabeled target dataset. Concretely, we propose a
hierarchical clustering-guided re-ID (HCR) method. We use hierarchical
clustering to generate pseudo labels and use these pseudo labels as monitors to
conduct the training. In order to exclude hard examples and promote the
convergence of the model, We use PK sampling in each iteration, which randomly
selects a fixed number of samples from each cluster for training. We evaluate
our model on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17. Results show that HCR gets
the state-of-the-arts and achieves 55.3% mAP on Market-1501 and 46.8% mAP on

for the residents. As presented in Baidu traffic report, the commuting stress

in longer trip time and increased vehicular queueing. Previous works have
demonstrated that by reasonable scheduling, e.g, rebalancing bike-sharing
systems and optimized bus transportation, the traffic efficiency could be
significantly improved with little resource consumption. However, there are
still two disadvantages that restrict their performance: (1) they only consider
single scheduling in a short time, but ignoring the layout after first
reposition, and (2) they only focus on the single transport. However, the
multi-modal characteristics of urban public transportation are largely
under-exploited. In this paper, we propose an efficient and economical

Building on the observation that not all parts of a scene need to be simulated

low-fidelity states for scene objects in a task-informed manner. Our
contribution is a framework for speeding up robot simulation by exploiting task
knowledge. The framework is agnostic to the underlying simulator, and preserves
simulation fidelity. As a case study, we consider a complex material-handling

the ionic migration being a reversible process, it often leads to worsening of
perovskite based device performance, hysteresis in current-voltage
characteristics, and phase segregation in mixed halide perovskites being as the
most harmful effect. The reason is in dynamical band structure changes, which
controllable engineering would solve one of the biggest challenges for
development of light-emitting solar cells. Here we demonstrate controllable
band bending due to migration of both cation and anion ions in mixed halide
perovskite devices. The band structure rearrangement is demonstrated in light
emitting solar cells based on the perovskite with organic cations
methylammonium (MA+) and formamidinium (FA+), possessing non-zero dipole
momentum of 2.29 and 0.21 Debye, respectively, and with PEDOT:PSS and C60
transport layers having a high barrier of 0.8 eV for charge injection. Under
applied external voltage MA+ and FA+ cations move towards the electron
transport layer and form a dipole layer at the perovskite/electron transport
interface, which lowers threshold voltage for electroluminescence down to 1.7 V
for MAPbBr2I and 2.6 V for FAPbBr2I, whereas monohalide perovskite MAPbBr3 does
not demonstrate such behavior. This ability to in-situ change the device band

the sum of two closed proper convex functions, one of which involves a
composition with a linear transform. GRPDA preserves all the favorable features
of the classical primal-dual algorithm (PDA), i.e., the primal and the dual
variables are updated in a Gauss-Seidel manner, and the per iteration cost is
dominated by the evaluation of the proximal point mappings of the two component
functions and two matrix-vector multiplications. Compared with the classical
PDA, which takes an extrapolation step, the novelty of GRPDA is that it is
constructed based on a convex combination of essentially the whole iteration
trajectory. We show that GRPDA converges within a broader range of parameters
than the classical PDA, provided that the reciprocal of the convex combination
parameter is bounded above by the golden ratio, which explains the name of the
algorithm. An O(1/N) ergodic convergence rate result is also established based
on the primal-dual gap function, where N denotes the number of iterations. When
either the primal or the dual problem is strongly convex, an accelerated GRPDA
is constructed to improve the ergodic convergence rate from O(1/N) to O(1/N2).
Moreover, we show for regularized least-squares and linear equality constrained
problems that the reciprocal of the convex combination parameter can be
extended from the golden ratio to 2 and meanwhile a relaxation step can be
taken. Our preliminary numerical results on LASSO, nonnegative least-squares

and nervous system investigation. The recorded signals are typically a
combination of spikes and noise. High amounts of background noise and
possibility of electric signaling recording from several neurons adjacent to
the recording site have led scientists to develop neuronal signal processing
tools such as spike sorting to facilitate brain data analysis. Spike sorting
plays a pivotal role in understanding the electrophysiological activity of
neuronal networks. This process prepares recorded data for interpretations of
neurons interactions and understanding the overall structure of brain
functions. Spike sorting consists of three steps: spike detection, feature
extraction, and spike clustering. There are several methods to implement each
of spike sorting steps. This paper provides a systematic comparison of various
spike sorting sub-techniques applied to real extracellularly recorded data from
a rat brain basolateral amygdala. An efficient sorted data resulted from
careful choice of spike sorting sub-methods leads to better interpretation of
the brain structures connectivity under different conditions, which is a very
sensitive concept in diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. Here,
spike detection is performed by appropriate choice of threshold level via three
different approaches. Feature extraction is done through PCA and Kernel PCA
methods, which Kernel PCA outperforms. We have applied four different
algorithms for spike clustering including K-means, Fuzzy C-means, Bayesian and
Fuzzy maximum likelihood estimation. As one requirement of most clustering
algorithms, optimal number of clusters is achieved through validity indices for
each method. Finally, the sorting results are evaluated using inter-spike

proposed algorithm to generate various adversarial examples in the form of
rectangle, circle, ellipse and spots cluster. Experimental results show that
these adversarial examples are almost ignored by human eyes, but can fool
HyperLPR with high attack success rate over 93%. Therefore, we believe that
this kind of spot evasion attacks would pose a great threat to current LPR
systems, and needs to be investigated further by the security community.

biometric systems have started to increase. Since the characteristics of each
person are different from each other, a single model biometric system can yield
successful results. However, because the characteristics of twin people are
very close to each other, multiple biometric systems including multiple
characteristics of individuals will be more appropriate and will increase the
recognition rate. In this study, a multiple biometric recognition system
consisting of a combination of multiple algorithms and multiple models was
developed to distinguish people from other people and their twins. Ear and
voice biometric data were used for the multimodal model and 38 pair of twin ear
images and sound recordings were used in the data set. Sound and ear
recognition rates were obtained using classical (hand-crafted) and deep
learning algorithms. The results obtained were combined with the hierarchical
score level fusion method to achieve a success rate of 94.74% in rank-1 and
100% in rank -2.

  Simulation Environment","8 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This study developed a traffic sign detection and recognition algorithm based
on the RetinaNet. Two main aspects were revised to improve the detection of
traffic signs: image cropping to address the issue of large image and small
traffic signs; and using more anchors with various scales to detect traffic
signs with different sizes and shapes. The proposed algorithm was trained and
tested in a series of autonomous driving front-view images in a virtual
simulation environment. Results show that the algorithm performed extremely
well under good illumination and weather conditions. Its drawbacks are that it
sometimes failed to detect object under bad weather conditions like snow and
failed to distinguish speed limits signs with different limit values.

  Natural Images","This preprint is the result of the work done for the undergraduate
  dissertation of M. Pividori supervised by L.C. Uzal and G.L. Grinblat, and
  presented in July 2019",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have demonstrated impressive results in
modeling the distribution of natural images, learning latent representations
that capture semantic variations in an unsupervised basis. Beyond the
generation of novel samples, it is of special interest to exploit the ability
of the GAN generator to model the natural image manifold and hence generate
credible changes when manipulating images. However, this line of work is
conditioned by the quality of the reconstruction. Until now, only inversion to
the latent space has been considered, we propose to exploit the representation
in intermediate layers of the generator, and we show that this leads to
increased capacity. In particular, we observe that the representation after the
first dense layer, present in all state-of-the-art GAN models, is expressive
enough to represent natural images with high visual fidelity. It is possible to
interpolate around these images obtaining a sequence of new plausible synthetic
images that cannot be generated from the latent space. Finally, as an example
of potential applications that arise from this inversion mechanism, we show
preliminary results in exploiting the learned representation in the attention
map of the generator to obtain an unsupervised segmentation of natural images.

ability of this new perception to find all possible critical points and regions
in which phase transitions occur, an impossible task in the standard method.
