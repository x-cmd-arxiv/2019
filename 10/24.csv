search for signs of new physics and is the primary goal of the NA62 experiment
at CERN. In this paper we report on a lattice QCD calculation of the
long-distance contribution to the $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar{\nu}$ decay amplitude at
the near-physical pion mass $m_\pi=170$ MeV. The calculations are however,
performed on a coarse lattice and hence with a lighter charm quark mass
($m_c^{\bar{\mathrm{MS}}}(\mbox{3 GeV})=750$ MeV) than the physical one. The
main aims of this study are two-fold. Firstly we study the momentum dependence
of the amplitude and conclude that it is very mild so that a computation at
physical masses even at a single kinematic point would provide a good estimate
of the long-distance contribution to the decay rate. Secondly we compute the
contribution to the branching ratio from the two-pion intermediate state whose
energy is below the kaon mass and find that it is less than 1% after its
exponentially growing unphysical contribution has been removed and that the
corresponding non-exponential finite-volume effects are negligibly small.

the particle and the solenoid interact locally with the quantum electromagnetic
field. This interaction results in a local and gauge-independent phase
generation for the particle propagation in each path of the interferometer.

the acquired phases for interferometers with arbitrary geometries, and this is

iteratively reweighted norm approach, the nuclear norm regularized problem is
reformulated as a sequence of quadratic problems, which can then be efficiently
solved using Krylov methods, giving rise to an inner-outer iteration scheme.
Our approach differs from the other solvers available in the literature in
that: (a) Kronecker product properties are exploited to define the reweighted
2-norm penalization terms; (b) efficient preconditioned Krylov methods replace
gradient (projection) methods; (c) the regularization parameter can be
efficiently and adaptively set along the iterations. Furthermore, we
reformulate within the framework of flexible Krylov methods both the new
inner-outer methods for nuclear norm regularization and some of the existing
Krylov methods incorporating low-rank projections. This results in an even more
computationally efficient (but heuristic) strategy, that does not rely on an
inner-outer iteration scheme. Numerical experiments show that our new solvers
are competitive with other state-of-the-art solvers for low-rank problems, and
deliver reconstructions of increased quality with respect to other classical
Krylov methods.

terminals $\mathcal{T} \subseteq V: |\mathcal{T}| = k$, a mimicking network for
$(G,\mathcal{T})$ is a graph $(H,w')$ that contains copies of $\mathcal{T}$ and
preserves the value of minimum cuts separating any subset $A, B \subseteq
\mathcal{T}$ of terminals. Mimicking networks of size $2^{2^k}$ are known to
exist and can be constructed algorithmically, while the best known lower bound
is $2^{\Omega(k)}$; therefore, an exponential size is required if one aims at
preserving cuts exactly. In this paper, we study mimicking networks that
preserve connectivity of the graph exactly up to the value of $c$, where $c$ is
a parameter. This notion of mimicking network is sufficient for some
applications, as we will elaborate. We first show that a mimicking of size $3^c

network of size linear in $k$. Next, we show an algorithm that finds such a
mimicking network in time $2^{O(c^2)} \operatorname{poly}(m)$.

recall the classical EVS for uncorrelated variables and discuss the three

Gumbel, Fr\'echet and Weibull distribution. We then show that, for weakly
correlated random variables with a finite correlation length/time, the limiting
extreme value distribution can still be inferred from that of the uncorrelated
variables using a renormalisation group-like argument. Finally, we consider the
most interesting examples of strongly correlated variables for which there are
very few exact results for the EVS. We discuss few examples of such strongly
correlated systems (such as the Brownian motion and the eigenvalues of a random
matrix) where some analytical progress can be made. We also discuss other
observables related to extremes, such as the density of near-extreme events,

formulates a multi-stream scheme intending to solely train the attention fusion

structure-odor relationship (QSOR) modeling, is an important challenge in
chemistry, impacting human nutrition, manufacture of synthetic fragrance, the
environment, and sensory neuroscience. We propose the use of graph neural
networks for QSOR, and show they significantly out-perform prior methods on a
novel data set labeled by olfactory experts. Additional analysis shows that the
learned embeddings from graph neural networks capture a meaningful odor space
representation of the underlying relationship between structure and odor, as
demonstrated by strong performance on two challenging transfer learning tasks.
Machine learning has already had a large impact on the senses of sight and
sound. Based on these early results with graph neural networks for molecular
properties, we hope machine learning can eventually do for olfaction what it
has already done for vision and hearing.

a query or document. But it is a weak signal, especially when the frequency
distribution is flat, such as in long queries or short documents where the text
is of sentence/passage-length. This paper proposes a Deep Contextualized Term
Weighting framework that learns to map BERT's contextualized text
representations to context-aware term weights for sentences and passages. When
applied to passages, DeepCT-Index produces term weights that can be stored in
an ordinary inverted index for passage retrieval. When applied to query text,
DeepCT-Query generates a weighted bag-of-words query. Both types of term weight
can be used directly by typical first-stage retrieval algorithms. This is novel
because most deep neural network based ranking models have higher computational
costs, and thus are restricted to later-stage rankers. Experiments on four
datasets demonstrate that DeepCT's deep contextualized text understanding
greatly improves the accuracy of first-stage retrieval algorithms.

class of correlations allowed by quantum mechanics in this setup is represented
by an elliptope inscribed in a non-signaling cube. The class of correlations

hidden-variable theories by polyhedra with increasing numbers of vertices and
facets that get closer and closer to the elliptope. We use these results to
advocate for an interpretation of quantum mechanics like Bub's. Probabilities
and expectation values are primary in this interpretation. They are determined
by inner products of vectors in Hilbert space. Such vectors do not themselves
represent what is real in the quantum world. They encode families of
probability distributions over values of different sets of observables. As in
classical theory, these values ultimately represent what is real in the quantum
world. Hilbert space puts constraints on possible combinations of such values,
just as Minkowski space-time puts constraints on possible spatio-temporal
constellations of events. Illustrating how generic such constraints are, the
equation for the elliptope derived in this paper is a general constraint on
correlation coefficients that can be found in older literature on statistics

an optical trap. Applying the same method to molecules requires a number of
challenges to be overcome. Strong tensor Stark shifts in molecules cause the
optical trapping potential, and corresponding trap frequency, to depend
strongly on rotational, hyperfine and Zeeman state. Consequently, transition
frequencies depend on the motional quantum number and there are additional
heating mechanisms, either of which can be fatal for an effective sideband
cooling scheme. We develop the theory of sideband cooling in state-dependent
potentials, and derive an expression for the heating due to photon scattering.
We calculate the ac Stark shifts of molecular states in the presence of a
magnetic field, and for any polarization. We show that the complexity of
sideband cooling can be greatly reduced by applying a large magnetic field to
eliminate electron- and nuclear-spin degrees of freedom from the problem. We
consider how large the magnetic field needs to be, show that heating can be
managed sufficiently well, and present a simple recipe for cooling to the
ground state of motion.

means of the Purely Geometric BAO methods. To date two different Purely
Geometric BAO approaches have been proposed. The first exploits the
linear-point standard ruler. The second, called correlation-function
model-fitting, exploits the sound-horizon standard ruler. A key difference
between them is that, when estimated from clustering data, the linear point
makes use of a cosmological-model-independent procedure to extract the ratio of
the ruler to the cosmic distance, while the correlation-function model-fitting
relies on a phenomenological cosmological model for the correlation function.
Nevertheless the two rulers need to be precisely defined independently of any
specific observable. We define the linear point and sound horizon and we
characterize and compare the two rulers' cosmological-parameter dependence. We
find that they are both geometrical within the required accuracy, and they have
the same parameter dependence for a wide range of parameter values. We estimate
the rulers' best-fit values and errors given the cosmological constraints
obtained by the Planck Satellite team from the CMB measurements. We do this for
three different cosmological models encompassed by the Purely Geometric BAO
methods. In each case we find that the relative errors of the two rulers
coincide and they are insensitive to the assumed cosmological model.
Interestingly both the linear point and the sound horizon shift by $0.5\sigma$

a sensitivity of the rulers to different cosmological models when they are

in reaching previously unexplored model space. Several recent proposals rely on
collective excitations, where the experimental sensitivity is highly dependent
on detailed properties of the target material, well beyond just nucleus mass
numbers as in conventional searches. It is thus important to optimize the
target choice when considering which experiment to build. We carry out a
comparative study of target materials across several detection channels,
focusing on electron transitions and single (acoustic or optical) phonon
excitations in crystals, as well as the traditional nuclear recoils. We compare
materials currently in use in nuclear recoil experiments (Si, Ge, NaI, CsI,
CaWO$_4$), a few which have been proposed for light dark matter experiments
(GaAs, Al$_2$O$_3$, diamond), as well as 16 other promising polar crystals
across all detection channels. We find that target- and dark matter
model-dependent reach is largely determined by a small number of material
parameters: speed of sound, electronic band gap, mass number, Born effective
charge, high frequency dielectric constant, and optical phonon energies. We
showcase, for each of the two benchmark models, an exemplary material which has
a better reach than in any currently proposed experiment.

wider range of BLR sizes. We examine the correlation between the deviations

building the central regions of giant elliptical galaxies today. However, a
significant fraction of these objects were previously shown to have much
smaller H$\alpha$ line widths than expected. A possible interpretation is that
H$\alpha$ emission from their central regions, where the highest velocities are
expected, is typically obscured by dust. Here we present ALMA observations of
the CO(3-2) emission line of three compact, massive galaxies with H$\alpha$
line widths of FWHM(H$\alpha$)$\sim$125-260 km s$^{-1}$ to test this
hypothesis. Surprisingly, in all three galaxies, the CO line width is similar
to the H$\alpha$ line width: we find FWHM(CO)$\sim$165 km s$^{-1}$ for all
three galaxies whereas FWHM(CO)$\sim$450-700 km s$^{-1}$ was expected from a
simple virial estimator. These results show that the narrow H$\alpha$
linewidths of many compact massive star-forming galaxies are not due to
preferential obscuration of the highest velocity gas. An alternative
explanation for the narrow line widths is that the galaxies are disks that are
viewed nearly face-on. We suggest that there may be an inclination bias in the
size-mass plane, such that the apparent rest-frame optical sizes of face-on
galaxies are smaller than those of edge-on galaxies. Although not conclusive,
this hypothesis is supported by an observed anti-correlation between the size

  planetesimal impacts: the impact shoreline","Accepted for publication by MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stz3052",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers how planetesimal impacts affect planetary atmospheres.
Atmosphere evolution depends on the ratio of gain from volatiles to loss from
atmosphere stripping f_v; for constant bombardment, atmospheres with f_v<1 are
destroyed in finite time, but grow linearly with time for f_v>1. An impact
outcome prescription is used to characterise how f_v depends on planetesimal
impact velocities, size distribution and composition. Planets that are low mass
and/or close to the star have atmospheres that deplete in impacts, while high
mass and/or distant planets grow secondary atmospheres. Dividing these outcomes
is an fv=1 impact shoreline analogous to Zahnle & Catling's cosmic shoreline.
The impact shoreline's location depends on assumed impacting planetesimal
properties, so conclusions for the atmospheric evolution of a planet like Earth
with f_v~1 are only as strong as those assumptions. Application to the
exoplanet population shows the gap in the planet radius distribution at
~1.5R_earth is coincident with the impact shoreline, which has a similar
dependence on orbital period and stellar mass to the observed gap. Given
sufficient bombardment, planets below the gap would be expected to lose their
atmospheres, while those above could have atmospheres enhanced in volatiles.
The level of atmosphere alteration depends on the total bombardment a planet
experiences, and so on the system's (usually unknown) other planets and
planetesimals, though massive distant planets would have low accretion
efficiency. Habitable zone planets around lower luminosity stars are more
susceptible to atmosphere stripping, disfavouring M stars as hosts of
life-bearing planets if Earth-like bombardment is conducive to the development

other phenomena, Ellerman bombs (EBs), which are observed in H alpha and are
due to magnetic reconnection in the photosphere below the chromospheric canopy.
Signs of reconnection are also observed in other spectral lines, typical of the
chromosphere or the transition region. An example are the UV bursts observed in
the transition region lines of Si IV and the upper chromospheric lines of Mg
II. In this work we analyze high cadence, high resolution coordinated
observations between the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) and the Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) spacecraft. H alpha images from the SST
provide us with the positions, timings and trajectories of EBs in an emerging
flux region. Simultaneous, co-aligned IRIS slit-jaw images at 133 (C II,
transition region), 140 (Si IV, transition region) and 279.6 (Mg II k, core,
upper chromosphere) nm, as well as spectroscopy in the far and near ultraviolet

chromospheric/transition region counterparts of those EBs. Our main goal is to
study the possible temporal and spatial relationship between several
reconnection events at different layers in the atmosphere (namely EBs and UV
bursts), the timing history between them, and the connection of these dynamical
phenomena to the ejection of surges in the chromosphere. We also investigate
the properties of an extended UV burst and their variations across the burst
domain. Our results suggest a scenario where simultaneous and co-spatial EBs

along a vertical or nearly vertical current sheet. Heating and bidirectional

mass segregation of NSs, thereby reducing the dynamical interaction rates of
NSs so that at most a few NS binary mergers are ever produced. We estimate the
merger rate in the local universe to be $\sim\rm{0.02\,Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$ for
both NS-NS and NS-BH binaries, or a total of $\sim 0.04$~Gpc$^{-3}$~yr$^{-1}$

typical characteristics of misaligned galaxies in both observations and
simulations to determine their fundamental relationship with morphology and
angular momentum. We present a sample of ~4500 galaxies from MaNGA with
kinematic classifications which we use to demonstrate that the prevalence of
misalignment is strongly dependent on morphology. The misaligned fraction
sharply increases going to earlier morphologies (28$\pm$3% of 301 early-type
galaxies, 10$\pm$1% of 677 lenticulars and 5.4$\pm$0.6% of 1634 pure late-type
galaxies). For early-types, aligned galaxies are less massive than the
misaligned sample whereas this trend reverses for lenticulars and pure
late-types. We also find that decoupling depends on group membership for
early-types with centrals more likely to be decoupled than satellites. We
demonstrate that misaligned galaxies have similar stellar angular momentum to
galaxies without gas rotation, much lower than aligned galaxies. Misaligned
galaxies also have a lower gas mass than the aligned, indicative that gas loss
is a crucial step in decoupling star-gas rotation. Through comparison to a mock
MaNGA sample, we find that the strong trends with morphology and angular
momentum hold true in IllustrisTNG100. We demonstrate that the lowered angular
momentum is, however, not a transient property and that the likelihood of
star-gas misalignment at z = 0 is correlated with the spin of the dark matter

elusive. We review this history up to recent developments which have shown that
discrete TTSB does takes place in periodically driven (Floquet) systems in the
presence of many-body localization. Such Floquet time-crystals represent a new
paradigm in quantum statistical mechanics --- that of an intrinsically
out-of-equilibrium many-body phase of matter.
  We include a compendium of necessary background, before specializing to a
detailed discussion of the nature, and diagnostics, of TTSB. We formalize the
notion of a time-crystal as a stable, macroscopic, conservative clock ---
explaining both the need for a many-body system in the infinite volume limit,
and for a lack of net energy absorption or dissipation.
  We also cover a range of related phenomena, including various types of
long-lived prethermal time-crystals, and expose the roles played by symmetries
-- exact and (emergent) approximate -- and their breaking. We clarify the
distinctions between many-body time-crystals and other ostensibly similar
phenomena dating as far back as the works of Faraday and Mathieu. En route, we
encounter Wilczek's suggestion that macroscopic systems should exhibit TTSB in
their ground states, together with a theorem ruling this out. We also analyze
pioneering recent experiments detecting signatures of time crystallinity in a
variety of different platforms, and provide a detailed theoretical explanation
of the physics in each case. In all existing experiments, the system does not
realize a `true' time-crystal phase, and we identify necessary ingredients for

which cover optical, infrared and X-rays between 40s and 3yr after the burst,
to derive the properties of the dominant jet and its host galaxy. Polarisation
observations by the MASTER telescope indicate that this burst is weakly
polarised. The optical spectrum contains absorption features, from which we
confirm the redshift of the GRB as originating at z=2.276. We performed
spectral fitting of the X-rays to optical afterglow data and find there is no
strong spectral evolution. We determine the hydrogen column density to be
7.2x10^21cm^-2 along the line of sight. The afterglow in this burst can be
explained by a blast wave jet with a long-lasting central engine expanding into
a uniform medium in the slow cooling regime. At the end of energy injection, a
normal decay phase is observed in both the optical and X-ray bands. An
achromatic jet break is also found in the afterglow light curves 0.4d after
trigger. We fit the multiwavelength data simultaneously with a model based on a
numerical simulation and find that the observations can be explained by a
narrow uniform jet in a dense environment with an opening angle of 6.7deg
viewed 3.8deg off-axis, which released a total energy of 1.4x10^54erg. Using
the redshift and opening angle, we find GRB 140629A follows both the Ghirlanda
and Amati relations. From the peak time of the light curve, identified as the
onset of the forward shock (181s after trigger), the initial Lorentz factor is
constrained in the range 82-118. Fitting the host galaxy photometry, we find
the host to be a low mass, star-forming galaxy with a star formation rate of
logSFR=1.1^+0.9_-0.4Myr^-1. We obtain a value of the neutral hydrogen density
by fitting the optical spectrum, logN(HI)=21.0+-0.3, classifying this host as a
damped Lyman-alpha. High ionisation lines are also detected in the spectrum.

by leveraging connections to the theory of discrete optimal transport to
convert the combinatorial assignment problem into a tractable linear program.
We seek to allow a multi-vehicle swarm to accomplish a dynamically changing
task, for example tracking a multi-target swarm. Our approach simultaneously
determines the optimal assignment and the control of the individual agents. As
a result, the assignment policy accounts for the dynamics and capabilities of a
heterogeneous set of agents and targets. In contrast to a majority of existing
assignment schemes, this approach improves upon distance-based metrics for
assignments by considering cost metrics that account for the underlying
dynamics manifold. We provide a theoretical justification for the reformulation
of this problem, and show that the minimizer of the dynamic assignment problem
is equivalent to the minimizer of the associated Monge problem arising in
optimal transport. We prove that by accounting for dynamics, we only require
computing an assignment once over the operating lifetime --- significantly
decreasing computational expense. Furthermore, we show that the cost benefits
achieved by our approach increase as the swarm size increases, achieving almost
50\% cost reduction compared with distance-based metrics. We demonstrate our
approach through simulation on several linear and linearized problems.

does not require any knowledge on models and alleviates the problems during an

the state-of-the-art planning methods are typically restricted to short

waves involved. We find that the coupling between the angular momentum
transported horizontally by the semi-diurnal tide and the mean circulation is
the mechanism responsible for producing the strong jet at low latitudes. Our
simulations indicate the possible formation of atmospheric indirect cells at
low latitudes. The formation of these cells is induced by the presence of the
semi-diurnal tide that is driven by the stellar irradiation. The tropical
circulation has an important impact transporting heat and momentum from the
upper towards the lower atmosphere. One of the consequences of this heat and
momentum transport is a global increase of the temperature. We show that the
initial conditions do not affect the output of the reference simulation.
However, when the period of rotation of the planet was increased ($P_{rot} > 5$
Earth days), vertical transport by stationary waves became stronger, transient
waves became non-negligible, and Coriolis influence less dominant, which
allowed a steady state with a strong retrograde jet to be stable. We found that

of bifurcation in these studies was based on heuristic approaches or clustering
techniques. In contrast, the proposed technique enables automatic bifurcation
using non-linear planes in high-dimensional turbulent combustion manifolds that
are often associated with complex behavior due to different dominating physics
in various zones. The proposed concept is validated using 4-dimensional (4D)
and 5D flamelet tables, showing that the errors obtained with a given network
size, or conversely the network size required to achieve a given accuracy, is
considerably reduced. The effect of the number of experts on inference speed is
also investigated, showing that by increasing the number of experts from 1 to
8, the inference time can be approximately reduced by a factor of two.
Moreover, it is shown that the MoE approach divides the input manifold in a
physically intuitive manner, suggesting that the MoE framework can elucidate
high-dimensional datasets in a physically meaningful way.

applications in wireless communications. A deep learning classifier is
considered to classify wireless signals using raw (I/Q) samples as features and
modulation types as labels. An adversary slightly manipulates training data by
inserting Trojans (i.e., triggers) to only few training data samples by
modifying their phases and changing the labels of these samples to a target
label. This poisoned training data is used to train the deep learning
classifier. In test (inference) time, an adversary transmits signals with the
same phase shift that was added as a trigger during training. While the
receiver can accurately classify clean (unpoisoned) signals without triggers,
it cannot reliably classify signals poisoned with triggers. This stealth attack
remains hidden until activated by poisoned inputs (Trojans) to bypass a signal
classifier (e.g., for authentication). We show that this attack is successful
over different channel conditions and cannot be mitigated by simply
preprocessing the training and test data with random phase variations. To
detect this attack, activation based outlier detection is considered with
statistical as well as clustering techniques. We show that the latter one can
detect Trojan attacks even if few samples are poisoned.

dispersion curves from seismic ambient noise to gain insight into the crustal
structure of Bransfield Strait and detect seasonal seismic velocity changes. We
cross-correlated four years of vertical component ambient noise data recorded
by a seismic array in West Antarctica. To estimate fundamental mode Rayleigh
wave Green's functions, the correlations are computed in 4-hr segments, stacked
over 1-year time windows and moving windows of 3 months. Rayleigh wave group
dispersion curves are then measured on two spectral bands; primary (10-30 s)
and secondary (5-10 s) microseisms, using frequency-time analysis. We analyze
the temporal evolution of seismic velocity by comparing dispersion curves for
the successive annual and 3-month correlation stacks. Our main assumption was
that the Green's functions from the cross-correlations, and thus the dispersion
curves, remain invariant if the crustal structure remains unchanged. Maximum
amplitudes of secondary microseisms were observed during local winter when the
Southern Ocean experiences winter storms. The Rayleigh wave group velocity
ranges between 2.1 and 3.7 km/s, considering our period range studied.
Inter-annual velocity variations are not much evident. We observe a slight
velocity decrease in summer and increase in winter, which could be attributed
to the pressure melting of ice and an increase in ice mass, respectively. The
velocity anomalies observed within the crust and upper mantle structure
correlate with the major crustal and upper mantle features known from previous
studies in the area. Our results demonstrate that the direct comparison of
surface wave dispersion curves extracted from ambient noise might be a useful
tool in monitoring crustal structure variations.

that has emerged over the last 20 years, which we propose to call
feature-mapping methods. The two defining aspects of these methods are that the
design is parameterized by a high-level geometric description and that features
are mapped onto a fixed grid for analysis. The main motivation for using these
methods is to gain better control over the geometry to, for example, facilitate
imposing direct constraints on geometric features, whilst avoiding issues with
re-meshing. The review starts by providing some key definitions and then
examines the ingredients that these methods use to map geometric features onto
a fixed-grid. One of these ingredients corresponds to the mechanism for mapping
the geometry of a single feature onto a fixed analysis grid, from which an
ersatz material or an immersed boundary approach is used for the analysis. For
the former case, which we refer to as the pseudo-density approach, a test
problem is formulated to investigate aspects of the material interpolation,
boundary smoothing and numerical integration. We also review other ingredients
of feature-mapping techniques, including approaches for combining features
(which are required to perform topology optimization) and methods for imposing
a minimum separation distance among features. A literature review of
feature-mapping methods is provided for shape optimization, combined
feature/free-form optimization, and topology optimization. Finally, we discuss
potential future research directions for feature-mapping methods.

applications, heavily involve sparse linear algebra operations. These
operations use sparse matrix compression as an effective means to avoid storing
zeros and performing unnecessary computation on zero elements. However,
compression techniques like Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) that are widely used
today introduce significant instruction overhead and expensive pointer-chasing
operations to discover the positions of the non-zero elements. In this paper,
we identify the discovery of the positions (i.e., indexing) of non-zero
elements as a key bottleneck in sparse matrix-based workloads, which greatly
reduces the benefits of compression. We propose SMASH, a hardware-software
cooperative mechanism that enables highly-efficient indexing and storage of
sparse matrices. The key idea of SMASH is to explicitly enable the hardware to
recognize and exploit sparsity in data. To this end, we devise a novel software
encoding based on a hierarchy of bitmaps. This encoding can be used to
efficiently compress any sparse matrix, regardless of the extent and structure
of sparsity. At the same time, the bitmap encoding can be directly interpreted
by the hardware. We design a lightweight hardware unit, the Bitmap Management
Unit (BMU), that buffers and scans the bitmap hierarchy to perform
highly-efficient indexing of sparse matrices. SMASH exposes an expressive and
rich ISA to communicate with the BMU, which enables its use in accelerating any
sparse matrix computation. We demonstrate the benefits of SMASH on four use
cases that include sparse matrix kernels and graph analytics applications.

to protect the organizational data, knowledge and intellectual properties. In
order to protect organizations database DAM systems have two main roles,
monitoring (documenting activity) and alerting to anomalous activity. Due to
high-velocity streams and operating costs, such systems are restricted to
examining only a sample of the activity. Current solutions use policies,
manually crafted by experts, to decide which transactions to monitor and log.
This limits the diversity of the data collected. Bandit algorithms, which use
reward functions as the basis for optimization while adding diversity to the
recommended set, have gained increased attention in recommendation systems for
improving diversity.
  In this work, we redefine the data sampling problem as a special case of the
multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem and present a novel algorithm, which combines
expert knowledge with random exploration. We analyze the effect of diversity on
coverage and downstream event detection tasks using a simulated dataset. In
doing so, we find that adding diversity to the sampling using the bandit-based

vulnerable against adversarial attacks under non-additive threat models. An
example of an attack method based on a non-additive threat model is the
Wasserstein adversarial attack proposed by Wong et al. (2019), where the
distance between an image and its adversarial example is determined by the
Wasserstein metric (""earth-mover distance"") between their normalized pixel
intensities. Until now, there has been no certifiable defense against this type
of attack. In this work, we propose the first defense with certified robustness
against Wasserstein Adversarial attacks using randomized smoothing. We develop
this certificate by considering the space of possible flows between images, and
representing this space such that Wasserstein distance between images is
upper-bounded by L_1 distance in this flow-space. We can then apply existing
randomized smoothing certificates for the L_1 metric. In MNIST and CIFAR-10
datasets, we find that our proposed defense is also practically effective,
demonstrating significantly improved accuracy under Wasserstein adversarial

an optimal sensor selection approach is employed that maximizes a joint cost

while preventing redundant nodes from tracking the target. On the other hand,
if the target is traveling through a low node density area or in a coverage gap

potential game is played amongst the surrounding nodes to optimally expand
their sensing ranges via minimizing energy consumption and maximizing target
coverage. This provides resilience, that is the self-healing capability to
track the target in the presence of low node densities and coverage gaps. The
algorithm is comparatively evaluated against existing approaches through Monte
Carlo simulations which demonstrate its superiority in terms of tracking

Classification performance on imbalanced
datasets is generally poor for the minority class as the classifier cannot

important to classify the minority instances correctly. In this paper, we
present a novel technique based on genetic algorithms, GenSample, for
oversampling the minority class in imbalanced datasets. GenSample decides the
rate of oversampling a minority example by taking into account the difficulty
in learning that example, along with the performance improvement achieved by
oversampling it. This technique terminates the oversampling process when the
performance of the classifier begins to deteriorate. Consequently, it produces
synthetic data only as long as a performance boost is obtained. The algorithm
was tested on 9 real-world imbalanced datasets of varying sizes and imbalance
ratios. It achieved the highest F-Score on 8 out of 9 datasets, confirming its
ability to better handle imbalanced data compared to other existing
methodologies.

complete understanding of the origins of decoherence in nanodiamonds is
critical to improving their performance. Here we present measurements of fast

whenever possible, measurements with NVs in nanodiamonds should be performed at
moderate axial magnetic fields ($>60$ G). We also observe that the qutrit

An attacker location tracker (ALT) is developed to track the location of the

  We propose an approach to duality for the robust linear problems with convex

  With the different ways of arranging data from $({\rm RLIP}_c) $, one gets
back to the model $({\rm RP}_c)$ and the (stable) robust strong duality for
$({\rm RP}_c)$ applies. By such a way, nine versions of dual problems for $

robust strong duality of these pairs of primal-dual problems are given, which
some cover several known results in the literature while the others, due to the
best knowledge of the authors, are new. Moreover, as by-products, we obtained
from the robust strong duality for variants pairs of primal-dual problems,
several robust Farkas-type results for linear infinite systems with
uncertainty.
  Lastly, as applications, we get the results for robust linear problems with
sub-affine constraints, and to linear infinite problems (i.e., $({\rm RLIP}_c)

These instabilities originate in the aliasing of interpolation errors between

Recently, strictly energy-conserving PIC (EC-PIC) algorithms have been
developed that promise enhanced robustness against aliasing instabilities. In
this study, we confirm by analysis that EC-PIC is stable against aliasing
instabilities for stationary plasmas. For drifting plasmas, we demonstrate by
analysis and numerical experiments that, while EC-PIC algorithms are not free
from these instabilities in principle, they feature a benign stability
threshold for finite-temperature plasmas that make them usable in practice for
a large class of problems (featuring ambipolarity and realistic ion-electron

demonstrate that this threshold is absent for the popular momentum-conserving
PIC algorithms, which are therefore unstable for both drifting and stationary

in preserving and providing access to cultural heritage. This paper presents an
integrated system which is able to capture and fabricate color, topography and
gloss of a painting, of which gloss capturing forms the most important
contribution. A 3D imaging system, using fringe-encoded stereo imaging, is
extended to capture spatially-varying gloss, utilizing specular reflectance
polarization. The gloss is measured by sampling the specular reflection around
Brewster's angle, where these reflections are effectively polarized, and can be
separated from the unpolarized, diffuse reflectance. Off-center gloss
measurements are calibrated relative to the center measurement. Off-specular
gloss measurements, following from local variation of the surface normal, are
masked based on the height map and corrected. Shadowed regions, caused by the
3D relief, are treated similarly. The area of a single capture is approximately
180x90mm at a resolution of 25x25micron. Aligned color, height, and gloss tiles
are stitched together, registering overlapping color areas. These maps are
inputs for a 3D printer. Two paintings were reproduced to verify the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system. One painting was scanned
four times, consecutively rotated by 90 degrees, to evaluate the influence of
the scanning system geometric configuration on the gloss measurement.
Experimental results show that the method is sufficiently fast for practical
application. The results can well be used for the purpose of physical
reproduction and other applications needing first-order estimates of the
appearance. Our method to extend appearance scanning with gloss measurements is
a valuable addition in the quest for realistic reproductions, in terms of its
practical applicability and its perceptual added value, when added to color and
topography.

the number and complexity of computational steps involved in the reduction

$m\geq 1$, then the method yields $m$ first integrals along with a check of
which ones are non-trivial via their multipliers. Several examples of
interesting symmetry reductions are considered: travelling waves and similarity

of eyelid openness, they are inherently unable to satisfactorily perform in
real world applications. Detailed eye state estimation is more important, in

correctness and amounts to postponing, or running in parallel, tedious or

relating and reasoning with it is still a predominantly human effort. One of
the key challenges for automated reasoning based on natural-language texts is
the need to extract meaning (semantics) from texts. Natural language
understanding (NLU) systems describe the conversion from a set of natural
language utterances to terms in a particular logic. Tools for the
co-development of grammar and target logic are currently largely missing.
  We will describe the Grammatical Logical Framework (GLF), a combination of
two existing frameworks, in which large parts of a symbolic, rule-based NLU
system can be developed and implemented: the Grammatical Framework (GF) and
MMT. GF is a tool for syntactic analysis, generation, and translation with
complex natural language grammars and MMT can be used to specify logical
systems and to represent knowledge in them. Combining these tools is possible,
because they are based on compatible logical frameworks: Martin-L\""of type
theory and LF. The flexibility of logical frameworks is needed, as NLU research
has not settled on a particular target logic for meaning representation.
Instead, new logics are developed all the time to handle various language
phenomena. GLF allows users to develop the logic and the language parsing
components in parallel, and to connect them for experimentation with the entire
pipeline.

the comfort zone of the logical framework, these definitions may become
cumbersome or infeasible.
  Therefore, the MMT system abstracts even further than previous frameworks: it
assumes no type system or logic at all and allows its kernel algorithms to be
customized by almost arbitrary sets of rules. In particular, this allows
implementing standard logical frameworks like LF in MMT. But it does so without
chaining users to one particular meta-formalism: users can flexibly adapt MMT
whenever the object logic demands it.
  In this paper, we present a series of case studies that do just that,
defining increasingly complex object logics in MMT. We use elegant declarative
logic definitions wherever possible, but inject entirely new rules into the
kernel when necessary. Our experience shows that the MMT approach allows
deriving prototype implementations of very diverse formal systems very easily

models, showing that nuclei were made up of protons and neutrons. In the
1960's, Deep Inelastic Scattering experiments showed that protons and neutrons
had internal structure: quarks and gluons (collectively, partons), and later
experiments showed that the parton momentum distributions are different in
heavy nuclei, compared to those in free nucleons. This difference is not
surprising; partons are sensitive to their environment, and two gluons from
different nucleons may fuse together, for example.
  Understanding how quarks and gluons behave in the nuclear environment is a
significant focus of modern nuclear physics. Recent measurements have provided
us with an improved understanding of how quark and gluon densities are altered
in heavy nuclei. We have also begun to make multi-dimensional pictures of the
nucleus, exploring how these alterations are distributed within heavy nuclei.
We naturally expect these modifications to be largest in the core of a nucleus,
and smaller near its periphery; this can change the effective shape of the
nucleus. We have also started to explore the transverse momentum distribution
of the partons in the nuclei, and, using incoherent photoproduction as a probe,
study event-by-event fluctuations in nucleon and nuclei parton densities.
  This article will explore recent progress in measurements of nuclear
structure at high energy, with some emphasis on these multi-dimensional
pictures. We will also discuss how a future electron-ion collider (EIC) with

suitable for small object tracking, especially aiming for the challenge of
sudden and large drift. We make three-fold contributions in this work. First,
technically, we propose a new descriptor, named aggregation signature, based on
saliency, able to represent highly distinctive features for small objects.
Second, theoretically, we prove that the proposed signature matches the
foreground object more accurately with a high probability. Third,
experimentally, the aggregation signature achieves a high performance on
multiple datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by large margins.

Gaussian MRF is an acyclic graph representing a multivariate Gaussian
distribution, where nodes are random variables and edges represent the
conditional dependence between the connected nodes. Since it is possible to
learn the edge structure of Gaussian MRFs directly from data, Gaussian MRFs
provide an excellent way to understand complex data by revealing the dependence
structure among many inputs features, such as genes, sensors, users, documents,
etc. In learning the graphical structure of Gaussian MRFs, it is desired to
discover the actual edges of the underlying but unknown probabilistic graphical
model-it becomes more complicated when the number of random variables
(features) p increases, compared to the number of data points n. In particular,
when p >> n, it is statistically unavoidable for any estimation procedure to
include false edges. Therefore, there have been many trials to reduce the false
detection of edges, in particular, using different types of regularization on
the learning parameters. Our method makes use of the SL1 regularization,
introduced recently for model selection in linear regression. We focus on the
benefit of SL1 regularization that it can be used to control the FDR of
detecting important random variables. Adapting SL1 for probabilistic graphical
models, we show that SL1 can be used for the structure learning of Gaussian
MRFs using our suggested procedure nsSLOPE (neighborhood selection Sorted L-One

a new algorithm realizing a coded caching scheme for combination network based

assignment. For example, intensive policing on one street could have a
spillover effect on neighboring streets. Classical randomization tests
typically break down in this setting because many null hypotheses of interest
are no longer sharp under interference. A promising alternative is to instead
construct a conditional randomization test on a subset of units and assignments
for which a given null hypothesis is sharp. Finding these subsets is
challenging, however, and existing methods are limited to special cases or have
limited power. In this paper, we propose valid and easy-to-implement
randomization tests for a general class of null hypotheses under arbitrary
interference between units. Our key idea is to represent the hypothesis of
interest as a bipartite graph between units and assignments, and to find an
appropriate biclique of this graph. Importantly, the null hypothesis is sharp
within this biclique, enabling conditional randomization-based tests. We also
connect the size of the biclique to statistical power. Moreover, we can apply
off-the-shelf graph clustering methods to find such bicliques efficiently and
at scale. We illustrate our approach in settings with clustered interference

particular, we study the properties of the null-spaces of the reachability
matrix pencil and of the Rosenbrock system matrix, which have been extensively
used as two computational building blocks for the calculation of pole placing
state feedback matrices and pole placing friends of output-nulling subspaces.
Our objective is to show that the subspaces in the chains of kernels obtained
in the construction of these feedback matrices interact with each other in ways
that are entirely independent from the choice of eigenvalues. So far, these
chains of subspaces have only been studied in the case of stationarity. In this
case, it is known that these chains converge to the classic Kalman reachable
subspace for the reachability matrix pencil and to the largest reachability
subspace in the case of the Rosenbrock matrix, respectively. Here we are
interested in showing that even before stationarity has been reached, the
partial chains are linked to structural properties of the system, and are
therefore independent of the closed-loop eigenvalues that we wish to assign. We
further characterize these subspaces by investigating the notion of largest

physically verifies all the energy transactions, to keep the various inherently

network mechanism for the physical validation of economic transactions cleared
over a distributed ledger. The framework is $\textit{secure}$ in the sense that
selfish and malicious agents that are trying to inject false data into the

(OCO), where the player has a limited number of opportunities to change her
action. While the discrete analog of this online learning task has been studied
extensively, previous work in the continuous setting has neither established
the minimax rate nor algorithmically achieved it. In this paper, we show that $
T $-round switching-constrained OCO with fewer than $ K $ switches has a
minimax regret of $ \Theta(\frac{T}{\sqrt{K}}) $. In particular, it is at least
$ \frac{T}{\sqrt{2K}} $ for one dimension and at least $ \frac{T}{\sqrt{K}} $
for higher dimensions. The lower bound in higher dimensions is attained by an
orthogonal subspace argument. In one dimension, a novel adversarial strategy
yields the lower bound of $O(\frac{T}{\sqrt{K}})$, but a precise minimax
analysis including constants is more involved. To establish the tighter
one-dimensional result, we introduce the \emph{fugal game} relaxation, whose
minimax regret lower bounds that of switching-constrained OCO. We show that the
minimax regret of the fugal game is at least $ \frac{T}{\sqrt{2K}} $ and
thereby establish the optimal minimax lower bound in one dimension. To
establish the dimension-independent upper bound, we next show that a
mini-batching algorithm provides an $ O(\frac{T}{\sqrt{K}}) $ upper bound, and
therefore conclude that the minimax regret of switching-constrained OCO is $
\Theta(\frac{T}{\sqrt{K}}) $ for any $K$. This is in sharp contrast to its
discrete counterpart, the switching-constrained prediction-from-experts
problem, which exhibits a phase transition in minimax regret between the
low-switching and high-switching regimes.

We achieve {competitive} steady-state results with a significant reduction in

considerably larger relaxation factors for the steady-state velocity and

asynchronous if at each time-step only one cell is updated. Given

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.RO cs.MA cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Finding feasible and collision-free paths for multiple nonlinear agents is
challenging in the decentralized scenarios due to limited available information
of other agents and complex dynamics constraints. In this paper, we propose a
fast multi-agent collision avoidance algorithm for general nonlinear agents
with continuous action space, where each agent observes only positions and
velocities of nearby agents. To reduce online computation, we first decompose
the multi-agent scenario and solve a two agents collision avoidance problem
using reinforcement learning (RL). When extending the trained policy to a
multi-agent problem, safety is ensured by introducing the optimal reciprocal
collision avoidance (ORCA) as linear constraints and the overall collision
avoidance action could be found through simple convex optimization. Most
existing RL-based multi-agent collision avoidance algorithms rely on the direct
control of agent velocities. In sharp contrasts, our approach is applicable to
general nonlinear agents. Realistic simulations based on nonlinear bicycle
agent models are performed with various challenging scenarios, indicating a
competitive performance of the proposed method in avoiding collisions,
congestion and deadlock with smooth trajectories.

Unfortunately, verification of entirely uninterpreted programs (with the empty

\emph{coherent} uninterpreted programs, and showed that they admit decidable

coherent verification problem. Axioms include relations being reflexive,
symmetric, transitive, or total order relations, %and their combinations,
functions restricted to being associative, idempotent or commutative, and

coherent programs, coherence is not a panacea as several others continue to be
undecidable.

algorithmic goal is to efficiently infer an unknown feature vector
$\beta^*\in\mathbb{R}^p$ from its linear measurements, using a small number $n$
of samples. Unlike most of the literature, we make no sparsity assumption on
$\beta^*$, but instead adopt a different regularization: In the noiseless
setting, we assume $\beta^*$ consists of entries, which are either rational
numbers with a common denominator $Q\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ (referred to as
$Q$-rationality); or irrational numbers supported on a rationally independent
set of bounded cardinality, known to learner; collectively called as the
mixed-support assumption. Using a novel combination of the PSLQ integer
relation detection, and LLL lattice basis reduction algorithms, we propose a
polynomial-time algorithm which provably recovers a $\beta^*\in\mathbb{R}^p$
enjoying the mixed-support assumption, from its linear measurements
$Y=X\beta^*\in\mathbb{R}^n$ for a large class of distributions for the random
entries of $X$, even with one measurement $(n=1)$. In the noisy setting, we
propose a polynomial-time, lattice-based algorithm, which recovers a

$Y=X\beta^*+W\in\mathbb{R}^n$, even with a single sample $(n=1)$. We further
establish for large $Q$, and normal noise, this algorithm tolerates
information-theoretically optimal level of noise. We then apply these ideas to
develop a polynomial-time, single-sample algorithm for the phase retrieval
problem. Our methods address the single-sample $(n=1)$ regime, where the
sparsity-based methods such as LASSO and Basis Pursuit are known to fail.
Furthermore, our results also reveal an algorithmic connection between the

aspects that enable learning these model parameters are the forward and
backward propagation time of the MRF optimization algorithm and its inference
capabilities. In this work, we introduce two fast and differentiable message
passing algorithms, namely, Iterative Semi-Global Matching Revised (ISGMR) and
Parallel Tree-Reweighted Message Passing (TRWP) which are greatly sped up on a

revised version of the standard SGM for general pairwise MRFs with improved
optimization effectiveness, and TRWP is a highly parallel version of Sequential
TRW (TRWS) for faster optimization. Our experiments on the standard stereo and
denoising benchmarks demonstrated that ISGMR and TRWP achieve much lower
energies than SGM and Mean-Field (MF), and TRWP is two orders of magnitude
faster than TRWS without losing effectiveness in optimization. We further
demonstrated the effectiveness of our algorithms on end-to-end learning for
semantic segmentation. Notably, our CUDA implementations are at least $7$ and

based on recurrent neural networks and optical flow. Despite their complexity,
these kinds of approaches tend to favour short-term temporal dependencies and
are thus prone to accumulating inaccuracies, which cause drift over time.
Moreover, simple (static) image segmentation models, alone, can perform
competitively against these methods, which further suggests that the way
temporal dependencies are modelled should be reconsidered. Motivated by these
observations, in this paper we explore simple yet effective strategies to model
long-term temporal dependencies. Inspired by the non-local operators of [70],
we introduce a technique to establish dense correspondences between pixel
embeddings of a reference ""anchor"" frame and the current one. This allows the
learning of pairwise dependencies at arbitrarily long distances without
conditioning on intermediate frames. Without online supervision, our approach
can suppress the background and precisely segment the foreground object even in
challenging scenarios, while maintaining consistent performance over time. With
a mean IoU of $81.7\%$, our method ranks first on the DAVIS-2016 leaderboard of

the unlabeled dataset via our proposed UIR loss. In order to 'reject' faces of
unknown identities, centers of the known identities are forced to keep enough
margin from centers of unknown identities which are assumed to be approximated
by the features of their samples. By this means, the discriminativeness of the

simulated robot as different tasks. When policies are meta-trained on such
narrow task distributions, they cannot possibly generalize to more quickly
acquire entirely new tasks. Therefore, if the aim of these methods is to enable
faster acquisition of entirely new behaviors, we must evaluate them on task

the use of dilated distance-generating functions enable us to decompose the

algorithms at each information set. This decomposition mirrors the structure of
the counterfactual regret minimization framework, and enables important
techniques in practice, such as distributed updates and pruning of cold parts
of the game tree. Our algorithms provably converge at a rate of $T^{-1}$, which
is superior to prior counterfactual regret minimization algorithms. We
experimentally compare to the popular algorithm CFR+, which has a theoretical
convergence rate of $T^{-0.5}$ in theory, but is known to often converge at a
rate of $T^{-1}$, or better, in practice. We give an example matrix game where
CFR+ experimentally converges at a relatively slow rate of $T^{-0.74}$, whereas
our optimistic methods converge faster than $T^{-1}$. We go on to show that our
fast rate also holds in the Kuhn poker game, which is an extensive-form game.
For games with deeper game trees however, we find that CFR+ is still faster.
Finally we show that when the goal is minimizing regret, rather than computing
a Nash equilibrium, our optimistic methods can outperform CFR+, even in deep

has drawn much attention, since it needs little speaker prior information.
However, it still has much room of improvement, particularly in reverberant
environments. If the training and test environments mismatch which is a common
case, the embedding vectors produced by DPCL may contain much noise and many
small variations. To deal with the problem, we propose a variant of DPCL, named
DPCL++, by applying a recent unsupervised deep learning method---multilayer
bootstrap networks(MBN)---to further reduce the noise and small variations of
the embedding vectors in an unsupervised way in the test stage, which
fascinates k-means to produce a good result. MBN builds a gradually narrowed
network from bottom-up via a stack of k-centroids clustering ensembles, where
the k-centroids clusterings are trained independently by random sampling and
one-nearest-neighbor optimization. To further improve the robustness of DPCL++
in reverberant environments, we take spatial features as part of its input.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

used these methods to quantify the effect that critical hardware components

quantify (a) the relationship between pixel size and the ability to detect cars
at different distances, (b) the penalty for choosing a poor exposure duration,
and (c) the ability of the CNN to perform car detection for a variety of
post-acquisition processing algorithms. These results show that the optimal
choices for car detection are not constrained by the same metrics used for
image quality in consumer photography. It is better to evaluate camera designs

originate both in the jet and in the accretion disk corona. Time variability in
hard X rays furthermore suggests that, as observed in flat-spectrum radio
quasars, the dissipation region during flares could change its position from
source to source, and it can be located both inside and outside the broad-line
region. We find that jetted NLS1s, and other blazars as well, seem not to
follow the classical fundamental plane of black hole activity, which therefore
should be used as a black hole mass estimator in blazars with extreme care
only. Our results strengthen the idea according to which $\gamma$-NLS1s are
smaller and younger version of flat-spectrum radio quasars, in which both a
Seyfert and a blazar component co-exist.

subject of debate. We present a new spin parity catalog of 146 spiral galaxies
that lists the following three pieces of information: whether the spiral
structure observed on the sky is S-wise or Z-wise; which side of the minor axis
of the galaxy is darker and redder, based on examination of Pan-STARRS and/or
ESO/DSS2 red image archives, and which side of the major axis of the galaxy is
approaching to us based on the published literature. This paper confirms that
all of the spiral galaxies in the catalog show a consistent relationship among
these three parameters, without any confirmed counterexamples, that supports
the generally accepted interpretation that all the spiral galaxies are trailing
and that the darker/redder side of the galactic disk is closer to us. Although
the results of this paper may not be surprising, they provide a rationale for
analyzing the S/Z winding distribution of spiral galaxies, using the large and
uniform image data bases available now and in the near future, to study the
spin vorticity distribution of galaxies in order to constrain the formation
scenarios of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the Universe.

origins of the high [OIII]/[CII] ratios at z=6-9 using Cloudy, and find that
high density of the interstellar medium, low C/O abundance ratio, and the

optimization algorithms to be implemented on distributed computational
architectures. A key bottleneck is the communication overhead for exchanging
information, such as stochastic gradients, among different nodes. Recently,
gradient sparsification techniques have been proposed to reduce communications
cost and thus alleviate the network overhead. However, most of gradient
sparsification techniques consider only synchronous parallelism and cannot be
applied in asynchronous scenarios, such as asynchronous distributed training
for federated learning at mobile devices.
  In this paper, we present a dual-way gradient sparsification approach (DGS)
that is suitable for asynchronous distributed training. We let workers download
model difference, instead of the global model, from the server, and the model
difference information is also sparsified so that the information exchanged
overhead is reduced by sparsifying the dual-way communication between the
server and workers. To preserve accuracy under dual-way sparsification, we
design a sparsification aware momentum (SAMomentum) to turn sparsification into
adaptive batch size between each parameter. We conduct experiments at a cluster
of 32 workers, and the results show that, with the same compression ratio but
much lower communication cost, our approach can achieve better scalability and
generalization ability.

enabled high-quality estimation of tissue microstructure from low-quality

These learning-based approaches to tissue microstructure estimation require
acquisitions of training dMRI scans with high-quality diffusion signals, which
are densely sampled in the q-space and have a high spatial resolution. However,
the acquisition of training scans may not be available for all datasets.
Therefore, we explore knowledge transfer between different dMRI datasets so
that learning-based tissue microstructure estimation can be applied for
datasets where training scans are not acquired. Specifically, for a target
dataset of interest, where only low-quality diffusion signals are acquired
without training scans, we exploit the information in a source dMRI dataset
acquired with high-quality diffusion signals. We interpolate the diffusion
signals in the source dataset in the q-space using a dictionary-based signal
representation, so that the interpolated signals match the acquisition scheme
of the target dataset. Then, the interpolated signals are used together with
the high-quality tissue microstructure computed from the source dataset to
train deep networks that perform tissue microstructure estimation for the
target dataset. Experiments were performed on brain dMRI scans with low-quality
diffusion signals, where the benefit of the proposed strategy is demonstrated.

The planning tool coordinates with an operational volt-var optimization tool to
determine all scenarios with voltage violations and verify the planning
results. The planning result of each scenario is the solution of a proposed
optimal power-flow framework with efficient techniques to handle a high number
of discrete variables. The final planning decision is obtained from the
planning results of all selected violated scenarios by using two different
approaches - direct combination of all single-step solutions and final
investment decision based only on the scenarios that are representative for the
power-flow voltage violations at most time steps. The final planning decision
is verified using a realistic large-scale sub-transmission system and 5-minute

with a less investment cost for additional var equipment compared to
conventional approaches.

reveal insights regarding the relations between these two fundamental theories.
Therefore, for the last several decades, nonlocal measurements have stimulated
considerable interest. However, the experimental implementation of nonlocal
measurements imposes profound restrictions due to the fact that the interaction
Hamiltonian cannot contain, in general, nonlocal observables such as the
product of local observables belonging to different particles at
spacelike-separated regions. In this work, we experimentally realize a scheme
for nonlocal measurements with the aid of probabilistic quantum erasure. We
apply this scheme to the tasks of performing high accuracy nonlocal
measurements of the parity, as well as measurements in the Bell basis, which do
not necessitate classical communication between the parties. Unlike other
techniques, the nonlocal measurement outcomes are available locally (upon
successful postselection). The state reconstructed via performing quantum
tomography on the system after the nonlocal measurement indicates the success
of the scheme in retrieving nonlocal information while erasing any local data
previously acquired by the parties. This measurement scheme allows realizing
any controlled-controlled-gate with any coupling strength. Hence our results
are expected to have conceptual and practical applications to quantum
communication and quantum computation.

hypothesis. In a quest to lower teaching complexity and to achieve more natural
teacher-learner interactions, several teaching models and complexity measures
have been proposed for both the batch settings (e.g., worst-case, recursive,
preference-based, and non-clashing models) as well as the sequential settings
(e.g., local preference-based model). To better understand the connections
between these different batch and sequential models, we develop a novel
framework which captures the teaching process via preference functions
$\Sigma$. In our framework, each function $\sigma \in \Sigma$ induces a
teacher-learner pair with teaching complexity as $\TD(\sigma)$. We show that
the above-mentioned teaching models are equivalent to specific types/families
of preference functions in our framework. This equivalence, in turn, allows us
to study the differences between two important teaching models, namely $\sigma$
functions inducing the strongest batch (i.e., non-clashing) model and $\sigma$
functions inducing a weak sequential (i.e., local preference-based) model.
Finally, we identify preference functions inducing a novel family of sequential
models with teaching complexity linear in the VC dimension of the hypothesis
class: this is in contrast to the best known complexity result for the batch

second parameter in galaxy evolution. The topic investigated here is the
relationship between star formation rate (SFR) and galaxy radius ($R_{\rm e}$)
for main-sequence star-forming galaxies. The key observational result is that,
over a wide range of stellar mass and redshift in both CANDELS and SDSS, there
is little trend between SFR and $R_{\rm e}$ at fixed stellar mass. The
Kennicutt-Schmidt law, or any similar density-related star formation law, then
implies that smaller galaxies must have lower gas fractions than larger
galaxies (at fixed $M_{\ast}$), and this is supported by observations of local
star-forming galaxies. We investigate the implication by adopting the
equilibrium ""bathtub"" model: the ISM gas mass is assumed to be constant over
time and the net star formation rate is the difference between the accretion
rate of gas onto the galaxy from the halo and the outflow rate due to winds. To
match the observed null correlation between SFR and radius, the bathtub model
requires that smaller galaxies at fixed mass have weaker galactic winds. Our
hypothesis is that galaxies are a 2-dimensional family whose properties are set
mainly by halo mass and concentration. Galaxy radius and accretion rate
plausibly both depend on halo concentration, which predicts how wind strength
should vary with $R_{\rm e}$ and SFR.

self-consistent renormalization (SCR) theory. By considering zero-point as well
as thermal spin fluctuation under the stationary condition, the specific heat
for each class of the magnetic quantum critical point (QCP) specified by the
dynamical exponent $z=3$ (FM) and $z=2$ (AFM) and the spatial dimension ($d=3$
and $2$) is shown to be expressed as $C_{V}=C_a-C_b$, where $C_a$ is dominant
at low temperatures, reproducing the past SCR criticality endorsed by the
renormalization group theory. Starting from the explicit form of the entropy
and using the Maxwell relation, $\alpha=\alpha_a+\alpha_b$ (with $\alpha_a$ and
$\alpha_b$ being related to $C_a$ and $C_b$, respectively) is derived, which is
proven to be equivalent to $\alpha$ derived from the free energy. The
temperature-dependent coefficient found to exist in $\alpha_b$, which is
dominant at low temperatures, contributes to the crossover from the
quantum-critical regime to the Curie-Weiss regime and even affects the quantum
criticality at 2d AFM QCP. Based on these correctly calculated $C_{V}$ and
$\alpha$, Gr\""{u}neisen parameter $\Gamma=\Gamma_a+\Gamma_b$ is derived, where
$\Gamma_a$ and $\Gamma_b$ contain $\alpha_a$ and $\alpha_b$, respectively. The
inverse susceptibility coupled to the volume $V$ in $\Gamma_b$ gives rise to
divergence of $\Gamma$ at the QCP for each class even though characteristic
energy scale of spin fluctuation $T_0$ is finite at the QCP, which gives a
finite contribution in $\Gamma_a=-\frac{V}{T_0}\left(\frac{\partial
T_0}{\partial V}\right)_{T=0}$. General properties of $\alpha$ and $\Gamma$

via the eight-band k.p theory. For the [111] L-valley, we expand the envelope
wave function using Bessel functions to calculate the energies of the electron
states for the first time. The results show that the energy dispersion curves
of electron states at the L-valley are almost parabolic irrespective of the
radius of Germanium nanowires. Based on the electronic structures, the density
of states of Germanium nanowires are also obtained, and we find that the
conduction band density of states mostly come from the electron states at the
L-valley because of the eight equivalent degenerate L points in Germanium.
Furthermore, the optical gain spectra of Germanium nanowires are investigated.
The calculations show that there are no optical gain along z direction even
though the injected carrier density is 4x1019 cm-3 when the doping
concentration is zero, and a remarkable optical gain can be obtained when the
injected carrier density is close to 1x1020 cm-3, since a large amount of
electrons will prefer to occupy the low-energy L-valley. In this case, the
negative optical gain will be encountered considering free-carrier absorption
loss as the increase of the diameter. We also investigate the optical gain
along z direction as functions of the doping concentration and injected carrier
density for the doped Germanium nanowires. When taking into account
free-carrier absorption loss, the calculated results show that a positive net
peak gain is most likely to occur in the heavily doped nanowires with smaller
diameters. Our theoretical studies are valuable in providing a guidance for the
applications of Germanium nanowires in the field of microelectronics and
optoelectronics.

families. First, features are extracted from byte files using two different
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). After that, essential and

where Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as a classifier. The idea is to
construct a hybrid feature space by combining the different feature spaces to
overcome the shortcoming of particular feature space and thus, reduce the
chances of missing a malware. Finally, the hybrid feature space is used to
train a Multilayer Perceptron, which classifies all nine different malware
families. Experimental results show that proposed DLMD technique achieves
log-loss of 0.09 for ten independent runs. Moreover, the proposed DLMD

differences in hyperpolarized 13C urea T2 relaxation in ischemic and healthy
rodent kidneys. Theory and Methods: Six rats with unilateral renal ischemia
were investigated. 13C urea T2 mapping was undertaken with a radial fast spin
echo method, with subsequent post-processing performed with regularised
Laplacian fitting. Results: Simulations showed that Laplacian fitting was
stable down to a signal to noise ratio of 20. In vivo results showed a
significant increase in the mono- and decrease in bi-exponential pools in IRI
kidneys, in comparison to healthy (14+-10% vs 4+-2%, 85+-10% vs 95+-3%,
p<0.05). Conclusion: We demonstrate, for the first time, the differences in
multi-exponential behaviour of 13C,15N2-urea between the healthy and ischemic
rodent kidney. The distribution of relaxation pools were found to be both
visually and numerically significantly different. The ability to improve the
information level in hyperpolarized MR, by utilizing the relaxation contrast
mechanisms is an appealing option, that can easily be adopted in large animals
and even in clinical studies in the near future.

deal with the heavy meson decays. In the paper, we adopt two different
correlators to derive the light-cone sum rules of the $B \to \pi$ transition
form factors (TFFs) within the framework of HQEFT. We label those two LCSR

correlation parameter $|\rho_{\rm RU}|$ for the branching ratio ${\cal B}(B \to
\pi l \nu_{l})$ is $\sim 0.85$, implying the consistency of the LCSRs under
different correlators. Moreover, we obtain $|V_{\rm ub}|_{{\rm LCSR}-{\cal

Thus the HQEFT provides a useful framework for studying the $B$ meson decays.
Moreover, by using right-handed correlator, the twist-2 terms shall dominant
the TFF $f^+(q^2)$, which approaches over $\sim97\%$ contribution in the whole

their use by avalanche hazard forecasters, or for glaciological and
hydrological studies. The spatialized simulations currently available for
avalanche hazard forecasting are only assimilating sparse meteorological
observations. As suggested by recent studies, their forecasting skills could be
significantly improved by assimilating satellite data such as snow reflectances
from satellites in the visible and the near-infrared spectra. Indeed, these
data can help constrain the microstructural properties of surface snow and
light absorbing impurities content, which in turn affect the surface energy and
mass budgets. This paper investigates the prerequisites of satellite data
assimilation into a detailed snowpack model. An ensemble version of
Meteo-France operational snowpack forecasting system (named S2M) was built for
this study. This operational system runs on topographic classes instead of grid
points, so-called semi-distributed approach. Each class corresponds to one of
the 23 mountain massifs of the French Alps (about 1000km^{2} each), an
altitudinal range (by step of 300m) and aspect (by step of 45{\deg}). We assess
the feasability of satellite data assimilation in such a semi-distributed
geometry. Ensemble simulations are compared with satellite observations from
MODIS and Sentinel-2, and with in-situ reflectance observations. The study
focuses on the 2013-2014 and 2016-2017 winters in the Grandes-Rousses massif.
Substantial Pearson R^{2} correlations (0.75-0.90) of MODIS observations with
simulations are found over the domain. This suggests that assimilating it could
have an impact on the spatialized snowpack forecasting system. However,
observations contain significant biases (0.1-0.2 in reflectance) which prevent
their direct assimilation. MODIS spectral band ratios seem to be much less
biased.

unsupervised deep model, named multilayer bootstrap network (MBN), to further
process the embedding vectors of speech segments for the above problem. MBN is
an unsupervised deep model for nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Unlike
traditional neural network based deep model, it is a stack of $k$-centroids

the related reactions including the isomerization and decomposition on the C5H7
potential energy surface were systematically investigated by theoretical
calculations. High-level ab initio calculations were adopted to obtain the
stationary points on the potential energy surfaces of CPD + H. Phenomenological
rate coefficients for temperature- and pressure-dependent reactions in the full
potential energy surface were calculated by solving the time-dependent
multiple-well RRKM/master equation, and the hydrogen abstraction reactions were
based on the conventional transition state theory. In terms of the hydrogen
abstraction reactions, the hydrogen abstraction from the saturated carbon atom
in CPD is found to be the dominant channel. For the hydrogen addition and the
associated reactions on the C5H7 PES, the allylic and vinylic cyclopentenyl
radicals and C2H2 + C3H5 were found to be the most important channels and
reactivity-promoting products, respectively. The previously neglected role of
open-chain intermediates in the evaluation of the reaction kinetics has been
suggested and the corresponding rate constants have been recommended for
inclusion in the modeling of the H+ c-C5H6 reaction. Results indicate that the
transformation from to straight-chain C5H7 is kinetically unfavorable due to
the high strain energy of the 3-membered ring structure of the isomerization
transition state. Moreover, the thermodynamic data and the calculated rate
coefficients for both H atom abstraction and addition were incorporated into

investigate the correlation between quiescent galaxy fraction of galaxy
overdensities and their surrounding LSSs, with a larger sample of ~ 20

show a lower fraction of quiescent galaxies (~ 20 %) than isolated ones at
similar redshifts (with a quiescent galaxy fraction of ~ 50 %). Furthermore, we
find a possible indication that clusters/groups with a high quiescent galaxy

that LSSs are the main reservoirs of gas and star-forming galaxies to keep
galaxy clusters fresh and extended in size at z ~ 1.

spatially homogeneous, temporally varying systems. In addition to the usual
mass shells, the Wightman functions display additional coherence shells around
zero frequency $k_0=0$, which carry the information of the local quantum
coherence of particle-antiparticle pairs. We find also other structures, which
encode non-local correlations in time, and discuss their role and decoherence.
We give a simple derivation of the cQPA formalism, a set of quantum transport
equations, that can be used to study interacting systems including the local
quantum coherence. We compute quantum currents created by a temporal change in
a particle's mass, comparing the exact Wightman function approach, the cQPA and
the semiclassical methods. We find that the semiclassical approximation, which
is fully encompassed by the cQPA, works surprisingly well even for very sharp
temporal features. This is encouraging for the application of semiclassical
methods in electroweak baryogenesis with strong phase transitions.

appear in a wide range of important mathematical and physical problems. Thus,
the question of recognizing a given non-autonomous recurrence as a discrete
Painlev\'e equation and determining its type according to Sakai's
classification scheme, understanding whether it is equivalent to some known
(model) example, and especially finding an explicit change of coordinates
transforming it to such an example, becomes one of the central ones.
Fortunately, Sakai's geometric theory provides an almost algorithmic procedure
for answering this question. In this paper we illustrate this procedure by
studying an example coming from the theory of discrete orthogonal polynomials.
There are many connections between orthogonal polynomials and Painlev\'e
equations, both differential and discrete. In particular, often the
coefficients of three-term recurrence relations for discrete orthogonal
polynomials can be expressed in terms of solutions of discrete Painlev\'e
equations. In this work we study discrete orthogonal polynomials with general
hypergeometric weight and show that their recurrence coefficients satisfy,
after some change of variables, the standard discrete Painlev\'e-V equation. We
also provide an explicit change of variables transforming this equation to the
standard form.

ongoing learning. By contrast, dramatic performance degradation is observed
when new tasks are added to an existing neural network model. This phenomenon,
termed as \emph{Catastrophic Forgetting}, is one of the major roadblocks that
prevent deep neural networks from achieving human-level artificial
intelligence. Several research efforts, e.g. \emph{Lifelong} or
\emph{Continual} learning algorithms, have been proposed to tackle this
problem. However, they either suffer from an accumulating drop in performance
as the task sequence grows longer, or require to store an excessive amount of
model parameters for historical memory, or cannot obtain competitive
performance on the new tasks. In this paper, we focus on the incremental
multi-task image classification scenario. Inspired by the learning process of
human students, where they usually decompose complex tasks into easier goals,
we propose an adversarial feature alignment method to avoid catastrophic
forgetting. In our design, both the low-level visual features and high-level
semantic features serve as soft targets and guide the training process in
multiple stages, which provide sufficient supervised information of the old
tasks and help to reduce forgetting. Due to the knowledge distillation and
regularization phenomenons, the proposed method gains even better performance
than finetuning on the new tasks, which makes it stand out from other methods.
Extensive experiments in several typical lifelong learning scenarios
demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both
accuracies on new tasks and performance preservation on old tasks.

interpolating the pollen based land-cover reconstructions we aim at obtaining
maps that provide both past natural land-cover and the anthropogenic land-cover

using a latent Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRF) for the interpolation.
Estimation of the model is based on a block updated Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) algorithm. The sparse precision matrix of the GMRF together with an
adaptive Metropolis adjusted Langevin step allows for fast inference.
Uncertainties in the land-use predictions are computed from the MCMC posterior
samples. The model uses the pollen based observations to reconstruct three
composition of land cover; Coniferous forest, Broadleaved forest and
Unforested/Open land. The unforested land is then further decomposed into
natural and human induced openness by inclusion of the estimates of past human

single electron spin qubit, singlet-triplet spin qubit, or a three electrons
architecture, e. g. the hybrid qubit. For each qubit type, we study the single
qubit rotations along the principal axis of Bloch sphere including the
mandatory non-idealities of the control signals that realize the gate
operations. The realistic transient of the control signal pulses are obtained
by adopting an appropriate low-pass filter function. In addition the effect of
disturbances on the input signals is taken into account by using a Gaussian
noise model.

stepping towards a greater ambition -- movie understanding. However, compared
to those activity videos in conventional datasets, movies are significantly
different. Generally, movies are much longer and consist of much richer
temporal structures. More importantly, the interactions among characters play a
central role in expressing the underlying story. To facilitate the efforts
along this direction, we construct a dataset called Movie Synopses Associations
(MSA) over 327 movies, which provides a synopsis for each movie, together with
annotated associations between synopsis paragraphs and movie segments. On top
of this dataset, we develop a framework to perform matching between movie
segments and synopsis paragraphs. This framework integrates different aspects
of a movie, including event dynamics and character interactions, and allows
them to be matched with parsed paragraphs, based on a graph-based formulation.
Our study shows that the proposed framework remarkably improves the matching
accuracy over conventional feature-based methods. It also reveals the
importance of narrative structures and character interactions in movie
understanding.

has been widely applied in mental state analysis. Existing work on AU
recognition usually requires big face dataset with AU labels; however, manual
AU annotation requires expertise and can be time-consuming. In this work, we
propose a semi-supervised approach for AU recognition utilizing a large number
of web face images without AU labels and a relatively small face dataset with
AU annotations inspired by the co-training methods. Unlike traditional
co-training methods that require provided multi-view features and model
re-training, we propose a novel co-training method, namely multi-label
co-regularization, for semi-supervised facial AU recognition. Two deep neural
networks are utilized to generate multi-view features for both labeled and
unlabeled face images, and a multi-view loss is designed to enforce the two
feature generators to get conditional independent representations. In order to
constrain the prediction consistency of the two views, we further propose a
multi-label co-regularization loss by minimizing the distance of the predicted
AU probability distributions of two views. In addition, prior knowledge of the
relationship between individual AUs is embedded through a graph convolutional
network (GCN) for exploiting useful information from the big unlabeled dataset.
Experiments on several benchmarks show that the proposed approach can
effectively leverage large datasets of face images without AU labels to improve
the AU recognition accuracy and outperform the state-of-the-art semi-supervised

assumptions, we derive a no-go result showing that no black hole solution can
be constructed from such a seed GR solution. Then, taking into account the
stability of each degeneracy classes of quadratic DHOST theories under a
general disformal mapping, we consider two kinds of known black hole solutions
as seed configurations: the Schwarzschild stealth solution and the non-stealth
Reissner-Nordstrom like solution. Restricting our considerations to invertible
disformal transformations, we show that building new hairy black hole solutions
from the stealth solution associated to a constant kinetic term is also quite
constrained. We obtain new solutions which either are stealth or describe
asymptotically locally flat black holes with a deficit solid angle. However,
starting from the non-stealth seed solution associated to a non constant
kinetic term as well as a time-dependent scalar profile, we show that a
disformal transformation can introduce rather general modifications of the
exterior geometry. Finally, we consider the construction of minimally modified
hairy black hole solutions using a small disformal transformation. Further
applications of this solution generating method should allow to provide new
hairy rotating black hole solutions beyond the stealth sector useful for
phenomenological investigations of compact objects beyond GR.

relationship is observed between the Na adsorption energy on P-doped graphene

with global rotation, drives a mean flow in the form of a horizontally
invariant Ekman-Stokes spiral. We show that the latter can be subject to an
instability that triggers the appearance of an additional
horizontally-structured cellular flow. We determine the instability threshold
numerically, in terms of the Rossby number Ro associated to the Stokes drift of
the waves and the Ekman number E. We confirm the numerical results through
asymptotic expansions at both large and low Ekman number. At large E the
instability reduces to that of a standard Ekman spiral driven by the
wave-induced surface stress instead of a wind stress, while at low E the
Stokes-drift profile crucially determines the shape of the unstable mode. In
both limits the instability threshold asymptotes to an Ekman-number-independent
critical Rossby number, which in both cases also corresponds to a critical
Reynolds number associated to the Lagrangian base-flow velocity profile.

The numerical precision we obtain with the LLR method allows us to determine

a change of behaviour of the overlap free energy is clearly visible as the
chemical potential crosses a critical value. Using fits inspired by the
approximate validity of mean-field theory, which is confirmed by our
simulations, we extract the critical chemical potential as the non-analyticity
point in the overlap free energy, obtaining a value that is in agreement with
other determinations. Implications of our findings and potential improvements

in network analysis. Hence, many (sequential and parallel) algorithms to
compute or approximate betweenness have been devised. Recent algorithmic
advances have made it possible to approximate betweenness very efficiently on
shared-memory architectures. Yet, the best shared-memory algorithms can still
take hours of running time for large graphs, especially for graphs with a high
diameter or when a small relative error is required.
  In this work, we present an MPI-based generalization of the state-of-the-art
shared-memory algorithm for betweenness approximation. This algorithm is based
on adaptive sampling; our parallelization strategy can be applied in the same
manner to adaptive sampling algorithms for other problems. In experiments on a
16-node cluster, our MPI-based implementation is by a factor of 16.1x faster
than the state-of-the-art shared-memory implementation when considering our
parallelization focus -- the adaptive sampling phase -- only. For the complete
algorithm, we obtain an average (geom. mean) speedup factor of 7.4x over the
state of the art. For some previously very challenging inputs, this speedup is
much higher. As a result, our algorithm is the first to approximate betweenness
centrality on graphs with several billion edges in less than ten minutes with
high accuracy.

exponential family with pairwise interactions. The topological distinction
between a torus and Euclidean space has several important consequences.
  Our development was motivated by the problem of identifying phase coupling
among oscillatory signals recorded from multiple electrodes in the brain:
oscillatory phases across electrodes might tend to advance or recede together,
indicating coordination across brain areas. The data analyzed here consisted of
24 phase angles measured repeatedly across 840 experimental trials
(replications) during a memory task, where the electrodes were in 4 distinct
brain regions, all known to be active while memories are being stored or
retrieved. In realistic numerical simulations, we found that a standard
pairwise assessment, known as phase locking value, is unable to describe
multivariate phase interactions, but that torus graphs can accurately identify
conditional associations. Torus graphs generalize several more restrictive
approaches that have appeared in various scientific literatures, and produced
intuitive results in the data we analyzed. Torus graphs thus unify multivariate
analysis of circular data and present fertile territory for future research.

here called syntonets, taking into account the consonances and dissonances
between notes as defined by scale temperaments. Though the fundamental
frequency is usually considered, in real-world sounds several additional
frequencies (partials) accompany the respective fundamental, influencing both
timber and consonance between simultaneous notes. We use a method based on
Helmholtz's consonance approach to quantify the consonances and dissonances
between each of the pairs of notes in a given temperament. We adopt two
distinct partials structures: (i) harmonic; and (ii) shifted, obtained by
taking the harmonic components to a given power $\beta$, which is henceforth
called the anharmonicity index. The latter type of sounds is more realistic in
the sense that they reflect non-linearities implied by real-world instruments.
When these consonances/dissonances are estimated along several octaves,
respective syntonets can be obtained, in which nodes and weighted edge
represent notes, and consonance/dissonance, respectively. The obtained results
are organized into two main groups, those related to network science and
musical theory. Regarding the former group, we have that the syntonets can
provide, for varying values of $\beta$, a wide range of topologies spanning the
space comprised between traditional models. Indeed, it is suggested here that
syntony may provide a kind of universal complex network model. The musical
interpretations of the results include the confirmation of the more regular
consonance pattern of the equal temperament, obtained at the expense of a wider
range of consonances such as that in the meantone temperament. We also have
that scales derived for shifted partials tend to have a wider range of
consonances/dissonances, depending on the temperament and anharmonicity
strength.

2D nanoring that is placed into the combination of the transverse uniform
magnetic field $\bf B$ and the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux $\phi_{AB}$ and whose
potential profile is modelled by the superposition of the quadratic and inverse
quadratic dependencies on the radius $r$. Position (momentum) R\'{e}nyi entropy
depends on the field $B$ as a negative (positive) logarithm of
$\omega_{eff}\equiv\left(\omega_0^2+\omega_c^2/4\right)^{1/2}$, where
$\omega_0$ determines the quadratic steepness of the confining potential and
$\omega_c$ is a cyclotron frequency. This makes the sum
${R_\rho}_{nm}(\alpha)+{R_\gamma}_{nm}(\frac{\alpha}{2\alpha-1})$ a
field-independent quantity that increases with the principal $n$ and azimuthal
$m$ quantum numbers and does satisfy corresponding uncertainty relation.
Analytic expression for the lower boundary of the semi-infinite range of the
dimensionless coefficient $\alpha$ where the momentum entropies exist reveals
that it depends on the ring geometry, AB intensity and quantum number $m$. It
is proved that there is the only orbital for which both R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis
uncertainty relations turn into the identity at $\alpha=1/2$ and which is not
necessarily the lowest-energy level. At any coefficient $\alpha$, the
dependence of the position R\'{e}nyi entropy on the AB flux mimics the energy
variation with $\phi_{AB}$ what, under appropriate scaling, can be used for the
unique determination of the associated persistent current. Similarities and
differences between the two entropies and their uncertainty relations are
discussed too.

widely accepted in the modern literature, rather than being bearers of truth

their truth values can be regarded as no more than degenerate probabilities
(i.e., ones that have only the values 0 and 1). The mathematical motivation for
precedence of probabilistic semantics over propositional semantic for the logic
of experimental quantum propositions is Gleason's theorem. It proves that the
theory of probability measures on closed linear subspaces of a Hilbert space
(which represent experimental quantum propositions) does not admit any
probability measure having only the values 0 and 1. -- By contrast, in the
present paper, it is proclaimed that experimental propositions about quantum
systems are primary bearers of truth values. As this paper demonstrates,
algebraic properties of separable Hilbert spaces of finite dimension equal or
greater than 2 do not allow in valuations (that is, truth assignments) which
are dispersion-free, i.e., total functions from the set of atomic propositions
to the set of two objects, true and false. Providing a probability function can
be interpreted as a measure of the (un)certainty in the assignment of truth
values, the fact that valuations cannot be dispersion-free gives rise to
probabilistic semantics for the logic of experimental quantum propositions.

dominant form of relaxation for spins, given suitably strong spin-cavity
coupling. In this regime, the cavity electromagnetic field takes over from the

spin temperature independently from that of the lattice, by engineering a
suitable cavity field. Here, we report on precisely such control over spin

operator techniques directly linked to the characteristic function of the
probability distribution. The method is illustrated in atomic nuclei. The
nature of the particle number fluctuations from small to large volumes compared
to the system size are carefully analyzed in three cases: normal systems,
superfluid systems and superfluid systems with total particle number
restoration. The transition from Poissonian distribution in the small volume
limit to Gaussian fluctuations as the number of particles participating to the

the system. While the restoration of total number of particles is not necessary
for small volume, we show that it affects the counting statistics as soon as

deep learning models to do real-time segmentation for surgical instruments due

propose an attention-guided lightweight network (LWANet), which can segment
surgical instruments in real-time. LWANet adopts encoder-decoder architecture,
where the encoder is the lightweight network MobileNetV2, and the decoder
consists of depthwise separable convolution, attention fusion block, and
transposed convolution. Depthwise separable convolution is used as the basic
unit to construct the decoder, which can reduce the model size and
computational costs. Attention fusion block captures global contexts and
encodes semantic dependencies between channels to emphasize target regions,
contributing to locating the surgical instrument. Transposed convolution is
performed to upsample feature maps for acquiring refined edges. LWANet can
segment surgical instruments in real-time while takes little computational
costs. Based on 960*544 inputs, its inference speed can reach 39 fps with only
3.39 GFLOPs. Also, it has a small model size and the number of parameters is
only 2.06 M. The proposed network is evaluated on two datasets. It achieves

enhance the signal impinging from the speaker location which is then used to

that requires specialized hardware for efficient computation. One of the most
limiting bottleneck of CNN training is the memory cost associated with storing
the activation values of hidden layers needed for the computation of the

Recently, reversible architectures have been proposed to reduce the memory cost
of training large CNN by reconstructing the input activation values of hidden
layers from their output during the backward pass, circumventing the need to
accumulate these activations in memory during the forward pass. In this paper,
we push this idea to the extreme and analyze reversible network designs
yielding minimal training memory footprint. We investigate the propagation of
numerical errors in long chains of invertible operations and analyze their
effect on training. We introduce the notion of pixel-wise memory cost to
characterize the memory footprint of model training, and propose a new model
architecture able to efficiently train arbitrarily deep neural networks with a
minimum memory cost of 352 bytes per input pixel. This new kind of architecture
enables training large neural networks on very limited memory, opening the door
for neural network training on embedded devices or non-specialized hardware.

computationally-limited settings. There has thus been a demand of compression
techniques for neural networks. Several proposal in this direction have been
made, which famously include hashing-based methods and pruning-based ones.
However, the evaluation of the efficacy of these techniques has so far been
heterogeneous, with no clear evidence in favor of any of them over the others.
The goal of this work is to address this latter issue by providing a
comparative study. While most previous studies test the capability of a
technique in reducing the number of parameters of state-of-the-art networks ,
we follow [CWT + 15] in evaluating their performance on basic ar-chitectures on
the MNIST dataset and variants of it, which allows for a clearer analysis of
some aspects of their behavior. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
to directly compare famous approaches such as HashedNet, Optimal Brain Damage

against equivalent-size feed-forward neural networks with simple
(fully-connected) and structural (convolutional) neural networks. Rather
surprisingly, our experiments show that (iterative) pruning-based methods are
substantially better than the HashedNet architecture, whose compression doesn't
appear advantageous to a carefully chosen convolutional network. We also show
that, when the compression level is high, the famous OBD pruning heuristics
deteriorates to the point of being less efficient than simple magnitude-based

the fixed-order matching conditions as a boundary for the QCD evolution and the
result obtained is compared to the distributions defined by the matching
conditions at all scales. With such an approach, the effect of heavy-quark PDF
evolution is found to be sizable at LO and dramatically reduces at NLO. The
NNLO evolved distributions are not very different from the NLO ones at large

the additional large logarithms are numerically not important, while a mismatch
between the NLO accuracy of the matching conditions and the NNLO accuracy in
the evolution kernels causes a substantial excess in the heavy-quark
distributions. This excess propagates into the variable flavor number (VFN)
scheme predictions for the deep-inelastic structure functions and has to be
compensated by a decrease in the small-$x$ gluon distribution determined from
PDF fits based on the VFN scheme, which should be considered as a theoretical
uncertainty in VFN PDF fits and reaches $\sim 30\%$ for the small-$x$ gluon

forms near the inner resonance (2-1) and extends to the planetary orbit radius

combined with dissipation which inhibits the crossing of streamlines. Spiral
density enhancements result from the crowding of streamlines due to the gradual

PDS 70 is a young (5.4 Myr), nearby (~113 pc) star hosting a known
transition disk with a large gap. Recent observations with SPHERE and NACO in
the near-infrared (NIR) allowed us to detect a planetary mass companion,
PDS70b, within the disk cavity. Moreover, observations in H_alpha with MagAO
and MUSE revealed emission associated to PDS70b and to another new companion
candidate, PDS70c, at a larger separation from the star. Aims. Our aim is to
confirm the discovery of the second planet PDS70c using SPHERE at VLT, to
further characterize its physical properties, and search for additional point
sources in this young planetary system. Methods. We re-analyzed archival SPHERE
NIR observations and obtained new data in Y, J, H and K spectral bands for a
total of four different epochs. The data were reduced using the data reduction
and handling pipeline and the SPHERE data center. We then applied custom
routines (e.g. ANDROMEDA and PACO) to subtract the starlight. Results. We
re-detect both PDS 70 b and c and confirm that PDS70c is gravitationally bound
to the star. We estimate this second planet to be less massive than 5 M Jup and
with a T_eff around 900 K. Also, it has a low gravity with log g between 3.0
and 3.5 dex. In addition, a third object has been identified at short
separation (~0.12"") from the star and gravitationally bound to the star. Its
spectrum is however very blue, so that we are probably seeing stellar light
reflected by dust and our analysis seems to demonstrate that it is a feature of
the inner disk. We, however, cannot completely exclude the possibility that it
is a planetary mass object enshrouded by a dust envelope. In this latter case,
its mass should be of the order of few tens of M_Earth. Moreover, we propose a
possible structure for the planetary system based on our data that, however,
cannot be stable on a long timescale.

while splicing in turn is involved in tumour formations nearly as frequently as
DNA mutations. Yet, the impact of meDNA on tumorigenesis via its effect on
splicing has not been thoroughly explored. Here, we find that HCT116 colon
carcinoma cells inactivated for the DNA methylases DNMT1 and DNMT3b undergo a
partial epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) associated with alternative
splicing of the CD44 transmembrane receptor. The skipping of CD44 variant exons
is in part explained by altered expression or splicing of splicing and
chromatin factors. A direct effect of meDNA on alternative splicing was
sustained by transient depletion of DNMT1 and the methyl-binding genes MBD1,
MBD2, and MBD3. Yet, local changes in intragenic meDNA also altered recruitment
of MBD1 protein and of the chromatin factor HP1$\gamma$ known to alter
transcriptional pausing and alternative splicing decisions. We further tested
if meDNA level has sufficiently strong direct impact on the outcome of
alternative splicing to have a predictive value in the MCF10A model for breast
cancer progression and in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B ALL).
We found that a small number of differentially spliced genes mostly involved in
splicing and signal transduction is systematically correlated with local meDNA.
Altogether, our observations suggest that, although DNA methylation has
multiple avenues to alternative splicing, its indirect effect may be also
mediated through alternative splicing isoforms of these sensors of meDNA.

Interestingly, EEG and MEG differ in their slopes, which could be explained by
several mechanisms, including non-resistive properties of tissues. Our goal in
the present study is to estimate the impact of space/frequency structure of
source signals as a putative mechanism to explain spectral scaling properties
of neuroimaging signals. We performed simulations based on the summed
contribution of cortical patches with different sizes (ranging from 0.4 to
104.2 cm 2). Small patches were attributed signals of high frequencies, whereas
large patches were associated with signals of low frequencies, on a logarithmic
scale. The tested parameters included i) the space/frequency structure (range
of patch sizes and frequencies) and ii) the amplitude factor c parametrizing
the spatial scale ratios. We found that the space/frequency structure may cause
differences between EEG and MEG scale-free spectra that are compatible with
real data findings reported in previous studies. We also found that below a
certain spatial scale, there were no more differences between EEG and MEG,
suggesting a limit for the resolution of both methods. Our work provides an
explanation of experimental findings. This does not rule out other mechanisms
for differences between EEG and MEG, but suggests an important role of
spatio-temporal structure of neural dynamics. This can help the analysis and
interpretation of power-law measures in EEG and MEG, and we believe our results
can also impact computational modeling of brain dynamics, where different local

transistor-like response of the pressure induced ionic streaming: an applied
bias of a fraction of a volt results in an enhancement of the streaming
mobility by up to 20 times. The gating effect is observed with both graphite

observations are rationalized by a theoretical framework for the flow dynamics,
including the frictional interaction of water, ions and the confining surfaces
as a key ingredient. The material dependence of the voltage modulation can be
traced back to a contrasting molecular friction on graphene and boron nitride.
The highly nonlinear transport under molecular-scale confinement offers new
routes to actively control molecular and ion transport and design elementary
building blocks for artificial ionic machinery, such as ion pumps. Furthermore,
it provides a versatile platform to explore electro-mechanical couplings

diversity of the real world. Methods based on high-capacity models, such as

range of open-world environments. However, these same methods typically require
large amounts of diverse training data to generalize effectively. In contrast,
most robotic learning experiments are small-scale, single-domain, and
single-robot. This leads to a frequent tension in robotic learning: how can we
learn generalizable robotic controllers without having to collect impractically
large amounts of data for each separate experiment? In this paper, we propose
RoboNet, an open database for sharing robotic experience, which provides an
initial pool of 15 million video frames, from 7 different robot platforms, and
study how it can be used to learn generalizable models for vision-based robotic
manipulation. We combine the dataset with two different learning algorithms:
visual foresight, which uses forward video prediction models, and supervised
inverse models. Our experiments test the learned algorithms' ability to work
across new objects, new tasks, new scenes, new camera viewpoints, new grippers,
or even entirely new robots. In our final experiment, we find that by
pre-training on RoboNet and fine-tuning on data from a held-out Franka or Kuka
robot, we can exceed the performance of a robot-specific training approach that
uses 4x-20x more data. For videos and data, see the project webpage:

To solve these problems, it
is important to leverage the structure information. This paper focuses on
convex problems with a finite-sum compositional structure. Finite-sum problems
appear as the sample average approximation of a stochastic optimization problem
and also arise in machine learning with a huge amount of training data. One
popularly used numerical approach for finite-sum problems is the stochastic
gradient method (SGM). However, the additional compositional structure
prohibits easy access to unbiased stochastic approximation of the gradient, so
directly applying the SGM to a finite-sum compositional optimization problem
(COP) is often inefficient.
  We design new algorithms for solving strongly-convex and also convex
two-level finite-sum COPs. Our design incorporates the Katyusha acceleration
technique and adopts the mini-batch sampling from both outer-level and
inner-level finite-sum. We first analyze the algorithm for strongly-convex
finite-sum COPs. Similar to a few existing works, we obtain linear convergence
rate in terms of the expected objective error, and from the convergence rate
result, we then establish complexity results of the algorithm to produce an
$\varepsilon$-solution. Our complexity results have the same dependence on the
number of component functions as existing works. However, due to the use of
Katyusha acceleration, our results have better dependence on the condition
number $\kappa$ and improve to $\kappa^{2.5}$ from the best-known $\kappa^3$.
Finally, we analyze the algorithm for convex finite-sum COPs, which uses as a
subroutine the algorithm for strongly-convex finite-sum COPs. Again, we obtain
better complexity results than existing works in terms of the dependence on
$\varepsilon$, improving to $\varepsilon^{-2.5}$ from the best-known
$\varepsilon^{-3}$.

our results cast some doubt on the utility of multi-task setups with linguistic

prove ineffective in large data settings. The treatment of self-attention as

that Transformer model can very easily grasp the syntactic structure. An
important but curious result is, however, that identical gains are obtained by
using trivial ""linear trees"" instead of true dependencies. The reason for the
gain thus may not be coming from the added linguistic knowledge but from some
simpler regularizing effect we induced on self-attention matrices.

interacting quantum wire with a proximity induced pairing term. We solve the
system exactly by Bethe Ansatz and show that for certain boundary conditions
the spectrum contains bound states localized about either edge. The model is
shown to exhibit a first order phase transition as a function of the
interaction strength such that for attractive interactions the ground state has
bound states at both ends of the wire while for repulsive interactions they are
absent. In addition we see that the bound state energy lies within the gap for
all values of the interaction strength but undergoes a sharp avoided level
crossing for sufficiently strong interaction, thereby preventing its decay.
This avoided crossing is shown to occur as a consequence of an exact
self-duality which is present in the model.

waveguide modes. We identify here the mechanisms behind this effect. We
consider emitters near a waveguide, either centered on the median plane of the
waveguide, or displaced from such plane. We show that, independently of the
displacement, the directionality is mostly due to a mirror symmetry breaking
caused by the axial character of the angular momentum of the emitted light. The
sign of the angular momentum along an axis transverse to the waveguide
determines the preferential coupling direction. The degree of directionality
grows exponentially as the magnitude of such transverse angular momentum
increases linearly. We trace this exponential dependence back to a property of
the evanescent angular spectrum of the emissions. A binary and less pronounced
directional coupling effect due to the chiral character of the handedness of
the emission is possible when the displacement of the emitter breaks another of
the mirror symmetries of the waveguide. We find a selection rule that allows or
prevents the coupling of centered electric(magnetic) multipolar emissions onto
the waveguide modes. We also show that the selection of a different angular
momentum axis made in some experiments causes significant differences in the
way in which directionality depends on angular momentum. We then use these
differences to propose an experiment featuring a transverse magnetic bias that
allows to aggregate the directional emissions from quantum dots on top of
waveguides. Our symmetry-based results apply to any emitted multipolar order,
clarify the spin-momentum locking concept, and generalize it to an
exponentially-strong locking between the transverse angular momentumand the
preferential coupling direction.

interaction with plasmons, the collective electronic modes appearing in metals
and semiconductors. This confinement, which is particularly important in the
terahertz spectral region, amplifies light-matter interaction and provides a
powerful mechanism for efficiently generating non-linear optical phenomena.
These effects are particularly relevant in Dirac materials like graphene and
Topological Insulators, where massless fermions show a naturally non-linear
optical behavior in the terahertz range. The strong interaction scenario has
been considered so far from the point of view of light. In this paper, we
investigate instead the effect of strong interaction on the plasmon itself. In
particular, we will show that Dirac plasmons in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ Topological
Insulator are strongly renormalized when excited by high-intensity terahertz
radiation by displaying a huge red-shift down to 60% of its characteristic
frequency. This opens the road towards tunable terahertz non-linear optical
devices based on Topological Insulators.

WCrY alloy is analysed with low energy ion scattering of He+ ions with an
energy of 1 keV in the temperature range from room temperature to 1000 K. Due
to the high surface sensitivity, these measurements probe only the composition
of the outermost monolayer. The surface concentration of Cr increases slightly
when the temperature of the sample is increased up to 700 K and exhibits a much
stronger increase when the sample temperature is further raised. The
segregation enthalpy for Cr is obtained from the Langmuir-McLean relation and
amounts to 0.7 eV. The surface concentration of Y shows a similar behaviour to
the Cr concentration. The temperature thresholds between slow and accelerated
surface density increases for Cr and Y are nearly the same. At a temperature of
1000 K the low energy ion scattering detects almost no W on the surface. The
modified surface composition due to the segregated species, i.e. the mixed Cr/Y
layer, stays stable during cool-down of the sample. Preferential sputtering is
investigated using ion bombardment of 250 eV D atoms, resulting in an increase
of the W surface density at room temperature. This effect is counteracted at
elevated temperatures where segregation replenishes the lighter elements on the
surface and prevents the formation of an all-W surface layer. The flux of
segregating Cr atoms towards the surface is evaluated from the equilibrium
between sputter erosion and segregation.

in six Chandra/HETG observations of the black hole candidate 4U~1630$-$472,
covering a range of luminosities over two distinct spectral states. We modeled
both wind absorption and extended wind re-emission components using PION, a
self-consistent photoionized absorption model. In all but one case, two
photoionization zones were required in order to obtain acceptable fits. Two
independent constraints on launching radii, obtained via the ionization
parameter formalism and the dynamical broadening of the re-emission, helped
characterize the geometry of the wind. The innermost wind components ($r \simeq
{10}^{2-3}$ $GM/{c}^{2}$) tend towards small volume filling factors, high
ionization, densities up to $n \simeq {10}^{15-16} {\text{cm}}^{-3}$, and
outflow velocities of $\sim 0.003c$. These small launching radii and large
densities require magnetic driving, as they are inconsistent with numerical and
analytical treatments of thermally driven winds. Outer wind components ($r
\simeq {10}^{5}$ $GM/{c}^{2}$) are significantly less ionized and have filling
factors near unity. Their larger launching radii, lower densities ($n \simeq
{10}^{12} {\text{cm}}^{-3}$), and outflow velocities ($\sim 0.0007c$) are
nominally consistent with thermally driven winds. The overall wind structure
suggests that these components may also be part of a broader MHD outflow and
perhaps better described as magneto-thermal hybrid winds.

but also can release electromagnetic signatures in multiple wavelengths. Within
the first half of the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and Virgo

binary systems for which at least one component is potentially a neutron star.
In this article, we look at the candidates S190425z, S190426c, S190510g,

in more detail. All these triggers have been followed up with extensive
campaigns by the astronomical community doing electromagnetic searches for
their optical counterparts; however, according to the released classification,
there is a high probability that some of these events might not be of
extraterrestrial origin. Assuming that the triggers are caused by a compact
binary coalescence and that the individual source locations have been covered
during the EM follow-up campaigns, we employ three different kilonova models
and apply them to derive possible constraints on the matter ejection consistent
with the publicly available gravitational-wave trigger information and the lack
of a kilonova detection. These upper bounds on the ejecta mass can be related
to limits on the maximum mass of the binary neutron star candidate S190425z and
to constraints on the mass-ratio, spin, and NS compactness for the potential

probabilistic input gate. The Bayesian formulation leads naturally to the two

that inference naturally depends upon future inputs as well as past ones.
Experiments on speech recognition confirm that the resulting architecture can
perform as well as a bidirectional recurrent network with the same number of
parameters as a unidirectional one. Further, when configured explicitly
bidirectionally, the architecture can exceed the performance of a conventional

the central source, their abundances and total column density, and the
mechanism responsible for their observed absorption variability.
  Methods. We studied the UV spectra acquired during the campaign as well as
from three previous epochs (2002-2010). Our main analysis tools are ionic
column-density extraction techniques and photoionization models (both
equilibrium and time-dependent models) based on the code Cloudy.
  Results. For component 1 (at -600 km/s) our findings include the following:
metallicity that is roughly twice solar; a simple model based on a fixed total
column-density absorber, reacting to changes in ionizing illumination that
matches the different ionic column densities derived from four spectroscopic
epochs spanning 13 years; and a distance of R=6+2.5-1.5 pc from the central
source. Component 2 (at -1430 km/s) has shallow troughs and is at a much larger
R. For component 3 (at -1880 km/s) our findings include: a similar metallicity
to component 1; a photoionization-based model can explain the major features of
its complicated absorption trough variability and an upper limit of 60 or 150
pc on R. This upper limit is consistent and complementary to the X-ray derived
lower limit of 12 or 31 pc for R. The total column density of the UV phase is
roughly 1% and 0.1% of the lower and upper ionization components of the warm
absorber, respectively.
  Conclusions. The NGC 7469 outflow shows super-solar metallicity similar to
the outflow in Mrk 279, carbon and nitrogen are twice and four times more
abundant than their solar values, respectively. Similar to the NGC 5548 case, a
simple model can explain the physical characteristics and the variability
observed in the outflow.

eliminates the need to synthesise ad hoc wires of any type: functional and
infrastructural. SiLago blocks are organised into region instances. In a region
instance, communication among SiLago blocks is synchronous and happens over a
regional network on chip (NoC), whose fragments are also absorbed into SiLago
blocks. Consequently, the regional NoCs get created by the abutment of SiLago
blocks. The clock tree used in a region is called regional clock tree (RCT).

real-life applications like human-computer interaction (HCI). Therefore, in
this paper, we study pre-training in deep RL to reduce the training time and
improve the performance in speech recognition, a popular application of HCI. We
achieve significantly improved performance in less time on a publicly available
speech command recognition dataset.

Bayesian statistical framework, not only can we infer the halo mass and
concentration efficiently, but also treat various observational effects,
including the selection function, incomplete data, and measurement errors, in a
rigorous and straightforward manner. Through tests with mock samples, we show
that our method is valid and accurate, and more precise than pure steady-state
methods. It can constrain the halo mass to within ~ 20% using only 20 tracers
and has a small intrinsic uncertainty of ~ 10%. In addition to the clear
application to the Milky Way and similar galaxies, our method can be extended
to galaxy groups or clusters.

longitudinal curves. In the proposed method, clusters of mean functions are
identified through a weighted concave pairwise fusion method. The EM algorithm
and the alternating direction method of multiplier algorithm are combined to
estimate the group structure, mean functions and the principal components
simultaneously. The proposed method also allows to incorporate the prior
neighborhood information to have more meaningful groups by adding pairwise
weights in the pairwise penalties. In the simulation study, the performance of
the proposed method is compared to some existing clustering methods in terms of
the accuracy for estimating the number of subgroups and mean functions. The
results suggest that ignoring covariance structure will have a great effect on
the performance of estimating the number of groups and estimating accuracy. The
effect of including pairwise weights is also explored in a spatial lattice
setting to take consideration of the spatial information. The results show that
incorporating spatial weights will improve the performance. A real example is

read noise and photon shot noise, these cameras are typically handheld, have
small apertures and sensors, use mass-produced analog electronics that cannot
easily be cooled, and are commonly used to photograph subjects that move, like
children and pets. In this paper we describe a system for capturing clean,
sharp, colorful photographs in light as low as 0.3~lux, where human vision
becomes monochromatic and indistinct. To permit handheld photography without
flash illumination, we capture, align, and combine multiple frames. Our system
employs ""motion metering"", which uses an estimate of motion magnitudes (whether
due to handshake or moving objects) to identify the number of frames and the
per-frame exposure times that together minimize both noise and motion blur in a
captured burst. We combine these frames using robust alignment and merging
techniques that are specialized for high-noise imagery. To ensure accurate
colors in such low light, we employ a learning-based auto white balancing
algorithm. To prevent the photographs from looking like they were shot in
daylight, we use tone mapping techniques inspired by illusionistic painting:
increasing contrast, crushing shadows to black, and surrounding the scene with
darkness. All of these processes are performed using the limited computational
resources of a mobile device. Our system can be used by novice photographers to
produce shareable pictures in a few seconds based on a single shutter press,
even in environments so dim that humans cannot see clearly.

scarce when contributions are provided voluntarily. Failure to cooperate in the
provision or preservation of these goods is fundamental to sustainability
challenges, ranging from local fisheries to global climate change. In the real
world, such cooperative dilemmas occur in multiple interactions with complex
strategic interests and frequently without full information. We argue that
voluntary cooperation enabled across multiple coalitions (akin to
polycentricity) not only facilitates greater generation of non-excludable
public goods, but may also allow evolution toward a more cooperative, stable,
and inclusive approach to governance. Contrary to any previous study, we show
that these merits of multi-coalition governance are far more general than the
singular examples occurring in the literature, and are robust under diverse
conditions of excludability, congestability of the non-excludable public good,
and arbitrary shapes of the return-to-contribution function. We first confirm
the intuition that a single coalition without enforcement and with players
pursuing their self-interest without knowledge of returns to contribution is
prone to cooperative failure. Next, we demonstrate that the same pessimistic
model but with a multi-coalition structure of governance experiences relatively
higher cooperation by enabling recognition of marginal gains of cooperation in
the game at stake. In the absence of enforcement, public-goods regimes that
evolve through a proliferation of voluntary cooperative forums can maintain and
increase cooperation more successfully than singular, inclusive regimes.

study, for the first time, neutrino-nucleon interactions (including the tau
flavour) in the 0.5-1 TeV neutrino energy range. The detector will be installed
in the decommissioned TI18 tunnel and uses nuclear emulsions. Its simplicity
allows construction and installation before the LHC Run 3, 2021-2023; with
150/fb in Run3, the experiment can record up to two thousand neutrino
interactions, and up to a hundred tau neutrino events. The XSEN detector
intercepts the intense neutrino flux, generated by the LHC beams colliding in
IP1, at large pseudo-rapidities, where neutrino energies can exceed the TeV.
Since the neutrino-N interaction cross section grows almost linearly with
energy, the detector can be light and still collect a considerable sample of
neutrino interactions. In our proposal, the detector weighs less than 3 tons.
It is lying slightly above the ideal prolongation of the LHC beam from the
straight section; this configuration, off the beam axis, although very close to
it, enhances the contribution of neutrinos from c and b decays, and
consequently of tau neutrinos. The detector fits in the TI18 tunnel without
modifications. We plan for a demonstrator experiment in 2021 with a small
detector of about 0.5 tons; with 25/fb, nearly a hundred interactions of
neutrinos of about 1 TeV can be recorded. The aim of this pilot run is a good
in-situ characterisation of the machine-generated backgrounds, an experimental
verification of the systematic uncertainties and efficiencies, and a tuning of
the emulsion analysis infrastructure and efficiency. This Letter provides an

physical gauge degree of freedom in non-Abelian gauge theory by imposing the
covariant gauge constraint. Unfortunately, the solution of the gauge constraint
is not unique, thus the redundant gauge degree of freedom, called Gribov
copies, remains unfixed. One of the traditional methods to partially resolve
the Gribov problem is to restrict the space of gauge orbits inside the bounded
region known as the Gribov region. The meaning of partially resolve is that
this procedure can solve only the positivity's problem of the Faddeev-Popov
operator but the Gribov copies are still there. However, on the bright side,
the restriction to the Gribov region leads to the modification of the gluon
propagator. Additionally, the new form of the gluon propagator yields the
violation of the reflection positivity which is considered as the important
axiom of the Euclidean quantum field theory. This shows that the gluon field in
the Gribov region is an unphysical particle or technically confined. In this
review article, we will start by discussing the traditional Faddeev-Popov
method and its consequence on the proof of the unitarity of the perturbative
Yang-Mills theory. Next, we will discuss the blind spot of the Faddeev-Popov
quantization and study the mathematical and physical origin of the Gribov

that, we demonstrate the modification of the gluon field after restricting
inside the bounded Gribov region. Finally, we show that the new form of the
gluon leads to the violation of the reflection positivity axiom.

this question in the context of self-supervised goal-conditioned reinforcement
learning. A central challenge in this learning regime is the problem of goal
setting: in order to practice useful skills, the robot must be able to
autonomously set goals that are feasible but diverse. When the robot's
environment and available objects vary, as they do in most open-world settings,
the robot must propose to itself only those goals that it can accomplish in its

self-supervised goal-conditioned RL in a single-environment setting, where goal
proposals come from the robot's past experience or a generative model are
sufficient. In more diverse settings, this frequently leads to impossible goals
and, as we show experimentally, prevents effective learning. We propose a
conditional goal-setting model that aims to propose goals that are feasible
from the robot's current state. We demonstrate that this enables
self-supervised goal-conditioned off-policy learning with raw image
observations in the real world, enabling a robot to manipulate a variety of

recent years especially in areas of fine-grained object recognition, retrieval,

unseen classes via auxiliary semantic prototypes (e.g., word or attribute
vectors). However, the popularly learned projection functions in previous works
cannot generalize well due to non-visual components included in semantic
prototypes. Besides, the incompleteness of provided prototypes and captured

this paper, we propose a hierarchical prototype learning formulation to provide
a systematical solution (named HPL) for zero-shot recognition. Specifically,
HPL is able to obtain discriminability on both seen and unseen class domains by
learning visual prototypes respectively under the transductive setting. To
narrow the gap of two domains, we further learn the interpretable
super-prototypes in both visual and semantic spaces. Meanwhile, the two spaces
are further bridged by maximizing their structural consistency. This not only
facilitates the representativeness of visual prototypes, but also alleviates
the loss of information of semantic prototypes. An extensive group of
experiments are then carefully designed and presented, demonstrating that HPL
obtains remarkably more favorable efficiency and effectiveness, over currently

in large-scale environment. Autonomous robots operating in real world complex
scenarios require planning in the discrete (task) space and the continuous

reason at the highest-level, for example the regions to navigate to; on the
other hand, the feasibility of the respective navigation tasks have to be
checked at the execution level. This presents a need for motion-planning-aware
task planners. We discuss a probabilistically complete approach that leverages
this task-motion interaction for navigating in indoor domains, returning a plan
that is optimal at the task-level. Furthermore, our framework is intended for
motion planning under motion and sensing uncertainty, which is formally known
as belief space planning. The underlying methodology is validated with a
simulated office environment in Gazebo. In addition, we discuss the limitations
and provide suggestions for improvements and future work.

birth of quantum mechanics to state-of-the-art quantum technologies. Two
complementary measurement schemes have been widely investigated in a variety of
quantum systems: von Neumann's projective 'strong' measurement and Aharonov's
weak measurement. Here, we report the observation of a weak-to-strong
measurement transition in a single trapped $40Ca^+$ ion system. The transition
is realized by tuning the interaction strength between the ion's internal
electronic state and its vibrational motion, which play the roles of the
measured system and the measuring pointer, respectively. By pre- and
post-selecting the internal state, a pointer state composed of two of the ion's
motional wavepackets is obtained, and its central-position shift, which
corresponds to the measurement outcome, demonstrates the transition from the
weak-value asymptotes to the expected-value asymptotes. Quantitatively, the
weak-to-strong measurement transition is characterized by a universal
transition factor $e^{-\Gamma^2}$, where $\Gamma$ is a dimensionless parameter
related to the system-apparatus coupling. This transition, which continuously
connects weak measurements and strong measurements, may open new experimental
possibilities to test quantum foundations and prompt us to re-examine and
improve the measurement schemes of related quantum technologies.

generic light-matter interactions and show that any classical
electron-laser-beam interaction can be represented as an outcome of a weak
measurement. In particular, the appearance of classical point-particle
acceleration is an example of an amplified weak value resulting from weak
measurement. A universal factor quantifies the measurement regimes and their
transition from quantum to classical, where Gamma corresponds to the ratio
between the electron wavepacket size and the optical wavelength. This
measurement-based formulation is experimentally verified in both limits of
photon-induced near-field electron microscopy and the classical acceleration

operation among pedestrians. This work proposes using deep reinforcement (RL)
learning as a framework to model the complex interactions and cooperation with
nearby, decision-making agents, such as pedestrians and other robots. Existing
RL-based works assume homogeneity of agent properties, use specific motion
models over short timescales, or lack a principled method to handle a large,
possibly varying number of agents. Therefore, this work develops an algorithm
that learns collision avoidance among a variety of heterogeneous,
non-communicating, dynamic agents without assuming they follow any particular
behavior rules. It extends our previous work by introducing a strategy using
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) that enables the algorithm to use observations of
an arbitrary number of other agents, instead of a small, fixed number of
neighbors. The proposed algorithm is shown to outperform a classical collision
avoidance algorithm, another deep RL-based algorithm, and scales with the
number of agents better (fewer collisions, shorter time to goal) than our
previously published learning-based approach. Analysis of the LSTM provides
insights into how observations of nearby agents affect the hidden state and
quantifies the performance impact of various agent ordering heuristics. The
learned policy generalizes to several applications beyond the training
scenarios: formation control (arrangement into letters), demonstrations on a
fleet of four multirotors and on a fully autonomous robotic vehicle capable of
traveling at human walking speed among pedestrians.

Bayesian revealed preferences to test for rationality: does there exist a

constraints stemming from rational inattention to characterize the attention

there is a separate field-effect besides other effects (e.g., from numbers of

applied inverse-probability of treatment weighting (IPW). Using Web of Science

among subject categories in citation rates still remain, even if the subject
categories are made comparable in the field-related attributes (e.g.,
comparable of co-authors, comparable number of pages) by IPW. In a diagnostic
step of our statistical analyses, we considered propensity scores as covariates

calculated mean value differences of the fields after IPW representing the

  concept for lab-on-a-chip platforms","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1906.11773",,,,"physics.optics physics.app-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ever-growing field of microfluidics requires precise and flexible control
over fluid flow at the micro- and nanoscales. Current constraints demand a
variety of controllable components for performing different operations inside
closed microchambers and microreactors. In this context, novel nanophotonic
approaches can significantly enhance existing capabilities and provide new
functionalities via finely tuned light-matter interaction mechanisms. Here we
propose a novel design, featuring a dual functionality on-chip: boosted
optically-driven particle diffusion and nanoparticle sorting. Our methodology
is based on a specially designed high-index dielectric nanoantenna, which
strongly enhances spin-orbit angular momentum transfer from an incident laser
beam to the scattered field. As a result, exceptionally compact, subwavelength
optical nanovortices are formed and drive spiral motion of peculiar plasmonic
nanoparticles via the efficient interplay between curled spin optical forces
and radiation pressure. The nanovortex size is an order of magnitude smaller
than that provided by conventional beam-based approaches. The nanoparticles
mediate nano-confined fluid motion enabling nanomixing without a need of moving
bulk elements inside a microchamber. Moreover, precise sorting of gold
nanoparticles, demanded for on-chip separation and filtering, can be achieved
by exploiting the non-trivial dependence of the curled optical forces on the
nanoobject size. Altogether, this study introduces a versatile platform for
further miniaturization of moving-part-free, optically driven microfluidic
chips for fast chemical synthesis and analysis, preparation of emulsions, or
generation of chemical gradients with light-controlled navigation of
nanoparticles, viruses or biomolecules.

updates to a monitor with exponential service time and first-come-first-served
(FCFS) discipline. We investigate the freshness of the received updates and
propose a new metric termed as \textit{Age upon Decisions (AuD)}, which is
defined as the time elapsed from the generation of each update to the epoch it
is used to make decisions (e.g., estimations, inferences, controls). Within
this framework, we aim at improving the freshness of updates at decision epochs
by scheduling the update arrival process and the decision making process.
Theoretical results show that 1) when the decisions are made according to a
Poisson process, the average AuD is independent of decision rate and would be
minimized if the arrival process is periodic (i.e., deterministic); 2) when
both the decision process and the arrive process are periodic, the average AuD
is larger than, but decreases with decision rate to, the average AuD of the
corresponding system with Poisson decisions (i.e., random); 3) when both the
decision process and the arrive process are periodic, the average AuD can be
further decreased by optimally controlling the offset between the two
processes. For practical IoT systems, therefore, it is suggested to employ
periodic arrival processes and random decision processes. Nevertheless, making
periodical updates and decisions with properly controlled offset also is a
promising solution if the timing information of the two processes can be
accessed by the monitor.

different areas of physics. A possible application is in Positron Emission
Tomography, where annihilation quanta with orthogonal polarizations are
emitted. Since polarization can be measured via Compton scattering, the initial
orthogonality of polarizations can be translated to correlation of azimuthal
scattering angles, and this correlation may be exploited as an additional
handle to identify the true coincidence events. To examine the concept of using
the polarization correlations in PET, we have used a system of two compact,
position and energy-sensitive Compton detectors in coincidence mode. Each
consists of a single matrix of scintillation pixels, read-out by an array of
Silicon photomultipliers. The Compton events in each module are clearly
identified and the scattering angles are reconstructed from the energy
deposition and event topology. We have extracted the polarimetric modulation
factors from the distributions of the difference of the azimuthal angles of the
two Compton-scattered gammas and studied their dependence on Compton scattering
angles $\theta$ and on azimuthal resolution $\Delta\phi$. For scattering angles
around $\theta_{1,2}=82^\circ$, where the maximum modulation is expected, the
modulation factors from $\mu=0.15\pm 0.01$ to $\mu=0.27\pm 0.02$ have been
measured, depending on the azimuthal resolution, which is governed by event
topology in the detectors. Analogously, for scattering around
$\theta_{1,2}=70^\circ$, modulation factors from $\mu=0.12\pm 0.01$ to
$\mu=0.21\pm 0.02$ have been obtained. The results show that the measurement of
the polarization correlations of annihilation quanta are feasible with compact
single-layer, single-side read-out detectors, which may be used to build
cost-efficient systems for various applications where gamma-ray polarization
information is of interest.

and thus that high classification accuracy can be achieved even when weights
and activations are quantized down to binary values. Network binarization on
FPGAs greatly increases area efficiency by replacing resource-hungry
multipliers with lightweight XNOR gates. However, an FPGA's fundamental
building block, the K-LUT, is capable of implementing far more than an XNOR: it
can perform any K-input Boolean operation. Inspired by this observation, we
propose LUTNet, an end-to-end hardware-software framework for the construction
of area-efficient FPGA-based neural network accelerators using the native LUTs
as inference operators. We describe the realization of both unrolled and tiled
LUTNet architectures, with the latter facilitating smaller, less power-hungry
deployment over the former while sacrificing area and energy efficiency along
with throughput. For both varieties, we demonstrate that the exploitation of
LUT flexibility allows for far heavier pruning than possible in prior works,
resulting in significant area savings while achieving comparable accuracy.
Against the state-of-the-art binarized neural network implementation, we
achieve up to twice the area efficiency for several standard network models
when inferencing popular datasets. We also demonstrate that even greater energy
efficiency improvements are obtainable.

The present analysis reveals that the inter-vortex distances in any non-fixed

lattice materials where each strut can be made of one of a set of available
materials. We design the lattices to extremize effective properties. As
customary in topology optimization, we design a periodic unit cell of the
lattice and obtain the effective properties via numerical homogenization. Each
bar is represented as a cylindrical offset surface of a medial axis
parameterized by the positions of the endpoints of the medial axis. These
parameters are smoothly mapped onto a continuous density field for the primal
and sensitivity analysis via the geometry projection method. A size variable
per material is ascribed to each bar and penalized as in density-based topology
optimization to facilitate the entire removal of bars from the design. During
the optimization, we allow bars to be made of a mixture of the available
materials. However, to ensure each bar is either exclusively made of one
material or removed altogether from the optimal design, we impose optimization
constraints that ensure each size variable is 0 or 1, and that at most one
material size variable is 1. The proposed material interpolation scheme readily
accommodates any number of materials. To obtain lattices with desired material
symmetries, we design only a reference region of the unit cell and reflect its
geometry projection with respect to the appropriate planes of symmetry. Also,
to ensure bars remain whole upon reflection inside the unit cell or with
respect to the periodic boundaries, we impose a no-cut constraint on the bars.
We demonstrate the efficacy of our method via numerical examples of bulk and
shear moduli maximization and Poisson's ratio minimization for two- and
three-material lattices with cubic symmetry.

and the failure mode of structures but does not provide any information on the
displacement capacity, which is one of the concepts which most affects the
seismic safety. Therefore, since many researchers did not consider limit
analysis as a possible tool for the seismic assessment of structures, its
widespread employment has been prevented. In this paper this common belief is
questioned and the authors show that limit analysis can be useful in the
evaluation of the seismic performance of frame structures. In particular, to
overcome the limitation on the possibility to evaluate the displacements of a
structure based on a limit analysis approach, an approximated capacity curve is
reconstructed. The latter is based on a limit analysis strategy, which takes
into account the second order effects, and evaluates the displacement capacity
considering a post-peak softening branch and a threshold on the allowed plastic
rotations. Then, based on this simplified capacity curve, an equivalent single
degree of freedom system is defined in order to assess the seismic performance
of frame structures. The proposed simplified strategy is implemented in a
dedicated software and the obtained results are validated with well-established
approaches based on nonlinear static analyses, showing the reliability and the
computational efficiency of this methodology

scientific knowledge into data-driven approaches (e.g., neural networks) in
order to improve the latter's effectiveness. In this study, the Theory-guided
Neural Network (TgNN) is proposed for deep learning of subsurface flow. In the
TgNN, as supervised learning, the neural network is trained with available
observations or simulation data while being simultaneously guided by theory
(e.g., governing equations, other physical constraints, engineering controls,
and expert knowledge) of the underlying problem. The TgNN can achieve higher
accuracy than the ordinary Artificial Neural Network (ANN) because the former
provides physically feasible predictions and can be more readily generalized
beyond the regimes covered with the training data. Furthermore, the TgNN model
is proposed for subsurface flow with heterogeneous model parameters. Several
numerical cases of two-dimensional transient saturated flow are introduced to
test the performance of the TgNN. In the learning process, the loss function
contains data mismatch, as well as PDE constraint, engineering control, and
expert knowledge. After obtaining the parameters of the neural network by
minimizing the loss function, a TgNN model is built that not only fits the
data, but also adheres to physical/engineering constraints. Predicting the
future response can be easily realized by the TgNN model. In addition, the TgNN
model is tested in more complicated scenarios, such as prediction with changed
boundary conditions, learning from noisy data or outliers, transfer learning,
and engineering controls. Numerical results demonstrate that the TgNN model
achieves much better predictability, reliability, and generalizability than ANN
models due to the physical/engineering constraints in the former.

complex dynamics where different mechanisms coexist and compete eventually
leading to plasma mixing. In this work, we present fully kinetic
Particle-In-Cell simulations of different boundary layers characterized by the
following main ingredients: a velocity shear, a density gradient and a magnetic
gradient localized at the same position. In particular, the presence of a
density gradient drives the development of the lower hybrid drift instability
(LHDI), which competes with the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) in the
development of the boundary layer. Depending on the density gradient, the LHDI
can even dominate the dynamics of the layer. Because these two instabilities
grow on different spatial and temporal scales, when the LHDI develops faster
than the KHI an inverse cascade is generated, at least in 2D. This inverse
cascade, starting at the LHDI kinetic scales, generates structures at scale
lengths at which the KHI would typically develop. When that is the case, those
structures can suppress the KHI itself because they significantly affect the
underlying velocity shear gradient. We conclude that depending on the density
gradient, the velocity jump and the width of the boundary layer, the LHDI in
its nonlinear phase can become the primary instability for plasma mixing. These
numerical simulations show that the LHDI is likely to be a dominant process at
the magnetopause of Mercury. These results are expected to be of direct impact
to the interpretation of the forthcoming BepiColombo observations.

`Disgust', `Fear', `Happiness', `Sadness', `Surprise' and `Neutral'. The
`Emotion Recognition in the Wild' (EmotiW) competition is now in its 7th year

of this paper is the EmotiW sub-challenge of classifying videos in the `Acted
Facial Expression in the Wild' (AFEW) dataset, consisting of both visual and
audio modalities, into one of the above classes. Machine learning has exploded
as a research topic in recent years, with advancements in `Deep Learning' a key

(i) to apply the latest `state-of-the-art' visual and temporal networks and
(ii) exploring various methods of fusing features extracted from the visual and
audio elements to enrich the information available to the final model making
the prediction. There are a number of complex issues that arise when trying to
classify emotions for `in-the-wild' video sequences, which the above two
approaches attempt to directly address. There are some positive findings when
comparing the results of this paper to past submissions, indicating that
further research into the proposed methods and fine-tuning of the models

focuses on the laboratory environment. However, it faces many challenges in

partial or full occlusions. Those challenges lead to different face areas with
different degrees of sharpness and completeness. Inspired by this fact, we
focus on the authenticity of predictions generated by different <emotion,
region> pairs. For example, if only the mouth areas are available and the
emotion classifier predicts happiness, then there is a question of how to judge
the authenticity of predictions. This problem can be converted into the
contribution of different face areas to different emotions. In this paper, we
divide the whole face into six areas: nose areas, mouth areas, eyes areas, nose
to mouth areas, nose to eyes areas and mouth to eyes areas. To obtain more
convincing results, our experiments are conducted on three different databases:
facial expression recognition + ( FER+), real-world affective faces database
(RAF-DB) and expression in-the-wild (ExpW) dataset. Through analysis of the
classification accuracy, the confusion matrix and the class activation map
(CAM), we can establish convincing results. To sum up, the contributions of
this paper lie in two areas: 1) We visualize concerned areas of human faces in
emotion recognition; 2) We analyze the contribution of different face areas to
different emotions in real-world conditions through experimental analysis. Our
findings can be combined with findings in psychology to promote the

restricted to those observed directly in randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
However, for regulatory and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) decision-making
a longer time horizon is often required than is studied in RCTs. Therefore,
extrapolation is required to estimate long-term treatment effect. Registry data
can provide evidence to support extrapolation of treatment effects from RCTs,
which are considered the main sources of evidence of effect for new drug
applications. A number of methods are available to extrapolate survival data,
such as Exponential, Weibull, Gompertz, log-logistic or log-normal parametric
models. The different methods have varying functional forms and can result in
different survival estimates.
  Methods: The aim of this paper was to use registry data to supplement the
relatively short term RCT data to obtain long term estimates of effect. No
formal hypotheses were tested. We explore the above parametric regression
models as well as a nonparametric regression model based on local linear
(parametric) regression. We also explore a Bayesian model constrained to the
long term estimate of survival reported in literature, a Bayesian power prior
approach on the variability observed from published literature, and a Bayesian
Model Averaging (BMA) approach. The methods were applied to extrapolate overall
survival of a RCT in metastatic melanoma.
  Results: The results showed that the BMA approach was able to fit the RCT
data well, with the lowest variability of the area under the curve up to 72
months with or without the SEER Medicare registry.
  Conclusion: the BMA approach is a viable approach to extrapolate overall
