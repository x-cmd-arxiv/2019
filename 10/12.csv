optimization technique for deep neural networks when the true gradients cannot

research that uses surrogate gradients to improve the gradient estimation of
ES. We propose a novel method to optimally incorporate surrogate gradient
information. Our approach, unlike previous work, needs no information about the
quality of the surrogate gradients and is always guaranteed to find a descent
direction that is better than the surrogate gradient. This allows to
iteratively use the previous gradient estimate as surrogate gradient for the
current search point. We theoretically prove that this yields fast convergence
to the true gradient for linear functions and show under simplifying
assumptions that it significantly improves gradient estimates for general
functions. Finally, we evaluate our approach empirically on MNIST and
reinforcement learning tasks and show that it considerably improves the
gradient estimation of ES at no extra computational cost.

models with a small sound speed, $c_s$, to the extent that $c_s \ll 1$ is
obtained by having higher-derivative interactions like $\mathfrak{L}_{\rm eff}

arises more generally for models whose lagrangian is given as a function $P(X)$
for $X = -\partial_\mu \Phi \partial^\mu \Phi$ --- including in particular DBI
models for which $P(X) \propto \sqrt{1-kX}$ --- since these keep all orders in

sensible power-counting scheme for DBI models that gives a controlled expansion

theoretical error for any prediction (such as for inflationary correlation
functions) by fixing the leading power of these small parameters that is
dropped when not computing all graphs (such as by restricting to the classical
approximation); a prerequisite for meaningful comparisons with observations.
The new power-counting regime arises because small $c_s$ alters the kinematics
of free fluctuations in a way that changes how interactions scale at low

augmented hard example mining, which can be easily integrated to a common Re-ID

leverage the pre-trained encoder and discriminator to regularise the training

a scalarised BH. The most studied geometric [matter] source term for such
spontaneous BH scalarisation is the Gauss-Bonnet quadratic curvature [Maxwell
invariant]. This phenomenon has been mostly analysed for asymptotically flat
spacetimes. Here we consider the impact of a positive cosmological constant,
which introduces a cosmological horizon. The cosmological constant does not
change the local conditions on the scalar coupling for a tachyonic instability
of the scalar-free BHs to emerge. But it leaves a significant imprint on the
possible new scalarised BHs. It is shown that no scalarised BH solutions exist,
under a smoothness assumption, if the scalar field is confined between the BH

cosmological horizon, we construct new scalarised BHs. These are asymptotically
de Sitter in the (matter) Einstein-Maxwell-scalar model, with only mild
difference with respect to their asymptotically flat counterparts. But in the

a new and ideal platform to simulate exotic electronic many-body phenomena in
the condensed phase. However, this highly excited non-equilibrium system is
expected to be so short-lived that it has eluded observation so far. Here, we
demonstrate the first step toward its realization by exciting high-lying
electronic (Rydberg) states of the atomic Mott insulator with a coherent
ultrashort laser pulse. Beyond a threshold principal quantum number where
Rydberg orbitals of neighboring lattice sites overlap with each other, the
atoms efficiently undergo spontaneous Penning ionization resulting in a drastic
change of ion-counting statistics, sharp increase of avalanche ionization and
the formation of an ultracold plasma. These observations signal the actual
creation of exotic electronic states with overlapping wave functions, which is
further confirmed by a significant difference in ionization dynamics between a
Bose-Einstein condensate and a Mott insulator.

charged non-relativistic quantum plasma, interacting with its self-generated
electromagnetic potential. One consequence of our analysis is to demonstrate
that the Lorentz force associated with the electromagnetic field is
well-defined for solutions slightly more regular than the finite energy class.
This aspect is of fundamental importance since all the related physical models
require the observability of electromagnetic effects. The well-posedness of the
Lorentz force still seems to be a major open problem in the class of solutions
which are only finite energy. We show the global well-posedness at high
regularity for the cubic and sub-cubic case, and we provide polynomial bounds
for the growth of the Sobolev norm of the solutions, for a certain range of
non-linearities. An important role is played by appropriate a priori dispersive
estimates, obtained by means of Koch-Tzvetkov type bounds for the
non-homogeneous Schr\""odinger equation, which overcome the lack of Strichartz
estimates for the magnetic Schr\""odinger flow. Because of the power-type
non-linearity, the propagation of higher regularity, globally in time, cannot
be achieved via a bootstrap argument as done in [44]. Our approach then
exploits the analysis of a modified energy functional, combined with the a

an aluminum encapsulated poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(methyl

semiconductor substrates. Films patterned via this method maintain low-loss
characteristics down to 25 microns with only a factor of 2 increase down to 5
microns. A rich structure of thickness and radially confined spin-wave modes
reveals the quality of the patterned films. Further fitting, simulation, and
analytic analysis provides an exchange stiffness, $A_{ex} = 2.2 \pm 0.5 \times

the professor, instead of lecturing about diagrams or showing examples of such

the mobile application on their mobiles to practice by designing diagrams

various statistical features such as energy and standard deviation of the

For instance, within Newtonian mechanics, we
seem to have a good grasp on the empirical significance of boosts, by applying
it to subsystems. This is exemplified by the thought experiment known as
Galileo's ship: the inertial state of motion of a ship is immaterial to how
events unfold in the cabin, but is registered in the values of relational
quantities such as the distance and velocity of the ship relative to the shore.
  But the significance of gauge symmetries seems less clear. For example, can
gauge transformations in Yang-Mills theory---taken as mere descriptive
redundancy---exhibit a similar relational empirical significance as the boosts
of Galileo's ship? This question has been debated in the last fifteen years in
philosophy of physics.
  I will argue that the answer is `yes', but only for a finite subset of gauge
transformations, and under special conditions. Under those conditions, we can
mathematically identify empirical significance with a failure of supervenience:
the state of the Universe is not uniquely determined by the intrinsic state of
its isolated subsystems. Empirical significance is therefore encoded in those
relations between subsystems that stand apart from their intrinsic states.

individual-based model to investigate the front dynamics for a region in which
dispersal or growth of individuals is reduced to zero (obstacles) or increased

is determined by a local front speed only, a principle of least time can be
employed to predict front speed and shape. The resulting analytical solutions
motivate an event-based algorithm illustrating the effects of several obstacles

heterogeneous environments by solving the Eikonal equation numerically.
Obstacles lead to a slow-down that is dominated by the number density and width
of obstacles, but not by their precise shape. Hotspots result in a speedup,
which we characterise as function of hotspot strength and density. Our findings
emphasise the importance of taking the dimensionality of the environment into

structure and evolution of the Galactic environment. However, the multiplicity
of WD progenitors is generally neglected. Specifically, a merger in a binary
system can lead to a single WD, which could result in wrongly inferred
quantities if only single stellar evolution (SSE) is considered. These mergers
are linked to transients such as luminous red novae and Type Ia supernovae.
Aims: We investigate the impact of binary evolution (BE) upon observable single
WDs, and compare their properties to WDs formed through SSE. We assess the
evolutionary channels and the age and mass distributions of the resulting
single Wds. Methods: We employed \texttt{SeBa} to model the evolution of single
star and binary populations. We synthesised the observable single WD population
within $100$ pc, including cooling and observational selection effects.
Additionally, we constructed models with different evolution and primordial
population properties to study the effects on the properties of the resulting
single WDs.
  Results: White dwarfs from binary mergers make up about $10-30\%$ of all
observable single WDs and $30-50\%$ of massive WDs. On average, individual WDs
take
  $3.1-5$ times longer to form through BE than SE, and so appear ${\sim} 1$ Gyr
younger than they are if BE is ignored. In all models, the effect of mergers on
the age distribution is clearly noticeable. The median age typically increases
by $85-430$ Myr and $200-390$ Myr for massive WDs. Although abundant, we do not
find evidence that WDs from mergers significantly alter the shape of the WD
mass distribution. Conclusions: Assuming SSE for inferring properties of single
WDs gives rise to intrinsic errors as single WDs can also be formed following a
binary merger. Strategies for mitigating the effect of mergers on the WD age
distributions are discussed.

of most DNN workloads, main memory can dominate the system's energy consumption
and stall time. One effective way to reduce the energy consumption and increase
the performance of DNN inference systems is by using approximate memory, which
operates with reduced supply voltage and reduced access latency parameters that
violate standard specifications. Using approximate memory reduces reliability,

intrinsic capacity to tolerate increased bit errors. This can enable
energy-efficient and high-performance neural network inference using
approximate DRAM devices.

DNN energy consumption and DNN evaluation latency by using approximate DRAM
devices, while strictly meeting a user-specified target DNN accuracy. EDEN
relies on two key ideas: 1) retraining the DNN for a target approximate DRAM
device to increase the DNN's error tolerance, and 2) efficient mapping of the
error tolerance of each individual DNN data type to a corresponding approximate
DRAM partition in a way that meets the user-specified DNN accuracy
requirements.
  We evaluate EDEN on multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and DNN accelerators with error
models obtained from real approximate DRAM devices. For a target accuracy
within 1% of the original DNN, our results show that EDEN enables 1) an average
DRAM energy reduction of 21%, 37%, 31%, and 32% in CPU, GPU, and two DNN
accelerator architectures, respectively, across a variety of DNNs, and 2) an
average (maximum) speedup of 8% (17%) and 2.7% (5.5%) in CPU and GPU
architectures, respectively, when evaluating latency-bound DNNs.

observations that leverage gravitational lensing by intervening masses, which
act as natural cosmic telescopes to magnify background sources. Previous
studies have harnessed this effect to probe the distant universe at
ultraviolet, optical, infrared and millimeter wavelengths. However, strong
lensing studies of young, star-forming galaxies have never extended into X-ray
wavelengths, which uniquely trace high-energy phenomena. Here we report an
X-ray detection of star formation in a highly magnified, strongly lensed
galaxy. This lensed galaxy, seen during the first third of the history of the
Universe, is a low--mass, low--metallicity starburst with elevated X-ray
emission, and is a likely analog to the first generation of galaxies. Our
measurements yield insight into the role that X-ray emission from stellar
populations in the first generation of galaxies may play in re-ionizing the
Universe. This observation paves the way for future strong lensing-assisted
X-ray studies of distant galaxies reaching orders of magnitude below the
detection limits of current deep fields, and previews the depths that will be

results to include the effects of radiative cooling and heating from a UV
background, using analytic models and high resolution idealized simulations. We
currently do not consider self-shielding, thermal conduction or gravity. A key
parameter in determining the fate of the streams is the ratio of the cooling
time in the turbulent mixing layer which forms between the stream and the
background following the onset of the instability, $t_{\rm cool,mix}$, to the
time in which the mixing layer expands to the width of the stream in the
non-radiative case, $t_{\rm shear}$. This can be converted into a critical
stream radius, $R_{\rm s,crit}$, such that $R_{\rm s}/R_{\rm s,crit}=t_{\rm
shear}/t_{\rm cool,mix}$. If $R_{\rm s}<R_{\rm s,crit}$, the non-linear
evolution proceeds similarly to the non-radiative case studied by Mandelker et
al. 2019a. If $R_{\rm s}>R_{\rm s,crit}$, which we find to almost always be the
case for astrophysical cold streams, the stream is not disrupted by KHI.
Rather, background mass cools and condenses onto the stream, and can increase
the mass of cold gas by a factor of $\sim 3$ within 10 stream sound crossing
times. The mass entrainment induces thermal energy losses from the background
and kinetic energy losses from the stream, which we model analytically. Roughly
half of the dissipated energy is radiated away from gas with $T<5\times
10^4{\rm K}$, suggesting much of it will be emitted in Ly$\alpha$.

combination of stellar mass surface density and mass-to-light ratio ($M/L$),
such that low surface brightness is strongly correlated with both galaxy
angular momentum (low surface density) and low specific star formation rate
(high $M/L$). This drives most of the other observed correlations between
surface brightness and galaxy properties, such as the fact that most LSBGs have
low metallicity. We find that LSBGs are more isolated than high surface

trend is driven entirely by the fact that LSBGs are unlikely to be close-in
satellites. The majority of LSBGs are consistent with a formation scenario in
which the galaxies with the highest angular momentum are those that formed most
of their stars recently from a gas reservoir co-rotating with a high-spin dark
matter halo. However, the most extended LSBG disks in EAGLE, which are
comparable in size to observed giant LSBGs, are built up via mergers. These

  Post-Runaway","Accepted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stz2901",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Giant planets are thought to form by runaway gas accretion onto solid cores.
Growth must eventually stop running away, ostensibly because planets open gaps
(annular cavities) in their surrounding discs. Typical models stop runaway by
artificially capping the accretion rate and lowering it to zero over an
arbitrarily short time-scale. In reality, post-runaway accretion persists as
long as the disc remains. During this final and possibly longest phase of
formation, when the planet is still emerging from the disc, its mass can more
than double, and its radius contracts by orders of magnitude. By drawing from
the theory of how gaps clear, we find that post-runaway accretion luminosities
diverge depending on disc viscosity: luminosities fall in low-viscosity discs
but continue to rise past runaway in high-viscosity discs. This divergence
amounts to a factor of $10^2$ by the time the disc disperses. Irrespective of
the specifics of how planets interact with discs, the observed luminosity and
age of an accreting planet can be used to calculate its instantaneous mass,
radius, and accretion rate. We perform this exercise for the planet candidates
embedded within the discs orbiting PDS 70, HD 163296, and MWC 758, inferring
masses of $1-10\, M_{\rm J}$, accretion rates of $0.1-10\, M_{\rm J}$/Myr, and
radii of $1-10\, R_{\rm J}$. Our radii are computed self-consistently from the
planet's concurrent contraction and accretion and do not necessarily equal the
value of $2R_{\rm J}$ commonly assumed; in particular, the radius depends on
the envelope opacity as $R \propto \kappa^{0.5}$.

Hilbert space of these CFTs does not factorize into tensor products, even the
entanglement entropy associated to a spatial subregion cannot be defined as the
von Neumann entropy of a reduced density matrix. While earlier works considered
embedding the density matrix into a larger, factorizing Hilbert space, we apply

propose to couple the target system to a conjugate system, so as to prepare a
symmetry protected topological phase in an extended system by intermittently
breaking the protecting symmetry. Finally, the decoupled conjugate system is
discarded, thus projecting onto the desired topological state in the target
system. By construction, this protocol may be immediately generalized to the
class of invertible topological phases, characterized by the existence of an
inverse topological order. We illustrate our findings with microscopic

(the ""Needle Galaxy""), observed as part of the Dragonfly Edge-on Galaxies
Survey. Our imaging traces starlight over scales of ~100 kpc to surface
brightnesses of ~32 mag/arcsec^2 in azimuthally averaged radial profiles. In
narrow slice profiles along the major axis (with bin sizes ranging from 1.7 x
0.5 kpc to 1.7 x 7.8 kpc), we achieve a depth of ~29-30 mag/arcsec^2. We
confirm the previously observed asymmetric disc truncation. In addition, the
sharp northwest truncation turns over to a shallower component that coincides
with a fan-like feature seen to wrap around the northwest disc limb. We propose
that the fan may be a tidal ribbon, and qualitatively replicate the fan with
simple simulations. Alternative explanations of the fan and the disc's
asymmetry are considered as well. We conclude that we are most likely seeing
evidence for accretion-based outer disk growth in NGC 4565.

Taking this quote in all possible senses, this paper considers Derrida's
definition of limit as gramme, trace, and aporia, and develops the
mathematization of all three. I will consider the structure of mathematical
limit in Fregean arithmetics, calculus, and topology. I argue that a
topological approach to the concept of gramme creates a new ""limit"" that
illustrates the map of our ""commute"" to the unknown, and therefore avoids the
aporetic act of crossing the impassible limit between life and death. This new
""limit,"" often referred to by mathematicians as a ""cone,"" is a shapeless shape
that offers us knowledge about time and space that we otherwise cannot know
about. By redefining the limit of time through three mathematical systems --
arithmetic, calculus, and topology -- this paper offers new perspectives to
couple mathematics with philosophy.

Magellan+MIKE high-resolution spectra of the 28 brightest stars in PW 1 and
used The Cannon to determine their stellar parameters. We find that the mean
metallicity of PW 1 is [Fe/H]=-1.23 with a small scatter of 0.06 dex and the
mean radial velocity is Vhelio=276.7 km/s with a dispersion of 11.0 km/s. Our
results are consistent in Teff, logg, and [Fe/H] with the young and metal-poor
characteristics (116 Myr and [Fe/H]=-1.1) determined for PW 1 from our
discovery paper. We find a strong correlation between the spatial pattern of
the PW 1 stars and the LA II gas with an offset of -10.15 deg in L_MS and +1.55
deg in B_MS. The similarity in metallicity, velocity, and spatial patterns
indicates that PW 1 likely originated in LA II. We find that the spatial and
kinematic separation between LA II and PW 1 can be explained by ram pressure
from Milky Way gas. Using orbit integrations that account for the LMC and MW
halo and outer disk gas, we constrain the halo gas density at the orbital
pericenter of PW 1 to be n_halo (17 kpc) = 2.7 (3) x 10^-3 atoms/cm^3 and the
disk gas density at the midplane at 20 kpc to be n_disk (20 kpc,0) = 6.0 (1.8)

and consists of coarse-grained beads put together on a modular platform to give
generic molecular lipids with tunable properties. The interaction between
coarse-grained beads is governed by soft, short-ranged potentials that account
for the renormalized hydrophobic effect in implicit solvent. The model
faithfully forms micelles, tubular micelles, or bilayers (periodically
infinite, bicelles, or vesicles) depending on the packing ratio of the lipid
molecules. Importantly, for the self-assembled bilayer membranes it is
straightforward to realize gel and fluid phases, the latter of which is most
often of primary interest. We show that the emerging physics over a wide range

sloshing of the ICM could be responsible for this separation. Furthermore, we
detect a second, 4 kpc offset between the peak of the Halpha emission and that
of the X-ray emission. Optical images highlight the presence of a dust filament
extending up to 6 kpc in the cluster BCG, and allow us to estimate a dust mass
within the central 7 kpc of 1.7e+5 Msun. Exploiting the dust to gas ratio and
the L_Halpha-M_mol relation, we argue that a significant amount (up to 10^9
Msun) of molecular gas should be present in the BCG of this cluster. We also
investigate the presence of ICM depressions, finding two putative systems of
cavities; the inner pair is characterized by t age = 18 Myr and P cav = 1.2e+43
erg/s, the outer one by t age = 53 Myr and P cav = 5.6e+42 erg/s. Their age
difference appears to be consistent with the free-fall time of the central
cooling gas and with the offset timescale estimated with the Halpha kinematic
data, suggesting that sloshing is likely playing a key role in this
environment. Furthermore, the cavities' power analysis shows that the AGN
energy injection is able to sustain the feedback cycle, despite cooling being
offset from the BCG nucleus.

normalized and continuous rank of an observation $x$, has wide applications in
fitting real-world data from social science to biological phenomena. The
underlying probability density function (pdf) $f_X(x)$ does not usually have a
closed expression except for specific parameter values. We show however that it
is approximately a unimodal skewed and asymmetric two-sided power law/double
Pareto/log-Laplacian distribution. The BRF pdf has simple properties when the
independent variable is log-transformed: $f_{Z=\log(X)}(z)$ . At the peak it
makes a smooth turn and it does not diverge, lacking the sharp angle observed
in the double Pareto or Laplace distribution. The peak position of $f_Z(z)$ is
$z_0=\log A+(a-b)\log(\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b})-(a\log(a)-b\log(b))/2 $; the
probability is partitioned by the peak to the proportion of
$\sqrt{b}/(\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b})$ (left) and $\sqrt{a}/(\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b})$
(right); the functional form near the peak is controlled by the cubic term in
the Taylor expansion when $a\ne b$; the mean of $Z$ is $E[Z]=\log A+a-b$; the
decay on left and right sides of the peak is approximately exponential with
forms $e^{\frac{z-\log A}{b} }/b$ and $e^{ -\frac{z-\log A}{a}}/a$. These
results are confirmed by numerical simulations. Properties of $f_X(x)$ without
log-transforming the variable are much more complex, though the approximate
double Pareto behavior, $(x/A)^{1/b}/(bx)$ (for $x<A$) and $(x/A)^{-1/a}/(ax)$
(for $x > A$) is simple. Our results elucidate the relationship between BRF and
log-normal distributions when $a=b$ and explain why the BRF is ubiquitous and
versatile. Based on the pdf, we suggest a quick way to elucidate if a real data
set follows a one-sided power-law, a log-normal, a two-sided power-law or a
BRF. We illustrate our results with two examples: urban populations and
financial returns.

  Minimization","8th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2020)",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reinforcement learning encounters major challenges in multi-agent settings,
such as scalability and non-stationarity. Recently, value function
factorization learning emerges as a promising way to address these challenges
in collaborative multi-agent systems. However, existing methods have been
focusing on learning fully decentralized value functions, which are not
efficient for tasks requiring communication. To address this limitation, this
paper presents a novel framework for learning nearly decomposable Q-functions
(NDQ) via communication minimization, with which agents act on their own most
of the time but occasionally send messages to other agents in order for
effective coordination. This framework hybridizes value function factorization
learning and communication learning by introducing two information-theoretic
regularizers. These regularizers are maximizing mutual information between
agents' action selection and communication messages while minimizing the
entropy of messages between agents. We show how to optimize these regularizers
in a way that is easily integrated with existing value function factorization
methods such as QMIX. Finally, we demonstrate that, on the StarCraft unit
micromanagement benchmark, our framework significantly outperforms baseline
methods and allows us to cut off more than $80\%$ of communication without
sacrificing the performance. The videos of our experiments are available at

and semi-quantum, or ""classical"" users. These restricted users are only allowed
to interact with the quantum channel in a limited manner. Originally introduced
to study the key-distribution problem, semi-quantum research has since
expanded, and continues to grow, with new protocols, security proof methods,
experimental implementations, and new cryptographic applications beyond key
distribution. Research in the field of semi-quantum cryptography requires new
insights into working with restricted protocols and, so, the tools and
techniques derived in this field can translate to results in broader quantum
information science. Furthermore, other questions such as the connection
between quantum and classical processing, including how classical information
processing can be used to counteract a quantum deficiency in a protocol, can
shed light on important theoretical questions.
  This work surveys the history and current state-of-the-art in semi-quantum
research. We discuss the model and several protocols offering the reader
insight into how protocols are constructed in this realm. We discuss security
proof methods and how classical post-processing can be used to counteract
users' inability to perform certain quantum operations. Moving beyond key
distribution, we survey current work in other semi-quantum cryptographic
protocols and current trends. We also survey recent work done in attempting to
construct practical semi-quantum systems including recent experimental results

throughout this survey, several open problems that we feel are important to

to obtain the solution. The MLP network is trained to select a low-complexity,
yet reliable, detector using instantaneous channel condition in the RE. We
first propose a method to generate a labeled dataset to select a low-complexity
detector. Then, the MLP is trained twice using quasi-Newton method to select a
reliable detector for each RE. The performance of online detector selection is
evaluated in 5G NR link level simulator in terms of BLER and the complexity is
quantified in terms of the number of Euclidean distance (ED) computations and
the number of real additions and multiplication. Results show that the
computational complexity in the MIMO detector can be reduced by ~10X using the
proposed method.

  Artefacts During Reconstruction for High-Quality Segmentation","Accepted for publication in IEEE TMI",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Segmenting anatomical structures in medical images has been successfully
addressed with deep learning methods for a range of applications. However, this
success is heavily dependent on the quality of the image that is being
segmented. A commonly neglected point in the medical image analysis community
is the vast amount of clinical images that have severe image artefacts due to
organ motion, movement of the patient and/or image acquisition related issues.
In this paper, we discuss the implications of image motion artefacts on cardiac
MR segmentation and compare a variety of approaches for jointly correcting for
artefacts and segmenting the cardiac cavity. The method is based on our
recently developed joint artefact detection and reconstruction method, which
reconstructs high quality MR images from k-space using a joint loss function
and essentially converts the artefact correction task to an under-sampled image
reconstruction task by enforcing a data consistency term. In this paper, we
propose to use a segmentation network coupled with this in an end-to-end
framework. Our training optimises three different tasks: 1) image artefact
detection, 2) artefact correction and 3) image segmentation. We train the
reconstruction network to automatically correct for motion-related artefacts
using synthetically corrupted cardiac MR k-space data and uncorrected
reconstructed images. Using a test set of 500 2D+time cine MR acquisitions from
the UK Biobank data set, we achieve demonstrably good image quality and high
segmentation accuracy in the presence of synthetic motion artefacts. We
showcase better performance compared to various image correction architectures.

the sympathetic cooling of a ferromagnetic YIG nanosphere with a spin-polarized
atomic gas. Particle-atom cloud coupling is mediated through the magnetic
dipole-dipole interaction. When the particle and atom oscillations are small
compared to their separation, the interaction potential becomes dominantly
linear which allows the particle to exchange energy with the $N$ atoms. While
the atoms are continuously Doppler cooled, energy is able to be removed from
the nanoparticle's motion as it exchanges energy with the atoms. The rate at
which energy is removed from the nanoparticle's motion was studied for three
species of atoms (Dy, Cr, Rb) by simulating the full $N+1$ equations of motion
and was found to depend on system parameters with scalings that are consistent
with a simplified model. The nanoparticle's damping rate due to sympathetic
cooling is competitive with and has the potential to exceed commonly employed
cooling methods.

to multi-shell data, it is not optimised to model the signal from multiple
tissue types. In this work, we introduce a new framework based on dRL - dubbed
Generalized Richardson Lucy (GRL) - that uses multi-shell data in combination
with user-chosen tissue models to disentangle partial volume effects and
increase the accuracy in FOD estimation. The optimal weighting of multi-shell
data in the fit and the robustness to noise and partial volume effects of GRL
was studied with synthetic data. Subsequently, we investigated the performances
of GRL in comparison to dRL on a high-resolution diffusion MRI dataset from the
Human Connectome Project and on an MRI dataset acquired at 3T on a clinical
scanner. The feasibility of including intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM)
effects in the modelling was studied on a third dataset. Results of simulations
show that GRL can robustly disentangle different tissue types at SNR above 20
and improves the angular accuracy of the FOD estimation. On real data, GRL
provides signal fraction maps that are physiologically plausible and consistent
between datasets. When considering IVIM effects, high blood pseudo-diffusion
fraction is observed in the medial temporal lobe and in the sagittal sinus. In
comparison to dRL, GRL provides sharper FODs and less spurious peaks in
presence of partial volume effects and results in a better tract termination at
the grey/white matter interface or at the outer cortical surface. In
conclusion, GRL offers a new modular and flexible framework to perform
spherical deconvolution of multi-shell data.

the main property modulating the slope of the RMP, we find that it causes other
correlations that are more easily testable observationally: at fixed stellar

essential for effective disease management and delivery of medication and
treatment. This research develops automatic methods for detecting brain imaging
preclinical biomarkers for Parkinson's disease (PD) by considering the novel
application of evolutionary algorithms. A fundamental novel element of this
work is the use of evolutionary algorithms to both map and predict the
functional connectivity in patients using resting state functional MRI data
taken from the PPMI to identify PD progression biomarkers. Specifically,
Cartesian Genetic Programming was used to classify DCM data as well as
time-series data. The findings were validated using two other commonly used
classification methods (Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines)
and by employing k-fold cross-validation. Across DCM and time-series analyses,
findings revealed maximum accuracies of 75.21% for early stage (prodromal) PD
patients versus healthy controls, 85.87% for PD patients versus prodromal PD
patients, and 92.09% for PD patients versus healthy controls. Prodromal PD
patients were classified from healthy controls with high accuracy - this is
notable and represents the key finding of this research since current methods
of diagnosing prodromal PD have both low reliability and low accuracy.
Furthermore, Cartesian Genetic Programming provided comparable performance
accuracy relative to ANN and SVM. Evolutionary algorithms enable us to decode
the classifier in terms of understanding the data inputs that are used, more
easily than in ANN and SVM. Hence, these findings underscore the relevance of
both DCM analyses for classification and CGP as a novel classification tool for
brain imaging data with medical implications for disease diagnosis,
particularly in early and asymptomatic stages.

often replaced by cheap surrogates, which can be obtained by interpolation.
Full grid interpolation methods suffer from the so-called curse of
dimensionality, rendering them infeasible if the parameter domain of the
function is higher-dimensional (four or more parameters). Sparse grids
constitute a discretization method that drastically eases the curse, while the
approximation quality deteriorates only insignificantly. However, conventional
basis functions such as piecewise linear functions are not smooth (continuously
differentiable). Hence, these basis functions are unsuitable for applications
in which gradients are required. One example for such an application is
gradient-based optimization, in which the availability of gradients greatly
improves the speed of convergence and the accuracy of the results.
  This thesis demonstrates that hierarchical B-splines on sparse grids are
well-suited for obtaining smooth interpolants for higher dimensionalities. The
thesis is organized in two main parts: In the first part, we derive new
B-spline bases on sparse grids and study their implications on theory and
algorithms. In the second part, we consider three real-world applications in

optimization problems of these applications can be solved accurately and

the measurement uncertainty model is more accurately characterized, which

Particularly, we focus on the Massively Parallel Computations (MPC) model,
which is the standard theoretical model for modern parallel frameworks such as
MapReduce, Hadoop, or Spark. We consider the truly sublinear regime of MPC for
graph problems where the space per machine is $n^\delta$ for some desirably
small constant $\delta \in (0, 1)$.
  We present an algorithm that for graphs with diameter $D$ in the wide range
$[\log^{\epsilon} n, n]$, takes $O(\log D)$ rounds to identify the connected
components and takes $O(\log \log n)$ rounds for all other graphs. The
algorithm is randomized, succeeds with high probability, does not require prior
knowledge of $D$, and uses an optimal total space of $O(m)$. We complement this
by showing a conditional lower-bound based on the widely believed TwoCycle
conjecture that $\Omega(\log D)$ rounds are indeed necessary in this setting.
  Studying parallel connectivity algorithms received a resurgence of interest
after the pioneering work of Andoni et al. [FOCS 2018] who presented an
algorithm with $O(\log D \cdot \log \log n)$ round-complexity. Our algorithm
improves this result for the whole range of values of $D$ and almost settles
the problem due to the conditional lower-bound.
  Additionally, we show that with minimal adjustments, our algorithm can also
be implemented in a variant of the (CRCW) PRAM in asymptotically the same

by the imposition of a converging flow to form and destabilize a flux rope,
producing an eruption. We examine the quantities responsible for plasma heating
and cooling during the eruption, including thermal conduction, radiation,
adiabatic effects, coronal heating, and ohmic heating. We find that ohmic
heating is an important contributor to hot temperatures in the current sheet
region early in the eruption, but in the late phase adiabatic compression plays
an important role in heating the plasma there. Thermal conduction also plays an
important role in the transport of thermal energy away from the current sheet
region throughout the reconnection process, producing a ``thermal halo'' and
widening the region of high temperatures. We simulate emission from solar
telescopes for this eruption and find that there is evidence for emission from
heated plasma above the flare loops late in the eruption, when the adiabatic
heating is the dominant heating term. These results provide an explanation for
hot supra-arcade plasma sheets that are often observed in X-rays and extreme
ultraviolet wavelengths during the decay phase of large flares.

non-singular symplectic form and $d$ conserved quantities (in addition to the
Hamiltonian), one expects that generically ${\mathcal L}$, the linearization
around a periodic traveling wave, will have a $2d$ dimensional generalized
kernel, with a particular Jordan structure: The kernel of ${\mathcal L}$ is
expected to be $d$ dimensional, the first generalized kernel is expected to be
$d$ dimensional, and there are expected to be no higher generalized kernels.
The breakup of this $2d$ dimensional kernel under perturbations arising from a
change in boundary conditions dictates the modulational stability or
instability of the underlying periodic traveling wave.
  This general picture is worked out in detail for the case of equations of NLS
type. We give explicit genericity conditions that guarantee that the Jordan
form is the generic one: these take the form of non-vanishing determinants of
certain matrices whose entries can be expressed in terms of a finite number of
moments of the traveling wave solution. Assuming that these genericity
conditions are met we give a normal form for the small eigenvalues that result
from the break-up of the generalized kernel, in the form of the eigenvalues of
a quadratic matrix pencil. We compare these results to direct numerical
simulation in a number of cases of interest: the cubic and quintic NLS
equations, for focusing and defocusing nonlinearities, subject to both
longitudinal and transverse perturbations. The longitudinal stability of
traveling waves of the cubic NLS has been previously studied using the
integrability: in this case our results agree with those in the literature. All
of the remaining cases appear to be new.

secure and high-bandwidth communication for many critical point-to-point
applications. While the spatial modes of light offer an additional degree of
freedom to increase the information capacity of an optical link, atmospheric
turbulence can introduce severe distortion to the spatial modes and lead to
data degradation. Here, we propose and demonstrate a vector-beam-based,
turbulence-resilient communication protocol, namely spatial polarization
differential phase shift keying (SPDPSK), that can encode a large number of
information levels using orthogonal spatial polarization states of light. We
show experimentally that the spatial polarization profiles of the vector modes
are resilient to atmospheric turbulence, and therefore can reliably transmit
high-dimensional information through a turbid channel without the need of any
adaptive optics for beam compensation. We construct a proof-of-principle
experiment with a controllable turbulence cell. Using 34 vector modes, we have
measured a channel capacity of 4.84 bits per pulse (corresponding to a data
error rate of 4.3\%) through a turbulent channel with a scintillation index
larger than 1. Our SPDPSK protocol can also effectively transmit 4.02 bits of
information per pulse using 18 vector modes through even stronger turbulence
with a scintillation index of 1.54. Our study provides direct experimental
evidence on how the spatial polarization profiles of vector beams are resilient
to atmospheric turbulence and paves the way towards practical, high-capacity,
free-space communication solutions with robust performance under harsh
turbulent environments.

underlying DWD distribution, and they are biased towards DWDs with higher LISA

prove finite-time blowup for this model equation, which shows that the identity
for enstrophy growth and the strain constraint space are not sufficient on

the finite-time blowup of this model equation is the self-amplification of
strain, which is consistent with recent research suggesting that strain
self-amplification, not vortex stretching, is the main mechanism behind the
turbulent energy cascade. Because the strain self-amplification model equation
is obtained by dropping certain terms from the full Navier-Stokes strain

Sub-kiloparsec measurements of the [CII] 158 micron and [NII] 205 micron line
in nearby galaxies have recently become available as part of the Key Insights
in Nearby Galaxies: a Far Infrared Survey with Herschel (KINGFISH) and Beyond

to PAH emission in these regions to compare photoelectric heating from PAH
molecules to cooling by [CII] in the neutral and ionized phases of the ISM. We
find that the [CII] emission originating in the neutral phase of the ISM does
not exhibit a deficit with respect to the infrared luminosity and is therefore
preferred over the [CII] emission originating in the ionized phase of the ISM

The standard cosmological model continues to be well fit using a small number
of parameters. No one expects this model to be complete and so we need to
continue to challenge it with data; moreover, it does not explain how galaxies
and other structures form. So, how do we improve the precision of our
understanding of structure formation within this model? Wavelengths from the
microwave to the submm will be particularly fruitful for answering this
question. That's because, in addition to the CMB anisotropies, there are other
signals that can be extracted from large maps at these wavelengths -
particularly the cosmic infrared and submm backgrounds, the thermal and kinetic
Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects, and CMB lensing. Such signals carry a wealth of
information about the cosmological model, as well as how dust, gas and
star-formation evolve within dark-matter halos. Cross-correlations between
these signals and those coming from the radio, optical and X-ray surveys, will
provide even more information. Canadians are already members of teams for
several related facilities and are working to be involved in others. In order
for Canada to be fully engaged in exploiting the detailed information coming
from these cosmological signatures, it is crucial that we find the resources to
participate competitively in a combination of projects currently being planned.
Examples include CMB-S4, CCAT-prime, AtLAST, a new camera for JCMT, balloon

a nonthermal component described by a power law (PL) with a high-energy

a bulk Lorentz factor, $\Gamma$ = $728 \substack{+75 \\ -93}$ assuming a
redshift of 1. The slope of the additional PL spectrum stays unchanged

function of time. A standard external shock model has been tested for the
additional PL component using the relation between the temporal and spectral
indices (the closure relation). Each set of spectral and temporal indices from

health of our oceans, the sustainability and profitability of fisheries, and
even acts to destabilize geopolitical relations. To achieve the United Nations'
Sustainable Development Goal of ""Life Below Water"", our ability to detect and
predict illegal fishing must improve. Recent advances have been made through
the use of vessel location data, however, most analyses to date focus on
anomalous spatial behaviors of vessels one at a time. To improve predictions,
we develop a method inspired by complex systems theory to monitor the anomalous
multi-scale behavior of whole fleets as they respond to nearby illegal
activities. Specifically, we analyze changes in the multiscale geospatial
organization of fishing fleets operating on the Patagonia Shelf, an important
fishing region with chronic exposure to illegal fishing. We show that legally
operating (and visible) vessels respond anomalously to nearby illegal
activities (by vessels that are difficult to detect). Indeed, precursor
behaviors are identified, suggesting a path towards pre-empting illegal
activities. This approach offers a promising step towards a global system for
detecting, predicting and deterring illegal activities at sea in near
real-time. Doing so will be a big step forward to achieving sustainable life

wavefield. An example of this is so-called vector data in which both the
pressure and particle velocity are recorded in marine data. We present a vector
acoustic full waveform inversion (VAFWI) method. We demonstrate the connection
of the VAFWI adjoint operator with inverse wavefield extrapolation and show
that under the assumption of a plane wave propagating towards an infinite flat
recording surface at normal incidence, the VAFWI adjoint is equivalent to
inverse extrapolation of the normal derivative of the recorded field. Thus,
unlike the conventional FWI adjoint, the VAFWI adjoint is an inverse wavefield
extrapolation operator. If these assumptions are violated, this equivalence
relation is no longer true and becomes an approximation. We argue that this has
implications in the handling of receiver ghosts by the two inversion methods:
in the VAFWI adjoint, the receiver ghosts interact constructively with the
back-propagated reflected field. We show numerically that the de-aliasing
property of vector data extends to VAFWI, which results in fewer artefacts in
VAFWI images compared to conventional FWI when data are spatially undersampled

asymptotically flat space, and their finite integrated versions have been
argued by Strominger and Zhiboedov to insert cosmic strings into the spacetime.
In this work, we argue for an alternative definition of the action of
superrotations on Minkowski space that avoids introducing any defects. This
involves realizing the finite superrotation not as a diffeomorphism between
spaces, but as a mapping of Minkowski space to itself that may be multivalued
or non-surjective. This eliminates any defects in the bulk spacetime at the
expense of allowing for defects in the boundary celestial sphere metric. We
further explore the geometry of the spatial surfaces in the superrotated
spaces, and note that they intersect null infinity at the singularity of the
superrotation, causing a breakdown in the large $r$ asymptotic expansion there.
To determine how these surfaces embed into Minkowski space, a derivation of the
finite superrotation transformation is presented in both Bondi and Newman-Unti
gauges. The latter is particularly interesting, since the superrotations are
shown to preserve the hyperbolic slicing of Minkowski space in Newman-Unti
gauge, and this gauge also provides a means for extending the geometry beyond
the Bondi coordinate patch. We argue that the new interpretation for the action
of superrotations on spacetime motivates consideration of a wider class of
celestial sphere metrics and asymptotic symmetry groups.

properties of their land, ocean, and frozen surfaces. Here we investigate the
effect of host star spectral energy distribution (SED) on the albedo of these
surfaces using a one-dimensional (1-D) energy balance model (EBM).
Incorporating spectra of M-, K-, G- and F-dwarf stars, we determined the effect
of varying fractional and latitudinal distribution of land and ocean surfaces
as a function of host star SED on the overall planetary albedo, climate, and
ice-albedo feedback response. While noting that the spatial distribution of
land masses on a given planet will have an effect on the overall planetary
energy balance, we find that terrestrial planets with higher average land/ocean
fractions are relatively cooler and have higher albedo regardless of star type.
For Earth-like planets orbiting M-dwarf stars the increased absorption of water
ice in the near-infrared (NIR), where M-dwarf stars emit much of their energy,
resulted in warmer global mean surface temperatures, ice lines at higher
latitudes, and increased climate stability as the ice-albedo feedback became
negative at high land fractions. Conversely, planets covered largely by ocean,
and especially those orbiting bright stars, had a considerably different energy
balance due to the contrast between the reflective land and the absorptive
ocean surface, which in turn resulted in warmer average surface temperatures
than land-covered planets and a stronger potential ice-albedo feedback. While
dependent on the properties of individual planetary systems, our results place
so constraints on a range of climate states of terrestrial exoplanets based on
albedo and incident flux.

able to efficiently dissipate heat generated from their operation, making the
thermal conductivity of the constituent materials an important parameter for
high-power applications. We have investigated the phonon-limited thermal
conductivity of AlN, GaN, and Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N using first-principles
calculations, with a focus on the effects of compositional and isotopic
disorder. Our Boltzmann-transport-equation calculations show that the maximum
thermal conductivity for AlN (GaN) is 348 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ (235 W m$^{-1}$
K$^{-1}$) for with pure $^{14}$N, and 292 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ for GaN with pure
$^{71}$Ga. Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N alloys reach a minimum thermal conductivity at Al
mole fractions of x = 0.60 to 0.71 over the 100-1000K temperature range. Our
results provide understanding on the effects of isotope disorder on the thermal
conductivity of AlN and GaN. We also present an analytical model for the
evaluation of the thermal conductivity of Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N alloys for
arbitrary composition and temperature, which can be applied for the thermal
design of AlGaN-based electronic and optoelectronic devices.

compare optimizers either assume these inclusion relationships are not

Coulomb interaction is described by the Ohno potential. The ground state is
renormalized by taking into account the Hartree-Fock term, and the optical
conductivities are obtained by numerically solving the equations of motion. The
absolute values of conductivity for third harmonic generation depend on the

a deeper understanding of the functionality and taxonomy of universities and
colleges and, in particular, how their various characteristics change with
size. Scaling has been a powerful tool for revealing systematic regularities in
systems across a range of topics from physics and biology to cities, and for
understanding the underlying principles of their organization and growth. Here,
we apply this framework to institutions of higher learning in the United States
and show that, like organisms, ecosystems and cities, they scale in a
surprisingly systematic fashion following simple power law behavior. We analyze
the entire spectrum encompassing 5,802 institutions ranging from large research
universities to small professional schools, organized in seven commonly used
sectors, which reveal distinct regimes of institutional scaling behavior.
Metrics include variation in expenditures, revenues, graduation rates and
estimated economic added value, expressed as functions of total enrollment, our
fundamental measure of size. Our results quantify how each regime of
institution leverages specific economies of scale to address distinct
priorities. Taken together, the scaling of features within a sector and shifts
in scaling across sectors implies that there are generic mechanisms and
constraints shared by all sectors which lead to tradeoffs between their
different societal functions and roles. We particularly highlight the strong
complementarity between public and private research universities, and community
and state colleges, four sectors that display superlinear returns to scale.

field extrapolation revealed that the jet was confined in a fan-spine magnetic

additional supervisions with partially labeled ground-truth, SGAN works
effectively for semi-supervised semantic segmentation as well. Experiments on

the ionized gas, the scattered emission from the polar dusty gas produces
self-absorption and neutral-like fluorescence lines, which are potentially a
unique probe of the kinematics of the polar dusty gas. The anomalously small Fe
Ka/Si Ka ratios of type II AGN observed previously can be naturally explained
by the polar dusty gas, because the polar emission does not suffer from heavy
absorption by the dense equatorial gas. The observed Si Ka lines of the
Circinus galaxy and NGC 1068 show blue-shifts with respect to the systemic

linear regression and logistic regression as special cases. For a given penalty
function $h$ and the corresponding penalized estimator $\hat\beta$, we
construct a quantity $\eta$, the first order expansion of $\hat\beta$, such
that the distance between $\hat\beta$ and $\eta$ is an order of magnitude
smaller than the estimation error $\|\hat{\beta} - \beta^*\|$. In this sense,
the first order expansion $\eta$ can be thought of as a generalization of
influence functions from the mathematical statistics literature to regularized
estimators in high-dimensions. Such first order expansion implies that the risk
of $\hat{\beta}$ is asymptotically the same as the risk of $\eta$ which leads
to a precise characterization of the MSE of $\hat\beta$; this characterization
takes a particularly simple form for isotropic design. Such first order
expansion also leads to inference results based on $\hat{\beta}$. We provide
sufficient conditions for the existence of such first order expansion for three
regularizers: the Lasso in its constrained form, the lasso in its penalized
form, and the Group-Lasso. The results apply to general loss functions under
some conditions and those conditions are satisfied for the squared loss in
linear regression and for the logistic loss in the logistic model.

present a new tune of JETSCAPE, called PP19, and validate it by comparison to
jet-based measurements in $p+p$ collisions, including inclusive single jet
cross sections, jet shape observables, fragmentation functions, charged hadron
cross sections, and dijet mass cross sections. These observables in $p+p$
collisions provide the baseline for their counterparts in nuclear collisions.
Quantifying the level of agreement of JETSCAPE results with $p+p$ data is thus
necessary for meaningful applications of JETSCAPE to A+A collisions. The
calculations use the JETSCAPE PP19 tune, defined in this paper, based on
version 1.0 of the JETSCAPE framework. For the observables discussed in this
work calculations using JETSCAPE PP19 agree with data over a wide range of
collision energies at a level comparable to standard Monte Carlo codes. These
results demonstrate the physics capabilities of the JETSCAPE framework and

machine learning model of classification for auto-tuning. This exploitation
enables the induction of more training samples without increasing the input

ClassyTune can effectively tune system performance to seven times higher for

detects objects in 2D (either RGB or pseudo-RGB constructed from depth). The
next step is to detect 3D objects within the 3D frustums these 2D detections
define. This is achieved by voxelizing parts of the frustums (since frustums
can be really large), instead of using the whole frustums as done in earlier
work. The main novelty of our system has to do with determining which parts (3D
proposals) of the frustums to voxelize, thus allowing us to provide high
resolution representations around the objects of interest. It also allows our
system to have reduced memory requirements. These 3D proposals are fed to an
efficient ResNet-based 3D Fully Convolutional Network (FCN). Our 3D detection
system is fast and can be integrated into a robotics platform. With respect to
systems that do not perform voxelization (such as PointNet), our methods can
operate without the requirement of subsampling of the datasets. We have also
introduced a pipelining approach that further improves the efficiency of our

consider sorting procedures applying an additive value model with diverse types
of marginal value functions (including linear, piecewise-linear, splined, and
general monotone ones) under a unified analytical framework. Differently from
the existing sorting methods that infer a preference model from crisp decision
examples, where each reference alternative is assigned to a unique class, our
framework allows to consider valued assignment examples in which a reference
alternative can be classified into multiple classes with respective credibility
degrees. We propose an optimization model for constructing a preference model
from such valued examples by maximizing the credible consistency among
reference alternatives. To improve the predictive ability of the constructed
model on new instances, we employ the regularization techniques. Moreover, to
enhance the capability of addressing large-scale datasets, we introduce a
state-of-the-art algorithm that is widely used in the machine learning
community to solve the proposed optimization model in a computationally
efficient way. Using the constructed additive value model, we determine both
crisp and valued assignments for non-reference alternatives. Moreover, we allow
the Decision Maker to prioritize importance of classes and give the method a
flexibility to adjust classification performance across classes according to

the receiver operating characteristic function associated with this decision

the decision function. It also examines the P-functional (the P-value
statistic) and its role in the decision-making process. The impetus of this
work is the continuing criticisms of statistical decision-making procedures
that use the P-functional and a level of significance (LoS) of 0.05. A point
made is that if one is going to use the value of the P-functional, then it
should be used in an equivalent manner as the most powerful decision function,
but if one wants to obtain from its value the degree of support for either
hypotheses, then the value of its density under the alternative is the proper
quantity to use. Replicability of results are discussed. Knowledge updating
through Bayes theorem when given the decision or the value of the P-functional
is also discussed, and it is argued that sequential learning is a coherent way
of finding the truth. But the impact of publication bias is also demonstrated
to be quite serious in the search for truth. It is argued that decision-makers
are free to choose their own LoS, since the additional summary measures will
automatically take their LoS choices into consideration. Three approaches for
choosing an optimal LoS are discussed and a procedure for sample size
determination is described. Ideas are illustrated by concrete problems and by
the lady tea-tasting experiment of Fisher which ushered null hypothesis

recent theoretical studies have tried to analyze their performance for solving

explanation of the behavior of EAs. Particularly, a simple multi-objective EA,
i.e., GSEMO, has been shown to be able to achieve good polynomial-time
approximation guarantees for submodular optimization, where the objective
function is only required to satisfy some properties but without explicit

and previous studies have considered the cases where the objective functions
are monotone submodular, monotone non-submodular, or non-monotone submodular.
To complement this line of research, this paper studies the problem class of
maximizing monotone approximately submodular minus modular functions (i.e.,
$f=g-c$) with a size constraint, where $g$ is a non-negative monotone
approximately submodular function and $c$ is a non-negative modular function,
resulting in the objective function $f$ being non-monotone non-submodular. We

nonsampling errors such as coverage error is inevitable. Coverage error which
can be classified into two types of under-count and overcount occurs when there
is no unique bijective (one-to-one) mapping between the individuals from the
census count and the target population -- individuals who usually reside in the
country (de jure residences). There are variety of reasons make the coverage
error happens including deficiencies in the census maps, errors in the field
operations or disinclination of people for participation in the undercount
situation and multiple enumeration of individuals or those who do not belong to
the scope of the census in the overcount situation. A routine practice for
estimating the net coverage error is subtracting the census count from the
estimated true population, which obtained from a dual system (or
capture-recapture) technique. Estimated coverage error usually suffers from
significant uncertainty of the direct estimate of true population or other
errors such as matching error. To rectify the above-mentioned problem and
predict a more reliable coverage error rate, we propose a set of
spatio-temporal mixed models. In an illustrative study on the 2010 census
coverage error rate of the U.S. counties with population more than 100,000, we
select the best mixed model for prediction by deviance information criteria
(DIC) and conditional predictive ordinate (CPO). Our proposed approach for
predicting coverage error rate and its measure of uncertainty is a full
Bayesian approach, which leads to a reasonable improvement over the direct
coverage error rate in terms of mean squared error (MSE) and confidence
interval (CI) as provided by the U.S. Census Bureau.

coherence tomography (OCT) systems and increase the transmission efficiency in
data acquisition and telemedicine. However, a low bit-depth will lead to the
degeneration of the detection sensitivity thus reduce the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of OCT images. In this paper, we propose to use deep learning for the
reconstruction of the high SNR OCT images from the low bit-depth acquisition.
Its feasibility was preliminarily evaluated by applying the proposed method to
the quantized $3\sim8$-bit data from native 12-bit interference fringes. We
employed a pixel-to-pixel generative adversarial network architecture in the
low to high bit-depth OCT image transition. Retinal OCT data of a healthy
subject from a homemade spectral-domain OCT system was used in the study.
Extensively qualitative and quantitative results show this deep-learning-based
approach could significantly improve the SNR of the low bit-depth OCT images
especially at the choroidal region. Superior similarity and SNR between the
reconstructed images and the original 12-bit OCT images could be derived when
the bit-depth $\geq 5$. This work demonstrates the proper integration of OCT
and deep learning could benefit the development of healthcare in low-resource
settings.

context of a very stiff sphere adhering to a compliant, isotropic, linear
elastic substrate, and experiencing adhesion and frictional slip relative to
each other. The adhesion is considered to be driven by very large attractive
tractions between the sphere and the substrate that can act only at very small
distances between them. As a consequence, the adhesion behavior can be
represented by the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts model, and this is assumed to
prevail also when frictional slip is occurring. Frictional slip is considered
to be resisted by a uniform, constant shear traction at the slipping interface,
a model that is considered to be valid for small asperities and for compliant
elastomers in contact with stiff material. A model for the interaction of
friction and adhesion, known to agree with some experimental data, is utilized.
This model is due to Johnson, and its adhesion-friction interaction is assumed
to stem, upon shrinkage of the contact area, from a postulated reversible
energy release associated with frictional slip. This behavior is considered to
arise from surface microstructures generated or eliminated by frictional slip,
where these microstructures store some elastic strain energy in a reversible
manner. The associated reversible energy release rate is derived from the
energy exchanges that occur in the system. The Johnson model, and an asymptotic
analysis of it for small amounts of frictional slip, is shown to be consistent
with the reversible energy release rate that we identify.

picture of electron transport through nanoscale systems. Although the exact
solution of the problem of AC quantum transport of noninteracting electrons has
been known for more than two decades, the treatment of correlated particles
presents a significant theoretical challenge. In this paper, using the
perturbative separation of fast electron tunnelling and slow driving
time-scales, we developed a practical approach for time-dependent quantum
transport with nonequilibrium Green's functions. The fast electronic dynamics
is associated with relative time whilst the slow driving is related to the
central time in the Green's functions. The ratio of characteristic electron
tunneling time over the period of harmonic driving is used as a small parameter
in the theory to obtain a convergent time-derivative expansions of the Green's
functions. This enables the algebraic solution of the Kadanoff-Baym equations
in Wigner space. Consequently, we produced analytical expressions for dynamical
corrections to advanced, retarded, and lesser Green's functions, as well as an
improved expression for AC electric current. The method developed is applicable
to the general case of multi-channel electron transport through a correlated
central region. The theory is applied to different transport scenarios:
time-dependent transport through a driven single-resonant level is compared to
exact results; and electron transport through a molecular junction described by
the Holstein model with a time-oscillating voltage bias is also investigated.

AT Cnc, the nebula in M22, and the possible Nova 101, Nova 483, and Nova 1437).
We consider the historical Far Eastern reports and after a careful re-reading
of the text we map the given information on the sky. In some cases, the
positions given in modern lists of classical nova-guest star-pairs turn out to
be wrong, or they have to be considered highly approximate: The historical
position, in most cases, should be transformed into areas at the celestial
sphere and not into point coordinates. Based on the correct information we
consider the consequences concerning the evolution of close binary systems.
However, the result is that none of the cases of cataclysmic variables
suggested to have a historical counterpart can be (fully) supported. As the
identification of the historical record of observation with the CVs known today
turns out to be always uncertain, a potential historical observation alone may
not be relied on to draw conclusions on the evolution of binaries. The
evolution scenarios should be derived from astrophysical observation and
modelling only.

on the question of whether an L1-norm robust optimization formulation can
recover a solution that is identical to the ground truth, under the scenario of
translation-only measurements corrupted exclusively by outliers and no noise;
we call this concept verifiability. On the theoretical side, we prove that the
verifiability of a problem depends only on the topology of the graph of
measurements, the edge support of the outliers, and their signs, while it is
independent of ground truth locations of the nodes, and of any positive scaling
of the outliers. On the computational side, we present a novel approach based
on the dual simplex algorithm that can check the verifiability of a problem,
completely characterize the space of equivalent solutions if they exist, and
identify subgraphs that are verifiable. As an application of our theory, we
provide a procedure to compute a priori probability of recovering a solution
congruent or equivalent to the ground truth given a measurement graph and the

uses mutual information to capture influence transition dynamics. EDTI uses a
novel intrinsic reward, called Value of Interaction (VoI), to characterize and
quantify the influence of one agent's behavior on expected returns of other

encouraged to coordinate their exploration and learn policies to optimize team

theoretically. We first present an empirical study on the robustness of the
neural ODE-based networks (ODENets) by exposing them to inputs with various
types of perturbations and subsequently investigating the changes of the
corresponding outputs. In contrast to conventional convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), we find that the ODENets are more robust against both random
Gaussian perturbations and adversarial attack examples. We then provide an
insightful understanding of this phenomenon by exploiting a certain desirable
property of the flow of a continuous-time ODE, namely that integral curves are
non-intersecting. Our work suggests that, due to their intrinsic robustness, it
is promising to use neural ODEs as a basic block for building robust deep
network models. To further enhance the robustness of vanilla neural ODEs, we
propose the time-invariant steady neural ODE (TisODE), which regularizes the
flow on perturbed data via the time-invariant property and the imposition of a
steady-state constraint. We show that the TisODE method outperforms vanilla
neural ODEs and also can work in conjunction with other state-of-the-art

it aims to identify both class labels and locations of objects by using

sometimes even highlights background regions. To resolve these limitations, we
propose to use activation maps, named combinational class activation maps

the lowest probability class. By using CCAM for localization, we suppress
background regions to help highlighting foreground objects more accurately. In
addition, we design the network architecture to consider spatial relationships
for localizing relevant object regions. Specifically, we integrate non-local
modules into an existing base network at both low- and high-level layers. Our
final model, named non-local combinational class activation maps (NL-CCAM),
obtains superior performance compared to previous methods on representative
object localization benchmarks including ILSVRC 2016 and CUB-200-2011.

on human interaction patterns, the contagion process and the pathogenesis
within hosts. The immune system follows a circadian rhythm and, consequently,
the chance of getting infected varies with the time of day an individual is
exposed to the pathogen. The movement and interaction of people also follow
24-hour cycles, which couples these two phenomena. We use a stochastic
metapopulation model informed by hourly mobility data for two medium-sized
Chinese cities. By this setup, we investigate how the epidemic risk depends on
the difference of the clocks governing the population movement and the immune
systems. In most of the scenarios we test, we observe circadian rhythms would
constrain the pace and extent of disease emergence. The three measures
(strength, outward transmission risk and introduction risk) are highly
correlated with each other. For example of the Yushu City, outward transmission
risk and introduction risk are correlated with a Pearson's correlation
coefficient of 0.83, and the risks correlate to strength with coefficients of
$-0.85$ and $-0.75$, respectively (all have $p<0.05$), in simulations with no
circadian effect and $R_0=1.5$. The relation between the circadian rhythms of
the immune system and daily routines in human mobility can affect the pace and

with controllable resources,this paper proposes an optimal dispatch method of
using three-phase distribution locational marginal prices (DLMPs) as effective
economic signals to incentivize prosumers' behaviors. In the proposed
three-phase DLMP model, DLMPs for both active power and reactive power are
calculated. To alleviate the imbalance, congestions and voltage violations in
active distribution networks (ADNs),the DSO and prosumers should be
coordinated. We develop such a coordinated control scheme for the DSO and
prosumers,in which the DSO generates and broadcasts three-phase DLMPs as price
signals to induce prosumers' behaviors. We prove that given the DLMPs for
active power and reactive power as settlement prices, the optimal dispatch of
the ADN will also maximize the surplus of prosumers. Therefore, the power
output of rational prosumers will match the optimal dispatch,resulting in
better operational conditions of ADNs. Then the three-phase
imbalance,congestions and voltage violations will be well reduced. Numerical
tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

divergence form with stationary random coefficients that have only slowly
decaying correlations. It deduces optimal estimates of the homogenization error
from optimal growth estimates of the (extended) corrector. In line with the
heuristics, there are transitions at dimension $d=2$, and for a
correlation-decay exponent $\beta=2$; we capture the correct power of
logarithms coming from these two sources of criticality.
  The decay of correlations is sharply encoded in terms of a multiscale
logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) for the ensemble under consideration ---
the results would fail if correlation decay were encoded in terms of an
$\alpha$-mixing condition. Among other ensembles popular in modelling of random
media, this class includes coefficient fields that are local transformations of
stationary Gaussian fields.
  The optimal growth of the corrector $\phi$ is derived from bounding the size
of spatial averages $F=\int g\cdot\nabla\phi $ of its gradient. This in turn is
done by a (deterministic) sensitivity estimate of $F$, that is, by estimating
the functional derivative $\frac{\partial F}{\partial a}$ of $F$ w.~r.~t.~the
coefficient field $a$. Appealing to the LSI in form of concentration of measure
yields a stochastic estimate on $F$. The sensitivity argument relies on a
large-scale Schauder theory for the heterogeneous elliptic operator
$-\nabla\cdot a\nabla$. The treatment allows for non-symmetric $a$ and for
systems like linear elasticity.

that their expression is robust with respect to sudden changes in the species
concentration, regardless the new positive equilibrium reached by the system.
Such a property has been proven to be fundamentally important in certain gene
regulatory networks and signaling systems. In the present paper, we
mathematically prove that a well-known class of ACR systems studied by Shinar
and Feinberg in 2010 hides an internal integral structure. This structure
confers these systems with a higher degree of robustness that what was
previously unknown. In particular, disturbances much more general than sudden
changes in the species concentrations can be rejected, and robust perfect
adaptation is achieved. Significantly, we show that these properties are
maintained when the system is interconnected with other chemical reaction
networks. This key feature enables design of insulator devices that are able to

theories, is at the center stage in investment industry today. The essence of
quantitative investment is the multi-factor model, which explains the
relationship between the risk and return of equities. However, the multi-factor
model generates enormous quantities of factor data, through which even
experienced portfolio managers find it difficult to navigate. This has led to
portfolio analysis and factor research being limited by a lack of intuitive
visual analytics tools. Previous portfolio visualization systems have mainly
focused on the relationship between the portfolio return and stock holdings,
which is insufficient for making actionable insights or understanding market
trends. In this paper, we present sPortfolio, which, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first visualization that attempts to explore the factor
investment area. In particular, sPortfolio provides a holistic overview of the
factor data and aims to facilitate the analysis at three different levels: a
Risk-Factor level, for a general market situation analysis; a
Multiple-Portfolio level, for understanding the portfolio strategies; and a
Single-Portfolio level, for investigating detailed operations. The system's
effectiveness and usability are demonstrated through three case studies. The
system has passed its pilot study and is soon to be deployed in industry.

hypothetical forbidden maximally entangled state.We find lobe-like structures
in the cross section which are regions where entanglement has the greatest

Second, the instance loss can reduce category variance according to

understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms is still lacking. Here, we
addressed these problems using supervised training of recurrent neural network

interval-tuned neurons, and compare or produce time intervals by scaling state
evolution speed. Temporal and non-temporal information are coded in subspaces
orthogonal with each other, and the state trajectories with time at different

geometry facilitates the decoding generalizability of temporal and non-temporal

feedforward sequences that mutually excite or inhibit depending on whether
their preferences of non-temporal information are similar or not. We identified
four factors that facilitate strong temporal signals in non-timing tasks,

In this paper, we propose a novel two-branch stripe-based and attribute-aware

embedding for vehicle Re-ID task. The two-branch neural network, consisting of
stripe-based branch and attribute-aware branches, can adaptively extract the
discriminative features from the visual appearance of vehicles. A horizontal
average pooling and dimension-reduced convolutional layers are inserted into
the stripe-based branch to achieve part-level features. Meanwhile, the
attribute-aware branch extracts the global feature under the supervision of
vehicle attribute labels to separate the similar vehicle identities with
different attribute annotations. Finally, the part-level and global features
are concatenated together to form the final descriptor of the input image for
vehicle Re-ID. The final descriptor not only can separate vehicles with
different attributes but also distinguish vehicle identities with the same
attributes. The extensive experiments on both VehicleID and VeRi databases show

In order to disentangle contributions from Tb and Ir magnetic sublattices,
experiments were performed at the Ir $L_3$ and Tb $M_5$ edges, which provide
selective sensitivity to Ir $5d$ and Tb $4f$ magnetic moments, respectively. At
the Ir $L_3$ edge, we found the onset of long-range ${\bf k}={\bf 0}$ magnetic
order below $T_{N}^\text{Ir}\sim$ 71 K, consistent with the expected signal of
all-in all-out (AIAO) magnetic order. Using a single-ion model to calculate
REXS cross-sections, we estimate an ordered magnetic moment of
$\mu_{5d}^{\text{Ir}} \approx 0.34(3)\,\mu_B$ at 5 K. At the Tb $M_5$ edge,
long-range ${\bf k}={\bf 0}$ magnetic order appeared below $\sim40$ K, also
consistent with an AIAO magnetic structure on the Tb site. Additional insight
into the magnetism of the Tb sublattice is gleaned from measurements at the
$M_5$ edge in applied magnetic fields up to 6 T, which is found to completely
suppress the Tb AIAO magnetic order. In zero applied field, the observed
gradual onset of the Tb sublattice magnetisation with temperature suggests that
it is induced by the magnetic order on the Ir site. The persistence of AIAO
magnetic order, despite the greatly reduced ordering temperature and moment
size compared to stoichiometric Tb$_{2}$Ir$_{2}$O$_{7}$, for which
$T_{N}^{\text{Ir}} =130$ K and $\mu_{5d}^{\text{Ir}}=0.56\,\mu_B$, indicates
that stuffing could be a viable means of tuning the strength of electronic

such as online advertising and recommender systems, whose features are usually
in multi-field form. The key of this task is to model feature interactions
among different feature fields. Recently proposed deep learning based models
follow a general paradigm: raw sparse input multi-filed features are first
mapped into dense field embedding vectors, and then simply concatenated
together to feed into deep neural networks (DNN) or other specifically designed
networks to learn high-order feature interactions. However, the simple
\emph{unstructured combination} of feature fields will inevitably limit the
capability to model sophisticated interactions among different fields in a
sufficiently flexible and explicit fashion.
  In this work, we propose to represent the multi-field features in a graph
structure intuitively, where each node corresponds to a feature field and
different fields can interact through edges. The task of modeling feature
interactions can be thus converted to modeling node interactions on the
corresponding graph. To this end, we design a novel model Feature Interaction
Graph Neural Networks (Fi-GNN). Taking advantage of the strong representative
power of graphs, our proposed model can not only model sophisticated feature
interactions in a flexible and explicit fashion, but also provide good model
explanations for CTR prediction. Experimental results on two real-world

occupying in some cases two or more disjoint regions of the space. The quantum

a particle, localized in some limited part of the wave-function. The present
article challenges the concept of particle. It proves in base of a variant of
the Tan, Walls and Collett experiment, that this concept leads to a situation
in which the particle has to be simultaneously in two places distant from one
another, situation that contradicts the very definition of a particle. Another
argument is based on a modified version of the Afshar experiment, showing that
the concept of particle is problematic. The concept of particle makes
additional difficulties when the wave-function passes through fields. An
unexpected possibility to solve these difficulties seems to arise from the
cavity quantum electrodynamics studies done recently by S. Savasta and his
collaborators. It involves virtual particles. One of these studies is briefly
described here. Though, experimental results are expected, so that it is too
soon to draw conclusions whether it speaks in favor, or against the concept of
particle.

Simulation with Flexible Probabilities (HS-FP) framework developed by Meucci.
The HS-FP framework is a flexible non-parametric estimation approach that
considers future asset class behavior to be conditional on time and market
environments, and derives a forward looking distribution that is consistent
with this view while remaining close as possible to the prior distribution. The
framework derives the forward looking distribution by applying unequal time and
state conditioned probabilities to historical observations of asset class
returns. This is achieved using relative entropy to find estimates with the
least distortion to the prior distribution. Here, we use the HS-FP framework on
South African financial market data for asset allocation purposes; by
estimating expected returns, correlations and volatilities that are better
represented through the measured market cycle. We demonstrated a range of state
variables that can be useful towards understanding market environments.
Concretely, we compare the out-of-sample performance for a specific
configuration of the HS-FP model relative to classic Mean Variance
Optimization(MVO) and Equally Weighted (EW) benchmark models. The framework
displays low probability of backtest overfitting and the out-of-sample net
returns and Sharpe ratio point estimates of the HS-FP model outperforms the
benchmark models. However, the results are inconsistent when training windows
are varied, the Sharpe ratio is seen to be inflated, and the method does not
demonstrate statistically significant out-performance on a gross and net basis.

VAE-BPTF which addresses the above issues. It uses multi-layer perceptron
networks to encode and share complex update information. The encoded
information is then reweighted per data instance to penalize common data values
before aggregated to compute the posterior parameters for the latent factors.
Under synthetic data evaluation, VAE-BPTF tended to recover the right number of

Magnetic fields can affect significantly the star formation process.
The theory of the magnetically-driven collapse in a uniform field predicts that
initially the contraction happens along the field lines. When the gravitational
pull grows strong enough, the magnetic field lines pinch inwards, giving rise
to a characteristic hourglass shape.
  Aims. We investigate the magnetic field structure of a young Class 0 object,
IRAS 15398-3359, embedded in the Lupus I cloud. Previous observations at large
scales suggest that this source evolved in an highly magnetised environment.
This object thus appears an ideal candidate to study the magnetically driven
core collapse in the low-mass regime.
  Methods. We have performed polarisation observations of IRAS 15398-3359 at
214$\mu$m using the SOFIA/HAWC+ instrument, thus tracing the linearly polarised
thermal emission of cold dust.
  Results. Our data unveil a significant bend of the magnetic field lines due
to the gravitational pull. The magnetic field appears ordered and aligned with
the large-scale B-field of the cloud and with the outflow direction. We
estimate a magnetic field strength of $B= 78 \mu$G, expected to be accurate
within a factor of two. The measured mass-to-flux parameter is $\lambda= 0.95$,
indicating that the core is in a transcritical regime.

  estimators",,,,,"stat.ME cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Conformal methods create prediction bands that control average coverage under
no assumptions besides i.i.d. data. Besides average coverage, one might also
desire to control conditional coverage, that is, coverage for every new testing
point. However, without strong assumptions, conditional coverage is
unachievable. Given this limitation, the literature has focused on methods with
asymptotical conditional coverage. In order to obtain this property, these
methods require strong conditions on the dependence between the target variable
and the features. We introduce two conformal methods based on conditional
density estimators that do not depend on this type of assumption to obtain
asymptotic conditional coverage: Dist-split and CD-split. While Dist-split
asymptotically obtains optimal intervals, which are easier to interpret than
general regions, CD-split obtains optimal size regions, which are smaller than
intervals. CD-split also obtains local coverage by creating a data-driven
partition of the feature space that scales to high-dimensional settings and by
generating prediction bands locally on the partition elements. In a wide
variety of simulated scenarios, our methods have a better control of
conditional coverage and have smaller length than previously proposed methods.

to present efficient generators to generate substitution boxes (S-boxes) and

These generators are based on a special class of ordered Mordell elliptic
curves. Rigorous analyses are performed to test the security strength of the
proposed generators. For a given prime, the experimental results reveal that
the proposed generators are capable of generating a large number of distinct,
mutually uncorrelated, cryptographically strong S-boxes and sequences of random

comparison that the proposed schemes can efficiently generate secure S-boxes

convolutional layer is designed to extract local patterns and lacks the ability

to complementing CNNs with the global modeling ability, especially by a family
of works on global feature interaction. In these works, the global context
information is incorporated into local features before they are fed into
convolutional layers. However, research on neuroscience reveals that the
neurons' ability of modifying their functions dynamically according to context

CNNs. Motivated by this, we propose one novel Context-Gated Convolution (CGC)
to explicitly modify the weights of convolutional layers adaptively under the
guidance of global context. As such, being aware of the global context, the
modulated convolution kernel of our proposed CGC can better extract
representative local patterns and compose discriminative features. Moreover,
our proposed CGC is lightweight and applicable with modern CNN architectures,
and consistently improves the performance of CNNs according to extensive

context-aware services and lighten the transmission burden, the raw data

However, the effect of computing on the overall information freshness is not
well understood. In this work, we first develop an analytical framework to
investigate the information freshness, in terms of peak age of information
(PAoI), of a computing enabled IoT system with multiple sensors. Specifically,
we model the procedure of computing and transmission as a tandem queue, and
derive the analytical expressions of the average PAoI for different sensors.
Based on the theoretical results, we formulate a min-max optimization problem
to minimize the maximum average PAoI of different sensors. We further design a
derivative-free algorithm to find the optimal updating frequency, with which
the complexity for checking the convexity of the formulated problem or
obtaining the derivatives of the object function can be largely reduced. The
accuracy of our analysis and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are
verified with extensive simulation results.

hence regarded as sharp probe to our better understanding on the basic property
of the corona. The launch of the first Chinese X-ray satellite Insight-HXMT has
large detection area at hard X-rays which provide almost unique chance to move
further in this research field. We report the first detection of the corona
cooling by Insight-HXMT from single short type-I burst showing up during {\bf

seconds and hard X-ray shortage is detected with significance 6.2~$\sigma$ in
40-70 keV. A cross-correlation analysis between the lightcurves of soft and
hard X-ray band, shows that the corona shortage lag the burst emission by 1.6
$\pm$1.2~s. These results are consistent with those derived previously from
stacking a large amount of bursts detected by RXTE/PCA within a series of {\bf

well for the first time to infer the burst influence upon the continuum
spectrum via performing the spectral fitting of the burst, which ends up with
the finding that hard X-ray shortage appears at around 40 keV in the continuum
spectrum. These results suggest that the evolution of the corona along with the
outburst{\bf /flare} of NS XRB may be traced via looking into a series of

components of modern game engines. With this model we generate a diverse,
realistic, and physically plausible dataset of human action videos, called PHAV
for ""Procedural Human Action Videos"". PHAV contains a total of 39,982 videos,
with more than 1,000 examples for each of 35 action categories. Our video
generation approach is not limited to existing motion capture sequences: 14 of
these 35 categories are procedurally defined synthetic actions. In addition,
each video is represented with 6 different data modalities, including RGB,
optical flow and pixel-level semantic labels. These modalities are generated
almost simultaneously using the Multiple Render Targets feature of modern GPUs.
In order to leverage PHAV, we introduce a deep multi-task (i.e. that considers
action classes from multiple datasets) representation learning architecture
that is able to simultaneously learn from synthetic and real video datasets,
even when their action categories differ. Our experiments on the UCF-101 and

the secrecy outage probability and the average secrecy capacity are derived.
Since the locations for both legitimate receiver and eavesdroppers are unknown
as well as random, the stochastic geometry method is introduced for problem
formulation. Moreover, accurate expressions with a low computational complexity
are obtained with the rigorous derivation. Simulation results verify the
correctness of our theoretical analysis.

advanced machine learning and other AI technologies both to automate parts of
the data pipeline and also to help find new scientific discoveries in the

learning has made dramatic breakthroughs. Google's DeepMind has now also used
deep learning technology to develop their AlphaFold tool to make predictions
for protein folding. Remarkably, they have been able to achieve some
spectacular results for this specific scientific problem. Can deep learning be
similarly transformative for other scientific problems? After a brief review of
some initial applications of machine learning at the Rutherford Appleton

composed of a number of small-capacity quantum circuits. Limitations in the
capacity of monolithic quantum computing systems can be overcome by using
distributed quantum systems which communicate with each other through known
communication links. In our previous study, an algorithm with an exponential
complexity was proposed to optimize the number of qubit teleportations required
for the communications between two partitions of a distributed quantum circuit.
In this work, a genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem in
a more efficient way. The results are compared with the previous study and we
show that our approach works almost the same with a remarkable speed-up.
Moreover, the comparison of the proposed approach based on GA with a random
search over the search space verifies the effectiveness of GA.

roles in astronomy. In order to investigate the nature and characteristics of
the motions of very faint objects, a flexibly-pointed instrument capable of
high astrometric accuracy is an ideal complement to current astrometric surveys
and a unique tool for precision astrophysics. Such a space-based mission will
push the frontier of precision astrometry from evidence of earth-massed
habitable worlds around the nearest starts, and also into distant Milky way
objects up to the Local Group of galaxies. As we enter the era of the James
Webb Space Telescope and the new ground-based, adaptive-optics-enabled giant
telescopes, by obtaining these high precision measurements on key objects that
Gaia could not reach, a mission that focuses on high precision astrometry
science can consolidate our theoretical understanding of the local universe,
enable extrapolation of physical processes to remote redshifts, and derive a
much more consistent picture of cosmological evolution and the likely fate of
our cosmos. Already several missions have been proposed to address the science
case of faint objects in motion using high precision astrometry ESA missions:
NEAT for M3, micro-NEAT for S1 mission, and Theia for M4 and M5. Additional new
mission configurations adapted with technological innovations could be
envisioned to pursue accurate measurements of these extremely small motions.
The goal of this white paper is to address the fundamental science questions
that are at stake when we focus on the motions of faint sky objects and to
briefly review quickly instrumentation and mission profiles.

  Neural Network",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Developing accurate, efficient, and robust closure models is essential in the
construction of reduced order models (ROMs) for realistic nonlinear systems,
which generally require drastic ROM mode truncations. We propose a deep
residual neural network (ResNet) closure learning framework for ROMs of
nonlinear systems. The novel ResNet-ROM framework consists of two steps: (i) In
the first step, we use ROM projection to filter the given nonlinear PDE and
construct a filtered ROM. This filtered ROM is low-dimensional, but is not
closed (because of the PDE nonlinearity). (ii) In the second step, we use
ResNet to close the filtered ROM, i.e., to model the interaction between the
resolved and unresolved ROM modes. We emphasize that in the new ResNet-ROM
framework, data is used only to complement classical physical modeling (i.e.,
only in the closure modeling component), not to completely replace it. We also
note that the new ResNet-ROM is built on general ideas of spatial filtering and
deep learning and is independent of (restrictive) phenomenological arguments,
e.g., of eddy viscosity type. The numerical experiments for the 1D Burgers
equation show that the ResNet-ROM is significantly more accurate than the
standard projection ROM. The new ResNet-ROM is also more accurate and
significantly more efficient than other modern ROM closure models.

  Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Chromosome enumeration is an essential but tedious procedure in karyotyping
analysis. To automate the enumeration process, we develop a chromosome
enumeration framework, DeepACEv2, based on the region based object detection
scheme. The framework is developed following three steps. Firstly, we take the
classical ResNet-101 as the backbone and attach the Feature Pyramid Network
(FPN) to the backbone. The FPN takes full advantage of the multiple level
features, and we only output the level of feature map that most of the
chromosomes are assigned to. Secondly, we enhance the region proposal network's
ability by adding a newly proposed Hard Negative Anchors Sampling to extract
unapparent but essential information about highly confusing partial
chromosomes. Next, to alleviate serious occlusion problems, besides the
traditional detection branch, we novelly introduce an isolated Template Module
branch to extract unique embeddings of each proposal by utilizing the
chromosome's geometric information. The embeddings are further incorporated
into the No Maximum Suppression (NMS) procedure to improve the detection of
overlapping chromosomes. Finally, we design a Truncated Normalized Repulsion
Loss and add it to the loss function to avoid inaccurate localization caused by
occlusion. In the newly collected 1375 metaphase images that came from a
clinical laboratory, a series of ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
each proposed module. Combining them, the proposed DeepACEv2 outperforms all
the previous methods, yielding the Whole Correct Ratio(WCR)(%) with respect to
images as 71.39, and the Average Error Ratio(AER)(%) with respect to
chromosomes as about 1.17.
