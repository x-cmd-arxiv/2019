  Evolutionary Network",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is an urgent need to apply face alignment in a memory-efficient and
real-time manner due to the recent explosion of face recognition applications.
However, impact factors such as large pose variation and computational
inefficiency, still hinder its broad implementation. To this end, we propose a
computationally efficient deep evolutionary model integrated with 3D Diffusion
Heap Maps (DHM). First, we introduce a sparse 3D DHM to assist the initial
modeling process under extreme pose conditions. Afterward, a simple and
effective CNN feature is extracted and fed to Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
for evolutionary learning. To accelerate the model, we propose an efficient
network structure to accelerate the evolutionary learning process through a
factorization strategy. Extensive experiments on three popular alignment
databases demonstrate the advantage of the proposed models over the
state-of-the-art, especially under large-pose conditions. Notably, the
computational speed of our model is 6 times faster than the state-of-the-art on
CPU and 14 times on GPU. We also discuss and analyze the limitations of our
models and future research work.

has received little attention and has not yet been well addressed. Existing
methods often used a bottom-up strategy to infer co-saliency in an image in
which salient regions are firstly detected using visual primitives such as
color and shape and then grouped and merged into a co-saliency map. However,
co-saliency is intrinsically perceived complexly with bottom-up and top-down
strategies combined in human vision. To address this problem, this study
proposes a novel end-to-end trainable network comprising a backbone net and two
branch nets. The backbone net uses ground-truth masks as top-down guidance for
saliency prediction, whereas the two branch nets construct triplet proposals
for regional feature mapping and clustering, which drives the network to be
bottom-up sensitive to co-salient regions. We construct a new dataset of 2,019
natural images with co-saliency in each image to evaluate the proposed method.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy with a running speed of 28 fps.

which could account for at least part of the dark matter content of the
Universe. It has been proposed that the production of dark photons in stellar
interiors could happen at a rate that depends on both, the dark photon mass and
its coupling to Standard Model particles (the kinetic mixing parameter $\chi$).
In this work we aim at exploring the impact of dark photon productions in the
stellar core of solar mass RGB stars during late evolutionary phases. We
demonstrate that near the so-called RGB bump, dark photons production may be an
energy sink for the star sufficiently significative to modify the extension of
the star convective zones. We show that Asteroseismology is able to detect such
variations in the structure, allowing us to predict an upper limit of $\rm 900\
eV$ and $5\times 10^{-15}$ for the mass and kinetic mixing of the dark photons,
respectively. We also demonstrate that additional constraints can be derived
from the fact that dark photons increase the luminosity of the RGB tip over the
current observational uncertainties. This work thus paves the way for an
empirical approach to deepen the study of such dark-matter particles.

character in the pattern matches a specific class of strings based on its type.
String matching is one of the most fundamental problems in computer science,
especially in the fields of bioinformatics and machine learning. Persistent
effort has led to a variety of algorithms for the problem since 1960s.
  With rise of big data and the inevitable demand to solve problems on huge
data sets, there have been many attempts to adapt classic algorithms into the
MPC framework to obtain further efficiency. MPC is a recent framework for
parallel computation of big data, which is designed to capture the
MapReduce-like algorithms. In this paper, we study the string matching problem
using a set of tools translated to MPC model. We consider three types of
wildcards in string matching:
  - '?' wildcard: In this setting, the pattern is allowed to contain special
'?' characters or don't cares that match any character of the text. String
matching with don't cares could be solved by fast convolutions, and we give a
constant round MPC algorithm for which by utilizing FFT in a constant number of
MPC rounds.
  - '+' wildcard: '+' wildcard is a special character that allows for arbitrary
repetitions of a character. When the pattern contains '+' wildcard characters,
our algorithm runs in a constant number of MPC rounds by a reduction from
subset matching problem.
  - '*' wildcard: '*' is a special character that matches with any substring of
the text. When '*' is allowed in the pattern, we solve two special cases of the
problem in logarithmic rounds.

instability to an optimization gap between the super-network and its

the true gradients while the original estimation does not. Our approach bridges
the gap from two aspects, namely, amending the estimation on the architectural

an open question in astrophysics. A possible mechanism to explain the magnetic
field generation is the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, since it is able to
transform the kinetic energy, in a shear flow, into magnetic energy. Through
the present work, we investigate the linear and non linear effects produced by
the magnetic susceptibility in the development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability in a relativistic plasma. The magnetic field in the system is
parallel to the flows and the susceptibility is assumed to be homogeneous,
constant in time, and equal in both fluids. In particular, we analyze the
instability in three different cases, when the fluids are diamagnetic,
paramagnetic, and when the susceptibility is zero. We compute the dispersion
relation in the linear regime and found that the interface between diamagnetic
fluids is more stable than the original case without magnetic susceptibility.
On the contrary, the paramagnetism makes the interface more unstable. This
behavior is increasingly important the higher the magnetization parameter.
Additionally, the interval of relativistic Mach numbers for which the interface
is unstable grows with the magnetic susceptibility, i.e., it is larger for
paramagnetic fluids. We check these analytical results with numerical
simulations, and explore the effect of the magnetic polarization in the non
linear regime. We found that the magnetic field is more amplified in
paramagnetic fluids than in diamagnetic ones. Surprisingly, the effect of the
susceptibility in the amplification is stronger when the magnetization
parameter is smaller. These results make the KH instability a more efficient
and effective amplification mechanism of seed magnetic fields when considering
the susceptibility of matter.

achievements in traffic engineering. However, the traffic micro-simulation
accuracy of car following models in a platoon level, especially during traffic
oscillations, still needs to be enhanced. Rather than using traditional
individual car following models, we proposed a new trajectory generation
approach to generate platoon level trajectories given the first leading
vehicle's trajectory. In this paper, we discussed the temporal and spatial
error propagation issue for the traditional approach by a car following block
diagram representation. Based on the analysis, we pointed out that error comes
from the training method and the model structure. In order to fix that, we
adopt two improvements on the basis of the traditional LSTM based car following
model. We utilized a scheduled sampling technique during the training process
to solve the error propagation in the temporal dimension. Furthermore, we
developed a unidirectional interconnected LSTM model structure to extract
trajectories features from the perspective of the platoon. As indicated by the
systematic empirical experiments, the proposed novel structure could
efficiently reduce the temporal and spatial error propagation. Compared with
the traditional LSTM based car following model, the proposed model has almost
40% less error. The findings will benefit the design and analysis of
micro-simulation for platoon level car following models.

behaviors are observed depending on the surfactant used to prepare the
precursor aqueous foam: (i) For a surfactant with low adsorption ability with
respect to cement grains, bubbles tend to decrease the yield stress of the

for bubble deformability. (ii) For a surfactant with high adsorption ability,
bubbles increase significantly the yield stress. This behavior is shown to

have been shown to generalize in a zero-shot cross-lingual setting. This
generalization ability has been attributed to the use of a shared subword
vocabulary and joint training across multiple languages giving rise to deep
multilingual abstractions. We evaluate this hypothesis by designing an
alternative approach that transfers a monolingual model to new languages at the
lexical level. More concretely, we first train a transformer-based masked
language model on one language, and transfer it to a new language by learning a
new embedding matrix with the same masked language modeling objective, freezing
parameters of all other layers. This approach does not rely on a shared
vocabulary or joint training. However, we show that it is competitive with
multilingual BERT on standard cross-lingual classification benchmarks and on a
new Cross-lingual Question Answering Dataset (XQuAD). Our results contradict
common beliefs of the basis of the generalization ability of multilingual
models and suggest that deep monolingual models learn some abstractions that
generalize across languages. We also release XQuAD as a more comprehensive
cross-lingual benchmark, which comprises 240 paragraphs and 1190

sample of 296 ULXs selected from the XMM-Newton archive. Among these 296, we
find 25 sources showing flux variability larger than a factor of 10, of which
17 show some evidence for (or are at least consistent with) exhibiting bi-modal

architecture search (NAS). Bayesian optimization (BO), which has long had
success in hyperparameter optimization, has recently emerged as a very
promising strategy for NAS when it is coupled with a neural predictor. Recent
work has proposed different instantiations of this framework, for example,
using Bayesian neural networks or graph convolutional networks as the
predictive model within BO. However, the analyses in these papers often focus
on the full-fledged NAS algorithm, so it is difficult to tell which individual
components of the framework lead to the best performance.
  In this work, we give a thorough analysis of the ""BO + neural predictor""
framework by identifying five main components: the architecture encoding,
neural predictor, uncertainty calibration method, acquisition function, and
acquisition optimization strategy. We test several different methods for each
component and also develop a novel path-based encoding scheme for neural
architectures, which we show theoretically and empirically scales better than
other encodings. Using all of our analyses, we develop a final algorithm called
BANANAS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on NAS search spaces. We

well-posedness theory for such PDEs in energy-critical spaces based on concepts

This is because the moment loss issue is the most severe for these potentials.
To get over this issue, our proof relies on a weighted hierarchy of norms that
depends on the number of spatial and velocity derivatives in an asymmetric way.
This hierarchy lets us take care of the terms that are affected by the moment

of its host galaxy (e.g., total stellar mass (M*), luminosity (Lhost)) suggest
an evolutionary connection. A powerful test of a co-evolution scenario is to
measure the relations MBH-Lhost and MBH-M* at high redshift and compare with
local estimates. For this purpose, we acquired HST imaging with WFC3 of 32
X-ray-selected broad-line AGN at 1.2<z<1.7 in deep survey fields. By applying
state-of-the-art tools to decompose the HST images including available ACS
data, we measured the host galaxy luminosity and stellar mass along with other
properties through the 2D model fitting. The black hole mass was determined
using the broad Halpha line, detected in the near-infrared with Subaru/FMOS,
which potentially minimizes systematic effects using other indicators. We find
that the observed ratio of MBH to total M* is 2.7 times larger at z~1.5 than in
the local universe, while the scatter is equivalent between the two epochs. A
non-evolving mass ratio is consistent with the data at the 2-3 sigma confidence
level when accounting for selection effects and their uncertainties. The
relationship between MBH-Lhost paints a similar picture. Therefore, our results
cannot distinguish whether SMBHs and their total M* and Lhost proceed in
lockstep or whether the growth of the former somewhat overshoots the latter,
given the uncertainties. Based on a statistical estimate of the bulge-to-total
mass fraction, the ratio MBH/M* is offset from the local value by a factor of
~7 which is significant even accounting for selection effects. Taken together,
these observations are consistent with a scenario in which stellar mass is
subsequently transferred from an angular momentum supported component of the
galaxy to the pressure supported one through secular processes or minor mergers
at a faster rate than mass accretion onto the SMBH.

previous estimates, which mostly relied on an ad-hoc modification of the

nominal pseudoscalar-pole contributions, when evaluated with modern input for
the relevant TFFs. We also comment on the status of the transversal SDCs and,
by matching to perturbative QCD, argue that the corresponding correction will

process) in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. In contrast to significantly
enhanced Pb abundances predicted by low-mass, low-metallicity AGB-models,
observations of Magellanic post-AGB stars show incompatibly low Pb abundances.
Observations of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars whose s-process
enrichments are accompanied by heavy elements traditionally associated with the
rapid neutron-capture process (r process) have raised the need for a
neutron-capture process operating at neutron densities intermediate to the s
and r process: the so-called i process. We study i-process nucleosynthesis with
single-zone nuclear-network calculations. Our i-process models can explain the
heavy-element abundance patterns measured in Magellanic post-AGB stars
including their puzzlingly low Pb abundances. Furthermore, the heavy-element
enhancements in the post-AGB and CEMP-i stars, particularly their Pb abundance,
allow us to characterise the neutron densities and exposures of the i process
that produced the observed abundance patterns. We find that the
lower-metallicity CEMP-i stars ($\left[ \mathrm{Fe} / \mathrm{H} \right]
\approx -2.5$) have heavy-element abundances best matched by models with higher
neutron densities and exposures ($\tau > 2.0 \, \mathrm{mbarn}^{-1}$) compared
to the higher-metallicity post-AGB stars ($\left[ \mathrm{Fe} / \mathrm{H}
\right] \approx -1.3$, $\tau < 1.3 \, \mathrm{mbarn}^{-1}$). This offers new
constraints and insights regarding the properties of i-process sites and
demonstrates that the responsible process operates on time scales of the order
of a few years or less.

isolate the influence of SFH on optical and near-infrared colours from 3200 to

that physically-motivated SFH variations modify galaxy colours along a single
direction in colour space: the SFH-direction. We find that the projection of a
galaxy's present-day colours onto the SFH-direction is almost completely
regulated by the fraction of stellar mass that the galaxy formed over the last
billion years. Together with cosmic downsizing, this results in galaxies
becoming redder as their host halo mass increases. We additionally study the
change in galaxy colours due to variations in metallicity, dust attenuation,
and nebular emission lines, finding that these properties vary broad-band
colours along distinct directions in colour space relative to the
SFH-direction. Finally, we show that the colours of low-redshift SDSS galaxies
span an ellipsoid with significant extent along two independent dimensions, and
that the SFH-direction is well-aligned with the major axis of this ellipsoid.
Our analysis supports the conclusion that variations in star formation history

  disc braking","Accepted to MNRAS Letters",,"10.1093/mnrasl/slz164",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During the runaway phase of their formation, gas giants fill their
gravitational spheres of influence out to Bondi or Hill radii. When runaway
ends, planets shrink several orders of magnitude in radius until they are
comparable in size to present-day Jupiter; in 1D models, the contraction occurs
on the Kelvin-Helmholtz time-scale $t_{\rm KH}$, which is initially a few
thousand years. However, if angular momentum is conserved, contraction cannot
complete, as planets are inevitably spun up to their breakup periods $P_{\rm
break}$. We consider how a circumplanetary disc (CPD) can de-spin a
primordially magnetized gas giant and remove the centrifugal barrier, provided
the disc is hot enough to couple to the magnetic field, a condition that is
easier to satisfy at later times. By inferring the planet's magnetic field from
its convective cooling luminosity, we show that magnetic spin-down times are
shorter than contraction times throughout post-runaway contraction: $t_{\rm
mag}/t_{\rm KH}\sim(P_{\rm break}/t_{\rm KH})^{1/21}\lesssim 1$. Planets can
spin down until they corotate with the CPD's magnetospheric truncation radius,
at a period $P_{\rm max}/P_{\rm break} \sim (t_{\rm KH}/P_{\rm break})^{1/7}$.
By the time the disc disperses, $P_{\rm max}/P_{\rm break}\sim 20-30$; further
contraction at fixed angular momentum can spin planets back up to $\sim$$10
P_{\rm break}$, potentially explaining observed rotation periods of giant
planets and brown dwarfs.

Submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stz3280",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We use N-body simulations to revisit the globular cluster (GC) ``timing
problem'' in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal (dSph). In agreement with earlier
work, we find that, due to dynamical friction, GCs sink to the center of dark
matter halos with a cuspy inner density profile but ``stall'' at roughly 1/3 of
the core radius ($r_{\rm core}$) in halos with constant-density cores. The
timescales to sink or stall depend strongly on the mass of the GC and on the
initial orbital radius, but are essentially the same for either cuspy (NFW) or
cored halos normalized to have the same total mass within $r_{\rm core}$.
Arguing against a cusp on the basis that GCs have not sunk to the center is
thus no different from arguing against a core, unless all clusters are today at
$\sim (1/3)\, r_{\rm core}$. This would imply a core radius exceeding $\sim 3$
kpc, much larger than seems plausible in any core-formation scenario. (The
average projected distance of Fornax GCs is $\langle R_{\rm GC,Fnx}\rangle\sim
1$ kpc and its effective radius is $\sim 700$ pc.) A simpler explanation is
that Fornax GCs have only been modestly affected by dynamical friction, as
expected if clusters started orbiting at initial radii of order $\sim 1$-$2$
kpc, just outside Fornax's present-day half-light radius but well within the
tidal radius imprinted by Galactic tides. This is not entirely unexpected.
Fornax GCs are significantly older and more metal-poor than most Fornax stars,
and such populations in dSphs tend to be more spatially extended than their
younger and more metal-rich counterparts. Contrary to some earlier claims, our
simulations further suggest that GCs do not truly ``stall'' at $\sim 0.3\,
r_{\rm core}$, but rather continue decaying toward the center, albeit at
reduced rates. We conclude that dismissing the presence of a cusp in Fornax
based on the spatial distribution of its GC population is unwarranted.

does not produce polarity reversal. Thus, the features of large-scale magnetic
fields in slowly rotating stars are expected to be different than stars having
solar-like DR. In this study, we perform mean-field kinematic dynamo modelling
of different stars at different rotation periods. We consider anti-solar DR for
the stars having rotation period larger than 30~days and solar-like DR
otherwise. We show that with particular $\alpha$ profiles, the dynamo model
produces magnetic cycles with polarity reversals even with the anti-solar DR
provided, the DR is quenched when the toroidal field grows considerably high
and there is a sufficiently strong $\alpha$ for the generation of toroidal
field. Due to the anti-solar DR, the model produces an abrupt increase of
magnetic field exactly when the DR profile is changed from solar-like to
anti-solar. This enhancement of magnetic field is in good agreement with the
stellar observational data as well as some global convection simulations. In
the solar-like DR branch, with the decreasing rotation period, we find the
magnetic field strength increases while the cycle period shortens. Both of
these trends are in general agreement with observations. Our study provides
additional support for the possible existence of anti-solar DR in slowly
rotating stars and the presence of unusually enhanced magnetic fields and
possibly cycles which are prone to production of superflare.

vector $\bf u$ in the form $\bf u=\bf u_1+\bf u_2$ where $\bf u_1$ solves a
system of homogeneous heat equations and $\bf u_2$ solves a system of
non-homogeneous heat equations with right-hand side ${\bf f}-\nabla P$.
Moreover $P=-{\cal L}( \nabla\cdot \bf f)$ where $\cal L$ denotes the harmonic
potential. Fast semi-analytic cubature formulas for computing the harmonic

cubature of $P$, which is a semi-analytic formula too. We derive fast and
accurate high order formulas for the approximation of $\bf u_1,\bf u_2$, $P$
and $\nabla P$. The accuracy of the method and the convergence order $2,4,6$

clusters and galaxies. They provide means to extract stellar masses, stellar
ages, star formation histories, chemical enrichment and dust content of
galaxies from their integrated spectral energy distributions, colours or
spectra. As most models, they contain uncertainties which can hamper our
ability to model and interpret observed spectra. This work aims at studying a
specific source of model uncertainty: the choice of an empirical vs. a
synthetic stellar spectral library. Empirical libraries suffer from limited
coverage of parameter space, while synthetic libraries suffer from modelling
inaccuracies. Given our current inability to have both ideal stellar-parameter
coverage with ideal stellar spectra, what should one favour: better coverage of
the parameters (synthetic library) or better spectra on a star-by-star basis
(empirical library)? To study this question, we build a synthetic stellar
library mimicking the coverage of an empirical library, and SPS models with
different choices of stellar library tailored to these investigations. Through
the comparison of model predictions and the spectral fitting of a sample of
nearby galaxies, we learned that: predicted colours are more affected by the
coverage effect than the choice of a synthetic vs. empirical library; the
effects on predicted spectral indices are multiple and defy simple conclusions;
derived galaxy ages are virtually unaffected by the choice of the library, but
are underestimated when SPS models with limited parameter coverage are used;
metallicities are robust against limited HRD coverage, but are underestimated
when using synthetic libraries.

along with a tricritical point (at $T_c$, the critical temperature of the host)
between them. The transition between these two criticalities is induced by the
transition in the support. The SOC$_{T=\infty}$ universality class is
characterized by the exponent of the avalanche size distribution
$\tau^{T=\infty}=1.27\pm 0.03$, consistent with the exponent of the size
distribution of the Barkhausen avalanches in amorphous ferromagnets (Phys. Rev.
L 84, 4705 (2000)). The tricritical point is characterized by its own critical
exponents. In addition to the avalanche exponents, some other quantities like
the average height, the spanning avalanche probability (SAP) and the average
coordination number of the Ising clusters change significantly the behavior at
this point, and also exhibit power-law behavior in terms of $\epsilon\equiv
\frac{T-T_c}{T_c}$, defining further critical exponents. Importantly the finite

behavior with exponents $\beta=0.19\pm 0.02$ and $\nu=0.75\pm 0.05$. A similar

and resonant conversion in neutron star magnetospheres. For decays, we show
that the brightness temperature signal, rather than flux, is a less ambiguous
measure for selecting candidate objects. This is owing principally to the
finite beam width of telescopes which prevents one from being sensitive to the
total flux from the object. With this in mind, we argue that the large
surface-mass-density of the galactic centre or the Virgo cluster centre offers
the best chance of improving current constraints on the axion-photon coupling
via spontaneous decays. For the neutron star case, we first carry out a
detailed study of mixing in magnetised plasmas. We derive transport equations
for the axion-photon system via a controlled gradient expansion, allowing us to
address inhomogeneous mass-shell constraints for arbitrary momenta. We then
derive a non-perturbative Landau-Zener formula for the conversion probability
valid across the range of relativistic and non-relativistic axions and show
that the standard perturbative resonant conversion amplitude is a truncation of
this result in the non-adiabatic limit. Our treatment reveals that that
infalling dark matter axions typically convert non-adiabatically in
magnetospheres. We describe the limitations of one-dimensional mixing equations
and explain how three-dimensional effects activate new photon polarisations,
including longitudinal modes and illustrate these arguments with numerical
simulations in higher dimensions. We find that the bandwidth of the radio
signal is dominated by Doppler broadening from the relative motion of the
neutron star with respect to the observer. Therefore, we conclude that the
radio signal from the resonant decay is weaker than previously thought, which
means one relies on local density peaks to probe weaker axion-photon couplings.

82 Survey (CNSS), a dedicated radio transient survey carried out with the Karl
G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). This transient, CNSS J001947.3+003527,
exhibited a turn-on over a timescale of $\lesssim$1 yr, increasing in flux
density at 3 GHz from $<0.14$ mJy in 2014 February to $4.4\pm0.1$ mJy in 2015
March, reaching a peak luminosity of $5\times10^{28} \text{erg s}^{-1}
\text{Hz}^{-1}$ around 2015 October. The association of CNSS J0019+00 with the
nucleus (Gaia and our VLBI positions are consistent to within 1 pc) of a nearby
S0 Seyfert galaxy at 77 Mpc, together with the radio spectral evolution,
implies that this transient is most likely a tidal disruption event (TDE). Our
equipartition analysis indicates the presence of a $\sim$15,000 km s$^{-1}$
outflow, having energy $\sim$10$^{49}$ erg. We derive the radial density
profile for the circumnuclear material in the host galaxy to be proportional to
$R^{-2.5}$. All of these properties suggest resemblance with radio-detected
thermal TDEs like ASASSN-14li and XMMSL1 J0740-85. No significant X-ray or
optical emission is detected from CNSS J0019+00, although this may simply be
due to the thermal emission being weak during our late-time follow-up
observations. From the CNSS survey we have obtained the first unbiased
measurement of the rate of radio TDEs, $R(>500 \mu{\rm Jy})$ of about
$2\times10^{-3}$ deg$^{-2}$, or equivalently a volumetric rate of about 10
Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. This rate implies that all-sky radio surveys such as the
VLA Sky Survey and those planned with ASKAP, will find many tens of radio TDEs
over the next few years.

reinforcement learning were found is projective simulation. Projective
simulation presents an agent-based reinforcement learning approach designed in
a manner which may support quantum walk-based speed-ups. Although classical
variants of projective simulation have been benchmarked against common

non-parametric approach for calibrating wheeled robots with arbitrary or

entire sensor/robot motion model in terms of odometry measurements. Different
from existing non-parametric approaches, our method relies on measurements from
the onboard sensors and hence does not require the ground truth information
from external motion capture systems. Alternatively, we propose a
computationally efficient approach that relies on the linear approximation of
the sensor motion model. Finally, we perform experiments to calibrate robots
with un-modelled effects to demonstrate the accuracy, usefulness, and

oracle, and hence, the rigid matrices are not explicit. In this work, we derive
an equivalence between rigidity and the systematic linear model of data
structures. For the $n$-dimensional inner product problem with $m$ queries, we
prove that lower bounds on the query time imply rigidity lower bounds for the
query set itself. In particular, an explicit lower bound of
$\omega\left(\frac{n}{r}\log m\right)$ for $r$ redundant storage bits would
yield better rigidity parameters than the best bounds due to Alon, Panigrahy,
and Yekhanin. We also prove a converse result, showing that rigid matrices
directly correspond to hard query sets for the systematic linear model. As an
application, we prove that the set of vectors obtained from rank one binary
matrices is rigid with parameters matching the known results for explicit sets.
This implies that the vector-matrix-vector problem requires query time
$\Omega(n^{3/2}/r)$ for redundancy $r \geq \sqrt{n}$ in the systematic linear
model, improving a result of Chakraborty, Kamma, and Larsen. Finally, we prove
a cell probe lower bound for the vector-matrix-vector problem in the high error

several applications in scientific computing, including indirect
arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian and rezoning moving mesh methods in numerical
solution of partial differential equations. In this paper, a high-order,
conservative, and positivity-preserving interpolation scheme is developed based
on the discontinuous Galerkin solution of a linear time-dependent equation on
deforming meshes. The scheme works for bounded but otherwise arbitrary mesh
deformation from the old mesh to the new one. The cost and positivity
preservation (with a linear scaling limiter) of the DG-interpolation are
investigated. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the properties of
the interpolation scheme. The DG-interpolation is applied to the rezoning
moving mesh DG solution of the radiative transfer equation, an
integro-differential equation modeling the conservation of photons and
involving time, space, and angular variables. Numerical results obtained for
examples in one and two spatial dimensions with various settings show that the
resulting rezoning moving mesh DG method maintains the same convergence order
as the standard DG method, is more efficient than the method with a fixed
uniform mesh, and is able to preserve the positivity of the radiative
intensity.

  Wave Propagation Velocity from Color-M-Mode Echocardiograms",,,,,"physics.med-ph q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: This work evaluates a new approach for calculating the
left-ventricular (LV) early filling propagation velocity (VP) from color M-Mode
(CMM) echocardiograms using wavelet analysis. Unlike current approaches, the
method requires no assumptions, user inputs, or heuristic conventions.
Background: Current methods for measuring VP using CMM echocardiography do not
account for the spatiotemporal variation of the filling wave propagation
velocity. They are instead confined by empirical assumptions and user inputs
that significantly hinder the accuracy of VP, subsequently limiting its
clinical utility. Methods: We evaluated three methods for measuring LV early
filling VP: conventional VP, the strength of propagation (VS), and VP
determined from the most energetically important wave (Peak-VW), using 125
patients (Group A) with normal filling (n=50), impaired relaxation (n=25),
pseudonormal filling (n=25) and restrictive filling (n=25), and in 69 patients
(Group B) with normal (n=32), dilated (n=15), and hypertrophic ventricles
(n=22). Results: Peak-VW most accurately distinguished normal left ventricles
from diseased ones. Specifically, for Group A which spanned the stages of
diastolic function, using receiver operator characteristics (ROC) and measuring
their corresponding area under the curve (AUC), the AUC for Peak-VW was 0.92,
versus 0.62 for conventional VP, 0.63 for VS and 0.58 for intraventricular
pressure difference (IVPD). These correspond to a 50-70% improvement in
classification ability. Similar improvements were found using Group B.
Conclusion: A new determination of the LV early filling using wavelet analysis,
Peak-VW, may provide a more accurate evaluation of diastolic function than the
standard method of determining Vp and enable better diagnostic classification
of patients suffering with diastolic dysfunction.

over-smoothing at the decision boundary of nodes. Here we propose a framework
to address their weaknesses via margin-based constraints on attention during

GATs and then develop an approach using constraint on the attention weights
according to the class boundary and feature aggregation pattern. Furthermore,
to alleviate the over-fitting problem, we propose additional constraints on the

for a variable stiffness transradial hand prosthesis that achieves
tele-impedance control through surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. This
interface, together with variable stiffness actuation (VSA), enables an amputee
to modulate the impedance of the prosthetic limb to properly match the
requirements of a task, while performing activities of daily living. Both the
desired position and stiffness references are estimated through sEMG signals
and used to control the VSA hand prosthesis. In particular, regulation of hand
impedance is managed through the impedance measurements of the intact upper
arm; this control takes place naturally and automatically as the amputee
interacts with the environment, while position of the hand prosthesis is
regulated intentionally by the amputee through the estimated position of the
shoulder. The proposed approach is advantageous, since the impedance regulation
takes place naturally without requiring amputees' attention and diminishing
their functional capability. Consequently, the proposed interface is easy to
use, does not require long training periods or interferes with the control of
intact body segments. The performance of the approach is evaluated through
human subject experiments where adequate estimation of references and
independent control of position and stiffness are demonstrated.

interdiffusion across the CGO-YSZ interface happens mainly during sintering at
high temperature, while during long-term operation at relatively lower

dynamics lasts long enough.The purpose of this work is not to supply an
entirely rigorous vindication, but to lay down a conceptual road map for the
microscopic foundations of the kinetic theory of special-relativistic plasma,
and to emphasize that a rigorous derivation seems feasible. Rather than working
with a BBGKY-type hierarchy of $n$-point marginal probability measures, the
approach proposed in this paper works with the distributional PDE of the actual
empirical 1-point measure, which involves the actual empirical 2-point measure
in a convolution term.The approximation of the empirical 1-point measure by a
continuum density, and of the empirical 2-point measure by a (tensor) product
of this continuum density with itself, yields a finite-$N$ Vlasov-like set of
kinetic equations which includes radiation-reaction and nontrivial finite-$N$
corrections to the Vlasov--Maxwell-BLTP model. The finite-$N$ corrections
formally vanish in a mathematical scaling limit $N\to\infty$ in which charges
$\propto 1/\surd{N}$. The radiation-reaction term vanishes in this limit, too.
The subsequent formal limit sending Bopp's parameter $\varkappa\to\infty$

applications. In order to provide insight onto the origin and mechanism of such
tunability, here we investigate the magnetic hyperfine and nuclear quadrupole
interactions for $^{159}$Tb nucleus in TbPc$_2$ (Pc=phthalocyanine)
single-molecule magnets using multireference ab-initio methods including
spin-orbit interaction. Since the electronic ground and first-excited
(quasi)doublets are well separated in energy, the microscopic Hamiltonian can
be mapped onto an effective Hamiltonian with an electronic pseudo-spin $S=1/2$.
From the ab-initio-calculated parameters, we find that the magnetic hyperfine
coupling is dominated by the interaction of the Tb nuclear spin with electronic
orbital angular momentum. The asymmetric $4f$-like electronic charge
distribution leads to a strong nuclear quadrupole interaction with significant
non-axial terms for the molecule with low symmetry. The ab-initio calculated
electronic-nuclear spectrum including the magnetic hyperfine and quadrupole
interactions is in excellent agreement with experiment. We further find that
the non-axial quadrupole interactions significantly influence the avoided level
crossings in magnetization dynamics and that the molecular distortions affect
mostly the Fermi contact terms as well as the non-axial quadrupole
interactions.

is very amenable to further improvement via environment interaction, allowing
it to scale to challenging long-horizon tasks. We simplify the long-horizon

time algorithm. This allows for a strict $\tilde{O}(n^\omega \log(n/\delta))$
time bound, instead of an expected one, and a simplified analysis, reducing the
length of their proof of their central path method by roughly half.
Derandomizing this algorithm was also an open question asked in Song's PhD
Thesis.
  The main tool to achieve our result is a new data-structure that can maintain
the solution to a linear system in subquadratic time. More accurately we are
able to maintain $\sqrt{U}A^\top(AUA^\top)^{-1}A\sqrt{U}\:v$ in subquadratic
time under $\ell_2$ multiplicative changes to the diagonal matrix $U$ and the
vector $v$. This type of change is common for interior point algorithms.
Previous algorithms [e.g. Vaidya STOC'89; Lee, Sidford FOCS'15; Cohen, Lee,
Song STOC'19] required $\Omega(n^2)$ time for this task. [...]

model the long-range dependencies in the feature maps. Accordingly,
self-attention complements PGAN to generate fine-grained samples that comprise

need for quantum error correction in a large-scale quantum computing device
demands a quantum non-demolition (QND) implementation. Unlike conventional

involves exquisite exposure of the system to the external circuitry for readout
while maintaining the coherence and integrity of the qubit. Here we show that
an electron spin qubit in silicon can be measured in a highly non-demolition

the qubit spin. The high non-demolition fidelity (99% on average) enables over
20 readout repetitions of a single spin state, yielding an overall average

strategy of the so-called Clean Numerical Simulation (CNS) in physical space is
proposed for spatio-temporal chaos, which is computationally much more
efficient than its predecessor (in spectral space). The strategy of the CNS is
to reduce both of the truncation and round-off errors to a specified level by
implementing high-order algorithms in multiple-precision arithmetic (with
sufficient significant digits for all variables and parameters) so as to
guarantee that numerical noise is below such a critical level in a temporal
interval $t\in[0,T_c]$ that corresponding numerical simulation remains reliable

Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) is used to illustrate its validity. As a
result, a reliable long-duration numerical simulation of the CGLE is achieved
in the whole spatial domain over a long interval of time $t\in[0,3000]$, which
is used as a reliable benchmark solution to investigate the influence of
numerical noise by comparing it with the corresponding ones given by the

investigated by considering the $^8$Li+$^{208}$Pb reaction. By decreasing the
projectile ground-state binding energy $\varepsilon_b$ from its known
experimental value, the complete fusion is shown to have insignificant
dependence on such variations, whereas the incomplete fusion strongly depends
on that. The complete and incomplete fusion cross sections are calculated by
using a combination of both continuum-discretized coupled-channel and sum-rule
models. To this end, an incident-energy dependent cut-off angular momentum
$L_c$ is first obtained by using the available complete fusion experimental
data, within an approach which is extended to model results obtained for other
incident-energies. An approximated fitted expression linking $L_c$ to the
well-known critical value $L_{\rm crit}$ derived by Wilczy\'nski [Nucl. Phys. A
216 (1973) 386] suggests a generalization of the corresponding sum-rule model
to energies around and below the Coulomb barrier.

forcing and the resulting long-term Earth-system response. Current ESS
estimates are subject to sizable uncertainties. Long-term carbon cycle models
can provide a useful avenue to constrain ESS, but previous efforts either use
rather informal statistical approaches or focus on discrete paleoevents. Here,
we improve on previous ESS estimates by using a Bayesian approach to fuse
deep-time CO2 and temperature data over the last 420 Myrs with a long-term
carbon cycle model. Our median ESS estimate of 3.4 deg C (2.6-4.7 deg C; 5-95%

chemical weathering relative to the a priori model configuration via reduced

  WirelessHART Networks","RTN, ECRTS 2019",,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Industrial process control systems are time-critical systems where reliable
communications between sensors and actuators need to be guaranteed within
strict deadlines to maintain safe operation of all the components of the
system. WirelessHART is the most widely adopted standard which serve as the
medium of communication in industrial setups due to its support for Time
Division Multiple Access (TDMA)based communication, multiple channels, channel
hopping, centralized architecture, redundant routes and avoidance of spatial
re-use of channels. However, the communication schedule in WirelessHART network
is decided by a centralized network manager at the time of network
initialization and the same communication schedule repeats every hyper-period.
Due to predictability in the time slots of the communication schedule, these
systems are vulnerable to timing attacks which eventually can disrupt the
safety of the system. In this work, we present a moving target defense
mechanism, the SlotSwapper, which uses schedule randomization techniques to
randomize the time slots over a hyper-period schedule, while still preserving
all the feasibility constraints of a real-time WirelessHART network and makes
the schedule uncertain every hyper-period. We tested the feasibility of the
generated schedules on random topologies with 100 simulated motes in Cooja
simulator. We use schedule entropy to measure the confidentiality of our
algorithm in terms of randomness in the time slots of the generated schedules.

in situations where the information is aggregated over multiple data atoms. The
aggregation can be over time or other features, such as geographical location.
We often have access to multiple aggregated views of the same data, each
aggregated in one or more dimensions, especially when data are collected or
measured by different agencies. For instance, item sales can be aggregated
temporally, and over groups of stores based on their location or affiliation.
However, data mining and machine learning models benefit from detailed data for
personalized analysis and prediction. Thus, data disaggregation algorithms are
becoming increasingly important in various domains. The goal of this paper is
to reconstruct finer-scale data from multiple coarse views, aggregated over
different (subsets of) dimensions. The proposed method, called PREMA, leverages
low-rank tensor factorization tools to fuse the multiple views and provide
recovery guarantees under certain conditions. PREMA can tackle challenging
scenarios, such as missing or partially observed data, double aggregation, and
even blind disaggregation (without knowledge of the aggregation patterns) using
a variant of PREMA called B-PREMA. To showcase the effectiveness of PREMA, the
paper includes extensive experiments using real data from different domains:
retail sales, crime counts, and weather observations.

retrieving person images from a large dataset, given a query image of the
person of interest. A key challenge is to learn person representations robust
to intra-class variations, as different persons can have the same attribute and
the same person's appearance looks different with viewpoint changes. Recent
reID methods focus on learning discriminative features but robust to only a
particular factor of variations (e.g., human pose), which requires
corresponding supervisory signals (e.g., pose annotations). To tackle this
problem, we propose to disentangle identity-related and -unrelated features
from person images. Identity-related features contain information useful for
specifying a particular person (e.g., clothing), while identity-unrelated ones
hold other factors (e.g., human pose, scale changes). To this end, we introduce
a new generative adversarial network, dubbed \emph{identity shuffle GAN}
(IS-GAN), that factorizes these features using identification labels without
any auxiliary information. We also propose an identity-shuffling technique to
regularize the disentangled features. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of IS-GAN, significantly outperforming the state of the art on

This arises as we move towards larger datasets that are difficult to annotate

from online repositories, where labels are inferred through automated
heuristics applied to the audio content or metadata. While learning from noisy
labels has been an active area of research in computer vision, it has received
little attention in sound event classification. Most recent computer vision
approaches against label noise are relatively complex, requiring complex
networks or extra data resources. In this work, we evaluate simple and
efficient model-agnostic approaches to handling noisy labels when training
sound event classifiers, namely label smoothing regularization, mixup and
noise-robust loss functions. The main advantage of these methods is that they
can be easily incorporated to existing deep learning pipelines without need for
network modifications or extra resources. We report results from experiments
conducted with the FSDnoisy18k dataset. We show that these simple methods can
be effective in mitigating the effect of label noise, providing up to 2.5\% of

side channel has three characteristics: extensive influence, potent threat, and
tough defense. The main reason for the micro-architecture side channel is
resource sharing. There are many reasons for resource sharing, one of which is
SMT (Simultaneous Multi-Threading) technology. In this paper, we define the SMT
Transient Channel, which uses the transient state of shared resources between
threads to steal information. To mitigate it, we designed a security
demand-based dynamic mitigation (DDM) to Mitigate the SMT transient channels.
The DDM writes the processes' security requirements to the CPU register sets,
and the operating system calls the HLT instruction to dynamically turn on and
off the hyper-threading according to the register values to avoid the side
channels caused by execution resource sharing. During the implementation of the
scheme, we modified the Linux kernel and used the MSR register groups of Intel
processor. The evaluation results show that DDM can effectively protect against
the transient side-channel attacks such as PortsMash that rely on SMT, and the
performance loss of DDM is less than 8%.

  with a convolutional neural network",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Applications of digital agricultural services often require either farmers or
their advisers to provide digital records of their field boundaries. Automatic
extraction of field boundaries from satellite imagery would reduce the reliance
on manual input of these records which is time consuming and error-prone, and
would underpin the provision of remote products and services. The lack of
current field boundary data sets seems to indicate low uptake of existing
methods,presumably because of expensive image preprocessing requirements and
local, often arbitrary, tuning. In this paper, we address the problem of field
boundary extraction from satellite images as a multitask semantic segmentation
problem. We used ResUNet-a, a deep convolutional neural network with a fully
connected UNet backbone that features dilated convolutions and conditioned
inference, to assign three labels to each pixel: 1) the probability of
belonging to a field; 2) the probability of being part of a boundary; and 3)
the distance to the closest boundary. These labels can then be combined to
obtain closed field boundaries. Using a single composite image from Sentinel-2,
the model was highly accurate in mapping field extent, field boundaries, and,
consequently, individual fields. Replacing the monthly composite with a
single-date image close to the compositing period only marginally decreased
accuracy. We then showed in a series of experiments that our model generalised
well across resolutions, sensors, space and time without recalibration.
Building consensus by averaging model predictions from at least four images
acquired across the season is the key to coping with the temporal variations of
accuracy. By minimising image preprocessing requirements and replacing local
arbitrary decisions by data-driven ones, our approach is expected to facilitate
the extraction of individual crop fields at scale.

not require large or paired training sets and often have good generalization
properties, since they learn general properties of CT image sets. Recent works
have shown the promising reconstruction performance of methods such as
PWLS-ULTRA that rely on clustering the underlying (reconstructed) image patches
into a learned union of transforms. In this paper, we propose a new
Supervised-UnsuPERvised (SUPER) reconstruction framework for LDCT image

(unsupervised) transform learning-based methods such as PWLS-ULTRA that involve
highly image-adaptive clustering. The SUPER model consists of several layers,

unsupervised iterative method that involves image-adaptive components. The
SUPER reconstruction algorithms are learned in a greedy manner from training

LDCT, and use much fewer iterations in the iterative reconstruction modules.

photospheric magnetic field obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager

opposite polarity strong field regions separated by a weak field corridor,
which widened as the active region evolved. On average the strong field regions
(corridor) show(s) redshifts of 5{--}10 (3{--}9)~km~s$^{-1}$ (depending on the
date of observation). There is, however, a narrow lane in the middle of the
corridor with near-zero Doppler shifts at all disk positions, suggesting that
any flows there are very slow. The Doppler velocity distributions in the
corridor seem to have two components---a low velocity component centered near 0
km/s and a high velocity component centered near 10~km~s$^{-1}$. The high
velocity component is similar to the velocity distributions in the strong field
regions, which have just one component. Both exhibit a small center-to limb
variation and seem to come from the same population of flows. To explain these
results, we suggest that the emission from the lower transition region comes
primarily from warm type II spicules, and we introduce the idea of a

considered as a pixel-wise classification problem in practice, and most
segmentation models use a pixel-wise loss as their optimization riterion.
However, the pixel-wise loss ignores the dependencies between pixels in an
image. Several ways to exploit the relationship between pixels have been
investigated, \eg, conditional random fields (CRF) and pixel affinity based
methods. Nevertheless, these methods usually require additional model branches,
large extra memories, or more inference time. In this paper, we develop a
region mutual information (RMI) loss to model the dependencies among pixels
more simply and efficiently. In contrast to the pixel-wise loss which treats
the pixels as independent samples, RMI uses one pixel and its neighbour pixels
to represent this pixel. Then for each pixel in an image, we get a
multi-dimensional point that encodes the relationship between pixels, and the
image is cast into a multi-dimensional distribution of these high-dimensional
points. The prediction and ground truth thus can achieve high order consistency
through maximizing the mutual information (MI) between their multi-dimensional
distributions. Moreover, as the actual value of the MI is hard to calculate, we
derive a lower bound of the MI and maximize the lower bound to maximize the
real value of the MI. RMI only requires a few extra computational resources in
the training stage, and there is no overhead during testing. Experimental
results demonstrate that RMI can achieve substantial and consistent
improvements in performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and CamVid datasets. The code is

We developed an understanding of the consequences of interactions on the

real-world examples of interacting tipping elements indicates that tipping
cascades with profound consequences may occur: the interacting Greenland ice
sheet and thermohaline ocean circulation might tip before the tipping points of
the isolated subsystems are crossed. The eutrophication of the first lake in a

their individual critical nutrient input levels. The possibility of emerging
cascading tipping dynamics calls for the development of a unified theory of
interacting tipping elements and the quantitative analysis of interacting
real-world tipping elements.

combinatorial codebook design so that the average Hamming weight of binary
codewords matches with arbitrary dimming target. An unsupervised DL technique
is employed for obtaining a neural network to replace the encoder-decoder pair
that recovers the message from the optically transmitted signal. In such a
task, a novel stochastic binarization method is developed to generate the set
of binary codewords from continuous-valued neural network outputs. For
universal support of arbitrary dimming target, the DL-based VLC transceiver is
trained with multiple dimming constraints, which turns out to be a constrained
training optimization that is very challenging to handle with existing DL
methods. We develop a new training algorithm that addresses the dimming
constraints through a dual formulation of the optimization. Based on the
developed algorithm, the resulting VLC transceiver can be optimized via the
end-to-end training procedure. Numerical results verify that the proposed
codebook outperforms theoretically best constant weight codebooks under various

$\Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon}})$, even for instances on HST metrics with

shows that the dependence of the approximation ratio for HST metrics on

voxel-wise approach, every voxel in the brain is jointly modeled with its
nearest neighbors, which are defined through a euclidian metric. MVDLM's have
been widely used in applications where the interest lies in to perform
predictions and/or analysis of covariance structures among time series. In this
context, our interest is rather to assess the dynamic effects which are related
to voxel activation. In order to do so, we develop three algorithms to simulate
online-trajectories related to the state parameter and with those curves or
simulated trajectories we compute a Monte Carlo evidence for voxel activation.

that our method can be viewed for the practitioners as a reliable tool for fMRI

Fourier analysis. As an application, we discover new efficient analytic
obstructions on the unitary categorification of fusion rings. We prove the
Hausdorff-Young inequality, uncertainty principles for fusion bialgebras and
their duals. We show that the Schur product property, Young's inequality and
the sum-set estimate hold for fusion bialgebras, but not always on their duals.
If the fusion ring is the Grothendieck ring of a unitary fusion category, then
these inequalities hold on the duals. Therefore, these inequalities are
analytic obstructions of categorification. We classify simple integral fusion
rings of Frobenius type up to rank 8 and of Frobenius-Perron dimension less
than 4080. We find 34 ones, 4 of which are group-like and 28 of which can be
eliminated by applying the Schur product property on the dual. In general,
these inequalities are obstructions to subfactorize fusion bialgebras.

of remote sensed imagery remains a challenge due to their complex structure,
variety of scales and diverse appearances. Existing convolutional neural
network (CNN)-based building extraction methods are complained that they cannot
detect the tiny buildings because the spatial information of CNN feature maps
are lost during repeated pooling operations of the CNN, and the large buildings
still have inaccurate segmentation edges. Moreover, features extracted by a CNN
are always partial which restricted by the size of the respective field, and
large-scale buildings with low texture are always discontinuous and holey when
extracted. This paper proposes a novel multi attending path neural network
(MAP-Net) for accurately extracting multiscale building footprints and precise
boundaries. MAP-Net learns spatial localization-preserved multiscale features
through a multi-parallel path in which each stage is gradually generated to
extract high-level semantic features with fixed resolution. Then, an attention
module adaptively squeezes channel-wise features from each path for
optimization, and a pyramid spatial pooling module captures global dependency
for refining discontinuous building footprints. Experimental results show that
MAP-Net outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms in boundary localization
accuracy as well as continuity of large buildings. Specifically, our method
achieved 0.68\%, 1.74\%, 1.46\% precision, and 1.50\%, 1.53\%, 0.82\% IoU score
improvement without increasing computational complexity compared with the
latest HRNetv2 on the Urban 3D, Deep Globe and WHU datasets, respectively. The
TensorFlow implementation is available at https://github.com/lehaifeng/MAPNet.

computation-intensive network models on embedded platforms with a minimal
compromise in model accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel approach, termed
as Variational Student, where we reap the benefits of compressibility of the
knowledge distillation (KD) framework, and sparsity inducing abilities of
variational inference (VI) techniques. Essentially, we build a sparse student
network, whose sparsity is induced by the variational parameters found via
optimizing a loss function based on VI, leveraging the knowledge learnt by an
accurate but complex pre-trained teacher network. Further, for sparsity
enhancement, we also employ a Block Sparse Regularizer on a concatenated tensor
of teacher and student network weights. We demonstrate that the marriage of KD
and the VI techniques inherits compression properties from the KD framework,
and enhances levels of sparsity from the VI approach, with minimal compromise
in the model accuracy. We benchmark our results on LeNet MLP and VGGNet (CNN)
and illustrate a memory footprint reduction of 64x and 213x on these MLP and
CNN variants, respectively, without a need to retrain the teacher network.
Furthermore, in the low data regime, we observed that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art Bayesian techniques in terms of accuracy.

with a wide range of applications. These systems are usually designed with
massive communication among the agents to minimize the error in pursuit of the
general goal of the entire system. In this work, we propose a novel approach
for Decentralized Cooperative Communication-less Multi-Agent Task Assignment
(DCCMATA) employing Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Here, each agent can assign
the optimal task by itself for itself. We design the system to automatically
maximize the success rate, achieving the collective goal effectively. To put it
another way, the agents optimally compute each following step, only by knowing
the current location of other agents, with no additional communication
overhead. In contrast with the previously proposed methods which rely on the
task assignment procedure for similar problems, we describe a method in which
the agents move towards the collective goal. This may lead to scenarios where
some agents not necessarily move towards the closest goal. However, the total
efficiency (makespan) and effectiveness (success ratio) in these cases are
significantly improved. To evaluate our approach, we have tested the algorithm
with a wide range of parameters(agents, size, goal). Our implementation
completely solves (Success Rate = %100) a 20*20 grid with 20 goals by 20 agents
in 7.9 s runtime for each agent. Also, the proposed algorithm runs with the
complexity of O(N^2I^2 + IN^4), where the I and N are the MCTS iterative index

establish the analogue of Bogomolov's decomposition for hypertoric varieties,

byproduct, we show that if two affine (or smooth) hypertoric varieties are

implies that the combinatorial classification actually gives the classification

outflows where beta is high and is characterized by a strong link between
plasma and electromagnetic fluctuations leading to momentum and energy
exchanges via anomalous viscosity and resistivity. But there is a second, low

scanners. The standard's goal is to enable comparison of different PET scanners
over a wide range of technologies and geometries used. In this work, we discuss
if the NEMA standard meets these goals and we point out potential flaws and
improvements to the standard.
  For the evaluation of spatial resolution, the NEMA standard mandates the use
of filtered backprojection reconstruction. This reconstruction method can
introduce star-like artifacts for detectors with an anisotropic spatial
resolution, usually caused by parallax error. These artifacts can then cause a
strong dependence of the resulting spatial resolution on the size of the
projection window in image space, whose size is not fully specified in the NEMA
standard.
  We show that the standard's equations for the estimation of the random rate
for PET systems with intrinsic radioactivity are circular and not satisfiable.
We compare random rates determined by a method based on the standard to to
random rates obtained using a delayed coincidence window and two methods based
on the singles rates.
  We discuss to what extend the NEMA standard's protocol for the evaluation of
the sensitivity is unclear and ambiguous, which can lead to unclear
interpretations of publicizeded results.
  The standard's definition of the recovery coefficients in the image quality
phantom includes the maximum activity in a region of interest, which causes a
positive correlation of noise and recovery coefficients. This leads to an
unintended trade-off between desired uniformity, which is negatively correlated
with variance (i.e. noise), and recovery.
  With this work, we want to start a discussion on possible improvements in a
next version of the NEMA NU-4 standard.

Here we predict a many-body critical phase in the one-dimensional extended

the wave functions in this phase generally exhibit a multifractal behavior. We
further study the half-chain entanglement entropy (EE) and thermalization

framework for general (state and input dependent) disturbances. This approach
uses an online constructed tube in order to tighten the nominal (state and
input) constraints. To facilitate an efficient online implementation, the shape
of the tube is based on an offline computed incremental Lyapunov function with
a corresponding (nonlinear) incrementally stabilizing feedback. Crucially, the
online optimization only implicitly includes these nonlinear functions in terms
of scalar bounds, which enables an efficient implementation. Furthermore, to
account for an efficient evaluation of the worst case disturbance, a simple
function is constructed offline that upper bounds the possible disturbance
realizations in a neighbourhood of a given point of the open-loop trajectory.
The resulting MPC scheme ensures robust constraint satisfaction and practical
asymptotic stability with a moderate increase in the online computational
demand compared to a nominal MPC. We demonstrate the applicability of the
proposed framework in comparison to state of the art robust MPC approaches with
a nonlinear benchmark example. This paper is an extended version of [1], and
contains further details and additional considers: continuous-time systems

an inherently nonlinear relation between the captured spectral information and
the corresponding materials. In recent years, deep learning has been recognized
as a powerful feature-extraction tool to effectively address nonlinear problems
and widely used in a number of image processing tasks. Motivated by those
successful applications, deep learning has also been introduced to classify
HSIs and demonstrated good performance. This survey paper presents a systematic
review of deep learning-based HSI classification literatures and compares
several strategies for this topic. Specifically, we first summarize the main
challenges of HSI classification which cannot be effectively overcome by
traditional machine learning methods, and also introduce the advantages of deep
learning to handle these problems. Then, we build a framework which divides the
corresponding works into spectral-feature networks, spatial-feature networks,
and spectral-spatial-feature networks to systematically review the recent
achievements in deep learning-based HSI classification. In addition,
considering the fact that available training samples in the remote sensing
field are usually very limited and training deep networks require a large
number of samples, we include some strategies to improve classification
performance, which can provide some guidelines for future studies on this
topic. Finally, several representative deep learning-based classification

the big data quality assessment has benefited less from this potential. There
is a vast variety of data sources in the big data domain that can be utilized
to improve the quality evaluation of big data. Including contextual information

mouse visual cortex encode the features of natural and artificial objects in a

investigate this by applying transfer learning to train a DNN on the neural
responses of a single animal and test its generalized performance across
multiple animals. Within a single animal, DNN is able to decode the neural
responses with as much as 100% classification accuracy. Across animals, this
accuracy is reduced to 91%. This study demonstrates the potential of utilizing
the DNN models as a computational framework to understand the neural coding

underpinned by elegant theory, stable training processes, and meaningful
manifold representations. However, they produce blurry images due to a lack of
explicit emphasis over high-frequency textural details of the images, and the
difficulty to directly model the complex joint probability distribution over
the high-dimensional image space. In this work, we approach these two
challenges with a novel wavelet space VAE that uses the decoder to model the
images in the wavelet coefficient space. This enables the VAE to emphasize over
high-frequency components within an image obtained via wavelet decomposition.
Additionally, by decomposing the complex function of generating
high-dimensional images into inverse wavelet transformation and generation of
wavelet coefficients, the latter becomes simpler to model by the VAE. We
empirically validate that deep generative models operating in the wavelet space
can generate images of higher quality than the image (RGB) space counterparts.
Quantitatively, on benchmark natural image datasets, we achieve consistently
better FID scores than VAE based architectures and competitive FID scores with
a variety of GAN models for the same architectural and experimental setup.
Furthermore, the proposed wavelet-based generative model retains desirable
attributes like disentangled and informative latent representation without
