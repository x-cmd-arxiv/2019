visual data for the purposes of training reinforcement learning algorithms can
be quite challenging and time-consuming. Methods for utilizing unlabeled data
can have a huge potential to further accelerate robotic learning. We consider
here the problem of performing manipulation tasks from pixels. In such tasks,
choosing an appropriate state representation is crucial for planning and
control. This is even more relevant with real images where noise, occlusions
and resolution affect the accuracy and reliability of state estimation. In this
work, we learn a latent state representation implicitly with deep reinforcement
learning in simulation, and then adapt it to the real domain using unlabeled
real robot data. We propose to do so by optimizing sequence-based self
supervised objectives. These exploit the temporal nature of robot experience,
and can be common in both the simulated and real domains, without assuming any
alignment of underlying states in simulated and unlabeled real images. We
propose Contrastive Forward Dynamics loss, which combines dynamics model
learning with time-contrastive techniques. The learned state representation
that results from our methods can be used to robustly solve a manipulation task
in simulation and to successfully transfer the learned skill on a real system.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches by training a vision-based
reinforcement learning agent for cube stacking. Agents trained with our method,
using only 5 hours of unlabeled real robot data for adaptation, shows a clear
improvement over domain randomization, and standard visual domain adaptation
techniques for sim-to-real transfer.

  Transfer",,,,,"cs.RO cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning robotic control policies in the real world gives rise to challenges
in data efficiency, safety, and controlling the initial condition of the
system. On the other hand, simulations are a useful alternative as they provide
an abundant source of data without the restrictions of the real world.
Unfortunately, simulations often fail to accurately model complex real-world
phenomena. Traditional system identification techniques are limited in
expressiveness by the analytical model parameters, and usually are not
sufficient to capture such phenomena. In this paper we propose a general
framework for improving the analytical model by optimizing state dependent
generalized forces. State dependent generalized forces are expressive enough to
model constraints in the equations of motion, while maintaining a clear
physical meaning and intuition. We use reinforcement learning to efficiently
optimize the mapping from states to generalized forces over a discounted
infinite horizon. We show that using only minutes of real world data improves
the sim-to-real control policy transfer. We demonstrate the feasibility of our
approach by validating it on a nonprehensile manipulation task on the Sawyer
robot.

We discover that the a posteriori covariance matrix of the signal model is the
discrete-time counterpart of an operator whose eigenfunctions are the famous
prolate spheroidal wave functions, introduced by Slepian and coworkers in the
1960's and widely studied in the signal processing literature although
motivated by a different class of problems. The special structure of the
covariance matrix is exploited to design an estimator for the hyperparameters
of the prior distribution which is essentially linear, based on subspace
identification. Bayesian analysis based on the estimated prior then shows that
the estimated center-frequency is asymptotically coincident with the MAP
estimate. This stochastic approach leads to consistent estimates, provides
uncertainty bounds and may advantageously supersede standard parametric
estimation methods which are based on iterative optimization algorithms of
local nature. Simulations show that the approach is quite promising and seems
to compare favorably with some classical methods.

unstable to superradiance. The rotational energy of the black hole is converted
into a non-axisymmetric, oscillating boson cloud which dissipates through the

wave observations by ground- or space-based detectors can be used to probe the
existence of dark particles weakly coupled to the Standard Model. In this work,
we focus on massive vector bosons, which grow much faster through
superradiance, and produce significantly stronger gravitational waves compared
to the scalar case. We use techniques from black hole perturbation theory to
compute the relativistically-correct gravitational wave signal across the
parameter space of different boson masses and black hole masses and spins. This
fills in a gap in the literature between flatspace approximations, which
underestimate the gravitational wave amplitude in the non-relativistic limit,
and overestimate it in the relativistic regime, and time-domain calculations,
which have only covered a limited part of the parameter space. We also identify
parameter ranges where overtone superradiantly unstable modes will grow faster
than the lower frequency fundamental modes. Such cases will produce a distinct
gravitational wave signal due to the beating of the simultaneously populated

The basis of our idea is to train machine learning models on several

performance of their corresponding model. As current machine learning models
are not able to strictly reflect human capabilities, including their

think that using machine learning-based pre-evaluation, as a pre-process of
standard user evaluations, should help researchers to perform a more exhaustive

evaluation by providing it better test cases. In this paper, we present the
results of two experiments we have conducted to assess how correlated the
performance of users and computer vision techniques can be. That study compares
two mainstream graph visualization techniques: node-link (\NL) and

every iteration finds a global minimum of the objective over a variable or a
subset of variables, while keeping the remaining variables constant. While for
some problems, coordinate minimization converges to a global minimum (e.g.,
convex differentiable objective), for general (non-differentiable) convex
problems this may not be the case. Despite this drawback, (block-)coordinate
minimization can be an acceptable option for large-scale non-differentiable
convex problems; an example is methods to solve the linear programming
relaxation of the discrete energy minimization problem (MAP inference in
graphical models). When block-coordinate minimization is applied to a general
convex problem, in every iteration the minimizer over the current coordinate
block need not be unique and therefore a single minimizer must be chosen. We
propose that this minimizer be chosen from the relative interior of the set of
all minimizers over the current block. We show that this rule is not worse, in
a certain precise sense, than any other rule.

the visible images, moving hyperbolically with respect to the nucleus. The

that Echeclus's coma is best explained as dominated by large blue dust grains,

the effect of subsequent mutations. The underlying mechanistic determinants of
such epistasis are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the physical dynamics of
a biological system can generically constrain epistasis. We analyze models and
experimental data on proteins and regulatory networks. In each, we find that if
the long-time physical dynamics is dominated by a slow, collective mode, then
the dimensionality of mutational effects is reduced. Consequently, epistatic
coefficients for different combinations of mutations are no longer independent,
even if individually strong. Such epistasis can be summarized as resulting from
a global non-linearity applied to an underlying linear trait, i.e., as global
epistasis. This constraint, in turn, reduces the ruggedness of the
sequence-to-function map. By providing a generic mechanistic origin for
experimentally observed global epistasis, our work suggests that slow
collective physical modes can make biological systems evolvable.

Approximated quadratic M-estimators (PRAM). This framework allows general
settings such as random errors lack of symmetry and homogeneity, or the
covariates are not sub-Gaussian. To reduce the possible bias caused by the
data's irregularity in mean regression, PRAM adopts a loss function with a
flexible robustness parameter growing with the sample size. Theoretically, we
first show that, in the ultra-high dimension setting, PRAM estimators have
local estimation consistency at the minimax rate enjoyed by the LS-Lasso. Then
we show that PRAM with an appropriate non-convex penalty in fact agrees with
the local oracle solution, and thus obtain its oracle property.
Computationally, we demonstrate the performances of six PRAM estimators using
three types of loss functions for approximation (Huber, Tukey's biweight and
Cauchy loss) combined with two types of penalty functions (Lasso and MCP). Our
simulation studies and real data analysis demonstrate satisfactory finite

For control design, certain constraints are usually enforced on the policies to
optimize, accounting for either the stability, robustness, or safety concerns
on the system. Hence, PO is by nature a constrained (nonconvex) optimization in
most cases, whose global convergence is challenging to analyze in general. More
importantly, some constraints that are safety-critical, e.g., the
$\mathcal{H}_\infty$-norm constraint that guarantees the system robustness, are
difficult to enforce as the PO methods proceed. Recently, policy gradient
methods have been shown to converge to the global optimum of linear quadratic
regulator (LQR), a classical optimal control problem, without
regularizing/projecting the control iterates onto the stabilizing set, its
(implicit) feasible set. This striking result is built upon the coercive
property of the cost, ensuring that the iterates remain feasible as the cost
decreases. In this paper, we study the convergence theory of PO for
$\mathcal{H}_2$ linear control with $\mathcal{H}_\infty$-norm robustness
guarantee. One significant new feature of this problem is the lack of
coercivity, i.e., the cost may have finite value around the feasible set
boundary, breaking the existing analysis for LQR. Interestingly, we show that
two PO methods enjoy the implicit regularization property, i.e., the iterates
preserve the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ robustness constraint as if they are
regularized by the algorithms. Furthermore, despite the nonconvexity of the
problem, we show that these algorithms converge to the globally optimal
policies with globally sublinear rates, avoiding all suboptimal stationary
points/local minima, and with locally (super-)linear rates under certain
conditions.

the dividing interface is perpendicular to the walls, and phases exhibit
symmetric density profiles. The possible experimental realization of this
behaviour (which in practical terms is precluded by jamming) in strictly
two-dimensional systems is discussed. Finally the phase behavior of a mixture
with periodic boundary conditions is analyzed and the differences and
similarities between the latter and the confined system are discussed. We claim
that, although exact calculations discard the existence of true phase
transitions in $1+\epsilon$-dimensional systems, Density Functional Theory is
still successful to describe packing properties of large clusters of particles.

the policies chosen by others. Therefore, a key issue in multi-agent systems
research is that of predicting the behaviours of others, and responding
promptly to changes in such behaviours. One obvious possibility is for each
agent to broadcast their current intention, for example, the currently executed
option in a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. However, this
approach results in inflexibility of agents if options have an extended
duration and are dynamic. While adjusting the executed option at each step
improves flexibility from a single-agent perspective, frequent changes in
options can induce inconsistency between an agent's actual behaviour and its
broadcast intention. In order to balance flexibility and predictability, we
propose a dynamic termination Bellman equation that allows the agents to
flexibly terminate their options. We evaluate our model empirically on a set of
multi-agent pursuit and taxi tasks, and show that our agents learn to adapt
flexibly across scenarios that require different termination behaviours.

improved pH resolution was realized while the devices were operated in a remote

theme in evolutionary biology. Ecological speciation occurs when reproductive
isolation between populations evolves as a result of niche differentiation.
Phytophagous insects represent model systems for the study of this evolutionary
process. The host-plants on which these insects feed and often spend parts of
their life cycle constitute ideal agents of divergent selection for these
organisms. Adaptation to feeding on different host-plant species can
potentially lead to ecological specialization of populations and subsequent
speciation. This process is thought to have given birth to the astonishing
diversity of phytophagous insects and is often put forward in macroevolutionary
scenarios of insect diversification. Consequently, numerous phylogenetic
studies on phytophagous insects have aimed at testing whether speciation driven
by host-plant adaptation is the main pathway for the diversification of the
groups under investigation. The increasing availability of comprehensive and
well-resolved phylogenies and the recent developments in phylogenetic
comparative methods are offering an unprecedented opportunity to test
hypotheses on insect diversification at a macroevolutionary scale, in a robust
phylogenetic framework. Our purpose here is to review the contribution of
phylogenetic analyses to investigate the importance of plant-mediated
speciation in the diversification of phytophagous insects and to present
suggestions for future developments in this field.

$\mathscr C(K)$ denote the set of convex polyhedra close to $K$ whose faces are
parallel to those of $K$. We show that, for sufficiently small $\epsilon$, all
$\epsilon$-minimizers belong to $\mathscr C(K)$.
  As a consequence of this result we obtain the following sharp stability
inequality for crystalline norms: There exist $\gamma=\gamma(K,n)>0$ and
$\sigma=\sigma(K,n)>0$ such that, whenever $|E|=|K|$ and $|E\Delta K|\le
\sigma$ then
  $$
  \mathscr F(E) - \mathscr F(K^a)\ge \gamma |E \Delta K^a| \qquad \text{for
some }K^a \in \mathscr C(K).
  $$ In other words, the Wulff energy $\mathscr F$ grows very fast (with power
$1$) away from the set $\mathscr C(K).$ The set $K^a \in \mathscr C(K)$
appearing in the formula above can be informally thought as a sort of
""projection"" of $E$ on the set $\mathscr C(K).$
  Another corollary of our result is a very strong rigidity result for
crystals: For crystalline surface tensions, minimizers of $\mathscr F(E)+\int_E
g$ with small mass are polyhedra with sides parallel to the ones of $K$. In
other words, for small mass, the potential energy cannot destroy the
crystalline structure of minimizers. This extends to arbitrary dimensions a
two-dimensional result obtained in [9].

properties derived from the ALMA data are presented and discussed in terms of
the overall detection rate in [CII] and FIR continuum, with the observed
signal-to-noise distribution. The sample is representative of the SFG
population in the main sequence at these redshifts. The overall detection rate
in [CII] is 64% for a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) threshold larger than 3.5
corresponding to a 95% purity (40% detection rate for S/N>5). Based on a visual
inspection of the [CII] data cubes together with the large wealth of ancillary

mergers, 20% extended and dispersion-dominated, 13% compact, and 11% rotating
discs, with the remaining 16% too faint to be classified. This diversity
indicates that a wide array of physical processes must be at work at this
epoch, first and foremost, those of galaxy mergers. This paper sets a reference
sample for the gas distribution in normal SFGs at 4<z<6.

drives vigorous atmospheric circulation that attempts to erase their large

Jupiter atmospheres can cause emergent properties of the atmosphere to be
time-variable. In this work, we study such weather in hot Jupiter atmospheres
using idealized cloud-free general circulation models with double-grey
radiative transfer. We find that hot Jupiter atmospheres can be time-variable
at the $\sim 0.1-1\%$ level in globally averaged temperature and at the $\sim
1-10\%$ level in globally averaged wind speeds. As a result, we find that
observable quantities are also time variable: the secondary eclipse depth can
be variable at the $\lesssim 2\%$ level, the phase curve amplitude can change
by $\lesssim 1\%$, the phase curve offset can shift by $\lesssim 5^{\circ}$,
and terminator-averaged wind speeds can vary by $\lesssim 2~
\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Additionally, we calculate how the eastern and
western limb-averaged wind speeds vary with incident stellar flux and the
strength of an imposed drag that parameterizes Lorentz forces in partially
ionized atmospheres. We find that the eastern limb is blueshifted in models
over a wide range of equilibrium temperature and drag strength, while the
western limb is only redshifted if equilibrium temperatures are
$\lesssim1500~\mathrm{K}$ and drag is weak. Lastly, we show that temporal
variability may be observationally detectable in the infrared through secondary

$\theta_{\mathrm{W}}$ are parameters of the Standard Model (SM) that enter
precision SM tests and play a fundamental r\^ole in beyond SM physics searches.
Their values are energy dependent, and non-perturbative hadronic contributions
are the main source of uncertainty to the theoretical knowledge of the running
with energy. We present a lattice study of the leading hadronic contribution to
the running of $\alpha$ and $\sin^2\theta_{\mathrm{W}}$. The former is related
to the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) function of electromagnetic currents,
and the latter to the HVP mixing of the electromagnetic current with the vector
part of the weak neutral currents. We use the time-momentum representation
(TMR) method to compute the HVP on the lattice, estimating both connected and
disconnected contributions on $N_{\mathrm{f}}=2+1$ non-perturbatively
$O(a)$-improved Wilson fermions ensembles from the Coordinated Lattice

compact binary mergers that produce a clear signal only in a single
gravitational wave detector, and marginal signals in other detectors. Such a
situation can arise when the detectors in a network have different
sensitivities, or when sources have unfavorable sky locations or orientations.
We start with a short list of loud single-detector triggers from regions of
parameter space that are empirically unaffected by glitches (after applying
signal-quality vetoes). For each of these triggers, we compute evidence for
astrophysical origin from the rest of the detector network by coherently
combining the likelihoods from all detectors and marginalizing over extrinsic
geometric parameters. We report the discovery of two new binary black hole
(BBH) mergers in the second observing run of Advanced LIGO and Virgo (O2), in
addition to the ones that were reported in Abbott et al. (2018) and Venumadhav
et al. (2019). We estimate that the two events have false alarm rates of one in
19 years (60 O2) and one in 11 years (36 O2).
  One of the events, GW170817A, has primary and secondary masses $m_1^{\rm src}
= 56_{-10}^{+16} \, M_\odot$ and $m_2^{\rm src} = 40_{-11}^{+10} \, M_\odot$ in
the source frame. The existence of GW170817A should be very informative about
the theoretically predicted upper mass gap for stellar mass black holes. Its
effective spin parameter is measured to be $\chi_{\rm eff} = 0.5 \pm 0.2$,
which is consistent with the tendency of the heavier detected BBH systems to
have large and positive effective spin parameters. The other event, GWC170402,

classifications of all scalar potentials can be performed when focusing on
regions in the field space in which one or several fields are large and close
to a boundary. To exemplify the constraints on such asymptotic flux
compactifications, we explicitly determine this classification for situations
in which two complex structure moduli are taken to be large. Our classification
captures, for example, the weak string coupling limit and the large complex
structure limit. We then show that none of these scalar potentials admits de
Sitter vacua at parametric control, formulating a new no-go theorem valid
beyond weak string coupling. We also check that the recently proposed
asymptotic de Sitter conjecture is satisfied near any infinite distance
boundary. Extending this strategy further, we generally identify the type of
fluxes that induce an infinite series of Anti-de Sitter vacua, thereby
generalizing the well-known Type IIA settings. Finally, we argue that also the
large field dynamics of any axion in complex structure moduli space is
universally constrained. Displacing such an axion by large field values will

dependence is in tension with current cosmological simulations. Lower mass ETGs
show extended star formation towards low redshift in agreement with recent
estimates from IFU surveys. All ETGs have main progenitors on the 'main
sequence of star formation' with the 'red sequence' appearing at $z \approx 2$.
Above this redshift, over 95 per cent of the ETG progenitors are star-forming.
More than 90 per cent of $z \approx 2$ 'main sequence' galaxies with $m_* >
10^{10}\mathrm{M}_\odot$ evolve into present-day ETGs. Above redshift 6, more
than 80 per cent of the observed stellar mass functions above
$10^{9}\mathrm{M}_\odot$ can be accounted for by ETG progenitors with $m_* >
10^{10}\mathrm{M}_\odot$. This implies that current and future high redshift
observations mainly probe the birth of present-day ETGs. The source code and

formation; however, cosmological simulations mostly use \textit{ad hoc}
feedback models for outflows, making outflow-related predictions from first
principles problematic. Recent small-box simulations resolve individual SNe
remnants in the interstellar medium (ISM), naturally driving outflows and
permitting a determination of the wind loading factors of energy $\eta_E$, mass
$\eta_m$, and metals $\eta_Z$. In this Letter, we compile small-box results,
and find consensus that the hot outflows are much more powerful than the cool
outflows: (i) hot outflows generally dominate the energy flux, and (ii) their
specific energy $e_{s,h}$ is 10-1000 times higher than cool outflows. Moreover,
the properties of hot outflows are remarkably simple: $e_{s,h} \propto
\eta_{E,h}/\eta_{m,h}$ is almost invariant over four orders of magnitude of
star formation surface density. Also, we find tentatively that
$\eta_{E,h}/\eta_{Z,h} \sim$ 0.5. If corroborated by more simulation data,
these correlations reduce the three hot phase loading factors into one.
Finally, this one parameter is closely related to whether the ISM has a
""breakout"" condition. The narrow range of \esh\ indicates that hot outflows
cannot escape dark matter halos with log $M_{\rm{halo}}\ [M_\odot] \gtrsim 12$.
This mass is also where the galaxy mass-metallicity relation reaches its
plateau, implying a deep connection between \textit{hot} outflows and galaxy
formation. We argue that hot outflows should be included explicitly in
cosmological simulations and (semi-)analytic modeling of galaxy formation.

partially transposed reduced density matrix. Our analytic predictions are
checked against a numerical implementation of the strong disorder
renormalization group and against exact computations for the XX spin chain (a
model in which free fermion techniques apply). Importantly, our results show
that the negativity and logarithmic negativity are not trivially related after
the average over the disorder.

research fields, including astrophysics, nuclear physics and gravitational wave
astronomy. Compact binary millisecond pulsars (with orbital periods shorter
than about a day) are a rapidly-growing pulsar population, and provide a good
opportunity to search for the most massive neutron stars. Applying a new method
to measure the velocity of both sides of the companion star, we previously
found that the compact binary millisecond pulsar PSR J2215+5135 hosts one of
the most massive neutron stars known to date, with a mass of 2.27$\pm$0.16
M$_\odot$ (Linares, Shahbaz & Casares, 2018). We reexamine the properties of
the 0.33 M$_\odot$ companion star, heated by the pulsar, and argue that
irradiation in this ""redback"" binary is extreme yet stable, symmetric and not
necessarily produced by an extended source. We also review the neutron star
mass distribution in light of this and more recent discoveries. We compile a
list of all (nine) systems with published evidence for super-massive neutron
stars, with masses above 2 M$_\odot$. We find that four of them are compact
binary millisecond pulsars (one black widow, two redbacks and one redback
candidate). This shows that compact binary millisecond pulsars are key to
constraining the maximum mass of a neutron star.

Our simple analytic 3D emissivity models are line-of-sight integrated, and
varied as a function of the Sun's vertical position, given a known distance to
the Galactic centre. We find a vertical position of the Sun of $z_0 = 15 \pm
17\,\mathrm{pc}$ above the Galactic plane, consistent with previous studies,
finding $z_0$ in a range between $5$ and $29\,\mathrm{pc}$. Even though the

possible biases in estimating the vertical extent of $\gamma$-ray emission if

find that interference effects between NP and QED amplitudes can be large,
pointing out the necessity of NLO contributions to be explicitly computed and

these models and the Standard Model (SM) at the parton level and the
reconstructed level. In the latter case, we focus on events selected requiring
two same-sign leptons and multiple jets. We investigate how the different
Lorentz structure of the light NP affects the kinematic hardness, the
polarization, the spin correlations, and the angular distributions of the
parton-level and/or final-state particles. We find that spin-2 light NP would
be identified by harder kinematics than the SM. We also show that the angular
separation between the same-sign leptons is a sensitive observable for spin-0
NP. The spin-0 and spin-2 NP cases would also yield a signal in $t\bar t
\gamma\gamma$ with the invariant mass of the photons indicating the mass of the
new particle. The spin-1 NP would be identified through an excess in four-top

material outside the ER. We find that the inner ejecta have been brightening at
a gradually slower rate and that the western side has been brighter than the
eastern side since ~7000 days. This is expected given that the X-rays from the
ER are most likely powering the ejecta emission. At the same time the optical
emission from the ER continues to fade linearly with time. The ER is expanding
at 680\pm 50 km/s, which reflects the typical velocity of transmitted shocks in
the dense hotspots. A dozen spots and a rim of diffuse H-alpha emission have
appeared outside the ER since 9500 days. The new spots are more than an order
of magnitude fainter than the spots in the ER and also fade faster. We show
that the spots and diffuse emission outside the ER may be explained by fast
ejecta interacting with high-latitude material that extends from the ER toward
the outer rings. Further observations of this emission will make it possible to
determine the detailed geometry of the high-latitude material and provide
insight into the formation of the rings and the mass-loss history of the

effectively detect anomalous nodes in large-scale graphs. Existing approaches
rely on connectivity and attributes of all nodes to assign an anomaly score per

adversaries, rendering these holistic approaches vulnerable. Alleviating this
limitation, GraphSAC randomly draws subsets of nodes, and relies on graph-aware
criteria to judiciously filter out sets contaminated by anomalous nodes, before
employing a semi-supervised learning (SSL) module to estimate nominal label
distributions per node. These learned nominal distributions are minimally
affected by the anomalous nodes, and hence can be directly adopted for anomaly
detection. Rigorous analysis provides performance guarantees for GraphSAC, by
bounding the required number of draws. The per-draw complexity grows linearly
with the number of edges, which implies efficient SSL, while draws can be run
in parallel, thereby ensuring scalability to large graphs. GraphSAC is tested

satisfying assignments of the variables representing the prime factors. The
main challenge in these cases is that, to compete with the Number Field Sieve,
the quantum SAT solver would need to be superpolynomially faster than classical
SAT solvers. In this paper the use of SAT solvers is restricted to a smaller
task related to factoring: finding smooth numbers, which is an essential step
of the Number Field Sieve. We present a SAT circuit that can be given to
quantum SAT solvers such as annealers in order to perform this step of
factoring. If quantum SAT solvers achieve any speedup over classical
brute-force search, then our factoring algorithm is faster than the classical
NFS.

rate $\lambda n/k_n$ (for some positive constant $\lambda$ and integer $k_n$).
Each incoming job consists of $k_n$ identical tasks that can be executed in

size (by introducing redundancy) so that the job is considered to be completed
when any $k_n$ replicas associated with it finish their service. Moreover, we
assume that servers can experience random slowdowns in their processing rate so
that the service time of a replica is the product of its size and a random
slowdown.
  First, we assume that the server slowdowns are shifted exponential and
independent of the replica sizes. In this setting we show that the delay of a
typical job is asymptotically minimized (as $n\to\infty$) when the number of
replicas per task is a constant that only depends on the arrival rate

  Second, we introduce a new model for the server slowdowns in which larger

schemes operating outside the resolved-sideband regime, to prepare and verify
both optical-mechanical and mechanical-mechanical entanglement. Our schemes
employ pulsed interactions with a duration much less than the mechanical period
and, together with homodyne measurements, can both generate and characterize
these types of entanglement. To improve the performance of our schemes, a
precooling stage comprising prior pulses can be utilized to increase the amount
of entanglement prepared, and local optical squeezers may be used to provide
resilience against open-system dynamics. The entanglement generated by our
schemes is quantified using the logarithmic negativity and is analysed with
respect to the strength of the pulsed optomechanical interactions for realistic
experimental scenarios including mechanical decoherence and optical loss. Two
separate schemes for mechanical entanglement generation are introduced and
compared: one scheme based on an optical interferometric design, and the other
comprising sequential optomechanical interactions. The pulsed nature of our
protocols provides more direct access to these quantum correlations in the time
domain, with applications including quantum metrology and tests of quantum
decoherence. By considering a parameter set based on recent experiments, the
feasibility to generate significant entanglement with our schemes, even with
large optical losses, is demonstrated.

of active polymer. Its level of activity can be controlled by changing the
temperature or by adding small amounts of alcohol to make the worms temporarily
inactive. We find that (i) shear thinning is reduced by activity, (ii) the
characteristic shear rate for the onset of shear-thinning is given by the time
scale of the activity, and (iii) the low shear viscosity as a function of

its eigenvalue decomposition acts as an analogue to the Fourier transform and
is known as the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). The line graph has a GFT that is
a direct analogue to the Discrete Cosine Transform Type II (DCT-II). Leveraging
Fourier transform properties, one can then define processing operations on this
graph structure that is loosely analogous to processing operations encountered
in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) theory. This raises the question of whether
well defined DSP-like operations can be derived from the GFT for more complex
graph structures. One potential approach to this problem is to perturb simple
graph structures and study the perturbation's impact on the graph Laplacian.
This paper explores this idea by examining the eigenvalue decomposition of the
Laplacian of undirected line graphs that undergo a single edge weight
perturbation. This single perturbation can perturb either an existing edge
weight or create new edge between distant unconnected vertices. The eigenvalue
bounds are expressed in closed form and agree with simulated examples. The
theory can be extended to include multiple perturbations such that the GFT can

densities obtained by the Jacchia-Bowman 2008 (JB2008) empirical model. Our
storms are grouped in different categories regarding their intensities as
indicated by minimum values of the SYM-H index. We then perform superposed
epoch analyses with storm main phase onset as zero epoch time. In general, we
find that orbital drag effects are larger for CHAMP (lower altitudes) in
comparison to GRACE (higher altitudes). Results show that storm-time drag
effects manifest first at high latitudes, but for extreme storms particularly
observed by GRACE stronger orbital drag effects occur during early main phase
at low/equatorial latitudes, probably due to heating propagation from high
latitudes. We find that storm-time orbital decay along the satellites' path
generally increases with storm intensity, being stronger and faster for the
most extreme events. For these events, orbital drag effects decrease faster
probably due to elevated cooling effects caused by nitric oxide, which
introduce modeled density uncertainties during storm recovery phase. Errors
associated with total orbit decay introduced by JB2008 are generally the
largest for the strongest storms, and increase during storm times, particular
during recovery phases. We discuss the implication of these uncertainties for
the prediction of collision between space objects at LEO during magnetic

of information sharing between agents, including sharing training symbols,
losses, and full gradients. We find that co-design (increased information
sharing) accelerates learning. Learning higher order modulation schemes is a
more difficult task, and the beneficial effect of co-design becomes more
pronounced as the task becomes harder.

performed at 11.3, 6.2, and 3.6 cm wavelength with the Effelsberg 100-m
telescope. At all wavelengths, the total and polarized emission is concentrated
in a ring-like structure between about 7 kpc and 13 kpc radius from the center.
Propagation of cosmic rays away from star-forming regions is evident. The ring
of synchrotron emission is wider than the ring of the thermal radio emission,
and the radial scale length of synchrotron emission is larger than that of
thermal emission. The polarized intensity from the ring varies
double-periodically with azimuthal angle, indicating that the ordered magnetic
field is almost oriented along the ring, with a pitch angle of -14{\deg} $\pm$
2{\deg}. Faraday rotation measures (RM) show a large-scale sinusoidal variation
with azimuthal angle, signature of an axisymmetric spiral (ASS) regular
magnetic field, plus a superimposed double-periodic variation of a bisymmetric
spiral (BSS) field with about 6x smaller amplitude. The dominating ASS field of
M 31 is the most compelling case so far of a field generated by the action of a
mean-field dynamo. The RM amplitude between 6.2 cm and 3.6 cm is about 50%
larger than between 11.3 cm and 6.2 cm, indicating that Faraday depolarization
at 11.3 cm is stronger than at 6.2 cm and 3.6 cm. The phase of the sinusoidal
RM variation of -7{\deg} $\pm$ 1{\deg} is interpreted as the average spiral
pitch angle of the regular field. The average pitch angle of the ordered field,
as derived from the intrinsic orientation of the polarized emission (corrected
for Faraday rotation), is significantly smaller: -26{\deg} $\pm$ 3{\deg}. The
difference in pitch angle of the regular and the ordered fields indicates that
the ordered field contains a significant fraction of an anisotropic turbulent
field that has a different pattern than the regular (ASS + BSS) field.

However, the astrophysical foreground from compact binaries may mask the SGWB,

In this paper, we propose a foreground cleaning method taking advantage of
gravitational wave observations in other frequency bands. We apply this method
to probing the SGWB with space-borne gravitational wave detectors, such as the
laser interferometer space antenna (LISA). We find that the spectral density of
the LISA-band astrophysical foreground from compact binaries (black holes and
neutron stars) can be predicted with percent-level accuracy assuming 10-years'
observations of third-generation GW detectors, e.g., cosmic explorer. While
this multi-band method does not apply to binary white dwarfs (BWDs) which
usually merger before entering the frequency band of ground-based detectors, we
limit our foreground cleaning to frequency higher than $\sim5$ mHz, where all
galactic BWDs can be individually resolved by LISA and the shape of the
spectral density of the foreground from extragalactic BWDs can be reconstructed
and/or modeled with certain uncertainties. After the foreground cleaning,
LISA's sensitivity to the primordial SGWB will be substantially improved for
either two LISA constellations where SGWB can be measured by cross correlating
their outputs or only one constellation with three spacecrafts where SGWB can
be measured by contrasting the responses of a signal channel and a null

quantitative phenomena, cause and effect must be taken into consideration

since cause and effect can be obscured by spurious, indirect influences. Modern
predictive techniques from machine learning are capable of capturing
high-dimensional, nonlinear relationships between variables while relying on
few parametric or probabilistic model assumptions. However, since these
techniques are associational, applied to observational data they are prone to
picking up spurious influences from non-experimental (observational) data,
making their predictions unreliable. Techniques from causal inference, such as
probabilistic causal diagrams and do-calculus, provide powerful (nonparametric)
tools for drawing causal inferences from such observational data. However,
these techniques are often incompatible with modern, nonparametric machine
learning algorithms since they typically require explicit probabilistic models.
Here, we develop causal bootstrapping for augmenting classical nonparametric
bootstrap resampling with information on the causal relationship between

it is possible to identify an interventional relationship from that data, new
data representing that relationship can be simulated from the original
observational data. In this way, we can use modern machine learning algorithms

incurs in producing this power. The OPF problem is non-convex due to the
sinusoidal nature of electrical generation and thus is difficult to solve.
Using small angle approximations leads to a convex problem known as DC OPF, but
this approximation is no longer valid when power grids are heavily loaded. Many

$\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}(n\geq 2)$ with any positive initial data. If a
superlinear radiation law $\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=u^{q}$ with $q>1$ is
imposed on a partial boundary $\Gamma_1\subseteq\partial\Omega$ which has a
positive surface area, then it has been known that the solution $u$ blows up in
finite time. However, if the partial boundary, on which the superlinear
radiation law is prescribed, is shrinking and is denoted as $\Gamma_{1,t}$ at
time $t$, then the solution may exist globally as long as the surface area
$|\Gamma_{1,t}|$ of $\Gamma_{1,t}$ decays fast enough. This paper asks the
question that how fast should $|\Gamma_{1,t}|$ decay in order to have a bounded
global solution? This question is of significant importance in realistic
situations, such as the temperature control within a certain safe range. By
taking advantage of the Neumann heat kernel, we conclude that a polynomial
decay $|\Gamma_{1,t}|\sim |\Gamma_1|(1+Ct)^{-\beta}$ with any $\beta>n-1$
suffices to ensure a bounded global solution.

an important topic in information retrieval (IR) research. However, this topic
has not been well-studied in the learning-to-rank setting and most of the
existing work still treats each document independently while scoring. The
recent development of deep learning shows strength in modeling complex
relationships across sequences and sets. It thus motivates us to study how to
leverage cross-document interactions for learning-to-rank in the deep learning

requirement for a scoring function that captures cross-document interactions.
We then propose a self-attention based document interaction network and show
that it satisfies the permutation-equivariant requirement, and can generate
scores for document sets of varying sizes. Our proposed methods can
automatically learn to capture document interactions without any auxiliary

non-commutative division algebra by William Rowan Hamilton in 1843. In this
article, we review the recent progress on building up the connection between
the mathematical concept of quaternoinic analyticity and the physics of
high-dimensional topological states. Three- and four-dimensional harmonic
oscillator wavefunctions are reorganized by the SU(2) Aharanov-Casher gauge
potential to yield high-dimensional Landau levels possessing the full
rotational symmetries and flat energy dispersions. The lowest Landau level
wavefunctions exhibit quaternionic analyticity, satisfying the {\it
Cauchy-Riemann-Fueter} condition, which generalizes the two-dimensional complex
analyticity to three and four dimensions. It is also the Euclidean version of
the helical Dirac and the chiral Weyl equations. After dimensional reductions,
these states become two- and three-dimensional topological states maintaining
time-reversal symmetry but exhibiting broken parity. We speculate that
quaternionic analyticity can provide a guiding principle for future researches
on high-dimensional interacting topological states. Other progresses including
high-dimensional Landau levels of Dirac fermions, their connections to high
energy physics, and high-dimensional Landau levels in the Landau-type gauges,
are also reviewed. This research is also an important application of the
mathematical subject of quaternion analysis in theoretical physics, and
provides useful guidance for the experimental explorations on novel topological
states of matter.

their linear dependence on N_{coll} in pA collisions. The results of this

50% to more than 80%, are significantly higher than those observed in Galactic
GCs with similar present-day masses. By considering both Galactic and MC
clusters, the fraction of 1G stars exhibits: (i) a strong anti-correlation with
the present-day mass, and (ii) with the present-day mass of 2G stars; (iii) a
mild anti-correlation with 1G present-day mass. All Galactic clusters without
MPs have initial masses smaller than ~1.5 10^5 solar masses but a mass
threshold governing the occurrence of MPs seems challenged by massive
simple-population MC GCs; (iv) Milky Way clusters with large perigalactic

disappears when we use initial cluster masses. These facts are consistent with
a scenario where the stars lost by GCs mostly belong to the 1G. By exploiting
recent work based on Gaia, half of the known Type II GCs appear clustered in a
distinct region of the integral of motions space, thus suggesting a common
progenitor galaxy. Except for these Type II GCs,we do not find any significant
difference in the MPs between clusters associated with different progenitors.

information loss. Calibrating the model to user responsiveness data on Twitter,
we replicate and explain several observed phenomena: 1) Responsiveness is
sensitive to information overload threshold at high rates of information loss;
2) Information overload threshold and rate of information loss are
Pareto-optimal and users may experience overload at inflows exceeding 30
notifications per hour; 3) Local abundance of small cascades of modest global
popularity and local scarcity of larger cascades of high global popularity
explains why overloaded users receive, but do not respond to large, highly
popular cascades; 4) Users typically work with 7 notifications per hour; 5)
Over-exposure to information can suppress the likelihood of response by
overloading users, contrary to analogies to biologically-inspired viral spread.

overload creates a richer representation of online conversation dynamics,

were considered; a porous tube with a closed front that prevents the bubbles
from entering the porous tube and keeps the bubbles in the annular gap; a

both in time and angle should be able to document an unusual optical effect
known as relativistic image doubling (RID). The logic of RID is that the shower
appears to precede its own Cherenkov radiation when its speed component toward
the IACT is superluminal, but appears to trail its own Cherenkov radiation when
its speed component toward the IACT is subluminal. The result is that the IACT
will see the shower start not at the top of the atmosphere but in the middle --
at the point along the shower's path where its radial velocity component drops
to subluminal. Images of the shower would then be seen by the IACT to go both
up and down simultaneously. A simple simulation demonstrating this effect is
presented. Clear identification of RID would confirm in the atmosphere a novel
optical imaging effect caused not by lenses but solely by relativistic
kinematics, and may aid in the accuracy of path and speed reconstructions of
the relativistic air shower.

their versatility in solving problems of scientific and commercial interest.
However, leading algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation, such as the Variational
Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), use fixed preconstructed ansatzes, limiting their
general applicability and accuracy. Thus, variational forms---the quantum
circuits that implement ansatzes ---are either crafted heuristically or by
encoding domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present an Evolutionary
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (EVQE), a novel variational algorithm that uses
evolutionary programming techniques to minimize the expectation value of a
given Hamiltonian by dynamically generating and optimizing an ansatz. The
algorithm is equally applicable to optimization problems in all domains,
obtaining accurate energy evaluations with hardware-efficient ansatzes. In
molecular simulations, the variational forms generated by EVQE are up to
$18.6\times$ shallower and use up to $12\times$ fewer CX gates than those
obtained by VQE with a unitary coupled cluster ansatz. EVQE demonstrates
significant noise-resistance properties, obtaining results in noisy simulation
with at least $3.6\times$ less error than VQE using any tested ansatz
configuration. We successfully evaluated EVQE on a real 5-qubit IBMQ quantum
computer. The experimental results, which we obtained both via simulation and
on real quantum hardware, demonstrate the effectiveness of EVQE for
general-purpose optimization on the quantum computers of the present and near
future.

interval centred on a bootstrap smoothed estimator, with width proportional to
an estimator of Efron's delta method approximation to the standard deviation of
this estimator. They used a testbed situation consisting of two nested linear
regression models, with error variance assumed known, and model selection using
a preliminary hypothesis test. This assessment was in terms of coverage and
scaled expected length, where the scaling is with respect to the expected
length of the usual confidence interval with the same minimum coverage
probability. They found that this confidence interval has scaled expected
length that (a) has a maximum value that may be much greater than 1 and (b) is
greater than a number slightly less than 1 when the simpler model is correct.
We therefore ask the following question. For a confidence interval, centred on
the bootstrap smoothed estimator, does there exist a formula for its data-based
width such that, in this testbed situation, it has the desired minimum coverage
and scaled expected length that (a) has a maximum value that is not too much
larger than 1 and (b) is substantially less than 1 when the simpler model is

straining the material along the zigzag direction in comparison with the

thorough investigation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic AHE in a new family
of FM WSMs, PrAlGe$_{1-x}$Si$_x$, where $x$ can be tuned continuously. From DFT
calculations, we show that the two end members, PrAlGe and PrAlSi, have
different Fermi surfaces but similar Weyl node structures. Experimentally, we
observe moderate changes in the anomalous Hall coefficient ($R_S$) but
significant changes in the ordinary Hall coefficient ($R_0$) in
PrAlGe$_{1-x}$Si$_x$ as a function of $x$, confirming a change of Fermi
surface. By comparing the magnitude of $R_0$ and $R_S$, we identify two
regimes; $|R_0|<|R_S|$ when $x\le0.5$ and $|R_0|>|R_S|$ when $x>0.5$. Through a
detailed scaling analysis, we discover a universal anomalous Hall conductivity
(AHC) from intrinsic contribution when $x\le0.5$. Such universal AHC is absent
when $x>0.5$. Thus, we point out the significance of the extrinsic mechanisms

approach to inference, and show that softening the PARAFAC increases model
flexibility, leads to improved estimation of coefficient tensors, more accurate
identification of important predictor entries, and more precise predictions,
even for a low approximation rank. From a theoretical perspective, we show that
employing Softer leads to a weakly consistent posterior distribution of the

maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) for latent variable models. However, MCML
algorithms are computationally expensive when the latent variables are
high-dimensional and correlated, as is the case for latent Gaussian random
field models. Latent Gaussian random field models are widely used, for example
in building flexible regression models and in the interpolation of spatially
dependent data in many research areas such as analyzing count data in disease
modeling and presence-absence satellite images of ice sheets. We propose a
computationally efficient MCML algorithm by using a projection-based approach
to reduce the dimensions of the random effects. We develop an iterative method
for finding an effective importance function; this is generally a challenging
problem and is crucial for the MCML algorithm to be computationally feasible.
We find that our method is applicable to both continuous (latent Gaussian
process) and discrete domain (latent Gaussian Markov random field) models. We
illustrate the application of our methods to challenging simulated and real
data examples for which maximum likelihood estimation would otherwise be very
challenging. Furthermore, we study an often overlooked challenge in MCML
approaches to latent variable models: practical issues in calculating standard

Alastair Cameron in the 1950s. Recent faculty hires have further boosted
activity in the field, including transient observation and theory, survey

wildlife population distributions. Motion-activated cameras, also known as
camera traps, are a critical tool for population surveys, as they are cheap and
non-intrusive. However, extracting useful information from camera trap images
is a cumbersome process: a typical camera trap survey may produce millions of
images that require slow, expensive manual review. Consequently, critical
information is often lost due to resource limitations, and critical
conservation questions may be answered too slowly to support decision-making.
Computer vision is poised to dramatically increase efficiency in image-based
biodiversity surveys, and recent studies have harnessed deep learning
techniques for automatic information extraction from camera trap images.
However, the accuracy of results depends on the amount, quality, and diversity
of the data available to train models, and the literature has focused on
projects with millions of relevant, labeled training images. Many camera trap
projects do not have a large set of labeled images and hence cannot benefit
from existing machine learning techniques. Furthermore, even projects that do
have labeled data from similar ecosystems have struggled to adopt deep learning
methods because image classification models overfit to specific image
backgrounds (i.e., camera locations). In this paper, we focus not on automating
the labeling of camera trap images, but on accelerating this process. We
combine the power of machine intelligence and human intelligence to build a
scalable, fast, and accurate active learning system to minimize the manual work
required to identify and count animals in camera trap images. Our proposed
scheme can match the state of the art accuracy on a 3.2 million image dataset

condition understanding classifies the scene conditions related to various
conditions about the drivers and driving situations such as statuses of wearing

projection functions in previous works cannot generalize well since they assume
the distribution consistency between seen and unseen domains at

task-level, our CPL is capable of transferring knowledge smoothly to recognize
unseen samples.Furthermore, inside each task, discriminative visual prototypes
are learned via a distance based training mechanism. Consequently, we can
perform recognition in visual space, instead of semantic space. An extensive

ionized gas, and sample selection bias. Accounting for complex density
gradients and temperature profiles is critical for reliably estimating the
fundamental properties of H ii regions and galaxies. Diffuse ionized gas can
raise metallicity estimates, flatten metallicity gradients, and introduce
scatter in ionization parameter measurements. We summarize with a discussion of
the challenges and major opportunities for emission-line diagnostics in the

from a certain distribution, Gaussian distribution, for example, has been a hot
topic for decades. Many clustering algorithms: such as k-means and spectral
clustering are proposed based on the single sample assumption. However, in real
life, each input object can usually be the multiple samples drawn from a
certain hidden distribution. The traditional clustering algorithms cannot
handle such a situation. This calls for the multiple sample clustering
algorithm. But the traditional multiple sample clustering algorithms can only
handle scalar samples or samples from Gaussian distribution. This constrains
the application field of multiple sample clustering algorithms. In this paper,
we purpose a general framework for multiple sample clustering. Various
algorithms can be generated by this framework. We apply two specific cases of
this framework: Wasserstein distance version and Bhattacharyya distance version
on both synthetic data and stock price data. The simulation results show that
the sufficient statistic can greatly improve the clustering accuracy and
stability.

a smooth crossover and the crossover point is termed a Lifshitz point. Quantum
fluctuations change the nature of the transition. In particular it has been
argued previously that in the two-dimensional (2D) case a spin liquid (SL)

In the present work, using a field theory approach, we solve the Lifshitz

we show that, unlike the SU(2) symmetric Lifshitz case, in the XY-model the SL

several solar radii in the white-light passbands, respectively. What's more, we
find that the CMEs without obvious cavity in the white-light images can also
exhibit the clear three-part appearance in the EUV images, which means that the
low-density zone in the EUV images (observed as the cavity in white-light

from the literature. Furthermore, we find weak evidence that GW170817 involved
at least one NS based on gravitational-wave data alone ($B^{NS}_{BBH}= 3.3 \pm
1.4$), consistent with the observation of electromagnetic counterparts. We also
investigate GW170817's implications for the maximum spin frequency of
millisecond pulsars, and find that the fastest known pulsar is spinning at more

modest evidence in favor of quark matter within NSs, and GW170817 favors the
presence of at least one disconnected hybrid star branch in the mass--radius
relation over a single stable branch by a factor of 2. Assuming there are
multiple stable branches, we find a suggestive posterior preference for a sharp
softening around nuclear density followed by stiffening around twice nuclear
density, consistent with a strong first-order phase transition. While the
statistical evidence in favor of new physics within NS cores remains tenuous
with GW170817 alone, these tantalizing hints reemphasize the promise of
gravitational waves for constraining the supranuclear EOS.

phase (typically associated with the coasting phase of the jet) is seen in this

challenge when training deep networks. In this paper, we describe another
phenomenon, called vanishing nodes, that also increases the difficulty of
training deep neural networks. As the depth of a neural network increases, the
network's hidden nodes have more highly correlated behavior. This results in
great similarities between these nodes. The redundancy of hidden nodes thus
increases as the network becomes deeper. We call this problem vanishing nodes,
and we propose the metric vanishing node indicator (VNI) for quantitatively
measuring the degree of vanishing nodes. The VNI can be characterized by the
network parameters, which is shown analytically to be proportional to the depth
of the network and inversely proportional to the network width. The theoretical
results show that the effective number of nodes vanishes to one when the VNI
increases to one (its maximal value), and that vanishing/exploding gradients
and vanishing nodes are two different challenges that increase the difficulty
of training deep neural networks. The numerical results from the experiments
suggest that the degree of vanishing nodes will become more evident during
back-propagation training, and that when the VNI is equal to 1, the network
cannot learn simple tasks (e.g. the XOR problem) even when the gradients are
neither vanishing nor exploding. We refer to this kind of gradients as the
walking dead gradients, which cannot help the network converge when having a
relatively large enough scale. Finally, the experiments show that the
likelihood of failed training increases as the depth of the network increases.
The training will become much more difficult due to the lack of network
representation capability.

high-resolution OCT images training on a publicly available OCT dataset
including urgent referrals (choroidal neovascularization and diabetic macular
edema) and non-urgent referrals (normal and drusen). 400 real and synthetic OCT
images were evaluated by 2 retinal specialists to assess image quality. We
further trained 2 DL models on either real or synthetic datasets and compared
the performance of urgent vs nonurgent referrals diagnosis tested on a local

synthetic OCT images was similar as assessed by 2 retinal specialists. The
accuracy of discrimination as real vs synthetic OCT images was 59.50% for
retinal specialist 1 and 53.67% for retinal specialist 2. For the local
dataset, the DL model trained on real (DL_Model_R) and synthetic OCT images

For the clinical dataset, the AUC was 0.94 for DL_Model_R, 0.90 for DL_Model_S.
Conclusions: The GAN-synthetic OCT images can be used by clinicians for
educational purposes and developing DL algorithms. Translational Relevance: The
medical image synthesis based on GANs is promising in human and machine to

pre-thermalization in $N$-component alkaline earth gases. To this end, we
compute the short-time dynamics of the instantaneous momentum distribution and
the relative population for different initial conditions after an interaction
quench, accounting for the 11 peffect of initial interactions. We find that
switching on an interaction that breaks the SU$(N)$ symmetry of the initial
Hamiltonian, thus allowing for the occurrence of spin-changing collisions, does
not necessarily lead to a suppression of pre-thermalization. However, the
suppression will be most effective in the presence of SU$(N)$-breaking
interactions provided the number of components $N \ge 4$ and the initial state
contains a population imbalance that breaks the SU$(N)$ symmetry. We also find
the conditions on the imbalance initial state that allow for a pre-thermal
state to be stabilized for a certain time. Our study highlights the important
role played by the initial state in the pre-thermalization dynamics of
multicomponent Fermi gases. It also demonstrates that alkaline-earth Fermi
gases provide an interesting playground for the study and control of
pre-thermalization.

investigates this isomorphism problem for $\mathbb{Z}$-linear quasigroups. We
consider the extent to which ordinary characters classify $\mathbb{Z}$-linear
quasigroups and their representations of the free group on two generators. We
exhibit non-isomorphic $\mathbb{Z}$-linear quasigroups with the same ordinary

the corresponding ordinary representations are realized by permutational
intertwinings. This leads to a new equivalence relation on $\mathbb{Z}$-linear
quasigroups, namely permutational similarity. Like the earlier concept of
central isotopy, permutational similarity is intermediate between isomorphism

those of Local Binary Pattern (LBP) based methods. The original method was not

the moment orders and the weights for each moment.
  We implemented the LTM method in a flexible way in order to allow for the

subsets from the Outex dataset (a popular benchmark for texture analysis), we
used Random Forests to create models and to classify texture images, recording

networks represent mappings from a set of inputs to a set of probability
distributions over the set of outputs. In particular, even if the sets of
inputs and outputs are finite, the class of stochastic mappings in question is
not finite. Moreover, while for a deterministic function the values of all
output variables can be computed independently of each other given the values
of the inputs, in the stochastic setting the values of the output variables may
need to be correlated, which requires that their values are computed jointly. A
prominent class of stochastic feedforward networks which has played a key role
in the resurgence of deep learning are deep belief networks. The
representational power of these networks has been studied mainly in the
generative setting, as models of probability distributions without an input, or
in the discriminative setting for the special case of deterministic mappings.

compositions of linear transformations of probability distributions, Markov

recording its observed behavior, the problem of business process conformance
checking is that of identifying and describing the differences between the
model and the log. A desirable feature of a conformance checking technique is
to identify a minimal yet complete set of differences. Existing conformance
checking techniques that fulfil this property exhibit limited scalability when
confronted to large and complex models and logs. This paper presents two
complementary techniques to address these shortcomings. The first technique
transforms the model and log into two automata. These automata are compared
using an error-correcting synchronized product, computed via an A* that
guarantees the resulting automaton captures all differences with a minimal
amount of error corrections. The synchronized product is used to extract
minimal-length alignments between each trace of the log and the closest
corresponding trace of the model. A limitation of the first technique is that
as the level of concurrency in the model increases, the size of the automaton
of the model grows exponentially, thus hampering scalability. To address this
limitation, the paper proposes a second technique wherein the process model is
first decomposed into a set of automata, known as S-components, such that the
product of these automata is equal to the automaton of the whole process model.
An error-correcting product is computed for each S-component separately and the
resulting automata are recomposed into a single product automaton capturing all
differences without minimality guarantees. An empirical evaluation shows that
the proposed techniques outperform state-of-the-art baselines in terms of
computational efficiency. Moreover, the decomposition-based technique is
optimal for the vast majority of datasets and quasi-optimal for the remaining
ones.

investigate this problem by formulating face images as points in a
shape-appearance parameter space, and our results demonstrate that: (i) The
encoding and decoding of the neuron responses (representations) to face images
in CNNs could be achieved under a linear model in the parameter space, in
agreement with the recent discovery in primate IT face neurons, but different
from the aforementioned perspective on CNNs' face representation with complex
image feature encoding; (ii) The linear model for face encoding and decoding in
the parameter space could achieve close or even better performances on face
recognition and verification than state-of-the-art CNNs, which might provide
new lights on the design strategies for face recognition systems; (iii) The

the interior of elements inside the subdomains, and piecewise polynomials of
degree $ k$ for the numerical traces of potential on the inter-element

interface inside elements are adopted to deal with the jump condition. The
second X-HDG method is a modified version of the first one and applies to any

with equivalent subjective quality as compared to its predecessor H.264/AVC.
The significant coding efficiency improvement is attributed to many new
techniques. Inter-frame coding is one of the most powerful yet complicated
techniques therein and has posed high computational burden thus main obstacle
in HEVC-based real-time applications. Recently, plenty of research has been
done to optimize the inter-frame coding, either to reduce the complexity for
real-time applications, or to further enhance the encoding efficiency. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art techniques for
HEVC inter-frame coding from three aspects, namely fast inter coding solutions,
implementation on different hardware platforms as well as advanced inter coding
techniques. More specifically, different algorithms in each aspect are further
subdivided into sub-categories and compared in terms of pros, cons, coding
efficiency and coding complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first such comprehensive review of the recent advances of the inter-frame
coding for HEVC and hopefully it would help the improvement, implementation and
applications of HEVC as well as the ongoing development of the next generation
video coding standard.

the momentum transfer at the tree level, and loop diagrams give the leading
contribution to it. The model prediction of $\sigma_\text{SI}$ highly depends
on values of $c_1$ and $c_2$ that are the quartic couplings between the gauge
singlet CP-odd state ($a_0$) and Higgs doublet fields ($H_1$ and $H_2$), $c_1
a_0^2 H_1^\dagger H_1$ and $c_2 a_0^2 H_2^\dagger H_2$. We discuss the upper
and lower bounds on $c_1$ and $c_2$ by studying the stability of the
electroweak vacuum, the condition for the potential bounded from the below, and
the perturbative unitarity. We find that the condition for the stability of the
electroweak vacuum gives upper bounds on $c_1$ and $c_2$. The condition for the
potential to be bounded from below gives lower bounds on $c_1$ and $c_2$. It
also constrains the mixing angle between the two CP-odd states. The
perturbative unitarity bound gives the upper bound on the Yukawa coupling
between the dark matter and $a_0$ and the quartic coupling of $a_0$. Under
these theoretical constraints, we find that the maximum value of the
$\sigma_\text{SI}$ is $\sim 5\times 10^{-47}$ cm$^2$ for $m_A = $ 600 GeV, and
the LZ and XENONnT experiments can see the DM signal predicted in this model
near future.

excitation of electron-hole pairs, stand at the frontier of the studies of
gas-surface reaction dynamics. However, the first principles description of
electronic excitation remains challenging. In an efficient molecular dynamics
with electronic friction (MDEF) method, the nonadiabatic couplings are
effectively included in a so-called electronic friction tensor (EFT), which can
be computed from first-order time-dependent perturbation theory (TDPT) in terms
of density functional theory (DFT) orbitals. This second-rank tensor depends on
adsorbate position and features a complicated transformation with regard to the
intrinsic symmetry operations of the system. In this work, we develop a new
symmetry-adapted neural network representation of EFT, based on our recently
proposed embedded atom neural network (EANN) framework. Inspired by the
derivation of the nonadiabatic coupling matrix, we represent the tensorial
friction by the first and second derivatives of multiple outputs of NNs with
respect to atomic Cartesian coordinates. This rigorously preserves the positive
semidefiniteness, directional property, and correct symmetry-equivariance of
EFT. Unlike previous methods, our new approach can readily include both
molecular and surface degrees of freedom, regardless of the type of surface.
Tests on the H2+Ag(111) system show that this approach yields an accurate,
efficient, and continuous representation of EFT, making it possible to perform
large scale TDPT-based MDEF simulations to study both adiabatic and
nonadiabatic energy dissipation in a unified framework.

In particular, starting from a model trained with inaccurate annotations as

reliable pseudo-masks by iteratively aggregating the current learned model with
the former optimal one in an online manner. Besides, those correspondingly
corrected labels can in turn to further boost the model performance. In this
way, the models and the labels will reciprocally become more robust and

by a factor of two the sensitivity to anomalous couplings of the HL-LHC. For

we propose an optical full differentiator based on the spin-orbit interaction
of light at a simple optical interface. The broadband optical operation is
independent on the wavelength due to the nature of purely geometric. As an
important application of the fully differential operation, the broadband image
processing of edge detection is demonstrated. By adjusting the polarization of
the incident beam, the one-dimension edge imaging at any desirable direction
can be obtained. The broadband image processing of edge detection provides
possible applications in autonomous driving, target recognition, microscopic

distributed, the problem of computing the distribution function $\Pr[X_{\rm

this case, $\Pr[X_{\rm MAX}\le x]$ is equal to the volume of the knapsack

treewidth of $G$ is at most a constant $k$. The running time of our algorithm
is $O(k^2 n(\frac{16(k+1)mn^2}{\epsilon})^{4k^2+6k+2})$ to achieve a
multiplicative approximation ratio $1+\epsilon$. Before our FPTAS, we present a
fundamental formula that represents $\Pr[X_{\rm MAX}\le x]$ by at most $n-1$

the mutually independent standard exponential distribution, we show a

periodic convergecast applications in wireless sensor networks. We
experimentally observe that if two nodes transmit same number of data packets,
the amount of energy consumption of the nodes is approximately the same even if
the payload lengths of the transmitted packets are different. This is because
the major energy consumption during a packet transmission arises from radio
start-up and medium access control overhead. Our formulated lifetime
maximization problem captures the energy expenditure due to message
transmissions/ receptions in terms of the number of data packets transmitted/
received, in contrast to prior works, which consider the number of data units

transmission power levels of the radio and accounting for the sensor energy
consumption are other factors that make our problem formulation different from
those in prior work. We prove that this problem is NP-complete and propose an

experimentally evaluated using Jain's fairness index as a metric by
implementing it on an actual testbed consisting of 20 sensor nodes and compared

we set up an infrared high resolution spectrometer in our laboratory and used
this instrument to characterize the modal noise generated in fibers of

conventional scrambling systems for fibers: a mechanical agitator and an
optical double scrambler. We find that the strength of the modal noise
primarily depends on how the fiber is illuminated. It dramatically increases
when the fiber is under-illuminated, either in the near field or in the far
field. The modal noise is similar in circular and octagonal fibers. The Fourier
spectrum of the noise decreases exponentially with frequency; i.e., the modal
noise is not white but favors broad spectral features. Using the optical double
scrambler has no effect on modal noise. The mechanical agitator has effects
that vary between different types of fibers and input illuminations. In some
cases this agitator has virtually no effect. In other cases, it mitigates the
modal noise, but flattens the noise spectrum in Fourier space; i.e., the
mechanical agitator preferentially filters the broad spectral features. Our
results show that modal noise is frustratingly insensitive to the use of
octagonal fibers and optical double scramblers; i.e., the conventional systems
used to improve the performances of spectrographs fed via unevenly illuminated
fibers. Fiber agitation may help in some cases, but its effect has to be
verified on a case-by-case basis. More generally, our results indicate that the
design of the fiber link feeding a spectrograph should be coupled with
laboratory measurements that reproduce, as closely as possible, the conditions

intractable for low-power mobile nodes and remote security applications. To
address this challenge, this paper proposes a low-power (5W) end-to-end
neuromorphic framework for object tracking and classification using event-based
cameras that possess desirable properties such as low power consumption (5-14
mW) and high dynamic range (120 dB). Nonetheless, unlike traditional approaches
of using event-by-event processing, this work uses a mixed frame and event
approach to get energy savings with high performance. Using a frame-based
region proposal method based on the density of foreground events, a
hardware-friendly object tracking is implemented using the apparent object
velocity while tackling occlusion scenarios. For low-power classification of
the tracked objects, the event camera is interfaced to IBM TrueNorth, which is
time-multiplexed to tackle up to eight instances for a traffic monitoring
application. The frame-based object track input is converted back to spikes for
Truenorth classification via the energy efficient deep network (EEDN) pipeline.
Using originally collected datasets, we train the TrueNorth model on the
hardware track outputs, instead of using ground truth object locations as
commonly done, and demonstrate the efficacy of our system to handle practical
surveillance scenarios. Finally, we compare the proposed methodologies to
state-of-the-art event-based systems for object tracking and classification,
and demonstrate the use case of our neuromorphic approach for low-power
applications without sacrificing on performance.

an intermediate mass central binary whose separation is of the order of a few
tens of the radii of the individual components, and an M-star companion at
about 30 au. Our aim is to understand the nature of the extended structure by
means of combining integral-field and high-resolution spectroscopy. We
conducted the analysis based on FEROS archival optical spectroscopy data and
adaptive optics images and integral-field spectra obtained with SINFONI and
SPHERE at the VLT. The observations reveal a complex extended structure that is
composed of at least two components: a non-uniform wide cavity whose walls are
detected in continuum emission up to 400~au, and a collimated wiggling-jet
detected in the emission lines of Helium and Hydrogen. Moreover, the presence
of [FeII] emission projected close to the cavity walls suggests the presence of
a slower moving wind, most likely a disk wind. The multiple components of the
optical forbidden lines also indicate the presence of a high-velocity jet
co-existing with a slow wind. We constructed a geometrical model of the
collimated jet flowing within the cavity using intensity and velocity maps,
finding that its wiggling is consistent with the orbital period of the central
binary. The cavity and the jet do not share the same position angle, suggesting
that the jet is itself experiencing a precession motion possibly due to the
wide M-dwarf companion. We propose a scenario that closely agrees with the
general expectation of a magneto-centrifugal-launched jet. These results build
upon the extensive studies already conducted on RCrA.

present-day stellar abundances. Previous techniques have treated each abundance
dimension as being statistically independent, despite theoretical expectations
that many elements can be produced by more than one nucleosynthetic process. In
this work we introduce a data-driven model of nucleosynthesis where a set of
latent factors (e.g., nucleosynthetic yields) contribute to all stars with
different scores, and clustering (e.g., chemical tagging) is modelled by a
mixture of multivariate Gaussians in a lower-dimensional latent space. We use
an exact method to simultaneously estimate the factor scores for each star, the
partial assignment of each star to each cluster, and the latent factors common
to all stars, even in the presence of missing data entries. We use an
information-theoretic Bayesian principle to estimate the number of latent
factors and clusters. Using the second Galah data release we find that six
latent factors are preferred to explain N = 2,566 stars with 17 chemical
abundances. We identify the rapid- and slow-neutron capture processes, as well
as latent factors consistent with Fe-peak and \alpha-element production, and
another where K and Zn dominate. When we consider N ~ 160,000 stars with
missing abundances we find another 7 factors, as well as 16 components in
latent space. Despite these components showing separation in chemistry that is
explained through different yield contributions, none show significant
structure in their positions or motions. We argue that more data, and joint
priors on cluster membership that are constrained by dynamical models, are
necessary to realise chemical tagging at a galactic-scale. We release software
that allows for model parameters to be optimised in seconds given a fixed
number of latent factors, components, and $10^7$ abundance measurements.

operation that models a notion of computability. This paper studies a
generalization of PCAs, introduced by W. Stekelenburg, where a PCA is not a set

categories of assemblies is closed both under taking small products and under
slicing, which is to be contrasted with the situation for ordinary PCAs. We
describe these two constructions explicitly at the level of PCAs, allowing us
to compute a number of examples of products and slices of PCAs. Moreover, we
show how PCAs can be transported along regular functors, enabling us to compare
PCAs constructed over different base categories. Via a Grothendieck
construction, this leads to a (2-)category whose objects are PCAs and whose
arrows are generalized applicative morphisms. This category has small products,
which correspond to the small products of categories of assemblies, and it has
finite coproducts in a weak sense. Finally, we give a criterion when a functor
between categories of assemblies that is induced by an applicative morphism has
a right adjoint, by generalizing the notion of computational density introduced

space thus limiting the attack ability and transferability especially for

concepts of structure patterns and structure-aware perturbations that relax the

of our approach is to allow perceptible deviation in adversarial examples while
keeping structure patterns that are central to a human classifier. Built upon
these concepts, we propose a \emph{structure-preserving attack (SPA)} for
generating natural adversarial examples with extremely high transferability.
Empirical results on the MNIST and the CIFAR10 datasets show that SPA exhibits
strong attack ability in both the white-box and black-box setting even defenses
are applied. Moreover, with the integration of PGD or CW attack, its attack
ability escalates sharply under the white-box setting, without losing the
outstanding transferability inherited from SPA.

recently refuted this conjecture by proving the existence of maximally
nonassociative quasigroups for a certain infinite set of orders $|Q|$. In this

on quadratic character sums. Unlike in the previous work, our results are to a

Re-ID in dark environments. Existing researches mainly focus on enlarging
inter-class differences of feature to solve the problem. However, few studies
investigate improving intra-class cross-modality similarity, which is important
for this issue. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function, called
Hetero-Center loss (HC loss) to reduce the intra-class cross-modality

cross-modality invariant information by constraining the intra-class center
distance between two heterogenous modalities. With the joint supervision of
Cross-Entropy (CE) loss and HC loss, the network is trained to achieve two
vital objectives, inter-class discrepancy and intra-class cross-modality
similarity as much as possible. Besides, we propose a simple and
high-performance network architecture to learn local feature representations

the liquid ordered phase of a 2:1 binary mixture of Sphingomyelin and

it is found that DiD can be used to identify the lipid bilayer phase. The joint

investment game between one reinsurer and two insurers, including a stochastic
Stackelberg differential subgame and a non-zero-sum stochastic differential
subgame. The reinsurer, as the leader of the Stackelberg game, can price
reinsurance premium and invest its wealth in a financial market that contains a
risk-free asset and a risky asset. The two insurers, as the followers of the
Stackelberg game, can purchase proportional reinsurance from the reinsurer and
invest in the same financial market. The competitive relationship between two
insurers is modeled by the non-zero-sum game, and their decision making will
consider the relative performance measured by the difference in their terminal
wealth. We consider wealth processes with delay to characterize the bounded
memory feature. This paper aims to find the equilibrium strategy for the
reinsurer and insurers by maximizing the expected utility of the reinsurer's
terminal wealth with delay and maximizing the expected utility of the
combination of insurers' terminal wealth and the relative performance with
delay. By using the idea of backward induction and the dynamic programming
approach, we derive the equilibrium strategy and value functions explicitly.
Then, we provide the corresponding verification theorem. Finally, some
numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are presented to demonstrate the
effects of model parameters on the equilibrium strategy. We find the delay
factor discourages or stimulates investment depending on the length of delay.
Moreover, competitive factors between two insurers make their optimal
reinsurance-investment strategy interact, and reduce reinsurance demand and
reinsurance premium price.

when interfaces are formed, charge transfer (CT) processes can occur, in which

These processes are accessible by modelling and computational analysis. Yet,
the presence of different environments can strongly affect the outcome of such

luminous objects as tools to study the environments of intervening or host
galaxy absorption systems through cosmic time. Part I is dedicated to examining
the gas, dust and metals in the immediate region surrounding GRBs. Part II
presents a search for and the study of cold and molecular gas in high-z GRB
host galaxy absorption systems. Part III focuses on using quasars to examine
gas-rich intervening galaxies in the line of sight, with specific focus on
absorption systems rich in dust and metals. This thesis demonstrates the
importance of observing large samples of GRB afterglows to 1) allow for
statistical studies of the GRB phenomena itself and the associated host galaxy
environments and 2) to obtain spectra of peculiar or unusual GRB afterglows,

solve the existing cosmological tensions. The properties we consider in
combination are an interaction between the dark matter and dark energy
components, and a dark energy equation of state $w$ different from that of the
canonical cosmological constant $w=-1$. In principle, these two parameters are
independent. In practice, to avoid early-time, superhorizon instabilities,
their allowed parameter spaces are correlated. We analyze three classes of
extended interacting dark energy models in light of the 2019 Planck CMB results
and Cepheid-calibrated local distance ladder $H_0$ measurements of Riess et al.
(R19), as well as recent BAO and SNeIa distance data. We find that in
quintessence coupled dark energy models, where $w > -1$, the evidence for a
non-zero coupling between the two dark sectors can surpass the $5\sigma$
significance. On the other hand, in phantom coupled dark energy models, there
is no such preference for a non-zero dark sector coupling. All the models we
consider significantly raise the value of the Hubble constant easing the $H_0$
tension. The addition of low-redshift BAO and SNeIa measurements leaves some
residual tension with R19 but at a level that could be justified by a
statistical fluctuation. Bayesian evidence considerations mildly disfavour both
the coupled quintessence and phantom models, while mildly favouring a coupled
vacuum scenario, even when late-time datasets are considered. We conclude that
non-minimal dark energy cosmologies, such as coupled quintessence, phantom, or
vacuum models, are still an interesting route towards softening existing
cosmological tensions, even when low-redshift datasets and Bayesian evidence

momentum and chemical elements in stellar radiative zones. In the past two
decades, an emphasis has been placed on the turbulent transport induced by the
vertical shear instability. However, instabilities arising from horizontal
shear and the strength of the anisotropic turbulent transport that they may
trigger remain relatively unexplored. This paper investigates the combined
effects of stable stratification, rotation, and thermal diffusion on the
horizontal shear instabilities in the context of stellar radiative zones. The
eigenvalue problem describing linear instabilities of a flow with a
hyperbolic-tangent horizontal shear profile was solved numerically for a wide
range of parameters. As a first step, we consider a polar $f$-plane where the
gravity and rotation vector are aligned. Two types of instabilities are
identified: the inflectional and inertial instabilities. The inflectional
instability that arises from the inflection point is the most unstable when at
a zero vertical wavenumber and a finite wavenumber in the streamwise direction
along the imposed-flow direction. The three-dimensional inflectional
instability is destabilized by stratification, while it is stabilized by
thermal diffusion. The inertial instability is rotationally driven, and a WKBJ
analysis reveals that its growth rate reaches the maximum $\sqrt{f(1-f)}$ in
the inviscid limit as the vertical wavenumber goes to infinity, where $f$ is
the dimensionless Coriolis parameter. The inertial instability for a finite
vertical wavenumber is stabilized as the stratification increases, whereas it
is destabilized by the thermal diffusion. Furthermore, we found a
self-similarity in both the inflectional and inertial instabilities based on
the rescaled parameter $PeN^2$ with the P\'{e}clet number $Pe$ and the

unique observations of a cluster of drift pair bursts in the frequency range of

have allowed us for the first time to resolve the temporal and frequency
evolution of the source locations and sizes at a fixed frequency and along the
drifting pair components. Sources of two components of a drift pair have been
imaged and found to propagate in the same direction along nearly the same
trajectories. Motion of the second component source is delayed in time with
respect to that of the first one. The source trajectories can be complicated
and non-radial; positive and negative frequency drifts correspond to opposite
propagation directions. The drift pair bursts with positive and negative
frequency drifts, as well as the associated broadband type-III-like bursts, are
produced in the same regions. The visible source velocities are variable from
zero to a few $10^4$ (up to ${\sim 10^5}$) km/s, which often exceeds the
velocities inferred from the drift rate ($\sim 10^4$ km/s). The visible source
sizes are of about $10'-18'$; they are more compact than typical type III
sources at the same frequencies. The existing models of drift pair bursts

electronic structure of topological materials and often the resulting datasets
cannot be described by the well-known Drude model due to large, non-parabolic
contributions. In this work, we focus on the effects of magnetic fields on
topological materials through a Zeeman term included in the model Hamiltonian.
To this end, we re-evaluate the simplifications made in the derivations of the
Drude model and pinpoint the scattering time and Fermi velocity as Zeeman-term
dependent factors in the conductivity tensor. The driving mechanisms here are
the aligment of spins along the magnetic field direction, which allows for
backscattering, and a significant change to the Fermi velocity by the opening
of a hybridization gap. After considering 2D and 3D Dirac states, as well as 2D
Rashba surface states and the quasi-2D bulk states of 3D topological
insulators, we find that the 2D Dirac states on the surfaces of 3D topological
insulators produce magnetoresistance, that is significant enough to be
noticable in experiments. As this magnetoresistance effect is strongly
dependent on the spin-orbit energy, it can be used as a telltale sign of a
Fermi energy located close to the Dirac point.

nearby stars has been one of the significant developments in modern astronomy.
More than a dozen such planets, like Proxima Centauri b and TRAPPIST-1 e, are
in close-in configurations and their proximity to the host star makes them
highly sensitive to stellar activity. Episodic events such as flares have the
potential to cause severe damage to close-in planets, adversely impacting their
habitability. Flares on fast rotating young M stars occur up to 100 times more
frequently than on G-type stars which makes their planets even more susceptible
to stellar activity. Stellar Energetic Particles (SEPs) emanating from Stellar
Proton Events (SPEs) cause atmospheric damage (erosion and photochemical
changes), and produce secondary particles, which in turn results in enhanced
radiation dosage on planetary surfaces. We explore the role of SPEs and
planetary factors in determining planetary surface radiation doses. These
factors include SPE fluence and spectra, and planetary column density and
magnetic field strength. Taking particle spectra from 70 major solar events
(observed between 1956 and 2012) as proxy, we use the GEANT4 Monte Carlo model

surface radiation dose. We demonstrate that in addition to fluence, SPE
spectrum is also a crucial factor in determining the surface radiation dose. We
discuss the implications of these findings in constraining the habitability of

Our results indicate that the star has likely evolved as a slow rotator (slower
than 85\% of the stars with similar masses), corresponding to a high-energy
emission at 150 Myr of between 1-10 times that of the current Sun. We also
constrain the initial atmospheric mass fractions for the planets, obtaining a
lower limit of 4.1% for planet c, a range of 3.7-5.3% for planet d, a range of

plasmons, play an important role in the properties of materials, and have
generated the field of plasmonics. We report the observation of a highly
unusual plasmon mode on the surface of Van der Waals heterostructures of
graphene monolayer on 2D transition metal dichalcogenide substrate. Since the
exponentially decaying fields of surface plasmon wave propagating along
interface is highly sensitive to the ambient refractive index variations, such
heterostructures are useful for ultra-sensitive bio-sensing.

the next-generation wireless networks. In order to improve the security of
computation tasks offloading and enhance user connectivity, physical layer
security and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are studied in MEC-aware
networks. The secrecy outage probability is adopted to measure the secrecy
performance of computation offloading by considering a practically passive
eavesdropping scenario. The weighted sum-energy consumption minimization
problem is firstly investigated subject to the secrecy offloading rate
constraints, the computation latency constraints and the secrecy outage
probability constraints. The semi-closed form expression for the optimal
solution is derived. We then investigate the secrecy outage probability
minimization problem by taking the priority of two users into account, and
characterize the optimal secrecy offloading rates and power allocations with
closed-form expressions. Numerical results demonstrate that the performance of
our proposed design are better than those of the alternative benchmark schemes.

on the surface of a pitching and deforming hydrofoil from measurements of the
three dimensional flow field. Period-averaged stress maps are obtained both in
the presence and absence of steady flow around the foil. The velocity vector
field is determined via volumetric three-component particle tracking
velocimetry and subsequently inserted into the Navier-Stokes equation to
calculate the total hydrodynamic stress tensor. In addition, we also present a
careful error analysis of such measurements, showing that local evaluations of
stress distributions are possible. The flapping foil used in the experiments is
designed to allow comparison with a small trapezoidal fish fin, in terms of the
scaling laws that govern the oscillatory flow regime. Unsteady Euler-Bernoulli
beam theory is employed to derive instantaneous transversal force distributions
on the deflecting hydrofoil from its deflection and thereby validate the
spatial distributions of hydrodynamic stresses obtained from the fluid velocity
field. The consistency of the force time-dependence is verified using a control
volume analysis.

reaction rates in large-scale reaction networks for heavy-element
nucleosynthesis. A basic ingredient of such a calculation is the a-nucleus
optical model potential. Several different parameter sets are available in
literature, but their predictions of a-induced reaction rates vary widely,
sometimes even exceeding one order of magnitude.
  This paper presents the result of a-induced reaction cross-section
measurements on gold which could be carried out for the first time very close
to the astrophysically relevant energy region. The new experimental data are
used to test statistical model predictions and to constrain the a-nucleus
optical model potential.
  For the measurements the activation technique was used. The cross section of
the (a,n) and (a,2n) reactions was determined from g-ray counting, while that
of the radiative capture was determined via X-ray counting.
  The cross section of the reactions was measured below E$_a=20.0$~MeV. In the
case of the $^{197}$Au(a,2n)$^{199}$Tl reaction down to 17.5~MeV with 0.5-MeV
steps, reaching closer to the reaction threshold than ever before. The cross
section of $^{197}$Au(a,n)$^{200}$Tl and $^{197}$Au(a,g)$^{201}$Tl was measured
down to E$_a=13.6$ and 14.0~MeV, respectively, with 0.5-MeV steps above the
(a,2n) reaction threshold and with 1.0-MeV steps below that.
  The new dataset is in agreement with the available values from the
literature, but is more precise and extends towards lower energies. Two orders
of magnitude lower cross sections were successfully measured than in previous
experiments which used g-ray counting only, thus providing experimental data at
lower energies than ever before. The new precision dataset allows us to find
the best-fit a-nucleus optical model potential and to predict cross sections in
the Gamow window with smaller uncertainties.

the transverse momentum transfer by unit length, of charm quarks are modified
if the QGP is not in complete thermal equilibrium using the dynamical
quasi-particle model (DQPM) which reproduces both, the equation-of-state of the
QGP and the spatial diffusion coefficient of heavy quarks as predicted by
lattice QCD calculations. We study three cases: a) the QGP has an anisotropic
momentum distribution of the partons which leads to an anisotropic pressure b)
the QGP partons have higher or lower kinetic energies as compared to the
thermal expectation value, and c) the QGP partons have larger or smaller pole
masses of their spectral function as compared to the pole mass from the DQPM at
the QGP temperature. In the last two cases we adjust the number density of
partons to obtain the same energy density as in an equilibrated QGP. In the
first scenario we find that if the transverse pressure exceeds the longitudinal
one for small heavy quark momenta $A$ becomes larger and $\hat{q}$ smaller as
compared to an isotropic pressure. For heavy quarks with large momentum both,
$A$ and $\hat{q}$ , approach unity. If the partons have less kinetic energy or
a smaller pole mass as compared to a system in equilibrium charm quarks lose
more energy. In the former case $\hat{q}$ decreases whereas in the latter case
it increases for charm quark with a low or intermediate transverse momentum.
Thus each non-equilibrium scenario affects $A$ and $\hat{q}$ of charm quarks in
a different way. The modifications in our scenarios are of the order 20-50\% at
temperatures relevant for heavy ion reactions. These modifications have to be
considered if one wants to determine these coefficients by comparing heavy ion
data with theoretical predictions from viscous hydrodynamics or Langevin
equations.

gradients to backpropagate more easily through depth or time. However, their
saturation property introduces problems of its own. For example, in recurrent
models these gates need to have outputs near 1 to propagate information over
long time-delays, which requires them to operate in their saturation regime and
hinders gradient-based learning of the gate mechanism. We address this problem
by deriving two synergistic modifications to the standard gating mechanism that
are easy to implement, introduce no additional hyperparameters, and improve
learnability of the gates when they are close to saturation. We show how these
changes are related to and improve on alternative recently proposed gating
mechanisms such as chrono initialization and Ordered Neurons. Empirically, our
simple gating mechanisms robustly improve the performance of recurrent models
on a range of applications, including synthetic memorization tasks, sequential
image classification, language modeling, and reinforcement learning,
particularly when long-term dependencies are involved.

1 kpc. Aims. Our aim is the derivation of the cluster's metallicity, together

  Methods. Given its compactness, Terzan 9 was observed using the Multi Unit
Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope. The extraction of
spectra from several hundreds of individual stars allowed us to derive their
radial velocities, metallicities, and [Mg/Fe]. The spectra obtained with MUSE
were analysed through full spectrum fitting using the ETOILE code.
  Results. We obtained a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] -1.10 0.15, a heliocentric
radial velocity of vhr = 58.1 1.1 km/s , and a magnesium-to-iron [Mg/Fe] = 0.27

trust score influence on participant behavior. We study the influence of
showing a partner trust score and/or ID on participants' behavior in a

show that trust score availability has the same effect as an ID to improve
cooperation as measured by sending behavior and receiver response. Excellent

participant sensitivity to the provision of partner information. Models based

is that the dual of an algebraic quantum groupoid, admits a dual of the same
type. In the paper 'On duality of algebraic quantum groupoids' (by TT), a
result of the same nature is obtained for regular multiplier Hopf algebroids
with a single faithful integral. The duality of regular weak multiplier Hopf
algebras with a single integral can be obtained from the duality of regular
multiplier Hopf algebroids. That is however not the obvious way to obtain this
result. It is more difficult and less natural than the direct way. We will
discuss this statement further in the paper. Nevertheless, it is interesting to
investigate the relation between the two approaches to duality in greater
detail. This is what we do in this paper. We build further on the intimate

of dual pairs. It is in fact more general than the duality of these objects

complex analysis, its use has been restricted to two dimensions (2D). We first
explain its loss of accuracy as panels become curved, using a classical complex
approximation result of Walsh that can be interpreted as ""electrostatic

target singularity for one at its complexified parameter preimage; in the
latter space the panel is flat, hence the convergence rate can be much higher.
The preimage is found robustly by Newton iteration. This idea also enables, for
the first time, a near-singular quadrature for potentials generated by smooth
curves in 3D, building on recurrences of Tornberg-Gustavsson. We apply this to
accurate evaluation of the Stokes flow near to a curved filament in the slender

objective function is in terms of the expectation of a (possibly non-convex)
cost function that is parametrized by a random variable. While the convergence
speed is critical for many emerging applications, most existing stochastic
optimization methods suffer from slow convergence. Furthermore, the emerging
technology of parallel computing has motivated an increasing demand for
designing new stochastic optimization schemes that can handle parallel
optimization for implementation in distributed systems. We propose a fast
parallel stochastic optimization framework that can solve a large class of
possibly non-convex stochastic optimization problems that may arise in
applications with multi-agent systems. In the proposed method, each agent
updates its control variable in parallel, by solving a convex quadratic
subproblem independently. The convergence of the proposed method to the optimal
solution for convex problems and to a stationary point for general non-convex
problems is established. The proposed algorithm can be applied to solve a large
class of optimization problems arising in important applications from various
fields, such as machine learning and wireless networks. As a representative
application of our proposed stochastic optimization framework, we focus on
large-scale support vector machines and demonstrate how our algorithm can
efficiently solve this problem, especially in modern applications with huge

(In,Ga)As/GaAs quantum dots, which allowed us to study subtle effects of the
noise signal formation. Detecting the scattered light outside of the aperture
of the transmitted light, we measured the basic electron spin properties, like
g-factor and spin dephasing time. Further, we investigated the influence of the
microcavity on the scattering distribution and possibilities of signal
amplification by additional resonant excitation.

  scenes: A new eye-movement corpus","29 pages, 6 figures",,"10.1167/jov.20.7.8",,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When studying how people search for objects in scenes, the inhomogeneity of
the visual field is often ignored. Due to physiological limitations peripheral
vision is blurred and mainly uses coarse-grained information (i.e., low spatial
frequencies) for selecting saccade targets, whereas high-acuity central vision
uses fine-grained information (i.e., high spatial frequencies) for analysis of
details. Here we investigated how spatial frequencies and color affect object
search in real-world scenes. Using gaze-contingent filters we attenuated high
or low frequencies in central or peripheral vision while viewers searched color
or grayscale scenes. Results showed that peripheral filters and central
high-pass filters hardly affected search accuracy, whereas accuracy dropped
drastically with central low-pass filters. Peripheral filtering increased the
time to localize the target by decreasing saccade amplitudes and increasing
number and duration of fixations. The use of coarse-grained information in the
periphery was limited to color scenes. Central filtering increased the time to
verify target identity instead, especially with low-pass filters. We conclude
that peripheral vision is critical for object localization and central vision
is critical for object identification. Visual guidance during peripheral object
localization is dominated by low-frequency color information, whereas
high-frequency information, relatively independent of color, is most important
for object identification in central vision.

genetic evidence for the existence of the direct homologous dsDNA-dsDNA

dsDNA segments are matched as arrays of interspersed base-pair triplets. This

the stellar surface, it should brake down to match the rotation of the NS,
forming a boundary layer. As the mechanisms potentially responsible for this
braking are apparently inefficient, it is reasonable to consider this layer as
a spreading layer (SL) with negligible radial extent and structure. We perform
hydrodynamical 2D spectral simulations of an SL, considering the disc as a
source of matter and angular momentum. Interaction of new, rapidly rotating
matter with the pre-existing, relatively slow material co-rotating with the
star leads to instabilities capable of transferring angular momentum and
creating variability on dynamical timescales. For small accretion rates, we
find that the SL is unstable for heating instability that disrupts the initial
latitudinal symmetry and produces large deviations between the two hemispheres.
This instability also results in breaking of the axial symmetry as coherent
flow structures are formed and escape from the SL intermittently. At enhanced
accretion rates, the SL is prone to shearing instability and acts as a source
of oblique waves that propagate towards the poles, leading to patterns that
again break the axial symmetry. We compute artificial light curves of an SL
viewed at different inclination angles. Most of the simulated light curves show
oscillations at frequencies close to 1kHz. We interpret these oscillations as
inertial modes excited by shear instabilities near the boundary of the SL.
Their frequencies, dependence on flux, and amplitude variations can explain the
high-frequency pair quasi-periodic oscillations observed in many low-mass X-ray
binaries.

conditions with a unified method that can be easily used for practice. What has
been achieved to-date is rather sectorial models that address limited number of

Nonetheless, weather and visual conditions are often addressed individually. In
this paper, we introduce a novel framework to automatically extract this
information from street-level images relying on deep learning and computer
vision using a unified method without any pre-defined constraints in the
processed images. A pipeline of four deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

using ResNet50 architecture, to extract various weather and visual conditions
such as Dawn/dusk, day and night for time detection, and glare for lighting
conditions, and clear, rainy, snowy, and foggy for weather conditions. The
WeatherNet shows strong performance in extracting this information from
user-defined images or video streams that can be used not limited to:
autonomous vehicles and drive-assistance systems, tracking behaviours,
safety-related research, or even for better understanding cities through images

constraints,~i.e. increasing the number of training data, successive 2nd order
glass transition (random inputs/outputs) or 2nd order crystalline transition
(teacher-student setting) take place layer-by-layer starting next to the
inputs/outputs boundaries going deeper into the bulk with the thickness of the
solid phase growing logarithmically with the data size. This implies the
typical storage capacity of the network grows exponentially fast with the
depth. In a deep enough network, the central part remains in the liquid phase.
We argue that in systems of finite width N, the weak bias field can remain in
the center and plays the role of a symmetry-breaking field that connects the
opposite sides of the system. The successive glass transitions bring about a
hierarchical free-energy landscape with ultrametricity, which evolves in space:
it is most complex close to the boundaries but becomes renormalized into
progressively simpler ones in deeper layers. These observations provide clues
to understand why deep neural networks operate efficiently. Finally, we present
some numerical simulations of learning which reveal spatially heterogeneous
glassy dynamics truncated by a finite width $N$ effect.

health, particularly for ethnic minority and low socioeconomic groups. At the
same time, research suggests parks are underutilised by these groups. In order
to design effective interventions to promote health, the determinants of park
use for these groups must be understood. This study examines the associations
between park features, park satisfaction and park use in a deprived and
ethnically diverse sample in Bradford, UK. 652 women from the Born in Bradford
cohort completed a survey on park satisfaction and park use. Using a
standardised direct observation tool, 44 parks in the area were audited for
present park features. Features assessed were: access, recreational facilities,
amenities, natural features, significant natural features, non-natural
features, incivilities and usability. Size and proximity to the park were also
calculated. Multilevel linear regressions were performed to understand
associations between park features and (1) park satisfaction and (2) park use.
Interactions between park features, ethnicity and socioeconomic status were
explored, and park satisfaction was tested as a mediator in the relationship
between park features and park use. More amenities and greater usability were
associated with increased park satisfaction, while more incivilities were
negatively related to park satisfaction. Incivilities, access and proximity
were also negatively associated with park use. Ethnicity and socioeconomic
status had no moderating role, and there was no evidence for park satisfaction
as a mediator between park features and park use. Results suggest diverse park
features are associated with park satisfaction and park use, but this did not
vary by ethnicity or socioeconomic status. The reduction of incivilities should
be prioritised where the aim is to encourage park satisfaction and park use.

two distinct groups of objects emerge. We hypothesise that the substructures in
the first group, which appear to have a high baryon fraction ($f_{\rm b} \geq
0.95$), are possible infant GC candidates. Objects belonging to the second
group have a high stellar fraction ($f_{\rm star} \geq 0.95$) and show a
potential resemblance to infant ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. The high baryon
fraction objects identified in this study are characterised by a stellar
content similar to the one observed in present-day GCs, but they still contain
a high gas fraction ($f_{\rm gas} \sim 0.95$) and a relatively low amount of
dark matter. They are compact, dense systems. Their sizes are consistent with
recent estimates based on the first observations of possible proto-GCs at high
redshifts. These types of infant GC candidates appear to be more massive and
more abundant in massive host galaxies, indicating that the assembly of
galaxies via mergers may play an important role in building several GC-host
scaling relations. Specifically, we express the relation between the mass of
the most massive infant GC and its host stellar mass as $\log(M_{\rm cl}) =
(0.31\pm0.15)\log(M_{\rm *,gal} + (4.17\pm1.06)$. We also report a new relation
between the most massive infant GC and the parent specific star formation rate
of the form $\log(M_{\rm cl}) = (0.85\pm0.30)\log(sSFR) + \alpha$ that
describes the data at both low and high redshift. Finally, we assess the
present-day GC mass (GC number) -- halo mass relation offers a satisfactory
description of the behaviour of our infant GC candidates at high redshift,
suggesting that such a relation may be set at formation.

present a new range of masses of dark matter particles and their fractions
inside the star. Our analysis is based on the observational fact of the
existence of two pulsars reaching this limit and on the theoretically predicted
reduction of the neutron star maximal mass caused by the accumulation of dark
matter in its interior. We also demonstrate that light dark matter particles
with masses below 0.2 GeV can create an extended halo around the neutron star
leading not to decrease, but to increase of its visible gravitational mass. By
using recent results on the spatial distribution of dark matter in the Milky
Way, we present an estimate of its fraction inside the neutron stars located in
the Galaxy center. We show how the detection of a 2 Msun neutron star in the
most central region of the Galaxy will impose an upper constraint on the mass
of dark matter particles of ~ 60 GeV. Future high precision measurements of the
neutron stars maximal mass near the Galactic center, will put a more stringent
constraint on the mass of the dark matter particle. This last result is
particularly important to prepare ongoing, and future radio and x-ray surveys.

study interesting features about central-place motion. In this work, we
introduce non-instantaneous resetting as a two-state model being a combination
of an exploring state where the walker moves randomly according to a propagator
and a returning state where the walker performs a ballistic motion with
constant velocity towards the origin. We study the emerging transport
properties for two types of reset time probability density functions (PDFs):
exponential and Pareto. In the first case, we find the stationary distribution
and a general expression for the stationary mean square displacement (MSD) in
terms of the propagator. We find that the stationary MSD may increase, decrease
or remain constant with the returning velocity. This depends on the moments of
the propagator. Regarding the Pareto resetting PDF we also study the stationary
distribution and the asymptotic scaling of the MSD for diffusive motion. In
this case, we see that the resetting modifies the transport regime, making the
overall transport sub-diffusive and even reaching a stationary MSD., i.e., a
stochastic localization. This phenomena is also observed in diffusion under
instantaneous Pareto resetting. We check the main results with stochastic
simulations of the process.

High-speed high-resolution schlieren images visualize the shock dynamics
downstream of the nozzle. The flow dynamics during one full PDC cycle is
examined via high-speed Particle Image Velocimetry. A well-suited solid tracer
particle for supersonic reactive flow is determined in a preliminary study to
minimize the PIV measurement error. The investigated operating conditions of
the PDC differ in fill-fraction, which is the percentage of the tube filled
with a reactive mixture. With increasing fill-fraction, the flow features grow
in size and strength, as the propagation velocity of the leading shock
increases. The blow down process of the PDC is characterized by several exhaust
and suction phases. An increase in fill-fraction results in a stronger first
exhaust phase, while the subsequent suction and exhaust phases remain almost
unaffected.

convolutions. The operation moves subsets of activations horizontally and/or
vertically. Spatial convolutions are then replaced with shift operations
followed by point-wise convolutions, significantly reducing computational
costs. In this work, we investigate how shifts should best be applied to high
accuracy CNNs. We apply shifts of two different neighbourhood groups to ResNet
on ImageNet: the originally introduced 8-connected (8C) neighbourhood shift and
the less well studied 4-connected (4C) neighbourhood shift. We find that when
replacing ResNet's spatial convolutions with shifts, both shift neighbourhoods
give equal ImageNet accuracy, showing the sufficiency of small neighbourhoods
for large images. Interestingly, when incorporating shifts to all point-wise
convolutions in residual networks, 4-connected shifts outperform 8-connected
shifts. Such a 4-connected shift setup gives the same accuracy as full residual
networks while reducing the number of parameters and FLOPs by over 40%. We then
highlight that without spatial convolutions, ResNet's downsampling/upsampling
bottleneck channel structure is no longer needed. We show a new, 4C shift-based
residual network, much shorter than the original ResNet yet with a higher
accuracy for the same computational cost. This network is the highest accuracy

different but related tasks. Acoustic events can provide useful information for
recognizing acoustic scenes. However, most of the datasets are provided without
either the acoustic event or scene labels. To utilize the acoustic event
information to improve the performance of ASC tasks, we present the cross-task
pre-training mechanism which utilizes acoustic event information from the
pre-trained AED model for ASC tasks. On the other hand, most of the models were
designed and implemented on platforms with rich computing resources, and the
on-device applications were limited. To solve this problem, we use model
distillation method to compress our cross-task model to enable on-device
acoustic scene classification. In this paper, the cross-task models and their
student model were trained and evaluated on two datasets: TAU Urban Acoustic
Scenes 2019 dataset and TUT Acoustic Scenes 2017 dataset. Results have shown
that cross-task pre-training mechanism can significantly improve the
performance of ASC tasks. The performance of our best model improved relatively
9.5% in the TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes 2019 dataset, and also improved 10% in
the TUT Acoustic Scenes 2017 dataset compared with the official baseline. At
the same time, the performance of the student model is much better than that of
the model without teachers.

tournament $T$ is quasirandom if and only if $T$ contains each $h$-vertex
tournament the ""correct number"" of times as a subtournament. In this paper we
investigate the relationship between quasirandomness of $T$ and the count of a
single $h$-vertex tournament $H$ in $T$. We consider two types of counts, the
global one and the local one.
  We first observe that if $T$ has the correct global count of $H$ and $h \geq
7$ then quasirandomness of $T$ is only forced if $H$ is transitive. The next
natural question when studying quasirandom objects asks whether possessing the
correct local counts of $H$ is enough to force quasirandomness of $T$. A
tournament $H$ is said to be locally forcing if it has this property.
  Variants of the local forcing problem have been studied before in both the
graph and hypergraph settings. Perhaps the closest analogue of our problem was
considered by Simonovits and S\'os who looked at whether having ""correct
counts"" of a fixed graph $H$ as an induced subgraph of $G$ implies $G$ must be
quasirandom, in an appropriate sense. They proved that this is indeed the case
when $H$ is regular and conjectured that it holds for all $H$ (except the path
on 3 vertices). Contrary to the Simonovits-S\'os conjecture, in the tournament
setting we prove that a constant proportion of all tournaments are not locally
forcing. In fact, any locally forcing tournament must itself be strongly
quasirandom. On the other hand, unlike the global forcing case, we construct
infinite families of non-transitive locally forcing tournaments.

framework for understanding mode formation, can yield a wealth of information
about deep stellar interiors. In this paper, we seek to develop a formalism for
treating the effects of deeply buried core magnetic fields on mixed modes in
evolved stars, where the fields are moderate, i.e. not strong enough to disrupt
wave propagation, but where they may be too strong for non-degenerate
first-order perturbation theory to be applied. The magnetic field is
incorporated in a way that avoids having to use this. Inclusion of the Lorentz
force term is shown to yield a system of differential equations that allows for
the magnetically-affected eigenfunctions to be computed from scratch, rather
than following the approach of first-order perturbation theory. For
sufficiently weak fields, coupling between different spherical harmonics can be
neglected, allowing for reduction to a second-order system of ordinary
differential equations akin to the usual oscillation equations that can be
solved analogously. We derive expressions for (i) the mixed-mode quantisation
condition in the presence of a field and (ii) the frequency shift associated
with the magnetic field. In addition, for modes of low degree we uncover an
extra offset term in the quantisation condition that is sensitive to properties
of the evanescent zone. These expressions may be inverted to extract
information about the stellar structure and magnetic field from observational
data.

complex architectures that manage several aspects of a dialogue, including the
user utterance, the system actions, and the slot-value pairs defined in a

into a considerable latency in the dialogue state prediction, which limits the
deployments of the models in real-world applications, particularly when task
scalability (i.e. amount of slots) is a crucial factor. In this paper, we
propose an innovative neural model for dialogue state tracking, named Global

We report experiments on three different languages (English, Italian, and

  Our methodology is based on a combinatorial objective function that is
related to correlation clustering on graphs but enables the design of much more
efficient algorithms that also seamlessly generalize to hypergraphs. When there
are only two label types, our objective can be optimized in polynomial time,
using an algorithm based on minimum cuts. Minimizing our objective becomes
NP-hard with more than two label types, but we develop fast approximation

noisy channels can be formulated as the (unsupervised) training of an
autoencoder consisting of the cascade of encoder, channel, and decoder. An
important limitation of the approach is that training should be generally
carried out from scratch for each new channel. To cope with this problem, prior
works considered joint training over multiple channels with the aim of finding
a single pair of encoder and decoder that works well on a class of channels. As
a result, joint training ideally mimics the operation of non-coherent
transmission schemes. In this paper, we propose to obviate the limitations of
joint training via meta-learning: Rather than training a common model for all
channels, meta-learning finds a common initialization vector that enables fast
training on any channel. The approach is validated via numerical results,
demonstrating significant training speed-ups, with effective encoders and
decoders obtained with as little as one iteration of Stochastic Gradient
Descent.

formation at the interface between the MoSe$_{2}$ ML and the metallic

were skeptical that technology could fully replace human empathy. Many
predicted that 'man and machine' would increasingly collaborate in undertaking
clinical decisions, with mixed opinions about the benefits and harms of such an

model-independent technique able to describe the late expansion of the
universe. Indeed, given only the observational assumption of the cosmological
principle, it allows to study the today observed accelerated evolution of the
Hubble flow without assuming specific cosmological models. In general,
cosmography is used to reconstruct the Hubble parameter as a function of the
redshift, assuming an arbitrary fiducial value for the current matter density,
$\Omega_m$, and analysing low redshift cosmological data. Here we propose a
different strategy, linking together the parametric cosmographic behavior of
the late universe expansion with the small scale universe. In this way, we do
not need to assume any ""a priori"" values for the cosmological parameters, since
these are constrained at early epochs using both the Cosmic Microwave
Background Radiation (CMBR) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data. In
order to test this strategy, we describe the late expansion of the universe
using the Pad\'e polynomials. This approach is discussed in the light of the
recent $H(z)$ values indicators, combined with Supernovae Pantheon sample,
galaxy clustering and early universe data, as CMBR and BAO. We found an
interesting dependence of the current matter density value with cosmographic
parameters, proving the inaccuracy of setting the value of $\Omega_m$ in
cosmographic analyses, and a non-negligible effect of the cosmographic
parameters on the CMBR temperature anisotropy power spectrum. Finally, we found
that the cosmographic series, truncated at third order, shows a better $\chi^2$
best fit value then the vanilla $\Lambda$CDM model. This can be interpreted as
the requirement that higher order corrections have to be considered to
correctly describe low redshift data and remove the degeneration of the models.

scattering state contributions cannot saturate the QCD sum rules at the hadron

the diquark and antidiquark constituents, the Feynman diagrams can be divided
into the factorizable and nonfactorizable diagrams. The factorizable diagrams
consist of two colored clusters and lead to a stable tetraquark state. The
nonfactorizable Feynman diagrams correspond to the tunnelling effects, which
play a minor important role in the QCD sum rules, and are consistent with the
small width of the $Z_c(3900)$. It is feasible to apply the QCD sum rules to
study the tetraquark states, which begin to receive contributions at the order
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^0)$, not at the order $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$.

properties. Here, we emulate both sampling techniques on a simple spiking model

We describe a general effect: when the inter-electrode distance is small,
electrodes sample overlapping regions in space, which increases the correlation
between the signals. For coarse-sampled activity, this can produce power-law
distributions even for non-critical systems. In contrast, spike recordings do
not suffer this particular bias and underlying dynamics can be identified. This
may resolve why coarse measures and spikes have produced contradicting results

to study the acceleration of particles at shock waves and their transport and
interactions in the surrounding interstellar medium. In this paper, we focus on
the supernova remnant W28, which over the years has been observed in all energy
domains from radio waves to very-high-energy gamma rays. The bright gamma-ray
emission detected from molecular clouds located in its vicinity revealed the
presence of accelerated GeV and TeV particles in the region. An enhanced
ionization rate has also been measured by means of millimetre observations, but
such observations alone cannot tell us whether the enhancement is due to low
energy (MeV) cosmic rays (either protons or electrons) or the X-ray photons
emitted by the shocked gas. The goal of this study is to determine the origin
of the enhanced ionization rate and to infer from multiwavelength observations
the spectrum of cosmic rays accelerated at the supernova remnant shock in the
unprecedented range spanning from MeV to multi-TeV particle energies. We
developed a model to describe the transport of X-ray photons into the molecular
cloud, and we fitted the radio, millimeter, and gamma-ray data to derive the
spectrum of the radiating particles. The contribution from X-ray photons to the
enhanced ionization rate is negligible, and therefore the ionization must be
due to cosmic rays. Even though we cannot exclude a contribution to the
ionization rate coming from cosmic ray electrons, we show that a scenario where
cosmic ray protons explain both the gamma-ray flux and the enhanced ionization
rate provides the most natural fit to multiwavelength data. This strongly
suggests that the intensity of CR protons is enhanced in the region for
particle energies in a very broad range covering almost 6 orders of magnitude:
from $\lesssim 100$ MeV up to several tens of TeV.

to overcome these issues, we adopted a framework known as False Positive

our proposal outperforms all the alternative Machine Learning solutions already

distribution of kilometre-sized (radius = 1-10 km) KBO represents a signature
of initial planetesimal sizes when planets form. These kilometre-sized KBOs are
extremely faint, and it is impossible to detect them directly. Instead,
monitoring of stellar occultation events is one possible way to discover these
small KBOs. Hitherto, however, there has been no observational evidence for the
occultation events by KBOs with radii of 1-10 km. Here we report the first
detection of a single occultation event candidate by a KBO with a radius of
$\sim$1.3 km, which is simultaneously provided by two low-cost small telescopes
coupled with commercial CMOS cameras. From this detection, we conclude that a
surface number density of KBOs with radii exceeding $\sim 1.2$ km is $\sim 6

theoretical size distribution model with an excess signature at a radius of 1-2

Firstly, separate particle reconstructions with a sparsity-based algorithm are

which 3D correlation is performed, yielding a predictor displacement field that
allows to efficiently match particles at the two time instants. As these
particles are still located on a voxel grid, the third, final step achieves
particle position refinement to their actual subvoxel position by a global
optimization process, also accounting for their intensities. As it strongly
leverages on principles from tomographic reconstruction, the technique is
termed Double-Frame Tomo-PTV (DF-TPTV). Synthetic tests on a complex turbulent
flow show that the method achieves high particle and vector detection
efficiency, up to seeding densities of around 0.08 particles per pixel (ppp),
while its root-mean-square error of velocity estimation is lower to that of
state-of-the-art similar methods. Results from an experimental campaign on a
transitional round air jet at Reynolds number 4600 are also presented. During
the tests, seeding density varies from 0.06 to 0.03 ppp on average. Associated
to an outlier rejection scheme based on temporal statistics, DF-TPTV vector
fields truthfully correspond to the instantaneous jet dynamics. Quantitative
performance assessment is provided by introducing statistics performed by bin
averaging, upon assuming statistical axisymmetry of the jet. Mean and
fluctuating axial velocity components in the jet near-field are compared with
reference results obtained from planar PIV at higher seeding density.

the Td phase (which is a type-II Weyl semimetal) by breaking the inversion

the reasons is that the learned policy cannot perform flexible and resilient
behaviors as traditional methods to adapt to diverse environments. In this
paper, we consider the problem that a mobile robot learns adaptive and
resilient behaviors for navigating in unseen uncertain environments while
avoiding collisions. We present a novel approach for uncertainty-aware
navigation by introducing an uncertainty-aware predictor to model the
environmental uncertainty, and we propose a novel uncertainty-aware navigation
network to learn resilient behaviors in the prior unknown environments. To
train the proposed uncertainty-aware network more stably and efficiently, we
present the temperature decay training paradigm, which balances exploration and
exploitation during the training process. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that our approach can learn resilient behaviors in diverse
environments and generate adaptive trajectories according to environmental
uncertainties.

dual polarization beamforming (DPBF), to design beam patterns. Instead of using
only a single element-polarization, as for SPBF, a desired beam pattern is
designed as the sum of powers for two orthogonal element-polarizations. So,
with DPBF the focus is on total radiated power beam patterns. The DPBF
technique provides additional degrees of freedom to form a desired beam pattern
such that amplitude variations in the beamforming vector can often be
significantly reduced, potentially to uniform amplitude. Phase-only
beamforming, possibly using only minor amplitude variations, is a very

potential of full power amplifier utilization. In this paper we apply DPBF to
uniform linear arrays (ULAs) as well as uniform rectangular arrays (URAs). In
communication systems, it is often desired to have a second beam with identical

has a notoriously slow convergence rate; meanwhile, a faster rate of
convergence can potentially be obtained by using sparse grid quadratures, but
these lead to discretized systems that are non-convex due to the involvement of
negative quadrature weights. In this paper, we analyze instead the application
of a quasi-Monte Carlo method, which retains the desirable convexity structure

our uncertainties. We also find that the [C/O] ratios for z ~ 5 DLAs are
consistent with those of the very metal-poor DLAs. Additionally, using [C/O]
and [Si/O] to constrain the nucleosynthesis models, we estimate that the
probability distributions of the progenitor star masses for three relatively
metal-poor DLAs are centered around 12 M_{\odot} to 17 M_{\odot}. Finally, the
z ~ 5 absorbers show a different metallicity-velocity dispersion relation than
lower redshift DLAs, suggesting that they may be tracing a different population
of galaxies.

However, it requires huge amounts of pixelwise annotations to yield accurate
results. While recent progress in computer vision algorithms has been heavily
boosted by large ground-level datasets, the labeling time has hampered progress
in low altitude UAV applications, mostly due to the difficulty imposed by large
object scales and pose variations. Motivated by the lack of a large video
aerial dataset, we introduce a new one, with high resolution (4K) images and
manually-annotated dense labels every 50 frames. To help the video labeling
process, we make an important step towards automatic annotation and propose
SegProp, an iterative flow-based method with geometric constrains to propagate
the semantic labels to frames that lack human annotations. This results in a
dataset with more than 50k annotated frames - the largest of its kind, to the
best of our knowledge. Our experiments show that SegProp surpasses current
state-of-the-art label propagation methods by a significant margin.
Furthermore, when training a semantic segmentation deep neural net using the
automatically annotated frames, we obtain a compelling overall performance
boost at test time of 16.8% mean F-measure over a baseline trained only with

aerial action recognition is difficult due to the need for a large number of
training aerial human action videos. Collecting a large number of human action
aerial videos is costly, time-consuming, and difficult. In this paper, we
explore two alternative data sources to improve aerial action classification
when only a few training aerial examples are available. As a first data source,
we resort to video games. We collect plenty of aerial game action videos using
two gaming engines. For the second data source, we leverage conditional
Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks to generate aerial features from
ground videos. Given that both data sources have some limitations, e.g. game
videos are biased towards specific actions categories (fighting, shooting,
etc.,), and it is not easy to generate good discriminative GAN-generated
features for all types of actions, we need to efficiently integrate two dataset
sources with few available real aerial training videos. To address this
challenge of the heterogeneous nature of the data, we propose to use a disjoint
multitask learning framework. We feed the network with real and game, or real
and GAN-generated data in an alternating fashion to obtain an improved action
classifier. We validate the proposed approach on two aerial action datasets and
demonstrate that features from aerial game videos and those generated from GAN
can be extremely useful for an improved action recognition in real aerial

determinant representation for the temperature-, time-, and space-dependent
correlation functions which is very easy to implement numerically and
constitute the starting point for the analytical investigation of the
asymptotics. Making use of this determinant representation and the solution of
an associated Riemann-Hilbert problem we derive the low-energy asymptotics of
the correlators in the spin-incoherent regime characterized by near
ground-state charge degrees of freedom but a highly thermally disordered spin
sector. The asymptotics present features reminiscent of spin-charge separation
with the spin part exponentially decaying in space separation and oscillating
with a period proportional to the statistics parameter while the charge part
presents scaling with anomalous exponents which cannot be described by any
unitary conformal field theory. The momentum distribution and the Fourier
transform of the dynamical Green's function are asymmetrical for arbitrary
statistics, a direct consequence of the broken space-reversal symmetry. Due to
the exponential decay the momentum distribution $n(k)$ at zero temperature does
not present algebraic singularities but the tails obey the universal decay
$\lim_{k\rightarrow\pm\infty}n(k)\sim C/k^4$ with the amplitude $C$ given by
Tan's contact. As a function of the statistics parameter the contact is a

gramian based measures, which include the Hankel interaction index array, the
participation matrix and the $\Sigma_{2}$ method. The gramian based measures
however have issues with input and output scaling. Generally, this is resolved
by scaling all inputs and outputs to have equal range. However, we demonstrate
how this can result in an incorrect pairing and examine alternative methods of
scaling the gramian based measures, using either row or column sums, or by
utilizing the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm. The benefits of these scaling
strategies are first illustrated by applying them to the control structure
selection for a heat exchanger network. Then, to more systematically analyze
the benefits of the scaling schemes, a multiple input multiple output model
generator is used to test the different schemes on a large number of systems.
This, along with implementation of automatic controller tuning, allows for a
statistical comparison of the scaling methods. This assessment shows
considerable benefits to be gained from the alternative scaling of the gramian
based measures, especially when using the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm. The use of

momentum that may deliver the best of expectations over many application
sectors across the field. For this to occur, the entire community stands in
front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of AI techniques
brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not
present in the last hype of AI. Paradigms underlying this problem fall within
the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is acknowledged as a crucial
feature for the practical deployment of AI models. This overview examines the
existing literature in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is
yet to be reached. We summarize previous efforts to define explainability in
Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition that covers prior conceptual
propositions with a major focus on the audience for which explainability is
sought. We then propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions
related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including
those aimed at Deep Learning methods for which a second taxonomy is built. This
literature analysis serves as the background for a series of challenges faced
by XAI, such as the crossroads between data fusion and explainability. Our
prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence,
namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real
organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its
core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to XAI with a reference
material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage
experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI
in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of
interpretability.

robustness of those techniques. Recently, it has been shown that adversarial
attacks easily fool deep neural networks to misclassify objects. The robustness
of optical flow networks to adversarial attacks, however, has not been studied
so far. In this paper, we extend adversarial patch attacks to optical flow
networks and show that such attacks can compromise their performance. We show
that corrupting a small patch of less than 1% of the image size can
significantly affect optical flow estimates. Our attacks lead to noisy flow
estimates that extend significantly beyond the region of the attack, in many
cases even completely erasing the motion of objects in the scene. While
networks using an encoder-decoder architecture are very sensitive to these
attacks, we found that networks using a spatial pyramid architecture are less
affected. We analyse the success and failure of attacking both architectures by
visualizing their feature maps and comparing them to classical optical flow
techniques which are robust to these attacks. We also demonstrate that such
attacks are practical by placing a printed pattern into real scenes.

with a set of predefined actions. Capturing both, semantic content and motion,
along the video frames is key to achieve high accuracy performance on this
task. Most of the state-of-the-art methods rely on RGB frames for extracting
the semantics and pre-computed optical flow fields as a motion cue. Then, both
are combined using deep neural networks. Yet, it has been argued that such
models are not able to leverage the motion information extracted from the
optical flow, but instead the optical flow allows for better recognition of
people and objects in the video. This urges the need to explore different cues
or models that can extract motion in a more informative fashion. To tackle this
issue, we propose to explore the predictive coding network, so called PredNet,
a recurrent neural network that propagates predictive coding errors across
layers and time steps. We analyze whether PredNet can better capture motions in
videos by estimating over time the representations extracted from pre-trained
networks for action recognition. In this way, the model only relies on the
video frames, and does not need pre-processed optical flows as input. We report
the effectiveness of our proposed model on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets.

discrete field theories overcomes the difficulties associated with learning
continuous theories by artificial intelligence. The serving algorithm of
discrete field theories belongs to the family of structure-preserving geometric
algorithms, which have been proven to be superior to the conventional
algorithms based on discretization of differential equations. The effectiveness
of the method and algorithms developed is demonstrated using the examples of
nonlinear oscillations and the Kepler problem. In particular, the learning

hyperbolic escaping orbits, of the solar system without learning or knowing
Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation. The proposed algorithms are
also applicable when effects of special relativity and general relativity are

devices prior to an analysis device, a non instantaneous electric ejection
pulse applied in the region of ion storage is used to accelerate ions into the
time-of-flight analyzer. The calculated mass value of the ions from the
time-of-flight is dependent on the duration of the field transition up to full
strength. For novel applications dedicated to precision measurements, such as
multi-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometry of short-lived isotopes, the
goal is to continuously decrease the measurement uncertainty while providing a
mass accuracy on the same order. Even though dynamic-field models for
time-of-flight mass spectrometry have been considered in the past for
technological advances, it is important to study the accuracy of the measured
mass in this context. Using a simplified linear model for the field transition,
we provide a basic investigation of the scenario, and discuss the deviation
from the classical ""mass-over-charge"" dependency of the ions' time-of-flight,
which becomes violated. The emerging mass discrepancy depends on the distance
between the mass of the ion used for calibration and that of the ion of
interest and, in extreme cases, can increase to about one percent for systems
with short times-of-flight. However, for typical conditions in single-reference
multi-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometry, mass deviations caused by
this effect typically remain below the 1 ppm level. If a mass calibration using
two or more ion species is possible during the measurement, the effect becomes
negligible for appropriate choices of reference masses.

dark energy. The Lagrangian of the model is built with kinetic terms of the
field strength for each $p$-form coupled to a scalar field $\phi$ through a
kinetic function. We assume that this scalar field is responsible for the
present accelerated expansion of the Universe. Since we are interested in
cosmological applications, we specialize the analysis to a 4-dimensional case,
using an anisotropic space-time. By studying the dynamical equations, we
investigate the evolution of the dark energy density parameter, the effective

presented, based on using angular size redshift relation. This approach is
appropriate for general case of any multicomponent universe (with matter,

we derive a quantum kinetic equation for Bloch electrons in the presence of

possible to compute transport coefficients at arbitrary orders of

it allows for easy unauthorized reproduction of information. Digital
watermarking came up while trying to solve this problem. Its main idea is to
embed a watermark into a host digital content without affecting its quality.
Moreover, watermarking can be used in several applications such as
authentication, copy control, indexation, Copyright protection, etc. In this
paper, we propose a blind robust image watermarking approach as a solution to
the problem of copyright protection of digital images. The underlying concept
of our method is to apply a discrete cosine transform (DCT) to the magnitude
resulting from a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) applied to the original
image. Then, the watermark is embedded by modifying the coefficients of the DCT
using a secret key to increase security. Experimental results show the
robustness of the proposed technique to a wide range of common attacks, e.g.,
Low-Pass Gaussian Filtering, JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, salt & pepper
noise, Gaussian Smoothing and Histogram equalization. The proposed method
achieves a Peak signal-to-noise-ration (PSNR) value greater than 66 (dB) and
ensures a perfect watermark extraction.

refitting block penalties that only act on the support of the estimated

ions is recognized to affect the dielectric response of electrolytes in a
complex way that depends on the ion-water and ion-ion interactions and
respective concentrations. Pore solutions in cement-based materials are complex
and age-dependent exhibiting different ion-pair states, which make them an
interesting candidate for the study of the complex pore solution found in
geomaterials in general. Here, we study the dielectric properties of bulk
aqueous solutions representative of the pore solution found in cement-based
materials using molecular dynamics simulations. Broadband dielectric spectra
and frequency-dependent conductivities are provided. A mean-field upscaling
strategy is deployed to compute the dielectric response at cement paste scale.
In cement-based materials, the measurement of dielectric properties can be used
for non-destructive monitoring of concrete structures conditions and to unravel
details of the hierarchical pore structure of the material, notably at
early-age when the microstructure of the material changes significantly. Our
results can be used in the interpretation of high-frequency electromagnetic
methods, such as ground-penetrating radar, enhancing the quality of

machine-learning software package - to search mixtures of commonly used lithium
and sodium salts for super-concentrated aqueous electrolytes with wide
electrochemical stability windows. Dragonfly autonomously managed the robotic
test-stand, recommending electrolyte designs to test and receiving experimental
feedback in real time. In 40 hours of continuous experimentation over a
four-dimensional design space with millions of potential candidates, Dragonfly
discovered a novel, mixed-anion aqueous sodium electrolyte with a wider
electrochemical stability window than state-of-the-art sodium electrolyte. A
human-guided design process may have missed this optimal electrolyte. This
result demonstrates the possibility of integrating robotics with
machine-learning to rapidly and autonomously discover novel battery materials.

computer algebra system Maple, is presented. The QCP combines sophisticated
electronic structure methods and Maple's easy-to-use graphical interface to
enable computation and visualization of the electronic energies and properties
of molecules. Here we describe how the QCP can be used in the chemistry
classroom using lessons provided within the package. In particular, the
calculation and visualization of molecular orbitals of hydrogen fluoride, the
application of the particle in a box to conjugated dyes, the use of geometry
optimization and normal mode analysis for hypochlorous acid, and the
thermodynamics of combustion of methane.
