analysis, and optimization of wireless cloud caching networks comprised of
multiple-antenna radio units (RUs) inside clouds. We consider the Matern
cluster process to model RUs and the probabilistic content placement to cache
files in RUs. Accordingly, we study the exact hit probability for a user of
interest for two strategies; closest selection, where the user is served by the
closest RU that has its requested file, and best selection, where the serving
RU having the requested file provides the maximum instantaneous received power
at the user. As key steps for the analyses, the Laplace transform of out of
cloud interference, the desired link distance distribution in the closest
selection, and the desired link received power distribution in the best
selection are derived. Also, we approximate the derived exact hit probabilities
for both the closest and the best selections in such a way that the related
objective functions for the content caching design of the network can lead to
tractable concave optimization problems. Solving the optimization problems, we
propose algorithms to efficiently find their optimal content placements.
Finally, we investigate the impact of different parameters such as the number
of antennas and the cache memory size on the caching performance.

abundance and two-point correlation function (2PCF), for a wide range of
cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ within the standard
$\Lambda$CDM paradigm, focusing on intermediate-height peaks with

dependence of the peak abundance can be described by a one-parameter fitting
formula that is accurate to within $\sim3\%$. The peak 2PCFs are shown to
feature a self-similar behaviour: if the peak separation is rescaled by the
mean inter-peak distance, catalogues with different minimum peak SNR values
have identical clustering, which suggests that the peak abundance and
clustering are closely interconnected. A simple fitting model for the rescaled
2PCF is given, which together with the peak abundance model above can predict
peak 2PCFs with an accuracy better than $\sim5\%$. The abundance and 2PCFs for
intermediate peaks have very different dependencies on $\Omega_m$ and
$\sigma_8$, implying that their combination can be used to break the degeneracy
between these two parameters.

reaction; however, it is still not understood with the required precision. It
has a great importance both in Big Bang nucleosynthesis and in solar hydrogen
burning. The low mass number of the reaction partners makes it also suitable
for testing microscopic calculations.
  Despite the high number of experimental studies, none of them addresses the
$^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction cross sections above 3.1-MeV
center-of-mass energy. Recently, a previously unobserved resonance in the
$^6$Li(p,$\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction suggested a new level in $^7$Be, which would
also have an impact on the $^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction in the
energy range above 4.0 MeV. The aim of the present experiment is to measure the
$^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction cross section in the energy range of
the proposed level.
  For this investigation the activation technique was used. A thin window
gas-cell target confining $^3$He gas was irradiated using an $\alpha$ beam. The
$^7$Be produced was implanted into the exit foil. The $^7$Be activity was
determined by counting the $\gamma$ rays following its decay by a well-shielded
high-purity germanium detector.
  Reaction cross sections have been determined between $E_{cm} = 4.0 - 4.4$ MeV
with 0.04-MeV steps covering the energy range of the proposed nuclear level.
One lower-energy cross-section point was also determined to be able to compare
the results with previous studies.
  A constant cross section of around 10.5 $\mu$barn was observed around the
$^7$Be proton separation energy. An upper limit of 45 neV for the strength of a
$^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be resonance is derived.

electrostatic interactions. We assumed that all the Flory-Huggins \c{hi}
parameters were equal to 0 and showed that the charge correlation attraction
solely can cause microphase separation with long-range order; a phase diagram
was constructed by varying the volume fraction of the uncharged block and the
electrostatic interaction parameter {\lambda}. The obtained phase diagram was
compared to the phase diagram of corresponding neutral diblock-copolymers.
Surprisingly, the differences between these phase diagrams are rather subtle;
the same phases are observed, and the positions of the ODT points are similar
if the {\lambda}-parameter is considered as an ""effective"" \c{hi}-parameter.
Next, we studied the position of the ODT for lamellar structure depending on
the chain length N. It turned out that while for the uncharged
diblock-copolymer the product \c{hi}crN was almost independent of N, for the
diblock-copolymers with one charged block we observed a significant increase in
{\lambda}crN upon increasing N. It can be attributed to the fact that the
counterion entropy prevents the formation of ordered structures. This was
supported by studying the ODT in diblock-copolymers with charged blocks and
counterions cross-linked to the charged monomer units. The ODT for such systems
was observed at significantly lower values of {\lambda} with the difference
being more pronounced at longer chain lengths N. The diffusion of counterions
in the obtained ordered structures was studied and compared to the case of a
system with the same number of charged groups but homogeneous structure; the
diffusion coefficient in a direction in the lamellar plane was found to be
higher than in any direction in homogeneous structure.

identify realistic conditions for detuning the chain adiabatically in order to

the cited and citing sides are combined by a matrix approach. IWs emerge as a

is a (vector-based) non-network indicator of impact, but after recursion (i.e.
repeated improvement by iteration), IWs can be considered a network measure of

distribution. However, real-world implementations of deep learning
applications, such as autonomous driving and content classification are likely
to operate in the open-world environment. In this paper, we demonstrate the
success of open-world evasion attacks, where adversarial examples are generated
from out-of-distribution inputs (OOD adversarial examples). In our study, we
use 11 state-of-the-art neural network models trained on 3 image datasets of
varying complexity. We first demonstrate that state-of-the-art detectors for
out-of-distribution data are not robust against OOD adversarial examples. We
then consider 5 known defenses for adversarial examples, including
state-of-the-art robust training methods, and show that against these defenses,
OOD adversarial examples can achieve up to 4$\times$ higher target success
rates compared to adversarial examples generated from in-distribution data. We
also take a quantitative look at how open-world evasion attacks may affect
real-world systems. Finally, we present the first steps towards a robust
open-world machine learning system.

parameters with which earthquake engineers currently use to take into account
the influence of motion duration for the dynamic analysis of structures. In

a structure experiences during the motion, is also one another method to find

study, a new approach is proposed to determine the number of nonlinear cycles.
Moreover, a parameter based on both hysteretic energy and number of nonlinear

of the motion. The proposed parameter is expected to demonstrate a high
correlation with the response of structures even for the structures having
deteriorative and degraded behaviour during the motion. This matter is examined
and confirmed with the application of this parameter to predict the influence

revealed that the proposed parameter is able to well predict the influence of

problem that aims to learn a mapping between unaligned image pairs in diverse
domains. Recent advances in this field like MUNIT and DRIT mainly focus on
disentangling content and style/attribute from a given image first, then
directly adopting the global style to guide the model to synthesize new domain
images. However, this kind of approaches severely incurs contradiction if the
target domain images are content-rich with multiple discrepant objects. In this
paper, we present a simple yet effective instance-aware image-to-image
translation approach (INIT), which employs the fine-grained local (instance)
and global styles to the target image spatially. The proposed INIT exhibits
three import advantages: (1) the instance-level objective loss can help learn a
more accurate reconstruction and incorporate diverse attributes of objects; (2)
the styles used for target domain of local/global areas are from corresponding
spatial regions in source domain, which intuitively is a more reasonable
mapping; (3) the joint training process can benefit both fine and coarse
granularity and incorporates instance information to improve the quality of
global translation. We also collect a large-scale benchmark for the new
instance-level translation task. We observe that our synthetic images can even
benefit real-world vision tasks like generic object detection.

variant of the ball walk Markov chain and show that, roughly, the expected
number of arithmetic operations per-step of this Markov chain is $O(m)$ that is
sublinear in the input size $mn$--the per-step time of all prior Markov chains.
Subsequently, we give a rounding algorithm that succeeds with probability
$1-\varepsilon$ in
$\tilde{O}(mn^{4.5}\mbox{polylog}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon},\frac{R}{r}))$

satisfy the RZIF property. As the outer Reynolds number is increased, the
ribbon branch is succeeded by two types of heteroclinic orbits, both of which
connect saddle states containing two axially stacked pairs of axisymmetric
vortices. One heteroclinic orbit is non-axisymmetric, with excursions that
resemble the ribbons, while the other remains axisymmetric.

Operators (ISOs) with the ability to address ramping capacity shortages. ISOs
procure flexible ramping capability by committing more generating units or
reserving a certain amount of head room of committed units. In this paper, we
raise the concern of the possibility that the procured ramping capability
cannot be deployed in real-time operations. As a solution to the non-delivery
issue, we provide a new ramping product designed to improve reliability and
reduce the expected operating cost. The trajectory of start-up and shutdown
processes is also considered in determining the ramping capability. A new
optimization problem is formulated using mixed integer linear programming to be
readily applied to practical power system operation. The performance of this
proposed method is verified through simulations using a small-scale system and
IEEE 118-bus systems. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
formulation can realize improved generation scheduling alleviating capacity

  Matrix Multiplication, 3-SUM, and Beyond",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed processing frameworks, such as MapReduce, Hadoop, and Spark are
popular systems for processing large amounts of data. The design of efficient
algorithms in these frameworks is a challenging problem, as the systems both
require parallelism---since datasets are so large that multiple machines are
necessary---and limit the degree of parallelism---since the number of machines
grows sublinearly in the size of the data. Although MapReduce is over a dozen
years old~\cite{dean2008mapreduce}, many fundamental problems, such as Matrix
Multiplication, 3-SUM, and All Pairs Shortest Paths,
  lack efficient MapReduce algorithms. We study these problems in the MapReduce
setting. Our main contribution is to exhibit smooth trade-offs between the
memory available on each machine, and the total number of machines necessary
for each problem. Overall, we take the memory available to each machine as a
parameter, and aim to minimize the number of rounds and number of machines.
  In this paper, we build on the well-known MapReduce theoretical framework
initiated by Karloff, Suri, and Vassilvitskii ~\cite{karloff2010model} and give
algorithms for many of these problems. The key to efficient algorithms in this
setting lies in defining a sublinear number of large (polynomially sized)
subproblems, that can then be solved in parallel. We give strategies for
MapReduce-friendly partitioning, that result in new algorithms for all of the
above problems. Specifically, we give constant round algorithms for the
Orthogonal Vector (OV) and 3-SUM problems, and $O(\log n)$-round algorithms for
Matrix Multiplication, All Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP), and Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT), among others. In all of these we exhibit trade-offs between
the number of machines and memory per machine.

bulk transfer, one or more multicast forwarding trees which preferentially use
lightly loaded network links. Multiple multicast trees are used per bulk

hence finish quickly from congested destinations. These decisions--how many
trees to construct and which receivers to serve using a given tree--result from
an optimization problem that minimizes a weighted sum of transfers' completion

single rotary-wing UAV acts as a relay of data payloads for downlink
transmission requests generated randomly by two ground nodes (GNs) in a
wireless network. The goal is to optimize the UAV trajectory in order to
minimize the expected average communication delay to serve these random
requests. It is shown that the problem can be cast as a semi-Markov decision
process (SMDP), and the resulting minimization problem is solved via
multi-chain policy iteration. The optimality of a two-scale optimization
approach is proved: the optimal trajectory in the communication phase greedily
minimizes the communication delay of the current request while moving between
the current start position and a target end position (inner optimization); the
end positions are selected to minimize the expected average long-term delay in
the SMDP (outer optimization). Numerical simulations show that the expected
average delay is minimized when the UAV moves towards the geometric center of
the GNs during phases in which it is not actively servicing transmission
requests, and demonstrate significant improvements over sensible heuristics.
Finally, it is revealed that the optimal end positions of communication phases
become increasingly independent of the data payload, for large data payload
values.

host two intersecting nodal rings protected by two mirror planes, respectively.
One ring is composed of type-I nodes, where the two crossing bands have
opposite slop sign in their dispersions. The other ring consists of both type-I
and type-II nodes (the slop signs of the two bands are the same in certain
direction). In the presence of SOC, the former nodal ring is gapped totally
while the later one evolves into ten pairs of Weyl nodes, with two of them
being type-I and eight being type-II. The type-II Weyl nodes are further
classified into two kinds with different velocity matrix when described in Weyl
equation near the nodes. Fermi arcs from topological surface states are
observed in the surface projected energy dispersions. It is notably that
YCoC$_2$ has been reported as a superconductor with critical temperature $T_c$
of 4.2 K. This makes it very attractive since including superconducting into
topological semimetal state might result in topological superconductivity and
be used to synthesize Majorana zero modes.

a description of the qubit in terms of static tunnelling energy and a bias

that the bath response dramatically changes during the system dynamics, going
from non-resonant at small times to resonant behavior at long times. When the

results show that the bath can provide beneficial effects to the success of the

contagious and rapidly mutative. However, its epidemiological characteristics

face-to-face inquiry results in an inaccurate and time-consuming manner of data
collection and aggregation. Accordingly, the inferred spectrum of syndromes can
be incomplete and lagged. With a massive number of users being sensors, online
social media can indeed provide an alternative approach. Voluntary reports in
Twitter and its variants can deliver not only exterior signs but also interior
feelings such as emotions. These sophisticated signals can further be
efficiently collected and aggregated in a real-time manner, and a comprehensive
spectrum of syndromes could thus be inferred. Taking Weibo as an example, it is
confirmed that a regional spectrum of symptoms can be credibly sensed. Aside
from the differences in symptoms and treatment incentives between northern and
southern China, it is also surprising that patients in the south are more
optimistic, while those in the north demonstrate more intense emotions. The
differences sensed from Weibo can even help improve the performance of
regressions in monitoring influenza. Our results suggest that self-reports from

principle is $p=\frac{n}{2}$. We show that the critical condition $c(x)\in

Laplacian. We replace the classical lower semi-continuous condition on
solutions for the fractional Laplacian with some integrability condition. Then

which involve solving an overdetermined system and eliminating bad data.
However, distribution networks are typically underdetermined due to the large
number of connection points and high cost of pervasive installation of
measurement devices. In this paper, we consider the recently proposed
state-estimation method for underdetermined systems that is based on matrix
completion. In particular, a constrained matrix completion algorithm was
proposed, wherein the standard matrix completion problem is augmented with
additional equality constraints representing the physics (namely power-flow
constraints). We analyze the sample complexity of this general method by
proving an upper bound on the sample complexity that depends directly on the
properties of these constraints that can lower number of needed samples as
compared to the unconstrained problem. To demonstrate the improvement that the
constraints add to distribution state estimation, we test the method on a
141-bus distribution network case study and compare it to the traditional least
squares minimization state estimation method.

the first attempt to solve this problem by proposing a multimodal skeleton
coding tool containing three different coding schemes, namely, spatial
differential-coding scheme, motionvector-based differential-coding scheme and
inter prediction scheme, thus utilizing both spatial and temporal redundancy to
losslessly compress skeleton data. More importantly, these schemes are switched
properly for different types of skeletons in video frames, hence achieving
further improvement of compression rate. Experimental results show that our
approach leads to 74.4% and 54.7% size reduction on our surveillance sequences
and overall test sequences respectively, which demonstrates the effectiveness

many-body quantum systems has attracted much recent interest, and simulations
of such systems in real quantum hardware are promising routes to demonstrating
a quantum advantage over classical machines. In these proposals, random noise
is an obstacle that must be overcome for a faithful simulation, and a single
error event can be enough to drive the system to a classically trivial state.
We argue that this need not always be the case, and consider a modification to
a leading quantum sampling problem-- time evolution in an interacting
Bose-Hubbard chain of transmon qubits [Neill et al, Science 2018] -- where each
site in the chain has a driven coupling to a lossy resonator and particle
number is no longer conserved. The resulting quantum dynamics are complex and
highly nontrivial. We argue that this problem is harder to simulate than the
isolated chain, and that it can achieve volume-law entanglement even in the
strong noise limit, likely persisting up to system sizes beyond the scope of
classical simulation. Further, we show that the metrics which suggest classical
intractability for the isolated chain point to similar conclusions in the noisy
case. These results suggest that quantum sampling problems including nontrivial
noise could be good candidates for demonstrating a quantum advantage in
near-term hardware.

level-$k$ Chern-Simons term. This analysis can be reliably carried out in the
large-$N$, fixed $N_f, k$ limit of the theory, up to certain assumptions that
we spell out explicitly. At leading order in the large-$N$ expansion we find
$N_f + 1$ distinct, exactly degenerate vacuum superselection sectors with
different patterns of flavor-symmetry breaking. The associated massless
Nambu-Goldstone bosons are generically accompanied by topological Chern-Simons
theories. This set of vacua contains many candidate phases previously proposed
for QCD$_3$. At subleading order in the large-$N$ expansion, the exact
degeneracy between the different superselection sectors is lifted, leading to a
multitude of metastable vacua. If we dial the quark masses, different
metastable vacua can become the true vacuum of the theory, leading to a
sequence of first-order phase transitions. This intricate large-$N$ dynamics
can be captured by the previously proposed bosonic dual theories for QCD$_3$,
provided these bosonic duals are furnished with a suitable scalar potential.
Interestingly, this potential must include terms beyond quartic order in the
scalar fields.

extending from the galactic plane vertically to the north at the eastern and
western sides of the galactic center, which are connected to each other at a
latitude of $1.2^{\circ}$ to form a loop-like structure as a whole. This
suggests that most of the radio continuum emission of the GCL is free-free
emission, and that the GCL is filled with thermal plasma. The east ridge of the
GCL observed with the radio recombination line separates 30 pc from the radio
arc, which has been considered as a part of the GCL, but coincides with a ridge
of the radio continuum at a galactic longitude of $0^{\circ}$. The radial
velocity of the radio recombination line is found to be between $-4$ and $+10$
km s$^{-1}$ across the GCL. This velocity is much smaller than the one expected
from the galactic rotation, and hence indicates that the GCL exists apart from
the galactic center. These characteristics of the GCL suggest that the
long-standing hypothesis that the GCL was created by an explosive activity in
the galactic center is unlikely, but favor that the GCL is a giant HII region.

using electron back-scattered diffraction technique. The first step requires
the establishment of the functional dependence of the indentation elastic
modulus given the lattice orientation and the intrinsic single crystal elastic
stiffness parameters. Previous efforts for this step required a large database
of computationally expensive finite element (FE) simulations in order to
establish this function with adequate accuracy. In this paper, it is shown that
the introduction of a Bayesian framework can greatly reduce the number of
simulations necessary to establish this function, while introducing practically
useful measures of uncertainty which can guide the selection of specific
additional simulations that are expected to best improve the predictive
accuracy of the function. The second step involves a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo
(MCMC) sampling of the distribution of possible values for the single crystal
elastic stiffness parameters based on a given set of experimentally measured
elastic indentation moduli in individual grains of different lattice
orientations. This second step is accomplished by calibrating the available
experimental data to the function established in the first step. This novel

framework, for finite volume discretisations of such models, in which internal
fluxes are not assumed to have a specific form, but only to satisfy some
(usual) coercivity and consistency properties. The oblique boundary conditions
are split into a normal component, which directly appears in the flux balance
on control volumes touching the domain boundary, and a tangential component
which is managed as an advection term on the boundary. This advection term is
discretised using a finite volume method based on a centred discretisation (to
ensure optimal rates of convergence) and stabilised using a vanishing boundary
viscosity. A convergence analysis, based on the 3rd Strang Lemma \cite{DPD18},
is conducted in this generic finite volume framework, and yields the expected
$\mathcal O(h)$ optimal convergence rate in discrete energy norm.
  We then describe a specific choice of numerical fluxes, based on a
generalised hexahedral meshing of the computational domain. These fluxes are a
corrected version of fluxes originally introduced in \cite{Medla.et.al2018}. We
identify mesh regularity parameters that ensure that these fluxes satisfy the
required coercivity and consistency properties. The theoretical rates of
convergence are illustrated by an extensive set of 3D numerical tests,

involving real-world data measuring the disturbing potential in Earth gravity

kilonova proved that neutron star mergers can synthesize large quantities of
r-process elements. If neutron star mergers in fact dominate all r-process
element production, then the distribution of kilonova ejecta compositions
should match the distribution of r-process abundance patterns observed in
stars. The lanthanide fraction (XLa) is a measurable quantity in both kilonovae
and metal-poor stars, but it has not previously been explicitly calculated for
stars. Here, we compute the lanthanide fraction distribution of metal-poor
stars ([Fe/H] < -2.5) to enable comparison to current and future kilonovae. The
full distribution peaks at log XLa ~ -1.8, but r-process-enhanced stars
([Eu/Fe] > 0.7) have distinctly higher lanthanide fractions; log XLa > -1.5. We
review observations of GW170817 and find general consensus that the total log
XLa = -2.2 +/- 0.5, somewhat lower than the typical metal-poor star and
inconsistent with the most highly r-enhanced stars. For neutron star mergers to
remain viable as the dominant r-process site, future kilonova observations
should be preferentially lanthanide-rich (including a population of ~10% with
log XLa > -1.5). These high-XLa kilonovae may be fainter and more rapidly
evolving than GW170817, posing a challenge for discovery and follow-up
observations. Both optical and (mid-)infrared observations will be required to
robustly constrain kilonova lanthanide fractions. If such high-XLa kilonovae
are not found in the next few years, that likely implies that the stars with
the highest r-process enhancements have a different origin for their r-process
elements.

found by many observational studies, the properties of the surrounding dust are
poorly understood. Using AKARI/IRC spectroscopy, we discover a new sample of a
heavily obscured AGN in LEDA 1712304 which shows a deep spectral absorption
feature due to silicate dust. Aims. We study the infrared (IR) spectral
properties of circumnuclear silicate dust in LEDA 1712304. Methods. We perform
IR spectral fitting, considering silicate dust properties such as composition,
porosity, size and crystallinity. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is
also performed to the flux densities in the UV to sub-millimeter range to
investigate the global spectral properties. Results. The best-fit model
indicates 0.1 $\mu$m-sized porous amorphous olivine (${\rm
Mg_{2x}Fe_{2-2x}SiO_4}$; $x=0.4$) with $4\%$ crystalline pyroxene. The optical
depth is $\tau_{\rm sil}{\sim}2.3$, while the total IR luminosity and stellar
mass are estimated to be $L_{\rm IR}=(5\pm1){\times}10^{10}\,L_{\odot}$ and
$M_{\rm star}=(2.7\pm0.8){\times}10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$, respectively. In such low
$L_{\rm IR}$ and $M_{\rm star}$ ranges, there are few galaxies which show that
large ${\tau}_{\rm sil}$. Conclusions. The silicate dust in the AGN torus of
LEDA 1712304 has properties notably similar to those in other AGNs as a whole,
but slightly different in the wing shape of the absorption profile. The
porosity of the silicate dust suggests dust coagulation or processing in the
circumnuclear environments, while the crystallinity suggests that the silicate
dust is relatively fresh.

prior of Edwards et al. (2019) in combination with Whittle's likelihood and
aims at reducing the high computational complexity of its posterior

Bernstein-Dirichlet process prior of Choudhuri et al. (2004) lies in its
ability to estimate spectral densities with sharp peaks and abrupt changes due
to the flexibility of B-splines with variable number and location of knots.
Here, we suggest to use P-splines of Eilers and Marx (1996) that combine a
B-spline basis with a discrete penalty on the basis coefficients. In addition
to equidistant knots, a novel strategy for a more expedient placement of knots
is proposed that makes use of the information provided by the periodogram about
the steepness of the spectral power distribution. We demonstrate in a
simulation study and two real case studies that this approach retains the
flexibility of the B-splines, achieves similar ability to accurately estimate
peaks due to the new data-driven knot allocation scheme but significantly
reduces the computational costs.

high-capacity quantum communications. Due to its turbulence-induced decoherence

Joule heating, reducing the aperture periodicity and blue-shifting the
transmission resonances of the device. When the voltage is removed, the wires
cool and elongate back to their original length, allowing the transmission
spectrum to return to its original state. The magnitude of this change depends
upon the applied voltage. The device is shown to thermally cycle between the

process yield transmission properties that are unexpected: two closely spaced
resonances, where both resonances correspond to the same scattering indices,
and an increase in the transmission amplitude of the lowest order resonance
upon contraction. We use numerical simulations to understand these features.

scenarios, where all categories are known beforehand. However, in practice,
recognition is essentially an open set problem. There are categories we know
called ""knowns"", and there are more we do not know called ""unknowns"".
Enumerating all categories beforehand is never possible, consequently it is
infeasible to prepare sufficient training samples for those unknowns. Applying
closed set recognition methods will naturally lead to unseen-category errors.
To address this problem, we propose the prototype based Open Deep Network
(P-ODN) for open set recognition tasks. Specifically, we introduce prototype
learning into open set recognition. Prototypes and prototype radiuses are
trained jointly to guide a CNN network to derive more discriminative features.
Then P-ODN detects the unknowns by applying a multi-class triplet thresholding
method based on the distance metric between features and prototypes. Manual
labeling the unknowns which are detected in the previous process as new
categories. Predictors for new categories are added to the classification layer
to ""open"" the deep neural networks to incorporate new categories dynamically.
The weights of new predictors are initialized exquisitely by applying a
distances based algorithm to transfer the learned knowledge. Consequently, this
initialization method speed up the fine-tuning process and reduce the samples
needed to train new predictors. Extensive experiments show that P-ODN can
effectively detect unknowns and needs only few samples with human intervention
to recognize a new category. In the real world scenarios, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the UCF11, UCF50, UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets.

only. It encompasses inpainting (generating a patch given its surrounding),
reverse inpainting/extrapolation (generating the periphery given the central

with adversarial training as well as perceptual and completion losses, and call
it the ``missing data encoder'' (MDE). We consider several configurations based
on how the seed fragments are chosen. We show that training MDE for ``random
extrapolation and colorization'' (MDE-REC), i.e. using random
channel-independent fragments, allows a better capture of the image semantics

loss, where the discriminator seeks the original non-masked regions, while the

p-modes in coronal loops are converted to sausage modes and transverse (kink)
modes, which are observed in the corona. Aims. We aim to investigate how those
wave modes are excited in the lower corona by photospheric acoustic waves.
Methods. We built 3D magnetohydrostatic loop systems with multiple inclinations
spanning from the photosphere to the lower corona. We then simulated these
atmospheres with the MANCHA code, in which we perturb the equilibrium with a
p-mode driver at the bottom of the domain. By splitting the velocity
perturbation into components longitudinal, normal, and azimuthal to the
magnetic flux surfaces we can study wave behavior. Results. In vertical flux
tubes, we find that deformed fast sausage surface waves and slow sausage body
waves are excited. In inclined flux tubes fast kink surface waves, slow sausage
body waves, and either a fast sausage surface wave or a plane wave are excited.
In addition, we calculate a wave conversion factor (0 $\le$ C $\le$ 1) from
acoustic to magnetic wave behavior by taking the ratio of the mean magnetic
energy flux to the sum of the mean magnetic and acoustic energy flux and
compare it to a commonly used theoretical conversion factor. We find that
between magnetic field inclinations of 10$^\circ$ to 30$^\circ$ those two
methods lie within 40%. For smaller inclinations the absolute deviation is
smaller than 0.1.

study the formation and decay of the induced mass-transport theoretically and

modified by the presence of a surface film. We infer the value of the

the correct ratio of amplitudes of horizontal and vertical velocities of the

that employs a dual-gated, dipolar antenna with a gap of 100 nm. This
narrow-gap antenna simultaneously creates a pn junction in a graphene channel
located above the antenna and strongly concentrates the incoming radiation at
this pn junction, where the photoresponse is created. We demonstrate that this
novel detector has an excellent sensitivity, with a noise-equivalent power of
80 pW-per-square-root-Hz at room temperature, a response time below 30 ns
(setup-limited), a high dynamic range (linear power dependence over more than 3
orders of magnitude) and broadband operation (measured range 1.8-4.2 THz,
antenna-limited), which fulfills a combination that is currently missing in the
state-of-the-art detectors. Importantly, on the basis of the agreement we
obtained between experiment, analytical model, and numerical simulations, we

towards this goal, all previous works have so far neglected the fact that in
many scenarios (like presidential elections) voting is actually a distributed

partitioned into disjoint districts and vote locally therein to elect local
winning alternatives using a voting rule; the final outcome is then chosen from
the set of these alternatives. We prove tight bounds on the distortion of
well-known voting rules for such distributed elections both from a worst-case
perspective as well as from a best-case one. Our results indicate that the
partition of voters into districts leads to considerably higher distortion, a
phenomenon which we also experimentally showcase using real-world data.

depending on the properties of a filter of a linear process under consideration
and on the parameter $b_n$ defining if the tapering is hard or soft, the limit

semantic segmentation tasks, they are usually trained by optimizing pixel-wise
losses such as cross-entropy. As a result, the predictions outputted by such
networks usually struggle to accurately capture the object boundaries and
exhibit holes inside the objects. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
improve the structure of the predicted segmentation masks. We introduce a novel
semantic edge detection network, which allows to match the predicted and ground
truth segmentation masks. This Semantic Edge-Aware strategy (SEMEDA) can be
combined with any backbone deep network in an end-to-end training framework.
Through thorough experimental validation on Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes
datasets, we show that the proposed SEMEDA approach enhances the structure of
the predicted segmentation masks by enforcing sharp boundaries and avoiding
discontinuities inside objects, improving the segmentation performance. In
addition, our semantic edge-aware loss can be integrated into any popular
segmentation network without requiring any additional annotation and with
negligible computational load, as compared to standard pixel-wise cross-entropy
loss.

the explosion of the ice mantles of dust grains. In this process, a build up of
chemical energy in the ice is released, sublimating the ices and producing a
short lived phase of high density, high temperature gas. The gas-grain chemical
code UCLCHEM has been modified to treat these explosions in order to model the
observed abundances of COMs towards the TMC-1 region. It is found that, based

and observables in the case of unitary invariant models are generalizations of
matrix traces. Some notable interactions in the literature include the melonic
ones, the tetrahedral one as well as the planar ones in rank three, or
necklaces in even ranks. Here we introduce generalized melonic interactions
which generalize the melonic and necklace interactions. We characterize them as
tree-like gluings of quartic interactions. We also completely characterize the
Feynman graphs which contribute to the large $N$ limit. For a subclass of
generalized melonic interactions called totally unbalanced interactions, we
prove that the large $N$ limit is Gaussian and therefore the Feynman graphs are
in bijection with trees. This result further extends the class of tensor models
which fall into the Gaussian universality class. Another key aspect of tensor
models with generalized melonic interactions is that they can be written as
matrix models without increasing the number of degrees of freedom of the
original tensor models. In the case of totally unbalanced interactions, this
new matrix model formulation in fact decreases the number of degrees of
freedom, meaning that some of the original degrees of freedom are effectively
integrated. We then show how the large $N$ Gaussian behavior can be reproduced

perceptions of problematic use with behavioral and demographic data, we
examined Facebook activities associated with problematic use as well as the

problematic are more likely to be younger, male, and going through a major life

night, and spend proportionally more time looking at profiles and less time
browsing their News Feeds. They also message their friends more frequently.
While they are more likely to respond to notifications, they are also more
likely to deactivate their accounts, perhaps in an effort to better manage
their time. Further, they are more likely to have seen content about social

site as more valuable to them, highlighting the complex relationship between

pole of toroidal coordinates is first established. It depends on the mass of
the shell, its main radius and axis-ratio $e$ (i.e. core-to-main radius ratio),
and involves the product of the complete elliptic integrals of the first and
second kinds. Next, we show that successive partial derivatives $\partial^{n

at that singular point, thereby enabling the expansion of the interior
potential as a bivariate series. Then, we have generated approximations at
orders $0$, $1$, $2$ and $3$, corresponding to increasing accuracy. Numerical
experiments confirm the great reliability of the approach, in particular for
small-to-moderate axis ratios ($e^2 \lesssim 0.1$ typically). In contrast with
the ellipsoidal case (Newton's theorem), the potential is not uniform inside
the shell cavity as a consequence of the curvature. We explain how to construct
the interior potential of toroidal shells with a thick edge (i.e. tubes), and
how a core stratification can be accounted for. This is a new step towards the
full description of the gravitating potential and forces of tori and rings.

Numerous theoretical studies have investigated how each of these types of
synapses contributes to the generation of neuronal oscillations, but their
combined effect is less understood. This limitation is further magnified by the
impossibility of traditional neuronal mean-field models ---also known as firing
rate models, or firing rate equations--- to account for electrical synapses.
Here we introduce a novel firing rate model that exactly describes the mean
field dynamics of heterogeneous populations of quadratic integrate-and-fire
(QIF) neurons with both chemical and electrical synapses. The mathematical
analysis of the firing rate model reveals a well-established bifurcation
scenario for networks with chemical synapses, characterized by a codimension-2
Cusp point and persistent states for strong recurrent excitatory coupling. The
inclusion of electrical coupling generally implies neuronal synchrony by virtue
of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. This transforms the Cusp scenario into a
bifurcation scenario characterized by three codimension-2 points (Cusp,
Takens-Bogdanov, and Saddle-Node Separatrix Loop), which greatly reduces the
possibility for persistent states. This is generic for heterogeneous QIF
networks with both chemical and electrical coupling. Our results agree with
several numerical studies on the dynamics of large networks of heterogeneous
spiking neurons with electrical and chemical coupling.

expression, changing some predefined attributes, or applying different filters.
However, users lack the flexibility of controlling the shapes of different

approach to compute a disentangled shape representation for a face image,
namely the FaceShapeGene. The proposed FaceShapeGene encodes the shape
information of each semantic facial part separately into a 1D latent vector. On
the basis of the FaceShapeGene, a novel part-wise face image editing system is
developed, which contains a shape-remix network and a conditional label-to-face
transformer. The shape-remix network can freely recombine the part-wise latent
vectors from different individuals, producing a remixed face shape in the form
of a label map, which contains the facial characteristics of multiple subjects.
The conditional label-to-face transformer, which is trained in an unsupervised
cyclic manner, performs part-wise face editing while preserving the original
identity of the subject. Experimental results on several tasks demonstrate that
the proposed FaceShapeGene representation correctly disentangles the shape
features of different semantic parts. %In addition, we test our system on
several novel part-wise face editing tasks. Comparisons to existing methods
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on accomplishing novel face
editing tasks.

thermocline by producing a combination of Langmuir circulation, internal waves
and turbulent shear flows, which interact over a wide range of time scales. Two
complementary approaches exist for approximating different aspects of WCI
dynamics. These are the Generalized Lagrangian Mean (GLM) approach and the
Gent--McWilliams (GM) approach. Their complementarity is evident in their
Kelvin circulation theorems. GLM introduces a wave pseudomomentum per unit mass
into its Kelvin circulation integrand, while GM introduces a an additional
`bolus velocity' to transport its Kelvin circulation loop. The GLM approach
models Eulerian momentum, while the GM approach models Lagrangian transport. In
principle, both GLM and GM are based on the Euler--Boussinesq (EB) equations
for an incompressible, stratified, rotating flow. The differences in their
Kelvin theorems arise from differences in how they model the flow map in the
Lagrangian for the Hamilton variational principle underlying the EB equations.
  A recently developed approach for uncertainty quantification in fluid
dynamics constrains fluid variational principles to require that Lagrangian
trajectories undergo Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport (SALT). Here we
introduce stochastic closure strategies for quantifying uncertainty in WCI by
adapting the SALT approach to both the GLM and GM approximations of the EB
variational principle. In the GLM framework, we introduce a stochastic group
velocity for transport of wave properties, relative to the frame of motion of
the Lagrangian mean flow velocity and a stochastic pressure contribution from
the fluctuating kinetic energy. In the GM framework we introduce a stochastic
bolus velocity in addition to the mean drift velocity by imposing the SALT
constraint in the GM variational principle.

different behaviour, we are able to partially characterize the relationship

encode the signal information remains elusive. Analyzing spike sequences
generated by individual neurons and by two coupled neurons (using the
stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo model), recent theoretical studies have found that
the relative timing of the spikes can encode the signal information. Using a
symbolic method to analyze the spike sequence, preferred and infrequent spike
patterns were detected, whose probabilities vary with both, the amplitude and
the frequency of the signal. To investigate if this encoding mechanism is
plausible also for neuronal ensembles, here we analyze the activity of a group
of neurons, when they all perceive a weak periodic signal. We find that, as in
the case of one or two coupled neurons, the probabilities of the spike
patterns, now computed from the spike sequences of all the neurons, depend on
the signal's amplitude and period, and thus, the patterns' probabilities encode
the information of the signal. We also find that the resonances with the period
of the signal or with the noise level are more pronounced when a group of
neurons perceive the signal, in comparison with when only one or two coupled
neurons perceive it. Neuronal coupling is beneficial for signal encoding as a
group of neurons is able to encode a small-amplitude signal, which could not be
encoded when it is perceived by just one or two coupled neurons. Interestingly,
we find that for a group of neurons, just a few connections with one another
can significantly improve the encoding of small-amplitude signals. Our findings
indicate that information encoding in preferred and infrequent spike patterns
is a plausible mechanism that can be employed by neuronal populations to encode
weak periodic inputs, exploiting the presence of neural noise.

of a generalized model, which includes the classical 'phase separation' and
'mass action' models as special cases. The generalized model describes
spherocylindrical micelles, which are simultaneously multicomponent and
polydisperse in size. Theory: By analytical minimization of the free-energy
functional we derived explicit expressions for the chain-extension and
chain-end distribution functions in the hydrocarbon core of mixed micelles from
two surfactants of different chainlengths. Findings: The hydrocarbon core of a
two-component micelle is divided in two regions, outer and inner, where the
ends of the shorter and longer chains are located. The derived analytical
expression for the chain-conformation free energy implies that the mixing of
surfactants with different chainlengths is always nonideal and synergistic,
i.e. it leads to decrease of the micellar free energy and to enhancement of
micellization and micelle growth. The derived expressions are applicable to
surfactants with different headgroups (nonionic, ionic, zwitterionic) and to
micelles of different shapes (spherical, wormlike, lamellar). The results can
be incorporated in a quantitative theory of the growth of giant mixed micelles
in formulations with practical applications in detergency.

feasible to determine the $\alpha$-author at the time of the paper's

where the substitution of nonmagnetic Ti$^{4+}$ (3$d^0$) for Ir$^{4+}$ (5$d^5$)
amounts to dilution of magnetic network and tuning of these parameters in
opposite way. The system retains its original structural symmetry but local
structural parameters show an evolution with Ti content. While the magnetic
transition temperature is not largely influenced, both magnetic moment and
magnetic frustration decreases with Ti doping. Magnetic relaxation measurement
shows the parent compound Y$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ as well as its Ti doped analogues
are in nonequilibrium magnetic state where the magnetic relaxation rate
increases with Ti. Temperature dependent Raman measurements indicate no changes
in structural symmetry, however, across the magnetic transition temperature an
anomaly in A$_{1g}$ Raman mode is observed. Temperature dependent x-ray
diffraction data also support the Raman spectroscopy data, however, an
evolution of lattice parameters with temperature is observed. The electrical
resistivity data of Y$_2$(Ir$_{1-x}$Ti$_{x}$)$_2$O$_7$ series exhibits
insulating behavior throughout the temperature range, however, the resistivity
decreases with Ti doping. The nature of charge conduction is found to follow
power-law behavior in whole series but the validity of this model varies with
temperature. A negative magnetoresistance has been observed at low temperature
in present series which is explained with weak localized mechanism. Similar to
other Ir based oxides, a crossover from negative to positive MR has been
observed in present system.

pollution, socio-spatial inequalities, environmental and sustainability issues.
Modelling the structure and evolution of cities is therefore critical because
policy makers need robust theories and new paradigms for mitigating these
problems. Fortunately, the increased data available about urban systems opens
the possibility of constructing a quantitative 'science of cities', with the
aim of identifying and modelling essential phenomena. Statistical physics plays
a major role in this effort by bringing tools and concepts able to bridge
theory and empirical results. This article illustrates this point by focusing
on fundamental objects in cities: the distribution of the urban population;
segregation phenomena and spin-like models; the polycentric transition of the
activity organization; energy considerations about mobility and models inspired
by gravity and radiation concepts; CO2 emitted by transport; and finally,
scaling that describes how various socio-economical and infrastructures evolve
when cities grow.

disappeared with the onset of an X-ray burst, similar to what was reported in

was in a soft spectral state when it exhibited the QPOs. This makes EXO
0748--676 the sixth source with mHz oscillations associated to marginally
stable burning, and the second one that shows a systematic frequency drift. Our

aim is to investigate the morphology and dynamics of the gas inside the central
kpc, and to probe nuclear fueling and feedback phenomena. The morphology of
CO(3-2) line emission reveals a 2-arm trailing nuclear spiral at
$r\lesssim$100pc and a circumnuclear ring at ~350pc radius, that is coincident
with the star-forming ring seen in the optical images. The molecular gas in the
galaxy disk is in a remarkably regular rotation, however, the kinematics in the
nuclear region is very skewed. The nuclear spectrum of CO and dense gas tracers
HCN(4-3), HCO+(4-3), and CS(7-6) show broad wings up to $\pm$300km/s,
associated with a molecular outflow emanating from the nucleus (r~25pc). We
derive a molecular outflow mass $M_{out}$=2x10$^6$M$_\odot$ and a mass outflow
rate of $\dot{M}_{out}=$27$\rm M_\odot yr^{-1}$. The molecular outflow
energetics exceed the values predicted by AGN feedback models: the kinetic
power of the outflow corresponds to 20%L_AGN and the momentum rate is
$\dot{M}_{out}v\sim400L_{AGN}/c$. The outflow is mainly boosted by the AGN
through entrainment by the radio jet, but given the weak nuclear activity of
NGC613, we might be witnessing a fossil outflow, resulted from a strong past
AGN that now has already faded. The nuclear trailing spiral observed in CO
emission is inside the ILR ring of the bar. We compute the gravitational
torques exerted in the gas to estimate the efficiency of the angular momentum
exchange. The gravity torques are negative from 25 to 100pc and the gas loses
its angular momentum in a rotation period, providing evidence of a highly
efficient inflow towards the center. This phenomenon shows that the massive
central black hole has a significant dynamical influence on the gas, triggering
its fueling.

have been proposed to express and enforce application semantics. One of these
extensions is that of order dependencies (ODs), which express rules involving
order. The article entitled ""Discovering Order Dependencies through Order
Compatibility"" by Consonni et al., published in the EDBT conference proceedings
in March 2019, investigates the OD discovery problem. They claim to prove that
their OD discovery algorithm, OCDDISCOVER, is complete, as well as being
significantly more efficient in practice than the state-of-the-art. They
further claim that the implementation of the existing FASTOD algorithm
(ours)-we shared our code base with the authors-which they benchmark against is
flawed, as OCDDISCOVER and FASTOD report different sets of ODs over the same
data sets.
  In this rebuttal, we show that their claim of completeness is, in fact, not
true. Built upon their incorrect claim, OCDDISCOVER's pruning rules are overly
aggressive, and prune parts of the search space that contain legitimate ODs.
This is the reason their approach appears to be ""faster"" in practice. Finally,
we show that Consonni et al. misinterpret our set-based canonical form for ODs,
leading to an incorrect claim that our FASTOD implementation has an error.

The most famous consequence of this phenomenon is superradiance. Beyond that,
the thermodynamic effects on the system of these bath-induced coherences have
been mostly unexplored. We show here, for a simple and common system (a pair of
two-level systems), that the energetic and entropic impacts can indeed be
dramatic and diverse, including amplification of the action of the bath but
also its mitigation. Our results can be tested experimentally. They suggest
that bath-induced coherences can be harnessed to enhance thermodynamic tasks,

considered. Therefore, our system is a possible setup for the implementation of
a phononic circuit. Motivated by recent developments on the usage of BECs as

Dynamically, most open clusters should dissolve on shorter timescales, of ~ 1
Gyr. Having survived until now, NGC 2682 was likely much more massive in the
past, and is bound to have an interesting dynamical history. Aims: We
investigate the spatial distribution of NGC 2682 stars to constrain its
dynamical evolution, especially focusing on the marginally bound stars in the
cluster outskirts. Methods: We use Gaia DR2 data to identify NGC 2682 members
up to a distance of ~150 pc (10 degrees). Two methods (Clusterix and UPMASK)
are applied to this end. We estimate distances to obtain three-dimensional
stellar positions using a Bayesian approach to parallax inversion, with an
appropriate prior for star clusters. We calculate the orbit of NGC 2682 using
the GRAVPOT16 software. Results: The cluster extends up to 200 arcmin (50 pc)
which implies that its size is at least twice as previously believed. This
exceeds the cluster Hill sphere based on the Galactic potential at the distance
of NGC 2682. Conclusions: The extra-tidal stars in NGC 2682 may originate from
external perturbations such as disk shocking or dynamical evaporation from
two-body relaxation. The former origin is plausible given the orbit of NGC
2682, which crossed the Galactic disk ~40 Myr ago.

show that in the inner regions of the bulge the MDF is skewed to higher

minimal at a characteristic mass $M^{\star}$ of ${\rm 10^{9.5}}$ ${\rm

that the diversity of SFHs increases towards both at the low- and high-mass

the ${\rm \sigma_{\text{sSFR}}}$ for high mass objects. On the other hand, we
suggest that SNe feedback increases the ${\rm \sigma_{\text{sSFR}}}$ of

variables is a crucial matter in many research fields. The established measure
for quantifying such relations is the mutual information. However, estimating
mutual information from limited samples is a challenging task. Since the mutual
information is the difference of two entropies, the existing Bayesian
estimators of entropy may be used to estimate information. This procedure,
however, is still biased in the severely under-sampled regime. Here we propose
an alternative estimator that is applicable to those cases in which the
marginal distribution of one of the two variables---the one with minimal
entropy---is well sampled. The other variable, as well as the joint and
conditional distributions, can be severely undersampled. We obtain an estimator
that presents very low bias, outperforming previous methods even when the
sampled data contain few coincidences. As with other Bayesian estimators, our
proposal focuses on the strength of the interaction between two discrete
variables, without seeking to model the specific way in which the variables are
related. A distinctive property of our method is that the main data statistics
determining the amount of mutual information is the inhomogeneity of the
conditional distribution of the low-entropy variable in those states (typically
few) in which the large-entropy variable registers coincidences.

velocity stratification, as well as their magnetic field configuration. We find
average temperature enhancements of a few thousand kelvin close to the
classical temperature minimum, but localised peak temperatures of up to
10,000-15,000 K from Ca II inversions. Including Mg II generally dampens these
temperature enhancements to below 8000 K, while Si IV requires temperatures in
excess of 10,000 K at low heights, but may also be reproduced with secondary
temperature enhancements of 35,000-60,000 K higher up. However, reproducing Si
IV comes at the expense of overestimating the Mg II emission. The line-of-sight
velocity maps show clear bi-directional jet signatures and strong correlation
with substructure in the intensity images, with slightly larger velocities
towards the observer than away. The magnetic field parameters show an
enhancement of the horizontal field co-located with the brightenings at similar
heights as the temperature increase. We are thus able to largely reproduce the
observational properties of Ellerman bombs with UV burst signature with
temperature stratifications peaking close to the classical temperature minimum.
Correctly modelling the Si IV emission in agreement with all other diagnostics
is, however, an outstanding issue. Accounting for resolution differences,
fitting localised temperature enhancements and/or performing spatially-coupled
inversions is likely necessary to obtain better agreement between all
considered diagnostics.

the growth of the mean squared displacement (MSD) with time has an exponent
different from one. We show that recurrent neural networks (RNN) can
efficiently characterize anomalous diffusion by determining the exponent from a
single short trajectory, outperforming the standard estimation based on the MSD
when the available data points are limited, as is often the case in
experiments. Furthermore, the RNN can handle more complex tasks where there are
no standard approaches, such as determining the anomalous diffusion exponent
from a trajectory sampled at irregular times, and estimating the switching time
and anomalous diffusion exponents of an intermittent system that switches
between different kinds of anomalous diffusion. We validate our method on
experimental data obtained from sub-diffusive colloids trapped in speckle light

to quasars (zabs~zem) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 14.
The search is based on the Lyman-Werner band signature of damped H2 absorption
lines without any prior on the associated metal or neutral hydrogen content.
This has resulted in the detection of 81 systems with log N(H2)~19-20 located
within a few thousand km/s from the quasar. Compared to a control sample of
intervening systems, this implies an excess of proximate H2 systems by about a
factor of 4 to 5. The incidence of H2 systems increases steeply with decreasing
relative velocity, reaching an order of magnitude higher than expected from
intervening statistics at Delta_v<1000 km/s. The most striking feature of the
proximate systems compared to the intervening ones is the presence of Ly-alpha
emission in the core of the associated damped HI absorption line in about half
of the sample. This puts constraints on the relative projected sizes of the
absorbing clouds to those of the quasar line emitting regions. Using the SDSS
spectra, we estimate the HI, metal and dust content of the systems, which are
found to have typical metallicities of one tenth Solar, albeit with a large
spread among individual systems. We observe trends between the fraction of
leaking Ly-alpha emission and the relative absorber-quasar velocity as well as
with the excitation of several metal species, similar to what has been seen in
metal-selected proximate DLAs. With the help of theoretical HI-H2 transition
relations, we show that the presence of H2 helps to break the degeneracy
between density and strength of the UV field as main sources of excitation and
hence provides unique constraints on the possible origin and location of the
absorbing clouds. We suggest that most of these systems originate from galaxies
in the quasar group. [truncated]

We calculate the geodesic length on the associated group manifold of gate

the complexity in the excited states. Although the gate matrix is very large we
can transform it to a diagonal matrix and obtain the associated complexity. We
explicitly calculate the complexity in several excited states and prove that
the square of geodesic length in the general state $|{\rm n,m}\rangle$ is

cell-cell communication affects noise in biochemical networks that arises from
both intrinsic and extrinsic sources. We derive a system of approximate
differential equations that captures lower-order moments of a population of
cells, which communicate by secreting and sensing a diffusing molecule. Since
the number of obtained equations grows combinatorially with number of
considered cells, we employ a previously proposed model reduction technique,
which exploits symmetries in the underlying moment dynamics. Importantly, the
number of equations obtained in this way is independent of the number of
considered cells such that the method scales to arbitrary population sizes.
Based on this approach, we study how cell-cell communication affects population
variability in several biochemical networks. Moreover, we analyze the accuracy
and computational efficiency of the moment-based approximation by comparing it
with moments obtained from stochastic simulations.

reducing dimensions and extracting relevant information. The spectrum of
covariance matrices from power data exhibits two aspects: 1) bulk, which arises
from random noise or fluctuations and 2) spikes, which represents factors
caused by anomaly events. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the
estimation of high-dimensional factor models, minimizing the distance between
the empirical spectral density (ESD) of covariance matrices of the residuals of
power data that are obtained by subtracting principal components and the
limiting spectral density (LSD) from a multiplicative covariance structure
model. The free probability theory (FPT) is used to derive the spectral density
of the multiplicative covariance model, which efficiently solves the
computational difficulties. The proposed approach connects the estimation of
the number of factors to the LSD of covariance matrices of the residuals, which
provides estimators of the number of factors and the correlation structure
information in the residuals. Considering a lot of measurement noise is
contained in the power data and the correlation structure is complex for the
residuals, the approach prefers approaching the ESD of covariance matrices of
the residuals through a multiplicative covariance model, which avoids making
crude assumptions or simplifications on the complex structure of the data.
Theoretical studies show the proposed approach is robust against noise and
sensitive to the presence of weak factors. The synthetic data from IEEE 118-bus
power system is used to validate the effectiveness of the approach.
Furthermore, the application to the analysis of the real-world online
monitoring data in a power grid shows that the estimators in the approach can
be used to indicate the system behavior.

impossible to study in a randomized trial, clinical disease registries also
require special care and attention in causal inference. Registry data may be
incomplete, inconsistent, and subject to confounding. In this paper we aim to
address several analytical issues in estimating treatment effects that plague
clinical registries such as the Emory amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
Clinic Registry. When attempting to assess the effect of a surgical insertion
of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube on body mass index (BMI)
using the data from the ALS Clinic Registry, one must combat issues of
confounding, censoring by death, and missing outcome data that have not been
addressed in previous studies of PEG. We propose a causal inference framework
for estimating the survivor average causal effect (SACE) of PEG, which
incorporates a model for generalized propensity scores to correct for
confounding by pre-treatment variables, a model for principal stratification to
account for censoring by death, and a model for the missing data mechanism.
Applying the proposed framework to the ALS Clinic Registry Data, our analysis
shows that PEG has a positive SACE on BMI at month 18 post-baseline; our
results likely offer more definitive answers regarding the effect of PEG than
previous studies of PEG.

oceanic currents, particularly by eddies (vortices) formed by the hydrodynamic
flow field. Employing a kinematic flow field coupled to a population dynamical
model for plankton growth, we study the impact of an intermittent upwelling of
nutrients on triggering harmful algal blooms (HABs). Though it is widely
believed that additional nutrients boost the formation of HABs or algal blooms
in general, we show that the response of the plankton to nutrient plumes
depends crucially on the mesoscale hydrodynamic flow structure. In general
nutrients can either be quickly washed out from the observation area, or can be
captured by the vortices in the flow. The occurrence of either scenario depends
on the relation between the time scales of the vortex formation and nutrient
upwelling as well as the time instants at which upwelling pulse occurs and how
long do they last. We show that these two scenarios result in very different
responses in plankton dynamics which makes it very difficult to predict,
whether nutrient upwelling will lead to a HAB or not. This explains, why
observational data are sometimes inconclusive establishing a correlation
between upwelling events and plankton blooms.

We study the situation where the fire must be contained in the upper $L_1$

represents a challenge for mesoscopic systems. In this paper, we explicitly
show how to build these finite-time adiabatic processes for an overdamped
Brownian particle in an arbitrary potential, a system that is relevant both at
the conceptual and the practical level. This is achieved by jointly engineering
the time evolutions of the binding potential and the fluid temperature.
Moreover, we prove that the second principle imposes a speed limit for such
adiabatic transformations: there appears a minimum time to connect the initial
and final states. This minimum time can be explicitly calculated for a general
compression/decompression situation.

transformed in certain ways, the function they learn transforms in a
predictable manner. Here we formalize this notion using concepts from the

learning algorithm possesses are formalized by categories of predictor and
target spaces, whose morphisms represent the algorithm's invariances, and an
index category whose morphisms represent permutations of the training examples.
An invariant learning algorithm is a natural transformation between two
functors from the product of these categories to the category of sets,

illustrate the framework by characterizing and contrasting the invariances of

matter density, velocity and gravitational fields in the Universe as a function
of time. Typically, calculations are restricted to equal time correlations,
where any given fields are evaluated at the same redshift. For some
applications, it is necessary to make accurate predictions of unequal time
correlators, where the fields considered are evaluated at different redshifts.
In this work, we show that the Zeldovich approximation provides an accurate
(<10%) analytical prescription to model unequal time correlators, which we
validate against numerical N-body simulations. The Zeldovich approximation
introduces a scale-dependent exponential suppression of unequal time
correlators, which depends on cosmology and the redshifts of the fields
considered. Comparing the Zeldovich case to previous approximations, we show
that it can yield accurate predictions for wavenumbers that extend well into
the nonlinear regime. However, we also show that correlations over such scales
are typically suppressed by the geometry of the lightcone, and thus should
normally be negligible for cosmology with galaxy surveys. We discuss potential
exceptions, such as intrinsic galaxy alignments, where unequal time correlators
could play a role in the modeling of the observables.

Enhancing static analyses with dynamic information is a common pattern, with

dynamic behavior, due to native code, unsupported features (e.g., invokedynamic
or lambdas in Java), and more. We present techniques that substantially
counteract the unsoundness of a static analysis, with virtually no intrusion to
the analysis logic. Our approach is reified in the HeapDL toolchain and
consists in taking whole-heap snapshots during program execution, that are
further enriched to capture significant aspects of dynamic behavior, regardless
of the causes of such behavior. The snapshots are then used as extra inputs to
the static analysis. The approach exhibits both portability and significantly
increased coverage. Heap information under one set of dynamic inputs allows a
static analysis to cover many more behaviors under other inputs. A
HeapDL-enhanced static analysis of the DaCapo benchmarks computes 99.5%
(median) of the call-graph edges of unseen dynamic executions (vs. 76.9% for
the Tamiflex tool).

exoplanets that tend to orbit hot, early type stars - termed ultra-hot
Jupiters. The severe stellar irradiation heats their atmospheres to
temperatures of $\sim 4,000$ K, similar to the photospheres of dwarf stars. Due
to the absence of aerosols and complex molecular chemistry at such
temperatures, these planets offer the potential of detailed chemical
characterisation through transit and day-side spectroscopy. Studies of their
chemical inventories may provide crucial constraints on their formation process
and evolution history.
  Aims: To search the optical transmission spectrum of KELT-9 b for absorption
lines by metals using the cross-correlation technique.
  Methods: We analyse 2 transits observed with the HARPS-N spectrograph. We use
an isothermal equilibrium chemistry model to predict the transmission spectrum
for each of the neutral and singly-ionized atoms with atomic numbers between 3
and 78. Of these, we identify the elements that are expected to have spectral
lines in the visible wavelength range and use those as cross-correlation
templates.
  Results: We detect absorption of Na I, Cr II, Sc II and Y II, and confirm
previous detections of Mg I, Fe I, Fe II and Ti II. In addition, we find
evidence of Ca I, Cr I, Co I, and Sr II that will require further observations
to verify. The detected absorption lines are significantly deeper than model
predictions, suggesting that material is transported to higher altitudes where
the density is enhanced compared to a hydrostatic profile. There appears to be
no significant blue-shift of the absorption spectrum due to a net day-to-night
side wind. In particular, the strong Fe II feature is shifted by $0.18 \pm
0.27$ km~s$^{-1}$, consistent with zero. Using the orbital velocity of the

study the joint impact of stochastic capacity and spillback on the long-time

queueing links in series. The upstream link has a constant capacity (saturation
rate) and an infinite buffer size. The downstream link has a stochastic
capacity and a finite buffer size. Queue spillback occurs when the the
downstream link is full. We derive a necessary condition and a sufficient
condition for the total queue length to be bounded on average. The necessary
(resp. sufficient) condition leads to an upper (resp. lower) bound for the
throughput of the two-link system. Using our results, we analyze the
sensitivity of throughput of the two-link system with respect to the frequency

discuss how our analysis can be extended to feedback-controlled systems and to

refine the hard example mining to improve the exploration efficacy in person
re-identification. It is motivated by following observation: the more
attributes some people share, the more difficult to separate their identities.
Based on this observation, we develop HPIM via a transferred attribute
describer, a deep multi-attribute classifier trained from the source noisy
person attribute datasets. We encode each image into the attribute
probabilistic description in the target person re-ID dataset. Afterwards in the
attribute code space, we consider each person as a distribution to generate his
view-specific attribute codes in different practical scenarios. Hence we
estimate the person-specific statistical moments from zeroth to higher order,
which are further used to calculate the central moment discrepancies between
persons. Such discrepancy is a ground to choose hard identity to organize
proper mini-batches, without concerning the person representation changing in
metric learning. It presents as a complementary tool of hard example mining,
which helps to explore the global instead of the local hard example constraint
in the mini-batch built by randomly sampled identities. Extensive experiments
on two person re-identification benchmarks validated the effectiveness of our
proposed algorithm.

with entanglement assistance in the one-shot setting. The protocols achieving
the best compression use many more qubits of shared entanglement than the
number of qubits in the states in the ensemble. Other compression protocols,
with potentially larger communication cost, have entanglement cost bounded by
the number of qubits in the given states. This motivates the question as to
whether entanglement is truly necessary for compression, and if so, how much of
it is needed.
  Motivated by questions in communication complexity, we lift certain
restrictions that are placed on compression protocols in tasks such as
state-splitting and channel simulation. We show that an ensemble of the form
designed by Jain, Radhakrishnan, and Sen (ICALP'03) saturates the known bounds
on the sum of communication and entanglement costs, even with the relaxed
compression protocols we study.
  The ensemble and the associated one-way communication protocol have several
remarkable properties. The ensemble is incompressible by more than a constant
number of qubits without shared entanglement, even when constant error is
allowed. Moreover, in the presence of shared entanglement, the communication
cost of compression can be arbitrarily smaller than the entanglement cost. The
quantum information cost of the protocol can thus be arbitrarily smaller than
the cost of compression without shared entanglement. The ensemble can also be
used to show the impossibility of reducing, via compression, the shared
entanglement used in two-party protocols for computing Boolean functions.

ultraviolet spectral data of the umbral flare brightenings, which provide new
challenges for radiative-hydrodynamic modeling of the chromospheric velocity
field and the white-light continuum radiation. The emission line profiles in
the umbral flare brightenings exhibit redshifts and profile asymmetries, but
these are significantly smaller than in another, well-studied X-class solar
flare. We present a ratio of the NUV continuum intensity to the Fe II 2814.45
Ang intensity. This continuum-to-line ratio is a new spectral diagnostic of
significant heating at high column mass (log $m/$[g cm$^{-2}] >-2$) during
solar flares because the continuum and emission line radiation originate from
relatively similar temperatures but moderately different optical depths. The
full spectral readout of these IRIS data also allow for a comprehensive survey
of the flaring NUV landscape: in addition to many lines of Fe II and Cr II, we
identify a new solar flare emission line, He I $\lambda2829.91$ (as previously
identified in laboratory and early-type stellar spectra). The Fermi/GBM hard
X-ray data provide inputs to radiative-hydrodynamic models (which will be

  in Reaction Flows 2019, 2 pages, 2 figures",,,,"math.DG math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The identification of slow invariant manifolds (SIMs) is an essential part in
model-order reduction for reactive systems. The mathematical definition of the
SIM by Fenichel can be considered unsatisfactory, because it is only applicable
to so-called slow-fast system and does not provide the uniqueness of the SIM.
Observing the phase space of the dynamical system (not necessarily a slow-fast
system), the SIM becomes a geometric object which attracts trajectories,
resulting in a bundling behavior. We aim to find a more general definition of
the SIM, guided by the prior observations in phase space within the field of
differential geometry. This setting provides one major benefit: All quantities
are formulated covariantly, i.e. they are independent of the coordinate choice.
A recent work by Heiter and Lebiedz \cite{heiter} translates the invariance
property to vanishing sectional curvatures in the extended phase space.

First, we reconstruct spectral CT image from projections and calculate material

reconstruction results. Second, we employ the direct inversion (DI) method to
obtain initial material decomposition results, and a set of image patches are
extracted from the mode-1 unfolding of normalized material image tensor to
train a united dictionary by the K-SVD technique. Third, the trained dictionary
is employed to explore the similarities from decomposed material images by
constructing the DLIMD model. Fourth, more constraints (i.e., volume
conservation and the bounds of each pixel within material maps) are further
integrated into the model to improve the accuracy of material decomposition.
Finally, both physical phantom and preclinical experiments are employed to
evaluate the performance of the proposed DLIMD in material decomposition
accuracy, material image edge preservation and feature recovery.

distributions from microscopic approaches incorporating one or several of the
resonance decay mechanisms allows conclusions on the source of the fine
structure. For the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance (ISGQR), spreading
through the first step of the doorway mechanism, i.e.\ coupling between one
particle-one hole ($1p1h$) and two particle-two hole ($2p2h$) states is
identified as the relevant mechanism. In heavy nuclei it is dominated by
coupling to low-lying surface vibrations, while in lighter nuclei stochastic
coupling becomes increasingly important. The fine structure observed for the
isovector giant dipole resonance (IVGDR) arises mainly from the fragmentation
of the $1p1h$ strength (Landau damping), although some indications for the
relevance of the spreading width are also found.

in proton-lead collisions with center of mass energy per nucleon pair 5.02 TeV.
In the low $p_{\rm T}$ region with $p_{\rm{T}}\leq $ 3.9 (3.1, 2.5, 2.7, 2.4

in the pion (kaon, proton, ${\rm \Lambda}$, ${\rm \Xi}$ and ${\rm \Omega}$)
spectra when a dilatation, $p_{\rm T}\rightarrow p_{\rm T}/K$, is applied. Here
$K$ is a scaling parameter depending on the centrality class. We find that the
rates at which ln$K$ changes with the logarithmic value of the average value of
the number of participating nucleons, ln$\langle N_{\rm{part}}\rangle$, are
stronger for baryons than those for mesons. In the high $p_{\rm T}$ region,
there is a deviation from the scaling. The more peripheral the collisions are,
the more obvious the violation of the scaling is. In the framework of the
colour string percolation (CSP) model, we show that mesons and baryons are
generated from the decay of clusters formed by strings overlapping in the
transverse plane with the same size dispersion but with different mean size.
The mean size of clusters for baryons is smaller than that of mesons. For the
same hadrons at different centrality classes, the mean size of clusters
decreases with the increase of centrality. The fragmentation functions for
cluster decay are different for different hadrons, while they are universal for
the same hadrons at different centrality classes. The universal scaling of the
meson and baryon spectra in the low $p_{\rm T}$ region can be quantitatively
understood with the CSP model at the same time.

studied numerically using higher-order spacing ratios. For given $m$ and the
Dyson index $\beta$, the modified index $\beta'$ is tabulated whose nearest
neighbor spacing distribution is identical to that of $k$-th order spacing

following: separable pairs led to the most accurate answers and the shortest
task execution time, while integral dimensions were among the least accurate;
it achieved high performance only when a pop-out separable feature (here color)

approach, which can generate new labeled data based on existing data using
label-preserving transformations. Although we can benefit a lot from DA,
designing appropriate DA policies requires a lot of expert experience and time
consumption, and the evaluation of searching the optimal policies is costly. So
we raise a new question in this paper: how to achieve automated data
augmentation at as low cost as possible? We propose a method named BO-Aug for

optimization approach. Our method can find the optimal policies at a relatively
low search cost, and the searched policies based on a specific dataset are
transferable across different neural network architectures or even different

gravity, where the only allowed values of the quantum numbers $j_p$ at the
punctures of the spin network on the spacelike two-surfaces of spacetime are
$0$ and $\frac{1}{2}$. When $j_p=0$, the puncture is in the vacuum, and it does
not contribute to the area of the two-surface, whereas when $j_p=\frac{1}{2}$,
the puncture is in an excited state, and the allowed values of the associated
quantum number $m_p$ are $-\frac{1}{2}$ and $+\frac{1}{2}$. As a consequence,
the spin network used as a model of spacetime is analogous to a system of
particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$, and every puncture carries exactly one bit
of information. When applied to spacetimes with horizon our model enables us to
find an explicit expression for the partition function of spacetime. Using this
partition function we may, among other things, obtain the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy law for black holes. When applied to cosmological models with horizon
the partition function predicts a cosmic phase transition in the early
Universe, where the cosmological constant went through a dramatic decrease and
the matter of the Universe was created out of the vacuum.

framework for tactical decision making, which combines the concepts of planning
and learning, in the form of Monte Carlo tree search and deep reinforcement
learning. The method is based on the AlphaGo Zero algorithm, which is extended
to a domain with a continuous state space where self-play cannot be used. The
framework is applied to two different highway driving cases in a simulated
environment and it is shown to perform better than a commonly used baseline
method. The strength of combining planning and learning is also illustrated by
a comparison to using the Monte Carlo tree search or the neural network policy
separately.

platforms that contain implicit data as users' browsing, purchasing and
streaming history. One common approach consists in selecting the N most
relevant items to each user, for a given N, which is called top-N
recommendation. To do so, recommender systems rely on various kinds of
information, like item and user features, past interest of users for items,
browsing history and trust between users. However, they often use only one or
two such pieces of information, which limits their performance. In this paper,
we design and implement GraFC2T2, a general graph-based framework to easily
combine and compare various kinds of side information for top-N recommendation.
It encodes content-based features, temporal and trust information into a
complex graph, and uses personalized PageRank on this graph to perform
recommendation. We conduct experiments on Epinions and Ciao datasets, and
compare obtained performances using F1-score, Hit ratio and MAP evaluation
metrics, to systems based on matrix factorization and deep learning. This shows
that our framework is convenient for such explorations, and that combining
different kinds of information indeed improves recommendation in general.

simulated using the Pseudo-Spring Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) in two

material damage. Here, the interaction of particles is limited to its initial
immediate neighbours. The particles are connected via springs. These springs do
not provide any extra stiffness in the system but only define the level of
interaction between the connecting pairs. It is assumed that a crack has passed
through a spring connecting a particle pair if the damage indicator of that
spring becomes more than a predefined value. The crack branching of a
pre-notched plate under dynamic loading and the effect of loading amplitude are
studied here. The computed crack speeds, crack paths and surfaces are compared
with experimental and numerical results available in the literature and are
found to be in good agreement. The effect of notch location for a plate with a
circular hole is studied here. The ability of the framework to model arbitrary
crack paths and surfaces are demonstrated via three-dimensional simulations of

expression is formed for its solution. The antennas are simulated by method of
moments and the solution is formulated both for structures fed by discrete
ports, as well as for design regions characterized by an equivalent current. It
is shown that the solution is solely dependent on the eigenvalues of the
so-called energy modes of the antenna. The magnitude of these eigenvalues is
analyzed for a linear dipole array as well as a plate with embedded antenna

and enables faster design space exploration at a higher abstraction level.
Optimization of complex applications in HLS is challenging due to the effects
of implementation issues such as routing congestion. Routing congestion
estimation is absent or inaccurate in existing HLS design methods and tools.
Early and accurate congestion estimation is of great benefit to guide the
optimization in HLS and improve the efficiency of implementation. However,
routability, a serious concern in FPGA designs, has been difficult to evaluate
in HLS without analyzing post-implementation details after Place and Route. To
this end, we propose a novel method to predict routing congestion in HLS using
machine learning and map the expected congested regions in the design to the
relevant high-level source code. This is greatly beneficial in early
identification of routability oriented bottlenecks in the high-level source
code without running time-consuming register-transfer level (RTL)
implementation flow. Experiments demonstrate that our approach accurately
estimates vertical and horizontal routing congestion with errors of 6.71% and
10.05% respectively. By presenting Face Detection application as a case study,
we show that by discovering the bottlenecks in high-level source code, routing
congestion can be easily and quickly resolved compared to the efforts involved
in RTL implementation and design feedback.

various types of component failures, which can be all encompassed within the
spectrum of a Byzantine behavior. Several approaches have been proposed
recently to tolerate Byzantine workers. Yet all require trusting a central
parameter server. We initiate in this paper the study of the ``general''
Byzantine-resilient distributed machine learning problem where no individual
component is trusted.
  We show that this problem can be solved in an asynchronous system, despite
the presence of $\frac{1}{3}$ Byzantine parameter servers and $\frac{1}{3}$
Byzantine workers (which is optimal). We present a new algorithm, ByzSGD, which
solves the general Byzantine-resilient distributed machine learning problem by
relying on three major schemes. The first, Scatter/Gather, is a communication
scheme whose goal is to bound the maximum drift among models on correct
servers. The second, Distributed Median Contraction (DMC), leverages the
geometric properties of the median in high dimensional spaces to bring
parameters within the correct servers back close to each other, ensuring
learning convergence. The third, Minimum-Diameter Averaging (MDA), is a
statistically-robust gradient aggregation rule whose goal is to tolerate
Byzantine workers. MDA requires loose bound on the variance of non-Byzantine
gradient estimates, compared to existing alternatives (e.g., Krum).
Interestingly, ByzSGD ensures Byzantine resilience without adding communication
rounds (on a normal path), compared to vanilla non-Byzantine alternatives.
ByzSGD requires, however, a larger number of messages which, we show, can be
reduced if we assume synchrony.

the same light, the micro-operator concept has emerged for local deployment of
5G for vertical specific service delivery. Even though microoperator networks
are expected to be deployed using 5G, most research on network slicing has been
directed towards the description on the traditional (MNO) networks with little

order to achieve slicing in a micro-operator network, it is of vital importance
to understand the different deployment scenarios that can exist and how slicing
can be realized for each of these deployments. In this paper, the microoperator
networks described include closed, open and mixed network, and for each of

further proposes approaches for the configuration of Network Slice Instances
