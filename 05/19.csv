  mechanism for particulate aggregation",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An extremely broad and important class of phenomena in nature involves the
settling and aggregation of matter under gravitation in fluid systems. Some
examples include: sedimenting marine snow particles in lakes and oceans
(central to carbon sequestration), dense microplastics in the oceans (which
impact ocean ecology and the food chain), and even iron snow on Mercury
(conjectured as its magnetic field source). These fluid systems all have stable
density stratification, which is known to trap particulates through upper
lightweight fluid coating the sinking particles, thus providing transient
buoyancy. The current understanding of aggregation of such trapped matter
involves collisions (due to Brownian motion, shear, and differential settling)
and adhesion. Here, we observe and rationalize a new fundamental effective
attractive mechanism by which particles suspended within stratification may
self-assemble and form large aggregates without need for short range binding
effects. This phenomenon arises through a complex interplay involving solute
diffusion, impermeable boundaries, and aggregate geometry, which produces
toroidal flows. We show that these toroidal flows yield attractive horizontal
forces between particles. We observe that many particles demonstrate a
collective motion revealing a system which self-assembles, appearing to solve
jigsaw-like puzzles on its way to organizing into a disc-like shape, with the
effective force increasing as the collective disc radius grows. Control
experiments with two objects isolate the individual dynamics, which are
quantitatively predicted through numerical integration of the underlying
equations of motion. This new mechanism may be an important process in
formation of marine snow aggregates and distribution of phytoplankton in lakes
and oceans. Further, it potentially provides a new mechanism for general
sorting and packing of layered material.

of high-dimensional data into low-dimensional spaces.
  While the new sets of coordinates specified by these mappings can closely
parameterize the data, they are generally complicated nonlinear functions of
the original variables. This makes them difficult to interpret physically.
  Furthermore, in data-driven model reduction applications the governing
equations may have structure that is destroyed by nonlinear mapping into
coordinates on an inertial manifold, creating a computational bottleneck for
simulations.
  Instead, we propose to identify a small collection of the original variables
which are capable of uniquely determining all others either locally via
immersion or globally via embedding of the underlying manifold.
  When the data lies on a low-dimensional subspace the existing discrete
empirical interpolation method (DEIM) accomplishes this with recent variants
employing greedy algorithms based on pivoted QR (PQR) factorizations.
  However, low-dimensional manifolds coming from a variety of applications,
particularly from advection-dominated PDEs, do not lie in or near any
low-dimensional subspace.
  Our proposed approach extends DEIM to data lying near nonlinear manifolds by
applying a similar pivoted QR procedure simultaneously on collections of
patches making up locally linear approximations of the manifold, resulting in a
novel simultaneously pivoted QR (SimPQR) algorithm.
  The immersion provided by SimPQR can be extended to an embedding by applying
SimPQR a second time to a modified collection of vectors.
  The SimPQR method for computing these `nonlinear DEIM' (NLDEIM) coordinates
is successfully applied to real-world data lying near an inertial manifold in a
cylinder wake flow as well as data coming from a viscous Burgers equation with
different initial conditions.

the design of structural and electronic components. Classical analytical
solutions to the heat equation PDE are not known for many such domains, even

approximations to a weak form continuum solution, with increasing accuracy as
the number of degrees of freedom in the model increases. This comes at a cost
of increased memory usage and computation time; even when taking advantage of
sparse matrix techniques for the finite element system matrix. We summarize
recent approaches in solving problems in structural mechanics and steady state
heat conduction which do not require the explicit assembly of any system
matrices, and adapt them to a method for solving the time-depended flow of
heat. These approaches are highly parallelizable, and can be performed on
graphical processing units (GPUs). Furthermore, they lend themselves to the
simulation of heterogeneous material, with a minimum of added complexity. We
present the mathematical framework of assembly-free FEM approaches, through
which we summarize the benefits of GPU computation. We discuss our
implementation using the OpenCL computing framework, and show how it is further
adapted for use on multiple GPUs. We compare the performance of single and dual
GPUs implementations of our method with previous GPU computing strategies from
the literature and a CPU sparse matrix approach. The utility of the novel
method is demonstrated through the solution of a real-world coefficient inverse

The formalism of GP regression is first reviewed, particularly in relation to
its application in learning local atomic energies and forces. For accurate
regression it is fundamental to incorporate prior knowledge into the GP kernel
function. To this end, this chapter details how properties of smoothness,
invariance and interaction order of a force field can be encoded into
corresponding kernel properties. A range of kernels is then proposed,
possessing all the required properties and an adjustable parameter $n$
governing the interaction order modelled. The order $n$ best suited to describe
a given system can be found automatically within the Bayesian framework by
maximisation of the marginal likelihood. The procedure is first tested on a toy
model of known interaction and later applied to two real materials described at
the DFT level of accuracy. The models automatically selected for the two
materials were found to be in agreement with physical intuition. More in
general, it was found that lower order (simpler) models should be chosen when
the data are not sufficient to resolve more complex interactions. Low $n$ GPs
can be further sped up by orders of magnitude by constructing the corresponding

them directly as a reward in reinforcement learning (RL) leads to suboptimal

complex rewards, which require tedious hand-tuning. We automate the reward
search with AutoRL, an evolutionary layer over standard RL that treats reward
tuning as hyperparameter optimization and trains a population of RL agents to
find a reward that maximizes the task objective. AutoRL, evaluated on four
Mujoco continuous control tasks over two RL algorithms, shows improvements over

learning models known for achieving strong predictive performance across a wide

interpretability (i.e. users are unable to understand the relationships a

particular, it is challenging to understand how the contribution of a
particular feature, or group of features, varies as their value changes. To
address this, we introduce Disentangled Attribution Curves (DAC), a method to
provide interpretations of tree ensemble methods in the form of (multivariate)
feature importance curves. For a given variable, or group of variables, DAC
plots the importance of a variable(s) as their value changes. We validate DAC
on real data by showing that the curves can be used to increase the accuracy of
logistic regression while maintaining interpretability, by including DAC as an
additional feature. In simulation studies, DAC is shown to out-perform
competing methods in the recovery of conditional expectations. Finally, through
a case-study on the bike-sharing dataset, we demonstrate the use of DAC to

radiative regions whenever the mean molecular weight increases with radius. In
some cases, it can have a significant observable impact on stellar structure
and evolution. The efficiency of mixing by fingering convection as a standalone
process has been studied by Brown et al. (2013), but other processes such as
rotation, magnetic fields and shear can affect it. In this paper, we present a
first study of the effect of shear on fingering (thermohaline) convection in
astrophysics. Using Direct Numerical Simulations we find that a moderate amount
of shear (that is not intrinsically shear-unstable) always decreases the mixing
efficiency of fingering convection, as a result of the tilt it imparts to the
fingering structures. We propose a simple analytical extension of the Brown et
al. (2013) model in the presence of shear that satisfactorily explains the
numerically-derived turbulent compositional mixing coefficient for moderate
shearing rates, and can trivially be implemented in stellar evolution codes. We
also measure from the numerical simulations a turbulent viscosity, and find
that the latter is strongly tied to the turbulent compositional mixing
coefficient. Observational implications and caveats of the model are discussed.

discrepancy is a pseudometric on graphs. Given two graphs, the optimal
transport associated with their Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancy provides the
correspondence between their nodes and achieves graph matching. When one of the
graphs has isolated but self-connected nodes ($i.e.$, a disconnected graph),
the optimal transport indicates the clustering structure of the other graph and
achieves graph partitioning. Using this concept, we extend our method to
multi-graph partitioning and matching by learning a Gromov-Wasserstein
barycenter graph for multiple observed graphs; the barycenter graph plays the
role of the disconnected graph, and since it is learned, so is the clustering.
Our method combines a recursive $K$-partition mechanism with a regularized
proximal gradient algorithm, whose time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(K(E+V)\log_K
V)$ for graphs with $V$ nodes and $E$ edges. To our knowledge, our method is
the first attempt to make Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancy applicable to
large-scale graph analysis and unify graph partitioning and matching into the

methods, achieving a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

non-parametric methods to estimate the regression coefficients and build tests
on the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Both
methods rely on the slopes of the connecting lines between pairwise
measurements. While Theil and Sen assume no measurement errors in the
independent variable, the method from Passing and Bablok accounts for errors in
both variables. Here we consider the case where multiple, e.g. repeated,
measurements with errors in both variables are available for m samples. We show
that in this case the slopes between repeated measurements need to be excluded
to obtain an unbiased estimate. We prove that the resulting
Block-Passing-Bablok estimate for grouped data is asymptotically normally
distributed. If measurements of the independent variable are without error the
variance of the estimate equals the variance of the Theil-Sen method with tied
ranks. If both variables are measured with imprecision the result depends on
the fraction of measurements between groups that fall within the range of each
other. Only if no overlap between measurements of different groups occurs the
variance equals again the tied ranks version. Otherwise, the variance is
smaller. We explicitly compute this variance and provide a method comparison
test for data with repeated measurements based on the method from Passing and
Bablok for independent measurements. If repeated measurements are considered
this test has a higher power to detect the true relationship between two
methods.

that combines both global and local information to produce better embeddings of
these points. We enhance our architecture with residual connections, to pass

are restricted to Euclidean settings, which precludes their application to
problem instances where one must reason about manifold-type constraints (that
is, constraints, such as loop closure, which restrict the motion of a system to
a subset of the ambient space). The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by
extending SCP-based trajectory optimization methods to a manifold setting. The
key insight is to leverage geometric embeddings to lift a manifold-constrained
trajectory optimization problem into an equivalent problem defined over a space
enjoying a Euclidean structure. This insight allows one to extend existing SCP
methods to a manifold setting in a fairly natural way. In particular, we
present a SCP algorithm for manifold problems with refined theoretical

control scheme. The proposed error metric is continuously sensitive to changes
in the swarm distribution, unlike commonly used discretization methods. We
analyze the theoretical and computational properties of the error metric and
propose two benchmarks to which error metric values can be compared. The first
uses the realizable extrema of the error metric to compute the relative error
of an observed swarm distribution. We also show that the error metric extrema
can be used to help choose the swarm size and effective radius of each robot
required to achieve a desired level of coverage. The second benchmark compares
the observed distribution of error metric values to the probability density
function of the error metric when robot positions are randomly sampled from the
target distribution. We demonstrate the utility of this benchmark in assessing
the performance of stochastic control algorithms. We prove that the error
metric obeys a central limit theorem, develop a streamlined method for
performing computations, and place the standard statistical tests used here on
a firm theoretical footing. We provide rigorous theoretical development,

network is considered to provide high-rate VR services, thus enabling a
successful visual perception. For this network, guaranteeing URLLC with high
rates requires overcoming the uncertainty stemming from the THz channel. To
this end, the achievable reliability and latency of VR services over THz links
are characterized. In particular, a novel expression for the probability
distribution function of the transmission delay is derived as a function of the
system parameters. Subsequently, the end-to-end (E2E) delay distribution that
takes into account both processing and transmission delay is found and a
tractable expression of the reliability of the system is derived as a function
of the THz network parameters such as the molecular absorption loss and noise,
the transmitted power, and the distance between the VR user and its respective
small base station (SBS). Numerical results show the effects of various system
parameters such as the bandwidth and the region of non-negligible interference
on the reliability of the system. In particular, the results show that THz can
deliver rates up to 16.4 Gbps and a reliability of 99.999% (with a delay
threshold of 30 ms) provided that the impact of the molecular absorption on the
THz links, which substantially limits the communication range of the SBS, is

hydrogen in its interior. The transition from molecular hydrogen to metallic
hydrogen as temperature and pressure increase is believed to be a smooth one.
As a result, the electrical conductivity in Jupiter varies continuously from
being negligible at the surface to a large value in the deeper region. Thus,
unlike the Earth where the upper boundary of the dynamo---the dynamo
radius---is definitively located at the core-mantle boundary, it is not clear
at what depth dynamo action becomes significant in Jupiter. In this paper,
using a numerical model of the Jovian dynamo, we examine the magnetic energy
spectrum at different depth and identify a dynamo radius below which (and away
from the deep inner core) the shape of the magnetic energy spectrum becomes
invariant. We find that this shift in the behaviour of the magnetic energy
spectrum signifies a change in the dynamics of the system as electric current
becomes important. Traditionally, a characteristic radius derived from the
Lowes--Mauersberger spectrum---the Lowes radius---gives a good estimate to the
Earth's core-mantle boundary. We argue that in our model, the Lowes radius
provides a lower bound to the dynamo radius. We also compare the
Lowes--Mauersberger spectrum in our model to that obtained from recent Juno
observations. The Lowes radius derived from the Juno data is significantly
lower than that obtained from our models. The existence of a stably stratified
region in the neighbourhood of the transition zone might provide an explanation
of this result.

  Discretization Problem and A Black-Box Adversarial Attack in Discrete Integer
  Domain",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Numerous methods for crafting adversarial examples were proposed recently
with high success rate. Since most existing machine learning based classifiers
normalize images into some continuous, real vector, domain firstly, attacks
often craft adversarial examples in such domain. However, ""adversarial""
examples may become benign after denormalizing them back into the discrete
integer domain, known as the discretization problem. This problem was mentioned
in some work, but has received relatively little attention.
  In this work, we first conduct a comprehensive study of existing methods and
tools for crafting. We theoretically analyze 34 representative methods and
empirically study 20 representative open source tools for crafting adversarial
images. Our study reveals that the discretization problem is far more serious
than originally thought. This suggests that the discretization problem should
be taken into account seriously when crafting adversarial examples and
measuring attack success rate. As a first step towards addressing this problem
in black-box scenario, we propose a black-box method which reduces the
adversarial example searching problem to a derivative-free optimization
problem. Our method is able to craft adversarial images by derivative-free
search in the discrete integer domain. Experimental results show that our
method is comparable to recent white-box methods (e.g., FGSM, BIM and C\&W) and
achieves significantly higher success rate in terms of adversarial examples in
the discrete integer domain than recent black-box methods (e.g., ZOO, NES-PGD
and Bandits). Moreover, our method is able to handle models that is
non-differentiable and successfully break the winner of NIPS 2017 competition
on defense with 95\% success rate. Our results suggest that discrete
optimization algorithms open up a promising area of research into effective
black-box attacks.

leverages control-plane traffic engineering techniques to concentrate
botnet-sourced Distributed Denial of Service flows on transit links. Executed
from a compromised or malicious Autonomous System (AS), Maestro advertises
specific-prefix routes poisoned for selected ASes to collapse inbound traffic
paths onto a single target link. A greedy heuristic fed by publicly available
AS relationship data iteratively builds the set of ASes to poison. Given a
compromised BGP speaker with advantageous positioning relative to the target
link in the Internet topology, an adversary can expect to enhance total flow
density by more than 30%. For a large botnet (e.g., Mirai), that translates to
augmenting a DDoS by more than a million additional infected hosts.
Interestingly, the size of the adversary-controlled AS plays little role in
this amplification effect. Devastating attacks on core links can be executed by
small, resource-limited ASes. To understand the scope of the attack, we
evaluate widespread Internet link vulnerability across several metrics,
including BGP betweenness and botnet flow density. We then assess where an
adversary must be positioned to execute the attack most successfully. Finally,
we present effective mitigations for network operators seeking to insulate

particle bunch of charged particles is derived. The radiation of twisted
photons by such particle bunches in stationary electromagnetic fields and in
propagating electromagnetic waves is investigated. It is shown that the
incoherent radiation by bunches of particles traversing normally an isotropic
dispersive medium (the edge, transition, and Vavilov-Cherenkov radiations) and
by bunches moving in a helical undulator does not depend on the azimuthal
distribution of particles in the bunch and is the same as for round bunches. As
for planar undulators, the incoherent radiation by particle bunches is the same
as for the bunches symmetric under reflection with respect to the axis of a
twisted photon detector. At high energies of recorded twisted photons, this
property is universal and holds for the forward incoherent radiation by any
cold relativistic particle bunch. The coherent radiation of twisted photons by
such particle bunches obeys the property that we call the addition rule. This
rule provides a simple means to describe the properties of coherent radiation
of twisted photons. Furthermore, the strong addition rule is established for
the coherent radiation by sufficiently long helical bunches. The use of this
rule allows one to elaborate superradiant pure sources of twisted photons. The
coherent radiation by helical bunches is considered for the edge, transition,
and Vavilov-Cherenkov processes and for particles moving in undulators and
plane laser waves with circular polarization. In these cases, the sum rules are
deduced for the total probability to record a twisted photon and for the
projection of the total angular momentum per photon. The explicit expressions
for both incoherent and coherent interference factors are derived for several
simple bunch profiles.

$B$ mesons via $Z$-penguin diagrams. Using constraints from relevant
observables in $K$ and $B$ sectors, we find that the 2$\sigma$ upper bound on
the branching ratio of ${\cal B}(t \to c Z)$ is $1.47 \times 10^{-5}$ for real
coupling and $1.91 \times 10^{-4}$ for complex coupling. The current
experimental upper bound from ATLAS and CMS collaborations on the branching
ratio of $t \to c Z$ are $2.4 \times 10^{-4}$ and $4.9\times 10^{-4}$ at $95\%$
C.L., respectively. Hence the possibility of observation of $t \to c Z$ decay
at the level of $10^{-4}$ would imply the anomalous couplings to be complex.
Such complex couplings should also show up its presence in other related
decays. We find that an order of magnitude enhancement is possible in the
branching ratio of $K_L \to \pi^0 \nu \bar{\nu}$. Further, the complex $tcZ$
coupling can also provide large enhancements in many $CP$ violating angular
observables in $B \to K^* \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay.

assumption of an input random field in which a countable number of independent

The field is constructed in such a way as to have the same mean and covariance

of the random field is used to compute expected values of a quantity of

is shown to yield a higher order cubature convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/p})$ independently of the dimension when used in conjunction

often lead to bottlenecks in traffic flows and cause congestion, delay, and
environmental problems. How to manage traffic smartly by intelligent signal
control is a significant challenge in urban traffic management. With recent
advances in machine learning, especially reinforcement learning (RL), traffic
signal control using advanced machine learning techniques represents a
promising solution to tackle this problem. In this paper, we propose a RL
approach for traffic signal control at urban intersections. Specifically, we
use neural networks as Q-function approximator (a.k.a. Q-network) to deal with
the complex traffic signal control problem where the state space is large and
the action space can be discrete. The state space is defined based on real-time
traffic information, i.e. vehicle position, direction and speed. The action
space includes various traffic signal phases which are critical in generating a
reasonable and realistic control mechanism, given the prominent
spatial-temporal characteristics of urban traffic. In the simulation
experiment, we use SUMO, an open source traffic simulator, to construct
realistic urban intersection settings. Moreover, we use different traffic
patterns, such as major/minor road traffic, through/left-turn lane traffic,
tidal traffic, and varying demand traffic, to train a generalized traffic
signal control model that can be adapted to various traffic conditions. The
simulation results demonstrate the convergence and generalization performance
of our RL approach as well as its significant benefits in terms of queue length
and wait time over several benchmarking methods in traffic signal control.

algorithm DSG for skip graphs. DSG performs topological adaption to
communication pattern to minimize the average routing costs between
communicating nodes. In this work, we present a distributed self-adjusting
algorithm (referred to as DyHypes) for topological adaption in hypercubic
networks. One of the major differences between hypercubes and skip graphs is
that hypercubes are more rigid in structure compared skip graphs. This property
makes self-adjustment significantly different in hypercubic networks than skip
graphs. Upon a communication between an arbitrary pair of nodes, DyHypes
transforms the network to place frequently communicating nodes closer to each
other to maximize communication efficiency, and uses randomization in the
transformation process to speed up the transformation and reduce message
complexity. We show that, as compared to DSG, DyHypes reduces the
transformation cost by a factor of $O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of
nodes involved in the transformation. Moreover, despite achieving faster
transformation with lower message complexity, the combined cost (routing and
transformation) of DyHypes is at most a $\log \log n$ factor more than that of
any algorithm that conforms to the computational model adopted for this work.
Similar to DSG, DyHypes is fully decentralized, conforms to the
$\mathcal{CONGEST}$ model, and requires $O(\log n)$ bits of memory for each
node, where $n$ is the total number of nodes.

surface water formation (SWF) such as dew and frost in the evergreen shrub at

interfacial and vertical temperature differences ranged from 1 to 3 K and were
necessary but not sufficient for super-saturated condensation on the natural

the growth of the condensed water embryos, originate from both the local and
the external sources such as evapotranspiration and atmospheric advection
driven by the reduced air pressure, cause SWF not only on the ground soil but
also on the vegetation canopy at 1-2 m height. The super-saturation ratio is
mainly determined by the coefficient of thermophoresis deposition, which
approaches to 1. SWF on the natural surface is not only an indicator but also a
weak cleaner of air pollution. The downward thermophoresis deposition of fine
particle and droplets favors SWF and the scavenging of air pollutants. The
removal efficiency of the deposition flux during SWF event for [SO42-+NO3-] is
estimated by ~0.3 mmol (per [Ca2+] meq)/m2(per leaf area).

an essential part of planning effective treatment strategies to combat lung and
esophageal cancer. Accurate segmentation of organs surrounding tumours helps
account for the variation in position and morphology inherent across patients,
thereby facilitating adaptive and computer-assisted radiotherapy. Although
manual delineation of OARs is still highly prevalent, it is prone to errors due
to complex variations in the shape and position of organs across patients, and
low soft tissue contrast between neighbouring organs in CT images. Recently,
deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained tremendous traction and
achieved state-of-the-art results in medical image segmentation. In this paper,
we propose a deep learning framework to segment OARs in thoracic CT images,
specifically for the: heart, esophagus, trachea and aorta. Our approach employs
dilated convolutions and aggregated residual connections in the bottleneck of a
U-Net styled network, which incorporates global context and dense information.
Our method achieved an overall Dice score of 91.57% on 20 unseen test samples

that strong prior information about scene geometry can be used to improve pose
estimation accuracy. To tackle this question empirically, we have assembled a
novel $\textbf{Geometric Pose Affordance}$ dataset, consisting of multi-view

utilized a commercial motion capture system to collect gold-standard estimates
of pose and construct accurate geometric 3D CAD models of the scene itself.
  To inject prior knowledge of scene constraints into existing frameworks for
pose estimation from images, we introduce a novel, view-based representation of
scene geometry, a $\textbf{multi-layer depth map}$, which employs multi-hit ray
tracing to concisely encode multiple surface entry and exit points along each
camera view ray direction. We propose two different mechanisms for integrating
multi-layer depth information pose estimation: input as encoded ray features
used in lifting 2D pose to full 3D, and secondly as a differentiable loss that
encourages learned models to favor geometrically consistent pose estimates. We
show experimentally that these techniques can improve the accuracy of 3D pose
estimates, particularly in the presence of occlusion and complex scene
geometry.

sentiments of comments with respect to given aspect terms or categories. In
previous ABSA methods, the importance of aspect has been realized and verified.
Most existing LSTM-based models take aspect into account via the attention
mechanism, where the attention weights are calculated after the context is
modeled in the form of contextual vectors. However, aspect-related information
may be already discarded and aspect-irrelevant information may be retained in
classic LSTM cells in the context modeling process, which can be improved to
generate more effective context representations. This paper proposes a novel
variant of LSTM, termed as aspect-aware LSTM (AA-LSTM), which incorporates
aspect information into LSTM cells in the context modeling stage before the
attention mechanism. Therefore, our AA-LSTM can dynamically produce
aspect-aware contextual representations. We experiment with several
representative LSTM-based models by replacing the classic LSTM cells with the
AA-LSTM cells. Experimental results on SemEval-2014 Datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of AA-LSTM.

methods if taking no care of label noise in SD, and to this end, we propose a
Butterfly framework, a powerful and efficient solution to WUDA. Butterfly
maintains four deep networks simultaneously, where two take care of all

this work is to describe late-time-accelerated expansion. Since finding
analytical solutions carrying all conserved currents emerged by Noether
symmetry approach, is very difficult, hence regularly in the literature, the
authors split the total symmetry into sub-symmetries and then select, usually,
some of them to be carried by the solutions. This manner limits the forms of
unknown functions obtained. However, in ref. [68], B.N.S. approach was proposed
in order to solve such problems but its main motivation was carrying more
conserved currents by solutions. In this paper, by eliminating the
aforementioned limitation as much as possible, a trick leading to some graceful
forms of unknown functions is suggested. Through this fruitful approach, the
solutions may carry more conserved currents than usual ways and maybe new forms
of symmetries. I named this new approach to be CSSS-trick (Combination of
Sub-symmetries through Special Selections). With this approach, it is
demonstrated that the unified dark matter potential is deduced by the gauge
fields. Utilizing the $\mathfrak{B}\text{-function}$ method, a detailed data
analysis of results obtained yielding perfect agreements with recent
observational data are performed. And finally, the Wheeler-De Witt (WDW)

quantum cosmology and we argue that the issue is intractable if the basic
postulates of quantum mechanics are not modified in a nontrivial way. Namely a
""standard"" quantum theory of gravity is expected to resolve the big-bang
singularity either by yielding a regular past eternal evolution or by a smooth
finite beginning; in both cases the initial state can in principle be totally
arbitrary. We illustrate this point in a minisuperspace, gauge fixed,
deparametrized toy model where there is a smooth beginning of the universe
provided by the matter Hamiltonian degenerating to the zero operator. This
arbitrariness is the source of several debates in the literature, especially in
relation to inflation, which can only be solved by a new paradigm involving
initial conditions that necessarily alters the usual quantum mechanical
treatment, but we argue that this is highly improbable.

their expressive power comes at a price: a number of fundamental decision
problems concerning (erasing) pattern languages, such as the membership problem
and inclusion problem, are known to be NP-complete or even undecidable, while
the decidability of the equivalence problem is still open; in learning theory,
the class of pattern languages is unlearnable in models such as the
distribution-free (PAC) framework (if $\mathcal{P}/poly \neq
\mathcal{NP}/poly$). Much work on the algorithmic learning of pattern languages
has thus focussed on interesting subclasses of patterns for which positive
learnability results may be achieved. A natural restriction on a pattern is a
bound on its variable frequency -- the maximum number $m$ such that some
variable occurs exactly $m$ times in the pattern. This paper examines the
effect of limiting the variable frequency of all patterns belonging to a class
$\Pi$ on the worst-case minimum number of labelled examples needed to uniquely
identify any pattern of $\Pi$ in cooperative teaching-learning models. Two such

eigenfrequencies by at least 25 times their linewidth by continuously varying
the elastic stress state in the membranes through a DC voltage. The light

verify using interactive theorem provers or automatic verification tools. Of
these techniques, deductive verification is highly expressive but requires the
user to annotate the system with inductive invariants. To relieve the user from
this labor-intensive and challenging task, invariant inference aims to find
inductive invariants automatically. Unfortunately, when applied to
infinite-state systems such as distributed protocols, existing inference
techniques often diverge, which limits their applicability.
  This paper proposes user-guided invariant inference based on phase
invariants, which capture the different logical phases of the protocol. Users
conveys their intuition by specifying a phase structure, an automaton with
edges labeled by program transitions; the tool automatically infers assertions
that hold in the automaton's states, resulting in a full safety proof.The
additional structure from phases guides the inference procedure towards finding
an invariant.
  Our results show that user guidance by phase structures facilitates
successful inference beyond the state of the art. We find that phase structures
are pleasantly well matched to the intuitive reasoning routinely used by domain
experts to understand why distributed protocols are correct, so that providing
a phase structure reuses this existing intuition.

incentivising users to internalize the negative externality of delay they cause

practice, the reporting of users's profit information incurs a large signalling
overhead. Besides, in reality users might falsely report their private profit
information. To overcome this, we further propose a learning-based pricing
mechanism where no knowledge of individual user profit functions is required.
At equilibrium, the optimal prices and average edge delays are learnt, and

novel tool for generating training data from the CARLA simulator to be used in
autonomous driving research. The tool is able to export high-quality,
synchronized LIDAR and camera data with object annotations, and offers
configuration to accurately reflect a real-life sensor array. Furthermore, we
use this tool to generate a dataset consisting of 10 000 samples and use this
dataset in order to train the 3D object detection network AVOD-FPN, with
finetuning on the KITTI dataset in order to evaluate the potential for
effective pretraining. We also present two novel LIDAR feature map

300,000 accounts that communicated with the #Charlottesville hashtag. The
retweet network is sharply polarized, with an assortativity coefficient of 0.8

communities in terms of Left/Right node composition. When comparing tweet
content, we find that tweets about `Trump' were widespread in both the Left and
Right, though the accompanying language was unsurprisingly different. Nodes
with large degrees in communities on the Left include accounts that are
associated with disparate areas, including activism, business, arts and
entertainment, media, and politics. Support of Donald Trump was a common thread
among the Right communities, connecting communities with accounts that

success since its inception in 2004 due to its constraint-based formalism that
is rigorously derived from a many-body starting point. However, while vdW-DF
can describe binding energies and structures for van der Waals complexes and
mixed systems with good accuracy, one long-standing criticism---also since its
inception---has been that the $C_6$ coefficients that derive from the vdW-DF
framework are largely inaccurate and can be wrong by more than a factor of two.
It has long been thought that this failure to describe the $C_6$ coefficients
is a conceptual flaw of the underlying plasmon framework used to derive vdW-DF.
We prove here that this is not the case and that accurate $C_6$ coefficient can
be obtained without sacrificing the accuracy at binding separations from a
modified framework that is fully consistent with the constraints and design
philosophy of the original vdW-DF formulation. Our design exploits a degree of
freedom in the plasmon-dispersion model $\omega_{\mathbf{q}}$, modifying the
strength of the long-range van der Waals interaction and the cross-over from
long to short separations, with additional parameters tuned_ to reference
systems. Testing the new formulation for a range of different systems, we not
only confirm the greatly improved description of $C_6$ coefficients, but we
also find excellent performance for molecular dimers and other systems. The
importance of this development is not necessarily that particular aspects such
as $C_6$ coefficients or binding energies are improved, but rather that our
finding opens the door for further conceptual developments of an entirely
unexplored direction within the exact same constrained-based non-local
framework that made vdW-DF so successful in the first place.

capture the full crossover from the groundstate entanglement regime at low
energies and small subsystem size (area or log-area law) to the extensive
volume-law regime at high energies or large subsystem size. For critical
one-dimensional systems, a universal scaling function follows from conformal
field theory (CFT) and can be adapted for nonlinear dispersions. We use it to
also deduce the crossover scaling function for Fermi liquids in $d>1$

perform classification tasks with very less number of training samples. For the
MNIST dataset, with as low as $0.1 \%$ of the total training data, our method
