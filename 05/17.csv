  Optimization","12 pages, 1 figure, submitted to 34th IEEE/ACM International
  Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2019)",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When security bugs are detected, they should be (a)~discussed privately by
security software engineers; and (b)~not mentioned to the general public until
security patches are available. Software engineers usually report bugs to bug
tracking system, and label them as security bug reports (SBRs) or not-security
bug reports (NSBRs), while SBRs have a higher priority to be fixed before
exploited by attackers than NSBRs. Yet suspected security bug reports are often
publicly disclosed because the mislabelling issues ( i.e., mislabel security
bug reports as not-security bug report). The goal of this paper is to aid
software developers to better classify bug reports that identify security
vulnerabilities as security bug reports through parameter tuning of learners
and data pre-processor. Previous work has applied text analytics and machine
learning learners to classify which reported bugs are security related. We
improve on that work, as shown by our analysis of five open source projects. We
apply hyperparameter optimization to (a)~the control parameters of a learner;
and (b)~the data pre-processing methods that handle the case where the target
class is a small fraction of all the data. We show that optimizing the
pre-processor is more useful than optimizing the learners. We also show that
improvements gained from our approach can be very large. For example, using the
same data sets as recently analyzed by our baseline approach, we show that
adjusting the data pre-processing results in improvements to classification
recall of 35% to 65% (median to max) with moderate increment of false positive
rate.

two parallel plate capacitors, one of them is in parallel with the inductor and
the other is coupled to a microwave transmission line which carries the signals

creates a normal hot spot which produces a voltage pulse across the LC circuit.
This pulse rings down at the resonant frequency of the LC circuit over a time
period that is fixed by the quality factor. We present measurements of an array
of these devices and an evaluation of their performance in terms of frequency

of elementary links in a quantum network, which is a crucial initial
requirement that must be met before any long-range entanglement distribution

We obtain bounds on these figures of merit for a particular class of quantum
repeater protocols consisting of repeat-until-success elementary link
generation followed by joining measurements at intermediate nodes that extend
the entanglement range. Our results lead to requirements on quantum memory
coherence times, requirements on repeater chain lengths in order to surpass the

implementations. These requirements are based solely on the inherently
probabilistic nature of elementary link generation in quantum networks, and
they apply to networks with arbitrary topology.

vectors into compact codes thanks to a combination of quantizers. Large
databases can, therefore, be stored entirely in RAM, enabling fast responses to
NN queries. In almost all cases, PQ uses 8-bit quantizers as they offer low

Compared to 8-bit quantizers, 16-bit quantizers boost accuracy but they
increase response time by a factor of 3 to 10. We propose a novel approach that
allows 16-bit quantizers to offer the same response time as 8-bit quantizers,
while still providing a boost of accuracy. Our approach builds on two key
ideas: (i) the construction of derived codebooks that allow a fast and

builds a candidate set using the derived codebooks, and then refines it using
16-bit quantizers. On 1 billion SIFT vectors, with an inverted index, our

organs, facilitating disease diagnosis, but it incurs more radiation dose to a
patient and a CT scanner is much more cost prohibitive than an X-ray machine
too. Traditional CT reconstruction methods require hundreds of X-ray
projections through a full rotational scan of the body, which cannot be
performed on a typical X-ray machine. In this work, we propose to reconstruct
CT from two orthogonal X-rays using the generative adversarial network (GAN)
framework. A specially designed generator network is exploited to increase data
dimension from 2D (X-rays) to 3D (CT), which is not addressed in previous
research of GAN. A novel feature fusion method is proposed to combine
information from two X-rays.The mean squared error (MSE) loss and adversarial
loss are combined to train the generator, resulting in a high-quality CT volume
both visually and quantitatively. Extensive experiments on a publicly available
chest CT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It could
be a nice enhancement of a low-cost X-ray machine to provide physicians a
CT-like 3D volume in several niche applications.

to the task, reveal that training with Gated Convolutional Neural Networks give
significantly better performance on target domains than regular convolution and

filter domain specific knowledge as well, their complexity order is remarkably
high as compared to gated architectures. GCNs rely on convolution hence gaining

elusive since the scale of the constituents is tiny and in most cases few of

is a model system where some of the experimental challenges inherent to this
general question can be tackled by adequately choosing the host superconducting
sample. For instance, Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8 + \delta}$ is a type-II
superconductor with weak point disorder that presents a transition between two
glassy phases on increasing the constituents' (vortices) density. At low vortex
densities, the impact of disorder produces the nucleation of a glassy yet
quasi-crystalline phase, the Bragg glass. For high vortex densities the stable
phase, coined as $\textit{vortex glass}$, was proposed to be disordered, but
its structural properties have remained elusive up to now. Here we answer this
question by combining surface and bulk vortex imaging techniques, and show that
the vortex glass is neither a messy nor a hexatic phase: in the plane of
vortices it presents large crystallites with positional correlations growing
algebraically and short-ranged orientational order. However, no dramatic change
in the correlation length along the direction of vortices is observed on

recent developments in a single framework. We find that the existing
variational lower bounds degrade when the MI is large, exhibiting either high
bias or high variance. To address this problem, we introduce a continuum of
lower bounds that encompasses previous bounds and flexibly trades off bias and
variance. On high-dimensional, controlled problems, we empirically characterize
the bias and variance of the bounds and their gradients and demonstrate the
effectiveness of our new bounds for estimation and representation learning.

two $p$-wave superconducting wires separated by a non-topological junction,
focusing on the primary errors (i.e., qubit-loss) and secondary errors (bit and
phase-flip) that arise due to non-adiabaticity. On the question of qubit-loss
we examine the system's response to both periodic boundary driving and
deliberate shuttling of the Majorana bound states. In the former scenario we
show how the frequency dependent rate of qubit-loss is strongly correlated with
the local density of states at the edge of wire, a fact that can make systems
with a larger gap more susceptible to high frequency noise. In the second
scenario we confirm previous predictions concerning super-adiabaticity and
critical velocity, but see no evidence that the coordinated movement of edge
boundaries reduces qubit-loss. Our analysis on secondary bit flip errors shows
that it is necessary that non-adiabaticity occurs in both wires and that
inter-wire tunnelling be present for this error channel to be open. We also
demonstrate how such processes can be minimised by disordering central regions
of both wires. Finally we identify an error channel for phase flip errors,
which can occur due to mismatches in the energies of states with bulk
excitations. In the non-interacting system considered here this error
systematically opposes the expected phase rotation due to finite size splitting
in the qubit subspace.

implemented properly in the current EPRL-FK spinfoam vertex amplitude, if
extended to arbitrary polyhedra. We then propose that a certain knot-invariant
of the bivector geometry, induced on the boundary graph, encodes the missing
conditions, allowing for reconstruction of a polytope from its two-dimensional
faces. Implemented in the quantum amplitude, this leads to corrected
semi-classical asymptotics for a hypercuboid, and is conjectured to be
non-trivial in more general situations. The analysis of linear version of
`volume simplicity' suggests to switch from hypersurface normals to edge
lengths, that is from 3-forms directly to tetrads -- in the extended
configuration space of the Plebanski constrained formulation. We then give the
corresponding dual version of linear simplicity constraints, which prescribe 3d
volume for the polyhedral faces in the boundary of a 4d polytope. We also
analyse the status of metric/vielbein degrees of freedom and the role of local

evolves in a random environment given by a $\gamma$-Liouville measure. The

study the same limiting dynamics, but where the speed of microscopic updates is
highly inhomogeneous in space and is driven by the $\gamma$-Liouville measure
associated with a two-dimensional log-correlated field $h$. Roughly speaking,
this continuum percolation process evolves very rapidly where the field $h$ is
high and barely moves where the field $h$ is low. Our main results can be
summarized as follows.
  1. First, we build this inhomogeneous dynamical percolation which we call
$\gamma$-Liouville dynamical percolation (LDP) by taking the scaling limit of
the associated process on the triangular lattice. We work with three different
regimes each requiring different tools: $\gamma\in [0,2-\sqrt{5/2})$,
$\gamma\in [2-\sqrt{5/2}, \sqrt{3/2})$, and $\gamma\in(\sqrt{3/2},2)$.
  2. When $\gamma<\sqrt{3/2}$, we prove that $\gamma$-LDP is mixing in the
Schramm-Smirnov space as $t\to \infty$, quenched in the log-correlated field
$h$. On the contrary, when $\gamma>\sqrt{3/2}$ the process is frozen in time.
The ergodicity result is a crucial piece of the Cardy embedding project of the
second and fourth coauthors, where LDP for $\gamma=\sqrt{1/6}$ is used to study
the scaling limit of a variant of dynamical percolation on uniform
triangulations.
  3. When $\gamma<\sqrt{3/4}$, we obtain quantitative bounds on the mixing of
quad crossing events.

step response of bus frequencies can be decomposed in two components. The first
component is a {system-wide frequency} that captures the aggregate grid
behavior, and the residual component represents the individual bus frequency
deviations from the aggregate. Using this decomposition, we define --and
compute in closed form-- several metrics that capture dynamic behaviors that
are of relevance for power engineers. In particular, using the \emph{system
frequency}, we define industry-style metrics (Nadir, RoCoF) that are evaluated
through a representative machine. We further use the norm of the residual
component to define a \emph{synchronization cost} that can appropriately
quantify inter-area oscillations. Finally, we employ robustness analysis tools
to evaluate deviations from our proportionality assumption. We show that the
system frequency still captures the grid steady-state deviation, and becomes an
accurate reduced-order model of the grid as the network connectivity grows.
Simulation studies with practically relevant data are included to validate the
theory and further illustrate the impact of network structure and parameters on
synchronization. Our analysis gives conclusions of practical interest,
sometimes challenging the conventional wisdom in the field.

dominate at higher densities. We discuss prospects of current and future

outside halos. Detecting filament gas directly would require a very long

23% of the sample) and purely star-forming SBs (SBs-SFR). We visually inspected
their HST/UV-restframe maps: SBs-SFR are generally irregular and composite
systems; ? 50% of SBs-AGN are instead dominated by regular compact
morphologies. We then found archival ALMA continuum counterparts for 33
galaxies (12 SBs-AGN and 21 SBs-SFR). For these sources we computed dust
masses, and, with standard assumptions, we also guessed total molecular
gas-masses. SBs turn to be gas rich systems (fgas = Mgas=Mgas/(Mgas+M*) \sim
20%-70%), and the gas fractions of the two SB classes are very similar (fgas =
43 +/-4% and fgas = 42+/- 2%). Our results show that SBs are consistent with a
mixture of: 1) highly star-forming merging systems (dominating the SBs-SFR),
and 2) primordial galaxies, rapidly growing their M* together with their Black

AGN luminosities in the range 10^44 < Lbol(AGN) < 10^46 erg/s (compared to

quotient schemes, smaller association schemes which are often easier to

interested in three goals: building new examples of cometric schemes, drawing
connections between cometric schemes and other objects, and finding new
realizability conditions on feasible parameter sets --- using these conditions
to rule out open parameter sets when possible. After introducing association
schemes, this thesis focuses on a few recent results regarding cometric schemes

positive semidefinite matrices with few distinct entries and later establishing
new conditions on realizable parameter sets. We then focus on imprimitive

angular momentum transport in stars and planets. We adopt a local Boussinesq
Cartesian shearing box model, which represents a small patch of a
differentially rotating stellar radiation zone. Complementary simulations are
also performed with stress-free, impenetrable boundaries in the local radial
direction. The linear and nonlinear evolution of the equatorial axisymmetric
instability is formally equivalent to the salt fingering instability. This is
no longer the case in 3D, but we find that the instability behaves nonlinearly
in a similar way to salt fingering. Axisymmetric simulations -- and those in 3D
with short dimensions along the local azimuthal direction -- quickly develop
strong jets along the rotation axis, which inhibit the instability and lead to
predator-prey-like temporal dynamics. In 3D, the instability initially produces
homogeneous turbulence and enhanced momentum transport, though in some cases
jets form on a much longer timescale. We propose and validate numerically a
simple theory for nonlinear saturation of the GSF instability and its resulting
angular momentum transport. This theory is straightforward to implement in
stellar evolution codes incorporating rotation. We estimate that the GSF

magnitude in the ratio between the AGN bolometric luminosity, derived from the
spectral energy distribution (SED) decomposition, and the same quantity
obtained by the published XMM-Newton 2-10 keV luminosity.
  The selected sources are UGC05101, NGC1194 and NGC3079 for which the

extending to energies up to ~30-45 keV, allows us an accurate determination of
the column density, and hence of the true intrinsic power.

2.1 and 2.4 x10^{24} cm-2 for UGC05101, NGC1194 and NGC3079, respectively) and
are consistent with the prominent silicate absorption feature observed in the

because in the $m_Q \to \infty$ limit, the light degrees of freedom in both the
hadrons are expected to be in identical configurations. Hyperfine splittings of
the ground states in both systems are nonvanishing at $O(1/m_Q)$ in the heavy
quark mass expansion and HQDQ symmetry relates the hyperfine splittings in the
two sectors. In this paper, working within the framework of Non-Relativistic
QCD (NRQCD), we point out the existence of an operator that couples four heavy
quark fields to the chromomagnetic field with a coefficient that is enhanced by
a factor from Coulomb exchange. This operator gives a correction to doubly
heavy baryon hyperfine splittings that scales as $1/m_Q^2 \times \alpha_S/r$,
where $r$ is the separation between the heavy quarks in the diquark. This
correction can be calculated analytically in the extreme heavy quark limit in
which the potential between the quarks in the diquark is Coulombic. In this
limit, the correction is $O(\alpha_s^2/m_Q)$ and comes with a small
coefficient. For values of $\alpha_s$ relevant to doubly charm and doubly
bottom systems, the correction to the hyperfine splittings in doubly heavy
baryons is only a few percent or smaller. We also argue that nonperturbative
corrections to the prediction for the hyperfine splittings are suppressed by
$\Lambda^2_{\rm QCD}/m_Q^2$ rather than $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/m_Q$. Corrections
should be $\approx 10\%$ in the charm sector and smaller in heavier systems.

topological and imply the presence of localized edge modes. We primarily focus
on the $1+1d$ case where the edge has a topological degeneracy, whose
finite-size splitting can be exponential or algebraic in system size depending
on the involvement of additional gapped sectors. An example of the former is
given by tuning the spin-1 Heisenberg chain to a symmetry-breaking Ising phase.
An example of the latter arises between the gapped Ising and cluster phases:
this symmetry-enriched Ising CFT has an edge mode with finite-size splitting

physiological and pathological processes such as tissue regeneration, immune
response and cancer progression. During migration, individual cells can
generate active pulling forces via actin filament contraction, which are
transmitted to the ECM fibers through focal adhesion complexes, remodel the
ECM, and eventually propagate to and can be sensed by other cells in the
system. The microstructure and physical properties of the ECM can also
significantly influence cell migration, e.g., via durotaxis and contact
guidance. Here, we develop a computational model for cell migration regulated
by cell-ECM micro-mechanical coupling. Our model explicitly takes into account
a variety of cellular level processes including focal adhesion formation and
disassembly, active traction force generation and cell locomotion due to actin
filament contraction, transmission and propagation of tensile forces in the
ECM, as well as the resulting ECM remodeling. We validate our model by
accurately reproducing single-cell dynamics of MCF-10A breast cancer cells
migrating on collagen gels and show that the durotaxis and contact guidance
effects naturally arise as a consequence of the cell-ECM micro-mechanical
interactions considered in the model. Moreover, our model predicts strongly
correlated multi-cellular migration dynamics, which are resulted from the
ECM-mediated mechanical coupling among the migrating cell and are subsequently
verified in {\it in vitro} experiments using MCF-10A cells. Our computational
model provides a robust tool to investigate emergent collective dynamics of

scenarios: a population of unresolved binaries and triples with an exotic mass

Gaia DR2 in combination with the photometric OmegaCAM catalog to test and
confirm the presence of the putative three stellar populations. We also study
multiple stellar systems in the ONC for the first time using Gaia DR2. We
confirm that the second and third sequence members are more centrally

that the parallax and proper motion distributions are different among the
members of the stellar sequences. The age difference among stellar populations
is estimated to be 1-2 Myr. We use Gaia measurements to identify and remove as
many unresolved multiple system candidates as possible. Nevertheless we are
still able to recover two well-separated sequences with evidence for the third
one, supporting the existence of the three stellar populations. We were able to
identify a substantial number of wide binary objects (separation between
1000-3000 au). This challenges previously inferred values that suggested no
wide binary stars exist in the ONC. Our inferred wide-binary fraction is approx
5%. We confirm the three populations correspond to three separated episodes of

industry to process seismic data. It is a computationally intensive task that
suits well in parallel computers. Methods such as RTM can be parallelized in
shared memory systems through scheduling iterations of parallel loops to
threads. However, several aspects, such as memory size and hierarchy, number of
cores, and input size, make optimal scheduling very challenging. In this paper,
we introduce a run-time strategy to automatically tune the dynamic scheduling
of parallel loops iterations in iterative applications, such as the RTM, in
multicore systems. The proposed method aims to reduce the execution time of
such applications. To find the optimal granularity, we propose a coupled
simulated annealing (CSA) based auto-tuning strategy that adjusts the chunk
size of work that OpenMP parallel loops assign dynamically to worker threads
during the initialization of a 3D RTM application. Experiments performed with
different computational systems and input sizes show that the proposed method
is consistently better than the default OpenMP schedulers, static, auto, and
guided, causing the application to be up to 33% faster. We show that the
possible reason for this performance is the reduction of cache misses, mainly
level L3, and low overhead, inferior to 2%. Having shown to be robust and
scalable for the 3D RTM, the proposed method could also improve the performance
of similar wave-based algorithms, such as full-waveform inversion (FWI) and
other iterative applications.

We develop highly efficient computational tools to directly extract the Pn

microstructures, we show that these novel statistical descriptors effectively
""decompose"" the structural features of interest into a set of ""polytope basis"",

variable-sized data, and learn deep features. Their limitation is that they do
not scale well with the size of the data. Existing approaches address this
using a deep random feature (DRF) expansion model, which makes inference
tractable by approximating DGPs. However, DRF is not suitable for
variable-sized input data such as trees, graphs, and sequences. We introduce
the GP-DRF, a novel Bayesian model with an input layer of GPs, followed by DRF
layers. The key advantage is that the combination of GP and DRF leads to a
tractable model that can both handle a variable-sized input as well as learn
deep long-range dependency structures of the data. We provide a novel efficient
method to simultaneously infer the posterior of GP's latent vectors and infer
the posterior of DRF's internal weights and random frequencies. Our experiments
show that GP-DRF outperforms the standard GP model and DRF model across many
datasets. Furthermore, they demonstrate that GP-DRF enables improved
uncertainty quantification compared to GP and DRF alone, with respect to a
Bhattacharyya distance assessment. Source code is available at

detection typically employs per-file numerical feature vector representations
as input with one or more target labels during training. However, there is much
orthogonal information that can be gleaned from the \textit{context} in which
the file was seen. In this paper, we propose utilizing a static source of
contextual information -- the path of the PE file -- as an auxiliary input to
the classifier. While file paths are not malicious or benign in and of
themselves, they do provide valuable context for a malicious/benign
determination. Unlike dynamic contextual information, file paths are available
with little overhead and can seamlessly be integrated into a multi-view static
ML detector, yielding higher detection rates at very high throughput with
minimal infrastructural changes. Here we propose a multi-view neural network,
which takes feature vectors from PE file content as well as corresponding file
paths as inputs and outputs a detection score. To ensure realistic evaluation,
we use a dataset of approximately 10 million samples -- files and file paths
from user endpoints of an actual security vendor network. We then conduct an
interpretability analysis via LIME modeling to ensure that our classifier has
learned a sensible representation and see which parts of the file path most
contributed to change in the classifier's score. We find that our model learns
useful aspects of the file path for classification, while also learning
artifacts from customers testing the vendor's product, e.g., by downloading a
directory of malware samples each named as their hash. We prune these artifacts
from our test dataset and demonstrate reductions in false negative rate of
32.3% at a $10^{-3}$ false positive rate (FPR) and 33.1% at $10^{-4}$ FPR, over

potential of ultra-high dose rate irradiation (also known as FLASH) for

the radioprotecting effect of FLASH irradiation could be due to the specific
sparing of hypoxic stem cell niches, which have been identified in several
organs including the bone marrow and the brain. To explore this hypothesis, a
new computational model is presented that frames transient radiolytic oxygen
depletion (ROD) during FLASH irradiation in terms of its effect on the oxygen
enhancement ratio (OER). The model takes into consideration oxygen diffusion
through the tissue, its consumption by metabolic cells, and its radiolytic
depletion to estimate the relative decrease in radiosensitivity of cells
receiving FLASH irradiation. Based on this model, several predictions are made
that could be tested in future experiments: (1) the FLASH effect should
gradually disappear as the radiation pulse duration is increased from <1s to 10
s; (2) dose should be deposited using the smallest number of radiation pulses
to achieve the greatest FLASH effect; (3) a FLASH effect should only be
observed in cells that are already hypoxic at the time of irradiation; and (4)
changes in capillary oxygen tension (increase or decrease) should diminish the
FLASH effect.

Classical and quantum photonic systems with EPs have attracted tremendous
attention due to their unusual properties, topological features, and an
enhanced sensitivity that depends on the order of the EP, i.e. the number of
degenerate eigenmodes. Yet, experimentally engineering higher-order EPs in
classical or quantum domains remains an open challenge due to the stringent
symmetry constraints that are required for the coalescence of multiple

and post-selected to the $N$-photon subspace, will exhibit an EP of order
$N+1$. By using the well-established mapping between a beamsplitter Hamiltonian

analytically obtain the time evolution of a general $N$-photon state, and
numerically simulate the system's evolution in the post-selected manifold. Our
results pave the way towards realizing robust, arbitrary-order EPs on demand in

propagation through an inhomogeneous material, the most crucial parameter is
the effective wavenumber. For this reason, there are many published studies on
how to calculate a single effective wavenumber. Here we present a proof that
there does not exist a unique effective wavenumber; instead, there are an
infinite number of such (complex) wavenumbers. We show that in most parameter
regimes only a small number of these effective wavenumbers make a significant

randomly distributed circular cylindrical inclusions. We calculate the
effective medium by ensemble averaging over all possible inhomogeneities. The
proof is based on the application of the Wiener-Hopf technique and makes no

  Elements",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A widely used approximation of the Gaussian curvature on a triangulated
surface is the angle defect, which measures the deviation between $2\pi$ and
the sum of the angles between neighboring edges emanating from a common vertex.
We show that the linearization of the angle defect about an arbitrary piecewise
constant Regge metric is related to the classical Hellan-Herrmann-Johnson
finite element discretization of the div-div operator. Integrating this
relation leads to an integral formula for the angle defect which is well-suited
for analysis and generalizes naturally to higher order. We prove error
estimates for these high-order approximations of the Gaussian curvature in
$H^k$-Sobolev norms of integer order $k \ge -1$.

single images. Recent work often focuses on the accuracy of the depth map,
where an evaluation on a publicly available test set such as the KITTI vision
benchmark is often the main result of the article. While such an evaluation
shows how well neural networks can estimate depth, it does not show how they do
this. To the best of our knowledge, no work currently exists that analyzes what
these networks have learned.
  In this work we take the MonoDepth network by Godard et al. and investigate
what visual cues it exploits for depth estimation. We find that the network
ignores the apparent size of known obstacles in favor of their vertical
position in the image. Using the vertical position requires the camera pose to
be known; however we find that MonoDepth only partially corrects for changes in
camera pitch and roll and that these influence the estimated depth towards
obstacles. We further show that MonoDepth's use of the vertical image position
allows it to estimate the distance towards arbitrary obstacles, even those not
appearing in the training set, but that it requires a strong edge at the ground
contact point of the object to do so. In future work we will investigate
whether these observations also apply to other neural networks for monocular
depth estimation.

truncating the loop or using less accurate approximations can induce biases

optimization convergence rates independent of the length of the loop or the
required accuracy of the approximation. We also derive a method for tuning RT

we find that both sets of different exponents can be found even within a single
model of interdependent networks, depending on the dependency coupling
strength. Specifically, the exponent $\gamma$ in the first-order regime (high
coupling) does not obey the fluctuation dissipation theorem, whereas in the
continuous regime (for low coupling) it does. Nevertheless, in both cases they
satisfy Widom's identity, $\delta - 1 = \gamma / \beta$ which further supports

Daily Living (ADLs). In this work, we study how to enable service robots to use
human multi-modal data to understand object manipulation actions, and how they
can recognize such actions when humans perform them during human-robot
collaboration tasks. The multi-modal data in this study consists of videos,
hand motion data, applied forces as represented by the pressure patterns on the
hand, and measurements of the bending of the fingers, collected as human
subjects performed manipulation actions. We investigate two different
approaches. In the first one, we show that multi-modal signal (motion, finger
bending and hand pressure) generated by the action can be decomposed into a set
of primitives that can be seen as its building blocks. These primitives are
used to define 24 multi-modal primitive features. The primitive features can in
turn be used as an abstract representation of the multi-modal signal and
employed for action recognition. In the latter approach, the visual features
are extracted from the data using a pre-trained image classification deep
convolutional neural network. The visual features are subsequently used to
train the classifier. We also investigate whether adding data from other
modalities produces a statistically significant improvement in the classifier
performance. We show that both approaches produce a comparable performance.
This implies that image-based methods can successfully recognize human actions
during human-robot collaboration. On the other hand, in order to provide
training data for the robot so it can learn how to perform object manipulation
actions, multi-modal data provides a better alternative.

process of software development. A modern web-based UI is an amalgam of reports
from dozens of microservices written by multiple teams. Queries on a page that
opens up another will fail if any of that page's microservices fails. As a
result, the overall cost for automated UI testing is high since the UI elements
cannot be tested in isolation. For example, the entire automated UI testing
suite at LexisNexis takes around 30 hours (3-5 hours on the cloud) to execute,
which slows down the continuous integration process.
  To mitigate this problem and give developers faster feedback on their code,
test case prioritization techniques are used to reorder the automated UI test
cases so that more failures can be detected earlier. Given that much of the
automated UI testing is ""black box"" in nature, very little information (only
the test case descriptions and testing results) can be utilized to prioritize
these automated UI test cases. Hence, this paper evaluates 17 ""black box"" test
case prioritization approaches that do not rely on source code information.

the test cases when new failures are detected, by applying and adapting a state
of the art framework from the total recall problem. Experimental results on
LexisNexis automated UI testing data show that our new approach (which we call
TERMINATOR), outperformed prior state of the art approaches in terms of failure
detection rates with negligible CPU overhead.

dense. This result gives us a positive answer to the Zariski dense orbit
conjecture proposed by Medvedev and Scanlon, by Amerik, Bogomolov and Rovinsky,
and by Zhang, for endomorphisms of smooth projective surfaces.
  Moreover, we define a new canonical topology on varieties over an
algebraically closed field which has finite transcendence degree over
$\mathbb{Q}$. We call it the adelic topology. The adelic topology is stronger
than the Zariski topology and an irreducible variety is still irreducible in
this topology. Using the adelic topology, we propose an adelic verison of the
Zariski dense orbit conjecture. This version is stronger then the original one
and it quantifies how many such orbits there are. We also proved this adelic
version for endomorphisms of smooth projective surfaces. Moreover, we proved
the adelic verison of the Zariski dense orbit conjecture for endomorphisms of

directly interact with microgel charges or are modelled implicitly through a
Debye-H\""uckel description. We do so by performing extensive numerical
simulations of single microgels across the volume phase transition (VPT)
varying the temperature and the fraction of charged monomers. We find that the
presence of charges considerably alters the microgel structure, quantified by
the monomer density profiles and by the form factors of the microgels,
particularly close to the VPT. We observe significant deviations between the
implicit and explicit models, with the latter comparing more favourably to
available experiments. In particular, we observe a shift of the VPT temperature
to larger values as the amount of charged monomers increases. We also find that
below the VPT the microgel-counterion complex is almost neutral, while it
develops a net charge above the VPT. Interestingly, under these conditions the
collapsed microgel still retains a large amount of counterions inside its

have been proposed in the literature, but the fundamental task of reasoning
about probabilistic events is a challenging one, owing to the intractability of
inference.
  The focus of this paper is taking steps towards the application of tractable
models to fairness. Tractable probabilistic models have emerged that guarantee
that conditional marginal can be computed in time linear in the size of the
model. In particular, we show that sum product networks (SPNs) enable an
effective technique for determining the statistical relationships between
protected attributes and other training variables. If a subset of these
training variables are found by the SPN to be independent of the training
attribute then they can be considered `safe' variables, from which we can train
a classification model without concern that the resulting classifier will
result in disparate outcomes for different demographic groups.
  Our initial experiments on the `German Credit' data set indicate that this
processing technique significantly reduces disparate treatment of male and
female credit applicants, with a small reduction in classification accuracy
compared to state of the art. We will also motivate the concept of ""fairness
through percentile equivalence"", a new definition predicated on the notion that
individuals at the same percentile of their respective distributions should be
treated equivalently, and this prevents unfair penalisation of those
individuals who lie at the extremities of their respective distributions.

models are under development to understand their properties. We propose a
population of ""Oort"" planets around other stars, forming by a mechanism
analogous to how the Solar System's Oort cloud of comets was populated.
Gravitational scattering among planets is inferred from the eccentricity
distribution of gas-giant exoplanets measured by the Doppler technique. This
scattering is thought to commence while the protoplanetary disk is dissipating,
$10^6-10^7$ yr after formation of the star, or perhaps soon thereafter, when
the majority of stars are expected to be part of a natal cluster. Previous
calculations of planet-planet scattering around isolated stars have one or more
planets spending $10^4-10^7$ yr at distances >100 AU before ultimately being
ejected. During that time, a close flyby of another star in the cluster may
dynamically lift the periastron of the planet, ending further scattering with
the inner planets. We present numerical simulations demonstrating this
mechanism as well as an analysis of the efficiency. We estimate an occurrence
of planets between 100 and 5000 AU by this mechanism to be <1% for gas giants

from a former AGB companion, yielding a white dwarf and a dC star that has
gained both significant mass and angular momentum. Some such dC systems have
undergone a planetary nebula phase, and some may evolve to become CH, CEMP, or
Ba giants. Recent studies indicate that most dCs are likely from older,
metal-poor kinematic populations. Given the well-known anti-correlation of age
and activity, dCs would not be expected to show significant X-ray emission
related to coronal activity. However, accretion spin-up might be expected to
rejuvenate magnetic dynamos in these post mass-transfer binary systems. We

sector during winter is driven in part by the presence of quasi-persistent
regimes. However, general circulation models typically struggle to simulate
these, with e.g. an overly weakly persistent blocking regime. Previous studies
have showed that increased horizontal resolution can improve the regime
structure of a model, but have so far only considered a single model with only
one ensemble member at each resolution, leaving open the possibility that this
may be either coincidental or model-dependent. We show that the improvement in
regime structure due to increased resolution is robust across multiple models
with multiple ensemble members. However, while the high resolution models have
notably more tightly clustered data, other aspects of the regimes may not
necessarily improve, and are also subject to a large amount of sampling
variability that typically requires at least three ensemble members to
surmount.

Stereoscopic System (HESS) confirmed, that Cen~A is a very high-energy (VHE; $>
0.1$~TeV) $\gamma$-ray emitter with a known spectral {softening} in the energy
range from a few GeV to TeV. In this work, we consider a synchrotron
self-Compton model in the nucleus for the broad band spectrum {below the break
energy} and an external Compton model in kpc-scale jets for the $\gamma$-ray
excess. Our results show that the observed $\gamma$-ray excess can be suitably
described by the inverse Compton scattering of the starlight photons in the
kpc-scale jets, which is consistent with the recent tentative report by the
HESS on the spatial extension of the TeV emission along the jets. Considering
the spectral fitting results, the excess can only be seen in Cen~A, which is
probably due to two factors: (1) the host galaxy is approximately 50 times more
luminous than other typical radio galaxies and (2) the core $\gamma$-ray
spectrum quickly decays above a few MeV due to the low maximum electron Lorentz
factor of $\gamma_{\rm c}=2.8 \times 10^3$ resulting from the large magnetic
field of 3.8~G in the core. By the comparison with other $\gamma$-ray detected
radio galaxies, we found that the magnetic field strength of relativistic jets

data matrix into the sum of a low-rank matrix containing coherent structures
and a sparse matrix of outliers and corrupt entries. We apply RPCA filtering to
a range of fluid simulations and experiments of varying complexities and assess
the accuracy of low-rank structure recovery. First, we analyze direct numerical

artificial outliers, alongside similar PIV measurements at Reynolds number 413.
Next, we apply RPCA filtering to a turbulent channel flow simulation from the

law when it is put into a near-critical fluid mixture in the homogeneous phase
with the critical composition. The deviation ($\Delta\gamma_{\rm d}$) is
experimentally shown to depend approximately linearly on the correlation length
far from the particle ($\xi_\infty$), and is suggested to be caused by the
preferential attraction between one component and the particle surface. In
contrast, the dependence was shown to be much steeper in the previous
theoretical studies based on the Gaussian free-energy density. In the vicinity
of the particle, especially when the adsorption of the preferred component
makes the composition strongly off-critical, the correlation length becomes
very small as compared with $\xi_\infty$. This spacial inhomogeneity, not
considered in the previous theoretical studies, can influence the dependence of
$\Delta\gamma_{\rm d}$ on $\xi_\infty$. To examine this possibility, we here
apply the local renormalized functional theory, which was previously proposed
to explain the interaction of walls immersed in a (near-)critical binary fluid
mixture, describing the preferential attraction in terms of the surface field.
The free-energy density in this theory, coarse-grained up to the local
correlation length, has much complicated dependence on the order parameter, as
compared with the Gaussian free-energy density. Still, a concise expression of
the drag coefficient, which was derived in one of the previous theoretical
studies, turns out to be available in the present formulation. We show that, as
$\xi_{\infty}$ becomes larger, the dependence of $\Delta\gamma_{\rm d}$ on
$\xi_\infty$ becomes distinctly gradual and close to the linear dependence.

content-independent content-user-reaction model for social multimedia content
analysis. Compared to prior works that generally tackle semantic content
understanding and user behavior modeling in isolation, we propose a generalized
solution to these problems within a unified framework. We embed users, images
and text drawn from open social media in a common multimodal geometric space,
using a novel loss function designed to cope with distant and disparate
modalities, and thereby enable seamless three-way retrieval. Our model not only
outperforms unimodal embedding based methods on cross-modal retrieval tasks but
also shows improvements stemming from jointly solving the two tasks on Twitter
data. We also show that the user embeddings learned within our joint multimodal
embedding model are better at predicting user interests compared to those
learned with unimodal content on Instagram data. Our framework thus goes beyond
the prior practice of using explicit leader-follower link information to
establish affiliations by extracting implicit content-centric affiliations from
isolated users. We provide qualitative results to show that the user clusters
emerging from learned embeddings have consistent semantics and the ability of
our model to discover fine-grained semantics from noisy and unstructured data.
Our work reveals that social multimodal content is inherently multimodal and
possesses a consistent structure because in social networks meaning is created
through interactions between users and content.

circumference in order to determine where stable solutions exist. To carry out
this task, we use a unique set of computational tools based on dynamical system
theory that allow us to rapidly and accurately determine the stable region for
each cnoidal wave periodicity and to find the instability mechanisms and their
time scales. Finally, we focus on the soliton limit, and we show that the
stable region for single solitons almost completely overlaps the stable region
for both continuous waves and several higher-periodicity cnoidal waves that are
effectively multiple soliton trains. This result explains in part why it is
difficult to access single solitons deterministically.

we approach the Macdonald process identifying the space of symmetric functions
with a Fock representation of a Heisenberg algebra. By using the free field
realization of operators diagonalized by the Macdonald symmetric functions, we
propose a method of computing several correlation functions with respect to the
Macdonald process. It is well-known that expectation value of several
observables for the Macdonald process admit determinantal expression. We find
that this determinantal structure is apparent in free field realization of the
corresponding operators and, furthermore, it has a natural interpretation in
the language of free fermions at the Schur limit. We also propose a generalized

models. However, it has been so far limited to simple, shallow models or
low-dimensional data, due to the difficulty of computing the Hessian of
log-density functions. We show this difficulty can be mitigated by projecting
the scores onto random vectors before comparing them. This objective, called
sliced score matching, only involves Hessian-vector products, which can be
easily implemented using reverse-mode automatic differentiation. Therefore,
sliced score matching is amenable to more complex models and higher dimensional
data compared to score matching. Theoretically, we prove the consistency and
asymptotic normality of sliced score matching estimators. Moreover, we
demonstrate that sliced score matching can be used to learn deep score
estimators for implicit distributions. In our experiments, we show sliced score
matching can learn deep energy-based models effectively, and can produce
accurate score estimates for applications such as variational inference with
implicit distributions and training Wasserstein Auto-Encoders.

exchanges in the $t$-channel with their decays to $K\bar{K}$ pair allowed, the
exchanges of $\rho(775)+\omega(782)$ are excluded in contrast to existing model

$a_0(980)+\phi(1020)+f_2(1275)+a_2(1320)$ reggeized for the forward elastic
scattering amplitude together with Pomeron. The charge exchange reactions are
described by $a_0(980)+a_2(1320)$ exchanges in the $t$-channel. Dominance of
the isoscalar $f_2$ and Pomeron exchanges beyond $P_{\rm Lab}\approx3$ GeV/$c$

in charge exchange reactions play the respective roles in the low and high

appropriate countermeasures could be taken in time, before the system possibly
gets harmed. We propose a sequential and multivariate anomaly detection method
that scales well to high-dimensional datasets. The proposed method follows a
nonparametric, i.e., data-driven, and semi-supervised approach, i.e., trains
only on nominal data. Thus, it is applicable to a wide range of applications
and data types. Thanks to its multivariate nature, it can quickly and
accurately detect challenging anomalies, such as changes in the correlation
structure and stealth low-rate cyberattacks. Its asymptotic optimality and
computational complexity are comprehensively analyzed. In conjunction with the
detection method, an effective technique for localizing the anomalous data
dimensions is also proposed. We further extend the proposed detection and
localization methods to a supervised setup where an additional anomaly dataset
is available, and combine the proposed semi-supervised and supervised
algorithms to obtain an online learning algorithm under the semi-supervised
framework. The practical use of proposed algorithms are demonstrated in DDoS
attack mitigation, and their performances are evaluated using a real IoT-botnet

crucial for applications in photo-voltaics and flexible electronics. We study
the sensitivity of the electrical conductance of a silicon nanowire to changes
of charge states within an organic semiconductor physisorbed on the surface of
the nanowire. Elastic scattering caused by motion of charge carriers near the
nanowire modifies the mean-free path for backscattering of electrons
propagating within it, which we have mathematically expressed in terms of the
causal Green's functions. The scattering potential has been computed using a
combination of the polarizable continuum model and density functional theory
with the range-separated exchange-correlation functional for organic molecules
and the semi-empirical tight-binding model for silicon. As an example, the
sensitivity to charge state changes in tetracene is computed as a function of
operating temperature and geometrical parameters of a nanowire. For a single
molecule, ultra-thin silicon nanowires with characteristic sizes of the
cross-section below 2 nm produce a detectable conductance change at room
temperature. For larger nanowires the sensitivity is reduced, however the
conductance change grows with the number of charged molecules: with sub-4 nm
nanowires being sensitive enough to detect several tens of charge carriers. We
propose using noise spectroscopy to access the temporal evolution of the charge
states. Information regarding the spatial distribution of charge carries in
organic thin films can be obtained using a grid of nanowire resistors and
electric impedance tomography.

to its flexibility and support for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output

specifications of analog circuits are expected to be compromised, including the
resolution of analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and the linearity of
radio-frequency (RF) front end. Although the state-of-the-art studies focus on
the ADC, the nonlinearity can also lead to severe system performance
degradation when strong input signals introduce inter-modulation distortion
(IMD). The impact of RF nonlinearity becomes more severe with densely deployed
mmWave cells since signal sources closer to the receiver array are more likely
to occur. In this work, we design and analyze the digital IMD compensation
algorithm, and study the relaxation of the required linearity in the RF-chain.
We propose novel algorithms that jointly process digitized samples to recover
amplifier saturation, and relies on beam space operation which reduces the
computational complexity as compared to per-antenna IMD compensation.

preserve the decontextualization achieved by Kant's theory, Bohr seized on

propose a new backscatter-tag assisted vehicular positioning system where tags
are deployed along a roadside, which enables the extension of contact duration
and facilitates the maintenance. On the other hand, there is a location
mismatch between the vehicle and the tag, calling for developing a new
backscatter transmission to estimate their relative position. To this end, we
design a novel waveform called joint frequency-and-phase modulation (JFPM) for
backscatter-tag assisted vehicular positioning where a transmit frequency is
modulated for the distance estimation assuming that the relevant signal is
clearly differentiable from the others while the phase modulation helps the
differentiation. The JFPM waveform leads to exploiting the maximum
Degree-of-Freedoms (DoFs) of backscatter channel in which multiple-access and
broadcasting channels coexist, leading to more accurate positioning verified by
extensive simulations.

Here, we propose an optimization strategy capitalizing on dual interfaces
formed between glass-coat and metallic core (inner interface) and epoxy matrix
(outer interface), which can be decoupled to serve different purposes when
experiencing stress; outer interfacial modification is successfully applied
with inner interface condition preserved to maintain the crucial circular
domain structure for better sensitivity. We found out that the damage detection
capability is prescribed by periodical structural integrity parameterized by
cracks number and location in the case of damaged wires; it can also be
optimized by stress transfer efficiency with silane treated interface in the

properly conditioned dual-interfaces are promising for real-time monitoring in

\ldots, x_k$, respectively, want to evaluate a function $f(x_1, x_2, \ldots,
x_k)$ using as little communication as possible. We consider the
message-passing model, in which the inputs are partitioned in an arbitrary,
possibly worst-case manner, among a smaller number $t$ of players ($t<k$). The
$t$-player communication cost of computing $f$ can only be smaller than the
$k$-player communication cost, since the $t$ players can trivially simulate the
$k$-player protocol. But how much smaller can it be? We study deterministic and
randomized protocols in the one-way model, and provide separations for product
input distributions, which are optimal for low error probability protocols. We
also provide much stronger separations when the input distribution is
non-product.
  A key application of our results is in proving lower bounds for data stream
algorithms. In particular, we give an optimal $\Omega(\epsilon^{-2}\log(N) \log
\log(mM))$ bits of space lower bound for the fundamental problem of
$(1\pm\epsilon)$-approximating the number $\|x\|_0$ of non-zero entries of an
$n$-dimensional vector $x$ after $m$ integer updates each of magnitude at most
$M$, and with success probability $\ge 2/3$, in a strict turnstile stream. We
additionally prove the matching $\Omega(\epsilon^{-2}\log(N) \log \log(T))$
space lower bound for the problem when we have access to a heavy hitters oracle
with threshold $T$. Our results match the best known upper bounds when
$\epsilon\ge 1/\operatorname{polylog}(mM)$ and when $T =
2^{\operatorname{poly}(1/\epsilon)}$ respectively. It also improves on the
prior $\Omega(\epsilon^{-2}\log(mM) )$ lower bound and separates the complexity
of approximating $L_0$ from approximating the $p$-norm $L_p$ for $p$ bounded
away from $0$, since the latter has an $O(\epsilon^{-2}\log (mM))$ bit upper
bound.

This study proposes a method for generating time-series data based on GANs and

analyzed using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to represent the
relationship between input and generated data as canonical loadings. Using
these loadings, we can control the characteristics of the data generated by the
proposed method. The influence of class labels on generated data is analyzed by
feeding the data interpolated between two class labels into the generator of
the proposed GANs. The CCA of the latent variables is shown to be an effective
method of controlling the generated data characteristics. We are able to model
the distribution of the time-series data without requiring domain-dependent

  in Energy Markets with Retail Choice","e-Energy 2019 technical report",,,,"cs.DS math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Energy markets with retail choice enable customers to switch energy plans
among competitive retail suppliers. Despite the promising benefits of more
affordable prices and better savings to customers, there appears subsided
participation in energy retail markets from residential customers. One major
reason is the complex online decision-making process for selecting the best
energy plan from a multitude of options that hinders average consumers. In this
paper, we shed light on the online energy plan selection problem by providing
effective competitive online algorithms. We first formulate the online energy
plan selection problem as a metrical task system problem with temporally
dependent switching costs. For the case of constant cancellation fee, we
present a 3-competitive deterministic online algorithm and a 2-competitive
randomized online algorithm for solving the energy plan selection problem. We
show that the two competitive ratios are the best possible among deterministic
and randomized online algorithms, respectively. We further extend our online
algorithms to the case where the cancellation fee is linearly proportional to
the residual contract duration. Through empirical evaluations using real-world
household and energy plan data, we show that our deterministic online algorithm
can produce on average 14.6% cost saving, as compared to 16.2% by the offline
optimal algorithm, while our randomized online algorithm can further improve
cost saving by up to 0.5%.

Chern-Simons-matter theories, with $N_f$ matter superfields in the fundamental
representation of SU(N) or U(N). In the large N 't Hooft limit with fixed 't
Hooft coupling $\lambda$ these theories have one (for $N_f=1$) or two (for $N_f
> 1$) exactly marginal deformations in the superpotential. At finite N these
couplings acquire a beta function. We compute the beta function exactly for
$\lambda=0$, at leading order in 1/N. For $N_f=1$ we find four fixed points,
one of which is triply-degenerate. We show that at large N there are at most
six fixed points for any $\lambda$, and conjecture that there are exactly six,
with three of them stable (including a point with enhanced $\mathcal{N}=2$
supersymmetry). The strong-weak coupling dualities of $\mathcal{N}=1$
Chern-Simons-matter theories map each of these fixed points to a dual one. We
show that at large N the phase structure near each of the three stable fixed
points is different. For $N_f>1$ we analyze the fixed points at weak coupling,
and we work out the action of the strong-weak coupling duality on the marginal
and relevant superpotential couplings at large N (which was previously known
only for $N_f=1$). In addition, we compute in these theories the 2-point and
3-point functions of the lowest gauge-invariant singlet superfield at large N,
for all values of $\lambda$ and of the superpotential couplings, and use them
to test the large N dualities. This computation is one of the ingredients
needed for a computation of the beta function at order 1/N for all $\lambda$,
which we leave for future work. We also discuss Chern-Simons-matter theories
with extra Hubbard-Stratonovich type singlet fields, and suggest dualities
between them.

paths in the program under test in order to find bugs. Existing work has,
therefore, focused on guiding the exploration toward program parts that are
more likely to contain bugs by using an offline static analysis.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel technique for targeted greybox fuzzing
using an online static analysis that guides the fuzzer toward a set of target
locations, for instance, located in recently modified parts of the program.
This is achieved by first semantically analyzing each program path that is
explored by an input in the fuzzer's test suite. The results of this analysis
are then used to control the fuzzer's specialized power schedule, which
determines how often to fuzz inputs from the test suite. We implemented our
technique by extending a state-of-the-art, industrial fuzzer for Ethereum smart
contracts and evaluate its effectiveness on 27 real-world benchmarks. Using an
online analysis is particularly suitable for the domain of smart contracts
since it does not require any code instrumentation---instrumentation to
contracts changes their semantics. Our experiments show that targeted fuzzing
significantly outperforms standard greybox fuzzing for reaching 83% of the
challenging target locations (up to 14x of median speed-up).

We convert a pretrained WFST to a trainable neural network and adapt the system

replicate Viterbi decoding with forward--backward neural network computation,
which is similar to recurrent neural networks (RNNs). By pooling output score
sequences, a vocabulary posterior for each utterance is obtained and used for
discriminative loss computation. Experiments using 2--10 hours of
English/Japanese adaptation datasets indicate that the fine-tuning of only
WFSTs and that of only AMs are both comparable to a state-of-the-art adaptation
method, and E2E joint training of the two components achieves the best
recognition performance. We also adapt each language system to the other

unforeseeable risk one. These are unknown risks which can be of high

separating claim counts and severities, then propose a premium calculation
method, and finally a parameter estimation procedure. In the modelling we

relationships between the causes and the consequences of these interactions and
to make predictions. As the formalism of mathematical models offering
analytical solutions is often not suitable for representing social complexity,
more and more agent-based computer models are being used. For a long time, the
limited computing capacities of computers have hampered programming models that
would take into account the interactions between large numbers of
geographically located entities (persons or territories). In principle, these
models should inform the conditions for the emergence of certain patterns
defined at a macro-geographic level from the interactions occurring at a
micro-geographic level, in systems whose behaviors are too complex to be
understood directly by a human brain. Moreover, it is also necessary to analyze
the dynamic behavior of these models with nonlinear feedback effects and verify
that they produce plausible results at all stages of their simulation. This
essential work of exploring the dynamics of modeled systems remained in its
infancy until the late 2010s. Since then, algorithms combining more
sophisticated methods, including genetic algorithms and the use of distributed

reduce foreground bias that hinders power spectrum estimators, and the 21~cm

with two charged leptons and two neutrinos, using data collected during 2015
and 2016 in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb$^{-1}$. The integrated cross-sections in the
total and fiducial phase spaces are measured with an uncertainty of 7% and
compared with Standard Model predictions, and differential measurements in the
fiducial phase space are reported. No significant deviations from the Standard
Model predictions are observed, and stringent constraints are placed on
anomalous couplings corresponding to neutral triple gauge-boson interactions.

systems easily embrace a wider range of industrial areas, how to execute smart
contracts efficiently becomes a big challenge nowadays. Due to the existence of
Byzantine nodes, the mechanism of executing smart contracts is quite different
from that in database systems, so that existing successful concurrency control
protocols in database systems cannot be employed directly. Moreover, even
though smart contract execution follows a two-phase style, i.e, the miner node
executes a batch of smart contracts in the first phase and the validators
replay them in the second phase, existing parallel solutions only focus on the
optimization in the first phase, but not including the second phase.
  In this paper, we propose a novel efficient concurrency control scheme which
is the first one to do optimization in both phases. Specifically, (i) in the
first phase, we give a variant of OCC (Optimistic Concurrency Control) protocol
based on {\em batching} feature to improve the concurrent execution efficiency
for the miner and produce a schedule log with high parallelism for validators.
Also, a graph partition algorithm is devised to divide the original schedule
log into small pieces and further reduce the communication cost; and (ii) in
the second phase, we give a deterministic OCC protocol to replay all smart
contracts efficiently on multi-core validators where all cores can replay smart
contracts independently. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental
results illustrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-art solutions
significantly.

We show that this conventional wisdom is not universally applicable. When a

the fundamental reasons that cause many filtering algorithms to blur the edges.
Based on this insight, we propose a new Side Window Filtering (SWF) technique
which aligns the window's side or corner with the pixel being processed. The
SWF technique is surprisingly simple yet theoretically rooted and very
effective in practice. We show that many traditional linear and nonlinear
filters can be easily implemented under the SWF framework. Extensive analysis
and experiments show that implementing the SWF principle can significantly
improve their edge preserving capabilities and achieve state of the art
performances in applications such as image smoothing, denoising, enhancement,
structure-preserving texture-removing, mutual-structure extraction, and HDR
tone mapping. In addition to image filtering, we further show that the SWF
principle can be extended to other applications involving the use of a local
window. Using colorization by optimization as an example, we demonstrate that
implementing the SWF principle can effectively prevent artifacts such as color
leakage associated with the conventional implementation. Given the ubiquity of
window based operations in computer vision, the new SWF technique is likely to
benefit many more applications.

for such complex crack dynamics, and in particular for the non-monotonic
force-velocity curves commonly observed in mechanical tests on various

with the production and the diffusion of heat at the fracture tip. In this
framework, the rise in temperature only affects the sub-critical crack dynamics
and not the mechanical properties of the material. We show that this
description can quantitatively reproduce the rupture of two different polymeric
materials (namely, the mode I opening of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) plates,
and the peeling of pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) tapes), from the very slow
to the very fast fracturing regimes, over seven to nine decades of crack
propagation velocities. In particular, the fastest regime is obtained with an
increase of temperature of thousands of kelvins, on the molecular scale around
the crack tip. Although surprising, such an extreme temperature is actually
consistent with different experimental observations that accompany the fast
propagation of cracks, namely, fractoluminescence (i.e., the emission of
visible light during rupture) and a complex morphology of post-mortem fracture
surfaces, which could be due to the sublimation of bubbles.

be used to measure treatment effect early compared to the final clinical
outcome and to predict clinical benefit or harm. Such endpoints are assessed
for their predictive value of clinical benefit by investigating the surrogate
relationship between treatment effects on the surrogate and final outcomes
using meta-analytic methods. When surrogate relationships vary across treatment
classes, such validation may fail due to limited data within each treatment
class. In this paper, two alternative Bayesian meta-analytic methods are
introduced which allow for borrowing of information from other treatment
classes when exploring the surrogacy in a particular class. The first approach
extends a standard model for the evaluation of surrogate endpoints to a
hierarchical meta-analysis model assuming full exchangeability of surrogate
relationships across all the treatment classes, thus facilitating borrowing of
information across the classes. The second method is able to relax this
assumption by allowing for partial exchangeability of surrogate relationships
across treatment classes to avoid excessive borrowing of information from
distinctly different classes. We carried out a simulation study to assess the
proposed methods in nine data scenarios and compared them with subgroup
analysis using the standard model within each treatment class. We also applied
the methods to an illustrative example in colorectal cancer which led to
obtaining the parameters describing the surrogate relationships with higher

prosody contours, it is desirable to have a way of modeling the variation in
the prosodic aspects of speech, so audio signals can be synthesized in multiple
ways for a given text. We present a new, hierarchically structured conditional
variational autoencoder to generate prosodic features (fundamental frequency,
energy and duration) suitable for use with a vocoder or a generative model like
WaveNet. At inference time, an embedding representing the prosody of a sentence
may be sampled from the variational layer to allow for prosodic variation. To
efficiently capture the hierarchical nature of the linguistic input (words,
syllables and phones), both the encoder and decoder parts of the auto-encoder
are hierarchical, in line with the linguistic structure, with layers being
clocked dynamically at the respective rates. We show in our experiments that
our dynamic hierarchical network outperforms a non-hierarchical
state-of-the-art baseline, and, additionally, that prosody transfer across
sentences is possible by employing the prosody embedding of one sentence to
generate the speech signal of another.

annulus eccentricity. It was found that in a topologically closed system, such

can be created only in the form of fluxon-antifluxon pairs, the existence of a
steady viscous flow of Josephson vortices only relies on the capability of the

traveled at a range of angles and impact parameters for velocities between 0.1

work. The velocity dependence at low velocity displays clear linear behavior in
general, except for projectiles traveling perpendicular to graphitic layers,

degradation due to non-independent-and-identically-distributed (non-IID) data

trains an ML model using the rich data and computational resources of mobile
clients without gathering their data to central systems. The data of mobile
clients is typically non-IID owing to diversity among mobile clients' interests
and usage, and FL with non-IID data could degrade the model performance.
Therefore, to mitigate the degradation induced by non-IID data, we assume that
a limited number (e.g., less than 1%) of clients allow their data to be
uploaded to a server, and we propose a hybrid learning mechanism referred to as
Hybrid-FL, wherein the server updates the model using the data gathered from
the clients and aggregates the model with the models trained by clients. The
Hybrid-FL solves both client- and data-selection problems via heuristic
algorithms, which try to select the optimal sets of clients who train models
with their own data, clients who upload their data to the server, and data
uploaded to the server. The algorithms increase the number of clients
participating in FL and make more data gather in the server IID, thereby
improving the prediction accuracy of the aggregated model. Evaluations, which
consist of network simulations and ML experiments, demonstrate that the
proposed scheme achieves a 13.5% higher classification accuracy than those of
the previously proposed schemes for the non-IID case.

droplets on striped surfaces. We first consider the equilibrium properties of
droplets on different surfaces, we show that for small stripes the
Cassie-Baxter equation gives a good approximation of the equilibrium contact
angle. As the stripe width becomes non-negligible compared to the dimension of
the droplets, the droplet has to deform significantly to minimize its free
energy, this results in a smaller value of the contact angle than the continuum
model predicts. We then evaluate the slip length, and thus the damping
coefficient as a function of the stripe width. For very small stripes, the
heterogeneous surface behaves as an effective surface, with the same damping as
an homogeneous surface with the same contact angle. However, as the stripe
width increases, damping at the surface increases until reaching a plateau.
Afterwards, we study the dynamics of droplets under a bulk force. We show that
if the stripes are large enough the droplets are pinned until a critical
acceleration. The critical acceleration increases linearly with stripe width.
For large enough accelerations, the average velocity increases linearly with
the acceleration, we show that it can then be predicted by a model depending
only the size of droplet, viscosity and slip length. We show that the velocity
of the droplet varies sinusoidally as a function of its position on the
substrate. On the other hand, for accelerations just above the depinning
acceleration we observe a characteristic stick-slip motion, with successive
pinnings and depinnings.

surface brightness vs. radius and hence the nebular size as function of energy.
It also predicts the X-ray spectral index at different radii from the central
pulsar, depending on the nebular B-field profile and particle transport
properties. We apply the code to PWN G0.9+0.1 and fit these three functions
concurrently, thus maximizing the constraining power of the data. We use a
Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) method to find best-fit parameters with
accompanying errors. This approach should allow us to better probe the spatial
behaviour of the bulk-particle motion, the $B$-field and diffusion coefficient,
and break degeneracies between different model parameters. Our model will
contribute to interpreting results by the future Cherenkov Telescope Array
(CTA) that will yield many more discoveries plus morphological details of
very-high-energy Galactic PWNe.

various Li and Nd co-doped ZnO ceramics have been synthesized through the

formation of wurtzite hexagonal structured ZnO having space group P63mc.
Meanwhile, FESEM micrographs confirm the formation of randomly aligned

field structures of 18 ICME magnetic flux ropes observed by radially aligned
spacecraft in the inner heliosphere. Similarity in the underlying flux rope
structures is determined through the application of a simple technique that
maps the magnetic field profile from one spacecraft to the other. In many
cases, the flux ropes show very strong underlying similarities at the different
spacecraft. The mapping technique reveals similarities that are not readily
apparent in the unmapped data and is a useful tool when determining whether
magnetic field time series observed at different spacecraft are associated with
the same ICME. Lundquist fitting has been applied to the flux ropes and the
rope orientations have been determined; macroscale differences in the profiles
at the aligned spacecraft may be ascribed to differences in flux rope
orientation. Assuming that the same region of the ICME was observed by the
aligned spacecraft in each case, the fitting indicates some weak tendency for
the rope axes to reduce in inclination relative to the solar equatorial plane
and to align with the solar east-west direction with heliocentric distance.

may consider that the agent follows the overarching objective to generate
sequences of distinct activities. To achieve a balanced distribution of
activities would then be the primary goal, and not to master a specific task.
In this setting, the agent would show two types of behaviors, task-oriented,
and task-searching phases, with the latter interseeding the former.
  We study the emergence of autonomous task switching for the case of a
simulated robot arm. Grasping one of several moving objects corresponds in this
setting to a specific activity. Overall, the arm should follow a given object
temporarily and then move away, in order to search for a new target and
reengage. We show that this behavior can be generated robustly when modeling
the arm as an adaptive dynamical system. The dissipation function is in this
approach time dependent. The arm is in a dissipative state when searching for a
nearby object, dissipating energy on approach. Once close, the dissipation
function starts to increase, with the eventual sign change implying that the
arm will take up energy and wander off. The resulting explorative state ends
when the dissipation function becomes again negative and the arm selects a new
target. We believe that our approach may be generalized to generate
self-organized sequences of activities in general.

  Reinforcement Learning","8 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Off-policy reinforcement learning with eligibility traces is challenging
because of the discrepancy between target policy and behavior policy. One
common approach is to measure the difference between two policies in a
probabilistic way, such as importance sampling and tree-backup. However,
existing off-policy learning methods based on probabilistic policy measurement
are inefficient when utilizing traces under a greedy target policy, which is
ineffective for control problems. The traces are cut immediately when a
non-greedy action is taken, which may lose the advantage of eligibility traces
and slow down the learning process. Alternatively, some non-probabilistic
measurement methods such as General Q($\lambda$) and Naive Q($\lambda$) never
cut traces, but face convergence problems in practice. To address the above
issues, this paper introduces a new method named TBQ($\sigma$), which
effectively unifies the tree-backup algorithm and Naive Q($\lambda$). By
introducing a new parameter $\sigma$ to illustrate the \emph{degree} of
utilizing traces, TBQ($\sigma$) creates an effective integration of
TB($\lambda$) and Naive Q($\lambda$) and continuous role shift between them.
The contraction property of TB($\sigma$) is theoretically analyzed for both
policy evaluation and control settings. We also derive the online version of
TBQ($\sigma$) and give the convergence proof. We empirically show that, for
$\epsilon\in(0,1]$ in $\epsilon$-greedy policies, there exists some degree of
utilizing traces for $\lambda\in[0,1]$, which can improve the efficiency in
trace utilization for off-policy reinforcement learning, to both accelerate the
learning process and improve the performance.

that manages the exchange and remuneration of electricity between consumers,
prosumers and the local electric grid provider in the absence of

being implemented in the town of Walenstadt, Switzerland, with 37 participating
households. The community members of this pilot project pay a reduced tariff
for grid usage if the electricity produced by a prosumer is sold to another
community member, which is located on the same voltage or grid level downstream
a substation1. Such a tariff structure incentivizes local balancing, i.e.
locally produced energy can be consumed locally whenever possible to avoid
costs from higher grid levels. The blockchain is a novel technology suitable to
log the produced and consumed units of energy within a community, making it
possible to implement market places. In those marketplaces, both prosumers and
consumers can indicate a price at which they are willing to sell / buy locally
produced solar energy without the intermediation of a utility. The key goals of
this project are the assessment of A) the technical, economical and ecological
feasibility of a blockchain-based community energy system regarding local
utilization of solar energy, grid quality and energy efficiency and B)
resulting dynamics regarding local market prices and user acceptance.

approach that incorporates roughness effects and interactions between the

derived using experimental data and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations,
respectively. Roughness effects, such as atomic steps or terraces appearing in
mineral surfaces result in very different effective inter-nanoparticle

roughness is connected to the short length scale of the adhesive attraction
arising from the ordering of water layers confined between calcite surfaces.
Particles with smooth surfaces feature strong adhesive forces, and form gel
fractal structures, while small surface roughness, of the order of atomic steps
in mineral faces, stabilize the suspension. We believe that our work helps to
rationalize the contrasting experimental results that have been obtained
recently using nanoparticles or extended surfaces, which provide support for
the existence of adhesive or repulsive interactions, respectively. We further
use our model to analyze the synergistic effects of roughness, pH and ion

reconstruction of 3D objects. At the same time, generative models were proposed
that can generate highly realistic images. However, despite this success in
these closely related tasks, texture reconstruction of 3D objects has received
little attention from the research community and state-of-the-art methods are
either limited to comparably low resolution or constrained experimental setups.
A major reason for these limitations is that common representations of texture
are inefficient or hard to interface for modern deep learning techniques. In
this paper, we propose Texture Fields, a novel texture representation which is
based on regressing a continuous 3D function parameterized with a neural
network. Our approach circumvents limiting factors like shape discretization
and parameterization, as the proposed texture representation is independent of
the shape representation of the 3D object. We show that Texture Fields are able
to represent high frequency texture and naturally blend with modern deep
learning techniques. Experimentally, we find that Texture Fields compare
favorably to state-of-the-art methods for conditional texture reconstruction of
3D objects and enable learning of probabilistic generative models for texturing
unseen 3D models. We believe that Texture Fields will become an important
building block for the next generation of generative 3D models.

fluids with lower and higher yield stress is investigated at multiple Reynolds
numbers $Re^* \in$ (1, 200) and Bingham numbers $Bi \in$ (0.01, 0.35). A
secondary flow consisting of eight vortices is observed to recirculate the
fluid from the corners to the core. Their extent and intensity grows with
increasing $Re^*$. The second objective of this study is to explore the change
in flow in the presence of particles. Almost neutrally-buoyant finite-size
spherical particles with duct height, $2H$, to particle diameter, $d_p$, ratio
of 12 are used at two volume fractions $\phi$ = 5 and 10\%. Particle Tracking
Velocimetry (PTV) is used to measure the velocity of these
refractive-index-matched spheres, and PIV to extract the fluid velocity. Simple
shadowgraphy is also used for qualitatively visualising the development of the
particle distribution along the streamwise direction. The particle distribution
pattern changes from being concentrated at the four corners, at low flow rates,
to being focussed along a diffused ring between the center and the corners, at
high flow rates. The presence of particles induces streamwise and wall-normal
velocity fluctuations in the fluid phase; however, the primary Reynolds shear
stress is still very small compared to turbulent flows. The size of the plug in
the particle-laden cases appears to be smaller than the corresponding single
phase cases. Similar to Newtonian fluids, the friction factor increases due to
the presence of particles, almost independently of the suspending fluid matrix.
Interestingly, predictions based on an increased effective suspension viscosity
agrees quite well with the experimental friction factor for the concentrations
used in this study.

long time periods. There is a growing trend of attackers using off-the-shelf
tools and pre-installed system applications (such as \emph{powershell} and
\emph{wmic}) to evade the detection because the same tools are also used by
system administrators and security analysts for legitimate purposes for their
routine tasks. To start investigations, event logs can be collected from
operational systems; however, these logs are generic enough and it often
becomes impossible to attribute a potential attack to a specific attack group.
Recent approaches in the literature have used anomaly detection techniques,
which aim at distinguishing between malicious and normal behavior of computers
or network systems. Unfortunately, anomaly detection systems based on point
anomalies are too rigid in a sense that they could miss the malicious activity
and classify the attack, not an outlier. Therefore, there is a research
challenge to make better detection of malicious activities. To address this
challenge, in this paper, we leverage Group Anomaly Detection (GAD), which
detects anomalous collections of individual data points.
  Our approach is to build a neural network model utilizing Adversarial
Autoencoder (AAE-$\alpha$) in order to detect the activity of an attacker who
leverages off-the-shelf tools and system applications. In addition, we also
build \textit{Behavior2Vec} and \textit{Command2Vec} sentence embedding deep
learning models specific for feature extraction tasks. We conduct extensive
experiments to evaluate our models on real-world datasets collected for a

line emission from the inner region of the nearby infrared luminous galaxy IC

of IC 860, with brightness temperatures $T_{\rm B}>$ 280 K. The 45 GHz
continuum is equally compact, but fainter in flux. We suggest that the 3 to 0.8
mm continuum is opaque at mm-wavelengths, implying a very large H$_2$ column
density $N$(H$_2$) of 1e26 cm-2, and that it emerges from hot dust with

$\nu_2$=1f J=4-3 and 3-2 (HCN-VIB) are seen in emission and resolved on scales
of 40-50 pc. The HCN-VIB emission reveals a north-south nuclear velocity
gradient with projected rotation velocities of v=100 kms$^{-1}$ at r=10 pc. The
brightest HCN-VIB emission is oriented perpendicular to the velocity gradient.
Ground state lines of HCN 3-2, 4-3, HC$^{15}$N 4-3, HCO$^+$ 3-2, 4-3 and CS

red-shifted, reversed P-Cygni profiles consistent with gas inflows of $\sim$50
kms$^{-1}$. The absorption features can be traced from the north-east into the
nucleus. In contrast, CS 7-6 shows blue-shifted line wings extending to -180
kms$^{-1}$. We suggest that a dense and slow outflow is hidden behind a
foreground layer of inflowing gas.
  It appears that the centre of IC 860 is in a phase of rapid evolution where
an inflow is building up the nuclear column density of gas. A slow, dense
outflow may be signalling the onset of feedback. The inner, r=10 pc, IR

The galaxy pair sample is selected from the main galaxy sample of Sloan Digital

spectral and GAMA surveys. We find the BLFs depend on the projected distance
$d_{\text{p}}$ between pair members. At large separation $d_{\text{p}} > 150
h^{-1}\ \text{kpc}$, the BLF degenerates into a luminosity function (LF) of
single galaxies, indicating few interactions between pair members. At $100
h^{-1}\ \text{kpc} \leq d_{\text{p}} \leq 150 h^{-1}\ \text{kpc}$, the BLF
starts to show the correlation between pair members, in the sense that the
shape of the conditional luminosity function (CLF) of one member galaxy starts
to depend on the luminosity of the other member galaxy. Specifically, the CLF
with a brighter companion has a steeper faint-end slope, which becomes even
more significant at $50 h^{-1}\ \text{kpc} \leq d_{\text{p}} \leq 100 h^{-1}\
\text{kpc}$. This behavior is consistent with the scenario, \textit{and also is
the observational evidence}, that dynamic friction drives massive major merger
pairs to merge more quickly. At close distance $d_{\text{p}} \leq 50 h^{-1}\
\text{kpc}$, besides the merging time-scale effect, the BLF also shows an
overall brightening of $\Delta M_r \geq 0.04$ mag, which reveals the enhanced
star formation of the close-pair phase. By combining another statistical
conclusion that the star formation rate of late-type galaxies in close pairs is
enhanced at a level of about 40\%, we further conclude that the average
starburst time-scale of close pairs is as long as 0.4 Gyr.

in terms of the displayed morphological features, such as prominent/abundant
nucleoli and a colony with a tightly packed appearance and a well-defined edge.
Using image analysis and computational tools, we precisely quantify these
properties using phase-contrast images of hESC colonies of different sizes (0.1
-- 1.1$\, \text{mm}^2$) during days 2, 3 and 4 after plating. Our analyses
reveal noticeable differences in their structure influenced directly by the
colony area $A$. Large colonies ($A > 0.6 \, \text{mm}^2$) have cells with
smaller nuclei and a short intercellular distance when compared with small
colonies ($A < 0.2 \, \text{mm}^2$). The gaps between the cells, which are
present in small and medium sized colonies with $A \le 0.6 \, \text{mm}^2$,
disappear in large colonies ($A > 0.6 \, \text{mm}^2$) due to the proliferation
of the cells in the bulk. This increases the colony density and the number of
nearest neighbours.
  We also detect the self-organisation of cells in the colonies where newly
divided (smallest) cells cluster together in patches, separated from larger
cells at the final stages of the cell cycle. This might influence directly
cell-to-cell interactions and the community effects within the colonies since
the segregation induced by size differences allows the interchange of
neighbours as the cells proliferate and the colony grows. Our findings are
relevant to efforts to determine the quality of hESC colonies and establish

different colloidal gels submitted to ultrasonic vibrations (with submicron

micron-sized cracks within the gel network that may or may not fully heal once
vibrations are turned off depending on the acoustic intensity. Ultrasonic
vibrations are further shown to dramatically decrease the gel yield stress and
accelerate shear-induced fluidization. Ultrasound-assisted fluidization
dynamics appear to be governed by an effective temperature that depends on the
acoustic intensity. Our work opens the way to a full control of elastic and

interest in these large InSAR datasets has already been demonstrated, but
data-driven techniques, such as convolutional neutral networks (CNN) require
balanced training datasets of positive and negative signals to effectively
differentiate between real deformation and noise. As only a small proportion of
volcanoes are deforming and atmospheric noise is ubiquitous, the use of machine
learning for detecting volcanic unrest is more challenging. In this paper, we
address this problem using synthetic interferograms to train the AlexNet. The
synthetic interferograms are composed of 3 parts: 1) deformation patterns based
on a Monte Carlo selection of parameters for analytic forward models, 2)
stratified atmospheric effects derived from weather models and 3) turbulent
atmospheric effects based on statistical simulations of correlated noise. The
AlexNet architecture trained with synthetic data outperforms that trained using
real interferograms alone, based on classification accuracy and positive
predictive value (PPV). However, the models used to generate the synthetic
signals are a simplification of the natural processes, so we retrain the CNN
with a combined dataset consisting of synthetic models and selected real
examples, achieving a final PPV of 82%. Although applying atmospheric
corrections to the entire dataset is computationally expensive, it is
relatively simple to apply them to the small subset of positive results. This
further improves the detection performance without a significant increase in
computational burden.

plays a key role in determining the efficiency of electronic devices made of
next generation semiconductors such as organic, perovskite and nanocrystals. In
this work, we show that lowering the bulk recombination does not necessarily
result in enhanced performance metrics of electronic devices. From the
perspective of charge carrier extraction and injection, the radiative limit of
the open-circuit voltage of solar cells, noise current of photodetectors and
lasing threshold of injection lasers cannot be improved if the contacts are not
perfectly selective. A numerical drift-diffusion model is used to investigate
the interplay between bulk recombination and surface recombination of minority
carriers at the contacts in bipolar thin diode devices based on low-mobility
semiconductors. The surface recombination becomes prominent in case of reduced
bulk recombination strengths when non-selective contacts, i. e. contacts that
are either metallic or have imperfect charge-selective interlayer, are
employed. Finally, we derive analytical approximations for the case when
diffusion-limited surface recombination of minority carriers at Ohmic contacts
dominates the dark current. These results indicate that having perfectly
selective contacts becomes crucial in systems with suppressed bulk
recombination - a challenging requirement for future state-of-the-art thin-film
solar cells, light-emitting devices and photodetectors made of next generation

to avoid ambiguous classification and reduce the cost of misclassification.
Previous abstaining classification models rely on cost information, such as a
cost matrix or cost ratio. However, it is difficult to obtain or estimate costs
in practical applications. Furthermore, these abstention models are typically
restricted to a single optimization metric, which may not be the expected
indicator when evaluating classification performance. To overcome such
problems, a multi-objective bounded-abstention (MOBA) model is proposed to
optimize essential metrics. Specifically, the MOBA model minimizes the error
rate of each class under class-dependent abstention constraints. The MOBA model
is then solved using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, which is a
popular evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm. A set of
Pareto-optimal solutions will be generated and the best one can be selected
according to provided conditions (whether costs are known) or performance
demands (e.g., obtaining a high accuracy, F-measure, and etc). Hence, the MOBA
model is robust towards variations in the conditions and requirements. Compared
to state-of-the-art abstention models, MOBA achieves lower expected costs when
cost information is considered, and better performance-abstention trade-offs
when it is not.

how future measurements can be incorporated in such a framework, through the

predictability on the encoding of linguistic content manifested by speaker
choice in a classifier language. In English, a numeral modifies a noun directly
(e.g., three computers). In classifier languages such as Mandarin Chinese, it
is obligatory to use a classifier (CL) with the numeral and the noun (e.g.,
three CL.machinery computer, three CL.general computer). While different nouns
are compatible with different specific classifiers, there is a general
classifier ""ge"" (CL.general) that can be used with most nouns. When the
upcoming noun is less predictable, the use of a more specific classifier would
reduce surprisal at the noun thus potentially facilitate comprehension
(predicted by Uniform Information Density, Levy & Jaeger, 2007), but the use of
that more specific classifier may be dispreferred from a production standpoint
if accessing the general classifier is always available (predicted by

properties of geometric figures in the plane, e.g. curves or polygons. In
particular, the {\it domination problem} tries to find the minimum number of
points that are able to dominate the whole set, the so called, {\it domination
number}. Alternatively, other problems try to determine the subsets of points
with a given cardinality, that maximize the basin of domination, the {\it
partial dominating set}. Since a discrete time series can be viewed as an
ordered set of points in the plane, the dominating number and the partial
dominating set can be used to obtain additional information about the
visibility properties of the series; in particular, the total visibility number
and the partial visibility set. In this paper, we apply these two concepts to
study times series that are generated from the logistic map. More specifically,
we focus this work on the description of the Feigenbaum cascade to the onset of
chaos. We show that the whole cascade has the same total visibility number,
$v_T=1/4$. However, a different distribution of the partial visibility sets and
the corresponding partial visibility curves can be obtained inside both
periodic and chaotic regimes. We prove that the partial visibility curve at the
Feigenbaum accumulation point $r_{\infty} \approx 3.5699$ is the limit curve of
the partial visibility curves ($n+1$-polygonals) that correspond to the periods
$T=2^{n}$ for $n=1,2,\ldots$. We analytically calculate the length of these
$n+1$-polygonals and, as a limit, we obtain the length of the partial
visibility curve at the onset of chaos, $L_{\infty} = L(r_{\infty}) \approx
1.0414387863$. Finally, we compare these results with those obtained from the
period 3-cascade, and with the partial visibility curve of the chaotic series
at the crossing point $r_c \approx 3.679$.

the electronic coupling between the molecular constituents, which is heavily

quinacridone, with its multiple, structurally fundamentally different
polymorphs and their diverse intermolecular interactions an ideal test case for
analyzing the correlation between the electronic coupling in a specific
configuration and the configuration's energetic stability. To provide an
in-depth analysis of this correlation, starting from the $\alpha$-polymorph of

systematically compare the displacement-dependence of the electronic coupling
with that of the total energy. In this way, we identify the combination of
Pauli repulsion and orbital rehybridization as the driving force steering the
system towards a structure in which the electronic coupling is minimal
(especially for the valence band and at small displacements). The general
nature of these observations is supported by equivalent trends for an analogous
pentacene model system. This underlines that the design of high-performance
materials cannot rely on the ""natural"" assembly of the $\pi$-conjugated
backbones of organic semiconductors into their most stable configurations.
Rather, it must include the incorporation of functional groups that steer
crystal packing towards more favorable structures, where aiming for short-axis
displacements or realizing comparably large long-axis displacements appear as
strategies worthwhile exploring.

past X-ray detection up to 10 keV, prompted high energy X-ray observations as

leptonic models can explain the broadband emission, but also imply a diffuse
X-ray nebula of similar extent to the radio and TeV nebulae, which cannot be
confirmed by our observations. The hadronic models can simultaneously explain
the spectrum and the spatial extent in all wavelengths; however, we need a very
high magnetic field strength pervading the radio and TeV nebulae and a

for implementation of the conditioned states close to SCSs with use of
linear-optics elements and detectors projecting unitarily transformed input

the destination can maximize a utility function which represents the task to be
executed only knowing the quantized information. For example, for utility
functions under the form $u\left(\boldsymbol{x};\ \boldsymbol{g}\right)$,
$\boldsymbol{x}$ might represent a decision in terms of using some radio
resources and $\boldsymbol{g}$ the system state which is only observed through
its quantized version $Q(\boldsymbol{g})$. Both in the case where the utility
function is known and the case where it is only observed through its
realizations, we provide solutions to determine such a quantizer. We show how
this approach applies to energy-efficient power allocation. In particular, it
is seen that quantizing the state very roughly is perfectly suited to
sum-rate-type function maximization, whereas energy-efficiency metrics are more
sensitive to imperfections.

However, the field solution of theories exhibiting Vainshtein screening is only
known in spherically symmetric situations. In this article we examine in
different configurations the two-body potential energy of pointlike particles

Vainshtein screening is also fully active in the equal-mass case, the nonlinear

discover good matches between pairs of entities or individuals. Formally, the
set of individuals is represented by the nodes of a graph where the edges,
unobserved at first, represent the good matches. The algorithm queries pairs of
nodes and observes the presence/absence of edges. Its goal is to discover as
many edges as possible with a fixed budget of queries. Pair-matching is a
particular instance of multi-armed bandit problem in which the arms are pairs
of individuals and the rewards are edges linking these pairs. This bandit
problem is non-standard though, as each arm can only be played once.
  Given this last constraint, sublinear regret can be expected only if the
graph presents some underlying structure. This paper shows that sublinear
regret is achievable in the case where the graph is generated according to a
Stochastic Block Model (SBM) with two communities. Optimal regret bounds are
computed for this pair-matching problem. They exhibit a phase transition
related to the Kesten-Stigum threshold for community detection in SBM. The
pair-matching problem is considered in the case where each node is constrained
to be sampled less than a given amount of times. We show how optimal regret
rates depend on this constraint. The paper is concluded by a conjecture
regarding the optimal regret when the number of communities is larger than 2.
Contrary to the two communities case, we argue that a statistical-computational
gap would appear in this problem.

for life. Over the $\sim$4 Gyr history of Earth, the total energy incident at
the top of the atmosphere and within the biological available window is

would suggest that planets orbiting other stars should not show signs of
complex life if the total energy incident on the planet is below this energy
threshold. The proportional evolutionary time hypothesis predicts that late K-

important component in many critical domains such as social networks, biology,
and cyber-security. This development motivated research to develop faster
algorithms that target graph pattern matching. In recent years, the database
community has shown that mapping graph pattern matching problems to a new class
of relational join algorithms provides an efficient framework for computing
these problems.
  In this paper, we argue that this new class of relational join algorithms is
highly amenable to specialized hardware acceleration thanks to two fundamental
properties: improved locality and inherent concurrency. The improved locality
is a result of the provably bound number of intermediate results these
algorithms generate, which results in smaller working sets. In addition, their
inherent concurrency can be leveraged for effective hardware acceleration and
hiding memory latency. We demonstrate the hardware amenability of this new
class of algorithms by introducing TrieJax, a hardware accelerator for graph
pattern matching. The TrieJax design leverages the improved locality and high
concurrency properties to dramatically accelerate graph pattern matching, and
can be tightly integrated into existing manycore processors.
  We evaluate TrieJax on a set standard graph pattern matching queries and
datasets. Our evaluation shows that TrieJax outperforms recently proposed
hardware accelerators for graph and database processing that do not employ the
new class of algorithms by 7-63x on average (up to 539x), while consuming
15-179x less energy (up to 1750x). systems that do incorporate modern

\citep{Tartakovsky2018} as an alternative to the (macroscale) Young-Laplace
law. The nonlocal model is obtained in the form of an integral of a
molecular-force-like function with support $\varepsilon$ added to the
Navier-Stokes momentum conservation equation. Using this model, we calculate
analytical forms for the steady-state equilibrium pressure gradient and
pressure profile for circular and spherical bubbles and flat interfaces in two
and three dimensions. According to the analytical solutions, the pressure
changes continuously across the interface in a way that is quantitatively
similar to what is observed in MD simulations. Furthermore, the pressure
difference $P_{\varepsilon, in} - P_{\varepsilon, out}$ satisfies the
Young-Laplace law for the radius of curvature greater than $3\varepsilon$ and
deviates from the Young-Laplace law otherwise (i.e., $P_{\varepsilon, in} -
P_{\varepsilon, out}$ goes to zero as the radius of the curvature goes to zero,
where $P_{\varepsilon, out}$ is the pressure outside of the bubble at the
distance greater than $3\varepsilon$ from the interface and $P_{\varepsilon,
in}$ is the pressure at the center of the bubble). The latter indicates that
the surface tension in the proposed model decreases with the decreasing radius
of curvature, which agrees with molecular dynamics simulations and laboratory
experiments with nanobubbles. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the
nonlocal model behaves microscopically at scales smaller than $\varepsilon$ and
macroscopically, otherwise.

approximately 60% of the training time required by the state of the art while
achieving slightly larger classification accuracy. We then focus on the CNN

emitting Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies, to model the radio emission of FSRQs
as a function of mass alone, assuming a near-Eddington accretion rate, which is
suggested by current quasar surveys at z > 6. This is used to determine the
smallest visible black hole mass as a function of redshift in two competing
cosmologies we compare in this paper: the standard LCDM model and the R_h=ct

function at $z=6$ in order to devolve that population to higher redshifts and
determine the number of FSRQs detectable by the SKA surveys as a function of z.
We find that at the redshifts for which this method is most valid, LCDM
predicts ~30 times more FSRQs than R_h=ct for the Wide survey, and ~100 times
more in the Medium-Deep survey. These stark differences will allow the SKA
surveys to strongly differentiate between these two models, possibly rejecting
one in comparison with the other at a high level of confidence.

application scenarios. In order to extend the applications' boundaries to some
accuracy-crucial domains, researchers have been investigating approaches to
boost accuracy through either deeper or wider network structures, which brings
with them the exponential increment of the computational and storage cost,
delaying the responding time. In this paper, we propose a general training
framework named self distillation, which notably enhances the performance
(accuracy) of convolutional neural networks through shrinking the size of the
network rather than aggrandizing it. Different from traditional knowledge
distillation - a knowledge transformation methodology among networks, which
forces student neural networks to approximate the softmax layer outputs of
pre-trained teacher neural networks, the proposed self distillation framework
distills knowledge within network itself. The networks are firstly divided into
several sections. Then the knowledge in the deeper portion of the networks is
squeezed into the shallow ones. Experiments further prove the generalization of
the proposed self distillation framework: enhancement of accuracy at average
level is 2.65%, varying from 0.61% in ResNeXt as minimum to 4.07% in VGG19 as
maximum. In addition, it can also provide flexibility of depth-wise scalable

"1905.08095","Mohamadreza Ahmadi","Mohamadreza Ahmadi, Nils Jansen, Bo Wu, and Ufuk Topcu","Control Theory Meets POMDPs: A Hybrid Systems Approach","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1810.00093",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a modeling
framework for a variety of sequential decision making under uncertainty
scenarios in artificial intelligence (AI). Since the states are not directly
observable in a POMDP, decision making has to be performed based on the output
of a Bayesian filter (continuous beliefs). Hence, POMDPs are often
computationally intractable to solve exactly and researchers resort to
approximate methods often using discretizations of the continuous belief space.
These approximate solutions are, however, prone to discretization errors, which
has made POMDPs ineffective in applications, wherein guarantees for safety,
optimality, or performance are required. To overcome the complexity challenge
of POMDPs, we apply notions from control theory. The goal is to determine the
reachable belief space of a POMDP, that is, the set of all possible evolutions
given an initial belief distribution over the states and a set of actions and
observations. We begin by casting the problem of analyzing a POMDP into
analyzing the behavior of a discrete-time switched system. For estimating the
reachable belief space, we find over-approximations in terms of sub-level sets
of Lyapunov functions. Furthermore, in order to verify safety and optimality
requirements of a given POMDP, we formulate a barrier certificate theorem,
wherein we show that if there exists a barrier certificate satisfying a set of
inequalities along with the belief update equation of the POMDP, the safety and
optimality properties are guaranteed to hold. In both cases, we show how the
calculations can be decomposed into smaller problems that can be solved in
parallel. The conditions we formulate can be computationally implemented as a
set of sum-of-squares programs. We illustrate the applicability of our method
by addressing two problems in active ad scheduling and machine teaching.

to 64-bits processors systems. Several symmetric cryptographic algorithm
already exist such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RC4, Blowfish, etc.
In this work, we propose an 8-bits encryption algorithm, combining several
ideas of standard symmetric encryption algorithms. The aim is to provide a
efficient, modular and compact algorithm able to tend to truly random
one-time-pad encryption quality even for large data flux. The algorithm
combines the implementation of a divergent polynomial with variable
coefficients for pseudo-random keys generation, variable bit swapping and
bitwise operations on data, and the use of one or two passwords. The encryption
has been evaluated statistically, tested for image encryption and compared with
One-Time-Pad encryption on the same data. Three implementations have been
tested respectively in C, Javascript and GNU Octave. Encryption time
performances are compared with AES on a 8-bits architecture: the Arduino Uno
(ATmega328) microcontroller. A new concept of self-decryptionable web encrypted
object, called Blocksnet is also presented and tested as a potential
application of the compact and embedded PMSE algorithm.

measures in orthogonal projections from the complex line of a quantum state to
eigenspaces of an observable. Unit total probability corresponds to a complex
Pythagorean theorem: the measure of a subset of the complex line is the sum of
the measures of its projections on all eigenspaces. To show that projection
factors can work as probabilities, we postulate the existence of a continuum
infinity of identical quantum universes, all with the same quasi-classical
worlds. In a measurement, these factors give the relative amounts of worlds
with each result, which we associate to frequentist and Bayesian probabilities.
This solves the probability problem of Everett's theory, allowing its preferred
basis problem to be solved as well, and may help settle questions about the
nature of probability.

axial-symmetric processes should be presented in a way to enhance the
correlation pattern whereas the non-symmetric process should be plotted
elsewhere in order to reduce the correlation background. In this article, three
possible coordinate systems, which were previously adopted in the literature,
are described and compared to each other. The consistency of these systems is
evaluated based on the real experimental data analysis for the 10.29-MeV state

  Recommendations",,,,,"cs.CY cs.IR cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bike usage in Smart Cities becomes paramount for sustainable urban
development. Cycling provides tremendous opportunities for a more healthy
lifestyle, lower energy consumption and carbon emissions as well as reduction
of traffic jams. While the number of cyclists increase along with the expansion
of bike sharing initiatives and infrastructures, the number of bike accidents
rises drastically threatening to jeopardize the bike urban movement. This paper
studies cycling risk and discomfort using a diverse spectrum of data sources
about geolocated bike accidents and their severity. Empirical continuous
spatial risk estimations are calculated via kernel density contours that map
safety in a case study of Zurich city. The role of weather, time, accident type
and severity are illustrated. Given the predominance of self-caused accidents,
an open-source software artifact for personalized route recommendations is
introduced. The software is also used to collect open baseline route data that
are compared with alternative ones that minimize risk or discomfort. These
contributions can provide invaluable insights for urban planners to improve
infrastructure. They can also improve the risk awareness of existing cyclists'
as well as support new cyclists, such as tourists, to safely explore a new
urban environment by bike.

communication in wireless sensor networks and the Internet of Things (IoT).
However, sometimes due to the necessity of multi-hop relaying in such
communication networks, it is challenging to guarantee the secrecy of
cooperative transmissions when the relays may themselves be eavesdroppers,
i.e., we may face with the untrusted relaying scenario where the relays are
both necessary helpers and potential adversary. To obviate this issue, a new
cooperative jamming scheme is proposed in this paper, in which the data can be
confidentially communicated from the source to the destination through multiple
untrusted relays. In our proposed secure transmission scheme, all the
legitimate nodes contribute to providing secure communication by intelligently
injecting artificial noises to the network in different communication phases.
For the sake of analysis, we consider a multi-hop untrusted relaying network
with two successive intermediate nodes, i.e, a three-hop communications
network. Given this system model, a new closed-form expression is presented in
the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region for the Ergodic secrecy rate (ESR).
Furthermore, we evaluate the high SNR slope and power offset of the ESR to gain
an insightful comparison of the proposed secure transmission scheme and the
state-of-arts. Our numerical results highlight that the proposed secure
transmission scheme provides better secrecy rate performance compared with the
two-hop untrusted relaying as well as the direct transmission schemes.

lower bounds on the singular values with similar qualitative behavior in m (the

stable analytic continuation of possibly nonbandlimited functions whose Fourier
transform belongs to L^2(exp(b|.|)). We also derive bounds on the sup-norm of
