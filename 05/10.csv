named the best-scored random forest density estimation whose effectiveness is
supported by both solid theoretical analysis and significant experimental
performance. The terminology best-scored stands for selecting one density tree
with the best estimation performance out of a certain number of purely random
density tree candidates and we then name the selected one the best-scored
random density tree. In this manner, the ensemble of these selected trees that
is the best-scored random density forest can achieve even better estimation
results than simply integrating trees without selection. From the theoretical
perspective, by decomposing the error term into two, we are able to carry out
the following analysis: First of all, we establish the consistency of the
best-scored random density trees under $L_1$-norm. Secondly, we provide the
convergence rates of them under $L_1$-norm concerning with three different tail
assumptions, respectively. Thirdly, the convergence rates under
$L_{\infty}$-norm is presented. Last but not least, we also achieve the above
convergence rates analysis for the best-scored random density forest. When
conducting comparative experiments with other state-of-the-art density
estimation approaches on both synthetic and real data sets, it turns out that
our algorithm has not only significant advantages in terms of estimation
accuracy over other methods, but also stronger resistance to the curse of
dimensionality.

gravity at early times, due to the decreased curvature-dependent fermion mass.
Through the perturbation level, we obtain the scalar spectral index and the

The efficiency of inflation from fermions with curvature-dependent mass, at

a much larger distance. Methods. We used the capabilities of CRIRES
spectrograph located at ESO Very Large Telescope in Chile to obtain absorption
spectra of individual lines at a high spectral resolution of R=65000, that is,
5 km/s. We observed the 12CO R(0), P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4), P(5), P(6), P(7) and
P(9) transition lines, applied standard data reduction, and compared the
results with literature data. Results. We present the results of CRIRES
observations of 13 infrared sources located in the central parsec of the
Galaxy. The data provide direct evidence for a complex structure of the
interstellar medium along the line of sight and in the close environment of the
central sources. In particular we find four cold foreground clouds at radial
velocities vLS R of the order of -145,-85, -60, and -40+-15 km/s that show
absorption in the lower transition lines from R(0) to P(2) and in all the
observed spectra.We also find in all sources an absorption in velocity range of
50-60 km/s, possibly associated with the so-called 50 km/s cloud and suggesting
an extension of this cloud in front of the GC. Finally, we detect individual
absorption lines that are probably associated with material much closer to the
center and with the sources themselves, suggesting the presence of cold gas in
the local region.

received as much attention as Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). While
BART is now routinely performed for prediction tasks, its theoretical
properties began to be understood only very recently. In this work, we continue
the theoretical investigation of BART initiated by Rockova and van der Pas
(2017). In particular, we study the Bernstein-von Mises (BvM) phenomenon (i.e.
asymptotic normality) for smooth linear functionals of the regression surface
within the framework of non-parametric regression with fixed covariates. As
with other adaptive priors, the BvM phenomenon may fail when the regularities
of the functional and the truth are not compatible. To overcome the curse of
adaptivity under hierarchical priors, we induce a self-similarity assumption to
ensure convergence towards a single Gaussian distribution as opposed to a
Gaussian mixture. Similar qualitative restrictions on the functional parameter
are known to be necessary for adaptive inference. Many machine learning methods
lack coherent probabilistic mechanisms for gauging uncertainty. BART readily
provides such quantification via posterior credible sets. The BvM theorem
implies that the credible sets are also confidence regions with the same
asymptotic coverage. This paper presents the first asymptotic normality result
for BART priors, providing another piece of evidence that BART is a valid tool
from a frequentist point of view.

G29.37+0.1, which is likely formed by the superposition of a background radio
galaxy and a Galactic supernova remnant (SNR). We investigate the possible
connection between the SNR, the PWN G29.4+0.1, and HESS J1844-030 to shed light
on the astrophysical origin of the TeV emission. METHODS: We performed an
imaging and spectral study of the X-ray emission from the PWN G29.4+0.1 using
archival observations obtained with the Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes.
Public radio continuum and HI data were used to derive distance constraints for
the SNR that is linked to G29.37+0.1 and to investigate the interstellar medium
where it is expanding. We applied a simple model of the evolution of a PWN
inside an SNR to analyze the association between G29.4+0.1 and the radio
emission from G29.37+0.1. We compared the spectral properties of the system
with the population of TeV PWNe to investigate if HESS J1844-030 is the very
high energy counterpart of the X-ray PWN G29.4+0.1. RESULTS: We conclude that
G29.4+0.1 is a PWN and that a point source embedded on it is the powering
pulsar. The HI data revealed that the SNR linked to G29.37+0.1 is a Galactic
source at 6.5 kpc and expanding in a nonuniform medium. From the analysis of
the pulsar motion and the pressure balance at the boundary of X-ray emission,
we conclude that G29.4+0.1 could be a PWN that is located inside its host
remnant, forming a new composite SNR. Based on the magnetic field of the PWN
obtained from the X-ray luminosity, we found that the population of electrons
producing synchrotron radiation in the keV band can also produce IC photons in
the TeV band. This suggests that HESS J1844-030 could be the very high energy
counterpart of G29.4+0.1.

recent studies have shown that some can be generated in-situ by the collision
of dense counter propagating flows. In this theoretical study, we analyse the
mechanism that triggers the propagation of kink and sausage modes in the solar
corona, following the collision of counter-propagating flows and how the
properties of the flows affect the properties of the generated waves. In order
to study in detail such a mechanism we run a series of ideal 2D and 3D MHD
simulations where we vary the properties of the counter-propagating flows and
by means of a simple technique to estimate the amplitudes of the kink and
sausage modes, we investigate their role on the generation and propagation of
the MHD waves. We find that the amplitude of the waves is largely dependent on
the kinetic energy of the flows and that the onset of kink or sausage modes
depends on the asymmetries between the colliding blobs. Moreover, the initial
wavelength of the MHD waves is associated with the magnetic configuration
resulting from the collision of the flows. We also find that genuine 3D systems
respond with smaller wave amplitudes. In this study, we present a parameter
space description of the mechanism that leads to the generation of MHD waves

and items as binary vectors for Collaborative Filtering (CF) can achieve fast
user-item affinity computation in the Hamming space, in recent years, we have
witnessed an emerging research effort in exploiting binary hashing techniques

accuracy due to limited representation capability in each bit, which impedes it
from modeling complex structure of the data.
  In this work, we attempt to improve the efficiency without hurting the model
performance by utilizing both the accuracy of real-valued vectors and the
efficiency of binary codes to represent users/items. In particular, we propose
the Compositional Coding for Collaborative Filtering (CCCF) framework, which
not only gains better recommendation efficiency than the state-of-the-art
binarized CF approaches but also achieves even higher accuracy than the
real-valued CF method. Specifically, CCCF innovatively represents each
user/item with a set of binary vectors, which are associated with a sparse
real-value weight vector. Each value of the weight vector encodes the
importance of the corresponding binary vector to the user/item. The continuous
weight vectors greatly enhances the representation capability of binary codes,
and its sparsity guarantees the processing speed. Furthermore, an integer
weight approximation scheme is proposed to further accelerate the speed. Based
on the CCCF framework, we design an efficient discrete optimization algorithm
to learn its parameters. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art binarized CF methods

electrons at energies of $\sim$ $27$ keV to $310$ keV. Previous velocity
dispersion analyses employ the onset times, which are often affected by
instrumental effects and the pre-existing background flux, leading to large
uncertainties. We propose a new method here. Instead of using the peak or onset
time, we apply the velocity dispersion analysis to the times that correspond to
the rising phase of the fluxes that are a fraction, $\eta$, of the peak flux.
We perform statistical analysis on selected events whose calculated path
lengths have uncertainties smaller than $0.1$ AU. The mean and standard
deviation, ($\mu$, $\sigma$), of the calculated path lengths corresponding to
$\eta=$ $3/4$, $1/2$, and $1/3$ of the peak flux is ($1.17$ AU, $0.17$ AU),
($1.11$ AU, $0.14$ AU), and ($1.06$ AU, $0.15$ AU). The distribution of the
calculated path lengths is also well fitted by a Gaussian distribution for the
$\eta=3/4$ and $1/3$ cases. These results suggest that in these electron events
the interplanetary magnetic field topology is close to the nominal Parker
spiral with little field line meandering. Our results have important

edges, signature of the frozen propagation of switching fronts. This type of
gap solitons belongs to the class of truncated Bloch waves, and had only been
observed in closed systems up to now. Here the driven-dissipative character of
the system gives rise to a complex multistability of the nonlinear domains
generated in the flat band. These results open up interesting perspective
regarding more complex 2D lattices and the generation of correlated photon
phases.

with that of MCMC in an important complex model used in Nuclear Magnetic

employed in this setting due to the hard constraints involved in the model.

channels at another set of antennas---possibly at a different location and a
different frequency band? If this channel-to-channel mapping is possible, we
can expect dramatic gains for massive MIMO systems. For example, in FDD massive
MIMO, the uplink channels can be mapped to the downlink channels or the
downlink channels at one subset of antennas can be mapped to the downlink
channels at all the other antennas. This can significantly reduce (or even
eliminate) the downlink training/feedback overhead. In the context of
cell-free/distributed massive MIMO systems, this channel mapping can be
leveraged to reduce the fronthaul signaling overhead as only the channels at a
subset of the distributed terminals need to be fed to the central unit which
can map them to the channels at all the other terminals. This mapping can also
find interesting applications in mmWave beam prediction, MIMO radar, and
massive MIMO based positioning.
  In this paper, we introduce the new concept of channel mapping in space and
frequency, where the channels at one set of antennas and one frequency band are
mapped to the channels at another set of antennas and frequency band. First, we
prove that this channel-to-channel mapping function exists under the condition
that the mapping from the candidate user positions to the channels at the first
set of antennas is bijective; a condition that can be achieved with high
probability in several practical MIMO communication scenarios. Then, we note
that the channel-to-channel mapping function, even if it exists, is typically
unknown and very hard to characterize analytically as it heavily depends on the
various elements of the surrounding environment. With this motivation, we
propose to leverage the powerful learning capabilities of deep neural networks

atmospheric and instrumental conditions. The ARPS procedure is applied to
selected light curves with strong planetary signals from the Kepler mission
that have been altered to simulate the conditions of ground-based exoplanet
surveys. Typical irregular cadence patterns are used from the HATSouth survey.
We also evaluate recovery of known planets from HATSouth. Simulations test
transit signal recovery as a function of cadence pattern and duration, stellar
magnitude, planet orbital period and transit depth. Detection rates improve for
shorter periods and deeper transits. The study predicts that the ARPS
methodology will detect planets with $\gtrsim 0.1$\% transit depth and periods
$\lesssim 40$ days in HATSouth stars brighter than $\sim$15 mag. ARPS
methodology is therefore promising for planet discovery from ground-based

$b$-jets and opposite-sign di-lepton ($5b2\ell$), same-sign di-lepton

self-coupling and $tthh$ contact interaction; (3) heavy Higgs ($H$) production
with $tt H \to tthh$; and (4) pair production of fermionic top partners ($T$)
with $T T \to tthh$. To address the complication of event topologies and the
mess of combinatorial backgrounds, a tool of Boosted-Decision-Tree was applied
in the analyses. The $5b1\ell$ and SS2$\ell$ analyses define the two most
promising channels, resulting in slightly different sensitivities. For
non-resonant $tthh$ production, a combination of these exclusive analyses
allows for its measurment in the SM with a statistical significance $\sim

where the $n$ bidders' values are independently and identically drawn from a
regular distribution, the Vickrey auction with one additional bidder (a
duplicate) extracts at least as much revenue as the optimal auction without the
duplicate. Hartline and Roughgarden, in their influential 2009 paper, removed
the requirement that the distributions be identical, at the cost of allowing
the Vickrey auction to recruit $n$ duplicates, one from each distribution, and
relaxing its revenue advantage to a $2$-approximation.
  In this work we restore Bulow and Klemperer's number of duplicates in
Hartline and Roughgarden's more general setting with a worse approximation
ratio. We show that recruiting a duplicate from one of the distributions
suffices for the Vickrey auction to $10$-approximate the optimal revenue. We
also show that in a $k$-items unit demand auction, recruiting $k$ duplicates
suffices for the VCG auction to $O(1)$-approximate the optimal revenue.
  As another result, we tighten the analysis for Hartline and Roughgarden's
Vickrey auction with $n$ duplicates for the case with two bidders in the
auction. We show that in this case the Vickrey auction with two duplicates
obtains at least $3/4$ of the optimal revenue. This is tight by meeting a lower
bound by Hartline and Roughgarden. En route, we obtain a transparent analysis
of their $2$-approximation for $n$~bidders, via a natural connection to Ronen's
lookahead auction.

give analogous results in cases when the postsingular set is unbounded. More
specifically, we show that if $f$ is of finite order, has bounded criticality

systematic approach to constructing approximate multivariate likelihoods with
one-dimensional parametric functions by assuming independence or more flexible
non-parametric multivariate methods after decorrelating the data points using
principal component analysis (PCA). While the use of PCA does not modify the
non-Gaussianity of the multivariate likelihood, we find empirically that the
one-dimensional marginal sampling distributions of the PCA components exhibit
less skewness and kurtosis than the original shear correlation

the assumption of independence between PCA components thus gives a lower limit
for the biases. We further demonstrate that the difference in cosmological

more complex non-Gaussian likelihood models would be even smaller for an

For $\beta$ Sco, we find that the derived column density of the J$^{\prime

explode slightly more vigorously with increasing resolution. This suggests that
there can be a qualitative dependence of the outcome of 3D CCSN simulations
upon spatial resolution. The critical aspect of higher spatial resolution is
the adequate capturing of the physics of neutrino-driven turbulence, in
particular its Reynolds stress. The greater numerical viscosity of
lower-resolution simulations results in greater drag on the turbulent eddies
that embody turbulent stress, and, hence, in a diminution of their vigor.
Turbulent stress not only pushes the temporarily stalled shock further out, but
bootstraps a concomitant increase in the deposited neutrino power. Both effects
together lie at the core of the resolution dependence we observe.

one, pion/eta particles in the final state. We use the multipole expansion but
not the twist expansion. The latter cannot be justified for the energy release
of hadronic transitions between heavy quarkonium states with different
principal quantum numbers. Instead, we use a counting based on the dimension of
the interpolating field of the hybrid. This alternative counting allows us to
still use chiral low-energy theorems to compute the pion production by local
gluonic operators. We explore the phenomenological impact of this counting.
Remarkably enough, for the two-pion transitions, we obtain the same predictions
for the normalized differential decay rate as those obtained assuming the twist
expansion. We implement this computational scheme using the hadronic
representation of the effective theory potential NRQCD. We assume that the
inverse Bohr radius of the heavy quarkonium is much larger than $\Lambda_{\rm
QCD}$ but do not impose any constraint on the relative size of $\Lambda_{\rm
QCD}$ and the typical kinetic energy of the bound state.

domain surveys. When crossing the line of sight to point-like sources, strings
produce a distinctive microlensing signature. We consider two avenues to hunt
for a relic population of superstring loops: frequent monitoring of (1) stars
in Andromeda, lensed by loops in the haloes of the Milky-Way and Andromeda and
(2) supernovae at cosmological distances, lensed by loops in the intergalactic
medium. We assess the potential of such experiments to detect and/or constrain
strings with a range of tensions, $10^{-15} \lesssim G \mu/c^2 \lesssim
10^{-6}$. The practical sensitivity is tied to cadence of observations which we
explore in detail. We forecast that high-cadence monitoring of $\sim 10^5$
stars on the far side of Andromeda over a year-long period will detect
microlensing events if $G\mu/c^2 \sim 10^{-13}$, while $\sim 10^6$ stars will
detect events if $10^{-13.5} <G\mu/c^2 < 10^{-11.5}$; the upper and lower
bounds of the accessible tension range continue to expand as the number of
stars rises. We also analyse the ability to reject models in the absence of
fluctuations. While challenging, these studies are within reach of forthcoming
time-domain surveys. Supernova observations can hypothetically constrain models
with $10^{-12} < G\mu/c^2 < 10^{-6}$ without any optimisation of the survey
cadence. However, the event rate forecast suggests it will be difficult to
reject models of interest. As a demonstration, we use observations from the
Pantheon Type Ia supernova cosmology data-set to place modest constraints on
the number density of cosmic superstrings in a poorly tested region of the

$k_\mathrm{2,obs}=0.616\pm 0.067$, strongly indicating a global subsurface
ocean. However, the theoretical Love number due to equilibrium tides is at most
$k_\mathrm{2,eq}^\mathrm{max}\approx 0.48$ in the absence of an ice shell on
top of the ocean. In reality, there is an outer ice shell of thickness $
100\,\mathrm{km}$, reducing the equilibrium-tide Love number to
$k_\mathrm{2,eq}\approx 0.42$. Therefore, other types of tidal response, like
dynamic tides, may be also present in Titan. We propose that the ocean is
stably stratified. As a result, there exist standing ocean waves (gravity
modes) with eigen-frequencies close to the tidal frequency. Such a gravity mode
(g-mode) is resonantly excited. It bends the outer ice shell radially and thus
enhances the dynamic Love number by $k_\mathrm{2,g}$. In order for
$k_\mathrm{2,g}$ to account for the discrepancy between $k_\mathrm{2,eq}$ and
$k_\mathrm{2,obs}$, the Brunt-Vaisala frequency in the ocean is required to be
$3.3\times 10^{-4}\,\mathrm{rad\, s^{-1}}$. It is compatible with the
volatile-rich model for Titan that was proposed to explain the methane-rich
atmosphere. The three components of the tidal potential with azimuthal degrees,
$m=-2,0,2$, correspond to the three components of the quadrupole Love number,
$k_\mathrm{2,-2}$, $k_\mathrm{2,0}$ and $k_\mathrm{2,2}$. They can excite
retrograde, axisymmetric and prograde g-modes equally in the absence of
rotation. However, Coriolis force induced by Titan's rotation breaks the
symmetry among these modes. Most likely, only one of the Love-number components
is significantly enhanced by a g-mode, while the other two are still attributed
to equilibrium tides. This prediction is testable by observation. If confirmed,
the smaller components of the Love number can be used to constrain the
thickness of the outer ice shell.

applications such as demand forecasting and financial predictions. Modern
datasets can have millions of correlated time-series that evolve together, i.e
they are extremely high dimensional (one dimension for each individual
time-series). There is a need for exploiting global patterns and coupling them
with local calibration for better prediction. However, most recent deep
learning approaches in the literature are one-dimensional, i.e, even though
they are trained on the whole dataset, during prediction, the future forecast
for a single dimension mainly depends on past values from the same dimension.
In this paper, we seek to correct this deficiency and propose DeepGLO, a deep
forecasting model which thinks globally and acts locally. In particular,
DeepGLO is a hybrid model that combines a global matrix factorization model
regularized by a temporal convolution network, along with another temporal
network that can capture local properties of each time-series and associated
covariates. Our model can be trained effectively on high-dimensional but
diverse time series, where different time series can have vastly different
scales, without a priori normalization or rescaling. Empirical results
demonstrate that DeepGLO can outperform state-of-the-art approaches; for
example, we see more than 25% improvement in WAPE over other methods on a

previous estimation can be used as prior knowledge. Unlike the ML cases, the
corresponding Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Lower bound (BCRLB) shows clear relation
with parameters and a low complexity algorithm achieves the BCRLB in almost all

arbitrary correlation and mean. The estimation is based on pilot/training
signals. An unexpected result is that the joint MAP estimation is equivalent to
an individual MAP estimation of the frequency offset first, again different
from the ML results. We provide insight on the pilot/training signal design

complexity for the accommodation of time varying channels, the MAP solution
provides a different route for dealing with time variation. Within a short

acoustic phonons in materials are stimulated by laser light and scatter the

Exploitation of SBS has recently surged on integrated photonics platforms as
simultaneous confinement of photons and phonons in waveguides leads to
drastically enhanced interaction. Instead of being optically stimulated,
coherent phonons can also be electromechanically excited with very high
efficiency as has been exploited in radiofrequency acoustic filters. Here, we
demonstrate electromechanically excited Brillouin scattering in integrated
optomechanical waveguides made of piezoelectric material aluminum nitride

electromechanical transducers to scatter counter-propagating photons in the
waveguide into a single anti-Stokes sideband. We show that phase-matching
conditions of Brillouin scattering can be tuned by varying both the optical
wavelength and the acoustic frequency to realize tunable single-sideband
modulation. Combining Brillouin scattering photonics with nanoelectromechanical

of $\mathit{embedding}$ code and natural language queries, into real vectors

including $\mathit{unsupervised}$ techniques, which rely only on a corpus of
code examples, and $\mathit{supervised}$ techniques, which use an
$\mathit{aligned}$ corpus of paired code and natural language descriptions. The
goal of this supervision is to produce embeddings that are more similar for a
query and the corresponding desired code snippet. Clearly, there are choices in
whether to use supervised techniques at all, and if one does, what sort of
network and training to use for supervision. This paper is the first to
evaluate these choices systematically. To this end, we assembled
implementations of state-of-the-art techniques to run on a common platform,
training and evaluation corpora. To explore the design space in network
complexity, we also introduced a new design point that is a $\mathit{minimal}$
supervision extension to an existing unsupervised technique. Our evaluation
shows that: 1. adding supervision to an existing unsupervised technique can
improve performance, though not necessarily by much; 2. simple networks for
supervision can be more effective that more sophisticated sequence-based
networks for code search; 3. while it is common to use docstrings to carry out
supervision, there is a sizeable gap between the effectiveness of docstrings

e.g., deep neural networks, benefit enormously from the advances in distributed
non-convex optimization techniques, e.g., distributed Stochastic Gradient
Descent (SGD). A series of recent works study the linear speedup property of
distributed SGD variants with reduced communication. The linear speedup
property enable us to scale out the computing capability by adding more
computing nodes into our system. The reduced communication complexity is
desirable since communication overhead is often the performance bottleneck in
distributed systems. Recently, momentum methods are more and more widely
adopted in training machine learning models and can often converge faster and
generalize better. For example, many practitioners use distributed SGD with
momentum to train deep neural networks with big data. However, it remains
unclear whether any distributed momentum SGD possesses the same linear speedup
property as distributed SGD and has reduced communication complexity. This
paper fills the gap by considering a distributed communication efficient
momentum SGD method and proving its linear speedup property.

occurs, also known as survival modeling. We observe through substantial
experiments on large real-world datasets and use-cases that populations are
largely heterogeneous. Sub-populations have different mean and variance in
their survival rates requiring flexible models that capture heterogeneity. We
leverage a classical extension of the logistic function into the survival
setting to characterize unobserved heterogeneity using the beta distribution.
This yields insights into the geometry of the problem as well as efficient
estimation methods for linear, tree and neural network models that adjust the
beta distribution based on observed covariates. We also show that the
additional information captured by the beta distribution leads to interesting
ranking implications as we determine who is most-at-risk. We show theoretically
that the ranking is variable as we forecast forward in time and prove that
pairwise comparisons of survival remain transitive. Empirical results using
large-scale datasets across two use-cases (online conversions and retention
modeling), demonstrate the competitiveness of the method. The simplicity of the
method and its ability to capture skew in the data makes it a viable
alternative to standard techniques particularly when we are interested in the

aftershock distribution is clear and well beyond the influence of typical
earthquake location uncertainty. The sequence included rupture of multiple
fault segments, spatially separated. We use surface-wave based relative
centroid locations to examine whether, at the small scale, the distribution of
the aftershocks was influenced by location errors. Surface-wave based relative
location has delineated precise oceanic transform fault earthquake locations in
multiple regions. However, the relocated aftershocks off the coast of Sumatra
seldom align along simple linear trends that are compatible with the
corresponding fault strikes as estimated for the GCMT catalog. The relocation
of roughly 60 moderate-earthquake epicentroids suggests that the faulting
involved in the 2012 earthquake aftershock sequence included strain release
along many short fault segments. Statistical analysis and temporal variations
of aftershocks show a typical decay of the aftershocks but a relatively low
number of aftershocks, as is common for intraplate oceanic earthquakes. Coulomb
stress calculations indicate that most of the moderate-magnitude aftershocks
are compatible with stress changes predicted by the large-event slip models.
The patterns in the aftershocks suggest that the formation of the boundary and
eventual localization of deformation between the Indian and Australian plate is
a complicated process.

only on the structure of the game. In both games the optimal payoffs can be

The payoff with Richman bidding equals the payoff of a random-turn based game

information about the distribution of a collection of items, drawn from a
totally ordered universe. We study data structures, called quantile summaries,
which keep track of all quantiles, up to an error of at most $\varepsilon$.
That is, an $\varepsilon$-approximate quantile summary first processes a stream
of items and then, given any quantile query $0\le \phi\le 1$, returns an item
from the stream, which is a $\phi'$-quantile for some $\phi' = \phi \pm
\varepsilon$. We focus on comparison-based quantile summaries that can only
compare two items and are otherwise completely oblivious of the universe.
  The best such deterministic quantile summary to date, due to Greenwald and
Khanna (SIGMOD '01), stores at most $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\cdot \log
\varepsilon N)$ items, where $N$ is the number of items in the stream. We prove
that this space bound is optimal by showing a matching lower bound. Our result
thus rules out the possibility of constructing a deterministic comparison-based
quantile summary in space $f(\varepsilon)\cdot o(\log N)$, for any function $f$
that does not depend on $N$. As a corollary, we improve the lower bound for
biased quantiles, which provide a stronger, relative-error guarantee of $(1\pm
\varepsilon)\cdot \phi$, and for other related computational tasks.

hope that they could be used to prove cases of Fujita's conjecture. While
examples of Miranda seemed to indicate that Seshadri constants could not be
used to prove Fujita's conjecture, we present a new approach to Fujita's
conjecture using Seshadri constants and positive characteristic methods. Our
technique recovers some known results toward Fujita's conjecture over the
complex numbers, without the use of vanishing theorems, and proves new results
for complex varieties with singularities. Instead of vanishing theorems, we use
positive characteristic techniques related to the Frobenius-Seshadri constants

mathematically rigorous and precise framework for non-equilibrium
thermodynamics, explicitly defined in terms of a set of observables.
Observational entropy can be seen as a generalization of Boltzmann entropy to
systems with indeterminate initial conditions, and describes the knowledge
achievable about the system by a macroscopic observer with limited measurement
capabilities; it becomes Gibbs entropy in the limit of perfectly fine-grained
measurements. This quantity, while previously mentioned in the literature, has
been investigated in detail only in the quantum case. We describe this
framework reasonably pedagogically, then show that in this framework, certain
choices of coarse-graining lead to an entropy that is well-defined out of
equilibrium, additive on independent systems, and that grows towards
thermodynamic entropy as the system reaches equilibrium, even for systems that
are genuinely isolated. Choosing certain macroscopic regions, this dynamical
thermodynamic entropy measures how close these regions are to thermal
equilibrium. We also show that in the given formalism, the correspondence
between classical entropy (defined on classical phase space) and quantum
entropy (defined on Hilbert space) becomes surprisingly direct and transparent,
while manifesting differences stemming from non-commutativity of
coarse-grainings and from non-existence of a direct classical analogue of
quantum energy eigenstates.

allowing for computing projections of the multi-marginal transport plan using
only matrix-vector operations of relatively small matrices. As illustrating
examples, we apply the resulting method to tracking and barycenter problems in
spatial spectral estimation. In particular, we show that the optimal mass
transport framework allows for fusing information from different time steps, as
well as from different sensor arrays, also when the sensor arrays are not

most interesting range of densities is $0\le \rho < 1/2$. We define the system
{\em typical flux} as the limit in $n\to\infty$ of the steady-state flux in a

modifications to the $Z$-boson interactions. These changes can be minimized by
exclusively charging right-handed fermions under the new Abelian symmetry, and
are compensated by the neutral $X$-boson exchange. Non-universality of fermion

this process causes significant variation in the abundance of water vapor at
the surface. While previous studies of regolith-atmosphere exchange focus on
the abundance, recent in-situ experiments and remote sensing observations
measure the isotopic composition of the atmospheric water. We are therefore
motivated to investigate isotopic water exchange between the atmosphere and the
regolith and determine its effect on the deuterium to hydrogen ratio (D/H) of
the atmosphere. We model transport of water in the regolith and
regolith-atmosphere exchange by solving a transport equation including regolith
adsorption, condensation, and diffusion. The model calculates equilibrium
fractionation between HDO and H2O in each of these processes. The fractionation
in adsorption is caused by the difference in the latent heat of adsorption, and
that of condensation is caused by the difference in the vapor pressure.
Together with a simple, bulk-aerodynamic boundary layer model, we simulate the
diurnal variation of the D/H near the planetary surface. We find that the D/H
can vary by 300 - 1400 per mil diurnally in the equatorial and mid-latitude
locations, and the magnitude is greater at a colder location or season. The
variability is mainly driven by adsorption and desorption of regolith
particles, and its diurnal trend features a drop in the early morning, a rise
to the peak value during the daytime, and a second drop in the late afternoon
and evening, tracing the water vapor flow into and out from the regolith. The
predicted D/H variation can be tested with in-situ measurements. As such, our
calculations suggest stable isotope analysis to be a powerful tool in
pinpointing regolith-atmosphere exchange of water on Mars.

the self-gravity of growing atmospheres that causes accretion rates to rise

controlled by circumstellar disc gaps (cavities) opened by planetary
gravitational torques. We develop a fully time-dependent theory of gap
formation and couple it self-consistently to planetary growth rates. When gaps
first open, planetary torques overwhelm viscous torques, and gas depletes as if
it were inviscid. In low-viscosity discs, of the kind motivated by recent
observations and theory, gaps stay predominantly in this inviscid phase and
planet masses finalize at $M_{\rm final}/M_\star\sim(\Omega t_{\rm

stellar mass, $\Omega$ the planet's orbital angular velocity, $t_{\rm disc}$
the gas disc's lifetime, $H/a$ its aspect ratio, and $\rho_0$ its unperturbed
density. This final mass is independent of the dimensionless viscosity $\alpha$

disc scale heights exceed planet radii. It evaluates to a few Jupiter masses at

data structures. Charlotte data is stored in blocks that reference each other
by hash. Together, all Charlotte blocks form a directed acyclic graph, the
blockweb; all observers and applications use subgraphs of the blockweb for
their own data structures. Unlike prior systems, Charlotte data structures are
composable: applications and data structures can operate fully independently
when possible, and share blocks when desired. To support this composability, we
define a language-independent format for Charlotte blocks and a network API for
Charlotte servers.
  An authenticated distributed data structure guarantees that data is immutable
and self-authenticating: data referenced will be unchanged when it is
retrieved. Charlotte extends these guarantees by allowing applications to plug
in their own mechanisms for ensuring availability and integrity of data
structures. Unlike most traditional distributed systems, including distributed
databases, blockchains, and distributed hash tables, Charlotte supports
heterogeneous trust: different observers may have their own beliefs about who
might fail, and how. Despite heterogeneity of trust, Charlotte presents each
observer with a consistent, available view of data.
  We demonstrate the flexibility of Charlotte by implementing a variety of
integrity mechanisms, including consensus and proof of work. We study the power
of disentangling availability and integrity mechanisms by building a variety of
applications. The results from these examples suggest that developers can use
Charlotte to build flexible, fast, composable applications with strong

metropolitan areas around the world congestion and inefficient traffic

urban road networks and freeways. Unfortunately, the instrumentation for
accurate traffic measurement is expensive and not widely implemented. This
thesis addresses this problem, where relatively inexpensive and easy to install
loop-detectors are used by a geometric deep learning algorithm, which uses
loop-detector data in a spatial context of a road network, to estimate queue
length in front of signalized intersections, which can be then used for
following traffic control tasks. Therefore, in the first part of this work a
conventional estimation method for queue length (which does not use machine
learning techniques) based on second-by-second loop-detector data is
implemented, which uses detected shockwaves in queues to estimate the length
and point of time for the maximum queue. The method is later used as reference
but also as additional input information for the geometric deep learning
approach. In the second part the geometric deep learning algorithm is
developed, which uses spatial correlations in the road network but also
temporal correlations in detector data time sequences by new attention
mechanisms, to overcome the limitations of conventional methods like excess
traffic demand, lane changing and stop-and-go traffic. Therefore, it is
necessary to abstract the topology of the road network in a graph. Both
approaches are compared regarding their performance, reliability as well as
limitations and validated by usage of the traffic simulation software SUMO

understood and explored, both mathematically and algorithmically. That said,
practical realization of this theorem still suffers from a severe bottleneck
due to the fundamental assumption that the samples can span an arbitrary range
of amplitudes. In practice, the theorem is realized using so-called
analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) which clip or saturate whenever the signal
amplitude exceeds the maximum recordable ADC voltage thus leading to a
significant information loss. In this paper, we develop an alternative paradigm
for sensing and recovery, called the Unlimited Sampling Framework. It is based
on the observation that when a signal is mapped to an appropriate bounded
interval via a modulo operation before entering the ADC, the saturation problem
no longer exists, but one rather encounters a different type of information
loss due to the modulo operation. Such an alternative setup can be implemented,
for example, via so-called folding or self-reset ADCs, as they have been
proposed in various contexts in the circuit design literature. The key task
that we need to accomplish in order to cope with this new type of information
loss is to recover a bandlimited signal from its modulo samples. In this paper
we derive conditions when perfect recovery is possible and complement them with
a stable recovery algorithm. The sampling density required to guarantee
recovery is independent of the maximum recordable ADC voltage and depends on
the signal bandwidth only. Our recovery guarantees extend to measurements
affected by bounded noise, which includes the case of round-off quantization.
Numerical experiments validate our approach. Applications of the unlimited
sampling paradigm can be found in a number of fields such as signal processing,
communication and imaging.

logarithmic transformation. Then, the global contrast enhanced face image is
convolved with difference of Gaussian filters and difference of bilateral
filters, and the filtered images are weighted and merged using a coefficient
selection rule based on the standard deviation (SD) of image, which can enhance
image texture information while filtering out most noise. Finally, the local
contrast equalization (LCE) is performed on the fused face image to reduce the
influence caused by over or under saturated pixel values in highlight or dark
regions. Experimental results on the Extended Yale B face database and CMU PIE
face database demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust to
illumination changes and achieve higher recognition accuracy when compared with
other illumination normalization methods and a deep CNNs based illumination
invariant face recognition method

surface geometry to avoid unintended contact with the environment. Model-based
3D object manipulation is a widely studied problem; however, obtaining the
accurate 3D object models for multiple objects often requires tedious work. In
this letter, we exploit Gaussian process implicit surfaces (GPIS) extracted

the manipulation task.
  We use a sampling-based trajectory generation method to explore the unseen

We validate our method with physical robot experiments across eleven different
objects of varying shape from the YCB object dataset. Our experiments show that
our reconstruction-aware trajectory optimization provides higher-quality 3D

multi-scale information allows these methods to achieve the state-of-the-art

iterative algorithm that performs estimation by updating an estimate of the
unknown signal at each iteration and the performance of AMP (quantified, for
example, by the mean squared error of its estimates) depends on the choice of a
""denoiser"" function that is used to produce these signal estimates at each

  An attractive feature of AMP is that its performance can be tracked by a

of the accuracy of the state evolution predictions has been limited to the use
of only separable denoisers or block-separable denoisers, a class of denoisers

Since signals with entrywise dependencies are common in image/video-processing

usual combinatorial distances of the nodes. Inspired by this result, we perform
a similar analysis for CTQWs both in closed and open systems, including
time-dependent couplings. For time-reversal symmetric coherent quantum
evolutions, the short time asymptotics of the transition probabilities is
completely determined by the topology of the underlying graph analogously to
the classical case, but with a doubled power-law exponent. Moreover, this
result is robust against the introduction of on-site potential terms. However,

background is not a spherical shell. Apart from its finite width, each photon
experiences a different gravitational potential along its journey to us,
leading to different travel times in different directions. Since all photons
were released at the same cosmic time, the photons with longer travel times
started farther away from us than those with shorter times. Thus, the surface
of last scattering is corrugated, a deformed spherical shell. We present an
estimator quadratic in the temperature and polarization fields that could
provide a map of the time delays as a function of position on the sky. The
signal to noise of this map could exceed unity for the dipole, thereby
providing a rare insight into the universe on the largest observable scales.

network is likely to be disrupted due to environmental conditions or where the
network topology makes it impossible to find a direct route from the sender to
the receiver. Underwater networks typically use acoustic waves for transmitting
data. However, these waves are susceptible to interference from sources of
noise such as the wake from ships, sounds from snapping shrimp, and collisions
from acoustic waves generated by other nodes.
  DTNs are good candidates for situations where successfully delivering the
message is more important than low delivery times and high network throughput.
This is true for certain applications of underwater networks. DTNs can also
create new options for network topologies, such as opening up the possibility
of using data muling nodes if the network is resilient to delays.
  The Acoustic Research Laboratory (ARL) at NUS has developed their own
Groovy-based underwater network simulator called UnetStack, in which network
protocols can be designed and tested in a simulator. These protocols can later
be directly deployed on physical hardware, such as Subnero's underwater modems.
Hence, this project revolves around creating a new UnetStack protocol called
DtnLink for enabling disruption tolerant networking in various use cases of the
ARL.

of the future gravitational wave detectors. One way to detect strong gravity is
through the polarization of gravitational waves. For quasi-normal modes of
black-holes in General Relativity, the two polarisation states of gravitational
waves have the same amplitude and frequency spectrum. Using the principle of
energy conservation, we show that, the polarisations differ for modified
gravity theories. We obtain a diagnostic parameter for polarization mismatch
that provides a unique way to distinguish General Relativity and modified
gravity theories in gravitational wave detectors.

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) into Wide-Area Networks (WANs). For
performance reasons, a Software-Defined WAN is divided into multiple domains
controlled by multiple controllers with a logically centralized view. Under
controller failures, we need to remap the control of offline switches from
failed controllers to other active controllers. Existing solutions could either
overload active controllers to interrupt their normal operations or degrade
network performance because of increasing the controller-switch communication
overhead. In this paper, we propose RetroFlow to achieve low communication
overhead without interrupting the normal processing of active controllers
during controller failures. By intelligently configuring a set of selected
offline switches working under the legacy routing mode, RetroFlow relieves the
active controllers from controlling the selected offline switches while
maintaining the flow programmability (e.g., the ability to change paths of
flows) of SDN. RetroFlow also smartly transfers the control of offline switches
with the SDN routing mode to active controllers to minimize the communication
overhead from these offline switches to the active controllers. Simulation
results show that compared with the baseline algorithm, RetroFlow can reduce
the communication overhead up to 52.6% during a moderate controller failure by
recovering 100% flows from offline switches and can reduce the communication
overhead up to 61.2% during a serious controller failure by setting to recover
90% of flows from offline switches.

border. We use the proposed algorithm to estimate the weights, which represent
cost of transition, and to quantify uncertainty in these weights.

space-times, which stably violate the strong cosmic censor conjecture (in its
usual broad formulation) in four dimensions, is exhibited. Namely, by
elementary Morse theory we demonstrate that these geometries describe
transitions between topologically different spacelike hypersurfaces. More
precisely, in these four dimensional smooth vacuum space-times there exist
three dimensional spacelike hypersurfaces which display an increasingly violent
unbounded oscillation between topologically different closed, orientable
three-manifolds as one moves towards the asymptotic region in their ambient
space-times. Moreover this spatial oscillation appears as a cosmological
redshift for late time observers. Therefore these new vacuum solutions shed
some light onto the deep dynamic regime of general relativity and the structure
of the four dimensional continuum itself.
  This picture, beyond offering a physical clarification how global
hyperbolicity breaks down in these solutions, is also consistent with the fact
that the Riemannian counterparts of these Lorentzian vacuum geometries are not
only Ricci-flat but even self-dual four-manifolds hence give rise to
gravitational instantons. Consequently the role of these Riemannian solutions
is similar to that of Yang--Mills instantons in semi-classical non-Abelian
gauge theories over Minkowski space-time.

interference between the electric- and (usually weak) magnetic-dipole

only involves electric-dipole transitions and does not require the enantio-pure

the determinations of enantiomeric excess for chiral molecules whose
enantio-pure samples are still challenging to achieve.

TSO, PSO, and POWER. Central to such DPOR techniques is the notion of
trace-equivalence, which is computed based on the independence relation among

observationally equivalent if every read event reads the same value in both the

capturing the C/C++ concurrency semantics. We implement the presented technique

Pd3CuNi@PdIr catalyst surface is the most charge depleted. The d-band model
displays an intermediate d-band center downshift for the surface Pd atoms, and
the highest downshift for the surface Ir atoms. Due to synergism between charge

question, we analyze the following model: each period a decision maker faces
the choice whether to complete the task today or to postpone it to later. Cost
and benefits of task completion cannot be directly observed by the analyst, but
the analyst knows that net benefits are drawn independently between periods
from a time-invariant distribution and that the agent has time-separable
utility. Furthermore, we suppose the analyst can observe the agent's exact
stopping probability. We establish that for any agent with quasi-hyperbolic
$\beta,\delta$-preferences and given level of partial naivete $\hat{\beta}$,
the probability of completing the task conditional on not having done it
earlier increases towards the deadline. And conversely, for any given
preference parameters $\beta,\delta$ and (weakly increasing) profile of task
completion probability, there exists a stationary payoff distribution that
rationalizes her behavior as long as the agent is either sophisticated or fully
naive. An immediate corollary being that, without parametric assumptions, it is
impossible to rule out time-consistency even when imposing an a priori
assumption on the permissible long-run discount factor. We also provide an

encapsulated by hydrogenated graphene which could be a promising candidate for
a variety of device applications. We have carried out DFT calculations on this
system to check its feasibility to be a versatile material. We found that
electronic states of multilayer pristine graphene, especially Dirac cone, an
important feature to host QSHE, can be preserved by sandwiching it by fully
hydrogenated graphene. Interference of electronic states of hydrogenated
graphene was insignificant with those of graphene. States of graphene were also
found to be stable upon application of electric field up to 2.5V/nm. For device
applications, multilayer graphene or its heterostructures are required to be
deposited on a substrate, which interacts with system opening up a gap at Dirac
cone making it less suitable for QSHE applications and hydrogenated graphene
can prevent it. Magnetization in these hydrogenated graphene sandwiched
graphene may be induced by creating vacancies or distortions in hydrogenated
graphene, which was found to have minimal effect on graphenes electronic
states, thus providing an additional degree of manipulation. We also performed
a set of calculations to explore its applicability for detecting some
molecules. Our results on trilayer graphene encapsulated by hydrogenated
graphene indicate that all these observations can be generalized to systems
with a larger number of graphene layers, indicating that multilayer graphene
sandwiched between two hydrogenated graphene is a versatile material that can
be used in QSHE, sensor devices, etc.

collective excitations called ""emergent phonons"", which describe dynamics of
SkX caused by lattice vibration (resembling acoustical branches of ordinary

multiple types of ""emergent elastic waves"" (modes causing lattice vibration of

type of topologically protected spin textures. Compared with ordinary crystals,
they can be drastically deformed under anisotropic effects because they are
composed of field patterns whose deformation does not cause any bond-breaking.
This exotic ductility of SkX bring about great tunability of its collective
excitations called emergent phonons, which are vital for magnonics application.
The question is how to quantitatively determine the emergent phonons of
distorted SkX. Here we systematically study the long wavelength emergent
phonons of SkX distorted by (a) a negative exchange anisotropy, and (b) a
tilted magnetic field. In both cases, deformation and structural transitions of
SkX thoroughly influence the frequency, anisotropy of vibrational pattern and
dispersion relation, and coupling between lattice vibration and in-lattice
vibration for all modes. Tilted magnetic fields are very effective in tuning
the emergent phonons, such that all modes except the Goldstone mode can be
excited by AC magnetic fields when a tilted bias field is presented.

verifying and validating automated driving functions. For this purpose,
scenarios have to be generated during the development process in a traceable
manner. In early development stages, the operating scenarios of the item to be
developed are usually described in an abstract, linguistic way.Within the scope
of a simulation-assisted test process, these linguistically described scenarios
have to be transformed into a state space representation and converted into
data formats which can be used with the respective simulation environment.
Currently, this step of detailing scenarios takes a considerable manual effort.
Furthermore, a standardized interpretation of the linguistically described
scenarios and a consistent transformation into the data formats are not
guaranteed due to multiple authors as well as many constraints between the
scenario parameters. In this paper, the authors present an approach to
automatically detail a keyword-based scenario description for execution in a
simulation environment and provide a basis for test case generation. As a first
step, the keyword-based description is transformed into a parameter space
representation. At the same time, constraints regarding the selection and
combination of parameter values are documented for the following process steps
(e. g. evolutionary or stochastic test methods). As a second step, the
parameter space representation is converted into data formats required by the
simulation environment. As an example, the authors use scenarios on German
freeways and convert them into the data formats OpenDRIVE (description of the
road) and OpenSCENARIO (description of traffic participants and environmental
conditions) for execution in the simulation environment Virtual Test Drive.

development of resistance to vacuum arcing over the operational life of the
system. This is, for instance, seen during the initial operation of radio
frequency (rf) cavities in particle accelerators. It is a relevant topic for
any technology where breakdown limits performance, and where conditioning
continues for a significant duration of system runtime. Projected future linear
accelerators require structures with accelerating gradients of up to 100 MV/m.
Currently, this performance level is only achievable after a multi-month
conditioning period. In this work, a pulsed DC system applying voltage pulses
over parallel disk electrodes was used to study the conditioning process, with
the objective of obtaining insight into its underlying mechanics, and
ultimately, to find ways to shorten the conditioning process. Two kinds of
copper electrodes were tested: As-prepared machine-turned electrodes (""hard""
copper), and electrodes that additionally had been subjected to high
temperature treatments (""soft"" copper). The conditioning behaviour of the soft
electrodes was found to be similar to that of comparably treated accelerating
structures, indicating a similar conditioning process. The hard electrodes
reached the same ultimate performance as the soft electrodes much faster, with
a difference of more than an order of magnitude in the number of applied
voltage pulses. Two distinctly different distributions of breakdown locations
were observed on the two types of electrodes. Considered together, our results
support the crystal structure dislocation theory of breakdown, and suggest that
the conditioning of copper in high field systems such as rf accelerating
structures is dominated by material hardening.

alternatives for such an implementation that differ with respect to the

respect to network bandwidth requirements. These alternatives have been
analyzed theoretically before, but when implemented it becomes evident that
their usefulness cannot be predicted based on theoretical considerations alone.
It is the purpose of the present paper to account for both practical and
theoretical aspects in determining which alternative is most appropriate for an
implementation on industrial hardware. The smallest possible bandwidth is known
to result for a variant in which only the active set of constraints is
transmitted from the central to the local nodes. Since local nodes must
determine the control law from the active set in this case, which requires
matrix inversions, an unattractive computational cost results at first sight.
Somewhat surprisingly, the computational cost scales practically linearly in
the problem size when implemented. We confirm this result with a more detailed
theoretical complexity analysis than given in previous papers. All results are

First an Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) block is placed inside a re-entrant cavity
where the resulting hybrid mode is measured to be in the ultra strong coupling
regime. When fully hybridised the ratio between the coupling rate and uncoupled
mode frequencies is determined to be $g/\omega=0.46$. Next a thin YIG cylinder
is placed inside a loop gap cavity. The bright mode of this cavity couples to
the YIG sample and is similarly measured to be in the ultra strong coupling
regime with ratio of coupling rate to uncoupled mode frequencies as
$g/\omega=0.34$. A larger spin density medium such as lithium ferrite (LiFe) is
expected to improve couplings by a factor of 1.46 in both systems as coupling
strength is shown to be proportional to the square root of spin density and
magnetic moment. Such strongly coupled systems are potentially useful for
cavity QED, hybrid quantum systems and precision dark matter detection
experiments. The YIG disc in the loop gap cavity, is, in particular, shown to
be a strong candidate for dark matter detection. Finally, a LiFe sphere inside
a two post re-entrant cavity is considered. In past work it was shown that the
magnon mode in the sample has a turnover point in frequency. Additionally, it
was predicted that if the system was engineered such that it fully hybridised
at this turnover point the cavity-magnon polariton (CMP) transition frequency
would become insensitive to both first and second order magnetic bias field
fluctuations, a result useful for precision frequency applications. This work
implements such a system by engineering the cavity mode frequency to near this
turnover point, with suppression in sensitivity to second order bias magnetic
field fluctuations shown.

evaders and we would like to find them using sweeping agents. We assume that
the sweeping agents are in a line formation whose total length is 2r. We
propose procedures for designing a sweeping process that ensures the successful
completion of the task, thereby deriving conditions on the sweeping velocity of
the linear formation and its path. Successful completion of the task means that
evaders with a given limit on their velocity cannot escape the sweeping agents.
A simpler task for the sweeping formation is the confinement of the evaders to
their initial domain. The feasibility of completing these tasks depends on
geometric and dynamic constraints that impose a lower bound on the velocity
that the sweeper line formation must have. This critical velocity is derived to
ensure the satisfaction of the confinement task. Increasing the velocity above
the lower bound enables the agents to complete the search task as well. We
present results on the total search time as a function of the sweeping velocity
of the formation given the initial conditions on the size of the search region
and the maximal velocity of the evaders.

networks (LPWAN) where the users are self-powered by the energy harvested from

Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, we focus on long range (LoRa) networks
where the LoRa users are using the harvested energy to transmit data to a
gateway via different spreading codes. Precisely, we study the throughput
fairness optimization problem for LoRa users by jointly optimizing the
spreading factor (SF) assignment, energy harvesting (EH) time duration, and the
transmit power of LoRa users. First, through examination of the various
permutations of collisions among users, we derive a general expression of the
packet collision time between LoRa users, which depends on the SFs and EH
duration requirements. Then, after reviewing prior SF allocation work, we
develop two types of algorithms that either assure fair SF assignment indeed
purposefully 'unfair' allocation schemes for the LoRa users. Our results
unearth three new findings. Firstly, we demonstrate that, to maximize the
minimum rate, the unfair SF allocation algorithm outperforms the other
approaches. Secondly, considering the derived expression of packet collision
between simultaneous users, we are now able to improve the performance of the
minimum rate of LoRa users and show that it is protected from inter-SF
interference which occurs between users with different SFs. That is, imperfect
SF orthogonality has no impact on minimum rate performance. Finally, we have
observed that co-SF interference is the main limitation in the throughput
performance, and not the energy scarcity.

tangent background velocity profile in the two cases of hyperbolic tangent and
uniform background buoyancy stratifications. The system is forced in such a way
that these background profiles are a steady solution of the governing
equations. As is well-known, if the minimum gradient Richardson number of the
flow, $Ri_m$, is less than a certain critical value $Ri_c$, the flow is
linearly unstable to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in both cases. Using
Newton-Krylov iteration, we find steady, two-dimensional, finite amplitude
elliptical vortex structures, i.e. `Kelvin-Helmholtz billows', existing above
$Ri_c$. Bifurcation diagrams are produced using branch continuation, and we
explore how these diagrams change with varying $Re$. In particular, when $Re$
is sufficiently high we find that finite amplitude Kelvin-Helmholtz billows
exist at $Ri_m>1/4$, where the flow is linearly stable by the Miles-Howard
theorem. For the uniform background stratification, we give a simple
explanation of the dynamical system, showing the dynamics can be understood on
a two-dimensional manifold embedded in state space, and demonstrate the cases
in which the system is bistable. In the case of a hyperbolic tangent

localizations of facial landmarks employing a static model trained offline

results in that the static model limits its performance on sequential images

this question, we develop a fast and accurate online learning algorithm for
face alignment. Particularly, we incorporate on-line sequential extreme
learning machine into a parallel cascaded regression framework, coined
incremental cascade regression(ICR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first incremental cascaded framework with the non-linear regressor. One main
advantage of ICR is that the tracker model can be fast updated in an
incremental way without the entire retraining process when a new input is

flow termed neurovascular coupling is essential for normal brain function. This
mechanism of regulation is compromised in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In order to
determine whether a purely vascular dysfunction or a neuronal alteration of
blood vessels diameter control could be responsible for the impaired
neurovascular coupling observed in AD, blood vessels reactivity in response to
different pharmacological stimulations was examined in double transgenic
APPxPS1 mice model of AD. Blood vessels movements were monitored using infrared
videomicroscopy ex vivo, in cortical slices of 8 month-old APPxPS1 and wild
type (WT) mice. We quantified vasomotor responses induced either by direct
blood vessel stimulation with a thromboxane A 2 analogue, the U46619
(9,11-dideoxy-11a,9a-epoxymethanoprostaglandin F2) or via the stimulation of
interneurons with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) agonist DMPP
(1,1-Dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide). Using both types of stimulation, no
significant differences were detected for the amplitude of blood vessel
diameter changes between the transgenic APPxPS1 mice model of AD and WT mice,
although the kinetics of recovery were slower in APPxPS1 mice. We find that
activation of neocortical interneurons with DMPP induced both vasodilation via
Nitric Oxide (NO) release and constriction via Neuropeptide Y (NPY) release.
However, we observed a smaller proportion of reactive blood vessels following a
neuronal activation in transgenic mice compared with WT mice. Altogether, these
results suggest that in this mouse model of AD, deficiency in the cortical
neurovascular coupling essentially results from a neuronal rather than a
vascular dysfunction.

sufficient for counterfactual demand-prediction under interactions, are
insufficient for welfare-calculations. This is because distinct underlying

the Bayes optimal classifier for the F-score can be obtained by thresholding

UV-Visible spectra confirm that GQDs show optical absorption in the visible

with the increase of excitation wavelength. Dynamic light scattering (DLS)
analysis shows that the average size of the particles is found to be 65 nm. The
frequency dependent electrical transport properties of the GQDs are
investigated in a temperature range from 300 to 500 K. Most interestingly, for
the first time, the insulator to semiconductor transition of GQD is observed
near 400K. The transition mechanism of GQD is discussed with detailed
dielectric analysis. The effects of intercalated water on temperature dependent

explained in the framework of permittivity, conductivity and impedance
formalisms. The frequency dependent ac conductivity spectra follows the
Jonscher s universal power law. Cole-Cole model is used to investigate the

noise), another important objective of a binaural beamforming algorithm is to
preserve the spatial impression of the acoustic scene, which can be achieved by
preserving the binaural cues of all sound sources. While the binaural minimum
variance distortionless response (BMVDR) beamformer provides a good noise
reduction performance and preserves the binaural cues of the desired source, it
does not allow to control the reduction of the interfering sources and distorts
the binaural cues of the interfering sources and the background noise. Hence,
several extensions have been proposed. First, the binaural linearly constrained
minimum variance (BLCMV) beamformer uses additional constraints, enabling to
control the reduction of the interfering sources while preserving their
binaural cues. Second, the BMVDR with partial noise estimation (BMVDR-N) mixes
the output signals of the BMVDR with the noisy reference microphone signals,
enabling to control the binaural cues of the background noise. Merging the
advantages of both extensions, in this paper we propose the BLCMV with partial
noise estimation (BLCMV-N). We show that the output signals of the BLCMV-N can
be interpreted as a mixture of the noisy reference microphone signals and the
output signals of a BLCMV using an adjusted interference scaling parameter. We
provide a theoretical comparison between the BMVDR, the BLCMV, the BMVDR-N and
the proposed BLCMV-N in terms of noise and interference reduction performance

able to preserve the binaural cues of an interfering source (like the BLCMV),
while enabling to trade off between noise reduction performance and binaural

one-loop-dressed strong coupling theory that treats the monovalent salt at the

strong-coupling approach. It is shown that the adhesive force of the
multivalent counterions mediating the like-charge adsorption arises from their
strong condensation at the charged membrane. The resulting interfacial
counterion excess locally maximizes the screening ability of the electrolyte
and minimizes the electrostatic polymer grand potential. This translates into
an attractive force that pulls the polymer to the similarly charged membrane.
We show that the high counterion valency enables this adsorption transition
even at weakly charged membranes. Additionally, strongly charged membranes give
rise to salt-induced correlations and intensify the interfacial multivalent
counterion condensation, strenghtening the complexation of the polymer with the
like-charged membrane, as well as triggering the orientational transition of
the molecule prior to its adsorption. Finally, our theory provides two
additional key features as evidenced by previous adsorption experiments: first,
the critical counterion concentration for polymer adsorption decreases with the
rise of the counterion valency, and second, the addition of monovalent salt
enhances the screening of the membrane charges and suppresses salt
correlations. This weakens the interfacial multivalent counterion condensation
and results in the desorption of the polymer from the substrate.

that this trade-off has been named as ""the central problem in distributive

nets are central to the development of domain theory, providing intuitive

third-order arithmetic, as such nets suffice to obtain our main results. Over

in the context of Software Defined Networking (SDN). In SDN, controller
replicas are distributed and their state replicated for high availability
purposes. Malicious controller replicas, however, may destabilize the control
plane and manipulate the data plane, thus motivating the BFT requirement.
Nonetheless, deploying BFT in practice comes at a disadvantage of increased
traffic load stemming from replicated controllers, as well as a requirement for
proprietary switch functionalities, thus putting strain on switches' control
plane where particular BFT actions must be executed in software.
  P4BFT leverages an optimal strategy to decrease the total amount of messages
transmitted to switches that are the configuration targets of SDN controllers.
It does so by means of message comparison and deduction of correct messages in
the determined optimal locations in the data plane. In terms of the incurred
control plane load, our P4-based data plane extensions outperform the existing
solutions by ~33.2% and ~40.2% on average, in random 128-switch and

chemistry. In contrast to standard Monte Carlo, KMC permits the description of
time dependent dynamical processes and is not restricted to systems in
equilibrium. Recently KMC has been applied successfully in modelling of novel
energy materials such as Lithium-ion batteries and solar cells. We consider
general solid state systems which contain free, interacting particles which can
hop between localised sites in the material. The KMC transition rates for those
hops depend on the change in total potential energy of the system. For charged
particles this requires the frequent calculation of electrostatic interactions,
which is usually the bottleneck of the simulation. To avoid this issue and
obtain results in reasonable times, many studies replace the long-range
potential by a short range approximation. This, however, leads to systematic
errors and unphysical results. On the other hand standard electrostatic solvers
such as Ewald summation or fast Poisson solvers are highly inefficient or
introduce uncontrollable systematic errors at high resolution. In this paper we
describe how the Fast Multipole Method by Greengard and Rokhlin can be adapted
to overcome this issue by dramatically reducing computational costs. We exploit
the fact that each update in the transition rate calculation corresponds to a
single particle move and changes the configuration only by a small amount. This
allows us to construct an algorithm which scales linearly in the number of
charges for each KMC step, something which had not been deemed to be possible
before. We demonstrate the performance and parallel scalability of the method
by implementing it in a performance portable software library. We describe the
high-level Python interface of the code which makes it easy to adapt to
specific cases.

a constant effort in understanding and optimizing different statistics of the
AoI process for classical queueing systems. In addition to classical queuing
systems, more recently, systems with no queue or a unit capacity queue storing
the latest packet have been gaining importance as storing and transmitting
older packets do not reduce AoI at the receiver. Following this line of
research, we study the distribution of AoI for the GI/GI/1/1 and GI/GI/1/2*
systems, under non-preemptive scheduling. For any single-source-single-server
queueing system, we derive, using sample path analysis, a fundamental result
that characterizes the AoI violation probability, and use it to obtain
closed-form expressions for D/GI/1/1, M/GI/1/1 as well as systems that use
zero-wait policy. Further, when exact results are not tractable, we present a
simple methodology for obtaining upper bounds for the violation probability for
both GI/GI/1/1 and GI/GI/1/2* systems. An interesting feature of the proposed
upper bounds is that, if the departure rate is given, they overestimate the
violation probability by at most a value that decreases with the arrival rate.
Thus, given the departure rate and for a fixed average service, the bounds are
tighter at higher utilization.

simple liquids and measuring their viscosity is extended to the Vicsek-model
(VM) of active particles [Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 1226 (1995)] and its metric-free
version. The sheared systems exhibit a phenomenon that is similar to the skin
effect of an alternating electric current: momentum that is fed into the
boundaries of a layer decays mostly exponentially towards the center of the
layer. It is shown how two transport coefficients, i.e. the shear viscosity
$\nu$ and the momentum amplification coefficient $\lambda$, can be obtained by
fitting this decay with an analytical solution of the hydrodynamic equations
for the VM. The viscosity of the VM consists of two parts, a kinetic and a
collisional contribution. While analytical predictions already exist for the
former, a novel expression for the collisional part is derived by an
Enskog-like kinetic theory. To verify the predictions for the transport
coefficients, Green-Kubo relations were evaluated and transverse current
correlations were measured in independent simulations. Not too far to the
transition to collective motion, we find excellent agreement between the
different measurements of the transport coefficients. However, the measured
values of $\nu$ and $1-\lambda$ are always slightly higher than the mean-field
predictions, even at large mean free paths and at state points quite far from
the threshold to collective motion, that is, far in the disordered phase. These
findings seem to indicate that the mean-field assumption of molecular chaos is
much less reliable in systems with velocity-alignment rules such as the VM,
compared to models obeying detailed balance such as Multi-Particle Collision
Dynamics.

enable the learning of the joint image manifold of multiple MR contrasts to
investigate which contrasts are essential. Our experimental results showed that

this definition using two different settings of dynamic networks. The first
corresponds to networks of low dynamicity, where some links may be permanently
removed so long as the network remains connected. The second corresponds to
highly-dynamic networks, where communication links appear and disappear
arbitrarily often, subject only to the requirement that the entities are
temporally connected in a recurrent fashion ({\it i.e.} they can always reach
each other through temporal paths). Each context induces a different
interpretation of the notion of robustness.

as our focus the robustness of {\em maximal independent sets} (MIS). A graph
may or may not admit a robust MIS. We characterize the set of graphs \forallMIS

there is one player at each vertex of a loopless graph $G$, an adversary places
a hat of one of $K$ colors on the head of each player, two players can see each

simultaneously try to guess the color of their hat. The players cannot
communicate but collectively determine a strategy before the hats are placed.
The hat chromatic number, $\mu(G)$, is the largest number $K$ of colors such
that the players are able to fix a strategy that will ensure that for every
possible placement of hats at least one of the guesses correctly.
  We compute $\mu(G)$ for several classes of graphs, for others we establish
some bounds. We establish connections between the hat chromatic number, the
chromatic number and the coloring number. We also introduce several variants of
the game: with multiple guesses, restrictions on allowed strategies or

cavities in the infalling envelope. These cavities are illuminated by the

near-infrared and mid-infrared wavelengths. The variability of the scattered
light nebula in both total intensity and intensity as a function of position in
the scattered light nebula can provide important insights into the structure of
the inner disk that cannot be spatially resolved. Aims. We aim to determine the
likelihood that a warped inner disk is the origin of the surface brightness
variability in the bipolar scattered light nebula associated with L1527 IRS.
Methods. We present results from near-IR imaging conducted over the course of
seven years, with periods of monthly cadence monitoring. We used Monte Carlo
radiative transfer models to interpret the observations. Results. We find a
time varying, asymmetrical brightness in the scattered light nebulae within the
outflow cavities of the protostar. Starting in 2007, the surface brightnesses
of the eastern and western outflow cavities were roughly symmetric. Then, in
2009, the surface brightnesses of the cavities were found to be asymmetric,
with a substantial increase in surface brightness and a larger increase in the
eastern outflow cavity. More regular monitoring was conducted from 2011 to
2014, revealing a rotating pattern of surface brightness variability in
addition to a slow change of the eastern and western outflow cavities toward
symmetry, but still not as symmetric as observed in 2007. We find that an inner
disk warp is a feasible mechanism to produce the rotating pattern of surface
brightness variability.

long, slender, and motile protrusions from the cell body. They undergo active
regular oscillatory beating patterns that can propel cells, such as the algae
Chlamydomonas, through fluids. When many cilia beat in synchrony they can also
propel fluid along the surfaces of cells, as is the case of nodal cilia.
  The main structural elements inside the cilium are microtubules. There are
also molecular motors of the dynein family that actively power the motion of
the cilium. These motors transform chemical energy in the form of ATP into
mechanical forces that produce sliding displacement between the microtubules.
This sliding is converted to bending by constraints at the base and/or along
the length of the cilium. Forces and displacements within the cilium can
regulate dyneins and provide a feedback mechanism: the dyneins generate forces,
deforming the cilium; the deformations, in turn, regulate the dyneins. This
feedback is believed to be the origin of the coordination of dyneins in space
and time which underlies the regularity of the beat pattern.
  Goals and approach. While the mechanism by which dyneins bend the cilium is
understood, the feedback mechanism is much less clear. The two key questions
are: which forces and displacements are the most relevant in regulating the
beat? and how exactly does this regulation occur?
  In this thesis we develop a framework to describe the spatio-temporal
patterns of a cilium with different mechanisms of motor regulation.
Characterizing and comparing the predicted shapes and beat patterns of these
different mechanisms to those observed in experiments provides us with further
understanding on how dyneins are regulated. This comparison is done both, with
a linear model that can be analytically solved, as with a non-linear model that
we solve numerically.

strategy results from a suitable combination of losing ones. Simple stochastic
games exhibiting this paradox have been introduced around the turn of the
millennium. The common setting of these Parrondo games is that two rules, $A$
and $B$, are played at discrete time steps, following either a periodic pattern
or an aperiodic one, be it deterministic or random. These games can be mapped
onto 1D random walks. In capital-dependent games, the probabilities of moving
right or left depend on the walker's position modulo some integer $K$. In
history-dependent games, each step is correlated with the $Q$ previous ones. In
both cases the gain identifies with the velocity of the walker's ballistic
motion, which depends non-linearly on model parameters, allowing for the
possibility of Parrondo's paradox. Calculating the gain involves products of
non-commuting Markov matrices, which are somehow analogous to the transfer
matrices used in the physics of 1D disordered systems. Elaborating upon this
analogy, we study a paradigmatic Parrondo game of each class in the neutral
situation where each rule, when played alone, is fair. The main emphasis of
this systematic approach is on the dependence of the gain on the remaining
parameters and, above all, on the game, i.e., the rule pattern, be it periodic
or aperiodic, deterministic or random. One of the most original sides of this
work is the identification of weak-contrast regimes for capital-dependent and
history-dependent Parrondo games, and a detailed quantitative investigation of
the gain in the latter scaling regimes.

specifying and reasoning about reconfigurable systems. As the name suggests,
the formalism we develop extends (many-sorted) first-order logic with features
that are common to hybrid logics and to dynamic logics. This provides certain
key advantages for dealing with reconfigurable systems, such as: (a) a
signature of nominals, including operation and relation symbols, that allows
references to specific possible worlds / system configurations -- as in the
case of hybrid logics; (b) distinguished signatures of rigid and flexible
symbols, where the rigid symbols are interpreted uniformly across possible
worlds; this supports a rigid form of quantification, which ensures that
variables have the same interpretation regardless of the possible world where
they are evaluated; (c) hybrid terms, which increase the expressive power of
the logic in the context of rigid symbols; and (d) modal operators over
dynamic-logic actions, which are defined as regular expressions over binary
nominal relations. We then study Horn clauses in this hybrid-dynamic logic, and
develop a series of results that lead to an initial-semantics theorem for
arbitrary sets of clauses. This shows that a significant fragment of
hybrid-dynamic first-order logic has good computational properties, and can
serve as a basis for defining executable languages for reconfigurable systems.
Lastly, we set out the foundations of logic programming in this fragment by
proving a hybrid-dynamic variant of Herbrand's theorem, which reduces the
semantic entailment of a logic-programming query by a program to the search of
a suitable answer substitution.

from a source to a destination for firefighting). Achieving their fast travel
and low motion energy without inter-UAV collision under wind perturbation is a
daunting control task, which incurs huge communication energy for exchanging
UAV states in real time. We tackle this problem by exploiting a mean-field game
(MFG) theoretic control method that requires the UAV state exchanges only once
at the initial source. Afterwards, each UAV can control its acceleration by
locally solving two partial differential equations (PDEs), known as the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations.
This approach, however, brings about huge computation energy for solving the

utilizing a machine learning (ML) method where two separate ML models
approximate the solutions of the HJB and FPK equations. These ML models are
trained and exploited using an online gradient descent method with low

properties of correlated-electron materials, but their realistic prediction
remains a formidable challenge. An archetypical example is the ternary nickel
oxide system RNiO3 (R = rare earth), where the period-four magnetic order with
proposals of collinear and non-collinear structures and the amplitude of
magnetic moments on different Ni sublattices have been subjects of debate for
decades. Here we introduce an elementary model system - NdNiO3 slabs embedded
in a non-magnetic NdGaO3 matrix - and use polarized resonant x-ray scattering
(RXS) to show that both collinear and non-collinear magnetic structures can be
realized, depending on the slab thickness. The crossover between both spin
structures is correctly predicted by density functional theory and can be
qualitatively understood in a low-energy spin model. We further demonstrate
that the amplitude ratio of magnetic moments in neighboring NiO6 octahedra can
be accurately determined by RXS in combination with a correlated double cluster
model. Targeted synthesis of model systems with controlled thickness and
synergistic application of polarized RXS and ab-initio theory thus provide new
perspectives for research on complex magnetism, in analogy to two-dimensional
materials created by exfoliation.

matching, etc.) can be expressed as \emph{subset maximization problems}: One is
given a ground set $N=\{1,\dots,n\}$, a collection $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^N$
of subsets thereof such that $\emptyset\in\mathcal{F}$, and an objective
(profit) function $p:\mathcal{F}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_+$. The task is to choose
a set $S\in\mathcal{F}$ that maximizes $p(S)$. We consider the
\emph{multistage} version (Eisenstat et al., Gupta et al., both ICALP 2014) of
such problems: The profit function $p_t$ (and possibly the set of feasible
solutions $\mathcal{F}_t$) may change over time. Since in many applications
changing the solution is costly, the task becomes to find a sequence of
solutions that optimizes the trade-off between good per-time solutions and
stable solutions taking into account an additional similarity bonus. As
similarity measure for two consecutive solutions, we consider either the size
of the intersection of the two solutions or the difference of $n$ and the
Hamming distance between the two characteristic vectors. We study multistage
subset maximization problems in the \emph{online} setting, that is, $p_t$
(along with possibly $\mathcal{F}_t$) only arrive one by one and, upon such an
arrival, the online algorithm has to output the corresponding solution without
knowledge of the future. We develop general techniques for online multistage
subset maximization and thereby characterize those models (given by the type of
data evolution and the type of similarity measure) that admit a
constant-competitive online algorithm. When no constant competitive ratio is
possible, we employ lookahead to circumvent this issue. When a constant
competitive ratio is possible, we provide almost matching lower and upper
bounds on the best achievable one.

destruction of the shared entanglement. In the standard teleportation scheme,
the sender's measurement on the shared entangled state between the sender and
the receiver has that consequence. We propose here a teleportation scheme
involving weak measurements which can sustain entanglement upto a certain level
so that the reusability of the shared resource state is possible. The
measurements are chosen in such a way that it is weak enough to retain
entanglement and hence can be reused for quantum tasks, yet adequately strong
to ensure quantum advantage in the protocol. In this scenario, we report that
at most six sender-receiver duos can reuse the state, when the initial shared
state is entangled in a finite neighborhood of the maximally entangled state
and for a suitable choice of weak measurements. However, we observe that the
reusability number decreases with the decrease in the entanglement of the
initial shared state. Among the weakening strategies studied, Bell measurement
admixed with white noise performs better than any other low-rank weak
measurements in this situation.

intensively studied and is well understood. The ability of a solution of
amphiphilic molecules to develop micelles is depending on the concentration and
characterized by the critical micelle concentration (cmc), above which micelle
formation does occur. Recent studies use a lattice approach in order to
determine cmc and show that the correct modelling and analysis of cluster
formations is highly non-trivial. We developed a minimalistic coarse grained
model for amphiphilic molecules in the continuum and simulated the time
evolution via dynamic Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical (NVT) ensemble.
Starting from a homogeneous system we observed and characterized how the
initial fluctuations, yielding small aggregates of amphiphilic molecules, end
up in the growth of complete micelles. Our model is sufficiently versatile to
account for different structures of surfactant systems such as membranes,
micelles of variable radius and tubes at high particle densities by adjusting
particle density and potential properties. Particle densities and micellization
rates are investigated and an order parameter is introduced, so that the
dependence of the micellization process on temperature and surfactant density
can be studied. The constant density of free particles for concentrations above
cmc, e. g. as expected from theoretical considerations, can be reproduced when
choosing a careful definition of free volumes. In the cmc regime at low
temperatures different non-equilibrium effects are reported, occurring even for
very long time-scales.

of the radio jet with the ambient gas producing shocks that are the main

high-frequency electronics while their maximum output powers are limited by
high channel temperature induced by near-junction Joule-heating, which degrades
device performance and reliability. Increasing the TBC between GaN and SiC will
aid in the heat dissipation of GaN-on-SiC power devices, taking advantage of
the high thermal conductivity of the SiC substrate. However, a good
understanding of the TBC of this technically important interface is still
lacking due to the complicated nature of interfacial heat transport. In this
work, a lattice-mismatch-insensitive surface activated bonding method is used
to bond GaN directly to SiC and thus eliminating the AlN layer altogether. This
allows for the direct integration of high quality GaN layers with SiC to create
a high thermal boundary conductance interface. TDTR is used to measure the
thermal properties of the GaN thermal conductivity and GaN-SiC TBC. The
measured GaN thermal conductivity is larger than that of GaN grown by MBE on
SiC, showing the impact of reducing the dislocations in the GaN near the
interface. High GaN-SiC TBC is observed for the bonded GaN-SiC interfaces,
especially for the annealed interface whose TBC (230 MW/m2-K) is close to the
highest values ever reported. To understand the structure-thermal property
relation, STEM and EELS are used to characterize the interface structure. The
results show that, for the as-bonded sample, there exists an amorphous layer
near the interface for the as bonded samples. This amorphous layer is
crystallized upon annealing, leading to the high TBC found in our work. Our
work paves the way for thermal transport across bonded interfaces, which will
impact real-world applications of semiconductor integration and packaging.

excellent matching with the volume flow rate over the cardiac cycle (less than

of deviations from isotropy at intermediate angular scales (about 20 degrees)
at the highest energies. In this contribution, we map the flux of UHECRs over
the full sky at energies beyond each of two major features in the UHECR
spectrum -- the ankle and the flux suppression --, and we derive limits for
anisotropy on different angular scales in the two energy regimes. In
particular, full-sky coverage enables constraints on low-order multipole
moments without assumptions about the strength of higher-order multipoles.
Following previous efforts from the two Collaborations, we build full-sky maps
accounting for the relative exposure of the arrays and differences in the

minimum description length principle. In the second stage, to account for the
intrinsic geometric structure of samples embedded in each subspace, MISC
performs graph regularized semi-nonnegative matrix factorization to explore
clusters. It additionally integrates the kernel trick into matrix factorization
to handle non-linearly separable clusters. Experimental results on synthetic

outcome, immune to the knowledge that the players have of them. Solutions
concepts implementing this approach have been defined on both dynamic games
with perfect information and no ties, the Perfect Prediction Equilibrium, and
strategic games with no ties, the Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium.
  In this paper, we generalize the Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium to games
in extensive form with imperfect information and no ties. Both the Perfect
Prediction Equilibrium and the Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium for strategic
games become special cases of this generalized equilibrium concept. The
generalized equilibrium, if there are no ties in the payoffs, is at most
unique, and is Pareto-optimal.
  We also contribute a special-relativistic interpretation of a subclass of the
games in extensive form with imperfect information as a directed acyclic graph
of decisions made by any number of agents, each decision being located at a
specific position in Minkowski spacetime, and the information sets and game
structure being derived from the causal structure. Strategic games correspond
to a setup with only spacelike-separated decisions, and dynamic games to one
with only timelike-separated decisions.
  The generalized Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium thus characterizes the
outcome and payoffs reached in a general setup where decisions can be located
in any generic positions in Minkowski spacetime, under necessary rationality
and necessary knowledge of strategies. We also argue that this provides a
directly usable mathematical framework for the design of extension theories of

accurate mask. We evaluated T-Net for the problem of segmenting three main
vessels in coronary angiography images. The experiment consisted of a
comparison of U-Net and T-Nets under the same conditions, and an optimized
T-Net for the main vessel segmentation. As a result, T-Net recorded a Dice
Similarity Coefficient score (DSC) of 0.815, 0.095 higher than that of U-Net,
and the optimized T-Net recorded a DSC of 0.890 which was 0.170 higher than
that of U-Net. In addition, we visualized the weight activation of the
convolutional layer of T-Net and U-Net to show that T-Net actually predicts the
mask from earlier decoders. Therefore, we expect that T-Net can be effectively
applied to other similar medical image segmentation problems.

It can be shown that these fairness processes do not converge in the usual

classifying permutation polynomials (PPs) of a given degree $d$ over finite

$d$. Previous classifications of PPs of degree at most $6$ were essentially
deduced from manual analysis of these polynomial equations. However, these
polynomials, needed for that purpose when $d>6$, are too complicated to solve.
Our idea is to make them more solvable by calculating some radicals of ideals

algorithms running in SageMath 8.6 on a personal computer work very fast to
determine all PPs of degree $8$ over an arbitrary finite field of odd order

control problems of technical systems. A major driver behind self-adaptation is
the idea to transfer traditional design-time decisions to runtime and into the
responsibility of systems themselves. In order to deal with unforeseen events
and conditions, systems need creativity -- typically realized by means of
machine learning capabilities. Such learning mechanisms are based on different
sources of knowledge. Feedback from the environment used for reinforcement
purposes is probably the most prominent one within the self-adapting and
self-organizing (SASO) systems community. However, the impact of other
(sub-)systems on the success of the individual system's learning performance
has mostly been neglected in this context. In this article, we propose a novel
methodology to identify effects of actions performed by other systems in a
shared environment on the utility achievement of an autonomous system. Consider
smart cameras (SC) as illustrating example: For goals such as 3D reconstruction
of objects, the most promising configuration of one SC in terms of
pan/tilt/zoom parameters depends largely on the configuration of other SCs in
the vicinity. Since such mutual influences cannot be pre-defined for dynamic
systems, they have to be learned at runtime. Furthermore, they have to be taken
into consideration when self-improving the own configuration decisions based on
a feedback loop concept, e.g., known from the SASO domain or the Autonomic and
Organic Computing initiatives. We define a methodology to detect such
influences at runtime, present an approach to consider this information in a

classification accuracy in several benchmarks, composing patterns with

go beyond pattern classification by introducing a new type of TMs, namely, the
Regression Tsetlin Machine (RTM). In all brevity, we modify the inner inference
mechanism of the TM so that input patterns are transformed into a single
continuous output, rather than to distinct categories. We achieve this by: (1)
using the conjunctive clauses of the TM to capture arbitrarily complex
patterns; (2) mapping these patterns to a continuous output through a novel
voting and normalization mechanism; and (3) employing a feedback scheme that
updates the TM clauses to minimize the regression error. The feedback scheme
uses a new activation probability function that stabilizes the updating of
clauses, while the overall system converges towards an accurate input-output
mapping. The performance of the RTM is evaluated using six different artificial
datasets with and without noise, in comparison with the Classic Tsetlin Machine
(CTM) and the Multiclass Tsetlin Machine (MTM). Our empirical results indicate
that the RTM obtains the best training and testing results for both noisy and

particular block variable is selected and updated by inexactly solving the
original optimization problem with respect to that block variable. More
precisely, a local approximation of the original optimization problem is
solved. The proposed algorithm has several attractive features, namely, i) high
flexibility, as the approximation function only needs to be strictly convex and
it does not have to be a global upper bound of the original function; ii) fast
convergence, as the approximation function can be designed to exploit the
problem structure at hand and the stepsize is calculated by the line search;
iii) low complexity, as the approximation subproblems are much easier to solve
and the line search scheme is carried out over a properly constructed
differentiable function; iv) guaranteed convergence of a subsequence to a
stationary point, even when the objective function does not have a Lipschitz
continuous gradient. Interestingly, when the approximation subproblem is solved
by a descent algorithm, convergence of a subsequence to a stationary point is
still guaranteed even if the approximation subproblem is solved inexactly by
terminating the descent algorithm after a finite number of iterations. These
features make the proposed algorithm suitable for large-scale problems where
the dimension exceeds the memory and/or the processing capability of the

In the addressed set-up, the dimension of the decision variable can be

algorithm consists of two main steps: a consensus step and an update on a
single block of the optimization variable, which is then broadcast to
neighbors. Three special instances of the proposed method, involving particular
problem structures, are then presented. In the general case, the convergence of
a dynamic consensus algorithm over random row stochastic matrices is shown.
Then, the convergence of the proposed algorithm to the optimal cost is proven
in expected value. Exact convergence is achieved when using diminishing (local)
stepsizes, while approximate convergence is attained when constant stepsizes
are employed. The convergence rate is shown to be sublinear and an explicit
rate is provided in the case of constant stepsizes. Finally, the algorithm is

successful training of the cluster assumption is to impose the
locally-Lipschitz constraint to the model. Existing methods only impose the
locally-Lipschitz constraint around the training points while miss the other
areas, such as the points in-between training data. In this paper, we address

areas in-between training data. Unlike the traditional mixup model, our method
constructs the combination samples without using the label information,
allowing it to apply to unsupervised domain adaptation. The proposed method is
generic and can be combined with most existing models such as the recent
state-of-the-art model called VADA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMT
significantly improves the performance of VADA on six domain adaptation
benchmark datasets. For the challenging task of adapting MNIST to SVHN, VMT can
improve the accuracy of VADA by over 30\%. Code is available at

Background (CMB) has become a powerful tool for probing the matter distribution
in the Universe. The standard technique used to reconstruct the CMB lensing
signal employs the quadratic estimator (QE) method, which has recently been
shown to be suboptimal for lensing measurements on very small scales in
temperature and polarization data. We implement a simple, more optimal method
for the small-scale regime, which involves taking the direct inverse of the
background gradient. We derive new techniques to make continuous maps of
lensing using this ""Gradient-Inversion"" (GI) method and validate our method
with simulated data, finding good agreement with predictions. For idealized
simulations of lensing cross- and autospectra that neglect foregrounds, we
demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than previous
quadratic estimator methods in temperature; at $L=5000-9000$, it reduces errors
on the lensing auto-power spectrum by a factor of $\sim 4$ for both idealized
CMB-S4 and Simons Observatory-like experiments and by a factor of $\sim 2.6$
for cross-correlations of CMB-S4-like lensing reconstruction and the true
lensing field. We caution that the level of the neglected small-scale
foreground power, while low in polarization, is very high in temperature;
though we briefly outline foreground mitigation methods, further work on this
topic is required. Nevertheless, our results show the future potential for
improved small-scale CMB lensing measurements, which could provide stronger
constraints on cosmological parameters and astrophysics at high redshifts.

p<p_c$, and a spin glass for $p_c < p \le 0.5$ where $p_c \simeq 0.222$. We
investigate the percolation transition of the Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters as

transition occurs at a higher temperature than the magnetic ordering
temperature. This was known before for $p=1/2$ but here we provide evidence for
a difference in transition temperatures even for $p$ arbitrarily small.
Furthermore, for all values of $p>0$, our data suggest that the percolation
transition is universal, irrespective of whether the ground state exhibits
ferromagnetic or spin-glass order, and is in the universality class of standard
percolation. This shows that correlations in the bond occupancy of the
Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters are irrelevant, except for $p=0$ where the clusters

ODF-Fingerprinting (ODF-FP). In ODF-FP, fiber configurations are selected based
on the similarity between measured ODFs and elements in a pre-computed library.
In noisy ODFs, the library matching algorithm penalizes the more complex fiber
configurations. ODF simulations and analysis of bootstrapped partial and
whole-brain in vivo datasets show that the ODF-FP approach improves the
detection of fiber pairs with small crossing angles while maintaining fiber
direction precision, which leads to better tractography results. Rather than
focusing on the ODF maxima, the ODF-FP approach uses the whole ODF shape to
infer fiber directions to improve the detection of fiber bundles with small
crossing angle. The resulting fiber directions aid tractography algorithms in
accurately displaying neuronal tracts and calculating brain connectivity.

condition. Quantitative OCTA features, including blood vessel tortuosity (BVT),
blood vascular caliber (BVC), vessel perimeter index (VPI), blood vessel

modeling, the amount of information increases along the position dimension,

\rsun, central and outer vertical thickness of 1.6 \rsun\ and 3.5 \rsun, and
temperature of 9380 K at its outer edge. Two shock regions located at roughly
opposite parts of the outer disk rim can explain the light curves asymmetries.
The system is a member of the double periodic variables and its relatively
high-mass and long photometric cycle make it similar in some aspects to $\beta$
Lyrae.

  arXiv:1804.04192",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is capable of
processing complex sequential information since it utilizes special gating
schemes for learning representations from long input sequences. It has the
potential to model any sequential time-series data, where the current hidden
state has to be considered in the context of the past hidden states. This
property makes LSTM an ideal choice to learn the complex dynamics present in
long sequences. Unfortunately, the conventional LSTMs do not consider the
impact of spatio-temporal dynamics corresponding to the given salient motion
patterns, when they gate the information that ought to be memorized through
time. To address this problem, we propose a differential gating scheme for the
LSTM neural network, which emphasizes on the change in information gain caused
by the salient motions between the successive video frames. This change in
information gain is quantified by Derivative of States (DoS), and thus the
proposed LSTM model is termed as differential Recurrent Neural Network (dRNN).
In addition, the original work used the hidden state at the last time-step to
model the entire video sequence. Based on the energy profiling of DoS, we
further propose to employ the State Energy Profile (SEP) to search for salient
dRNN states and construct more informative representations. The effectiveness
of the proposed model was demonstrated by automatically recognizing human
actions from the real-world 2D and 3D single-person action datasets. We point
out that LSTM is a special form of dRNN. As a result, we have introduced a new
family of LSTMs. Our study is one of the first works towards demonstrating the
potential of learning complex time-series representations via high-order
derivatives of states.

When we include a repulsive acceleration $a_{\rm de}$ due to dark energy, the
resulting universal expansion is then driven totally by this new term and the
solutions for $a_{\rm de}\to 0$ do not reduce to those of the $a_{\rm de}\equiv

on energy-constrained mobile platforms. This work optimizes energy on a mobile
client by partitioning CNN computations between in situ processing on the
client and offloaded computations in the cloud. A new analytical CNN energy
model is formulated, capturing all major components of the in situ computation,
for ASIC-based deep learning accelerators. The model is benchmarked against
measured silicon data. The analytical framework is used to determine the
optimal energy partition point between the client and the cloud at runtime. On
standard CNN topologies, partitioned computation is demonstrated to provide
significant energy savings on the client over fully cloud-based or fully in
situ computation. For example, at 80 Mbps effective bit rate and 0.78 W
transmission power, the optimal partition for AlexNet [SqueezeNet] saves up to
52.4% [73.4%] energy over a fully cloud-based computation, and 27.3% [28.8%]

opened a new avenue in the characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres and in

sustainment of life as we know it in other worlds, we need to understand the
nature of astrospheric, atmospheric and surface environments of exoplanets in
habitable zones around G-K-M dwarfs including our young Sun. Global environment
is formed by propagated disturbances from the planet-hosting stars in the form
of stellar flares, coronal mass ejections, energetic particles, and winds
collectively known as astrospheric space weather. Its characterization will
help in understanding how an exoplanetary ecosystem interacts with its host
star, as well as in the specification of the physical, chemical and biochemical
conditions that can create favorable and/or detrimental conditions for
planetary climate and habitability along with evolution of planetary internal
dynamics over geological timescales. A key linkage of (astro) physical,
chemical, and geological processes can only be understood in the framework of
interdisciplinary studies with the incorporation of progress in heliophysics,
astrophysics, planetary and Earth sciences. The assessment of the impacts of
host stars on the climate and habitability of terrestrial (exo)planets will
significantly expand the current definition of the habitable zone to the
biogenic zone and provide new observational strategies for searching for
signatures of life. The major goal of this paper is to describe and discuss the
current status and recent progress in this interdisciplinary field and to
provide a new roadmap for the future development of the emerging field of

provide observational evidence for high non-Gaussianity in the vicinity of a
transition to and from a geomagnetic superchron, consisting of a sharp increase
in high-order moments (skewness and kurtosis) of the dipole's distribution.
Such increase in the moments is a universal feature of crisis-induced
intermittency in low-dimensional dynamical systems undergoing global
bifurcations. This suggests temporal variation of the underlying parameters of
the physical system. Through a low dimensional system that models the
geomagnetic reversals we show that the increase in the high-order moments
during transitions to geomagnetic superchrons is caused by the progressive
destruction of global periodic orbits exhibiting both polarities as the system
approaches a merging bifurcation. We argue that the non-gaussianity in this

anchor word, defined as a word that has non-zero probability only on that
topic. SNMF focuses on the word co-occurrence patterns to reveal topics by two
steps: anchor word selection and topic recovery. The quality of the anchor
words strongly influences the quality of the extracted topics. Existing anchor
word selection algorithm is to greedily find an approximate convex hull in a
high-dimensional word co-occurrence space. In this work, we propose a new
method for the anchor word selection by associating the word co-occurrence
probability with the words similarity and assuming that the most different
words on semantic are potential candidates for the anchor words. Therefore, if
the similarity of a word-pair is very low, then the two words are very likely
to be the anchor words. According to the statistical information of text
corpora, we can get the similarity of all word-pairs. We build the word
similarity graph where the nodes correspond to words and weights on edges stand
for the word-pair similarity. Following this way, we design a greedy method to
find a minimum edge-weight anchor clique of a given size in the graph for the
anchor word selection. Extensive experiments on real-world corpus demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed anchor word selection method that outperforms
the common convex hull-based methods on the revealed topic quality. Meanwhile,
our method is much faster than typical SNMF based method.

other exact laws derived by Galtier (2008) and Banerjee & Galtier (2017) using
direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of three-dimensional electron MHD (EMHD)

are equivalent in the inertial range, thereby offering several choices on the
formulation to use depending on the needs. The expressions that depend
explicitly on a mean (guide) field may lead to residual errors in estimating
the energy cascade rate ; however, we demonstrate that this guide field can be

recommended to use an expression independent of the mean guide field to analyze

combining two aspects of urban mobility: (a) conformity: which reflects the

oncoming proliferation of 5G only amplifies their importance. Many such matrix
algorithms are inductive, and exhibit ample amounts of fine-grain ordered
parallelism -- when multiple computations flow with fine-grain
producer/consumer dependences, and where the iteration domain is not easily
tileable. Synchronization overheads make multi-core parallelism ineffective and
the non-tileable iterations make the vector-VLIW approach less effective,
especially for the typically modest-sized matrices. Because CPUs and DSPs lose
order-of-magnitude performance/hardware utilization, costly and inflexible
ASICs are often employed in signal processing pipelines. A programmable
accelerator with similar performance/power/area would be highly desirable. We
find that fine-grain ordered parallelism can be exploited by supporting: 1.
fine-grain stream-based communication/synchronization; 2. inductive data-reuse

hardware specialization of dataflow criticality. In this work, we propose,
REVEL, as a next-generation DSP architecture. It supports the above features in
its ISA and microarchitecture, and further uses a novel vector-stream control
paradigm to reduce control overheads. Across a suite of linear algebra kernels,
REVEL outperforms equally provisioned DSPs by 4.6x-37x in latency and achieves
a performance per mm 2 of 8.3x. It is only 2.2x higher power to achieve the

non-desirable short-channel effects in the MOSFETs family, which causes the
threshold voltage of the transistor to be reduced by increasing the voltage of
the drain. This effect makes it impossible for circuit designers to consider VT
as a constant value, and hence, it is necessary to calculate VT as a function
of the drain voltage. Therefore, to consider the effect of DIBL in the design
of integrated circuits, a large computational burden is imposed on the system,
which slows down the simulation process in circuit-level simulators,
particularly when a large number of transistors are to be simulated.
Accordingly, in this paper, a multiple input single output (MISO) Nonlinear
Autoregressive (N-AR) model using the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization approach
is proposed, that calculates the threshold voltage of the new generation of
MOSFETs, i.e., Junctionless Double-Gate MOSFETs (JL-DG-MOSFETs), with a high
precision and a significant speed-up in the computational procedure of the
model. It is shown that, on average, the proposed numerical method is 313 times
faster than the state-of-the-art analytical model. The calculated percentage of
normalized mean square error between the proposed model and analytical one is
0.435% on average, showing that the proposed approach can be a fast and

but are basically directionless in search space and computational expensive in
training of every intermediate architecture. In this paper, we propose a method
for efficient architecture search called EENA (Efficient Evolution of Neural
Architecture). Due to the elaborately designed mutation and crossover
operations, the evolution process can be guided by the information have already
been learned. Therefore, less computational effort will be required while the
searching and training time can be reduced significantly. On CIFAR-10
classification, EENA using minimal computational resources (0.65 GPU-days) can
design highly effective neural architecture which achieves 2.56% test error
with 8.47M parameters. Furthermore, the best architecture discovered is also
transferable for CIFAR-100.

model-freely reveal the dynamical properties of a black-box system using a
learning machine. Trained only by a segment of time series of a state variable
recorded at present parameters values, the dynamics of the learning machine at
different training stages can be mapped to the dynamics of the target system
along a particular path in its parameter space, following an appropriate
training strategy that monotonously decreases the cost function. This path is
important, because along that, the primary dynamical properties of the target
system will subsequently emerge, in the simple-to-complex order, matching
closely the evolution law of certain self-evolved systems in nature. Why such a
path can be reproduced is attributed to our training strategy. This particular
function of the learning machine opens up a novel way to probe the global
dynamical properties of a black-box system without artificially establish the
equations of motion, and as such it might have countless applications. As an
example, this method is applied to infer what dynamical stages a variable star
has experienced and how it will evolve in future, by using the light curve
observed presently.

Data taken from SoCs to achieve this is often characterised by very long

paper explains and empirically compares the accuracy of several methods used to
detect the existence of these relationships in a wide range of systems. A
probabilistic model is used to construct and test a large number of SoC-like
systems with known relationships which are compared with the estimated
relationships to give accuracy scores. The metrics \.Cov and \.Dep based on
covariance and independence are demonstrated to be the most useful, whereas

studied in controlled environments. Consequently, off-the shelf tools for
categorization of gaze events (e.g. fixations, pursuits, saccade) fail when
head movements are allowed. Our approach was to collect a novel, naturalistic,
and multimodal dataset of eye+head movements when subjects performed everyday
tasks while wearing a mobile eye tracker equipped with an inertial measurement
unit and a 3D stereo camera. This Gaze-in-the-Wild dataset (GW) includes
eye+head rotational velocities (deg/s), infrared eye images and scene imagery
(RGB+D). A portion was labelled by coders into gaze motion events with a mutual
agreement of 0.72 sample based Cohen's $\kappa$. This labelled data was used to
train and evaluate two machine learning algorithms, Random Forest and a
Recurrent Neural Network model, for gaze event classification. Assessment
involved the application of established and novel event based performance
metrics. Classifiers achieve $\sim$90$\%$ human performance in detecting
fixations and saccades but fall short (60$\%$) on detecting pursuit movements.
Moreover, pursuit classification is far worse in the absence of head movement
information. A subsequent analysis of feature significance in our
best-performing model revealed a reliance upon absolute eye and head velocity,
indicating that classification does not require spatial alignment of the head
and eye tracking coordinate systems. The GW dataset, trained classifiers and
evaluation metrics will be made publicly available with the intention of
facilitating growth in the emerging area of head-free gaze event
classification.

followed by a generative neural networks (GANs) aimed to generate realistic
images conditioned on the text features. These works mainly focus on generating
spatially compact and well-defined categories of objects, such as birds or
flowers. In contrast, meal images are significantly more complex, consisting of
multiple ingredients whose appearance and spatial qualities are further
modified by cooking methods. We propose a method that first builds an
attention-based ingredients-image association model, which is then used to
condition a generative neural network tasked with synthesizing meal images.
Furthermore, a cycle-consistent constraint is added to further improve image
quality and control appearance. Extensive experiments show our model is able to
generate meal image corresponding to the ingredients, which could be used to
augment existing dataset for solving other computational food analysis

considers the time evolution of the mobile users' orientations as well as the

objective of each mobile user is then to find the optimal transmission power
that maximizes its energy efficiency. The expression of the energy efficiency
is analytically derived for the realistic case of a finite size network.
Simulation results show that the proposed approach yields gains of up to 24%,
in terms of energy efficiency, compared to a baseline in which the nodes

requires acoustic transformations from sound waveforms with varying amplitudes
to frequency domain maps that can be seen as feature extraction techniques.
Depending on the conversion method, these may obscure the contribution of the
neuromorphic hardware to the overall speech recognition performance. Here, we
quantify and separate the contributions of the acoustic transformations and the
neuromorphic hardware to the speech recognition success rate. We show that the
non-linearity in the acoustic transformation plays a critical role in feature
extraction. We compute the gain in word success rate provided by a reservoir
computing device compared to the acoustic transformation only, and show that it
is an appropriate benchmark for comparing different hardware. Finally, we
experimentally and numerically quantify the impact of the different acoustic
transformations for neuromorphic hardware based on magnetic nano-oscillators.
