Centauri across an extended time of 13.2 years, from May 27, 2004, to September
30, 2017.
  Aims. We analyse the common behaviour and differences in the intensities and
profiles of different emission lines in flare and quiet modes of Proxima
activity.
  Methods. We compare the pseudo-equivalent widths (pEW) and profiles of the
emission lines in the HARPS high-resolution (R ~ 115,000) spectra observed at
the same epochs.
  Results. All emission lines show variability with a timescale of at least 10
min. The strength of all lines except He I 4026 A correlate with \Halpha.
During strong flares the `red asymmetry' appears in the Halpha emission line
indicating the infall of hot condensed matter into the chromosphere with
velocities greater than 100 km/s disturbing chromospheric layers. As a result,
the strength of the Ca II lines anti-correlates with Halpha during strong
flares. The He I lines at 4026 and 5876 A appear in the strong flares. The
cores of D1 and D2 Na I lines are also seen in emission. During the minimum
activity of Proxima Centauri, Ca II lines and Hepsilon almost disappear while
the blue part of the Na I emission lines is affected by the absorption in the
extending and condensing flows.
  Conclusions. We see different behaviour of emission lines formed in the flare
regions and chromosphere. Chromosphere layers of Proxima Cen are likely heated
by the flare events; these layers are cooled in the `non-flare' mode. The
self-absorption structures in cores of our emission lines vary with time due to
the presence of a complicated system of inward and outward matter flows in the
absorbing layers.

Linguistics and Cognitive Science in modeling various semantic phenomena, such

status of distributional semantics within a broader theory of language and
cognition is still unclear: What does distributional semantics model? Can it
be, on its own, a fully adequate model of the meanings of linguistic
expressions? The standard answer is that distributional semantics is not fully
adequate in this regard, because it falls short on some of the central aspects
of formal semantic approaches: truth conditions, entailment, reference, and
certain aspects of compositionality. We argue that this standard answer rests
on a misconception: These aspects do not belong in a theory of expression
meaning, they are instead aspects of speaker meaning, i.e., communicative
intentions in a particular context. In a slogan: words do not refer, speakers
do. Clearing this up enables us to argue that distributional semantics on its
own is an adequate model of expression meaning. Our proposal sheds light on the
role of distributional semantics in a broader theory of language and cognition,
its relationship to formal semantics, and its place in computational models.

Kalman Filters (KFs) (Kalman et al., 1960) have been integrated with deep

inference techniques such as variational inference which makes learning more
complex and often less scalable due to approximation errors. We propose a new
deep approach to Kalman filtering which can be learned directly in an
end-to-end manner using backpropagation without additional approximations. Our
approach uses a high-dimensional factorized latent state representation for
which the Kalman updates simplify to scalar operations and thus avoids hard to
backpropagate, computationally heavy and potentially unstable matrix
inversions. Moreover, we use locally linear dynamic models to efficiently
propagate the latent state to the next time step. The resulting network
architecture, which we call Recurrent Kalman Network (RKN), can be used for any
time-series data, similar to a LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) but uses
an explicit representation of uncertainty. As shown by our experiments, the RKN
obtains much more accurate uncertainty estimates than an LSTM or Gated
Recurrent Units (GRUs) (Cho et al., 2014) while also showing a slightly
improved prediction performance and outperforms various recent generative
models on an image imputation task.

QCRTF can be made independent of the single-particle basis and allow to

QCRTF can be formulated in such a way that neither Bose-Einstein condensates

The QCRTF framework is utilized to calculate the optimal asymptotic

aerosol injection (SAI), a form of solar geoengineering, is increasingly
considered in order to artificially mitigate climate change effects. However,
initial research in simulation suggests that naive SAI can have catastrophic
regional consequences, which may induce serious geostrategic conflicts. Current
geo-engineering research treats SAI control in low-dimensional approximation
only. We suggest treating SAI as a high-dimensional control problem, with
policies trained according to a context-sensitive reward function within the
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) paradigm. In order to facilitate training in
simulation, we suggest to emulate HadCM3, a widely used General Circulation
Model, using deep learning techniques. We believe this is the first application
of DRL to the climate sciences.

search results with fluorocarbon target fluids, separated from the steel
bellows by a buffer layer of water. Surface tension effects at the jar walls
and liquid-liquid interface lead to a class of background events which have
nuclear-recoil-like acoustic signatures and thus contaminate the WIMP-like
signal region in analysis. Thus new bubble chambers are to be constructed
""right-side-up"", meaning that the jar of C$_3$F$_8$ is above the bellows with
no water inside the inner vessel. The Drexel Bubble Chamber (DBC), runs
successfully at and below the nuclear recoil thresholds used by PICO for WIMP
searches, including thresholds as low as 1.19 keV. We have demonstrated
sensitivity to $^{137}$Cs gammas and spontaneous fission neutrons from
$^{244}$Cm, and acoustic alpha discrimination is demonstrated to be possible
although the observed rate of alpha decays is very low. Position reconstruction
from stereoscopic imaging allows for basic analysis cuts for calibration data.
The successful construction and operation of this prototype confirm the
effectiveness of the right-side-up design, which will be used in future dark
matter searches such as PICO-40L and PICO-500.

neural networks. Addressing this issue requires a reliable way to evaluate the
robustness of a network. Recently, several methods have been developed to
compute $\textit{robustness quantification}$ for neural networks, namely,
certified lower bounds of the minimum adversarial perturbation. Such methods,
however, were devised for feed-forward networks, e.g. multi-layer perceptron or
convolutional networks. It remains an open problem to quantify robustness for

additional challenges in computing the robustness quantification, such as
handling the inputs at multiple steps and the interaction between gates and

of diffusive behavior. For the event statistics, we find that the distribution
of $S$ is similar to, but distinct from, the distribution of $M$. We find a
strong correlation between $S$ and $M$ for any particular event, with $S\sim
M^{q}$ with $q\approx 0.65$. $q$ completely determines the scaling exponents
for $P(M)$ given those for $P(S)$. For the distribution of local thresholds, we
find $P(x)$ is analytic at $x=0$, and has a value $\left.
P(x)\right|_{x=0}=p_0$ which scales with lateral system length as $p_0\sim
L^{-0.6}$. Extreme value statistics arguments lead to a scaling relation
between the exponents governing $P(x)$ and those governing $P(S)$. Finally, we
study the long-time correlations via single-particle tracer statistics. The
value of the diffusion coefficient is completely determined by $\langle \Delta

$\langle M \rangle$) rather than directly from $P(S)$ as one might have naively

the polarization modes of the transmitted qubit. This procedure works extremely
well when the output of the system is postselected on photon detection.
However, in cases where the qubit might be needed for further analysis this

communication happens over a dedicated network. For many practical
applications, however, communication must occur over shared networks, leading
to two critical design challenges, namely - time-delays in the feedback and
fair sharing of bandwidth among users. In this paper, we present a set of
sparse H2 control designs under these two design constraints. An important
aspect of our design is that the delay itself can be a function of sparsity,
which leads to an interesting pattern of trade-offs in the H2 performance. We
present three distinct algorithms. The first algorithm preconditions the
assignable bandwidth to the network and produces an initial guess for a
stabilizing controller. This is followed by our second algorithm, which
sparsifies this controller while simultaneously adapting the feedback delay and
optimizing the H2 performance using alternating directions method of
multipliers (ADMM). The third algorithm extends this approach to a multiple
user scenario where optimal number of communication links, whose total sum is
fixed, is distributed fairly among users by minimizing the variance of their H2
performances. The problem is cast as a difference-of-convex (DC) program with
mixed-integer linear program (MILP) constraints. We provide theorems to prove
convergence of these algorithms, followed by validation through numerical

either a ferro- or antiferromagnetic contribution to the exchange interaction.
This contribution can bias the statistics of the random exchange constants

Spectrally matched ground motions are employed to isolate the contribution of

also investigated whether or not this insignificant positive correlation has an

ground motions are divided into two distinct groups in this case: short and
long duration ground motions. The comparison of incremental dynamic analysis of

This technology is commonly prototyped and tested over FPGAs before being
considered for ASIC fabrication for mass production. The use of commercial
typical cameras (30fps) limits the capabilities of these systems for high speed

of a biological retina is taking an incremental importance to improve this
applications due to its nature, where the information is represented by a
continuous stream of spikes and the frames to be processed by the CNN are
constructed collecting a fixed number of these spikes (called events). The
faster an object is, the more events are produced by DVS, so the higher is the
equivalent frame rate. Therefore, these DVS utilization allows to compute a
frame at the maximum speed a CNN accelerator can offer. In this paper we
present a VHDL/HLS description of a pipelined design for FPGA able to collect
events from an Address-Event-Representation (AER) DVS retina to obtain a
normalized histogram to be used by a particular CNN accelerator, called
NullHop. VHDL is used to describe the circuit, and HLS for computation blocks,
which are used to perform the normalization of a frame needed for the CNN.
Results outperform previous implementations of frames collection and

adding a pseudospin anisotropy to the model. We demonstrate the physical need

of work on network-based dynamical processes. Most theoretical results in this
area rely on the so-called \emph{locally tree-like approximation}. This is,
however, usually an `uncontrolled' approximation, in the sense that the
magnitudes of the error are typically unknown, although numerical results show
that this error is often surprisingly small. In this paper, we place this
approximation on more rigorous footing by calculating the magnitude of
deviations away from tree-based theories in the context of discrete-time
critical network cascades with re-excitable nodes. We discuss the conditions
under which tree-like approximations give good results for calculating network
criticality, and also explain the reasons for deviation from this
approximation, in terms of the density of certain kinds of network motifs.
Using this understanding, we derive results for network criticality that apply
to general networks that explicitly do not satisfy the locally tree-like
approximation. In particular, we focus on the bi-parallel motif, the smallest
motif relevant to the failure of a tree-based theory in this context, and we
derive the corrections due to such motifs on the conditions for criticality. We
verify our claims on computer-generated networks, and we confirm that our
theory accurately predicts the observed deviations from criticality. Using our
theory, we explain why numerical simulations often show that deviations from a
tree-based theory are surprisingly small. More specifically, we show that these
deviations are negligible for networks whose average degree is even modestly
large compared to one, justifying why tree-based theories appear to work well
for most real-world networks.

to communicate is limited, they may obliviously search in overlapping regions
(i.e. be subject to interference). Interference hinders robot progress, and
strategies have been proposed in the literature to mitigate interference [1],

but the problem of mitigating interference when time for search is limited

on the method of cellular decomposition [3] where we employ the concept of soft
obstacles: a robot considers cells assigned to other robots as obstacles. The
performance of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by means of simulation
experiments. Simulations indicate the utility of the strategy in situations
where a known upper bound on the search time precludes search of the entire

incompressible and irrotational potentials that transport smoke towards

Algorithms that perform computations on large graphs are not always efficient.
This work investigates the Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) problem, which is
considered to be one of the most important and most studied graph problems.
This thesis contains a review of the SSSP problem in both theory and practice.
In addition, it discusses a new single-source shortest-path algorithm that
achieves the same $O(n \cdot m)$ time bound as the traditional
Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm but outperforms it and other state-of-the-art
algorithms in practice.
  The work is comprised of three parts. The first discusses some basic
shortest-path and negative-cycle-detection algorithms in literature from the
theoretical and practical point of view. The second contains a discussion of a
new algorithm for the single-source shortest-path problem that outperforms most
state-of-the-art algorithms for several well-known families of graphs. The main
idea behind the proposed algorithm is to select the fewest most-effective
vertices to scan. We also propose a discussion of correctness, termination, and
the proof of the worst-case time bound of the proposed algorithm. This section
also suggests two different implementations for the proposed algorithm, the
first runs faster while the second performs a fewer number of operations.
Finally, an extensive computational study of the different shortest paths
algorithms is conducted. The results are proposed using a new evaluation metric
for shortest-path algorithms. A discussion of outcomes, strengths, and
weaknesses of the various shortest path algorithms are also included in this
work.

render our approach different from classical graph-based SSL for vertex labels,
which posits that tightly connected nodes share similar labels and leverages
the graph structure accordingly to extrapolate from a few vertex labels to the
unlabeled vertices. We derive bounds for our method's reconstruction error and
demonstrate its strong performance on synthetic and real-world flow networks
from transportation, physical infrastructure, and the Web. Furthermore, we
provide two active learning algorithms for selecting informative edges on which

first strategy selects edges to minimize the reconstruction error bound and
works well on flows that are approximately divergence-free. The second approach
clusters the graph and selects bottleneck edges that cross cluster-boundaries,

possibility of increased statistical efficiency, reduced development cost and

Several recent efforts, under the theme of end-to-end RE, seek to exploit
inter-task correlations by modeling both NER and RE tasks jointly. Earlier work
in this area commonly reduces the task to a table-filling problem wherein an
additional expensive decoding step involving beam search is applied to obtain

global optimization in the form of CRFs with Viterbi decoding for the NER

neural architecture utilizing the table structure, based on repeated
applications of 2D convolutions for pooling local dependency and metric-based
features, that improves on the state-of-the-art without the need for global
optimization. We validate our model on the ADE and CoNLL04 datasets for

after their typical radial velocities. The -3 km/s cloud is the main
filamentary cloud (31,000 Mo) associated with young massive stars such as DR21
and DR21(OH), and the 9 km/s cloud is a smaller cloud (3,400 Mo) which may be
an extension of the W75 region in the north. The other clouds are much smaller.
We found a clear anticorrelation in the distributions of the -3 and 9 km/s
clouds, and detected faint 12CO emission having intermediate velocities
bridging the two clouds at their intersection. These facts strongly indicate
that the two clouds are colliding against each other. In addition, we found
that DR21 and DR21(OH) are located in the periphery of the densest part of the
9 km/s cloud, which is consistent with results of recent numerical simulations
of cloud-cloud collisions. We therefore suggest that the -3 and 9 km/s clouds
are colliding, and that the collision induced the massive star formation in the
DR21 cloud. The interaction of the -3 and 9 km/s clouds was previously
suggested by Dickel et al. (1978), and our results strongly support their
hypothesis of the interaction.

  Bias",,,,,"cs.LG math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) is a popular method for
learning in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that saves computation and memory
at the cost of bias by truncating backpropagation after a fixed number of lags.
In practice, choosing the optimal truncation length is difficult: TBPTT will
not converge if the truncation length is too small, or will converge slowly if
it is too large. We propose an adaptive TBPTT scheme that converts the problem
from choosing a temporal lag to one of choosing a tolerable amount of gradient
bias. For many realistic RNNs, the TBPTT gradients decay geometrically in
expectation for large lags; under this condition, we can control the bias by
varying the truncation length adaptively. For RNNs with smooth activation
functions, we prove that this bias controls the convergence rate of SGD with
biased gradients for our non-convex loss. Using this theory, we develop a
practical method for adaptively estimating the truncation length during
training. We evaluate our adaptive TBPTT method on synthetic data and language
modeling tasks and find that our adaptive TBPTT ameliorates the computational
pitfalls of fixed TBPTT.

intersection angle directly relates to the base-high ratio and texture
distortion in the parallax direction, thus both affecting the horizontal and

different accuracy as compared to the ground truth LiDAR data. This raises a
very practical question that is often asked by practitioners: what factors
constitute a good satellite stereo pair, such that it produces accurate and
optimal results for mapping purpose? In this work, we provide a comprehensive
analysis on this matter by performing stereo matching over 1,000 satellite

via compressive sensing and machine learning to perform inference tasks

a multi-dimensional or tensorial format, with each dimension or tensor mode
representing different features such as the spatial and temporal information in
video sequences or the spatial and spectral information in hyperspectral
images. However, in existing compressive learning frameworks, the compressive
sensing component utilizes either random or learned linear projection on the
vectorized signal to perform signal acquisition, thus discarding the
multi-dimensional structure of the signals. In this paper, we propose
Multilinear Compressive Learning, a framework that takes into account the
tensorial nature of multi-dimensional signals in the acquisition step and
builds the subsequent inference model on the structurally sensed measurements.
Our theoretical complexity analysis shows that the proposed framework is more
efficient compared to its vector-based counterpart in both memory and
computation requirement. With extensive experiments, we also empirically show
that our Multilinear Compressive Learning framework outperforms the
vector-based framework in object classification and face recognition tasks, and
scales favorably when the dimensionalities of the original signals increase,
making it highly efficient for high-dimensional multi-dimensional signals.

APT can modify the posterior estimate using arbitrary, dynamically updated

quantification of this uncertainty. Unfortunately, existing methods for
Bayesian inference in GLMs require running times roughly cubic in parameter
dimension, and so are limited to settings with at most tens of thousand

Laplace approximation or Markov chain Monte Carlo, LR-GLM provides a full
Bayesian posterior approximation and admits running times reduced by a full

estimating the genetic and environmental covariance functions of functional

development of a novel estimator ensuring positive semidefiniteness. Simulation

to a loss of the content within views, and the spatial relationship among
views, which limits the discriminability of learned features. We propose
3DViewGraph to resolve this issue, which learns 3D global features by more
effectively aggregating unordered views with attention. Specifically, unordered
views taken around a shape are regarded as view nodes on a view graph.
3DViewGraph first learns a novel latent semantic mapping to project low-level
view features into meaningful latent semantic embeddings in a lower dimensional
space, which is spanned by latent semantic patterns. Then, the content and
spatial information of each pair of view nodes are encoded by a novel spatial
pattern correlation, where the correlation is computed among latent semantic
patterns. Finally, all spatial pattern correlations are integrated with
attention weights learned by a novel attention mechanism. This further
increases the discriminability of learned features by highlighting the
unordered view nodes with distinctive characteristics and depressing the ones
with appearance ambiguity. We show that 3DViewGraph outperforms

sequence of manipulation actions that displace multiple objects from an initial
configuration to a given goal configuration. Rearrangement is a critical skill
for robots so that they can effectively operate in confined spaces that contain
clutter. Examples of tasks that require rearrangement include packing objects
inside a bin, wherein objects need to lay according to a predefined pattern. In
tight bins, collision-free grasps are often unavailable. Nonprehensile actions,
such as pushing and sliding, are preferred because they can be performed using
minimalistic end-effectors that can easily be inserted in the bin.
Rearrangement with nonprehensile actions is a challenging problem as it
requires reasoning about object interactions in a combinatorially large
configuration space of multiple objects. This work revisits several existing
rearrangement planning techniques and introduces a new one that exploits nested
nonprehensile actions by pushing several similar objects simultaneously along
the same path, which removes the need to rearrange each object individually.
Experiments in simulation and using a real Kuka robotic arm show the ability of
the proposed approach to solve difficult rearrangement tasks while reducing the

$\Phi$-generalized powers can be considered as a natural basis functions for
the one-dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics systems taking
$\Phi=\psi_0^2$, where the function $\psi_0(x)$ is the ground state wave
function of one of the supersymmetric scalar Hamiltonians. Several properties
are obtained such as $\Phi$-symmetric conjugate and antisymmetry of the
$\Phi$-generalized powers, a supersymmetric binomial identity for these
functions, a supersymmetric Pythagorean elliptic (hyperbolic) identity
involving four $\Phi$-trigonometric ($\Phi$-hyperbolic) functions as well as a
supersymmetric Taylor series expressed in terms of the $\Phi$-derivatives. We
show that the first $n$ $\Phi$-generalized powers are a fundamental set of
solutions associated with a nonconstant coefficients homogeneous linear
ordinary differential equations of order $n+1$. Finally, we present a general
solution representation of the stationary Schr\""odinger equation in terms of

regression method SpaRTA (Sparse Regression of Turbulent Stress Anisotropy) is
introduced to infer algebraic stress models for the closure of RANS equations
directly from high-fidelity LES or DNS data. The models are written as tensor
polynomials and are built from a library of candidate functions. The
machine-learning method is based on elastic net regularisation which promotes
sparsity of the inferred models. By being data-driven the method relaxes
assumptions commonly made in the process of model development. Model-discovery
and cross-validation is performed for three cases of separating flows, i.e.
periodic hills ($Re$=10595), converging-diverging channel ($Re$=12600) and
curved backward-facing step ($Re$=13700). The predictions of the discovered
models are significantly improved over the $k$-$\omega$ SST also for a true
prediction of the flow over periodic hills at $Re$=37000. This study shows a
systematic assessment of SpaRTA for rapid machine-learning of robust
corrections for standard RANS turbulence models.

alternative to SRAM in the memory hierarchy due to STT-RAM's non-volatility,
low leakage power, high density, and fast read speed. The STT-RAM's small
feature size is particularly desirable for the last-level cache (LLC), which
typically consumes a large area of silicon die. However, long write latency and
high write energy still remain challenges of implementing STT-RAMs in the CPU
cache. An increasingly popular method for addressing this challenge involves
trading off the non-volatility for reduced write speed and write energy by
relaxing the STT-RAM's data retention time. However, in order to maximize
energy saving potential, the cache configurations, including STT-RAM's
retention time, must be dynamically adapted to executing applications' variable
memory needs. In this paper, we propose a highly adaptable last level STT-RAM
cache (HALLS) that allows the LLC configurations and retention time to be
adapted to applications' runtime execution requirements. We also propose
low-overhead runtime tuning algorithms to dynamically determine the best
(lowest energy) cache configurations and retention times for executing
applications. Compared to prior work, HALLS reduced the average energy
consumption by 60.57% in a quad-core system, while introducing marginal latency
overhead.

predictor-corrector adaptivity applied to anisotropic phase-field brittle
fracture. The phase-field formulation is used to resolve the sharp crack
surface topology on the anisotropic/non-uniform local state in the regularized
concept. To resolve the crack phase-field by a given single preferred
direction, second-order structural tensors are imposed to both the bulk and
crack surface density functions. Accordingly, a split in tension and
compression modes in anisotropic materials is considered. A Global-Local
formulation is proposed, in which the full displacement/phase-field problem is
solved on a lower (local) scale, while dealing with a purely linear elastic
problem on an upper (global) scale. Robin-type boundary conditions are
introduced to relax the stiff local response at the global scale and enhancing
its stabilization. Another important aspect of this contribution is the
development of an adaptive Global-Local approach, where a predictor-corrector
scheme is designed in which the local domains are dynamically updated during
the computation. To cope with different finite element discretizations at the
interface between the two nested scales, a non-matching dual mortar method is
formulated. Hence, more regularity is achieved on the interface. Several
numerical results substantiate our developments.

capillary number, as previously observed, but also are a function of the

conclusion suggesting that capillary number and viscosity ratio alone cannot

displacement is considered, where the displacements are accompanied by sudden
interface jumps from one site to another, known as Haines jumps. The
characteristic time and length scales of a Haines jump are examined to better
understand the transient dynamics of the jump. We then focus on analyzing the

distribution is optimized to have a high expectation of the performance.
Besides, a hypothesis that the performance ranking is consistent in every

whether there exists a distribution $p$ for which $\lambda(\mathcal{A},p)< 0$,
i.e. it is NP-hard to decide whether this dynamical system can be stabilized.
  This hardness result holds even in the ""simple""' case where $\mathcal{A}$
contains only rank-one matrices. Somewhat surprisingly, this is in stark
contrast to the Joint Spectral Radius -- the deterministic kindred of the
Lyapunov exponent -- for which the analogous optimization problem for rank-one
matrices is known to be exactly computable in polynomial time.
  To prove this hardness result, we first observe via Birkhoff's Ergodic
Theorem that the Lyapunov exponent of rank-one matrices admits a simple formula
and in fact is a quadratic form in $p$. Hardness of the design problem is shown
through a reduction from the Independent Set problem. Along the way, simple
examples are given illustrating that $p \mapsto \lambda(\mathcal{A},p)$ is
neither convex nor concave in general. We conclude with extensions to
continuous distributions, exchangeable processes, Markov processes, and
stationary ergodic processes.

global concern. Hence, the need for an effective weather risk management tool
(i.e., weather derivatives) that can hedge crop yields against weather
uncertainties. However, most smallholder farmers and agricultural stakeholders
are unwilling to pay for the price of weather derivatives (WD) because of the
presence of basis risks (product-design and geographical) in the pricing
models. To eliminate product-design basis risks, a machine learning ensemble
technique was used to determine the relationship between maize yield and
weather variables. The results revealed that the most significant weather
variable that affected the yield of maize was average temperature. A
mean-reverting model with a time-varying speed of mean reversion, seasonal
mean, and local volatility that depended on the local average temperature was
then proposed. The model was extended to a multi-dimensional model for
different but correlated locations. Based on these average temperature models,
pricing models for futures, options on futures, and basket futures for
cumulative average temperature and growing degree-days are presented. Pricing
futures on baskets reduces geographical basis risk, as buyers have the
opportunity to select the most appropriate weather stations with their desired
weight preference. With these pricing models, farmers and agricultural
stakeholders can hedge their crops against the perils of extreme weather.

quality assurance methodology for real-world cyber-physical systems. In
falsification, one employs stochastic hill-climbing optimization to quickly
find a counterexample input to a black-box system model. Quantitative robust
semantics is the technical key that enables use of such optimization. In this
paper, we tackle the so-called scale problem regarding Boolean connectives that
is widely recognized in the community: quantities of different scales (such as
speed [km/h] vs. RPM, or worse, RPH) can mask each other's contribution to
robustness. Our solution consists of integration of the multi-armed bandit
algorithms in hill climbing-guided falsification frameworks, with a technical
novelty of a new reward notion that we call hill-climbing gain. Our experiments
show our approach's robustness under the change of scales, and that it
outperforms a state-of-the-art falsification tool.

programs with the weight scheme adapted from Markov Logic. Because of the
semantic differences, strong equivalence for ASP does not simply carry over to
$\rm LP^{MLN}$. I study the concept of strong equivalence in $\rm LP^{MLN}$
with the goal of extending strong equivalence to $\rm LP^{MLN}$ programs. My
study shows that the verification of strong equivalence in $\rm LP^{MLN}$ can
be reduced to equivalence checking in classical logic plus weight
consideration.The result allows us to leverage an answer set solver for
checking strong equivalence in $\rm LP^{MLN}$. Furthermore, this study also
suggests us a few reformulations of the $\rm LP^{MLN}$ semantics using choice
rules, logic of here and there, and the second-order logic. I will present my
work result of strong equivalence for $\rm LP^{MLN}$ and talk about my next

expressly erased. We split each of these cluster samples into two using the
average cluster-centric distance of the member galaxies to measure the

differences in clustering strength, even in the catalog where the true assembly

regression outputs have to be predicted jointly. We consider several extensions
of gradient boosting to address such problems. We first propose a
straightforward adaptation of gradient boosting exploiting multiple output
regression trees as base learners. We then argue that this method is only
expected to be optimal when the outputs are fully correlated, as it forces the
partitioning induced by the tree base learners to be shared by all outputs. We
then propose a novel extension of gradient tree boosting to specifically
address this issue. At each iteration of this new method, a regression tree
structure is grown to fit a single random projection of the current residuals
and the predictions of this tree are fitted linearly to the current residuals
of all the outputs, independently. Because of this linear fit, the method can
adapt automatically to any output correlation structure. Extensive experiments
are conducted with this method, as well as other algorithmic variants, on
several artificial and real problems. Randomly projecting the output space is
shown to provide a better adaptation to different output correlation patterns
and is therefore competitive with the best of the other methods in most
settings. Thanks to model sharing, the convergence speed is also improved,
reducing the computing times (or the complexity of the model) to reach a
specific accuracy.

structure is in its ground state (the lowest, most stable state, usually
crystalline). This is no longer the case as soon as the structure is distorted
in any way. Examples of simulated distortions (or ``defects'') are: angular or
linear bond alteration, insertion of free radicals near the main structure,
dangling bonds; their cumulative effects lead to the amorphous state. It is
shown that, in this state, a structure bears a majority of weak transitions and
a minority of strong ones. As the structure grows in size, the former
ultimately form a weak continuum already detected experimentally, in the
visible, on amorphous carbons and silicates. The stronger transitions will
manage to emerge above the continuum, especially when they bunch together by
chance near the same wavelength. Parallels are drawn between several properties

approaches which use a fixed rank for all features, this paper proposes a
Rank-Aware FM (RaFM) model which adopts pairwise interactions from embeddings
with different ranks. The proposed model achieves a better performance on
real-world datasets where different features have significantly varying
frequencies of occurrences. Moreover, we prove that the RaFM model can be
stored, evaluated, and trained as efficiently as one single FM, and under some
reasonable conditions it can be even significantly more efficient than FM. RaFM
improves the performance of FMs in both regression tasks and classification
tasks while incurring less computational burden, therefore also has attractive
potential in industrial applications.

remnants (SNRs), produced in diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) process in
supernova blast waves driven by expanding SNRs. One of the key unsettled issue
in SNR origin of cosmic ray model is the maximum attainable energy by a cosmic
ray particle in the supernova shock. Recently it has been suggested that an
amplification of effective magnetic field strength at the shock may take place
in young SNRs due to growth of magnetic waves induced by accelerated cosmic
rays and as a result the maximum energy achieved by cosmic rays in SNR may
reach the knee energy instead of $\sim 200$ TeV as predicted earlier under
normal magnetic field situation. In the present work we investigate the
implication of such maximum energy scenarios on TeV gamma rays and neutrino
fluxes from the molecular clouds interacting with the SNR W28. The authors
compute the gamma-ray and neutrino flux assuming two different values for the
maximum energy reached by cosmic rays in the SNR, from CR interaction in nearby
molecular clouds. Both protons and nuclei are considered as accelerated
particles and as target material. Our findings suggest that the issue of the
maximum energy of cosmic rays in SNRs can be observationally settled by the
upcoming gamma-ray experiment the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory
(LHAASO). The estimated neutrino fluxes from the molecular clouds are ,
however, out of reach of the present/near future generation of neutrino
telescopes.

orbital-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy, we detect the ultrafast dynamics
of electronic nematicity. In the strong-excitation regime, through the
observation of Fermi surface anisotropy, we find a quick disappearance of the
nematicity followed by a heavily-damped oscillation. This short-life nematicity

evaluate the holographic complexity in some multiple-horzion black holes for

Motivated by the vanishing result of the purely magnetic black hole founded by
Goto $et.\, al$, we investigate the complexity in a static charged black hole
with source-free electrodynamics and find that this vanishing feature of the
late-time rate is universal for a purely static magnetic black hole. However,
this result shows some unexpected features of the late-time growth rate. We
show how the inclusion of a boundary term for the first-order electromagnetic
field to the total action can make the holographic complexity be well-defined
and obtain a general expression of the late-time complexity growth rate with
these boundary terms. We apply our late-time result to some explicit cases and
show how to choose the proportional constant of these additional boundary terms
to make the complexity be well-defined in the zero-charge limit. For the static
magnetic black hole in Einstein gravity coupled to a first-order
electrodynamics, we find that there is a general relationship between the
proper proportional constant and the Lagrangian function $h(\math{F})$ of the
electromagnetic field: if $h(\math{F})$ is a convergent function, the choice of
the proportional constant is independent on explicit expressions of
$h(\math{F})$ and it should be chosen as $4/3$; if $h(\math{F})$ is a divergent
function, the proportional constant is dependent on the asymptotic index of the

(independent of the physical parameters of the system), i.e., can converge in
the norm of any $L^\gamma\cap H_0^1$ as the corresponding initial values
converge in $L^2$. Applying this to the global attractor we find that, with
external forcing only in $ L^2$, the attractor $\mathscr{A}$ attracts bounded
subsets of $L^2$ in the norm of any $L^\gamma\cap H_0^1$, and that every
translation set $\mathscr{A}-z_0$ of $\mathscr{A}$ for any $z_0 \in

Artin-Tougeron type result in the sense that approximation of order 2k ensures
exact solutions agreeing up to order k with the approximation [13], [22].
Alternatively, it may be interpreted as Hensel's Lemma in Banach spaces. In the
spirit of [9] and [18], the required surjectivity condition is interpreted as a
direct sum condition of order k that allows for solving the remainder equation
with respect to graded subspaces derived from an appropriate filtration [24],
[25]. In the direction of these subspaces, the determinant can be calculated in
a finite dimensional setting, enabling the investigation of secondary global
bifurcation phenomena by sign change of Brouwer's degree [18]. The direct sum
condition seems to be a generalization of the direct sum condition introduced
in [9]. The implicit function theorem delivers stability of k leading
coefficients with respect to perturbations of order 2k+1 and uniqueness in
pointed wedges around the solution curves. Further, a lower bound of the
Greenberg function of a singularity is constructed by use of a step function
obtained from k-degrees. Finally, based on Kouchnirenko's theorem [17], the
results are applied to Newton-polygons where it is shown that the Milnor number
of a singularity can be calculated by the sum of k-degrees of corresponding
solution curves. Simple ADE-singularities are investigated in detail. The main
theorem represents a version of strong implicit function theorem in Banach
spaces, possibly comparable to theorems in [2]. Moreover, our aim is to extend
the direct sum condition of order k from [9] to certain topics in singularity
and approximation theory.

be linear. In the 1950s, a mistake in FN's thinking was found. Corrected theory
by Murphy and Good (MG) made theoretical FN plots slightly curved. This causes
difficulties when attempting to extract precise values of emission
characterization parameters from straight lines fitted to experimental FN
plots. Improved mathematical understanding, from 2006 onwards, has now enabled
a new FE data-plot form, the ""Murphy-Good plot"". This plots
ln{Im/(Vm)**(2-({\eta}/6)} vs 1/Vm, where {\eta} depends only on local work

of purely quantum effects on a macroscopic level. The vast majority of BECs
achieved in the lab to date consist of bosonic atoms, which macroscopically
populate the ground state once a threshold temperature has been reached.
Recently, a new type of condensate was observed - the photon BEC, where light
in a dye-filled cavity thermalises with dye molecules under the influence of an
external driving laser, condensing to the lowest-energy mode. However, the
precise relationship between the photon BEC and symmetry-breaking phenomena has
not yet been investigated. Here we consider medium-induced symmetry breaking in
a photon BEC and show that it can be used as a quantum sensor. The introduction
of polarisable objects such as chiral molecules lifts the degeneracy between
cavity modes of different polarisations. Even a tiny imbalance is imprinted on
the condensate polarisation in a 'winner takes it all' effect. When used as a
sensor for enantiomeric excess, the predicted sensitivity exceeds that of
contemporary methods based on circular dichroism. Our results introduce a new

two-point sum rule method. In computations we take into account contributions
arising from various quark, gluon and mixed vacuum condensates up to dimension
10. The central value of the mass $m=(7105 \pm 155)~\mathrm{ MeV}$ lies below
the thresholds for the strong and electromagnetic decays of $T_{bc}^{0}$ state,
and hence it transforms to conventional mesons only through the weak decays. In
the case of $m=7260~\mathrm{MeV}$ the tetraquark $T_{bc}^{0}$ becomes the
strong- and electromagnetic-interaction unstable particle. In the first case,
we find the full width and mean lifetime of $ T_{bc}^{0}$ using its dominant
semileptonic decays $T_{bc}^{0}\to T_{cc;\bar{ u}\bar{d}}^{+}l\overline{\nu

We compute also partial widths of the nonleptonic weak decays $T_{bc}^{0}\to
T_{cc;\bar{u}\bar{d} }^{+}\pi^{-}(K^{-}, D^{-}, D_{s}^{-})$, and take into
account their effects on the full width of $T_{bc}^{0}$. In the context of the
second scenario we calculate partial widths of $S$-wave strong decays
$T_{bc}^{0}\to B^{\ast -}D^{+}$ and $T_{bc}^{0}\to \overline{B}^{\ast 0}D^{0}$,
and using these channels evaluate the full width of $T_{bc}^{0}$. Predictions

significantly from that of random networks. From a network science standpoint,
non-random structural patterns observed in real networks call for an
explanation of their emergence and an understanding of their potential systemic
consequences. This article focuses on one of these patterns: nestedness. Given
a network of interacting nodes, nestedness can be described as the tendency for
nodes to interact with subsets of the interaction partners of better-connected
nodes. Known since more than $80$ years in biogeography, nestedness has been
found in systems as diverse as ecological mutualistic organizations, world
trade, inter-organizational relations, among many others. This review article
focuses on three main pillars: the existing methodologies to observe nestedness
in networks; the main theoretical mechanisms conceived to explain the emergence
of nestedness in ecological and socio-economic networks; the implications of a
nested topology of interactions for the stability and feasibility of a given
interacting system. We survey results from variegated disciplines, including
statistical physics, graph theory, ecology, and theoretical economics.
Nestedness was found to emerge both in bipartite networks and, more recently,
in unipartite ones; this review is the first comprehensive attempt to unify
both streams of studies, usually disconnected from each other. We believe that
the truly interdisciplinary endeavour -- while rooted in a complex systems
perspective -- may inspire new models and algorithms whose realm of application
will undoubtedly transcend disciplinary boundaries.

attracted increasing research interests, among which the gossip protocols

bounds of the differential privacy guarantees are derived for gossip protocols
in general networks in both synchronous and asynchronous settings. The
prediction uncertainty of the source node given a uniform prior is also
determined. For the private gossip algorithm, the differential privacy and
prediction uncertainty guarantees are derived in closed form. Moreover,
considering that these two metrics may be restrictive in some scenarios, the
relaxed variants are proposed. It is found that source anonymity is closely
related to some key network structure parameters in the general network

unreliable communications, and quantify the tradeoff between differential
privacy guarantees and information spreading efficiency. Finally, considering
that the attacker may not be present at the beginning of the information

thermodynamics of charge separation process in organic solar cells (OSCs).
Using the theory of stochastic thermodynamics, we connect the phonon-assisted
dynamics and recombination of electron-hole pairs within a photo-excited
organic bilayer with the thermodynamic free energy. We analyze the impact of
energetic disorder and delocalization on the free energy, average energy and
entropy. For high energetic disorder, the site population is well described by
equilibrium. We observe significant deviations from equilibrium for delocalized
electron-hole pairs at small energetic disorder, representing efficient OSCs.
Our results emphasize that both a large Gibbs entropy and large initial
separation are required to achieve efficient charge separation. A decrease in
free energy barrier with increased distances between charges does not
necessarily correlate with the separation yield. Our presented framework can
further shed light on the transient thermodynamic free energy, allowing
previously inaccessible insight into the individual thermodynamic contributions
from energy and entropy on sub-ns timescales. Transient simulations reveal
large Gibbs entropy on ps-timescales for even highest disorder, which may
explain the efficient separation of ""hot"" CT states.

initially entangled state, the environment washes out the initial entanglement
after a finite interval of time. We also show that the movement of the qubits
can play a constructive role in protecting of the initial entanglement. In this
case, we observe a Zeno-like effect due to the velocity of the qubits. On the
other hand, by limiting the number of qubits initially in a superposition of
single excitation, a stationary entanglement can be achieved between the qubits
initially in the excited and ground states. Surprisingly, we illustrate that
when the velocity of all qubits are the same, the stationary state of the
qubits does not depend on this velocity as well as the environmental
properties. This allows us to determine the stationary distribution of the
entanglement versus the total number of qubits in the system.

preserved as long as power is turned on and refresh operation is not required
for the SRAM cell. SRAM is widely used for on-chip cache memory in
microprocessors, game software, computers, workstations, portable handheld
devices due to high data speed, low power consumption, low voltage supply,
no-refresh needed. Therefore, to build a reliable cache/memory, the individual
cell (SRAM) must be designed to have high Static Noise Margin (SNM). In
sub-threshold region, conventional 6T-cell SRAM experiences poor read and write
ability, and reduction in the SNM at various fluctuation of the threshold
voltage, supply voltage down scaling, and technology scaling in nano-meter
ranges (180nm, 90nm, 45nm, 22nm, 16nm and 10nm). Thus, noise margin becomes
worse during read and write operations compared to hold operation which the
internal feedback operates independent of the access transistors. Due to these
limitations of the conventional 6T SRAM cell, we have proposed a 9T SRAM that
will drastically minimize these limitations; the extra three transistors added
to the 6T topology will improve the read, hold and write SNM. The design and
simulation results were carried out using Cadence Virtuoso to evaluate the

while preserving the acceptance of the storage ring, the IMS with two
Time-Of-Flight (TOF) detectors has been implemented at the storage ring CSRe in
Lanzhou, China. Additional velocity information beside the revolution time in
the ring can be obtained for each of the stored ions by using the double TOF
detector system. In this paper, we introduced a new method of using a 658 nm
laser range finder and a short-pulsed ultra-violet laser to directly measure
the distance and time delay difference between the two TOF detectors which were
installed inside the $10^{-11}$ mbar vacuum chambers. The results showed that
the distance between the two ultra-thin carbon foils of the two TOF detectors
was ranging from 18032.5 mm to 18035.0 mm over a measurable area of
20$\times$20 mm$^2$.
  Given the measured distance, the time delay difference which comes with
signal cable length difference between the two TOF detectors was measured to be
$\Delta t_{delay1-2}=99$(26) ps. The new method has enabled us to use the speed
of light in vacuum to calibrate the velocity of stored ions in the ring. The
velocity resolution of the current double TOF detector system at CSRe was
deduced to be $\sigma(v)/v=4.4\times 10^{-4}$ for laser light, mainly limited
by the time resolution of the TOF detectors.

shown promise in identifying novel patterns and relations from EHRs without
using human created labels. In this paper, we investigate the application of
unsupervised machine learning models in discovering latent disease clusters and
patient subgroups based on EHRs. We utilized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA),
a generative probabilistic model, and proposed a novel model named Poisson
Dirichlet Model (PDM), which extends the LDA approach using a Poisson
distribution to model patients' disease diagnoses and to alleviate age and sex
factors by considering both observed and expected observations. In the
empirical experiments, we evaluated LDA and PDM on three patient cohorts with
EHR data retrieved from the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), for the
discovery of latent disease clusters and patient subgroups. We compared the
effectiveness of LDA and PDM in identifying latent disease clusters through the
visualization of disease representations learned by two approaches. We also
tested the performance of LDA and PDM in differentiating patient subgroups
through survival analysis, as well as statistical analysis. The experimental
results show that the proposed PDM could effectively identify distinguished
disease clusters by alleviating the impact of age and sex, and that LDA could
stratify patients into more differentiable subgroups than PDM in terms of
p-values. However, the subgroups discovered by PDM might imply the underlying
patterns of diseases of greater interest in epidemiology research due to the
alleviation of age and sex. Both unsupervised machine learning approaches could
be leveraged to discover patient subgroups using EHRs but with different foci.

ongoing debate about which indicators should be used to measure innovation.
Recent approaches have favoured the use of composite innovation indicators.
However, there is no consensus about the appropriate methodology to aggregate
the varying dimensions of innovation into a single summary indicator. One of
the best known examples of composite innovation indicators is the European
Innovation Scoreboard (EIS). It is a relevant tool for benchmarking innovation
in Europe. Still, the EIS lacks a proper scheme for weighting the included

an appraisal methodology permitting to take into consideration the interaction
of criteria and robustness concerns related to the elicitation of the weights
assigned to the elementary indicators. With this aim, we apply the
hierarchical-SMAA-Choquet integral approach. This integrated multicriteria
decision making (MCDM) method helps the users to rank and benchmark countries'
innovation performance taking into account the importance and interaction of
criteria assigned by themselves, rather than equal weights or weights

embedding space, allowing the user to query using a representation of the item
(like a tune for a song, or a picture for an object). However, this approach
requires the user to possess an example representation of their desired item.
Additionally, most current search systems do not allow the user to dynamically
adapt the results with further feedback. On the other hand, users often have a
mental picture of the desired item and are able to answer ordinal questions of
the form: ""Is this item similar to what you have in mind?"" With this
assumption, our algorithm allows for users to provide sequential feedback on
search results to adapt the search feed. We show that our proposed approach
works well both qualitatively and quantitatively. Unlike most previous
representation-based search systems, we can quantify the quality of our

important for downstream tasks such as classification. Even recent models,
which aim to improve the quality of these token-level topic assignments, have

  Since human evaluation is expensive we propose a variety of automated metrics
to evaluate topic models at a local level. Finally, we correlate our proposed
metrics with human judgments from the task on several datasets. We show that an
evaluation based on the percent of topic switches correlates most strongly with

operational metrics of multiplexing gain and probability of blocking to assess
the operation of multi-service multi-user battery. To address the computational

an analytical solution. We then provide an empirical analysis based on real
grid congestion data from RTE France, and a large dataset of end-users'
electricity consumption in California. Our empirical analysis shows (i) our
proposed effective capacity is a close approximation, (ii) battery operation
and profit are sensitive to the cost of external resources, number of
end-users, and RTE's leasing price of the battery, and (iii) with only a slight
discount of the leasing price, the profit of the third party from a stochastic
residual battery can be the same as that of a deterministic one. Cloud storage
as a low priority service can profitably exist alongside other high priority
