have been developed and successfully applied. However, in some cases, these
models might be restrictive on the possible solutions or their solutions might
be difficult to interpret. To overcome this problem, we outline a new approach,
the so-called allagmatic method, that automatically programs and executes
models with as little limitations as possible while maintaining human
interpretability. Earlier we described a metamodel and its building blocks
according to the philosophical concepts of structure (spatial dimension) and
operation (temporal dimension). They are entity, milieu, and update function
that together abstractly describe cellular automata, artificial neural
networks, and possibly any kind of computer model. By automatically combining
these building blocks in an evolutionary computation, interpretability might be
increased by the relationship to the metamodel, and models might be translated
into more interpretable models via the metamodel. We propose generic and
object-oriented programming to implement the entities and their milieus as
dynamic and generic arrays and the update function as a method. We show two
experiments where a simple cellular automaton and an artificial neural network
are automatically programmed, compiled, and executed. A target state is
successfully evolved and learned in the cellular automaton and artificial
neural network, respectively. We conclude that the allagmatic method can create
and execute cellular automaton and artificial neural network models in an
automated manner with the guidance of philosophy.

distinguish genuine tail properties in a very strong sense. Specifically, we
introduce the class of max-functionals, which contains key characteristics from
extreme value theory, for instance the extreme value index. We show that its
members fail to be elicitable and that their elicitation complexity is in fact
infinite under mild regularity assumptions. Further we prove that, even if the
information of a max-functional is reported via the entire distribution
function, a proper scoring rule cannot separate max-functional values. These
findings highlight the caution needed in forecast evaluation and statistical
inference if relevant information is encoded by such functionals.

increasing interest in robotics research as it improves the robots
environmental adaptability, locomotion versatility, and operational

of hybrid robots stems from their multiple (two or more) locomotion modes,
among which robots can select from depending on the encountering terrain
conditions. However, there are many challenges in improving the autonomy of the
locomotion mode transition between their multiple locomotion modes. This work
proposed a method to realize an autonomous locomotion mode transition of a
track-legged quadruped robot steps negotiation. The autonomy of the
decision-making process was realized by the proposed criterion to comparing
energy performances of the rolling and walking locomotion modes. Two climbing
gaits were proposed to achieve smooth steps negotiation behaviours for energy
evaluation purposes. Simulations showed autonomous locomotion mode transitions
were realized for negotiations of steps with different height. The proposed
method is generic enough to be utilized to other hybrid robots after some
pre-studies of their locomotion energy performances.

points in terms of real fields can be analytically continued to complex saddles

to determine the middle-dimensional steepest-descent surface in the complex
field space, constructed from Lefschetz thimbles, on which the path integral is
to be performed. As an alternative to extracting the decay rate from the
imaginary part of the ground-state energy of the false vacuum, we use the
optical theorem in order to derive it from the real-time amplitude for forward

continuation of its Euclidean counterpart, we work out in detail how it can be
computed to one-loop order at the level of the path integral, i.e. evaluating
the Gau{\ss}ian integrals of fluctuations about the relevant complex saddle
points. To that effect, we show how the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions on a
thimble can be obtained by analytic continuation of the Euclidean eigensystem,

the left absorption probabilities $P_n^{(1)}(1,0)$ related to the finite

  Black-box Model",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Interpretable machine learning has become a strong competitor for traditional
black-box models. However, the possible loss of the predictive performance for
gaining interpretability is often inevitable, putting practitioners in a
dilemma of choosing between high accuracy (black-box models) and
interpretability (interpretable models). In this work, we propose a novel
framework for building a Hybrid Predictive Model (HPM) that integrates an
interpretable model with any black-box model to combine their strengths. The
interpretable model substitutes the black-box model on a subset of data where
the black-box is overkill or nearly overkill, gaining transparency at no or low
cost of the predictive accuracy. We design a principled objective function that
considers predictive accuracy, model interpretability, and model transparency
(defined as the percentage of data processed by the interpretable substitute.)
Under this framework, we propose two hybrid models, one substituting with
association rules and the other with linear models, and we design customized
training algorithms for both models. We test the hybrid models on structured
data and text data where interpretable models collaborate with various
state-of-the-art black-box models. Results show that hybrid models obtain an
efficient trade-off between transparency and predictive performance,
characterized by our proposed efficient frontiers.

in the computer vision, natural language processing, speech synthesis and
similar domains. Arguably the most striking results have been in the area of
image synthesis. However, evaluating the performance of GANs is still an open
and challenging problem. Existing evaluation metrics primarily measure the
dissimilarity between real and generated images using automated statistical
methods. They often require large sample sizes for evaluation and do not
directly reflect human perception of image quality. In this work, we describe
an evaluation metric we call Neuroscore, for evaluating the performance of
GANs, that more directly reflects psychoperceptual image quality through the
utilization of brain signals. Our results show that Neuroscore has superior
performance to the current evaluation metrics in that: (1) It is more
consistent with human judgment; (2) The evaluation process needs much smaller
numbers of samples; and (3) It is able to rank the quality of images on a per
GAN basis. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based neuro-AI interface is
proposed to predict Neuroscore from GAN-generated images directly without the
need for neural responses. Importantly, we show that including neural responses
during the training phase of the network can significantly improve the
prediction capability of the proposed model. Materials related to this work are

segmentation. At the initial stage, the images are classified into the two
categories of normal and abnormal. Since the Deep Neural Networks have
performed successfully in machine vision task, we would employ the
convolutional neural networks for the classification of images. In the second
stage, the suggested framework is to diagnose and segment the tumor in the
mammography images. First, the mammography images are pre-processed by removing
noise and artifacts, and then, segment the image using the level-set algorithm
based on the spatial fuzzy c-means clustering. The proper initialization and
optimal configuration have strong effects on the performance of the level-set
segmentation. Thus, in our suggested framework, we have improved the level-set
algorithm by utilizing the spatial fuzzy c-means clustering which ultimately
results in a more precise segmentation. In order to evaluate the proposed
approach, we conducted experiments using the Mammographic Image Analysis (MIAS)
dataset. The tests have shown that the convolutional neural networks could
achieve high accuracy in classification of images. Moreover, the improved
level-set segmentation method, along with the fuzzy c-means clustering, could
perfectly do the segmentation on the tumor area. The suggested method has
classified the images with the accuracy of 78% and the AUC of 69%, which, as
compared to the previous methods, is 2% more accurate and 6% better AUC; and
has been able to extract the tumor area in a more precise way.

the resulting tessellation matches some desired geometrical properties. Since
the model is analytically intractable, our main tool of analysis is stochastic

$b(n)$, which can be defined by a linear recurrence relation with polynomial
coefficients. Equivalently, the associated generating function $\sum_n b(n)t^n$
is D-finite. In this paper, we address a much refined enumeration problem,
where we record for every $r$ the number of faces of degree $r$. When these
degrees are bounded, we show that the associated generating function is given
as the constant term of a multivariate rational series, and thus is still
D-finite. We also provide detailed asymptotic estimates for the corresponding
numbers.
  The methods used earlier to count all plane bipolar orientations, regardless
of their face degrees, do not generalize easily to record face degrees.
Instead, we start from a recent bijection, due to Kenyon et al., that sends
bipolar orientations onto certain lattice walks confined to the first quadrant.
Due to this bijection, the study of bipolar orientations meets the study of
walks confined to a cone, which has been extremely active in the past 15 years.
Some of our proofs rely on recent developments in this field, while others are
purely bijective. Our asymptotic results also involve probabilistic arguments.

drug discovery, page ranking, and recommendation systems. When graph size
exceeds memory size, out-of-core graph processing is needed. For the widely
used external memory graph processing systems, accessing storage becomes the
bottleneck. We make the observation that nearly all graph algorithms have a
dynamically varying number of active vertices that must be processed in each
iteration. However, existing graph processing frameworks, such as GraphChi,
load the entire graph in each iteration even if a small fraction of the graph
is active. This limitation is due to the structure of the data storage used by
these systems. In this work, we propose to use a compressed sparse row (CSR)
based graph storage that is more amenable for selectively loading only a few
active vertices in each iteration. But CSR based systems suffers from random
update propagation to many target vertices. To solve this challenge, we propose
to use a multi-log update mechanism that logs updates separately, rather than
directly update the active edges in a graph. Our proposed multi-log system
maintains a separate log per each vertex interval. This separation enables us
to efficiently process each vertex interval by just loading the corresponding
log. Further, while accessing SSD pages with fewer active vertex data, we
reduce the read amplification due to the page granular accesses in SSD by
logging the active vertex data in the current iteration and efficiently reading
the log in the next iteration. Over the current state of the art out-of-core
graph processing framework, our PartitionedVC improves performance by up to
$17.84\times$, $1.19\times$, $1.65\times$, $1.38\times$, $3.15\times$, and

monotonously with the increasing pressure. By applying appropriate pressures,
the experimentally measured anomalous Hall conductivity, $\sigma_{xy}^A$, can
be efficiently controlled. Our theoretical study reveals that this finding can
be attributed to the shift of the spin--orbit-coupling-induced splitting bands
of Fe atoms. With loading compression, $\sigma_{xy}^A$ reaches its maximal
value when the Fermi level lies inside the splitting bands and then attenuates
when the splitting bands float above the Fermi level. Further compression leads
to a prominent suppression of the magnetic moment, which is another physical
cause of the decrease in $\sigma_{xy}^A$ at high pressure. These results
indicate that the application of pressure is an effective approach in
controlling the anomalous Hall conductivity of layered magnetic materials,
which elucidates the physical mechanism of the large intrinsic anomalous Hall
effect.

Comments are welcome",,,,"cs.LG cond-mat.dis-nn cs.IT math.IT stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sequence models assign probabilities to variable-length sequences such as
natural language texts. The ability of sequence models to capture temporal
dependence can be characterized by the temporal scaling of correlation and
mutual information. In this paper, we study the mutual information of recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) including long short-term memories and self-attention
networks such as Transformers. Through a combination of theoretical study of
linear RNNs and empirical study of nonlinear RNNs, we find their mutual
information decays exponentially in temporal distance. On the other hand,
Transformers can capture long-range mutual information more efficiently, making
them preferable in modeling sequences with slow power-law mutual information,
such as natural languages and stock prices. We discuss the connection of these
results with statistical mechanics. We also point out the non-uniformity
problem in many natural language datasets. We hope this work provides a new
perspective in understanding the expressive power of sequence models and shed
new light on improving the architecture of them.

subject to user-level differential privacy. Typically, the exponential
mechanism or report noisy max are the algorithms used to solve this problem.
However, these algorithms require querying the database for the count of each
domain element. We focus on the setting where the data domain is unknown, which
is different than the setting of frequent itemsets where an apriori type
algorithm can help prune the space of domain elements to query. We design
algorithms that ensures (approximate) $(\epsilon,\delta>0)$-differential
privacy and only needs access to the true top-$\bar{k}$ elements from the data
for any chosen $\bar{k} \geq k$. This is a highly desirable feature for making
differential privacy practical, since the algorithms require no knowledge of
the domain. We consider both the setting where a user's data can modify an
arbitrary number of counts by at most 1, i.e. unrestricted sensitivity, and the
setting where a user's data can modify at most some small, fixed number of
counts by at most 1, i.e. restricted sensitivity. Additionally, we provide a
pay-what-you-get privacy composition bound for our algorithms. That is, our
algorithms might return fewer than $k$ elements when the top-$k$ elements are
queried, but the overall privacy budget only decreases by the size of the

discovered thousands of planets outside the solar system. These observations
have given rise to an astonishingly detailed picture of the demographics of
short-period planets, but are incomplete at longer periods where both the
sensitivity of transit surveys and radial velocity signals plummet. Even more
glaring is that the spectra of planets discovered with these indirect methods
are either inaccessible (radial velocity detections) or only available for a
small subclass of transiting planets with thick, clear atmospheres. Direct
detection can be used to discover and characterize the atmospheres of planets
at intermediate and wide separations, including non-transiting exoplanets.
Today, a small number of exoplanets have been directly imaged, but they
represent only a rare class of young, self-luminous super-Jovian-mass objects
orbiting tens to hundreds of AU from their host stars. Atmospheric
characterization of planets in the <5 AU regime, where radial velocity (RV)
surveys have revealed an abundance of other worlds, is technically feasible
with 30-m class apertures in combination with an advanced AO system,
coronagraph, and suite of spectrometers and imagers. There is a vast range of

varies across the healthy adult population and is affected in several
neurodevelopmental disorders. It has been suggested that neuroanatomy places
limits on this capacity through a map architecture that creates competition for
cortical space. This suggestion has been supported by the finding that primary
visual (V1) gray matter volume (GMV) is positively associated with VSTM
capacity. However, evidence from neurodevelopmental disorders suggests that the
dorsal visual stream more broadly is vulnerable and atypical volumes of other
map-containing regions may therefore play a role. For example, Turner syndrome
is associated with concomitantly reduced volume of the right intraparietal
sulcus (IPS) and deficits in VSTM. As posterior IPS regions (IPS0-2) contains
topographic maps, together this suggests that posterior IPS volumes may also
associate with VSTM. In this study, we assessed VSTM using two tasks, as well
as a composite score, and used voxel-based morphometry of T1-weighted magnetic
resonance images to assess GMV in V1 and right IPS0-2 in 32 healthy young
adults (16 female). For comparison with previous work, we also assessed
associations between VSTM and voxel-wise GMV on a whole-brain basis. We found
that total brain volume (TBV) significantly correlated with VSTM, and that
correlations between VSTM and regional GMV were substantially reduced in
strength when controlling for TBV. In our whole-brain analysis, we found that
VSTM was associated with GMV of clusters centered around the right putamen and
left Rolandic operculum, though only when TBV was not controlled for. Our
results suggest that VSTM ability is unlikely to be accounted for by the volume
of an individual cortical region and may instead rely on distributed structural
properties.

essential in demonstrating practical quantum advantage in quantum computing,
simulation and sensing. Since dimensionality grows exponentially with the
number of qubits, the potential power of noisy intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ) devices over classical resources also stems from entangled states in
high dimensions. An important family of quantum protocols that can take
advantage of high-dimensional Hilbert space are classification tasks. These
include quantum machine learning algorithms, witnesses in quantum information
processing and certain decision problems. However, due to counter-intuitive
geometrical properties emergent in high dimensions, classification problems are
vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We demonstrate that the amount of
perturbation needed for an adversary to induce a misclassification scales
inversely with dimensionality. This is shown to be a fundamental feature
independent of the details of the classification protocol. Furthermore, this
leads to a trade-off between the security of the classification algorithm
against adversarial attacks and quantum advantages we expect for
high-dimensional problems. In fact, protection against these adversarial
attacks require extra resources that scale at least polynomially with the
Hilbert space dimension of the system, which can erase any significant quantum
advantage that we might expect from a quantum protocol. This has wide-ranging
implications in the use of both near-term and future quantum technologies for
classification.

Kepler-20e is even smaller (0.87 R[Earth]), and was the first exoplanet to earn
that distinction. Their masses, however, are too light to measure with current
instrumentation, and this has prevented their confirmation by the usual Doppler
technique that has been used so successfully to confirm many other larger
planets. To persuade themselves of the planetary nature of these tiny objects,
astronomers employed instead a statistical technique to ""validate"" them,
showing that the likelihood they are planets is orders of magnitude larger than
a false positive. Kepler-20e and 20f orbit their Sun-like star every 6.1 and
19.6 days, respectively, and are most likely of rocky composition. Here we
review the history of how they were found, and present an overview of the

delay time distribution (DTD) of binary neutron stars (BNS) through scaling
relations between halo/stellar mass and the star formation history (SFH) of
galaxies hosting gravitational wave (GW) events in the local universe. Here we
explore how a detailed reconstruction of the individual SFHs of BNS merger host
galaxies can improve on the use of the scaling relations. We use galaxies from
the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, which is mass complete at
$M_*>10^9$ M$_\odot$ in the redshift range $0.05<z<0.08$. We use the
reconstructed SFHs derived from the Prospector code, for two distinct sets of
priors (favoring continuous and bursty SFHs), and convolve those with power law
DTDs characterized by an index $\Gamma$ and a minimum delay time $t_{\rm min}$.
We find that with this approach $\mathcal{O}(100)-\mathcal{O}(300)$ host
galaxies are required to constrain the DTD parameters, with the number
depending on the choice of SFH prior and on the parameters of the true DTD. We
further show that using only the host galaxies of BNS mergers, as opposed to
the full population of potential host galaxies in the relevant cosmic volume,
leads to a minor bias in the recovered DTD parameters. The required host galaxy
sample size is nearly an order of magnitude smaller relative to the approach of
using scaling relations, and we expect such a host galaxy sample to be
collected within a decade or two, prior to the advent of third-generation GW
detectors.

observationally constrain the fraction of sources in the RM catalogue affected

performed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at 1--2 GHz, with 23
n$\pi$-ambiguity candidates selected by their peculiarly high |RM| values. We
identified nine sources with erroneous RM values due to n$\pi$-ambiguity and 11

cases. By comparing the statistical distributions of the above two main
classes, we devised a measure of how much a source's RM deviates from that of

agree with stellar wind and photospheric spectral features, and infer the
spectral shapes and strengths of the ionizing continua. Inferred light-weighted
stellar metallicities span 0.05-1.5 Z$_\odot$ and are similar to the measured
nebular metallicities. We quantify the ionizing continua using the ratio of the
ionizing flux at 900\AA\ to the non-ionizing flux at 1500\AA\ and demonstrate
the evolution of this ratio with stellar age and metallicity using theoretical
single burst models. These single burst models only match the inferred ionizing
continua of half of the sample, while the other half are described by a mixture
of stellar ages. Mixed age populations produce stronger and harder ionizing
spectra than continuous star formation histories, but, contrary to previous
studies that assume constant star formation, have similar stellar and nebular
metallicities. Stellar population age and metallicity affect the far-UV
continua in different and distinguishable ways; assuming a constant star
formation history diminishes the diagnostic power. Finally, we provide simple
prescriptions to determine the ionizing photon production efficiency

of log($\xi_{ion})=24.4-25.7$ Hz erg$^{-1}$ that depends on stellar age,

nucleosynthesis calculations with recent disk calculations to make predictions
of the observational imprints these explosions would leave on very metal-poor

yields a relatively high (> 0.08 $M_\odot$) r-process mass would, after
subsequently mixing and forming new stars, result in [r/Fe] abundances up to
three orders of magnitude higher than those seen in stars. In order to match
inferred abundances, 10-10$^3 M_\odot$ of Fe would need be efficiently
incorporated into the r-process ejecta. We show that Fe enhancement and hence
[r/Fe] dilution from other nearby supernovae is not able to explain the
observations unless significant inflow of pristine gas occurs before the ejecta
are able to form new stars. Finally, we show that the inferred [Eu/Fe]
abundances require levels of gas mixing which are in conflict with other
properties of r-process enhanced metal-poor stars. Our results suggest that
early r-process production is likely to be spatially uncorrelated with Fe
production, a condition which can be satisfied by neutron star mergers due to
their large kick velocities and purely r-process yields.

unpolarised sources were reported as polarised at about 0.5% level in the RM
catalogue, and noted significant differences between our newly derived RM
values and the catalogue values for the remaining 21 sources. These
discrepancies are attributed to off-axis instrumental polarisation in the NVSS
RM catalogue. By adopting the 0.5% above as the typical off-axis instrumental
polarisation amplitude, we quantified its effect on the reported RMs with a
simulation, and found that on average the RM uncertainties in the catalogue
have to be increased by $\approx$ 10% to account for the off-axis instrumental
polarisation effect. This effect is more substantial for sources with lower
fractional polarisation, and is a function of the source's true RM. Moreover,
the distribution of the resulting RM uncertainty is highly non-Gaussian. With
the extra RM uncertainty incorporated, we found that the RM values from the two

seed a diffusion with maximum expected spread size, under the independent
cascade model with cascade probability $p$. Most of the previous work on this
problem (known as influence maximization) focuses on efficient algorithms to
approximate the optimal seed set with provable guarantees given knowledge of
the entire network; however, obtaining full knowledge of the network is often
very costly in practice. Here we develop algorithms and guarantees for
approximating the optimal seed set while bounding how much network information
is collected. First, we study the achievable guarantees using a sublinear
influence sample size. We provide an almost tight approximation algorithm with
an additive $\epsilon n$ loss and show that the squared dependence of sample
size on $k$ is asymptotically optimal when $\epsilon$ is small. We then propose
a probing algorithm that queries edges from the graph and use them to find a
seed set with the same almost tight approximation guarantee. We also provide a
matching (up to logarithmic factors) lower-bound on the required number of
edges. This algorithm is implementable in field surveys or in crawling online
networks. Our probing takes $p$ as an input which may not be known in advance,
and we show how to down-sample the probed edges to match the best estimate of
$p$ if they are collected with a higher probability. Finally, we test our
algorithms on an empirical network to quantify the tradeoff between the cost of
obtaining more refined network information and the benefit of the added
information for guiding improved seeding strategies.

permutations in a variety of scientific domains, permutations require a
judicious choice of the delay parameter $\tau$ and dimension $n$. However, $n$

leakage through channels to the case of interactive systems, and establish a

between polynomial and exponential antichain growth, and a polynomial time

polarization of the incident wave and substitute the anisotropic metasurface by
an omega-bianisotropic one. The problem is approached from two sides: By
directly solving the corresponding boundary problem and by considering the
``time-reversed'' scenario when a surface wave is converted into a nonuniform
plane wave. We develop a practical three-layer metasurface based on a
conventional printed circuit board technology to mimic the omega-bianisotropic
response. The metasurface incorporates metallic walls to avoid coupling between
adjacent unit cells and accelerate the design procedure. The design is
validated with full-wave three-dimensional numerical simulations and

combining occultation observations from several sites, size and shape can be
derived with kilometric accuracy. Also, atmospheric properties can be derived
if the body has an atmosphere. Furthermore, the technique can detect rings and
even satellites (although rarely) around the main body. Except for the very
special cases of Pluto and Charon, stellar occultations by Transneptunian
Objects (TNOs) had never been observed until October 2009. This was because the
ephemeris of the TNOs have much larger uncertainties than their angular
diameters (typically of the order of ~10 milliarcsecond) and also because
stellar catalogs were not accurate to the milliarcsecond level. Despite the
difficulties, at the time of this writing, 43 occultations by 22 different
Trans-Neptunian Objects, and 17 occultations by 5 Centaurs have been detected
thanks to the efforts of several teams. Due to the complications of accurately
predicting and observing these events, most of the successes have been achieved
through wide international collaboration, which is a key issue to succeed in
observing stellar occultations by TNOs. Multichord occultations are typically
detected at a rate of ~3 per year on average, whereas the majority of the
observed occultations are single-chord detections, which means that only one
site detects the occultation. In these cases, no tight constraints on size and
shape can be derived from those observations alone. Here we review most of the
aspects involved in the complex process to successfully observe occultations,
and present some of the lessons learned.

lost sales, and positive lead times. This is a fundamental problem in inventory
management, with significant literature establishing near-optimality of a
simple class of policies called ``base-stock policies'' for the underlying
Markov Decision Process (MDP), as well as convexity of long run average-cost
under those policies. We consider the relatively less studied problem of
designing a learning algorithm for this problem when the underlying demand
distribution is unknown. The goal is to bound regret of the algorithm when
compared to the best base-stock policy. We utilize the convexity properties and
a newly derived bound on bias of base-stock policies to establish a connection
to stochastic convex bandit optimization.
  Our main contribution is a learning algorithm with a regret bound of
$\tilde{O}(L\sqrt{T}+D)$ for the inventory control problem. Here $L$ is the
fixed and known lead time, and $D$ is an unknown parameter of the demand
distribution described roughly as the number of time steps needed to generate
enough demand for depleting one unit of inventory. Notably, even though the
state space of the underlying MDP is continuous and $L$-dimensional, our regret
bounds depend linearly on $L$. Our results significantly improve the previously
best known regret bounds for this problem where the dependence on $L$ was
exponential and many further assumptions on demand distribution were required.
The techniques presented here may be of independent interest for other settings
that involve large structured MDPs but with convex cost functions.

breaks explicitly this symmetry by choosing a specific boundary metric and a

induced metric and an induced connection on the tangent bundle of the boundary

uniquely determined by the induced metric). Properly invoking this boundary
geometry has far-reaching consequences: the holographic dictionary extends and
naturally encodes Weyl-covariant geometrical data, and, most importantly, the
Weyl anomaly gains a clearer geometrical interpretation, cohomologically
relating two Weyl-transformed volumes. The boundary theory is enhanced due to
the presence of the Weyl current, which participates with the stress tensor in

facilitates long-range cell-cell mechanical communications that would be
impossible on linear elastic substrates. Past research has described the
contribution of two separated effects on the range of force transmission,
including ECM elastic non-linearity and fiber alignment. However, the relation
between these different effects is unclear, and how they combine to dictate
force transmission range is still elusive. Here, we combine discrete fiber
simulations with continuum modeling to study the decay of displacements induced
by a contractile cell in fibrous networks. We demonstrate that fiber
non-linearity and fiber reorientation both contribute to the strain-induced
anisotropy of the elastic moduli of the cell local environment. This elastic
anisotropy is a parameter that governs the slow decay of the displacements, and
it depends on the magnitude of applied strain, either an external tension or an
internal contraction as a model of the cell. Furthermore, we show that
accounting for artificially-prescribed elastic anisotropy dictates the
displacement decay induced by a contracting cell. Our findings unify previous
single effects into a mechanical theory that explains force transmission in
fibrous networks. This work provides important insights into biological
processes that involve the coordinated action of distant cells mediated by the
ECM, such that occur in morphogenesis, wound healing, angiogenesis, and cancer
metastasis. It may also provide design parameters for biomaterials to control
force transmission between cells, as a way to guide morphogenesis in tissue

streams modulate the propagation behaviour of interplanetary coronal mass
ejections and are themselves an important driver of recurrent geomagnetic storm
activity. The knowledge of the ambient solar wind flows and fields is thus an
essential component of successful space weather forecasting. Here, we present
an implementation of an operational framework for operating, validating and
optimizing models of the ambient solar wind flow on the example of Carrington
Rotation 2077. We reconstruct the global topology of the coronal magnetic field
using the potential field source surface model (PFSS) and the Schatten current
sheet model (SCS), and discuss three empirical relationships for specifying the
solar wind conditions near the Sun, namely the Wang-Sheeley (WS) model, the
distance from the coronal hole boundary (DCHB) model, and the Wang-Sheeley-Arge
(WSA) model. By adding uncertainty in the latitude about the sub-Earth point,
we select an ensemble of initial conditions and map the solutions to Earth by
the Heliospheric Upwind eXtrapolation (HUX) model. We assess the forecasting
performance from a continuous variable validation, and find that the WSA model
most accurately predicts the solar wind speed time series. We note that the
process of ensemble forecasting slightly improves the forecasting performance
of all solar wind models investigated. We conclude that the implemented

the modeling side, we introduce a novel fully convolutional model of lane
detection that learns to decode lane structures instead of delegating structure
inference to post-processing. In contrast to previous works, our convolutional
decoder is able to represent an arbitrary number of lanes per image, preserves
the polyline representation of lanes without reducing lanes to polynomials, and
draws lanes iteratively without requiring the computational and temporal
complexity of recurrent neural networks. Because our model includes an estimate
of the joint distribution of neighboring pixels belonging to the same lane, our
formulation includes a natural and computationally cheap definition of
uncertainty. On the training side, we demonstrate a simple yet effective
approach to adapt the model to new environments using unsupervised style
transfer. By training FastDraw to make predictions of lane structure that are
invariant to low-level stylistic differences between images, we achieve strong
performance at test time in weather and lighting conditions that deviate
substantially from those of the annotated datasets that are publicly available.

  and Consistency","36 pages, 8 figures",,,,"math.ST math.NA stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Bayesian formulation of inverse problems is attractive for three primary
reasons: it provides a clear modelling framework; means for uncertainty
quantification; and it allows for principled learning of hyperparameters. The
posterior distribution may be explored by sampling methods, but for many
problems it is computationally infeasible to do so. In this situation maximum a
posteriori (MAP) estimators are often sought. Whilst these are relatively cheap
to compute, and have an attractive variational formulation, a key drawback is
their lack of invariance under change of parameterization. This is a
particularly significant issue when hierarchical priors are employed to learn
hyperparameters. In this paper we study the effect of the choice of
parameterization on MAP estimators when a conditionally Gaussian hierarchical
prior distribution is employed. Specifically we consider the centred
parameterization, the natural parameterization in which the unknown state is
solved for directly, and the noncentred parameterization, which works with a
whitened Gaussian as the unknown state variable, and arises when considering
dimension-robust MCMC algorithms; MAP estimation is well-defined in the
nonparametric setting only for the noncentred parameterization. However, we
show that MAP estimates based on the noncentred parameterization are not
consistent as estimators of hyperparameters; conversely, we show that limits of
finite-dimensional centred MAP estimators are consistent as the dimension tends
to infinity. We also consider empirical Bayesian hyperparameter estimation,
show consistency of these estimates, and demonstrate that they are more robust
with respect to noise than centred MAP estimates. An underpinning concept
throughout is that hyperparameters may only be recovered up to measure
equivalence, a well-known phenomenon in the context of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process.

execution of so-called smart contracts, i.e. programs that regulate the

blockchain, the state of smart contracts is collaboratively maintained by a
peer-to-peer network of mutually untrusted nodes, which collect from users a
set of transactions (representing the required actions on contracts), and
execute them in some order. Once this sequence of transactions is appended to
the blockchain, the other nodes validate it, re-executing the transactions in
the same order. The serial execution of transactions does not take advantage of
the multi-core architecture of modern processors, so contributing to limit the
throughput. In this paper we propose a true concurrent model of smart contract

exploited to parallelize the execution of transactions.

heterogeneous composition of the mass of investors in a market, the agent-based
model considers two different types of traders: noise traders and contrarians.
Agents are represented as nodes in a network of interactions and they can
assume any of three distinct possible states (e.g. buy, sell or remain
inactive). The time evolution of the state of an agent is dictated by
probabilistic dynamics that include both local and global influences. A noise
trader is subject to local interactions, tending to assume the majority state
of its nearest neighbors, whilst a contrarian is subject to a global
interaction with the behavior of the market as a whole, tending to assume the
state of the global minority of the market. The model exhibits the typical
qualitative and quantitative features of real financial time series, including
distributions of returns with heavy tails, volatility clustering and long-time
memory for the absolute values of the returns. The distributions of returns are
fitted by means of coupled Gaussian distributions, quantitatively revealing
transitions between leptokurtic, mesokurtic and platykurtic regimes in terms of
a non-linear statistical coupling which describes the complexity of the system.

interference pattern in the XUV region. By controlling the relative optical
phase between the two driving laser pulses we are able to actively influence
the delay between the pulses and are able to perform very stable and precise
pump-probe experiments. Because of the phase operation occurs across the entire

self-consistent approach. The $4\pi$ geometry is crucial as it allows us to
follow the growth and evolution of convective modes on the largest possible
scales. We find significant differences between the kinematic, thermodynamic
and chemical evolution of the 3D and the 1D model. The 3D model shows vigorous
convection leading to more efficient mixing of nuclear species. In the 3D case
the entire oxygen shell attains convective Mach numbers of $\mathord{\approx}\,
0.1$, whereas in the 1D model, the convective velocities are much lower and
there is negligible overshooting across convective boundaries. In the 3D case,
the convective eddies entrain nuclear species from the neon (and carbon) layers
into the deeper part of the oxygen burning shell, where they burn and power a
violent convection phase with outflows. This is a prototypical model of a
convective-reactive system. Due to the strong convection and the resulting
efficient mixing, the interface between the neon layer and the silicon-enriched
oxygen layer disappears during the evolution, and silicon is mixed far out into
merged oxygen/neon shell. Neon entrained inwards by convective downdrafts
burns, resulting in lower neon mass in the 3D model compared to the 1D model at
time of collapse. In addition, the 3D model develops remarkable large-scale,
large-amplitude asymmetries, which may have important implications for the
impending gravitational collapse and the subsequent explosion.

the case when all the leader and follower agents are affected by disturbances,

Second, we assume the disturbances to be bounded only in rates of change rather
than magnitude as in the literature. To address this new problem, we propose a
novel observer-based distributed tracking control design. As a distinguishing
feature, the followers can cooperatively estimate the disturbance affecting the
leader to adjust their maneuvers accordingly, which is enabled by the design of
the first-of-its-kind distributed disturbance observers. We build specific
tracking control approaches for both first- and second-order MASs and prove
that they can lead to bounded-error tracking, despite the challenges due to the
relaxed assumptions about disturbances. We further perform simulation to

Fisher Information Matrix formalism to forecast the precision of this method in
the idealized case of a perfectly ordered velocity field defined on an
infinitesimally thin disk. For nearly face-on targets one shear component,
$\gamma_\times$, can be constrained to $0.003\frac{90}{I_0}\frac{25}{n_{\rm

is the number of pixels across a diameter enclosing 80\% of the light. This
precision degrades with inclination angle, by a factor of three by
$i{=}50^\circ$. Uncertainty on the other shear component, $\gamma_+$, is about
1.5 (7) times larger than the $\gamma_\times$ uncertainty for targets at
$i=10^\circ$ ($50^\circ$). For arbitrary galaxy position angle on the sky,
these forecasts apply not to $\gamma_+$ and $\gamma_\times$ as defined on the
sky, but to two eigenvectors in $(\gamma_+, \gamma_\times,\mu)$ space where
$\mu$ is the magnification. We also forecast the potential of less expensive
partial observations of the velocity field such as slit spectroscopy. We
conclude by outlining some ways in which real galaxies depart from our
idealized model and thus create random or systematic uncertainties not captured

limited only by the data quality rather than scatter in galaxy properties

value of information leakage over all feasible program runs and it fails to
identify vulnerable programs where only limited number of runs leak large
amount of information. As discussed in Bielova (2016), a good notion for
dynamic leakage and an efficient way of computing the leakage are needed. To
address this problem, the authors have already proposed two notions for dynamic
leakage and a method of quantifying dynamic leakage based on model counting.
Inspired by the work of Kawamoto et. al. (2017), this paper proposes two
efficient methods for computing dynamic leakage, a compositional method along
with the sequential structure of a program and a parallel computation based on
the value domain decomposition. For the former, we also investigate both exact
and approximated calculations. From the perspective of implementation, we
utilize binary decision diagrams (BDDs) and deterministic decomposable negation
normal forms (d-DNNFs) to represent Boolean formulas in model counting.
Finally, we show experimental results on several examples.

approximately transform away the coupling between the fast gyration around
magnetic fields lines and the remaining slow dynamics. This basic understanding
now serves as a foundation for describing the kinetic theory of strongly
magnetized plasmas. I present a new way to understand guiding center dynamics
that does not involve complicated coordinate transformations. Starting from a
dynamical systems formulation of the motion of parameterized loops in a charged

Dynamics on this formal slow manifold are equivalent to guiding center dynamics
to all orders in perturbation theory. After demonstrating that loop space
dynamics comprises an infinite-dimensional noncanonical Hamiltonian system, I
recover the well-known Hamiltonian formulation of guiding center motion by
restricting the (pre-) symplectic structure on loop space to the
finite-dimensional guiding center formal slow manifold.

Website at https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/vpa/home",,,,"cs.RO cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Planning for robotic manipulation requires reasoning about the changes a
robot can affect on objects. When such interactions can be modelled
analytically, as in domains with rigid objects, efficient planning algorithms
exist. However, in both domestic and industrial domains, the objects of
interest can be soft, or deformable, and hard to model analytically. For such
cases, we posit that a data-driven modelling approach is more suitable. In
recent years, progress in deep generative models has produced methods that
learn to `imagine' plausible images from data. Building on the recent Causal
InfoGAN generative model, in this work we learn to imagine goal-directed object
manipulation directly from raw image data of self-supervised interaction of the
robot with the object. After learning, given a goal observation of the system,
our model can generate an imagined plan -- a sequence of images that transition
the object into the desired goal. To execute the plan, we use it as a reference
trajectory to track with a visual servoing controller, which we also learn from
the data as an inverse dynamics model. In a simulated manipulation task, we
show that separating the problem into visual planning and visual tracking
control is more sample efficient and more interpretable than alternative
data-driven approaches. We further demonstrate our approach on learning to
imagine and execute in 3 environments, the final of which is deformable rope
manipulation on a PR2 robot.

approaches in this domain rely on manual feature engineering and do not allow

Networks with Label Smoothness regularization (KGNN-LS) to provide better
recommendations. Conceptually, our approach computes user-specific item
embeddings by first applying a trainable function that identifies important
knowledge graph relationships for a given user. This way we transform the
knowledge graph into a user-specific weighted graph and then apply a graph
neural network to compute personalized item embeddings. To provide better
inductive bias, we rely on label smoothness assumption, which posits that
adjacent items in the knowledge graph are likely to have similar user relevance
labels/scores. Label smoothness provides regularization over the edge weights
and we prove that it is equivalent to a label propagation scheme on a graph. We
also develop an efficient implementation that shows strong scalability with
respect to the knowledge graph size. Experiments on four datasets show that our
method outperforms state of the art baselines. KGNN-LS also achieves strong
performance in cold-start scenarios where user-item interactions are sparse.

anti-correlated variations in transit times. Holman et al. 2010 were able to
readily show that these objects were planetary mass, confirming them as bona
fide planets Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c. As a multi-transiting system exhibiting
strong TTVs, the relative planetary properties (e.g., mass ratio, radius ratio)
were strongly constrained, opening a new chapter in comparative planetology.
KOI-377.03, a small planet with a 1.5-day period, was not initially discovered
by the Kepler pipeline, but was identified during the analysis of the other
planets and was later confirmed as Kepler-9d through the BLENDER technique by
Torres et al. 2011. Holman et al. 2010 included significant dynamical analysis
to characterize Kepler-9's particular TTVs: planets near resonance show large
amplitude anti-correlated TTVs with a period corresponding to the rotation of
the line of conjunctions and an additional ""chopping"" signal due to the
changing positions of the planets. We also review the updated properties of
this system and propose ideas for future investigations.

reinforcement learning and variable compliance control that features
sophisticated contact manipulation. One of the key challenges in applying
reinforcement learning to physical robot is the sample complexity, the
requirement of large amounts of experience for learning. We mitigate this
sample complexity problem by incorporating an iteratively refitted model into
the learning process through model-guided exploration. Yet, fitting a local
model of the physical environment is of major difficulties. In this work, a
Kalman filter is used to combine the adaptive linear dynamics with a coarse
prior model from analytical description, and proves to give more accurate
predictions than the existing method. Experimental results show that the
proposed model fitting strategy can be incorporated into a model predictive
controller to generate good exploration behaviors for learning acceleration,
while preserving the benefits of model-free reinforcement learning for
uncertain environments. In addition to the sample complexity, the inevitable
robot overloaded during operation also tends to limit the learning efficiency.
To address this problem, we present a method to restrict the largest possible
potential energy in the compliance control system and therefore keep the
contact force within the legitimate range.

achieving desired job properties a challenging task requiring operators to
complete extensive and costly training. Despite this, operator fatigue is
common with implications for personal safety, project timeliness, cost, and
quality. While full automation is not yet achievable due to unpredictability

allow operators to issue high-level commands in an intuitive, task-informed

properties.
  In this paper, we compare a number of modes of teleoperation, exploring both
the number of dimensions of the control input as well as the most intuitive
control spaces. Our experimental evaluations of the performance metrics were
based on quantifying the difficulty of tasks based on the well known Fitts' law
as well as a measure of how well constraints affecting the task performance

customers' behaviour in order to provide a smooth and pleasant shopping
experience that attracts more customers everyday and maximises their revenue,
consequently. Humans can flawlessly understand others' behaviour by combining
different visual cues from activity to gestures and facial expressions.
Empowering the computer vision systems to do so, however, is still an open
problem due to its intrinsic challenges as well as extrinsic enforced
difficulties like lack of publicly available data and unique environment
conditions (wild). In this work, We emphasise on detecting the first and by far
the most crucial cue in behaviour analysis; that is human activity detection in
computer vision. To do so, we introduce a framework for integrating human pose
and object motion to both temporally detect and classify the activities in a
fine-grained manner (very short and similar activities). We incorporate partial
human pose and interaction with the objects in a multi-stream neural network
architecture to guide the spatiotemporal attention mechanism for more efficient
activity recognition. To this end, in the absence of pose supervision, we
propose to use the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate exact joint
locations from noisy probability heat maps. Additionally, based on the
intuition that complex actions demand more than one source of information to be
identified even by humans, we integrate the second stream of object motion to
our network as a prior knowledge that we quantitatively show improves the
recognition results. We empirically show the capability of our approach by
achieving state-of-the-art results on MERL shopping dataset. We further
investigate the effectiveness of this approach on a new shopping dataset that
we have collected to address existing shortcomings.

We consider
a general notion of fairness via stability: A committee is stable if no

that all these voters strictly prefer the new committee to the existing one.
Our main contribution is to extend this definition to stability of a
distribution (or lottery) over committees. We consider two canonical voter
preference models: the Approval Set setting where each voter approves a set of
candidates and prefers committees with larger intersection with this set; and
the Ranking setting where each voter ranks committees based on how much she
likes her favorite candidate in a committee. Our main result is to show that
stable lotteries always exist for these canonical preference models.
Interestingly, given preferences of voters over committees, the procedure for
computing an approximately stable lottery is the same for both models and
therefore extends to the setting where some voters have the former preference
structure and others have the latter. Our existence proof uses the
probabilistic method and a new large deviation inequality that may be of

form: \begin{align*} \min_{x} \sum_{i} f_i( A_i x + b_i), \end{align*} where
$f_i$ are convex functions on $\mathbb{R}^{n_i}$ with constant $n_i$, $A_i \in
\mathbb{R}^{n_i \times d}$, $b_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i}$ and $\sum_i n_i = n$.
This problem generalizes linear programming and includes many problems in
empirical risk minimization. In this paper, we give an algorithm that runs in
time \begin{align*} O^* ( ( n^{\omega} + n^{2.5 - \alpha/2} + n^{2+ 1/6} ) \log
(n / \delta) ) \end{align*} where $\omega$ is the exponent of matrix
multiplication, $\alpha$ is the dual exponent of matrix multiplication, and
$\delta$ is the relative accuracy. Note that the runtime has only a log
dependence on the condition numbers or other data dependent parameters and
these are captured in $\delta$. For the current bound $\omega \sim 2.38$
[Vassilevska Williams'12, Le Gall'14] and $\alpha \sim 0.31$ [Le Gall,
Urrutia'18], our runtime $O^* ( n^{\omega} \log (n / \delta))$ matches the
current best for solving a dense least squares regression problem, a special
case of the problem we consider. Very recently, [Alman'18] proved that all the
current known techniques can not give a better $\omega$ below $2.168$ which is
larger than our $2+1/6$. Our result generalizes the very recent result of
solving linear programs in the current matrix multiplication time [Cohen, Lee,
Song'19] to a more broad class of problems. Our algorithm proposes two concepts
which are different from [Cohen, Lee, Song'19] :
  $\bullet$ We give a robust deterministic central path method, whereas the
previous one is a stochastic central path which updates weights by a random
sparse vector.
  $\bullet$ We propose an efficient data-structure to maintain the central path
of interior point methods even when the weights update vector is dense.

This variant of the voter model can capture a wide range of individuals

opinion of the majority/minority. Motivated by political campaigns which aim to
influence opinion dynamics by the end of a fixed deadline, we focus on
influencing strategies for finite time horizons. We characterize the nature of
optimal influencing strategies as a function of the nature of individuals
forming the society. Using this, we show that for a society consisting of
predominantly strong-willed/rebel individuals, the optimal strategy is to
influence towards the end of the finite time horizon, whereas, for a society
predominantly consisting of conformist individuals who try to adopt the opinion
of the majority, it could be optimal to influence in the initial phase of the
finite time horizon.

storage cost and fast query speed in multi-modal data retrievals. However, most
existing hashing methods are based on hand-crafted or raw level features of
objects, which may not be optimally compatible with the coding process.
Besides, these hashing methods are mainly designed to handle simple pairwise
similarity. The complex multilevel ranking semantic structure of instances
associated with multiple labels has not been well explored yet. In this paper,
we propose a ranking-based deep cross-modal hashing approach (RDCMH). RDCMH
firstly uses the feature and label information of data to derive a
semi-supervised semantic ranking list. Next, to expand the semantic
representation power of hand-crafted features, RDCMH integrates the semantic
ranking information into deep cross-modal hashing and jointly optimizes the
compatible parameters of deep feature representations and of hashing functions.
Experiments on real multi-modal datasets show that RDCMH outperforms other
competitive baselines and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in
cross-modal retrieval applications.

tracking. However, subject-independent models achieve limited accuracy partly
due to individual variations. To improve estimation, we propose a novel gaze
decomposition method and a single gaze point calibration method, motivated by
our finding that the inter-subject squared bias exceeds the intra-subject
variance for a subject-independent estimator. We decompose the gaze angle into
a subject-dependent bias term and a subject-independent term between the gaze
angle and the bias. The subject-independent term is estimated by a deep
convolutional network. For calibration-free tracking, we set the
subject-dependent bias term to zero. For single gaze point calibration, we
estimate the bias from a few images taken as the subject gazes at a point.
Experiments on three datasets indicate that as a calibration-free estimator,
the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by up to $10.0\%$.
The proposed calibration method is robust and reduces estimation error
significantly (up to $35.6\%$), achieving state-of-the-art performance for

one requires handling large connectivity (adjacency) matrices. Also, to find
out the spectra of these networks, one needs to perform the EigenValue
Decomposition(or Singular Value Decomposition for bipartite networks) of these
large adjacency matrices or their Laplacian matrices. In the present work, we
proposed randomized versions of the existing heuristics to infer the norm and
the spectrum of the adjacency matrices. In an earlier work [1], we used Subset
Selection (SS) procedure to obtain the critical network structure which is
smaller in size and retains the properties of original networks in terms of its
Principal Singular Vector and eigenvalue spectra. We now present a few
randomized versions of SS (RSS) and their time and space complexity calculation
on various benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the RSS based on
using QR decomposition instead of SVD in deterministic SS is the fastest. We
evaluate the correctness and the performance speed after running these
randomized SS heuristics on test networks and comparing the results with
deterministic counterpart reported earlier. We find the proposed methods can be
used effectively in large and sparse networks; they can be extended to analyse
important network structure in dynamically evolving networks owing to their
reduced time complexity.

which receives large-scale data in a streaming manner to update the hash
functions on-the-fly. Its key challenge lies in the difficulty of balancing the
learning timeliness and model accuracy. To this end, most works follow a
supervised setting, i.e., using class labels to boost the hashing performance,
which defects in two aspects: First, strong constraints, e.g., orthogonal or
similarity preserving, are used, which however are typically relaxed and lead
to large accuracy drop. Second, large amounts of training batches are required
to learn the up-to-date hash functions, which largely increase the learning
complexity. To handle the above challenges, a novel supervised online hashing
scheme termed Hadamard Matrix Guided Online Hashing (HMOH) is proposed in this
paper. Our key innovation lies in introducing Hadamard matrix, which is an
orthogonal binary matrix built via Sylvester method. In particular, to release
the need of strong constraints, we regard each column of Hadamard matrix as the
target code for each class label, which by nature satisfies several desired
properties of hashing codes. To accelerate the online training, LSH is first
adopted to align the lengths of target code and to-be-learned binary code. We
then treat the learning of hash functions as a set of binary classification
problems to fit the assigned target code. Finally, extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method over
various state-of-the-art methods. Codes are available at

paradigm. In this paradigm, different services have diverse computing
requirements that justify deploying an inconsistently Heterogeneous Computing
(HC) system to efficiently process them. In an inconsistently HC system, each
task needed for a given service, potentially exhibits different execution times
on each type of machine. An ideal resource allocation system must be aware of
such uncertainties in execution times and be robust against them, so that
Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of users are met. This research aims to
maximize the robustness of an HC system utilized to offer a serverless
computing system, particularly when the system is oversubscribed. Our strategy
to maximize robustness is to develop a task pruning mechanism that can be added
to existing task-mapping heuristics without altering them. Pruning tasks with a
low probability of meeting their deadlines improves the likelihood of other
tasks meeting their deadlines, thereby increasing system robustness and overall
QoS. To evaluate the impact of the pruning mechanism, we examine it on various
configurations of heterogeneous and homogeneous computing systems. Evaluation
results indicate a considerable improvement (up to 35%) in the system
robustness.

to pre-process multiple versions of each video and use Content Delivery

However, with the fast-growing video repository sizes, caching video contents
in multiple versions on each CDN is becoming inefficient. Accordingly, in this
paper, we propose the architecture for Fog Delivery Networks (FDN) and provide
methods to federate them (called F-FDN) to reduce video streaming latency. In
addition to caching, FDNs have the ability to process videos in an on-demand
manner. F-FDN leverages cached contents on the neighboring FDNs to further
reduce latency. In particular, F-FDN is equipped with methods that aim at
reducing latency through probabilistically evaluating the cost benefit of
fetching video segments either from neighboring FDNs or by processing them.
Experimental results against alternative streaming methods show that both
on-demand processing and leveraging cached video segments on neighboring FDNs

intelligences are created to solve image processing tasks that we are
inherently good at. As such we propose a model that estimates depth from a
monocular image. Our approach utilizes a combination of structure from motion
and stereo disparity. We estimate a pose between the source image and a
different viewpoint and a dense depth map and use a simple transformation to
reconstruct the image seen from said viewpoint. We can then use the real image
at that viewpoint to act as supervision to train out model. The metric chosen
for image comparison employs standard L1 and structural similarity and a
consistency constraint between depth maps as well as smoothness constraint. We
show that similar to human perception utilizing the correlation within the
provided data by two different approaches increases the accuracy and
outperforms the individual components.

quasi-particles are intimately linked to each other. Whenever a symmetry is
broken, it leaves its fingerprints, and that may be observed indirectly via its
influence on the other quasi-particles. Here, we report the strong signature of
broken rotational symmetry induced due to long range-ordering of spins in Mn -
sublattice of LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 below Tc ~ 113 K reflected with the marked changes
in the lattice vibrations using Raman scattering. In particular, the majority
of the observed first-order phonon modes show a sharp shift in frequency in the
vicinity of long range magnetic-ordering temperature. Phonons exist in a
crystalline system because of broken translational symmetry, therefore any
renormalization in the phonon-spectrum could be a good gauge for broken
translational symmetry. Anomalous evolution of the few modes associated with
stretching of Mn/NiO6 octahedra in the intermediate temperature range (~ 60-260
K) marked the broken translational symmetry attributed to the charge ordering.
Interestingly same modes also show strong coupling with magnetic degrees of
freedom, suggesting that charge-ordering and magnetic transition may be linked
to each other.

0.2 arcseconds per year. Assuming that these high velocity ejecta knots are
traveling ahead of the forward shock of the SNR, we estimate the distance to

formation of the large-scale structure of the universe. Nonthermal cosmic-ray
(CR) protons are expected to be accelerated via diffusive shock acceleration
(DSA) in those ICM shocks, although observational evidence for the $\gamma$-ray
emission of hadronic origin from galaxy clusters has yet to be established.
Considering the results obtained from recent plasma simulations, we improve the
analytic test-particle DSA model for weak quasi-parallel ($Q_\parallel$)
shocks, previously suggested by \citet{kang2010}. In the model CR spectrum, the
transition from the postshock thermal to CR populations occurs at the injection
momentum, $p_{\rm inj}$, above which protons can undergo the full DSA process.
As the shock energy is transferred to CR protons, the postshock gas temperature
should decrease accordingly and the subshock strength weakens due to the
dynamical feed of the CR pressure to the shock structure. This results in the
reduction of the injection fraction, although the postshock CR pressure
approaches an asymptotic value when the CR spectrum extends to the relativistic
regime. Our new DSA model self-consistently accounts for such behaviors and
adopts better estimations for $p_{\rm inj}$. With our model DSA spectrum, the
CR acceleration efficiency ranges $\eta\sim10^{-3}-0.01$ for supercritical,
$Q_\parallel$-shocks with sonic Mach number $2.25\lesssim M_{\rm s}\lesssim5$
in the ICM. Based on \citet{ha2018b}, on the other hand, we argue that proton
acceleration would be negligible in subcritical shocks with $M_{\rm s}<2.25$.

operators, given as multiplications by polynomials, have to be specified as
e.g. left or right multiplication operators since the polynomial algebras are
replaced by quadratic, non-commutative algebras. In the settings we are
interested in, there are bilinear pairings which allows us to define
differential operators as duals of multiplication operators. Indeed, there are
different choices of pairings which lead to quite different results. We
consider three different pairings. The pairings are between quantized
generalized Verma modules and quantized holomorphically induced modules. It is
a natural demand that the corresponding representations can be expressed by
(matrix valued) differential operators. We show that a quantum Weyl algebra
${\mathcal W}eyl_q(n,n)$ introduced by T. Hyashi (Comm. Math. Phys. 1990) plays
a fundamental role. In fact, for one pairing, the algebra of differential
operators, though inherently depending on a choice of basis, is precisely
matrices over ${\mathcal W}eyl_q(n,n)$. We determine explicitly the form of the

have prepared a SSH chain in its {\it stroboscopic} topological state, starting
from the trivial one, by application of a periodic perturbation. The periodic
driving, we employ here, is adiabatically switched on to break the
particle-hole symmetry and generate a chiral mass term in the effective Floquet
Hamiltonian; consequently the Floquet Hamiltonian also gets deformed without
crossing the gapless quantum critical point. The particle hole symmetry is
subsequently restored in the Floquet Hamiltonian by adiabatically switching off
a part of the periodic potential. Thereafter, the Floquet Hamiltonian develops
a symmetry protected non-trivial topological winding number. Furthermore, we
also observe stroboscopic topologically protected localised edge states in a
long open chain and show that a bulk boundary correspondence survives a unitary
non-equilibrium situation in 1D BDI Hamiltonians. Moreover, considering an
extended SSH chain with higher neighbour hoppings, we dynamically prepare the
system in a stroboscopic out-of-equilibrium topological insulator state
starting from a metallic regime. At the same time, we establish the dynamical
preparation of higher winding phases in an extended SSH chain with stroboscopic

mental wellbeing. Mediation studies, however, focus on a limited number of
mechanisms and rely on remotely sensed greenery measures, which do not
accurately capture how neighborhood greenery is perceived on the ground. To
examine: 1) how streetscape and remote sensing-based greenery affect people's
mental wellbeing in Guangzhou, China; 2) whether and, if so, to what extent the
associations are mediated by physical activity, stress, air quality and noise,
and social cohesion; and 3) whether differences in the mediation across the
streetscape greenery and NDVI exposure metrics occurred. Mental wellbeing was
quantified by the WHO-5 wellbeing index. Greenery measures were extracted at
the neighborhood level: 1) streetscape greenery from street view data via a
convolutional neural network, and 2) the NDVI remote sensing images. Single and
multiple mediation analyses with multilevel regressions were conducted.
Streetscape and NDVI greenery were weakly and positively, but not
significantly, correlated. Our regression results revealed that streetscape
greenery and NDVI were, individually and jointly, positively associated with
mental wellbeing. Significant partial mediators for the streetscape greenery
were physical activity, stress, air quality and noise, and social cohesion;
together, they explained 62% of the association. For NDVI, only physical
activity and social cohesion were significant partial mediators, accounting for
22% of the association. Mental health and wellbeing and both streetscape and
satellite-derived greenery seem to be both directly correlated and indirectly
mediated. Our findings signify that both greenery measures capture different
aspects of natural environments and may contribute to people's wellbeing by
means of different mechanisms.

light-matter interaction. Depending on the couplings of the internal degrees of
freedom, relaxation can be ultrafast, converting electronic energy in a few fs,
or slow, if the energy is trapped in a metastable state that decouples from its
environment. Here, helium nanodroplets are resonantly excited by femtosecond
extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) pulses from a seeded free-electron laser. Despite
their superfluid nature, we find that helium nanodroplets in the lowest
electronically excited states undergo ultrafast relaxation. By comparing
experimental photoelectron spectra with time-dependent density functional
theory simulations, we unravel the full relaxation pathway: Following an
ultrafast interband transition, a void nanometer-sized bubble forms around the
localized excitation (He*) within 1 ps. Subsequently, the bubble collapses and
releases metastable He* at the droplet surface. This study highlights the high
level of detail achievable in probing the photodynamics of nanosystems using
tunable XUV pulses.

Analysis of the detailed structure of the coding space of the families revealed
a rugged landscape, with many local energy minima of varying sizes with a

population of interest and by hierarchically ordering the query space, we
propose a Decision tree-based Thompson sampler (\texttt{DT-TMP}) that
efficiently discovers the right combination of attributes to query. Our
proposed sampler outperforms the state-of-the-art samplers in online

inequalities is a well-established concept. The variational inequality (VI) is
a static problem which is studied under dynamical settings using a framework
called the projected dynamical system, whose stationary points coincide with
the static solutions of the associated VI. VI has rich properties concerning
the monotonicity of its vector-valued map and the uniqueness of its solution,
which can be extended to convex optimization and saddle-point problems.
Moreover, these properties also extend to the representative projected
dynamical system. The objective of this paper is to harness rich monotonicity
properties of the representative projected dynamical system to develop the
solution concepts of the convex optimization problem and the associated
saddle-point problem. To this end, this paper studies a linear inequality
constrained convex optimization problem and models its equivalent saddle-point
problem as a VI. Further, the VI is studied as a projected dynamical
system\cite{friesz1994day} which is shown to converge to the saddle-point
solution. By considering the monotonicity of the gradient of Lagrangian
function as a key factor, this paper establishes exponential convergence and
stability results concerning the saddle-points. Our results show that the
gradient of the Lagrangian function is just monotone on the Euclidean space,
leading to only Lyapunov stability of stationary points of the projected
dynamical system. To remedy the situation, the underlying projected dynamical

research due to the continuous increase in the number of object categories. It
tries to answer the pertinent question: given a test sample, should we even try
to classify it? We propose a novel solution using the concept of mixup
technique for novelty detection, termed as Segregation Network. During
training, a pair of examples are selected from the training data and an
interpolated data point using their convex combination is constructed. We
develop a suitable loss function to train our model to predict its constituent
classes. During testing, each input query is combined with the known class
prototypes to generate mixed samples which are then passed through the trained
network. Our model which is trained to reveal the constituent classes can then
be used to determine whether the sample is novel or not. The intuition is that
if a query comes from a known class and is mixed with the set of known class
prototypes, then the prediction of the trained model for the correct class
should be high. In contrast, for a query from a novel class, the predictions
for all the known classes should be low. The proposed model is trained using
only the available known class data and does not need access to any auxiliary
dataset or attributes. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, namely
Caltech 256 and Stanford Dogs and comparisons with the state-of-the-art
algorithms justifies the usefulness of our approach.

objectives: vanishing time-average regret and non-vanishing step sizes. This
phenomenon, that we coin ``fast and furious"" learning in games, sets a new
benchmark about what is possible both in max-min optimization as well as in
multi-agent systems. Our analysis does not depend on introducing a carefully
tailored dynamic. Instead we focus on the most well studied online dynamic,
gradient descent. Similarly, we focus on the simplest textbook class of games,
two-agent two-strategy zero-sum games, such as Matching Pennies. Even for this
simplest of benchmarks the best known bound for total regret, prior to our
work, was the trivial one of $O(T)$, which is immediately applicable even to a
non-learning agent. Based on a tight understanding of the geometry of the
non-equilibrating trajectories in the dual space we prove a regret bound of
$\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ matching the well known optimal bound for adaptive step
sizes in the online setting. This guarantee holds for all fixed step-sizes
without having to know the time horizon in advance and adapt the fixed
step-size accordingly. As a corollary, we establish that even with fixed
learning rates the time-average of mixed strategies, utilities converge to
their exact Nash equilibrium values.

multiple data sets might be sufficient to train one deep learning model,
thereby improving its performance. To do so, we trained an identical feature
extractor for all data, and the extracted features were fed into corresponding
Softmax classifiers. Spectral knowledge was introduced to ensure that the
shared features were similar across domains. Four hyperspectral data sets were
used in the experiments. We achieved higher classification accuracies on three
data sets (Pavia University, Pavia Center, and Indian Pines) and competitive
results on the Salinas Valley data compared with the baseline. Spectral
knowledge was useful to prevent the deep network from overfitting when the data
shared similar spectral response. The proposed method tested on two deep CNNs

the $\eta$ meson and $^3$$He$ nucleus has been performed at COSY accelerator in
Research Center J\""ulich in Germany with WASA-at-COSY facility.
  The excitation functions for $pd\rightarrow^3$$He2\gamma$,
$pd\rightarrow^3$$He6\gamma$, $pd\rightarrow ppp\pi^{-}$, $pd\rightarrow
ppn\pi^{0}$, $pd\rightarrow dn\pi^{-}$, $pd\rightarrow dp\pi^{0}$,
$pd\rightarrow pd$, and $pd\rightarrow ppn$ reactions have been measured in the
vicinity of the $\eta$ meson production threshold. The experiment was carried
out using COSY ramped proton beam and deuterium pellet target. The beam
momentum varied continuously in the range of $1.426-1.635~GeV/c$ corresponding
to $^3$$He-\eta$ excess energy range from $-70$ to $+30~MeV$.
  The analysis of the obtained excitation functions for the
$pd\rightarrow^3$$He\eta$ indicate slightly the signal from the bound state for
$\Gamma>20~MeV$ and $B\in[0;15]~MeV$. However, the observed indication is in
the range of the systematic error. Therefore the final conclusion of this
thesis is that no narrow structure that could be interpreted as $\eta$-mesic
nucleus was observed in both excitation curves. Thus, the upper limit for the
total cross section of the bound state formation was estimated assuming that
the $\eta$ decay branching ratios in the bound state is the same as in free
space. The upper limit at the $90\%$ confidence level varies from $2$ to
$15~nb$ within the binding energy range from $0$ to $60~MeV$ and the width from
$2.5$ to $40~MeV$.

Convolutional neural networks can naturally operate on images, but have
significant challenges in dealing with graph data. Given images are special
cases of graphs with nodes lie on 2D lattices, graph embedding tasks have a
natural correspondence with image pixel-wise prediction tasks such as
segmentation. While encoder-decoder architectures like U-Nets have been
successfully applied on many image pixel-wise prediction tasks, similar methods
are lacking for graph data. This is due to the fact that pooling and
up-sampling operations are not natural on graph data. To address these
challenges, we propose novel graph pooling (gPool) and unpooling (gUnpool)
operations in this work. The gPool layer adaptively selects some nodes to form
a smaller graph based on their scalar projection values on a trainable
projection vector. We further propose the gUnpool layer as the inverse
operation of the gPool layer. The gUnpool layer restores the graph into its
original structure using the position information of nodes selected in the
corresponding gPool layer. Based on our proposed gPool and gUnpool layers, we
develop an encoder-decoder model on graph, known as the graph U-Nets. Our

demonstrate that our methods achieve consistently better performance than

semi-continuous energies on Wasserstein space, of cost minimizing mass
transports, as well as many other couplings between probability measures to
which Monge-Kantorovich theory does not readily apply. Basic examples include
balayage of measures, martingale transports, optimal Skorokhod embeddings, and
the weak mass transports of Talagrand, Marton, Gozlan and others. The class
also includes various stochastic mass transports such as the Schr\""odinger
bridge associated to a reversible Markov process, and the Arnold-Brenier
variational principle for the incompressible Euler equations. We associate to
most linear transfers, a critical constant, a corresponding effective linear
transfer and additive eigenfunctions to their dual Kantorovich operators, that
extend Man\'e's critical value, Aubry-Mather invariant tori, and Fathi's weak
KAM solutions for Hamiltonian systems. This amounts to studying the asymptotic
properties of the nonlinear Kantorovich operators as opposed to classical
ergodic theory, which deals with linear Markov operators. This allows for the
extension of Mather theory to other settings such as its stochastic
counterpart. We also introduce the class of convex transfers, which includes
$p$-powers ($ p \geq 1$) of linear transfers, the logarithmic entropy, the
Donsker-Varadhan information, optimal mean field plans, and certain free
energies as functions of two probability measures, i.e., where the reference
measure is also a variable. Duality formulae for general transfer inequalities

shows how the densities of normal cells, tumor cells, and excess H+ ions change
with time due to both chemical reactions between these three populations and
density-dependent diffusion by which they spread out in three-dimensional
space. Moreover, it proposes that each cell has an optimal pH for survival;
that is, if the local pH deviates from the optimal value in either an acidic or
alkaline direction, the cells begin to die, and that the death rate saturates
at some maximum value when the microenvironment is extremely acidic or
alkaline. We have previously studied in detail how the death-rate functions of
the normal and tumor populations depend upon the H+ ion density [4]. Here, we
extend previous work by investigating how the equilibrium densities (at which
the time rates of change of the cellular densities are equal to zero) reached
by the normal and tumor populations in three-dimensional space are affected by
the presence of the H+ ions, and we present detailed analytical and
computational techniques to analyze the dynamical stability of these
equilibrium densities. For a sample set of biological input parameters and

shown vulnerable to adversarial example attacks. Specifically, once the
attackers obtain the deep model, they can construct adversarial examples to
mislead the model to yield wrong classification results. Deployable adversarial
examples such as small stickers pasted on the road signs and lanes have been
shown effective in misleading advanced driver-assistance systems. Many existing
countermeasures against adversarial examples build their security on the
attackers' ignorance of the defense mechanisms. Thus, they fall short of
following Kerckhoffs's principle and can be subverted once the attackers know
the details of the defense. This paper applies the strategy of moving target
defense (MTD) to generate multiple new deep models after system deployment,
that will collaboratively detect and thwart adversarial examples. Our MTD
design is based on the adversarial examples' minor transferability to models
differing from the one (e.g., the factory-designed model) used for attack
construction. The post-deployment quasi-secret deep models significantly
increase the bar for the attackers to construct effective adversarial examples.
We also apply the technique of serial data fusion with early stopping to reduce
the inference time by a factor of up to 5 while maintaining the sensing and
defense performance. Extensive evaluation based on three datasets including a
road sign image database and a GPU-equipped Jetson embedded computing board
shows the effectiveness of our approach.

observations and guided attention features. Detailed convergence analysis of
GAM is presented in this paper. We evaluate GAM-based navigation system in two
complex 3D environments. Experimental results show that the GAM-based
navigation system significantly improves learning efficiency and outperforms
all baselines in average success rate.

between left and right hemispheres of human brain. Inspired by this study, in
this paper, we propose a novel bi-hemispheric discrepancy model (BiHDM) to
learn the asymmetric differences between two hemispheres for
electroencephalograph (EEG) emotion recognition. Concretely, we first employ
four directed recurrent neural networks (RNNs) based on two spatial
orientations to traverse electrode signals on two separate brain regions, which
enables the model to obtain the deep representations of all the EEG electrodes'
signals while keeping the intrinsic spatial dependence. Then we design a
pairwise subnetwork to capture the discrepancy information between two
hemispheres and extract higher-level features for final classification.
Besides, in order to reduce the domain shift between training and testing data,
we use a domain discriminator that adversarially induces the overall feature
learning module to generate emotion-related but domain-invariant feature, which
can further promote EEG emotion recognition. We conduct experiments on three
public EEG emotional datasets, and the experiments show that the new
state-of-the-art results can be achieved.
