communication (VLC) ultra-small cell network consisting of multiple optical
angle-diversity transmitters, one multi-antenna RF access point (AP), and
multiple terminal devices. In the network, the optical transmitters play the
primary role and are responsible for delivering information and power over the
visible light, while the RF AP acts as a complementary power transfer system.
Thus, we propose a novel collaborative RF and lightwave resource allocation
scheme for hybrid RF/VLC ultra-small cell networks. The proposed scheme aims to
maximize the communication quality-of-service provided by the VLC under a
constraint of total RF and light energy harvesting performance, while keeping
illumination constant and ensuring health safety. This scheme leads to the
formulation of two optimization problems that correspond to the resource
allocation at the optical transmitters and the RF AP. Both problems are
optimally solved by appropriate algorithms. Moreover, we propose a closed-form
suboptimal solution with high accuracy to tackle the optical transmitters'
resource allocation problem, as well as an efficient semi-decentralized method.
Finally, simulation results illustrate the achievable performance of the
investigated system and the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.

one end of the transmission line as a mirror, and examine the reflection
spectrum of the probe field from the other end. Our calculation shows that when
a qubit is placed at the node of the standing wave formed by the incident and
reflected waves, even though it is considered to be decoupled from the field,
it results in large energy splitting in the spectral profile of a resonant

accumulates the resulting errors, and finetunes the model via a multi-path

prune an existing very deep CNN with acceptable time cost, negligible accuracy
drop, and no heuristic knowledge, or re-design a model which exerts higher

theory'' (DMBT), showing excellent agreement over the whole experimentally
accessible pressure regime. This paper focuses on the specific aspect of the
propagation of low-energy phonons. We report calculations of the phonon
mean-free path and phonon life time in liquid \he4 as a function of wave length
and pressure. Historically, the question was of interest for experiments of
quantum evaporation. More recently, there is interest in the potential use of
$^4$He as a detector for low-energy dark matter (K. Schulz and Kathryn M.
Zurek, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 117}, 121302 (2016)). While the mean free path of
long wave length phonons is large, phonons of intermediate energy can have a
short mean free path of the order of $\mu$m. Comparison of different levels of
theory indicate that reliable predictions of the phonon mean free path can be
made only by using the most advanced many--body method available, namely, DMBT.

with correlated sources, and MAC with Feedback (MAC-FB) with independent
messages. For the first problem, we identify a structure in the joint
probability distribution of discrete memoryless sources, and define a new
common information called ``conferencing common information"". We develop a
multi-user joint-source channel coding methodology based on structured mappings
to encode this common information efficiently and to transmit it over a MAC. We
derive a new set of sufficient conditions for this coding strategy using
single-letter information quantities for arbitrary sources and channel
distributions. Next, we make a fundamental connection between this problem and
the problem of communication of independent messages over three-user MAC-FB. In
the latter problem, although the messages are independent to begin with, they
become progressively correlated given the channel output feedback. Subsequent
communication can be modeled as transmission of correlated sources over MAC.
Exploiting this connection, we develop a new coding scheme for the problem. We
characterize its performance using single-letter information quantities, and
derive an inner bound to the capacity region. For both problems, we provide a
set of examples where these rate regions are shown to be optimal. Moreover, we
analytically prove that this performance is not achievable using random
unstructured random mappings/codes.

acid or base dopants at low temperatures has been a focus of intense research

diffraction that ammonium fluoride (NH4F) is a hydrogen-disordering agent for
the hydrogen-ordered ice VIII. Cooling its hydrogen-disordered counterpart ice
VII doped with 2.5 mol% ND4F under pressure leads to a hydrogen-disordered ice
VIII with ~31% residual hydrogen disorder illustrating the long-range
hydrogen-disordering effect of ND4F. The doped ice VII could be supercooled by
~20 K with respect to the hydrogen-ordering temperature of pure ice VII after
which the hydrogen-ordering took place slowly over a ~60 K temperature window.
These findings demonstrate that ND4F-doping slows down the hydrogen-ordering
kinetics quite substantially. The partial hydrogen order of the doped sample is
consistent with the antiferroelectric ordering of pure ice VIII. Yet, we argue
that local ferroelectric domains must exist between ionic point defects of
opposite charge. In addition to the long-range effect of NH4F-doping on
hydrogen-ordered water structures, the design principle of using topological
charges should be applicable to a wide range of other 'ice-rule' systems

based on constructing a class of universal ``value functions'' which integrate
the selection of items and prices offered.

the black hole is likely charged as it cuts through the magnetic field carried
by the neutron star, leaving a temporarily charged black hole after merger. The
unstable charged state of the remnant black hole rapidly neutralizes by
interacting with the surrounding plasma and photons, which we investigate in
first principle by numerically solving a coupled set of Boltzmann equations of
1+1 form for non-spinning BH background. The resulting basic picture is as
follows. Electrons and positrons are accelerated in the BH electric field,
which then lose energy to surrounding soft photons via Compton scattering; more
electrons and positrons will be created from pair production as the hard
photons colliding with soft photons, or through the Schwinger process in strong
electromagnetic fields. The cascade stops when the charged black hole accretes
enough opposite charges and becomes neutralized. We find that $\sim 10\%$

of leveraging the benefits of goal oriented requirements engineering (GORE)
techniques to business compliance management. This requires analyzing goal
models along with their semantics. However, most prominent goal modeling
frameworks have no means of capturing the semantics of goals (except what is
trivially conveyed by their nomenclature).
  Objective: In this paper, we propose the Annotation of Functional
Satisfaction Conditions and their Reconciliation (AFSCR) framework for doing
the same. The entire framework is presented with respect to i* modeling
constructs.
  Method: This is a semi-automated framework that requires analysts to annotate
individual goals with their immediate goal satisfaction conditions. The AFSCR
framework can then reconcile these satisfaction conditions for every goal and
verify whether the derived set of cumulative satisfaction conditions is in
harmony with the intended set of goal satisfaction conditions.
  Result: If the derived and intended sets of satisfaction conditions are in
conflict, the framework raises entailment and/or consistency flags. Whenever a
conflict is flagged, the framework also provides alternate solutions and
possible workaround strategies to the analysts by refactoring the given i*
model.
  Conclusion: In this paper we present a new framework that uses satisfaction
conditions for going beyond the nomenclature and capturing the functional
semantics of the goals within i* models. The analysis performed during the
reconciliation process is generic enough and can be adapted to any goal
modeling framework if required.

century world. Systems like Smart Grids, Transportation, and Healthcare help us
run our lives and businesses smoothly, successfully and safely. Since
malfunctions in these CPSs can have serious, expensive, sometimes fatal
consequences, System-Level Formal Verification (SLFV) tools are vital to
minimise the likelihood of errors occurring during the development process and
beyond. Their applicability is supported by the increasingly widespread use of
Model Based Design (MBD) tools. MBD enables the simulation of CPS models in
order to check for their correct behaviour from the very initial design phase.
The disadvantage is that SLFV for complex CPSs is an extremely time-consuming
process, which typically requires several months of simulation. Current SLFV
tools are aimed at accelerating the verification process with multiple
simulators that work simultaneously. To this end, they compute all the
scenarios in advance in such a way as to split and simulate them in parallel.
Furthermore, they compute optimised simulation campaigns in order to simulate
common prefixes of these scenarios only once, thus avoiding redundant
simulation. Nevertheless, there are still limitations that prevent a more
widespread adoption of SLFV tools. Firstly, current tools cannot optimise
simulation campaigns from existing datasets with collected scenarios. Secondly,
there are currently no methods to predict the time required to complete the
SLFV process. This lack of ability to predict the length of the process makes
scheduling verification activities highly problematic. In this thesis, we
present how we are able to overcome these limitations with the use of a

express the capacity of quiver data in terms of the character induced by

applications, from indication and display technologies to high-speed data

promise to advance solid-state lighting by delivering novel light sources.
However, electrical pumping of these devices is still a challenging problem.
Many wide-bandgap semiconductor materials, such as SiC, GaN, AlN, ZnS, and
Ga2O3, can be easily doped n-type, but their efficient p-type doping is
extremely difficult. The lack of holes due to the high activation energy of
acceptors greatly limits the performance and practical applicability of
wide-bandgap semiconductor devices. Here, we study a novel effect which allows
homojunction semiconductors devices, such as p-i-n diodes, to operate well
above the limit imposed by doping of the p-type material. Using a rigorous
numerical approach, we show that the density of injected holes can exceed the
density of holes in the p-type injection layer by up to three orders of
magnitude, which gives the possibility to significantly overcome the doping
problem. We present a clear physical explanation of this unexpected feature of
wide-bandgap semiconductor p-i-n diodes and closely examine it in 4H-SiC,
3C-SiC, AlN and ZnS structures. The predicted effect can be exploited to
develop bright light emitting devices, especially electrically driven

jointly addressed to support ultra-reliable and low latency communications

base station (MBS) and multiple overlaid small cell base stations (SBSs) is
considered that includes users with different latency and reliability
constraints. Modeling the latency and reliability constraints of users with
probabilistic guarantees, the joint problem of user offloading and resource
allocation (JUR) in a URLLC setting is formulated as an optimization problem to
minimize the cost of serving users for the MBS. In the considered scheme, SBSs
bid to serve URLLC users under their coverage at a given price, and the MBS
decides whether to serve each user locally or to offload it to one of the
overlaid SBSs. Since the JUR optimization is NP-hard, we propose a low
complexity learning-based heuristic method (LHM) which includes a support
vector machine-based user association model and a convex resource optimization
(CRO) algorithm. To further reduce the delay, we propose an alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based solution to the CRO problem.
Simulation results show that using LHM, the MBS significantly decreases the
spectrum access delay for users (by $\sim$ 93\%) as compared to JUR, while also
reducing its bandwidth and power costs in serving users (by $\sim$ 33\%) as
compared to directly serving users without offloading.

representative methods formulate it as a multi-label prediction problem by
learning the local appearance of image patches using CNNs. However, these
approaches inevitably make incorrect estimations for the ambiguous patches
affected by their neighborhood contexts. Inaccurate local estimates are likely
to bring in degraded performance when combining into a global prediction. To
address the above issues, we propose a contextual deep network for patch-based
illuminant estimation equipped with refinement. First, the contextual net with
a center-surround architecture extracts local contextual features from image
patches, and generates initial illuminant estimates and the corresponding color
corrected patches. The patches are sampled based on the observation that pixels
with large color differences describe the illumination well. Then, the
refinement net integrates the input patches with the corrected patches in
conjunction with the use of intermediate features to improve the performance.
To train such a network with numerous parameters, we propose a stage-wise
training strategy, in which the features and the predicted illuminant from
previous stages are provided to the next learning stage with more finer
estimates recovered. Experiments show that our approach obtains competitive

Model-constrained regularization is powerful for incorporating rich

introduce model errors and reduce the accuracy of TMP reconstruction.
Simultaneous adaptation of these parameters during TMP reconstruction, however,
is difficult due to their high dimensionality. We introduce a novel
model-constrained inference framework that replaces conventional physiological

low-dimensional generative factors. Using a variational auto-encoder (VAE) with
long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, we train the VAE decoder to learn the
conditional likelihood of TMP, while the encoder learns the prior distribution
of generative factors. These two components allow us to develop an efficient
algorithm to simultaneously infer the generative factors and TMP signals from
ECG data. Synthetic and real-data experiments demonstrate that the presented
method significantly improve the accuracy of TMP reconstruction compared with
methods constrained by conventional physiological models or without

exchange-correlation kernel, or (as in RPA+) by an additive local or semilocal

it is also accurate for the jellium surface. RPA+ often gives realistic total

H2 and N2, and thus RPA+ yields correct total energies even for
spin-unpolarized atoms with fractional spins and strong correlation, as in
stretched H2 or N2. However, RPA and RPA+ can be very wrong for spin-polarized
one-electron systems (especially for stretched H2+), and also for the

we propose a computationally efficient generalized RPA+ (gRPA+) that changes
RPA+ only for spin-polarized systems by making gRPA+ exact for all one-electron

densities of many meta-generalized gradent approximations are made
self-correlation free. By construction, gRPA+ does not degrade the exact RPA+
description of jellium. gRPA+ is found to greatly improve upon RPA and RPA+ for
the ionization energies and electron affinities of light atoms. Many versions
of RPA with an approximate exchange-correlation kernel fail to be exact for all

return detailed predictions on flow patterns, wall shear stresses, and pulse
wave propagation. However, their success heavily relies on tedious
pre-processing and calibration procedures that typically induce a significant
computational cost, thus hampering their clinical applicability. In this work
we put forth a machine learning framework that enables the seamless synthesis

models derived from first physical principles. We illustrate this new paradigm
by showing how one-dimensional models of pulsatile flow can be used to
constrain the output of deep neural networks such that their predictions
satisfy the conservation of mass and momentum principles. Once trained on noisy
and scattered clinical data of flow and wall displacement, these networks can
return physically consistent predictions for velocity, pressure and wall
displacement pulse wave propagation, all without the need to employ
conventional simulators. A simple post-processing of these outputs can also
provide a cheap and effective way for estimating Windkessel model parameters
that are required for the calibration of traditional computational models. The

show that Kerr nonlinear resonators can be used to achieve all-passive,

applications in photonic systems such as chip-scale LIDAR. A multi-port
nonlinear Fano resonator is used as an on-chip, all-optical router for

stringent limitations on the operating power range and transmission of a single

sample efficiency and generalization, learning an accurate dynamics model is
often challenging and requires substantial interaction with the environment. A
wide variety of domains have dynamics that share common foundations like the
laws of classical mechanics, which are rarely exploited by existing algorithms.
In fact, humans continuously acquire and use such dynamics priors to easily
adapt to operating in new environments. In this work, we propose an approach to
learn task-agnostic dynamics priors from videos and incorporate them into an RL
agent. Our method involves pre-training a frame predictor on task-agnostic
physics videos to initialize dynamics models (and fine-tune them) for unseen
target environments. Our frame prediction architecture, SpatialNet, is designed
specifically to capture localized physical phenomena and interactions. Our
approach allows for both faster policy learning and convergence to better

to make decisions and interact with the world, for tasks from recognizing a

neuroimaging methods of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography
(MEG) provide population measures of neural activity with millisecond precision
that allow us to study the temporal dynamics of cognitive processes. However,
multi-sensor M/EEG data is inherently high dimensional, making it difficult to
parse important signal from noise. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) or
""decoding"" methods offer vast potential for understanding high-dimensional
M/EEG neural data. MVPA can be used to distinguish between different conditions
and map the time courses of various neural processes, from basic sensory
processing to high-level cognitive processes. In this chapter, we discuss the
practical aspects of performing decoding analyses on M/EEG data as well as the
limitations of the method, and then we discuss some applications for
understanding representational dynamics in the human brain.

For a number of reasons the focus of this study has mostly been on the model,
in which instances are sampled uniformly at random from a set of formulas
satisfying some clear conditions, such as fixed density or the probability of a
clause to occur. However, some non-uniform distributions are also of
considerable interest. In this paper we consider Random 2-SAT problems, in
which instances are sampled from a wide range of non-uniform distributions.
  The model of random SAT we choose is the so-called configuration model, given
by a distribution $\xi$ for the degree (or the number of occurrences) of each
variable. Then to generate a formula the degree of each variable is sampled
from $\xi$, generating several \emph{clones} of the variable. Then 2-clauses
are created by choosing a random paritioning into 2-element sets on the set of
clones and assigning the polarity of literals at random.
  Here we consider the random 2-SAT problem in the configuration model for
power-law-like distributions $\xi$. More precisely, we assume that $\xi$ is
such that its right tail $F_{\xi}(x)$ satisfies the conditions
$W\ell^{-\alpha}\le F_{\xi}(\ell)\le V\ell^{-\alpha}$ for some constants $V,W$.
The main goal is to study the satisfiability threshold phenomenon depending on
the parameters $\alpha,V,W$. We show that a satisfiability threshold exists and
is determined by a simple relation between the first and second moments of
$\xi$.

images, has recently attracted increasing interest due to its huge application
potentials. Although many face related fields (e.g., face recognition and face
detection) have been well studied for many years, the existing datasets for
face parsing are still severely limited in terms of the scale and quality,
e.g., the widely used Helen dataset only contains 2,330 images. This is mainly
because pixel-level annotation is a high cost and time-consuming work,
especially for the facial parts without clear boundaries. The lack of accurate
annotated datasets becomes a major obstacle in the progress of face parsing
task. It is a feasible way to utilize dense facial landmarks to guide the
parsing annotation. However, annotating dense landmarks on human face
encounters the same issues as the parsing annotation. To overcome the above
problems, in this paper, we develop a high-efficiency framework for face
parsing annotation, which considerably simplifies and speeds up the parsing
annotation by two consecutive modules. Benefit from the proposed framework, we
construct a new Dense Landmark Guided Face Parsing (LaPa) benchmark. It
consists of 22,000 face images with large variations in expression, pose,
occlusion, etc. Each image is provided with accurate annotation of a
11-category pixel-level label map along with coordinates of 106-point
landmarks. To the best of our knowledge, it is currently the largest public

face shape and boundary priors, we propose a simple yet effective

quantization noise model for AN aided HDA system is established to make an
analysis of the secrecy performance of such systems. With the partial channel
knowledge of eavesdropper available, an approximate expression of secrecy rate
(SR) is derived. Then using this approximation formula, we propose a two-layer
alternately iterative structure (TLAIS) for optimizing digital precoder (DP) of
confidential message (CM), digital AN projection matrix (DANPM) and analog
precoder (AP). The inner-layer iteration loop is to design the DP of CMs and
DANPM alternatively given a fixed matrix of AP. The outer-layer iteration loop
is in between digital baseband part and analog part, where the former refers to
DP and DANPM, and the latter is AP. Then for a given digital part, we propose a
gradient ascent algorithm to find the vector of AP vector. Given a matrix of
AP, we make use of general power iteration (GPI) method to compute DP and

Simulation results show that the proposed TLAIS can achieve a better SR

demonstration approach to learn tasks. The learnt task is corrected and
generalized using two layers of evaluation/modification. First, the robot
self-evaluates its performance and corrects the performance to be closer to the
demonstrated task. Then, coaching is used as a means to extend the policy
learnt to be adaptable to varying task goals. Both the self-evaluation and
coaching are implemented using reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Coaching is
achieved through human feedback on desired goal and action modification to
generalize to specified task goals. The proposed approach is evaluated with a
scooping task, by presenting a single demonstration. The self-evaluation
framework aims to reduce the resistance to scooping in the media. To reduce the
search space for RL, we bootstrap the search using least resistance path
obtained using resistive force theory. Coaching is used to generalize the
learnt task policy to transfer the desired quantity of material. Thus, the
proposed method provides a framework for learning tasks from one demonstration

understanding galaxy formation from cosmic dawn. There has been considerable
debate on whether Schechter-like LFs (characterized by an exponential drop-off
at the bright end) that well describe the LF in our local Universe are also a
sufficient description of the LF at high redshifts ($z>6$). We model the UVLF
over cosmic history with a semi-empirical framework and include a log-normal
scatter, $\Sigma$, in galaxy luminosities with a conditional luminosity
function approach. We show that stochasticity induces a flattening or a
feedback scale in the median galaxy luminosity versus halo mass relation,
$L_{c}(M_{h})$ to account for the increase of bright objects placed in lower
mass halos. We observe a natural broadening in the bright-end exponential
segment of the UVLF for $z>6$ if processes that regulate star-formation acts on
the same mass scale as at $z\sim5$, where the degree of broadening is enhanced
for larger $\Sigma$. Alternatively, if the bright-end feedback is triggered at
a near-constant luminosity threshold, the feedback threshold occurs at
progressively lower halo masses with increasing redshift, due to galaxies being
more luminous on average at a fixed halo mass from rapid halo assembly. Such
feedback results in a LF shape with a bright-end closer to that of a Schechter
function. We include predictions for the $z>8$ UVLFs from future all-sky
surveys such as WFIRST which has the potential to both quantify the scatter and
type of feedback, and provide insight behind the mechanisms that drive star
formation in the early Universe.

rotating stellar-mass BH surrounded by a hyperaccretion disk might be born in
the center of a massive core collapsar. In the initial hundreds of seconds of
the accretion process, the mass supply rate of the massive progenitor is
generally higher than the ignition accretion rate, but the jets are generally
choked in the envelope. Thus, neutrinos can be emitted from the center of a
core collapsar. In this paper, we study the effects of the masses and
metallicities of progenitor stars on the time-integrated spectra of electron
neutrinos from NDAFs. The peak energies of the calculated spectra are
approximately 10-20 MeV. The mass of a collapsar has little influence on the
neutrino spectrum, and a low metallicity is beneficial to the production of
low-energy ($\lesssim$ 1 MeV) neutrinos. We also investigate the differences in
the electron neutrino spectra between NDAFs and proto-neutron stars. Combining
with the electromagnetic counterparts and multi-messenger astronomy, one may
verify the possible remnants of the core collapse of massive stars with future

even if a narrow-uniform jet is presented in the prompt emission phase. We
estimate the jet structure in the afterglow phase under the situation that a
narrow-uniform-precessing jet is launched from the central engine of gamma-ray
burst. With different precession angles, it is found that the structured jet
can be roughly described as follows: a narrow uniform core with power-law wings
and sharp cut-off edges, a Gaussian profile, a ring shape, or other complex
profile in energy per solid angle. Correspondingly, the afterglows for our
obtained structured jets are also estimated. We find that the estimates of the
intrinsic kinetic energy, the electron index, and the jet opening angle based
on the afterglows formed in a precessing system may be incorrect. Our obtained

that the log realized volatility time series of major stock indices have the

an overlooked estimation error of latent volatility often results in an

representations robust to such changes. To address this issue, we propose a
Transferred Single and Couple Representation Learning Network (TSCN). Its
merits are two aspects: 1) Due to the lack of labelled training samples,
existing G-ReID methods mainly rely on unsatisfactory hand-crafted features. To
gain the superiority of deep learning models, we treat a group as multiple
persons and transfer the domain of a labeled ReID dataset to a G-ReID target

couple representation between two group members, that achieves more
discriminative power in G-ReID tasks. In addition, an unsupervised weight

discussion in the literature on whether AOUPs can be in equilibrium for
particular interaction potentials and how far from equilibrium they are in the
limit of small persistence time. By using a theorem on the time reversed form
of the AOUP Langevin-Ito equations, I prove that they have an equilibrium
probability density invariant under time reversal if and only if their smooth
interaction potential has zero third derivatives. In the limit of small
persistence Ornstein-Uhlenbeck time $\tau$, a Chapman-Enskog expansion of the
Fokker-Planck equation shows that the probability density has a local
equilibrium solution in the particle momenta modulated by a reduced probability
density that varies slowly with the position. The reduced probability density
satisfies a continuity equation in which the probability current has an
asymptotic expansion in powers of $\tau$. Keeping up to $O(\tau)$ terms, this
equation is a diffusion equation, which has an equilibrium stationary solution
with zero current. However, $O(\tau^2)$ terms contain fifth and sixth order
spatial derivatives and the continuity equation no longer has a zero current
stationary solution. The expansion of the overall stationary solution now
contains odd terms in the momenta, which clearly shows that it is not an

collective motion network based on physically-interpretable dynamical

motion classification. Using a ballgame as an example, we classified the
strategic collective motions in different global behaviours and discovered
that, in addition to the physical properties, the contextual node information

high-quality prediction performance, we propose to first adopt the empirical
mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble EMD (EEMD) methods to decompose the
original time series into high- and low-frequency components. The low-frequency
components can be easily predicted directly through traditional neural network
(NN) methods. It is more difficult to predict high-frequency components due to
their properties of weak mathematical regularity. To take advantage of the
inherent self-similarities within high-frequency components, these components
will be divided into several continuous small (overlapping) segments. The
grouped segments with high similarities are then selected to form more proper
training datasets for traditional NN methods. This regrouping strategy can
assist in enhancing the prediction accuracy of high-frequency components. The
final prediction result is obtained by integrating the predicted high- and
low-frequency components. Our proposed three-step prediction frameworks benefit
from the time series decomposition and similar segments grouping. Experiments
on both port cargo throughput and vessel traffic flow have illustrated its

processing and information retrieval techniques, visual question answering
(VQA), which aims to answer questions about an image or a video, has received
lots of attentions over the past few years. Although some progress has been
achieved so far, several studies have pointed out that current VQA models are
heavily affected by the \emph{language prior problem}, which means they tend to
answer questions based on the co-occurrence patterns of question keywords
(e.g., how many) and answers (e.g., 2) instead of understanding images and
questions. Existing methods attempt to solve this problem by either balancing
the biased datasets or forcing models to better understand images. However,
only marginal effects and even performance deterioration are observed for the
first and second solution, respectively. In addition, another important issue
is the lack of measurement to quantitatively measure the extent of the language
prior effect, which severely hinders the advancement of related techniques.
  In this paper, we make contributions to solve the above problems from two
perspectives. Firstly, we design a metric to quantitatively measure the
language prior effect of VQA models. The proposed metric has been demonstrated
to be effective in our empirical studies. Secondly, we propose a regularization
method (i.e., score regularization module) to enhance current VQA models by
alleviating the language prior problem as well as boosting the backbone model
performance. The proposed score regularization module adopts a pair-wise
learning strategy, which makes the VQA models answer the question based on the
reasoning of the image (upon this question) instead of basing on
question-answer patterns observed in the biased training set. The score

sheared current velocity, which has the method of the shearing modes or the
so-called non-modal approach as its foundation, is developed. The developed
theory predicts that in the Hall plasma with the inhomogeneous electric field,
the separate spatial Fourier mode of the perturbations is determined in the
frame convected with one of the plasma components. Because of the different
shearing of the ion and electron flows in the Hall plasma, this mode is
perceived by the second component as the Doppler-shifted continuously sheared
mode with time-dependent wave numbers. Due to this effect, the interaction of
the plasma components forms the nonmodal time-dependent process, which should
be investigated as the initial value problem. The developed approach is applied
to the solutions of the linear initial value problems for the hydrodynamic
modified two-stream instability and the kinetic ion-sound instability of the
plasma with a sheared Hall current with a uniform velocity shear. These
solutions reveal that the uniform part of the current velocity is responsible
for the modal evolution of the instability, whereas the current velocity shear
is the source of the development of the nonmodal instability with exponent
growing with time as $\sim\left(t-t_0\right)^3$.

obtained is found to obey various the scaling relation in terms of the fractal
dimension $d_f^B$ of the backbone, whereas the deterministic BTW model, on the

filtering techniques to disentangle bulk from turbulent motions in
non-radiative high-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters using
the cosmological hydro code ENZO. We find that the radial behavior of the ratio
of non-thermal pressure to total gas pressure as a function of cluster-centric
distance can be described by a simple polynomial function. The typical
non-thermal pressure support in the centre of clusters is $\sim$5%, increasing
to $\sim$15% in the outskirts, in line with the pressure excess found in recent
X-ray observations. While the complex dynamics of the ICM makes it impossible
to reconstruct a simple correlation between turbulent motions and hydrostatic
bias, we find that a relation between them can be established using the median
properties of a sample of objects. Moreover, we estimate the contribution of
radial accelerations to the non-thermal pressure support and conclude that it
decreases moving outwards from 40% (in the core) to 15% (in the cluster's
outskirts). Adding this contribution to one provided by turbulence, we show
that it might account for the entire observed hydrostatic bias in the innermost

  Localizable Features","Accepted at ICCV 2019 (oral talk). 14 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Regional dropout strategies have been proposed to enhance the performance of
convolutional neural network classifiers. They have proved to be effective for
guiding the model to attend on less discriminative parts of objects (e.g. leg
as opposed to head of a person), thereby letting the network generalize better
and have better object localization capabilities. On the other hand, current
methods for regional dropout remove informative pixels on training images by
overlaying a patch of either black pixels or random noise. Such removal is not
desirable because it leads to information loss and inefficiency during
training. We therefore propose the CutMix augmentation strategy: patches are
cut and pasted among training images where the ground truth labels are also
mixed proportionally to the area of the patches. By making efficient use of
training pixels and retaining the regularization effect of regional dropout,
CutMix consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art augmentation strategies on
CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, as well as on the ImageNet
weakly-supervised localization task. Moreover, unlike previous augmentation
methods, our CutMix-trained ImageNet classifier, when used as a pretrained
model, results in consistent performance gains in Pascal detection and MS-COCO
image captioning benchmarks. We also show that CutMix improves the model
robustness against input corruptions and its out-of-distribution detection
performances. Source code and pretrained models are available at

estimate of the commonly made assumption that the high-density part of the EOS
is best constrained when measuring the radius of the most massive, albeit rare,
neutron stars with masses $M\gtrsim2.1\,M_\odot$. At the same time, we find
that radius measurements of neutron stars with masses
$M\simeq1.7-1.85\,M_\odot$ can provide the strongest constraints on the
low-density part of the EOS. Finally, we quantify how radius measurements by
future missions can further improve our understanding of the EOS of matter at

Raman shifts characterizing vibrations and photoluminescence signals under UV

deliver a new microstructural interpretation of the increasing

Competitive performance can be also achieved by transferring to ImageNet. As a

drone's mobility cause degradation of beam forming algorithm performance. Then,
we propose a DoA estimation algorithm and a steering vector adaptive receiving
beam forming method. The DoA estimation algorithm is of high precision with low
computational complexity. Also it enables a beam former to timely adjust

show higher SINR performance and more stability of proposed method than

independent of the laser wavelength $\lambda_{\rm las}$. One condition for this
manifestation of ""limited similarity"" is that the electron density $n_{\rm e}$
is highly subcritical, so that the plasma does not affect the laser. The
freedom to choose a convenient laser wavelength can be useful in experiments
and simulations. In simulations, an up-scaled wavelength (and, thus, a coarser
mesh and larger time steps) reduces the computational effort, while limited
similarity ensures that the overall structure and evolutionary phases of the
wake channel are preserved. In our demonstrative example, we begin with a
terrawatt$\cdot$picosecond pulse from a ${\rm CO}_2$ laser with $\lambda_{\rm

center of a sub-millimeter-sized focal spot. The laser is shot into a sparse

tesla-scale magnetic field. Limited similarity is demonstrated in 2D for
$4\,\mu{\rm m} \leq \lambda_{\rm las} \leq 40\,\mu{\rm m}$ and is expected to
extend to shorter wavelengths. Assuming that this limited similarity also holds

In an iterative process, the center sends comparison queries to voters,

process which candidates stand a chance of winning and which do not.
Consequently, strategic voters might attempt to manipulate by deviating from
their true preferences and instead submit a different response in order to
attempt to maximize their profit. We provide a practical algorithm for
strategic voters which computes the best manipulative vote and maximizes the
voter's selfish outcome when such a vote exists. We also provide a careful
voting center which is aware of the possible manipulations and avoids
manipulative queries when possible. In an empirical study on four real-world
domains, we show that in practice manipulation occurs in a low percentage of

reduces manipulation even further, thus allowing for a non-distorted group

balance between pressure, Coriolis, buoyancy and Lorentz forces, with marginal
contributions from inertia and viscous forces. Current numerical simulations of
the geodynamo, however, operate at much larger inertia and viscosity because of
computational limitations. This casts some doubt on the physical relevance of
these models. Our work aims at finding dynamo models in a moderate
computational regime which reproduce the leading-order force balance of the
Earth. By performing a systematic parameter space survey with Ekman numbers in
the range $10^{-6} \leq E \leq 10^{-4}$, we study the variations of the force
balance when changing the forcing (Rayleigh number, $Ra$) and the ratio between
viscous and magnetic diffusivities (magnetic Prandtl number, $Pm$). For
dipole-dominated dynamos, we observe that the force balance is structurally
robust throughout the investigated parameter space, exhibiting a
quasi-geostrophic (QG) balance (balance between Coriolis and pressure forces)
at zeroth order, followed by a first-order MAC balance between the ageostrophic
Coriolis, buoyancy and Lorentz forces. At second order this balance is
disturbed by contributions from inertia and viscous forces. Dynamos with a
different sequence of the forces, where inertia and/or viscosity replace the
Lorentz force in the first-order force balance, can only be found close to the
onset of dynamo action and in the multipolar regime. Our study illustrates that
most classical numerical dynamos are controlled by a QG-MAC balance, while
cases where viscosity and inertia play a dominant role are the exception rather
than the norm.

invariant (permutation of the nodes of the input graph does not affect the
output) or equivariant (permutation of the input permutes the output). In this
paper, we consider a specific class of invariant and equivariant networks, for
which we prove new universality theorems. More precisely, we consider networks
with a single hidden layer, obtained by summing channels formed by applying an
equivariant linear operator, a pointwise non-linearity and either an invariant
or equivariant linear operator. Recently, Maron et al. (2019) showed that by
allowing higher-order tensorization inside the network, universal invariant
GNNs can be obtained. As a first contribution, we propose an alternative proof
of this result, which relies on the Stone-Weierstrass theorem for algebra of
real-valued functions. Our main contribution is then an extension of this
result to the equivariant case, which appears in many practical applications
but has been less studied from a theoretical point of view. The proof relies on
a new generalized Stone-Weierstrass theorem for algebra of equivariant
functions, which is of independent interest. Finally, unlike many previous
settings that consider a fixed number of nodes, our results show that a GNN
defined by a single set of parameters can approximate uniformly well a function

55197-55286) including the period of multi-wavelength flaring activity detected
from the source around February 16-17, 2010 (MJD 55243-55244). We also use near
simultaneous optical and radio flux measurements from SPOL in V and R bands and
OVRO at 15 GHz respectively. We find that the emissions in the optical and
radio bands do not show any significant change in the source activity unlike at
X-ray and $\gamma$--ray energies during the outburst. The optical and radio
flux measurements are found to be consistent with the long term quiescent state
emission of the source. Moreover, the linear polarization in the wavelength
range 500-700 nm decreases to a minimum value of 1.6$\%$ during the X-ray and
$\gamma$--ray outburst which is significantly lower than the long term average
value of $\sim$ 4.2$\%$. The angle of polarization varies between
114$^\circ$-163$^\circ$ with a preferred average value of $\sim$ 137$^\circ$
during this period. We estimate the degree of polarization intrinsic to the jet
taking into account the host galaxy contamination in R band and compare this
with the theoretical synchrotron polarization estimated for a power law
distribution of relativistic electrons gyrating in an emission region filled
with ordered and chaotic magnetic fields. The intrinsic linear polarization
estimated for different epochs during the above period is found to be
consistent with the theoretical synchrotron polarization produced by the
relativistic electrons with power law spectral index $\sim$ 2.2.

operator. At the same time, recent works have shown that recommendations of
popular content apps are responsible for a significant percentage of users
requests. As a result, some very recent works have considered how to nudge
recommendations to facilitate the network (e.g., increase cache hit rates). In
this paper, we follow up on this line of work, and consider the problem of
designing cache friendly recommendations for long viewing sessions;
specifically, we attempt to answer two open questions in this context: (i)
given that recommendation position affects user click rates, what is the impact
on the performance of such network-friendly recommender solutions? (ii) can the
resulting optimization problems be solved efficiently, when considering both
sequences of dependent accesses (e.g., YouTube) and position preference? To
this end, we propose a stochastic model that incorporates position-aware
recommendations into a Markovian traversal model of the content catalog, and
derive the average cost of a user session using absorbing Markov chain theory.
We then formulate the optimization problem, and after a careful sequence of
equivalent transformations show that it has a linear program equivalent and
thus can be solved efficiently. Finally, we use a range of real datasets we
collected to investigate the impact of position preference in recommendations
on the proposed optimal algorithm. Our results suggest more than 30\%
improvement with respect to state-of-the-art methods.

dielectric constant of SrTiO$_3\,$(STO) has been long studied. Those
fluctuations have been shown in recent years to be quantum critical and STO
demonstrated to form the archetypal quantum critical paraelectric. The effect
of those same fluctuations on the pressure and temperature dependence of the
ferroelectric soft phonon mode as the system is tuned away from criticality are
reported for the first time in this paper. We show that the mean field
approximation is confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, using a self-consistent
model of the quantum critical excitations including coupling to the volume
strain and without adjustable parameters, we determine logarithmic corrections
that would be observable only very close to the quantum critical point. Thus,
the mean-field character of the pressure dependence is much more robust to the
fluctuations than is the temperature dependence. We predict stronger
corrections for lower dimensionalities however. The same calculation confirms
that the Lydanne-Sachs-Teller relation is valid over the whole pressure and
temperature range considered. Therefore, the measured dielectric constant can
be used to extract the frequency of the soft mode down to 1.5 K and up to 20
kbar of applied pressure. The soft mode is observed to stiffen further, raising
the low-temperature energy gap and returning towards the expected shallow
temperature dependence of an optical mode. This behavior is consistent with the
existence of a quantum critical point on the pressure-temperature phase diagram
of STO, which applied pressure tunes the system away from. This work represents
the first experimental measurement of the stiffening of a soft phonon mode as a
system is tuned away from criticality, a potentially universal phenomenon
across a variety of phase transitions and systems in condensed matter physics.

proceeding, predicting fast-ion losses to sensitive plasma-facing components
and detectors is gaining significant interest. A common recipe to perform such
studies is to push a large population of marker particles along their equations
of motion, the trajectories randomized with Monte Carlo operators accounting
for Coulomb collisions, and to record possible intersections of the marker
trajectories with synthetic detectors or areas of interest in the first wall.
While straightforward to implement and easy to parallelize, this Forward Monte
Carlo (FMC) approach tends to suffer from poor statistics and error estimation
as the detector domain is often small: it is difficult to guess how to set up
the initial weights and locations of the markers for them to remain
representative of the source distribution, yet record enough hits to the
detector for good statistics. As an alternative, the FMC method can be replaced
with a so-called Backward Monte Carlo (BMC) algorithm. Instead of starting with
a given initial marker population, one starts from the end condition at the
detector and records how the hit probability evolves backwards in time. The
scheme eliminates the statistics issue present in the FMC scheme and may
provide more accurate and efficient simulations of fast-ion loss signals. The
purpose of this paper is to explain the BMC recipe in the fast-ion setting and
to discuss the associated nuances, especially how to negate artificial
diffusion. For illustration purposes, our numerical example considers a 1-D
stochastic harmonic oscillator as a mock-up of a charged particle.

also explore the mission capability to perform an in-depth survey into the
atmospheres of smaller planets, which may be enriched or secondary. Earth-sized
planets and Super-Earths with atmospheres heavier than H/He will be more
challenging to observe spectroscopically. However, by studying the time
required to observe ~110 Earth-sized/Super-Earths, we find that Ariel could
have substantial capability for providing in-depth observations of smaller
planets. Trade-offs between the number and type of planets observed will form a
key part of the selection process and this list of planets will continually
evolve with new exoplanet discoveries replacing predicted detections. The Ariel
target list will be constantly updated and the MRS re-selected to ensure
maximum diversity in the population of planets studied during the primary

laser deposition (IR-PLD) on different surfaces were investigated in order to
study the influence of the substrate, orientation, and thickness on their
magnetic behavior. Different single crystal (001)-oriented substrates, i.e.,
SrTiO3(001), MgAl2O4(001) and MgO(001), have been used for the preparation of
epitaxial Fe3O4(001) films. By comparison, polycrystalline magnetite films were
obtained on both single crystal Al2O3(0001) and amorphous Si/SiO2 substrates.
The thickness has been varied between 50 - 400 nm. All films consist of
nanocrystalline stoichiometric magnetite with very small strain (<1\%) and
present the Verwey transition (Tv) between 110-120 K, i.e., close to bulk
magnetite (122 K). In general, Tv depends on both microstructure and thickness,
increasing mainly as the thickness increases. Room temperature
angular-dependent measurements reveal an in-plane fourfold symmetry magnetic
behavior for all films grown on (001)-oriented surfaces, and with the easy axes
lying along the Fe3O4 [010] and [100] directions. Remarkably, the fourfold
magnetic symmetry shows up to 400 nm thick films. In turn, the films grown on
single crystal Al2O3 (0001) and on amorphous Si/SiO2 surfaces display an
isotropic magnetic behavior. Coercive field (Hc) depends on microstructure and
film thickness. The largest (lowest) Hc value corresponds to the thinner film
grown on a single crystal SrTiO3(001) (amorphous Si/SiO2) surface, which
present the largest (lowest) strain (crystallinity). Moreover, the coercivity
follows an inverse law with film thickness. Our results demonstrate that we can
artificially control the magnetic behavior of stoichiometric IR-PLD grown Fe3O4
films by exploiting substrate-induced anisotropy and thickness-controlled
coercivity, that might be relevant to incorporate magnetite in future
spintronic devices.

a singularity ring (SR) captures the degeneracy structure of generic

symmetry constraints and reduces their topological characterization to the
classification of simple intersection or winding behavior, as detailed by our
explicit study of chiral, sublattice, particle-hole and conjugated
particle-hole symmetries. In 1D, the winding number about the SR corresponds to
the band vorticity measurable through the Berry phase. In 2D, more complicated
winding behavior leads to a variety of phases that illustrate the richness of
the interplay between SR topology and geometry beyond mere Chern number
classification. Through a normalization procedure that puts generic 2-band
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians on equal footing, our SR approach also allows for
vivid visualization of the non-Hermitian skin effect.

gene family is a group of genes having evolved from a single ancestral gene. A
gene family evolves along the branches of a species tree through various
mechanisms, including - but not limited to - speciation, gene duplication, gene
loss, horizontal gene transfer. The reconstruction of a gene tree representing
the evolution of a gene family constrained by a species tree is an important
problem in phylogenomics. However, unlike in the multispecies coalescent
evolutionary model, very little is known about the search space for gene family
histories accounting for gene duplication, gene loss and horizontal gene
transfer (the DLT-model). We introduce the notion of evolutionary histories
defined as a binary ordered rooted tree describing the evolution of a gene
family, constrained by a species tree in the DLT-model. We provide formal
grammars describing the set of all evolutionary histories that are compatible
with a given species tree, whether it is ranked or unranked. These grammars
allow us, using either analytic combinatorics or dynamic programming, to
efficiently compute the number of histories of a given size, and also to
generate random histories of a given size under the uniform distribution. We
apply these tools to obtain exact asymptotics for the number of gene family
histories for two species trees, the rooted caterpillar and the complete binary
tree, as well as estimates of the range of the exponential growth factor of the
number of histories for random species trees of size up to 25. Our results show
that including horizontal gene transfer induce a dramatic increase of the
number of evolutionary histories. We also show that, within ranked species
trees, the number of evolutionary histories in the DLT-model is almost
independent of the species tree topology.

characteristic feature that, at increasing baryon density, the chiral symmetry
is restored within the hadronic phase by lifting the mass splitting between
chiral partner states (parity doubling), before quark deconfinement takes
place. At low temperature and finite baryon density, the model predicts a
first-, second-order chiral phase transition, or a crossover, depending on the
expectation value of the scalar field, and a first-order deconfinement phase
transition. We discuss two sets of free parameters, which result in
compact-star mass-radius relations that are at tension with the combined

are formed in each survey pointing. For each ofthe 222 beams, total intensity
is recorded at 491.52 us time resolution. Each observation integrates for 1 hr
and covers 2592 channels from 119 to 151 MHz. This instrumental setup allows
LOTAAS to reach a detection threshold of 1 to 5 mJy for periodic emission. Thus
far, the LOTAAS survey has resulted in the discovery of 73 radio pulsars. Among
these are two mildly recycled binary millisecond pulsars (P = 13 and 33 ms), as
well as the slowest-spinning radio pulsar currently known (P = 23.5 s). The
survey has thus far detected 311 known pulsars, with spin periods ranging from
4 ms to 5.0 s and dispersion measures from 3.0 to 217 pc/cc. Known pulsars are
detected at flux densities consistent with literature values. We find that the
LOTAAS pulsar discoveries have, on average, longer spin periods than the known
pulsar population. This may reflect different selection biases between LOTAAS
and previous surveys, though it is also possible that slower-spinning pulsars
preferentially have steeper radio spectra. LOTAAS is the deepest all-sky pulsar
survey using a digital aperture array; we discuss some of the lessons learned
that can inform the approach for similar surveys using future radio telescopes
such as the Square Kilometre Array.

two-dimensional (2D) projections of the intrinsically three-dimensional (3D)
structure of the clouds. In this study, we present a novel method for relating
the 2D projected fractal dimension ($\mathcal{D}_{\text{p}}$) to the 3D fractal
dimension ($\mathcal{D}_{\text{3D}}$) of turbulent clouds. We do this by
computing the fractal dimension of clouds over two orders of magnitude in
turbulent Mach number $(\mathcal{M} = 1-100)$, corresponding to seven orders of
magnitude in spatial scales within the clouds. This provides us with the data
to create a new empirical relation between $\mathcal{D}_{\text{p}}$ and
$\mathcal{D}_{\text{3D}}$. The proposed relation is
$\mathcal{D}_{\text{3D}}(\mathcal{D}_{\text{p}}) = \Omega_1 erfc ( \xi_1
erfc^{-1}[ (\mathcal{D}_{\text{p}} - \mathcal{D}_{\text{p,min}})/\Omega_2 ] +
\xi_2 ) + \mathcal{D}_{\text{3D,min}}$, where the minimum 3D fractal dimension,
$\mathcal{D}_{\text{3D,min}} = 2.06 \pm 0.35$, the minimum projected fractal
dimension, $\mathcal{D}_{\text{p,min}} = 1.55 \pm 0.13$, $\Omega_1 = 0.47 \pm
0.18$, $\Omega_2 = 0.22 \pm 0.07$, $\xi_1 = 0.80 \pm 0.18$ and $\xi_2 = 0.26
\pm 0.19$. The minimum 3D fractal dimension, $\mathcal{D}_{\text{3D,min}} =
2.06 \pm 0.35$, indicates that in the high $\mathcal{M}$ limit the 3D clouds
are dominated by planar shocks. The relation between $\mathcal{D}_{\text{p}}$
and $\mathcal{D}_{\text{3D}}$ of molecular clouds may be a useful tool for
those who are seeking to understand the 3D structures of molecular clouds,
purely based upon 2D projected data and shows promise for relating the physics
of the turbulent clouds to the fractal dimension.

within a frequency comb can be reconstructed from a heterodyne measurement
using a reference comb. In principle, following this approach, such retrieval
of optical phases appears possible, but should give rise to a temporally
constant signal. Instead, arXiv:1905.00668 provides experimental evidence for a
pronounced relative drift of the phases, which indicates that the modes of the
comb are not coherently phase-locked. This temporal drift can be explained if
the comb under test is not equidistant. This further means that the underlying
temporal waveform is not repetitive and cannot be compressed into a coherent
short pulse. This artifact severely hampers suggested applications of quantum
cascade lasers in precision metrology. Moreover, the notion of designating
multi-mode quantum cascade lasers as frequency combs appears questionable.

annotators, it is important to accurately estimate the reliability of
annotators. Annotators may provide labels of inconsistent quality due to their
varying expertise and reliability in a domain. Previous studies have mostly
focused on estimating each annotator's overall reliability on the entire
annotation task. However, in practice, the reliability of an annotator may
depend on each specific instance. Only a limited number of studies have
investigated modelling per-instance reliability and these only considered
binary labels. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised model which can handle
both binary and multi-class labels. It can automatically estimate the
per-instance reliability of each annotator and the correct label for each
instance. We specify our model as a probabilistic model which incorporates
neural networks to model the dependency between latent variables and instances.
For evaluation, the proposed method is applied to both synthetic and real data,
including two labelling tasks: text classification and textual entailment.
Experimental results demonstrate our novel method can not only accurately
estimate the reliability of annotators across different instances, but also
achieve superior performance in predicting the correct labels and detecting the
least reliable annotators compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

These materials show distinct Fe $L_{2,3}$ XAS and XMCD spectra, which are

Fe$^{3+}$ for Ca$_2$FeReO$_6$ and intermediate between Fe$^{2+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$

(Ca$^{2+}$/Ba$^{2+}$) substitution. For Ca$_2$FeReO$_6$, the powder-averaged Fe
spin moment along the field direction ($B = 5$ T), as probed by the XMCD
experiment, is strongly reduced in comparison with the spontaneous Fe moment
previously obtained by neutron diffraction, consistent with a scenario where
the magnetic moments are constrained to remain within an easy plane. For $B=1$
T, the unsaturated XMCD signal is reduced below $T_{MI}$ consistent with a
magnetic transition to an easy-axis state that further reduces the
powder-averaged magnetization in the field direction. For Ba$_2$FeReO$_6$, the
field-aligned Fe spins are larger than for Ca$_2$FeReO$_6$ ($B=5$ T) and the
temperature dependence of the Fe magnetic moment is consistent with the

serve as sensitive probes of the constancy of the electron-to-proton mass ratio
$\beta=m_e/m_p$. Since halo states are formed by resonant $s$-wave
interactions, their properties exhibit universal correlations that are fairly
independent of the interactions at short distances. For diatomic molecules,
these properties depend on a single parameter only, and so this `universality'
means that all the characteristics of a diatomic halo state can be determined
with high precision if only one parameter is accurately known. Furthermore,
this knowledge can be used to establish the respective property mass
sensitivities for investigating the stability of $\beta$. Here, we show for the
halo states of the helium dimers that the relationship between the probed
properties and their mass sensitivity can be derived from numerically exact
solutions of suitable radial Schr\""{o}dinger equations for a set of effective
potential energy curves. The resulting relations exhibit a weak dependence on
the short-range part of the used potentials and a near-negligible dependence on
the `higher-order' nonadiabatic, relativistic, QED and residual retardation
effects. The presented approach is thus a robust alternative to other
literature approaches, particularly in cases where a lack of experimental data

of a new methodology and corresponding toolbox for the extraction and

  The proposed approach processes craquelure network as a graph. The graph
representation captures the network structure via mutual organization of
junctions and fractures. Furthermore, it is invariant to any geometrical
distortions. At the same time, our tool extracts the properties of each node
and edge individually, which allows to characterize the pattern statistically.
  We illustrate benefits from the graph representation and statistical features
individually using novel Graph Neural Network and hand-crafted descriptors
correspondingly. However, we also show that the best performance is achieved
when both techniques are merged into one framework. We perform experiments on
the dataset for paintings' origin classification and demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing techniques by a large margin.

local spatial models on non-overlapping windows. Monte Carlo simulations were
used to gain additional insights into the asymptotic properties for finite

typical feature of many microbiological systems. In particular, the social
amoeba \textit{Disctyostelium discoideum} is widely used as a model organism,
but it is not still clear how it behaves in heterogeneous environments. A few
models focusing on mechanical features have already addressed the question;
however, we suggest that phenomenological models focusing on the population
dynamics may provide new meaningful data. Consequently, by means of a specific
Multi-agent system model, we study the dynamical features emerging from complex
social interactions among individuals belonging to amoeba colonies.\\ After
defining an appropriate metric to quantitatively estimate the gathering
process, we find that: a) obstacles play the role of local topological
perturbation, as they alter the flux of chemical signals; b) physical obstacles
(blocking the cellular motion and the chemical flux) and purely chemical
obstacles (only interfering with chemical flux) elicit similar dynamical
behaviors; c) a minimal program for robustly gathering simulated cells does not
involve mechanisms for obstacle sensing and avoidance; d) fluctuations of the
dynamics concur in preventing multiple stable clusters. Comparing those
findings with previous results, we speculate about the fact that chemotactic
cells can avoid obstacles by simply following the altered chemical gradient.
Social interactions are sufficient to guarantee the aggregation of the whole
colony past numerous obstacles.

high-energy electron dressed in the strong background electric field found
between the planes in a crystal. The strong crystalline field combined with
ultra relativistic electrons is one of very few cases where the Schwinger field
can be experimentally achieved in the electron's rest frame. The radiation
being emitted, the so-called channeling radiation, is a well studied
phenomenon. However only the first order diagram corresponding to emission of a
single photon has been studied so far. We elaborate on how the 2 photon
emission process should be understood in terms of a two-step versus a one-step
process, i.e., if one can consider one photon being emitted after the other, or
if there is also a contribution where the two photons are emitted
'simultaneously'. From the calculated full probability we see that the two-step
contribution is simply the product of probabilities for single photon emission
while the additional one-step terms are, mainly, interferences due to several
possible intermediate virtual states. These terms can contribute significantly
when the crystal is thin. Therefore, in addition, we see how one can, for a
thick crystal, calculate multiple photon emissions quickly by neglecting the
one-step terms, which represents a solution of the problem of quantum radiation
reaction in a crystal beyond the usually applied constant field approximation.
We explicitly calculate an example of 180 GeV electrons in a thin Silicon
crystal and argue why it is, for experimental reasons, more feasible to see the
one-step contribution in a crystal experiment than in a laser experiment.

large-scale channel gain with each of its associated ground base stations

provides the information on the large-scale channel gains between each GBS and
uniformly sampled locations on a three-dimensional (3D) grid over the region of
interest, which are assumed to be time-invariant due to the generally static
and large-size obstacles therein (e.g., buildings). Based on the given radio
maps of the GBSs, we first obtain the optimal UAV path by solving an equivalent
shortest path problem (SPP) in graph theory. To reduce the computation
complexity of the optimal solution, we further propose a grid quantization
method whereby the grid points in each GBS's radio map are more coarsely
sampled by exploiting the spatial channel correlation over neighboring grids.
Then, we solve the approximate SPP over the reduced-size radio map (graph) more
efficiently. Numerical results show that the proposed solutions can effectively
minimize the flying distance of the UAV subject to its communication quality
constraint. Moreover, a flexible trade-off between performance and complexity
can be achieved by adjusting the quantization ratio for the radio map.

today's object detection technique as a revolution driven by deep learning,
then back in the 1990s, we would see the ingenious thinking and long-term
perspective design of early computer vision. This paper extensively reviews
this fast-moving research field in the light of technical evolution, spanning
over a quarter-century's time (from the 1990s to 2022). A number of topics have
been covered in this paper, including the milestone detectors in history,
detection datasets, metrics, fundamental building blocks of the detection
system, speed-up techniques, and the recent state-of-the-art detection methods.

  market data",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since the inception of Bitcoin in 2008, cryptocurrencies have played an
increasing role in the world of e-commerce, but the recent turbulence in the
cryptocurrency market in 2018 has raised some concerns about their stability
and associated risks. For investors, it is crucial to uncover the dependence
relationships between cryptocurrencies for a more resilient portfolio
diversification. Moreover, the stochastic behavior in both tails is important,
as long positions are sensitive to a decrease in prices (lower tail), while
short positions are sensitive to an increase in prices (upper tail). In order
to assess both risk types, we develop in this paper a flexible copula model
which is able to distinctively capture asymptotic dependence or independence in
its lower and upper tails simultaneously. Our proposed model is parsimonious
and smoothly bridges (in each tail) both extremal dependence classes in the
interior of the parameter space. Inference is performed using a full or
censored likelihood approach, and we investigate by simulation the estimators'
efficiency under three different censoring schemes which reduce the impact of
non-extreme observations. We also develop a local likelihood approach to
capture the temporal dynamics of extremal dependence among two leading
cryptocurrencies. We here apply our model to historical closing prices of five
leading cryotocurrencies, which share most of the cryptocurrency market
capitalizations. The results show that our proposed copula model outperforms
alternative copula models and that the lower tail dependence level between most
pairs of leading cryptocurrencies -- and in particular Bitcoin and Ethereum --
has become stronger over time, smoothly transitioning from an asymptotic
independence regime to an asymptotic dependence regime in recent years, whilst
the upper tail has been relatively more stable overall at a weaker dependence
level.

In
luminosity-color diagrams, their X-ray behavior forms unexplained q-shaped
cycles. We proposed a framework where the innermost regions of the accretion
disk evolve as a response to variations imposed in the outer regions. These
variations lead not only to modifications of the inner disk accretion rate
$\dot m_{in}$ but also to the evolution of the transition radius $r_J$ between
two regions. The outermost region is a standard accretion disk (SAD), whereas
the innermost region is a jet-emitting disk (JED) where all the disk angular
momentum is carried away vertically by two self-confined jets. In the previous
papers of this series, it has been shown that such a configuration reproduces
the typical spectral properties of the five canonical XrB states. The aim of
this paper is now to replicate all X-ray spectra and radio emission observed
during GX 339-4 2010-2011 outburst. We use the 2T plasma code presented in
papers II and III, and design an automatic fitting procedure that gives the
parameters $(\dot m_{in},r_J)$ that best fit each X-ray spectrum. We use
RXTE/PCA X-ray data spread over 438 days, together with radio observations at 9
GHz (ATCA). We obtain the time distributions of $\dot m_{in}$ and $r_J$ that
uniquely reproduce the X-ray luminosity and the spectral shape of the whole
cycle. Using the classical self-absorbed jet synchrotron emission model, the
JED-SAD configuration reproduces also very satisfactorily the radio properties,
in particular the switch-off and -on events and the radio-X-ray correlation.
Within the JED-SAD framework, radio emission can be used to constrain the
underlying disk configuration. If this result is confirmed using other
outbursts from GX 339-4 or other X-ray binaries, then radio could be indeed
used as another means to indirectly probe disk physics.

formed well before the CO freeze-out stage (i.e., in the H2O-rich ice phase).
This joint experimental and computational investigation shows that the isomers,
n- and i-propanol (H3CCH2CH2OH and H3CCHOHCH3) and n- and i-propenol (H3CCHCHOH
and H3CCOHCH2), can be formed in radical-addition reactions starting from
propyne (H3CCCH) + OH at the low temperature of 10 K, where H3CCCH is one of
the simplest representatives of stable carbon chains already identified in the
interstellar medium (ISM). The resulting average abundance ratio of 1:1 for
n-propanol:i-propanol is aligned with the conclusions from the computational
work that the geometric orientation of strongly interacting species is
influential to the extent of which 'mechanism' is participating, and that an
assortment of geometries leads to an averaged-out effect. Three isomers of
propanediol are also tentatively identified in the experiments. It is also
shown that propene and propane (H3CCHCH2 and H3CCH2CH3) are formed from the
hydrogenation of H3CCCH. Computationally-derived activation barriers give
additional insight into what types of reactions and mechanisms are more likely
to occur in the laboratory and in the ISM. Our findings not only suggest that
the alcohols studied here share common chemical pathways and therefore can show
up simultaneously in astronomical surveys, but also that their extended
counterparts that derive from polyynes containing H3C(CC)nH structures may
exist in the ISM. Such larger species, like fatty alcohols, are the possible
constituents of simple lipids that primitive cell membranes on the early Earth
are thought to be partially composed of.

undergoing element and column updates. It is the main subroutine behind the
best algorithms for many dynamic problems whose complexity is not yet
well-understood, such as maintaining the largest eigenvalue, rank and
determinant of a matrix and maintaining reachability, distances, maximum
matching size, and $k$-paths/cycles in a graph. Understanding the complexity of
dynamic matrix inverse is a key to understand these problems.
  In this paper, we present (i) improved algorithms for dynamic matrix inverse
and their extensions to some incremental/look-ahead variants, and (ii) variants
of the Online Matrix-Vector conjecture [Henzinger et al. STOC'15] that, if
true, imply that these algorithms are tight. Our algorithms automatically lead
to faster dynamic algorithms for the aforementioned problems, some of which are
also tight under our conjectures, e.g. reachability and maximum matching size
(closing the gaps for these two problems was in fact asked by Abboud and V.
Williams [FOCS'14]). Prior best bounds for most of these problems date back to
more than a decade ago [Sankowski FOCS'04, COCOON'05, SODA'07; Kavitha
FSTTCS'08; Mucha and Sankowski Algorithmica'10; Bosek et al. FOCS'14].
  Our improvements stem mostly from the ability to use fast matrix
multiplication ``one more time'', to maintain a certain transformation matrix
which could be maintained only combinatorially previously (i.e. without fast
matrix multiplication). Oddly, unlike other dynamic problems where this
approach, once successful, could be repeated several times (``bootstrapping''),
our conjectures imply that this is not the case for dynamic matrix inverse and
some related problems. However, when a small additional ``look-ahead''
information is provided we can perform such repetition to drive the bounds down
further.

Bayesian approach, no direct comparison is available. In this work, we compare,
directly and systematically, the frequentist and Bayesian approaches to
quantifying uncertainties in direct nuclear reactions. Starting from identical
initial assumptions, we determine confidence intervals associated with the
elastic and the transfer process for both methods, which are evaluated against

frequentist approach is not as flexible as the Bayesian approach in exploring
parameter space and often ends up in a different minimum. We also show that the
two methods produce significantly different correlations. In the end, the

nonlinear neural network component. The nonlinear neural network component
allows for more model flexibility, the ability to learn and model nonlinear and

facility with several colliders in succession, culminates with a 100 TeV
proton-proton collider. It offers a vast new domain of exploration in particle
physics, with orders of magnitude advances in terms of Precision, Sensitivity
and Energy. The implementation plan foresees, as a first step, an Electroweak
Factory electron-positron collider. This high luminosity facility, operating
between 90 and 365 GeV centre-of-mass energy, will study the heavy particles of
the Standard Model, Z, W, Higgs, and top with unprecedented accuracy. The
Electroweak Factory $e^+e^-$ collider constitutes a real challenge to the
theory and to precision calculations, triggering the need for the development
of new mathematical methods and software tools. A first workshop in 2018 had
focused on the first FCC-ee stage, the Tera-Z, and confronted the theoretical
status of precision Standard Model calculations on the Z-boson resonance to the
experimental demands. The second workshop in January 2019, which is reported
here, extended the scope to the next stages, with the production of W-bosons
(FCC-ee-W), the Higgs boson (FCC-ee-H) and top quarks (FCC-ee-tt). In
particular, the theoretical precision in the determination of the crucial input
parameters, alpha_QED, alpha_QCD, M_W, m_t at the level of FCC-ee requirements
is thoroughly discussed. The requirements on Standard Model theory calculations
were spelled out, so as to meet the demanding accuracy of the FCC-ee
experimental potential. The discussion of innovative methods and tools for
multi-loop calculations was deepened. Furthermore, phenomenological analyses
beyond the Standard Model were discussed, in particular the effective theory
approaches. The reports of 2018 and 2019 serve as white papers of the workshop
results and subsequent developments.

oracles within the simulation framework we show that for some specific
algorithms, like the Deutsch-Jozsa and Simon's algorithms, there simply is no
advantage in terms of query complexity. This does not detract from the fact
that quantum query complexity provides examples of how a quantum computer can
be expected to behave, which in turn has proved useful for finding new quantum
algorithms outside of the oracle paradigm, where the most prominent example is
Shor's algorithm for integer factorization.

normalization layers are removed to avoid loss of high-frequency texture
details. Final obtained high resolution medical image are obtained using

gravitational-wave detections have all been constraining the rate of these
events, while the gravitational wave plus broadband electromagnetic coverage of
binary neutron star merger (GW170817) has also placed constraints on the
properties (mass and composition) of the merger ejecta. But uncertainties and
ambiguities in modeling the optical and infrared emission make it difficult to
definitively measure the distribution of heavy isotopes in these mergers. In
contrast, gamma rays emitted in the decay of these neutron-rich ejecta may
provide a more direct measurement of the yields. We calculate the gamma
production in remnants of neutron star mergers, considering two epochs: a
kilonova epoch, lasting about two weeks, and a much later epoch of tens and
hundreds of thousands of years after the merger. For the kilonova epoch, when
the expanding ejecta is still only partially transparent to gamma radiation, we
use 3D radiative transport simulations to produce the spectra. We show that the
gamma-ray spectra associated with beta- and alpha-decay provide a fingerprint
of the ejecta properties and, for a sufficiently nearby remnant, may be
detectable, even for old remnants. We compare our gamma spectra with the
potential detection limits of next generation detectors, including the Lunar

striking characteristics are abstracted or exaggerated in order to create a
humor or sarcasm effect. For numerous caricature related applications such as
attribute recognition and caricature editing, face parsing is an essential
pre-processing step that provides a complete facial structure understanding.
However, current state-of-the-art face parsing methods require large amounts of
labeled data on the pixel-level and such process for caricature is tedious and
labor-intensive. For real photos, there are numerous labeled datasets for face
parsing. Thus, we formulate caricature face parsing as a domain adaptation
problem, where real photos play the role of the source domain, adapting to the
target caricatures. Specifically, we first leverage a spatial transformer based
network to enable shape domain shifts. A feed-forward style transfer network is
then utilized to capture texture-level domain gaps. With these two steps, we
synthesize face caricatures from real photos, and thus we can use parsing
ground truths of the original photos to learn the parsing model. Experimental
results on the synthetic and real caricatures demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed domain adaptation algorithm. Code is available at:

to the eigenvectors of the corresponding Gram matrix determines the convergence
of the optimization during training. Such analyses also provide upper bounds on
the generalization error. We experimentally investigate the implications of
these results to deeper networks via embeddings. We regard the layers preceding
the final hidden layer as producing different representations of the input data
which are then fed to the two-layer model. We show that these representations
improve both optimization and generalization. In particular, we investigate
three kernel representations when fed to the final hidden layer: the Gaussian
kernel and its approximation by random Fourier features, kernels designed to
imitate representations produced by neural networks and finally an optimal
kernel designed to align the data with target labels. The approximated
representations induced by these kernels are fed to the neural network and the
optimization and generalization properties of the final model are evaluated and
compared.

going beyond a merely instrumentalist view of quantum mechanics. Even if we
cannot be sure that any particular realist interpretation describes the world
as it actually is, the investigation of possible realist interpretations helps
us to develop new physical ideas and better intuitions about the nature of
physical objects at the micro level. In this spirit, Paul Busch himself
pioneered the concept of ``unsharp quantum reality'', according to which there
is an objective non-classical indeterminacy---a lack of sharpness---in the
properties of individual quantum systems.
  We concur with Busch's motivation for investigating realist interpretations
of quantum mechanics and with his willingness to move away from classical
intuitions. In this article we try to take some further steps on this road. In
particular, we pay attention to a number of \textit{prima facie} implausible
and counter-intuitive aspects of realist interpretations of unitary quantum
mechanics. We shall argue that from a realist viewpoint, quantum contextuality
naturally leads to ``perspectivalism'' with respect to properties of spatially
extended quantum systems, and that this perspectivalism is important for making
relativistic covariance possible.

$f(q^2)$, the CLF results obtained via $\lbd=0$ and $\pm$ polarization states
of vector meson within the traditional type-I correspondence scheme are
inconsistent with each other; and moreover, the strict covariance of the matrix
element is violated due to the nonvanishing spurious contributions associated
with noncovariance. We further show that such two problems have the same origin
and can be resolved simultaneously by employing the type-II correspondence
scheme, which advocates an additional replacement $M\to M_0$ relative to the
traditional type-I scheme; meanwhile, the results of ${\cal F}(q^2)$ in the
standard light-front quark model~(SLF QM) are exactly the same as the valence

significant enough wave energy accumulation at the down-wind boundary. Since
this moment the ensemble of waves propagating against the wind starts its
formation. Also, the waves, propagation along the strait start to appear. The
wave system eventually reaches asymptotic stationary state in time, consisting
of two co-existing states: the first, self-similar wave ensemble, propagating

orthogonal to the wind direction and tending to slant against the wind at the
angle of 15 degrees closer to the wave turbulence origination shore line. These

actions, or options, to make decisions from a higher-dimensional perspective to
alleviate the sparse reward problem, one of the most challenging problems in
reinforcement learning. The majority of existing HRL algorithms require either
significant manual design with respect to the specific environment or enormous
exploration to automatically learn options from data. To achieve fast
exploration without using manual design, we devise a multi-goal HRL algorithm,
consisting of a high-level policy Manager and a low-level policy Worker. The
Manager provides the Worker multiple subgoals at each time step. Each subgoal
corresponds to an option to control the environment. Although the agent may
show some confusion at the beginning of training since it is guided by three
diverse subgoals, the agent's behavior policy will quickly learn how to respond
to multiple subgoals from the high-level controller on different occasions. By
exploiting multiple subgoals, the exploration efficiency is significantly
improved. We conduct experiments in Atari's Montezuma's Revenge environment, a
well-known sparse reward environment, and in doing so achieve the same
performance as state-of-the-art HRL methods with substantially reduced training
time cost.

interesting results of this study is the generation of ladder operators for
Morse potential. The operators are a representation of the shifting energy
levels of the states exhibited by the wavefunction. From this result, we
manipulate and deform the operators in such a way that it gives a
noncommutative property to promote noncommutative quantum mechanics (NCQM). The
resultant NC feature can be shown in the spatial coordinates and finally the
Hamiltonian. In this study, we consider two-dimensional Morse potential where
the ladder operators are in the form of the corresponding 2D Morse.

, namely radio waves and laser radiation. Michael Hippke [2] has pointed out
that it may be possible to use neutrinos or gravitational waves as signals.
Gravitational waves demand the command of the generation of very large scale
amounts of energy, Jackson and Benford [3]. This paper describes a beacon that
uses beamed neutrinos as the signal. Neutrinos, like gravitational waves, have
the advantage of extremely low extinction in the interstellar medium. To make
use of neutrinos an advanced civilization can use a gravitational lens as a
focus and amplifier. The lens can be a neutron star or a black hole. Using wave
optics one can calculate the advantage of gravitational lensing for
amplification of a beam and along the optical axis it is exceptionally large.
Even though the amplification is very large the dimeter of the beam is quite
small, less that a centimeter. This implies that a large constellation of
neutrino transmitters would have to enclose the local neutron star or black
hole to cover the sky. This means that such a beacon would have to be built by
a Kardashev Type II civilization.

nonconvex objectives (e.g. deep learning models), such as batch gradient
descent, stochastic gradient descent and stochastic variance reduced gradient
descent. Theory shows these optimization methods can converge by using an
unbiased gradient estimator. However, in practice biased gradient estimation
can allow more efficient convergence to the vicinity since an unbiased approach
is computationally more expensive. To produce fast convergence there are two
trade-offs of these optimization strategies which are between stochastic/batch,
and between biased/unbiased. This paper proposes an integrated approach which
can control the nature of the stochastic element in the optimizer and can
balance the trade-off of estimator between the biased and unbiased by using a
hyper-parameter. It is shown theoretically and experimentally that this
hyper-parameter can be configured to provide an effective balance to improve
the convergence rate.

on a transparent screen. The HUD has been used in airplanes and vehicles, and
it is usually placed in front of the operator's view. In the case of the
vehicle, the driver can see not only various information on the HUD but also
the backgrounds (driving environment) through the HUD. However, the projected
information on the HUD may interfere with the colors in the background because
the HUD is transparent. For example, a red message on the HUD will be less
noticeable when there is an overlap between it and the red brake light from the
front vehicle. As the first step to solve this issue, how to evaluate the
mutual interference between the information on the HUD and backgrounds is
important. Therefore, this paper proposes a method to evaluate the mutual
interference based on saliency. It can be evaluated by comparing the HUD part
cut from a saliency map of a measured image with the HUD image.

the fundamental frequencies of geodesic motion around rotating neutron stars

frequencies through a QPO model, they can be fit to the data to obtain
estimates of the three parameters describing the spacetime, namely the neutron
star mass, angular momentum and quadrupole moment. From these parameters we
derive information on the neutron star structure and equation of state. We
present a proof of principle of our method applied to pairs of kHz QPO

We identify the kHz QPOs with the azimuthal and the periastron precession

simulation in which humanity lives (if any) and how this affects simulation
termination risks. We firstly explore the question of what kind of simulation
in which humanity is most likely located based on pure theoretical reasoning.
We suggest a new patch to the classical simulation argument, showing that we
are likely simulated not by our own descendants, but by alien civilizations.
Based on this, we provide classification of different possible simulations and
we find that simpler, less expensive and one-person-centered simulations,
resurrectional simulations, or simulations of the first artificial general
intelligence's (AGI's) origin (singularity simulations) should dominate. Also,
simulations which simulate the 21st century and global catastrophic risks are
probable. We then explore whether the simulation could collapse or be
terminated. Most simulations must be terminated after they model the
singularity or after they model a global catastrophe before the singularity.
Undeniably observed glitches, but not philosophical speculations could result
in simulation termination. The simulation could collapse if it is overwhelmed
by glitches. The Doomsday Argument in simulations implies termination soon. We
conclude that all types of the most probable simulations except resurrectional
simulations are prone to termination risks in a relatively short time frame of
hundreds of years or less from now.

  System-on-Chips",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Linear models are regularly used for mapping cores to tiles in a chip.
System-on-Chip (SoC) design requires integration of functional units with
varying sizes, but conventional models only account for identical-sized cores.
Linear models cannot calculate the varying areas of cores in SoCs directly and
must rely on approximations. We propose using non-linear models: Semi-definite
programming (SDP) allows easy model definitions and achieves approximately 20%
reduced area and up to 80% reduced white space. As computational time is
similar to linear models, they can be applied, practically.

among the variables that a researcher is interested in causally affects the
route choice behavior of drivers. To our knowledge, there is limited literature
that consider the effects of various factors on route choice based on causal
inference.Yet, collecting data sets that are sensitive to the aforementioned
factors are challenging and the existing approaches usually take into account
only the general factors motivating drivers route choice behavior. To fill
these gaps, we carried out a study using Immersive Virtual Environment (IVE)
tools to elicit drivers' route choice behavioral data, covering drivers'
network familiarity, educationlevel, financial concern, etc, apart from
conventional measurement variables. Having context-aware, high-fidelity
properties, IVE data affords the opportunity to incorporate the impacts of
human related factors into the route choice causal analysis and advance a more
customizable research tool for investigating causal factors on path selection
in network routing. This causal analysis provides quantitative evidence to
support drivers' diversion decision.

tasks in speech processing and both achieve impressive performance thanks to
the recent advance in deep learning and large amount of aligned speech and text
data. However, the lack of aligned data poses a major practical problem for TTS
and ASR on low-resource languages. In this paper, by leveraging the dual nature
of the two tasks, we propose an almost unsupervised learning method that only
leverages few hundreds of paired data and extra unpaired data for TTS and ASR.
Our method consists of the following components: (1) a denoising auto-encoder,
which reconstructs speech and text sequences respectively to develop the
capability of language modeling both in speech and text domain; (2) dual
transformation, where the TTS model transforms the text $y$ into speech
$\hat{x}$, and the ASR model leverages the transformed pair $(\hat{x},y)$ for
training, and vice versa, to boost the accuracy of the two tasks; (3)
bidirectional sequence modeling, which addresses error propagation especially
in the long speech and text sequence when training with few paired data; (4) a
unified model structure, which combines all the above components for TTS and
ASR based on Transformer model. Our method achieves 99.84% in terms of word
level intelligible rate and 2.68 MOS for TTS, and 11.7% PER for ASR on LJSpeech
dataset, by leveraging only 200 paired speech and text data (about 20 minutes
audio), together with extra unpaired speech and text data.

dynamics of non-rigid asteroid rotation, considering the final spin state of
rotation for a small celestial body (asteroid). The last condition means the
ultimate absence of the applied external torques (including short-term effect
from torques during collisions, long-term YORP effect, etc.). Fundamental law
of angular momentum conservation has been used for the aforementioned solving
procedure. The system of Euler equations for dynamics of non-rigid asteroid
rotation has been explored with regard to the existence of an analytic way of
presentation of the approximated solution. Despite of various perturbations
(such as collisions, YORP effect) which destabilize the rotation of asteroid
via deviating from the current spin state, the inelastic (mainly, tidal)
dissipation reduces kinetic energy of asteroid. So, evolution of the spinning
asteroid should be resulting by the rotation about maximal-inertia axis with
the proper spin state corresponding to minimal energy with a fixed angular
momentum. Basing on the aforesaid assumption (component K_1 is supposed to be
fluctuating near the given appropriate constant of the fixed angular momentum),
we have obtained that 2-nd component K_2 is the solution of appropriate Riccati
ordinary differential equation of 1-st order, whereas component K_3 should be
determined via expression for K_2.

various networks, but most of the existing embedding methods omit the network
dynamics and the multiplicity of edges, so it is difficult to accurately
describe the detailed characteristics of the transaction networks. Ethereum is
a blockchain-based platform supporting smart contracts. The open nature of
blockchain makes the transaction data on Ethereum completely public, and also
brings unprecedented opportunities for the transaction network analysis. By
taking the realistic rules and features of transaction networks into
consideration, we first model the Ethereum transaction network as a Temporal
Weighted Multidigraph (TWMDG), where each node is a unique Ethereum account and
each edge represents a transaction weighted by amount and assigned with
timestamp. Then we define the problem of Temporal Weighted Multidigraph
Embedding (T-EDGE) by incorporating both temporal and weighted information of
the edges, the purpose being to capture more comprehensive properties of
dynamic transaction networks. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
embedding method, we conduct experiments of node classification on real-world
transaction data collected from Ethereum. Experimental results demonstrate that
T-EDGE outperforms baseline embedding methods, indicating that time-dependent
walks and multiplicity characteristic of edges are informative and essential
for time-sensitive transaction networks.

applications. States and objects are intertwined together, meaning that object

addresses the state identification problem in cooking related images and uses
state and object predictions together to improve the classification accuracy of
objects and their states from a single image. The pipeline presented in this
paper includes a CNN with a double classification layer and the Concept-Net
language knowledge graph on top. The language knowledge creates a semantic
likelihood between objects and states. The resulting object and state
confidences from the deep architecture are used together with object and state
relatedness estimates from a language knowledge graph to produce marginal
probabilities for objects and states. The marginal probabilities and
confidences of objects (or states) are fused together to improve the final
object (or state) classification results. Experiments on a dataset of cooking
objects show that using a language knowledge graph on top of a deep neural
network effectively enhances object and state classification.

production lines represent new challenges. To address these demands, future
plants must be highly flexible and dynamically reconfigurable. Current systems
are usually based on wired technologies for the connection of sensors,
actuators, and controlling or monitoring devices that allow only very limited
dynamics. New applications, such as the use of robots, drones, or
reconfigurable production lines, require the exploitation of wireless
communication technologies. However, current technologies are not able to meet
the high requirements in terms of latency, robustness, resilience and data
rate. The introduction of the 5th generation (5G) cellular communication system
will meet these requirements for the first time. Besides the use of radio-based
solutions in new plants - so-called greenfield scenarios - deploying 5G also
represents an efficient migration of existing plants - so-called brownfield
scenarios - to Industry 4.0. In order to ensure that the challenging
requirements are indeed meet in practical deployments of the new 5G technology,
a tailor-made architecture is being developed within the Tactile Internet 4.0
(TACNET 4.0) project. As a basis for the design of the architecture,
representative Industry 4.0 application scenarios, which are also be considered
by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), were analyzed and compliance
with the latest developments in the relevant standardization is also our
target. The paper gives an overview of the considered use cases as well as the
relevant reference architectures and the design process of the TACNET 4.0
