based on learning data representations. These models are inspired by human
biological nervous systems, even if there are various differences pertaining to
the structural and functional properties of biological brains. The elementary
constituents of deep learning models are neurons, which can be considered as
functions that receive inputs and produce an output that is a weighted sum of
the inputs fed through an activation function. Several models of neurons were
proposed in the course of the years that are all based on learnable parameters
called weights. In this paper we present a new type of artificial neuron, the
double-weight neuron,characterized by additional learnable weights that lead to
a more complex and accurate system. We tested a feed-forward and convolutional
neural network consisting of double-weight neurons on the MNIST dataset, and we
tested a convolution network on the CIFAR-10 dataset. For MNIST we find a
$\approx 4\%$ and $\approx 1\%$ improved classification accuracy, respectively,
when compared to a standard feed-forward and convolutional neural network built
with the same sets of hyperparameters. For CIFAR-10 we find a $\approx 12\%$
improved classification accuracy. We thus conclude that this novel artificial
neuron can be considered as a valuable alternative to common ones.

efficient RF sources controllable in phase and power. It is desirable to have

millisecond range is required. The efficiency of the traditional RF sources
(klystrons, IOTs, solid-state amplifiers) in comparison to magnetrons is lower
and the cost of unit of RF power is significantly higher. Typically, the cost
of RF sources and their operation is a significant part of the total project
cost and operation. The magnetron-based RF sources with a cost of power unit of
1-3 dollars per Watt would significantly reduce the capital and operation costs
in comparison with the traditional RF sources. This arouses interest in
magnetron RF sources for use in modern accelerators. A recently developed
kinetic model describing the principle of magnetron operation and subsequent
experiments resulted in an innovative technique producing the ""stimulated""
generation of magnetrons powered below the self-excitation threshold voltage.
The magnetron operation in this regime is stable, low noise, controllable in
phase and power, and provides higher efficiency than other types of RF power
sources. It allows operation in CW and pulse modes (at large duty factor). For
pulsed operation this technique does not require pulse modulators to form RF
pulses. It also looks as a promising opportunity to extend magnetron life time.
The developed technique, its experimental verification and a brief explanation

~80-90 days after peak-I to produce peak-II. This unifies all four outbursts

two-component accretion disc model where a Keplerian accretion disc produces
the soft photons and the hard part of the spectrum originates from a hot

labels are shared across utterances. DNNs are then trained to discriminate all

addition, we propose a segment-based unsupervised clustering algorithm to
re-assign class labels to the segments. TD-SV experiments were conducted on the
RedDots challenge database. The TCL-DNNs were trained using speech data of
fixed pass-phrases that were excluded from the TD-SV evaluation set, so the
learned features can be considered phrase-independent. We compare the

Experiments and first principles calculations consistently show that the

enhanced spin mixing conductance across YIG/C60/Pt interfaces. As a result, a
600% increase in the SSE voltage (VLSSE) has been realized in YIG/C60/Pt

for the emergence and evolution of named color categories across languages,

not yet clear to what extent this account generalizes to semantic domains other
than color. Here we show that it generalizes to two qualitatively different
semantic domains: names for containers, and for animals. First, we show that
container naming in Dutch and French is near-optimal in the IB sense, and that
IB broadly accounts for soft categories and inconsistent naming patterns in
both languages. Second, we show that a hierarchy of animal categories derived
from IB captures cross-linguistic tendencies in the growth of animal
taxonomies. Taken together, these findings suggest that fundamental
information-theoretic principles of efficient coding may shape semantic
categories across languages and across domains.

  System for Stable Employment","45 pages, 28 figures, RecSys 2019",,,,"cs.DS cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coordination failure reduces match quality among employers and candidates in
the job market, resulting in a large number of unfilled positions and/or
unstable, short-term employment. Centralized job search engines provide a
platform that connects directly employers with job-seekers. However, they
require users to disclose a significant amount of personal data, i.e., build a
user profile, in order to provide meaningful recommendations. In this paper, we
present PrivateJobMatch -- a privacy-oriented deferred multi-match recommender
system -- which generates stable pairings while requiring users to provide only
a partial ranking of their preferences. PrivateJobMatch explores a series of
adaptations of the game-theoretic Gale-Shapley deferred-acceptance algorithm
which combine the flexibility of decentralized markets with the intelligence of
centralized matching. We identify the shortcomings of the original algorithm
when applied to a job market and propose novel solutions that rely on machine
learning techniques. Experimental results on real and synthetic data confirm
the benefits of the proposed algorithms across several quality measures. Over
the past year, we have implemented a PrivateJobMatch prototype and deployed it
in an active job market economy. Using the gathered real-user preference data,
we find that the match-recommendations are superior to a typical decentralized
job market---while requiring only a partial ranking of the user preferences.

achieve compact representations of unorganized 3D point clouds in an
unsupervised manner. Many previous works discretize 3D points to voxels and
then use lattice-based methods to process and learn 3D spatial information;
however, this leads to inevitable discretization errors. In this work, we
handle raw 3D points without such compromise. The proposed networks follow the
autoencoder framework with a focus on designing the decoder. The encoder adopts
similar architectures as in PointNet. The decoder involves three novel modules.
The folding module folds a canonical 2D lattice to the underlying surface of a
3D point cloud, achieving coarse reconstruction; the graph-topology-inference
module learns a graph topology to represent pairwise relationships between 3D
points, pushing the latent code to preserve both coordinates and pairwise
relationships of points in 3D point clouds; and the graph-filtering module
couples the above two modules, refining the coarse reconstruction through a
learnt graph topology to obtain the final reconstruction. The proposed decoder
leverages a learnable graph topology to push the codeword to preserve
representative features and further improve the unsupervised-learning
performance. We further provide theoretical analyses of the proposed
architecture. In the experiments, we validate the proposed networks in three
tasks, including 3D point cloud reconstruction, visualization, and transfer
classification. The experimental results show that (1) the proposed networks
outperform the state-of-the-art methods in various tasks; (2) a graph topology
can be inferred as auxiliary information without specific supervision on graph
topology inference; and (3) graph filtering refines the reconstruction, leading
to better performances.

applications, it has become necessary to improve the spectral efficiency of
existing wireless networks. One way of improving spectral efficiency is to
share the spectrum amongst different coexisting networks and serve multiple
devices simultaneously. Spectrum sharing mechanisms for coexistence of a
licensed network, such as LTE, with an unlicensed network, such as Wi-Fi, are
being considered in the recent literature and standardizations. In order to
enable the coexistence between licensed and unlicensed users, it is necessary
to include interference mitigation techniques to protect the licensed primary
users (PUs) from harmful interference. Typical interference mitigation
mechanisms are based on spectrum sensing and cognitive radio (CR), wherein
unlicensed secondary users (SUs) observe the spectrum and utilize it when
licensed PUs are inactive. Thus, the SUs utilize empty time-slots in the shared
spectrum to avoid the interference. The spectral efficiency can be further
improved if the SUs are allowed to transmit concurrently with PUs by exploiting
the spatial dimension provided by multiple antenna techniques. The underlay CR
paradigm allows such coexistence where SUs transmit its signal in the same
time-slots as PUs by exploiting the spatial and frequency resources in the
network. In order to exploit the spatial dimension, SUs can utilize the
location coordinates of PUs to steer its signal away from PUs to mitigate the
interference. The SU transmitter can also employ multiple antenna techniques to
serve a large number of devices. Further, the SUs can utilize frequency bands
occupied by PUs by dynamically selecting the frequency band that provides the
highest rate. In this work, we develop techniques for PU location estimation,
spatial resource allocation and frequency band selection for SUs in underlay CR
networks.

advancing understanding of very strong spin-orbit effects in conducting systems

applications. Here, we report the experimental determination of the rapid
variation of the intrinsic SHC of Pt with the carrier lifetime ({\tau}) in the
dirty-metal regime by incorporating finely dispersed MgO inter-site impurities
into the Pt while maintaining the essential elements of its band structure
(face-centered-cubic order). This findings conclusively validate the
theoretical prediction that the SHC in Pt in the dirty-metal regime should be
dominated by the intrinsic Berry curvature contribution and should decrease
rapidly with shortening {\tau}. This also establishes the limit to which the
spin Hall ratio {\theta}SH of pure Pt can be increased by shortening {\tau}.
When the spin backflow at the Pt/ferromagnet interface due to the finite
interfacial spin-mixing conductance is taken into account, the amplitude of the
intrinsic SHC of Pt in the clean limit is found to be at least 1.6x10^6

restriction on every affine line is continuous. For functions defined on

more exclusive 'packs'. These images are then sold to unwitting customers who

only needed to provide explicit closed form expressions for biases and
variances of our estimators. Moreover, we observe that the mean squared error
of the proposed variance estimator does not depend on either the unknown smooth
function that is a part of the mean signal nor on the values of difference
sequence coefficients. Our approach also suggests sufficient conditions for
$\sqrt{n}-$ consistency of the proposed estimators.

However, there is a lack of understanding on what they are learning and how
sophisticated the learned graph functions are. In this work, we propose a
dissection of GNNs on graph classification into two parts: 1) the graph
filtering, where graph-based neighbor aggregations are performed, and 2) the
set function, where a set of hidden node features are composed for prediction.
To study the importance of both parts, we propose to linearize them separately.
We first linearize the graph filtering function, resulting Graph Feature
Network (GFN), which is a simple lightweight neural net defined on a
\textit{set} of graph augmented features. Further linearization of GFN's set
function results in Graph Linear Network (GLN), which is a linear function.
Empirically we perform evaluations on common graph classification benchmarks.
To our surprise, we find that, despite the simplification, GFN could match or
exceed the best accuracies produced by recently proposed GNNs (with a fraction
of computation cost), while GLN underperforms significantly. Our results
demonstrate the importance of non-linear set function, and suggest that linear
graph filtering with non-linear set function is an efficient and powerful
scheme for modeling existing graph classification benchmarks.

rates in a flow cell. We achieved this result in a flow cell containing a
bipolar membrane (BPM) and a silver nanoparticle catalyst on a porous carbon
support. Electrolysis upon a N2-saturated 3.0-M potassium bicarbonate
electrolyte solution yields CO with a faradaic efficiency (F.E.CO) of 81% at 25

experiment where the electrolyte is saturated with gaseous CO2 (faradaic
efficiency for CO is 78% at 25 mA cm-2 and 35% at 100 mA cm-2). The H+ flux
from the BPM is critical to this chemistry in that it reacts with the
bicarbonate feed to generate CO2, which is then reduced to CO at the gas
diffusion electrode. These results are important in that they show that the
addition of gaseous CO2 to bicarbonate electrolytes is not necessary in order
to obtain reduced carbon products with a flow cell architecture. This process
offers a means of using electrolysis to bypass the thermally-intensive step of
extracting CO2 from bicarbonate solutions generated in carbon capture schemes.

vectorization and graphics processing units (GPUs). Fitting the MDS model using
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, GPUs can deliver more than 100-fold speedups over
serial calculations and thus extend Bayesian MDS to a big data setting. To
illustrate, we employ Bayesian MDS to infer the rate at which different
seasonal influenza virus subtypes use worldwide air traffic to spread around
the globe. We examine 5392 viral sequences and their associated 14 million
pairwise distances arising from the number of commercial airline seats per year
between viral sampling locations. To adjust for shared evolutionary history of
the viruses, we implement a phylogenetic extension to the MDS model and learn
that subtype H3N2 spreads most effectively, consistent with its epidemic
success relative to other seasonal influenza subtypes. Finally, we provide
MassiveMDS, an open-source, stand-alone C++ library and rudimentary R package,
and discuss program design and high-level implementation with an emphasis on
important aspects of computing architecture that become relevant at scale.

that the temporal patterns of hashtags can be categorized into four different

hashtags at others. Second, we observe that a non-negligible proportion of
hashtags exhibit large semantic displacement. We demonstrate hashtags that are
more uniformly shared among users, as quantified by the proposed hashtag
entropy, are less prone to semantic displacement. In the end, we propose a
bipartite graph embedding model to summarize users' hashtag profiles, and rely
on these profiles to perform friendship prediction. Evaluation results show
that our approach achieves an effective prediction with AUC (area under the ROC

fluid is moving in flexible tubes with elastic walls. In the real-life
applications like blood flow, there is often an additional complexity of
vorticity being present in the fluid. We present a theory for the dynamics of
interaction of fluids and structures. The equations are derived using the
variational principle, with the incompressibility constraint of the fluid
giving rise to a pressure-like term. In order to connect this work with the
previous literature, we consider the case of inextensible and unshearable tube
with a straight centerline. In the absence of vorticity, our model reduces to
previous models considered in the literature, yielding the equations of
conservation of fluid momentum, wall momentum and the fluid volume. We show
that even when the vorticity is present, but is kept at a constant value, the
case of an inextensible, unshearable and straight tube with elastics walls
carrying a fluid allows an alternative formulation, reducing to a single
compact equation for the back-to-labels map instead of three conservation
equations. That single equation shows interesting instability in solutions when
the vorticity exceeds a certain threshold. Furthermore, the equation in stable
regime can be reduced to Boussinesq-type, KdV and Monge-Amp\`ere equations
equations in several appropriate limits, namely, the first two in the limit of
long time and length scales and the third one in the additional limit of the
small cross-sectional area. For the unstable regime, we numerical solutions

is composed of more than one stable component. In this work we investigate a
two-component dark matter with one component from the visible sector and the
other from the hidden sector. Specifically we consider a $U(1)_X$ hidden sector
extension of MSSM/SUGRA where we allow for kinetic and Stueckelberg mass mixing
between the two abelian $U(1)'s$, i.e., $U(1)_X$ and $U(1)_Y$. We further
assume that the hidden sector has chiral matter which leads to a Dirac fermion
as a candidate for dark matter. The lightest neutralino in the visible sector
and the Dirac fermion in the hidden sector then constitute the two components
of dark matter. We investigate in particular MSSM/SUGRA models with radiative
breaking occurring on the hyperbolic branch where the Higgs mixing parameter
$\mu$ is small (order the electroweak scale) which leads to a lightest
neutralino being dominantly a higgsino. While dark matter constituted only of
higgsinos is significantly constrained by data on dark matter relic density and
by limits on spin independent proton-DM scattering cross section, consistency
with data can be achieved if only a fraction of the dark matter relic density
is constituted of higgsinos with the rest coming from the hidden sector. An
aspect of the proposed model is the prediction of a relatively light CP odd
Higgs $A$ (as well as a CP even $H$ and a charged Higgs $H^{\pm}$) which is
observable at HL-LHC and HE-LHC. We perform a detailed collider analysis search
for the CP odd Higgs using boosted decision trees in $\tau_h\tau_h$ final
states and compare the discovery potential at HL-LHC and HE-LHC. We show that
while several of the points among our benchmarks may be observable at HL-LHC,
all of them are visible at HE-LHC with much lower integrated luminosities thus
reducing significantly the run time for discovery.

effortlessly setting up general and even complex multi--state models, where
moments of all orders are then expressed explicitly in terms of so--called

combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global

monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which

performance is better than randomization for escaping traps. Second, we present
the time-to-solution distribution of the impulse algorithm and compare it with

attention. Particularly, analysis of metabolites demands more preparation since
those small compounds have recently been measurable in large scales with mass
spectrometry techniques. We introduce novel statistical techniques for
metabolite missing values imputation by utilizing replication samples. Results:
To understand the nature of the missing values using replication samples, we
obtained the empirical distribution of missing values and observed that the
rate of missing values is approximately distributed as uniform across the
metabolite range. Therefore, the missing values cannot be imputed with the
lowest values. Using the identified distribution, we illustrated a simulation
study to find an optimal imputation approach for metabolites. Conclusions: We
demonstrated that the missing values in metabolomic data sets might not be
necessarily low value. After identification of the nature of missing values, we
validated K nearest neighborhood as an optimal approach for imputation.

with a generative adversarial network and conditional random field (GAN-CRF)
-based framework, which integrates a semi-supervised deep learning and a
probabilistic graphical model, and make three contributions. First, we design
four types of convolutional and transposed convolutional layers that consider
the characteristics of HSIs to help with extracting discriminative features
from limited numbers of labeled HSI samples. Second, we construct
semi-supervised GANs to alleviate the shortage of training samples by adding
labels to them and implicitly reconstructing real HSI data distribution through
adversarial training. Third, we build dense conditional random fields (CRFs) on
top of the random variables that are initialized to the softmax predictions of
the trained GANs and are conditioned on HSIs to refine classification maps.
This semi-supervised framework leverages the merits of discriminative and
generative models through a game-theoretical approach. Moreover, even though we
used very small numbers of labeled training HSI samples from the two most
challenging and extensively studied datasets, the experimental results
demonstrated that spectral-spatial GAN-CRF (SS-GAN-CRF) models achieved
top-ranking accuracy for semi-supervised HSI classification.

restricted-isometry property. Our main contribution is a theory for sparse
recovery adapted to deterministic settings. We show that convex programming
succeeds in recovering the parameters of interest, as long as their values are
sufficiently distinct with respect to the correlation structure of the

rates ranging from 6 kb/s to 40 kb/s. However, Opus is at its core a waveform

As the rate reduces even further, parametric coders tend to perform better than
waveform coders. In this paper we propose a backward-compatible way of
improving low bit rate Opus quality by re-synthesizing speech from the decoded

that is not feasible for a practical system, yet provides a best known
achievable quality with generative models. LPCNet is a low-complexity,
low-latency RNN-based generative model, and practically implementable on mobile
phones. We apply these systems with parameters from Opus coded at 6 kb/s as
conditioning features for the generative models. A listening test shows that
for the same 6 kb/s Opus bit stream, synthesized speech using LPCNet clearly
outperforms the output of the standard Opus decoder. This opens up ways to
improve the decoding quality of existing speech and audio waveform coders

surrogate, and we show that this surrogate can be efficiently obtained by the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). By properly monitoring
ADMM's convergence, the proposed algorithm is empirically efficient and also
theoretically guaranteed to converge to a critical point. Extensive experiments
are performed on four machine learning applications using both synthetic and

power conserving strategy for small rotorcraft to perch on an overhang. In the
vicinity of a ceiling, spinning propellers generate markedly higher thrust. To
understand the observed aerodynamic phenomena}, momentum theory and blade
element method are employed to describe the thrust, power, and rotational rate

which take into account the influence of neighboring propellers as present in
multirotor vehicles, are verified using two propeller types 23-mm and 50-mm
radii in various configurations on a benchtop setup. The results are consistent
with the proposed models. In proximity to the ceiling, power consumption of
propellers with 23-mm radius arranged in a quadrotor configuration was found to
reduce by a factor of three. To this end, we present a conceptual prototype
that demonstrates the use of ceiling effects for perching maneuvers. Overall,
the promising outcomes highlight possible uses of ceiling effects for efficient

Multi-Resolution Estimator (MRE), whose expected error (when $B\ge\log mn$)
meets the aforementioned lower bound up to poly-logarithmic factors, and is

the effect of the TDS accretion on the spin evolution of these relatively small
MBHs, by also considering the accretion of gas-clouds with (many) chaotic
episodes. We find that the accretion of TDSs can play an important role or even
a dominant role in shaping the spin distribution of $\sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$ MBHs,
depending on the contribution fraction ($f_{\rm TDE}$) of the TDS accretion to
the MBH growth. If $f_{\rm TDE}$ is as large as $\gtrsim 0.9$, most $\sim
10^6M_{\odot}$ MBHs have low spins ($|a| \lesssim 0.3$); if $f_{\rm TDE}$ is as
small as $\lesssim 0.1$, most $\sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$ MBHs have high spins ($|a|
\gtrsim 0.7$). We also find that (1) the fraction of highly spinning $\sim 10^6
M_{\odot}$ MBHs in the TDS accretion states is smaller than that in the
gas-cloud (AGN) accretion states, which is a consequence of more rapid spin
decrease during the period of consecutive TDS accretion than the spin increase
during the AGN periods when the spin is large; (2) the fraction of retrograde
spin accretion in the TDS accretion states is almost the same as that of
prograde spin accretion, while it is negligible in the gas-cloud (AGN)
accretion states. Current scarce sample of AGNs ($\sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$) with
spin measurements hints an insignificant contribution from TDS accretion to MBH
growth. Future measurements on spins of $\sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$ MBHs may provide
stronger constraints on the importance of both AGN and TDS accretion states in
their growth history.

they are usually evaluated by intrinsically-motivated play, i.e., playing games
without extrinsic rewards but evaluated with extrinsic rewards. However, none
of the existing intrinsic reward approaches can achieve human-level performance
under this very challenging setting of intrinsically-motivated play. In this
work, we propose a novel megalomania-driven intrinsic reward (called
mega-reward), which, to our knowledge, is the first approach that achieves
human-level performance in intrinsically-motivated play. Intuitively,
mega-reward comes from the observation that infants' intelligence develops when
they try to gain more control on entities in an environment; therefore,
mega-reward aims to maximize the control capabilities of agents on given
entities in a given environment. To formalize mega-reward, a relational
transition model is proposed to bridge the gaps between direct and latent
control. Experimental studies show that mega-reward (i) can greatly outperform
all state-of-the-art intrinsic reward approaches, (ii) generally achieves the
same level of performance as Ex-PPO and professional human-level scores, and
(iii) has also a superior performance when it is incorporated with extrinsic
rewards.

different tasks like classification, detection, segmentation, and so on.
Ensemble learning is widely known to further improve performance by combining
multiple complementary models. It is easy to apply ensemble learning for
classification tasks, for example, based on averaging, voting, or other
methods. However, for other tasks (like object detection) where the outputs are
varying in quantity and unable to be simply compared, the ensemble of multiple
models become difficult. In this paper, we propose a new method called
Predictive Ensemble Learning (PEL), based on powerful predictive ability of
deep neural networks, to directly predict the best performing model among a
pool of base models for each test example, thus transforming ensemble learning
to a traditional classification task. Taking scene text detection as the
application, where no suitable ensemble learning strategy exists, PEL can
significantly improve the performance, compared to either individual
state-of-the-art models, or the fusion of multiple models by non-maximum
suppression. Experimental results show the possibility and potential of PEL in
predicting different models' performance based only on a query example, which
can be extended for ensemble learning in many other complex tasks.

privacy preserving data analysis methods have become of great importance.
Researchers have proposed different methods for this purpose. Secure
multi-party computation is one of such techniques that allows a group of
parties to evaluate a function on their data without revealing the data. This
is done by secret sharing approach, in which parties share a piece of their
data using polynomials and after doing function evaluation on shares of data
finally they do a Lagrange interpolation to get the result. Two approaches have
been proposed in secure multi-party computation for evaluating a function,
arithmetic gates and logical gates. In both of them and since communication is
an important step in multi-party computation, errors may happen. So, being able
to detect and correct errors is important. Moreover, as adversaries may
interrupt communication or manipulate the data, either in communication or
during computation, this error detection and correction provide participating
parties with a technique to detect such errors. Hence, in this paper we present
a secure multi-party computation error correcting technique that has the
ability to detect and correct errors on players shares. This technique is based
on Berlekamp-Welch error correcting codes and we assume that players shares are
generated using Reed-Solomon codes.

physical models. The spectral modelling using nthComp gives a photon index in
the range between 2.18-2.37 and electron temperature ranging from 21 to 63 keV.
The seed photon temperature is within 0.19 to 0.29 keV. The high flux in 0.3 -
80 keV band corresponds to a luminosity varying from 0.7 to 1.07 L_Edd assuming
the source to be at a distance of 8 kpc and hosting a black hole with a mass of
6 M$_{\odot}$. The physical model based on the two-component accretion flow
gives disc accretion rates as high as ~ 1 $\dot{m}_{Edd}$ and halo rate ~ 0.2

main reason for the unprecedented high flux observed from this source. The

$1-\beta$-fraction) of the input data consists of outliers and the goal of an
algorithm is to output a small list $\mathcal{L}$ of hypotheses such that one
of them agrees with inliers. We develop a framework for list-decodable learning
via the Sum-of-Squares SDP hierarchy and demonstrate it on two basic
statistical estimation problems
  {\it Linear regression:} Suppose we are given labelled examples
$\{(X_i,y_i)\}_{i \in [N]}$ containing a subset $S$ of $\beta N$ {\it inliers}
$\{X_i \}_{i \in S}$ that are drawn i.i.d. from standard Gaussian distribution
$N(0,I)$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where the corresponding labels $y_i$ are
well-approximated by a linear function $\ell$. We devise an algorithm that
outputs a list $\mathcal{L}$ of linear functions such that there exists some
$\hat{\ell} \in \mathcal{L}$ that is close to $\ell$.
  This yields the first algorithm for linear regression in a list-decodable
setting. Our results hold for any distribution of examples whose concentration
and anticoncentration can be certified by Sum-of-Squares proofs.
  {\it Mean Estimation:}
  Given data points $\{X_i\}_{i \in [N]}$ containing a subset $S$ of $\beta N$
{\it inliers} $\{X_i \}_{i \in S}$ that are drawn i.i.d. from a Gaussian
distribution $N(\mu,I)$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we devise an algorithm that
generates a list $\mathcal{L}$ of means such that there exists $\hat{\mu} \in
\mathcal{L}$ close to $\mu$.
  The recovery guarantees of the algorithm are analogous to the existing
algorithms for the problem by Diakonikolas \etal and Kothari \etal.
  In an independent and concurrent work, Karmalkar \etal \cite{KlivansKS19}
also obtain an algorithm for list-decodable linear regression using the
Sum-of-Squares SDP hierarchy.

described as a bath of oscillators with Ohmic density of states. In turn, the
precise characterization of these classes of environments is a crucial tool to
engineer decoherence or to tailor quantum information protocols. Recently, the
use of quantum probes in characterizing Ohmic environments at zero-temperature
has been discussed, showing that a single qubit provides precise estimation of
the cutoff frequency. On the other hand, thermal noise often spoil quantum
probing schemes, and for this reason we here extend the analysis to complex
system at thermal equilibrium. In particular, we discuss the interplay between
thermal fluctuations and time evolution in determining the precision
{attainable by} quantum probes. Our results show that the presence of thermal
fluctuations degrades the precision for low values of the cutoff frequency,
i.e. values of the order $\omega_c \lesssim T$ (in natural units). For larger
values of $\omega_c$ decoherence is mostly due to the structure of environment,
rather than thermal fluctuations, such that quantum probing by a single qubit
is still an effective estimation procedure.

attractive features of the modern smart grids such as effective demand response
and reduced electric bills. However, uncoordinated charging of ESUs stresses
the power system. In this paper, we propose privacy-preserving and
collusion-resistant charging coordination centralized and decentralized schemes
for the smart grid. The centralized scheme is used in case of robust
communication infrastructure that connects the ESUs to the utility, while the
decentralized scheme is useful in case of infrastructure not available or
costly. In the centralized scheme, each energy storage unit should acquire
anonymous tokens from a charging controller (CC) to send multiple charging
requests to the CC via the aggregator. CC can use the charging requests to
enough data to run the charging coordination scheme, but it cannot link the
data to particular ESUs or reveal any private information. Our centralized
scheme uses a modified knapsack problem formulation technique to maximize the
amount of power delivered to the ESUs before the charging requests expire
without exceeding the available maximum charging capacity. In the decentralized
scheme, several ESUs run the scheme in a distributed way with no need to
aggregator or CC. One ESU is selected as a head node that should decrypt the
ciphertext of the aggregated messages of the ESUs' messages and broadcast it to
the community while not revealing the ESUs' individual charging demands. Then,
ESUs can coordinate charging requests based on the aggregated charging demand
while not exceeding the maximum charging capacity. Extensive experiments and
simulations are conducted to demonstrate that our schemes are efficient and
secure against various attacks, and can preserve ESU owner's privacy.

considerations in the LSST instrument barrel make it difficult to accommodate
infrared sensors that require very low operating temperatures, and the current
generation of buttable IR sensors that would extend sensitivity to 2 $\mu$m

there would be a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) embedded inside the dynamic ejecta.
The PWN emission may be absorbed by the ejecta or leak out of the system. We
study the effect of the PWN emission on the observed light curves and radiation
spectra. Different from previous works, the absorption and leakage of the PWN
emission are all involved in our model, where the absorption of the PWN
emission heats up the ejecta and alters its radiation. It is found that the
characteristic emission of the embedded PWN quickly evolves. For the multiband
and long-term observations of AT 2017gfo, we find that the dynamic ejecta with
a PWN emission can fit the observational data very well, especially for the
light curves at $t\sim 5$ days and those in the late phase. In addition, our

approaches to analyze the normal-phase electronic and structural properties of

study can be employed to set fundamental connections among WP and the CrAs and
MnP superconductors belonging to the same space group. One of the key features
of the resulting electronic structure is represented by the occurrence of
multiple band crossings along specific high symmetry lines of the Brilloiun
zone. In particular, we demonstrate that the eight-fold band degeneracy
obtained along the SR path at (kx,ky)=(Pi,Pi) is due to inversion-time reversal
invariance and a pair of nonsymmorphic symmetries. The presence of multiple
degenerate Fermi points along the SR direction constraints the topology of the
Fermi surface, which manifests distinctive marks when considering its evolution
upon band filling variation. If the Fermi level crosses the bands along the SR
line as it happens at the nominal filling of the MnP, these Fermi surfaces are
open or closed Fermi pockets. Moving the relative position of the Fermi level
away from the eight-fold degenerate bands as for the WP and CrAs compounds, the
electronic changeover exhibits a simultaneous modification of the Fermi surface
dimensionality and topology. Four two-dimensional (2D) Fermi surface sheets are
centered around the SR line with a corrugated profile along the kz direction.
Moreover, we show that the spin-orbit interaction determines a selective
removal of the band degeneracy and, consequently, a splitting of the quasi 2D
Fermi sheets, as it happens in WP. Finally, we comment on the connections

surface smoothing. Through analyzing the differential property of surfaces, we
show that the conventional discrete Laplacian operator with uniform weights is
not applicable to feature points at which the surface is non-differentiable and
the second order derivatives do not exist. To overcome this difficulty, we
propose a Half-kernel Laplacian Operator (HLO) as an alternative to the
conventional Laplacian. Given a vertex v, HLO first finds all pairs of its
neighboring vertices and divides each pair into two subsets (called half
windows); then computes the uniform Laplacians of all such subsets and
subsequently projects the computed Laplacians to the full-window uniform
Laplacian to alleviate flipping and degeneration. The half window with least
regularization energy is then chosen for v. We develop an iterative approach to
apply HLO for surface denoising. Our method is conceptually simple and easy to
use because it has a single parameter, i.e., the number of iterations for
updating vertices. We show that our method can preserve features better than
the popular uniform Laplacian-based denoising and it significantly alleviates
the shrinkage artifact. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HLO is
better than or comparable to state-of-the-art techniques both qualitatively and

infinitely rich world of possibilities. If so, why is that cryptographers have

Invariant attacks can be constructed explicitly through the study of roots of

two unique effects: a distinct phase shift in the gravitational wave strain
during the inspiral and an enhancement of the radio emission due to the
resonant axion-photon conversion occurring in the neutron star magnetosphere
throughout the inspiral and merger. Remarkably, the observation of the
gravitational wave signal can be used to infer the Dark Matter density and,
consequently, to predict the radio emission. We study the projected reach of
the LISA interferometer and next-generation radio telescopes such as the Square

nodes in a social network of voters to be the starters of a political campaign
aiming at supporting a given target candidate. Voters reached by the campaign
change their opinions on the candidates. The goal is to shape the diffusion of
the campaign in such a way that the chances of victory of the target candidate
are maximized. Previous work shows that the problem can be approximated within
a constant factor in several models of information diffusion and voting
systems, assuming that the controller, i.e., the external agent that starts the
campaign, has full knowledge of the preferences of voters. However this
information is not always available since some voters might not reveal it.
Herein we relax this assumption by considering that each voter is associated
with a probability distribution over the candidates. We propose two models in
which, when an electoral campaign reaches a voter, this latter modifies its
probability distribution according to the amount of influence it received from
its neighbors in the network. We then study the election control problem
through social influence on the new models: In the first model, under the
Gap-ETH, election control cannot be approximated within a factor better than
$1/n^{o(1)}$, where $n$ is the number of voters; in the second model, which is
a slight relaxation of the first one, the problem admits a constant factor
approximation algorithm.

produce a better performance than that could be obtained from any of SR methods
to be ensembled (or called component super-resolvers). Based on the assumption
that better component super-resolver should have larger ensemble weight when
performing SR reconstruction, we present a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)

we introduce a reference dataset, which is composed of High-Resolution (HR) and
Low-Resolution (LR) image pairs, to measure the super-resolution abilities

ensemble weights, we propose to incorporate the reconstruction constraint,
which states that the degenerated HR image should be equal to the LR
observation one, as well as the prior knowledge of ensemble weights into the
MAP estimation framework. Moreover, the proposed optimization problem can be
solved by an analytical solution. We study the performance of the proposed

  quadrics","We added a new section",,,,"math.RA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $E$ be a Koszul Frobenius algebra. A Clifford deformation of $E$ is a
finite dimensional $\mathbb Z_2$-graded algebra $E(\theta)$, which corresponds
to a noncommutative quadric hypersurface $E^!/(z)$, for some central regular
element $z\in E^!_2$. It turns out that the bounded derived category
$D^b(\text{gr}_{\mathbb Z_2}E(\theta))$ is equivalent to the stable category of
the maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over $E^!/(z)$ provided that $E^!$ is
noetherian. As a consequence, $E^!/(z)$ is a noncommutative isolated
singularity if and only if the corresponding Clifford deformation $E(\theta)$
is a semisimple $\mathbb Z_2$-graded algebra. The preceding equivalence of
triangulated categories also indicates that Clifford deformations of trivial
extensions of a Koszul Frobenius algebra are related to the Kn\""{o}rrer
Periodicity Theorem for quadric hypersurfaces. As an application, we recover
Kn\""{o}rrer Periodicity Theorem without using of matrix factorizations.

able to provide strong sensitivity with respect to variations in the refractive

of functionalized MOWs whose capillaries are coated by a layer-by-layer (LBL)
approach, enabling the alternate deposition of silica particles (SiO2) at
different diameters - 300 nm, 420 nm, and 900 nm - and layers of
poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA). We demonstrate up to three
covering bilayers consisting of 300-nm silica particles. Modifications in the
MOW transmission spectrum induced by coating are measured and analyzed. The
proposed technique of MOW functionalization allows one to reach novel sensing
capabilities, including an increase in the effective sensing area and the
provision of a convenient scaffold for the attachment of long molecules such as

provided via the lens of universal learning. In applying universal learning to
linear regression the hypotheses class represents the label $y\in {\cal R}$ as
a linear combination of the feature vector $x^T\theta$ where $x\in {\cal R}^M$,
within a Gaussian error. The Predictive Normalized Maximum Likelihood (pNML)
solution for universal learning of individual data can be expressed
analytically in this case, as well as its associated learnability measure.
Interestingly, the situation where the number of parameters $M$ may even be
larger than the number of training samples $N$ can be examined. As expected, in
this case learnability cannot be attained in every situation; nevertheless, if
the test vector resides mostly in a subspace spanned by the eigenvectors
associated with the large eigenvalues of the empirical correlation matrix of
the training data, linear regression can generalize despite the fact that it
uses an ``over-parametrized'' model. We demonstrate the results with a
simulation of fitting a polynomial to data with a possibly large polynomial
degree.

then efficiently quantized by an analysis-by-synthesis vector quantization (AbS

substantial improvements in terms of frequency-weighted segmental SNR, STOI and

transverse dynamical structure factor (DSF) do not reproduce experimental

of high-energy spin-0 and spin-1 excitations move down. One of spin-0
quasiparticles becomes long-lived and its spectrum merges with the magnon

predict that the Higgs excitation and another spin-0 quasiparticle become

the spatio-temporal patterns of crime incidents. Our proposed model
incorporates multi-head attentional networks to learn different representation

""community-attentive"" networks, allows the prediction of a given location to be
optimized by a mixture of groups (i.e., communities) of regions. In addition,
our proposed model allows for interpreting what features, from what
communities, have more contributions to predicting local incidents as well as
how these communities are captured through forecasting. Our results on two

reinforcement learning techniques, there is an emerging trend of employing
reinforcement learning (RL) for traffic signal control. A key question for
applying RL to traffic signal control is how to define the reward and state.
The ultimate objective in traffic signal control is to minimize the travel
time, which is difficult to reach directly. Hence, existing studies often
define reward as an ad-hoc weighted linear combination of several traffic
measures. However, there is no guarantee that the travel time will be optimized
with the reward. In addition, recent RL approaches use more complicated state
(e.g., image) in order to describe the full traffic situation. However, none of
the existing studies has discussed whether such a complex state representation
is necessary. This extra complexity may lead to significantly slower learning
process but may not necessarily bring significant performance gain.
  In this paper, we propose to re-examine the RL approaches through the lens of
classic transportation theory. We ask the following questions: (1) How should
we design the reward so that one can guarantee to minimize the travel time? (2)
How to design a state representation which is concise yet sufficient to obtain
the optimal solution? Our proposed method LIT is theoretically supported by the
classic traffic signal control methods in transportation field. LIT has a very
simple state and reward design, thus can serve as a building block for future
RL approaches to traffic signal control. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art traffic signal control methods.

empowered people to improve the efficiency of our city functions. Among them,
improving the urban transportation efficiency is one of the most prominent
topics. Recent studies have proposed to use reinforcement learning (RL) for
traffic signal control. Different from traditional transportation approaches
which rely heavily on prior knowledge, RL can learn directly from the feedback.
On the other side, without a careful model design, existing RL methods
typically take a long time to converge and the learned models may not be able
to adapt to new scenarios. For example, a model that is trained well for
morning traffic may not work for the afternoon traffic because the traffic flow
could be reversed, resulting in a very different state representation. In this
paper, we propose a novel design called FRAP, which is based on the intuitive
principle of phase competition in traffic signal control: when two traffic
signals conflict, priority should be given to one with larger traffic movement
(i.e., higher demand). Through the phase competition modeling, our model
achieves invariance to symmetrical cases such as flipping and rotation in
traffic flow. By conducting comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our
model finds better solutions than existing RL methods in the complicated
all-phase selection problem, converges much faster during training, and
achieves superior generalizability for different road structures and traffic

parameters are of no interest to be estimated. In classical statistics, these
irrelevant parameters are called nuisance parameters and this problem is of
great importance in many practical applications of statistics. However, little
is known regarding the effects of nuisance parameters in quantum-state
estimation problems. The main contribution of this paper is first to formulate
the nuisance parameter problem for the quantum-state estimation theory, then to
propose a method of how to eliminate the nuisance parameters to obtain an
estimation error bound for the parameters of interest. We also develop useful
methods of dealing with the nuisance parameter problem in the quantum case and
reveal the significant difference from the classical case. In particular, we
clarify an intrinsic tradeoff relation to estimate the nuisance parameters and
parameters of interest. The general qubit model is examined in detail to
emphasize that we cannot ignore the effects of the nuisance parameters in
general. Several examples in qubit systems are worked out to illustrate our
findings.

making across a wide range of application domains including mobile health, food
safety, security, and resource management. A decision support system formalizes
online decision making as a map from up-to-date information to a recommended
decision. Online estimation of an optimal decision strategy from streaming data
requires simultaneous estimation of components of the underlying system
dynamics as well as the optimal decision strategy given these dynamics; thus,
there is an inherent trade-off between choosing decisions that lead to improved
estimates and choosing decisions that appear to be optimal based on current
estimates. Thompson (1933) was among the first to formalize this trade-off in
the context of choosing between two treatments for a stream of patients; he
proposed a simple heuristic wherein a treatment is selected randomly at each
time point with selection probability proportional to the posterior probability
that it is optimal. We consider a variant of Thompson sampling that is simple
to implement and can be applied to large and complex decision problems. We show
that the proposed Thompson sampling estimator is consistent for the optimal
decision support system and provide rates of convergence and finite sample
error bounds. The proposed algorithm is illustrated using an agent-based model
of the spread of influenza on a network and management of mallard populations

in those parts of the network where high service availability is needed most,
e.g., in a business district. While the performance should expectedly increase,

the opportunity to maximize the utility of an overall computing system by
employing reinforcement learning to guide the configuration of the set of

system-wide optimization is a combinatorial problem. Local attempts to boost
the performance of a specific module by modifying its configuration often leads
to losses in overall utility of the system's performance as the distribution of

techniques which consider a rich representation of the input, monitor the state
of the entire pipeline, and adjust the configuration of modules on-the-fly so
as to maximize the utility of a system's operation. We show significant
improvement in both real-world and synthetic pipelines across a variety of

long-standing controversy. Recently, some researchers in the PDP side of the
debate have argued that (1) classic PDP models can handle relational structure
(Rogers & McClelland, 2008, 2014) and (2) the success of deep learning
approaches to text processing suggests that structured representations are
unnecessary to capture the gist of human language (Rabovsky et al., 2018). In
the present study we tested the Story Gestalt model (St. John, 1992), a classic
PDP model of text comprehension, and a Sequence-to-Sequence with Attention
model (Bahdanau et al., 2015), a contemporary deep learning architecture for
text processing. Both models were trained to answer questions about stories
based on the thematic roles that several concepts played on the stories. In
three critical test we varied the statistical structure of new stories while
keeping their relational structure constant with respect to the training data.
Each model was susceptible to each statistical structure manipulation to a
different degree, with their performance failing below chance at least under
one manipulation. We argue that the failures of both models are due to the fact
that they cannotperform dynamic binding of independent roles and fillers.
Ultimately, these results cast doubts onthe suitability of traditional neural
networks models for explaining phenomena based on relational reasoning,
including language processing.

Specifically, for a target intersection in a network, CoLight can not only
incorporate the temporal and spatial influences of neighboring intersections to
the target intersection, but also build up index-free modeling of neighboring
intersections. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use graph
attentional networks in the setting of reinforcement learning for traffic

hundreds of traffic signals. In experiments, we demonstrate that by learning
