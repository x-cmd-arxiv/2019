models. To encourage robustness, it iteratively computes adversarial examples
for the model, and then re-trains on these examples via some update rule. This
work analyzes the performance of adversarial training on linearly separable
data, and provides bounds on the number of iterations required for large
margin. We show that when the update rule is given by an arbitrary empirical
risk minimizer, adversarial training may require exponentially many iterations
to obtain large margin. However, if gradient or stochastic gradient update
rules are used, only polynomially many iterations are required to find a
large-margin separator. By contrast, without the use of adversarial examples,
gradient methods may require exponentially many iterations to achieve large
margin. Our results are derived by showing that adversarial training with
gradient updates minimizes a robust version of the empirical risk at a
$\mathcal{O}(\ln(t)^2/t)$ rate, despite non-smoothness. We corroborate our
theory empirically.

also enable the exact description of the very small kinetic energy of the

Lorentz covariance properties of the MP theory discussed in our recent work

distributed nodes (machines). Monitoring the conditions of these nodes is
important for system management purposes, which, however, can be extremely
resource demanding as this requires collecting local measurements of each
individual node and constantly sending those measurements to a central
controller. Meanwhile, it is often useful to forecast the future system
conditions for various purposes such as resource planning/allocation and
anomaly detection, but it is usually too resource-consuming to have one
forecasting model running for each node, which may also neglect correlations in
observed metrics across different nodes. In this paper, we propose a mechanism
for collecting and forecasting the resource utilization of machines in a
distributed computing system in a scalable manner. We present an algorithm that
allows each local node to decide when to transmit its most recent measurement
to the central node, so that the transmission frequency is kept below a given
constraint value. Based on the measurements received from local nodes, the
central node summarizes the received data into a small number of clusters.
Since the cluster partitioning can change over time, we also present a method
to capture the evolution of clusters and their centroids. As an effective way
to reduce the amount of computation, time-series forecasting models are trained
on the time-varying centroids of each cluster, to forecast the future resource
utilizations of a group of local nodes. The effectiveness of our proposed
approach is confirmed by extensive experiments using multiple real-world

on a real line. In contrast to previous work, we assume that the agents are
unable to fully specify where their preferred location lies, and instead only
provide coarse information---namely, that their preferred location lies in some
interval. Given such partial preference information, we explore the design of
robust deterministic mechanisms, where by robust mechanisms we mean ones that
perform well with respect to all the possible unknown true preferred locations
of the agents. Towards this end, we consider two well-studied objective
functions and look at implementing these under two natural solution concepts
for our setting i) very weak dominance and ii) minimax dominance. We show that
under the former solution concept, there are no mechanisms that do better than
a naive mechanism which always, irrespective of the information provided by the
agents, outputs the same location. However, when using the latter, weaker,
solution concept, we show that one can do significantly better, and we provide
upper and lower bounds on the performance of mechanisms for the objective
functions of interest. Furthermore, we note that our mechanisms can be viewed
as extensions to the classical optimal mechanisms in that they perform
optimally when agents precisely know and specify their preferred locations.

there is increasing pressure on decision makers to be transparent about their
decision policies. At the same time, individuals may use knowledge, gained by
transparency, to invest effort strategically in order to maximize their chances
of receiving a beneficial decision. Our goal is to find decision policies that
are optimal in terms of utility in such a strategic setting. To this end, we
first characterize how strategic investment of effort by individuals leads to a
change in the feature distribution. Using this characterization, we first show
that, in general, we cannot expect to find optimal decision policies in
polynomial time and there are cases in which deterministic policies are
suboptimal. Then, we demonstrate that, if the cost individuals pay to change
their features satisfies a natural monotonicity assumption, we can narrow down
the search for the optimal policy to a particular family of decision policies
with a set of desirable properties, which allow for a highly effective
polynomial time heuristic search algorithm using dynamic programming. Finally,
under no assumptions on the cost individuals pay to change their features, we
develop an iterative search algorithm that is guaranteed to find locally
optimal decision policies also in polynomial time. Experiments on synthetic and
real credit card data illustrate our theoretical findings and show that the
decision policies found by our algorithms achieve higher utility than those
that do not account for strategic behavior.

success in the field of computer vision, especially on challenging image
classification tasks by relying on a universal approach, i.e., training a deep
model on a massive dataset of supervised examples. While unlabeled data are
often an abundant resource, collecting a large set of labeled data, on the
other hand, are very expensive, which often require considerable human efforts.
One way to ease out this is to effectively select and label highly informative
instances from a pool of unlabeled data (i.e., active learning). This paper
proposed a new method of batch-mode active learning, Dual Active Sampling(DAS),
which is based on a simple assumption, if two deep neural networks (DNNs) of
the same structure and trained on the same dataset give significantly different
output for a given sample, then that particular sample should be picked for
additional training. While other state of the art methods in this field usually
require intensive computational power or relying on a complicated structure,
DAS is simpler to implement and, managed to get improved results on Cifar-10
with preferable computational time compared to the core-set method.

such as recommender system and online advertising. Practically, it plays an
important role for CTR modeling in these applications by mining user interest
from rich historical behavior data. Driven by the development of deep learning,
deep CTR models with ingeniously designed architecture for user interest
modeling have been proposed, bringing remarkable improvement of model
performance over offline metric.However, great efforts are needed to deploy
these complex models to online serving system for realtime inference, facing
massive traffic request. Things turn to be more difficult when it comes to long
sequential user behavior data, as the system latency and storage cost increase
approximately linearly with the length of user behavior sequence. In this
paper, we face directly the challenge of long sequential user behavior modeling
and introduce our hands-on practice with the co-design of machine learning
algorithm and online serving system for CTR prediction task. Theoretically, the
co-design solution of UIC and MIMN enables us to handle the user interest
modeling with unlimited length of sequential behavior data. Comparison between
model performance and system efficiency proves the effectiveness of proposed
solution. To our knowledge, this is one of the first industrial solutions that
are capable of handling long sequential user behavior data with length scaling
up to thousands. It now has been deployed in the display advertising system in

rather than expand when heated - is both intriguing and useful, but remains
poorly understood. Current understanding hinges on the role of specific
vibrational modes, but in fact thermal expansion is a weighted sum of
contributions from every possible mode. Here we overcome this difficulty by
deriving a real-space model of atomic motion in the prototypical NTE material
scandium trifluoride, ScF3, from total neutron scattering data. We show that
NTE in this material depends not only on rigid unit modes - the vibrations in
which the scandium coordination octahedra remain undistorted - but also on
modes that distort these octahedra. Furthermore, in contrast with previous
predictions, we show that the quasiharmonic approximation coupled with
renormalisation through anharmonic interactions describes this behaviour well.
Our results point the way towards a new understanding of how NTE is manifested
in real materials.

Theorem to kick in, experimentation is challenging due to the wide confidence
interval of estimation. We demonstrate the pressure by running A/A simulations
with customer spending data from a large-scale Ecommerce site. Solutions are
then explored. On one front we address the heavy tail directly and highlight
the often ignored nuances of winsorization. In particular, the legitimacy of
false positive rate could be at risk. We are further inspired by the idea of
robust statistics and introduce Huber regression as a better way to measure
treatment effect. On another front covariates from pre-experiment period are
exploited. Although they are independent to assignment and potentially explain
the variation of response well, concerns are that models are learned against
prediction error rather than the bias of parameter. We find the framework of
orthogonal learning useful, matching not raw observations but residuals from
two predictions, one towards the response and the other towards the assignment.
Robust regression is readily integrated, together with cross-fitting. The final
design is proven highly effective in driving down variance at the same time
controlling bias. It is empowering our daily practice and hopefully can also
benefit other applications in the industry.

coherent response of the LIGO-Virgo network of detectors is estimated by using
loose bounds on the duration and bandwidth of the signal. This pipeline version
reproduces the same results that are reported for cWB in recent publications by

on such deviations and present the methods devised to assess their
significance. Out of the eleven events reported in the GWTC-1, in two cases --
GW151012 and GW151226 -- cWB detects an excess of coherent energy after the

improved the quality of synthesized speech. Prominent methods (e.g., Tacotron
2) usually first generate mel-spectrogram from text, and then synthesize speech
from the mel-spectrogram using vocoder such as WaveNet. Compared with
traditional concatenative and statistical parametric approaches, neural network
based end-to-end models suffer from slow inference speed, and the synthesized
speech is usually not robust (i.e., some words are skipped or repeated) and
lack of controllability (voice speed or prosody control). In this work, we
propose a novel feed-forward network based on Transformer to generate
mel-spectrogram in parallel for TTS. Specifically, we extract attention
alignments from an encoder-decoder based teacher model for phoneme duration
prediction, which is used by a length regulator to expand the source phoneme
sequence to match the length of the target mel-spectrogram sequence for
parallel mel-spectrogram generation. Experiments on the LJSpeech dataset show
that our parallel model matches autoregressive models in terms of speech
quality, nearly eliminates the problem of word skipping and repeating in
particularly hard cases, and can adjust voice speed smoothly. Most importantly,
compared with autoregressive Transformer TTS, our model speeds up
mel-spectrogram generation by 270x and the end-to-end speech synthesis by 38x.
Therefore, we call our model FastSpeech.

changes that not only recover the original level of function (locomotion) as
before, but can in fact surpass the original level of performance (speed). This
suggests that shape change, instead of control readaptation, may be a better
method to recover function after damage in some cases.

position of a quantum walker is indisputable. The creation of bipartite
entanglement has also been reported for two-walker systems. In this scenario,
however, since the global state lies in a fourpartite Hilbert space, the
question arises as to whether genuine multipartite entanglement may develop in
time. Also, since the spatial degrees of freedom can be viewed as a noisy
channel for the two-spin part, one may wonder how other nonclassical aspects,
such as Bell nonlocality, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, quantum discord,
and symmetrical quantum discord, evolve in time during the walk. The lack of
analytical and numerical evidences which would allow one to address these
questions is possibly due to the usual computational difficulties associated
with the recursive nature of quantum walks. Here, we work around this issue by
introducing a simplified Gaussian model which proves to be very accurate within
a given domain and powerful for analytical studies. Then, for an instance
involving two noninteracting quantum walkers, whose spins start in the singlet
state, we quantify the aforementioned nonclassical features as a function of
time, and evaluate violations of both realism and related aspects of locality.
In addition, we analyze situations in which the initial two-spin state is
affected by white noise. The typical scenario found is such that while genuine
fourpartite entanglement increases over time, all the investigated nonclassical
features vanish (suddenly or asymptotically) except realism-based nonlocality.
Moreover, realism is prevented for all finite times. Our findings open
perspectives for the understanding of the dynamics of quantum resources in
quantum walks.

population of dark matter with mass below the GeV scale. However, such dark
matter can be produced copiously in supernovae. Since this thermally-produced
population is much hotter than the galactic dark matter, it can be observed
with direct detection experiments. In this paper, we focus on a dark sector
with fermion dark matter and a heavy dark photon as a specific example. We
first extend existing supernova cooling constraints on this model to the regime
of strong coupling where the dark matter becomes diffusively trapped in the
supernova. Then, using the fact that even outside these cooling constraints the
diffuse galactic flux of these dark sector particles can still be large, we
show that this flux is detectable in direct detection experiments such as
current and next-generation liquid xenon detectors. As a result, due to
supernova production, light dark matter has the potential to be discovered over
many orders of magnitude of mass and coupling.

enrichment from the Sun's galactic migration or birth cluster could resolve
this. Meanwhile, a distant, low-eccentricity 5 Earth-mass planet replicates the
observed fraction of highly inclined scatterers, but the overall inclination

generates a longitudinal asymmetry among detached TNOs that is less extreme

spanned by known TNOs. More complete models that explore the dynamical origins
of the planet are necessary to further study these features. With observational

stellar protoclusters may be completely mass segregated at birth. Independent

the primordial mass segregation seems to be lost over time, we aim to study on
which timescale an initially perfectly mass-segregated star cluster becomes
indistinguishable from an initially not mass-segregated cluster. As an example,
the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is also discussed. We used $N$-body simulations
of star clusters with various masses and two different degrees of primordial
mass segregation. We analysed their energy redistribution through two-body
relaxation to quantify the time when the models agree in terms of mass
segregation, which sets in only dynamically in the models that are primordially
not mass segregated. A comprehensive cross-matched catalogue combining optical,
infrared, and X-ray surveys of ONC members was also compiled and made
available. The models evolve to a similar radial distribution of high-mass
stars after the core collapse (about half a median two-body relaxation time,
$t_\mathrm{rh}$) and become observationally indistinguishable from the point of
view of mass segregation at time $\tau_\mathrm{v} \approx 3.3\,t_\mathrm{rh}$.
In the case of the ONC, using the distribution of high-mass stars, we may not
rule out either evolutionary scenario (regardless of whether they are initially
mass segregated). When we account for extinction and elongation of the ONC, as
reported elsewhere, an initially perfectly mass-segregated state seems to be
more consistent with the observed cluster.

new overdensity candidates with precisely measured redshifts and an
unprecedented sensitivity down to low total overdensity masses

regression for interpolating the log-probability. This allows for easy
resampling, importance sampling, marginalization, testing different samplers,
investigating chain convergence, and other operations. As an example use-case,
we reconstruct the posterior distribution of the most recent Planck 2018

about 20 orbits before merger, includes all $\ell \leq 4$ spin-weighted
spherical harmonic modes, as well as the precession frame dynamics and spin

the mass, spin, and recoil kick velocity of the remnant black hole. In their
training parameter range, both models are shown to be more accurate than
existing models by at least an order of magnitude, with errors comparable to

the surrogate models work well even when extrapolated outside their training

the attractive and repulsive interactions in the VDWHRG model have been
extracted by fitting the $\sigma^{2}$/$M$, $\it{S}\sigma$ and
$\kappa\sigma^{2}$, where $M$ is the mean, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation,
$\it{S}$ is the skewness and $\kappa$ the kurtosis of the net-proton

strength of the repulsive interactions increases with decrease in
$\sqrt{\mathrm {s_{NN}}}$ = 200 to 19.6 GeV while the strength of the
attractive interaction is of the similar magnitude. For $\sqrt{\mathrm

the other hand, if we consider only the higher order moment products,
$\it{S}\sigma$ and $\kappa\sigma^{2}$, which are more sensitive to critical
point physics, a segregation with respect to the strength of the attractive
parameter is observed. The data for $\sqrt{\mathrm {s_{NN}}}$ = 19.6 and 27 GeV

the moduli space $\M_2$ of Riemann surfaces of genus 2. While the
classification of primitive Teichm\""uller curves in $\M_2$ is complete, the
classification of the imprimitive curves, which is related to branched torus
covers and square-tiled surfaces, remains open.
  Conjecturally, the classification is completed as follows. Let $W_{d^2}[n]
\subset \M_2$ be the 1-dimensional subvariety consisting of those $X \in \M_2$
that admit a primitive degree $d$ holomorphic map $\pi: X \to E$ to an elliptic
curve $E$, branched over torsion points of order $n$. It is known that every
imprimitive Teichm\""uller curve in $\M_2$ is a component of some $W_{d^2}[n]$.
The {\em parity conjecture} states that (with minor exceptions) $W_{d^2}[n]$
has two components when $n$ is odd, and one when $n$ is even. In particular,
the number of components of $W_{d^2}[n]$ does not depend on $d$.
  In this work we establish the parity conjecture in the following three cases:
(1) for all $n$ when $d=2,3,4,5$; (2) when $d$ and $n$ are prime and $n >
(d^3-d)/4$; and (3) when $d$ is prime and $n > C_d$, where $C_d$ is an implicit
constant that depends on $d$.
  In the course of the proof we will see that the modular curve $X(d) =
\overline{\Hyp \big/ \Gamma(d)}$ is itself a square-tiled surface equipped with
a natural action of $\SLZ$. The parity conjecture is equivalent to the
classification of the finite orbits of this action. It is also closely related
to the following {\em illumination conjecture}: light sources at the cusps of
the modular curve illuminate all of $X(d)$, except possibly some vertices of
the square-tiling. Our results show that the illumination conjecture is true
for $d \le 5$.

application is to couple the global symmetries of the system (including the
Poincar\'{e} symmetry) to background gauge fields (and a metric for the
Poincar\'{e} symmetry). Failure of gauge invariance of the partition function
under gauge transformations of these fields reflects 't Hooft anomalies. It is
also common to view the ordinary (scalar) coupling constants as background
fields, i.e. to study the theory when they are spacetime dependent. We will
show that the notion of 't Hooft anomalies can be extended naturally to include
these scalar background fields. Just as ordinary 't Hooft anomalies allow us to
deduce dynamical consequences about the phases of the theory and its defects,
the same is true for these generalized 't Hooft anomalies. Specifically, since
the coupling constants vary, we can learn that certain phase transitions must
be present. We will demonstrate these anomalies and their applications in
simple pedagogical examples in one dimension (quantum mechanics) and in some
two, three, and four-dimensional quantum field theories. An anomaly is an
example of an invertible field theory, which can be described as an object in
(generalized) differential cohomology. We give an introduction to this
perspective. Also, we use Quillen's superconnections to derive the anomaly for
a free spinor field with variable mass. In a companion paper we will study

system having infinite extent in the horizontal directions, but with a finite
width in the vertical direction, this theory predicts that the inertial range
can display three possible scaling behaviour, which are essentially
parametrised by the buoyancy frequency $N$, or dimensionless horizontal Froude
number $F_h$, and the vertical length scale $l_v$ that sets the scale of
variation of the velocity field in the vertical direction, for a fixed Reynolds
number. For very low $N$ or very high $Re_b$ or $F_h$, and with $l_v$ being of
the same order as $l_h$, the typical horizontal length scale, buoyancy forces
are irrelevant and hence, unsurprisingly, the kinetic energy spectra shows the
well-known K41 scaling in the inertial range. In this regime, the local
temperature behaves as a passively advected scalar, without any effect on the
flow fields. For intermediate ranges of values of $N,\,F_h\sim {\cal O}(1)$,
corresponding to moderate stratification, buoyancy forces are important enough
to affect the scaling. This leads to the Bolgiano-Obukhov scaling which is
isotropic, when $l_v\sim l_h$. Finally, for very large $N$ or equivalently for
vanishingly small $F_h,\,L_o$, corresponding to strong stratification, together
with a very small $l_v$, the system effectively two-dimensionalise; the kinetic
energy spectrum is predicted to be anisotropic with only the horizontal part of
the kinetic energy spectra follows the K41 scaling, suggesting an intriguing
{\em re-entrant} K41 scaling, as a function of stratification, for ${\bf
v}_\perp$ in this regime. The scaling theory further predicts the scaling of
the thermal energy in each of these three scaling regimes. Our theory can be
tested in large scale simulations and appropriate laboratory-based experiments.

solar corona and the slow speed solar wind. Both are subject to the First
Ionization Potential (FIP) Effect, the enhancement in coronal abundance of
elements with FIP below 10 eV (e.g. Mg, Si, Fe) with respect to high FIP
elements (e.g. O, Ne, Ar), but with subtle differences. Intermediate elements,
S, P, and C, with FIP just above 10 eV, behave as high FIP elements in closed
loops, but are fractionated more like low FIP elements in the solar wind. On
the basis of FIP fractionation by the ponderomotive force in the chromosphere,
we discuss fractionation scenarios where this difference might originate.
Fractionation low in the chromosphere where hydrogen is neutral enhances the S,
P and C abundances. This arises with nonresonant waves, which are ubiquitous in
open field regions, and is also stronger with torsional Alfven waves, as
opposed to shear (i.e. planar) waves. We discuss the bearing these findings
have on models of interchange reconnection as the source of the slow speed
solar wind. The outflowing solar wind must ultimately be a mixture of the
plasma in the originally open and closed fields, and the proportions and degree
of mixing should depend on details of the reconnection process. We also
describe novel diagnostics in ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet spectroscopy
now available with these new insights, with the prospect of investigating slow
speed solar wind origins and the contribution of interchange reconnection by
remote sensing.

to an individual power constraint. Furthermore, ultra-reliable and low-latency
communication are desired. The latter requirement translates to considering
only schemes that make use of local channel state information. Whereas for a
receiver equipped with a single antenna, distributed beamforming is a well
known and adequate solution, no straightforward extension is known. In this
paper, a scheme is proposed based on a space-time diversity transformation that
is applied as a front-end operation at the destination node. This results in an
effective unitary channel matrix replacing the scalar coefficient corresponding
to each user. Each relay node then inverts its associated channel matrix, which
is the generalization of undoing the channel phase in the classical case of
distributed beamforming to a single-antenna receiver, and then repeats the
message over the resulting ""gain-only"" channel. In comparison to a
single-antenna destination node, the method doubles the diversity order without
requiring any channel state information at the receiver while at the same time
retaining the array gain offered by the relays.

nanomagnets is an extremely energy-efficient switching methodology for
(magnetic) binary switches that has recently attracted widespread attention
because of its potential application in ultra-low-power digital computing
hardware. Unfortunately, this modality of switching is also error very prone at
room temperature. Theoretical studies of switching error probability of
magneto-elastic switches have predicted probabilities ranging from 10E-8-10E-3
at room temperature for ideal, defect-free nanomagnets, but experiments with
real nanomagnets show a much higher probability that exceeds 0.1 in some cases.
The obvious spoilers that can cause this large difference are defects and
non-idealities. Here, we have theoretically studied the effect of common
defects (that occur during fabrication) on magneto-elastic switching
probability in the presence of room-temperature thermal noise. Surprisingly, we
found that even small defects increase the switching error probabilities by
orders of magnitude. There is usually a critical stress that leads to the
lowest error probability and its value increases enormously in the presence of
defects. All this could limit or preclude the application of magneto-elastic
(straintronic) binary switches in either Boolean logic or memory, despite their
excellent energy-efficiency, and restrict them to non-Boolean (e.g.
neuromorphic, stochastic) computing applications. We also studied the
difference between magneto-elastic switching with a stress pulse of constant
amplitude and sinusoidal time-varying amplitude (e.g. due to a surface acoustic
wave) and found that the latter method is more reliable and generates lower
switching error probabilities in most cases, provided the time variation is
reasonably slow.

analysing the language of QM by using some elementary but fundamental tools of
mathematical logic. Our approach proves that some widespread beliefs about QM
can be questioned and establishes new links with a classical view, which is
significant in the debate on the interpretations of QM. We propose here a brief
survey of our results, highlighting their common background. We firstly show
how quantum logic (QL) can be embedded into classical logic (CL) if the
embedding is required to preserve the logical order and not the algebraic
structure, and also how QL can be interpreted as a pragmatic sublanguage within
a pragmatic extension of CL. Both these results challenge the thesis that CL
and QL formalize the properties of different and incompatible notions of truth.
We then show that quantum probability admits an epistemic interpretation if
contextuality is taken into account as a basic constituent of the language of
QM, which overcomes the interpretation of quantum probability as ontic.
Finally, we show that the proofs that QM is a contextual theory stand on a
supplementary epistemological assumption that is usually unnoticed and left
implicit. Dropping such assumption opens the way, at least in principle, to
non-contextual interpretations of QM.

Recently, however, the research community has begun to address some of these
shortcomings by offering algorithmic solutions that enable imitation learning
from observation (IfO), e.g., learning to perform a task from visual
demonstrations that may be in a different environment and do not include
actions. Motivated by the fact that agents often also have access to their own
internal states (i.e., proprioception), we propose and study an IfO algorithm
that leverages this information in the policy learning process. The proposed
architecture learns policies over proprioceptive state representations and
compares the resulting trajectories visually to the demonstration data. We
experimentally test the proposed technique on several MuJoCo domains and show
that it outperforms other imitation from observation algorithms by a large
margin.

(3) a measurement of the velocity dispersion of the lens galaxy based on

time-delay distance to be $4784_{-248}^{+399}~\mathrm{Mpc}$, an average

However, histological processing is associated with tissue distortion and
fixation artifacts, which prevent a direct comparison between the two

celloidin embedding that reduces the amount of artifacts and yields high
quality whole brain histological slices. Celloidin embedded tissue,
nevertheless, still bears distortions that must be corrected. We propose a

we report the accuracy of our pipeline in two whole brain volumes from the

security becomes a critical concern, and the users should invest to secure
their IoT applications. Due to the massive devices in the IoT network, users
cannot be aware of the security policies taken by all its connected neighbors.
Instead, a user makes security decisions based on the cyber risks he perceives
by observing a selected number of nodes. To this end, we propose a model which
incorporates the limited attention or bounded rationality nature of players in
the IoT. Specifically, each individual builds a sparse cognitive network of
nodes to respond to. Based on this simplified cognitive network representation,
each user then determines his security management policy by minimizing his own
real-world security cost. The bounded rational decision-makings of players and
their cognitive network formations are interdependent and thus should be
addressed in a holistic manner. We establish a games-in-games framework and
propose a Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE) solution concept to characterize the
decisions of agents, and quantify their risk of bounded perception due to the
limited attention. In addition, we design a proximal-based iterative algorithm
to compute the GNE. With case studies of smart communities, the designed
algorithm can successfully identify the critical users whose decisions need to
be taken into account by the other users during the security management.

introduce the concept of congruence on these posets and show when the quotient

generalized ordinal sum which enables us to construct the Dedekind-MacNeille

the cen+N mass suffers less from projection effects in the UniverseMachine

considering a subset of outcomes for each state-action pair. This reduction in
reachable states leads to replanning when the agent encounters states without a
precomputed action during plan execution. However, not all states are suitable
for replanning. In the worst case, the agent may not be able to reach the goal
from the newly encountered state. Agents should be better prepared to handle
such risky situations and avoid replanning in risky states. Hence, we consider
replanning in states that are unsafe for deliberation as a negative side effect
of planning with reduced models. While the negative side effects can be
minimized by always using the full model, this defeats the purpose of using
reduced models. The challenge is to plan with reduced models, but somehow
account for the possibility of encountering risky situations. An agent should
thus only replan in states that the user has approved as safe for replanning.
To that end, we propose planning using a portfolio of reduced models, a
planning paradigm that minimizes the negative side effects of planning using
reduced models by alternating between different outcome selection approaches.
We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three domains:
an electric vehicle charging domain using real-world data from a university
campus and two benchmark planning problems.

Standard online learning assumes a finite number of samples while in practice

the performance of an algorithm on every fixed number of contiguous samples. At
the same time, we propose a family of algorithms based on gradient descent with
a constant or adaptive learning rate and provide very technical analyses
establishing regret bound properties of the algorithms. We cover the convex
setting showing the regret of the order of the square root of the size of the

applicable also to the standard online setting where we provide the first
analysis of the same regret order (the previous proofs have flaws). We also
study a two layer neural network setting with ReLU activation. In this case we
establish that if initial weights are close to a stationary point, the same
square root regret bound is attainable. We conduct computational experiments

individuals that have poor errors on some training cases, if they have great
errors on others and those errors come near the start of the random list of

selecting these specialists, which may have poor total error, plays an
important role in lexicase selection's observed performance advantages over
error-aggregating parent selection methods such as tournament selection, which
select specialists much less frequently. We conduct experiments examining this

novelty search suffers from lack of direction toward a goal, especially in
unconstrained, highly-dimensional spaces. We combine the strengths of lexicase
selection and novelty search by creating a novelty score for each test case,
and adding those novelty scores to the normal error values used in lexicase
selection. We use this new novelty-lexicase selection to solve automatic
program synthesis problems, and find it significantly outperforms both novelty
search and lexicase selection. Additionally, we find that novelty search has
very little success in the problem domain of program synthesis. We explore the
effects of each of these methods on population diversity and long-term problem
solving performance, and give evidence to support the hypothesis that
novelty-lexicase selection resists converging to local optima better than
lexicase selection.

fine-tuning these networks on small datasets of real human decisions results in
unprecedented state-of-the-art improvements on two benchmark datasets. Second,
we present the first large-scale dataset for human decision-making, containing

reveals the circumstances where cognitive model priors are useful, and provides
a new standard for benchmarking prediction of human decisions under

3-D global climate model simulations with a dynamic ocean is performed with
Earthlike atmospheres for low and high obliquity planets with various stellar
fluxes, CO2 concentrations, and initial conditions to explore the propensity
for high obliquity climates approaching the outer edge of the Habitable Zone to
undergo global glaciation. We also simulate planets with thick CO2 or H2
atmospheres, such as those expected to develop near or beyond the outer edge of
the Habitable Zone.
  We show that high obliquity planets are hotter than their low obliquity
counterparts due to ice-albedo feedbacks for cold climates, and water vapor in
warm climates. We suggest that the water vapor greenhouse trapping is greater
on high obliquity bodies due to the different dynamical regimes that occur
between the two states.
  While equatorial ice-belts are stable at high obliquity in some climate
regimes, it is harder to achieve global glaciation than for a low obliquity
planet. Temperate polar conditions can be present at high obliquity at forcings
for which low obliquity planets would be in a hard snowball state. We suggest
the conditions on high obliquity planets are likely to be more favorable for a
robust biosphere to develop approaching the outer edge of the HZ. However, the
influence of obliquity diminishes for dense atmospheres, in agreement with
calculations from 1-D Energy Balance Models.

An understanding of multimedia signals allows recognizing events of daily

paper, we consider the problem of recognizing a daily event by employing the
commonly used multimedia data obtained from a smartphone and wearable device.
We develop an unobtrusive approach to obtain latent semantic information from

semantic context enrichment. We represent the enrichment process through an
event knowledge graph that semantically enriches a daily event from a low-level
daily activity. To show a concrete example of this enrichment, we perform an
experiment with eating activity, which may be one of the most complex events,
by using 14 months of data for three users. In this process, to unobtrusively
complement the lack of semantic information, we suggest a new food
recognition/classification method that focuses only on a physical response to
food consumption. Experimental results indicate that our approach is able to
show automatic abstraction of life experience. These daily events can then be
used to create a personal model that can capture how a person reacts to
different stimuli under specific conditions.

become supernovae, but the explosion mechanism is unclear. The answer depends
critically on the rate of electron capture on $^{20}$Ne in the degenerate
oxygen-neon stellar core. However, due to the unknown strength of the
transition between the ground states of $^{20}$Ne and $^{20}$F, it has not
previously been possible to fully constrain the rate. By measuring the
transition, we have established that its strength is exceptionally large and
enhances the capture rate by several orders of magnitude. This has a decisive
impact on the evolution of the core, increasing the likelihood that the star is
(partially) disrupted by a thermonuclear explosion rather than collapsing to
form a neutron star. Importantly, our measurement resolves the last remaining
nuclear physics uncertainty in the final evolution of degenerate oxygen-neon
stellar cores, allowing future studies to address the critical role of

known from theory, simulations and colloidal experiments to exhibit dynamical
reentrance. The liquid state can thus be fluidized to higher densities than
otherwise possible with interactions that are purely repulsive or long-ranged
attractive. A recent mean-field, infinite-dimensional calculation predicts that
the dynamical arrest of the fluid can be further delayed by adding a
longer-ranged repulsive contribution to the short-ranged attraction. We examine
this proposal by performing extensive numerical simulations in a
three-dimensional system. We first find the short-ranged attraction parameters
necessary to achieve the densest liquid state, and then explore the parameters
space for an additional longer-ranged repulsion that could enhance the effect.
In the family of systems studied, no significant (within numerical accuracy)
delay of the dynamical arrest is observed beyond what is already achieved by
the short-ranged attraction. Possible explanations are discussed.

Dependence (LRD) --- referring to long-range correlations decaying as a power

been widely conjectured that LRD is present in language modeling and sequential

a principled estimation procedure of LRD in sequential datasets based on

misaligned with the disk by 8 degree. It is spiraling inwards and expected to
transform into a rotating disk at ~ 20 au, consistent with the disk radius
estimated before. It appears to have a constant specific angular momentum and
itself can result from an inside-out collapse of an extended envelope detected
before in NH$_3$. In the flattened envelope, the polarization is mainly due to
the magnetically aligned dust grains, inferring a highly pinched poloidal field
morphology there. Thus, both the kinematics and field morphology support that
the flattened envelope is a pseudodisk formed as the infalling gas is guided by
the field lines to the equatorial plane. Interestingly, a point symmetric
polarization distribution is also seen in the flattened envelope, implying that
the pinched field lines also have a significant toroidal component generated by
the rotation. No significant loss of angular momentum and thus no clear
magnetic braking are detected in the flattened envelope around the disk
probably because of the large misalignment between the axis of the rotation and

Facebook and Sina Weibo. Among many real-world advertising and feed ranking
systems, click through rate (CTR) prediction plays a central role. There are
many proposed models in this field such as logistic regression, tree based
models, factorization machine based models and deep learning based CTR models.
However, many current works calculate the feature interactions in a simple way
such as Hadamard product and inner product and they care less about the
importance of features. In this paper, a new model named FiBiNET as an
abbreviation for Feature Importance and Bilinear feature Interaction NETwork is
proposed to dynamically learn the feature importance and fine-grained feature
interactions. On the one hand, the FiBiNET can dynamically learn the importance
of features via the Squeeze-Excitation network (SENET) mechanism; on the other
hand, it is able to effectively learn the feature interactions via bilinear
function. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and show
that our shallow model outperforms other shallow models such as factorization
machine(FM) and field-aware factorization machine(FFM). In order to improve
performance further, we combine a classical deep neural network(DNN) component
with the shallow model to be a deep model. The deep FiBiNET consistently
outperforms the other state-of-the-art deep models such as DeepFM and extreme
deep factorization machine(XdeepFM).

high quality Question Answering (QA) datasets have become available. Despite
state-of-the-art methods achieving strong overall accuracy, Multi-Hop (MH)
reasoning remains particularly challenging. To address MH-QA specifically, we
propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning based method capable of learning
sequential reasoning across large collections of documents so as to pass a
query-aware, fixed-size context subset to existing models for answer
extraction. Our method is comprised of two stages: a linker, which decomposes
the provided support documents into a graph of sentences, and an extractor,
which learns where to look based on the current question and already-visited
sentences. The result of the linker is a novel graph structure at the sentence
level that preserves logical flow while still allowing rapid movement between
documents. Importantly, we demonstrate that the sparsity of the resultant graph
is invariant to context size. This translates to fewer decisions required from
the Deep-RL trained extractor, allowing the system to scale effectively to
large collections of documents.
  The importance of sequential decision making in the document traversal step
is demonstrated by comparison to standard IE methods, and we additionally
introduce a BM25-based IR baseline that retrieves documents relevant to the
query only. We examine the integration of our method with existing models on
the recently proposed QAngaroo benchmark and achieve consistent increases in
accuracy across the board, as well as a 2-3x reduction in training time.

dimension-reduced generalized approximate message passing (DR-GAMP) approach is
proposed. Firstly, the spectrum of one-bit quantized signals in a scenario with
multiple targets is analyzed. It is indicated that high-order harmonics may
result in false alarms (FAs) and cannot be neglected. Secondly, based on the
spectrum analysis, the DR-GAMP approach is proposed to carry out target

are firstly adopted to perform the dimension reduction, and then, the GAMP
algorithm is utilized to suppress high-order harmonics and recover true

performance of one-bit LFMCW radar under typical parameters. It is shown that
compared to the conventional radar applying linear processing methods, one-bit
LFMCW radar has about $1.3$ dB performance gain when the input signal-to-noise

data has recently attracted much attention. Various methods based on functional
causal models have been proposed to solve this problem, by assuming the causal
process satisfies some (structural) constraints and showing that the reverse
direction violates such constraints. The nonlinear additive noise model has
been demonstrated to be effective for this purpose, but the model class is not
transitive--even if each direct causal relation follows this model, indirect
causal influences, which result from omitted intermediate causal variables and
are frequently encountered in practice, do not necessarily follow the model
constraints; as a consequence, the nonlinear additive noise model may fail to
correctly discover causal direction. In this work, we propose a cascade
nonlinear additive noise model to represent such causal influences--each direct
causal relation follows the nonlinear additive noise model but we observe only
the initial cause and final effect. We further propose a method to estimate the
model, including the unmeasured intermediate variables, from data, under the
variational auto-encoder framework. Our theoretical results show that with our
model, causal direction is identifiable under suitable technical conditions on
the data generation process. Simulation results illustrate the power of the
proposed method in identifying indirect causal relations across various
settings, and experimental results on real data suggest that the proposed model
and method greatly extend the applicability of causal discovery based on
functional causal models in nonlinear cases.

demand for high-definition wireless video streaming. By prefetching popular
content into memory at wireless access points or end-user devices, requests can
be served locally, relieving strain on expensive backhaul. In addition, using
network coding allows the simultaneous serving of distinct cache misses via
common coded multicast transmissions, resulting in significantly larger load
reductions compared to those achieved with traditional delivery schemes. Most
prior works simply treat video content as fixed-size files that users would
like to fully download. This work is motivated by the fact that video can be
coded in a scalable fashion and that the decoded video quality depends on the
number of layers a user receives in sequence. Using a Gaussian source model,
caching and coded delivery methods are designed to minimize the squared error
distortion at end-user devices in a rate-limited caching network. The framework
is very general and accounts for heterogeneous cache sizes, video popularities
and user-file play-back qualities. As part of the solution, a new decentralized
scheme for lossy cache-aided delivery subject to preset user distortion targets
is proposed, which further generalizes prior literature to a setting with file

over-parameterization, a huge amount of parameters makes deep networks
cumbersome in daily life applications. Though techniques such as pruning and
distillation are developed, they are expensive in fully training a dense
network as backward selection methods, and there is still a void on
systematically exploring forward selection methods for learning structural
sparsity in deep networks. To fill in this gap, this paper proposes a new
approach based on differential inclusions of inverse scale spaces, which
generate a family of models from simple to complex ones along the dynamics via
coupling a pair of parameters, such that over-parameterized deep models and
their structural sparsity can be explored simultaneously. This kind of
differential inclusion scheme has a simple discretization, dubbed Deep
structure splitting Linearized Bregman Iteration (DessiLBI), whose global
convergence in learning deep networks could be established under the
Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz framework. Experimental evidence shows that our method
achieves comparable and even better performance than the competitive optimizers

`winning tickets' in early epochs: the effective sparse network structures with

neural networks are the high parameter overhead that makes them infeasible on
large networks, and the difficulty of implementation, which can be thought of

because it sidesteps these obstacles. Nevertheless, dropout is often harmful to
model performance when used in networks with batch normalization layers [Li et
al., 2018], which are an indispensable part of modern neural networks. We
construct a general variational family for ensemble-based Bayesian neural

while retaining the benefits of low parameter and programming overhead,
comparable to non-Bayesian training. Our proposed methods improve predictive

  Vector-by-Matrix Multiplier Exploiting 1T-1R Arrays",,,,,"eess.SP cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The emerging mobile devices in this era of internet-of-things (IoT) require a
dedicated processor to enable computationally intensive applications such as
neuromorphic computing and signal processing. Vector-by-matrix multiplication
(VMM) is the most prominent operation in these applications. Therefore, there
is a critical need for compact and ultralow-power VMM blocks to perform
resource-intensive low-to-moderate precision computations. To this end, in this
work, for the first time, we propose a time-domain mixed-signal VMM exploiting
a modified configuration of 1MOSFET-1RRAM (1T-1R) array. The proposed VMM
overcomes the energy inefficiency of the current-mode VMM approaches based on
RRAMs. A rigorous analysis of the different non-ideal factors affecting the
computational precision indicates that the non-negligible minimum cell
currents, channel length modulation (CLM) and drain-induced barrier lowering
(DIBL) are the dominant mechanisms degrading the precision of the proposed VMM.
Our results also indicate that there exists a trade-off between the
computational precision, dynamic range, and the area- and energy-efficiency of
the proposed VMM approach. Therefore, we provide the necessary design
guidelines for optimizing the performance. Our preliminary results show that an
effective computational precision of 6-bits is achievable owing to an inherent
compensation effect in the modified 1T-1R blocks. Furthermore, a 4-bit 200x200
VMM utilizing the proposed approach exhibits a significantly high energy
efficiency of ~1.5 POps/J and a throughput of 2.5 TOps/s including the
contribution from the input/output (I/O) circuitry.

ultracold neutron (UCN) source capable of delivering an extracted UCN rate of

around three-orders-of-magnitude higher than existing sources, is presented.
This UCN-current-optimized source would dramatically improve cutting-edge UCN
measurements that are currently statistically limited. A novel ""Inverse
Geometry"" design is used with 40 L of superfluid $^4$He (He-II), which acts as
a converter of cold neutrons (CNs) to UCNs, cooled with state-of-the-art
sub-cooled cryogenic technology to $\sim$1.6 K. Our design is optimized for a
100 W maximum heat load constraint on the He-II and its vessel. In our
geometry, the spallation target is wrapped symmetrically around the UCN
converter to permit raster scanning the proton beam over a relatively large
volume of tungsten spallation target to reduce the demand on the cooling
requirements, which makes it reasonable to assume that water edge-cooling only
is sufficient. Our design is refined in several steps to reach
$P_{UCN}=2.1\times10^9\,/$s under our other restriction of 1 MW maximum
available proton beam power. We then study effects of the He-II scattering
kernel as well as reductions in $P_{UCN}$ due to pressurization to reach
$P_{UCN}=1.8\times10^9\,/$s. Finally, we provide a design for the UCN
extraction system that takes into account the required He-II heat transport
properties and implementation of a He-II containment foil that allows UCN
transmission. We estimate a total useful UCN current from our source of
$R_{use}=5\times10^8\,/$s from a 18 cm diameter guide 5 m from the source.
Under a conservative ""no return"" approximation, this rate can produce an
extracted density of $>1\times10^4\,/$cm$^3$ in $<$1000~L external experimental

The instability disappears when the coupling parameter becomes non-negative.
With the increase of the coupling parameter, the violation of the strong cosmic
censorship occurs at a larger critical charge ratio. But such an increase of
the critical charge is suppressed by the increase of the cosmological constant.
Different from the minimal coupling situation, it is possible to accommodate
$\beta\ge1$ in the near extremal black hole when the scalar field is
non-minimally coupled to curvature. The increase of the cosmological constant
can allow $\beta\ge1$ to be satisfied for even smaller value of the coupling
parameter. The existence of $\beta\ge1$ implies that the resulting curvature

Survey and Chandra Deep Field South fields (${\simeq0.2}~\mathrm{deg}^2$
total). Because slit spectroscopy compresses two-dimensional spatial
information into one spatial dimension, we use Bayesian inference to recover
the underlying Ly$\alpha$ spatial offset distribution. We model the
distribution using a 2D circular Gaussian, defined by a single parameter
$\sigma_{r,\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}$, the standard deviation expressed in polar
coordinates. Over the entire redshift range of our sample ($3<z<5.5$), we find
$\sigma_{r,\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}=1.70^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$ kpc ($68\%$ conf.),
corresponding to $\sim0.25$ arcsec at $\langle z\rangle=4.5$. We also find that
$\sigma_{r,\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}$ decreases significantly with redshift. Because
Ly$\alpha$ spatial offsets can cause slit-losses, the decrease in
$\sigma_{r,\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}$ with redshift can partially explain the increase
in the fraction of Ly$\alpha$ emitters observed in the literature over this
same interval, although uncertainties are still too large to reach a strong
conclusion. If $\sigma_{r,\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}$ continues to decrease into the
reionization epoch, then the decrease in Ly$\alpha$ transmission from galaxies
observed during this epoch might require an even higher neutral hydrogen
fraction than what is currently inferred. Conversely, if spatial offsets
increase with the increasing opacity of the IGM, slit losses may explain some
of the drop in Ly$\alpha$ transmission observed at $z>6$. Spatially resolved
observations of Ly$\alpha$ and UV continuum at $6<z<8$ are needed to settle the
issue.

along with a correlated idler photon from the lower infrared transition. We can
spectrally shape the biphoton state by multiplexing the atomic ensembles with
frequency-shifted emissions, where the entropy of entanglement can be analyzed

when more vapor cells are multiplexed with correlated or anti-correlated signal
and idler fields. The eigenvalues in Schmidt bases approach degenerate under
this multiplexing scheme, and corresponding Schmidt numbers can be larger than
the number of the multiplexed vapor cells, showing the enlarged entropy of
entanglement and excess correlated modes in continuous frequency spaces. We
also investigate the lowest entropy of entanglement allowed in the multiplexing
scheme, which is preferential for generating a pure single photon source. This
shows the potentiality to spectrally shape the biphoton source, where

all terminals are equipped with a single antenna. Further, a communication
protocol is considered where all users transmit at (just below) the symmetric
capacity (per user) of the channel, a rate which is fed back (dictated) to the
users by the base station. Tight bounds are established on the distribution of
the rate attained by the protocol. In particular, these bounds characterize the
probability that the dominant face of the MAC capacity region contains a
symmetric rate point, i.e., that the considered protocol strictly attains the
sum capacity of the channel. The analysis provides a non-asymptotic counterpart
to the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the multiple access channel. Finally,
a practical scheme based on integer-forcing and space-time precoding is shown
to be an effective coding architecture for this communication scenario.

the collective modes in both the transverse and longitudinal sectors. First, we
discuss holographic fluid models, i.e. systems invariant under internal volume
preserving diffeomorphisms. We consider the explicit (EXB) and the spontaneous
(SSB) breaking of translations and we emphasize the differences with respect to
their solid counterpart. Then, we present a study of the longitudinal
collective modes in simple holographic solid and fluid models exhibiting the
interplay between SSB and EXB. We confirm the presence of light pseudo-phonons
obeying the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation and the validity of the relation
proposed in the literature between the novel phase relaxation scale, the mass
of the pseudo-Golstone modes and the Goldstone diffusion. Moreover, we find
very good agreement between the dispersion relation of our longitudinal sound
mode and the formulae derived from the Hydro$+$ framework. Finally, our results
suggest that the crystal diffusion mode does not acquire a simple damping term
because of the novel relaxation scale proportional to the EXB. The dynamics is
more complex and it involves the interplay of three modes: the crystal
diffusion and two more arising from the splitting of the original sound mode.
In this sense, the novel relaxation scale, which comes from the explicit
breaking of the global internal shift symmetry of the St\""uckelberg fields, is
different from the one induced by elastic defects, and depending solely on the
SSB scale.

automated methods are either lacking completely, or are inaccessible to those

to automate the entire analysis process of muscle architecture in ultrasound
images: Simple Muscle Architecture Analysis (SMA). Images are filtered in the
spatial and frequency domains with built-in commands and external plugins to
highlight aponeuroses and fascicles. Fascicle dominant orientation is then
computed in regions of interest using the OrientationJ plugin. Bland-Altman
plots of analyses performed manually or with SMA indicates that the automated

equally through the range of measurements. Our test results illustrate the
suitability of SMA to analyse images from superficial muscles acquired with a

galaxy NGC 1566 using the newly commissioned Australian Square Kilometre Array
Pathfinder (ASKAP) radio telescope. We measure an integrated HI flux density of
$180.2$ Jy km s$^{-1}$ emanating from this galaxy, which translates to an HI
mass of $1.94\times10^{10}$M$_\circ$ at an assumed distance of $21.3$ Mpc. Our
observations show that NGC 1566 has an asymmetric and mildly warped HI disc.
The HI-to-stellar mass fraction of NGC 1566 is $0.29$, which is high in
comparison with galaxies that have the same stellar mass
($10^{10.8}$M$_\circ$). We also derive the rotation curve of this galaxy to a
radius of $50$ kpc and fit different mass models to it. The NFW, Burkert and
pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo profiles fit the observed rotation curve
reasonably well and recover dark matter fractions of $0.62$, $0.58$ and $0.66$,
respectively. Down to the column density sensitivity of our observations
($N_{HI} = 3.7\times10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$), we detect no HI clouds connected to,
or in the nearby vicinity of, the HI disc of NGC 1566 nor nearby interacting
systems. We conclude that, based on a simple analytic model, ram pressure
interactions with the IGM can affect the HI disc of NGC 1566 and is possibly
the reason for the asymmetries seen in the HI morphology of NGC 1566.

bounded size. Equivalently, it is a partition of the vertices into induced
subgraphs with bounded size components. This paper studies clustered colorings
of graphs, where the number of colors depends on an excluded minor and/or an
excluded subgraph. We prove the following results (for fixed integers $s,t$ and
a fixed graph $H$). First we show that graphs with no $K_{s,t}$ subgraph and
with no $H$-minor are $(s+2)$-colorable with bounded clustering. The number of
colors here is best possible. This result implies that graphs with no
$K_{s+1}$-minor are $(s+2)$-colorable with bounded clustering, which is within
two colors of the clustered coloring version of Hadwiger's conjecture. For
graphs of bounded treewidth (or equivalently, excluding a planar minor) and
with no $K_{s,t}$ subgraph, we prove $(s+1)$-choosability with bounded
clustering, which is best possible. We then consider excluding an odd minor. We
prove that graphs with no $K_{s,t}$ subgraph and with no odd $H$-minor are
$(2s+1)$-colorable with bounded clustering, generalizing a result of the first

(CH$_3$OCH$_2$, RDME) are determined using explicitly correlated ab initio
methods. This radical of astrophysical and atmospheric relevance has not been
fully characterized at low temperatures, which has delayed the astrophysical
searches. We provide rovibrational parameters, excitations to the low energy
electronic states, torsional and inversion barriers and low vibrational energy
levels. In the electronic ground state (X$^2$A), which appears ""clean"" from
non-adiabatic effects, the minimum energy structure is an asymmetric geometry
which rotational constants and dipole moment have been determined to be
A$_0$=46718.6745 MHz, B$_0$=10748.4182 MHz, and C$_0$=9272.5105 MHz, and 1.432
D ($\mu_A$=0.6952 D, $\mu_B$=1.215 D, $\mu_C$=0.3016 D), respectively. A
variational procedure has been applied to determine torsion-inversion energy
levels. Each level splits into 3 subcomponents (A$_1$/A$_2$ and E)
corresponding to the three methyl torsion minima. Although the potential energy
surface presents 12 minima, at low temperatures, the infrared band shapes
correspond to a surface with only three minima because the top of the inversion
V$^{\alpha}$ barrier at ${\alpha}=0^{\circ}$ (109 cm$^{-1}$) stands below the
zero point vibrational energy and the CH$_2$ torsional barrier is relatively
high ($\sim$2000 cm$^{-1}$). The methyl torsion barrier was computed to be
$\sim$500 cm$^{-1}$ and produces a splitting of 0.01 cm$^{-1}$ of the ground
vibrational state.

the scheduling of the individual control inputs one at a time in rapid periodic

controller is sparsified via the round-robin scheme and each control action is
scaled appropriately, then the corresponding equilibrium of the resulting
system is stabilized when the scheduling is sufficiently fast; under mild
additional conditions, local asymptotic stabilization of the corresponding

equilibrium of scheduled system also remains same as the original system under
sufficiently fast switching. Our technical tools are derived from optimal
control theory, and our results also contribute to the literature on the

Oscillations are accompanied by periodic switching between edge states with the

analyze by finite-size scaling analysis the datasets of real networks to check
whether purported departures from the power law behavior are due to the
finiteness of the sample size. In this case, power laws would be recovered in
the case of progressively larger cutoffs induced by the size of the sample. We
find that a large number of the networks studied follow a finite size scaling

of each radius, then the problem of determining the range of exponents $(p,q)$
for which the estimate $\| Ef \|_{L^q(X)} \leq C \| f \|_{L^p(S)}$ holds is
equivalent to the restriction conjecture. In this paper, we study the estimate
under the following assumption on the set $X$: there is a number $0 < \alpha

an appropriate weight function $H$, and studying the resulting estimate in
three different regimes: small values of $\alpha$, intermediate values of

single-user decoding, i.e., no successive interference cancellation (SIC). The
minimum product distances of the proposed scheme with arbitrary power

based on lattice partitions of the underlying ideal lattices, whose minimum

not accurately known, the scans are affected by the phenomenon known as motion
distortion. The proposed method leverages preintegration with a continuous
representation of the inertial measurements to characterise the system's motion

without relying on any explicit motion model. The system's pose, velocity,
biases, and time-shift are estimated via a full batch optimisation that
includes automatically generated loop-closure constraints. The autocalibration
and the registration of lidar data rely on planar and edge features matched
across pairs of scans. The performance of the framework is validated through

duration of few- to few-ten attoseconds. But harmonics generated in a gas
medium have attochirps that cannot be fully compensated by materials over a
broad spectral range; thus, realistically what are the typical shortest
attosecond pulses that one can generate? To answer this question, it is
essential that the temporal attosecond pulses be accurately characterized. By
re-analyzing the soft X-ray harmonics reported in three recent experiments
\cite{chang_natcom2017,Thomas_OE2017,Bieger_2017PRX} using a newly developed
broadband phase retrieval algorithm, we show that their generated attosecond
pulses are all longer than about 60 as. Since broadband pulses tend to have
high-order chirps away from the spectral center of the pulse, the algorithm has
to be able to retrieve accurately the phase over the whole bandwidth. Our
re-evaluated pulse durations are found to be longer than those previously
reported. We also introduce the autocorrelation (AC) of the streaking
spectrogram. By comparing the ACs from the experiments and from the retrieved
SXR pulses, the accuracy of the retrieved results can be directly visualized to
ensure that correct phases have been obtained. Our retrieval method is fast and
accurate, and it shall provide a powerful tool for the metrology of
few-ten-attosecond pulses in the future.

execution paths in a systematic manner. Compare to random-mutation-based
fuzzing, concolic execution is especially good at exploring paths that are
guarded by complex and tight branch predicates (e.g., (a*b) == 0xdeadbeef). The
drawback, however, is that concolic execution engines are much slower than
native execution. One major source of the slowness is that concolic execution
engines have to the interpret instructions to maintain the symbolic expression
of program variables. In this work, we propose SynFuzz, a novel approach to
perform scalable concolic execution. SynFuzz achieves this goal by replacing
interpretation with dynamic taint analysis and program synthesis. In
particular, to flip a conditional branch, SynFuzz first uses operation-aware
taint analysis to record a partial expression (i.e., a sketch) of its branch
predicate. Then it uses oracle-guided program synthesis to reconstruct the
symbolic expression based on input-output pairs. The last step is the same as
traditional concolic execution - SynFuzz consults a SMT solver to generate an
input that can flip the target branch. By doing so, SynFuzz can achieve an
execution speed that is close to fuzzing while retain concolic execution's
capability of flipping complex branch predicates. We have implemented a
prototype of SynFuzz and evaluated it with three sets of programs: real-world
applications, the LAVA-M benchmark, and the Google Fuzzer Test Suite (FTS). The
evaluation results showed that SynFuzz was much more scalable than traditional
concolic execution engines, was able to find more bugs in LAVA-M than most
state-of-the-art concolic execution engine (QSYM), and achieved better code
coverage on real-world applications and FTS.

configuration, called Projected Pupil Plane Pattern (PPPP) solves this problem
by launching a collimated laser beam across the full pupil of the telescope. If
using a linear, modal reconstructor, the high laser power requirement
($\sim1000\,\mbox{W}$) renders PPPP uncompetitive with Laser Tomography AO.
This work discusses easing the laser power requirements by using an artificial
Neural Network (NN) as a non-linear reconstructor. We find that the non-linear
NN reduces the required measurement signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) significantly
to reduce PPPP laser power requirements to $\sim200\,\mbox{W}$ for useful
residual wavefront error (WFE). At this power level, the WFE becomes 160\,nm
root mean square (RMS) and 125\,nm RMS when $r_0=0.098$\,m and $0.171$\,m
respectively for turbulence profiles which are representative of conditions at
the ESO Paranal observatory. In addition, it is shown that as a non-linear
reconstructor, a NN can perform useful wavefront sensing using a beam-profile
from one height as the input instead of the two profiles required as a minimum
by the linear reconstructor.

applications. Here, we deploy a near-atomic-scale approach to investigate the
details of the compositional decoration of grain boundaries in the

enrichment in Cr, Mo and B at grain boundaries over the course of the
AM-typical successive solidification and remelting events, accompanied by
solid-state diffusion, causes grain boundary segregation induced liquation.
This observation is consistent with thermodynamic calculations. We demonstrate
that by adjusting build parameters to obtain a fine-grained equiaxed or a
columnar microstructure with grain width smaller than 100 $\mu$m enables to
avoid cracking, despite strong grain boundary segregation. We find that the
spread of critical solutes to a higher total interfacial area, combined with

  We present several novel deep-learning based detectors of malicious

involved photons transfer their energy to the ion and the photoelectron.
However, the transfer of the photon linear momentum is still not fully
understood. Here, we present a time-resolved measurement of linear momentum
transfer along the laser pulse propagation direction. Beyond the limit of the
electric dipole approximation we observe a time-dependent momentum transfer. We
can show that the time-averaged photon radiation pressure picture is not
generally applicable and the linear momentum transfer to the photoelectron
depends on the ionization time within the electromagnetic wave cycle using the
attoclock technique. We can mostly explain the measured linear momentum
transfer within a classical model for a free electron in a laser field.
However, corrections are required due to the interaction of the outgoing
photoelectron with the parent ion and due to the initial momentum when the
electron appears in the continuum. The parent ion interaction induces a
measurable negative attosecond time delay between the appearance in the
continuum of the electron with minimal linear momentum transfer and the point
in time with maximum ionization rate.

the most common fundamental constants owing to its surprisingly large relative
uncertainty, which is attributable mostly to the dispersion of the values
measured for it in different experiments.
  This study focuses on a set of measurements of $G$ that are mutually
inconsistent, in the sense that the dispersion of the measured values is
significantly larger than what their reported uncertainties suggest that it
should be. Furthermore, there is a loosely defined group of measured values
that lie fairly close to a consensus value that may be derived from all the
measurement results, and then there are one or more groups with measured values
farther away from the consensus value, some higher, others lower.
  This same general pattern is often observed in many interlaboratory studies
and meta-analyses. In the conventional treatments of such data, the mutual
inconsistency is addressed by inflating the reported uncertainties, either
multiplicatively, or by the addition of random effects, both reflecting the
presence of dark uncertainty. The former approach is often used by CODATA and
by the Particle Data Group, and the latter is common in medical meta-analysis
and in metrology.
  We propose a new procedure for consensus building that models the results
using latent clusters with different shades of dark uncertainty, which assigns
a customized amount of dark uncertainty to each measured value, as a mixture of
those shades, and does so taking into account both the placement of the
measured values relative to the consensus value, and the reported
uncertainties. We demonstrate this procedure by deriving a new estimate for
$G$, as a consensus value $G = 6.67408 \times 10^{-11} \,\text{m}^{-3} \,

fixed interface thickness, while increasing the ligament radius, i.e. in the

their networks only extract features from a fix-sized subgraph structure (i.e.,
a fix-sized receptive field) of each node, and ignore features in substructures

X-ray blobs illuminating an accretion disc can cause the interference between
two reprocessing-echo components and produce distinct physical features in the
PSD. The oscillatory structures (e.g., dips and humps) are seen but, contrarily
to the lamp-post case, the strongest dip is not always the one at the lowest
frequency. Instead, we find the frequency where the strongest dip is seen
associates to the lower-source height while the lowest frequency where the
first dip appears links with the upper-source height. This is because the
reverberation timescales increase with the source height. Accurate modelling of
the PSD then helps put constraints to the lower and upper limit of the corona
extent. Furthermore, the reverberation signatures are less pronounced with
increasing number of sources that do not produce reflection (e.g., additional
X-rays from fast, relativistic outflows). The amplitude of the oscillations
also depends on the amount of dilution contributed by the X-ray sources, thus
encodes information about their relative brightness. Due to stronger dilutions,
robust detection of these signatures with the current observations will become
even more difficult if the corona is extended. Future observations made by
Athena will enable us to fit these characteristics in statistically significant
details, and to reveal the nature of the disc-corona system.

Karoubi envelope, our higher Karoubi envelope is the closure for absolute
limits. Our construction replaces the idempotents in the ordinary version with
a notion that we call ""condensations."" The name is justified by the direct
physical interpretation of the notion of condensation: it encodes a general
class of constructions which produce a new topological phase of matter by
turning on a commuting projector Hamiltonian on a lattice of defects within a
different topological phase, which may be the trivial phase. We also identify
our higher Karoubi envelopes with categories of fully-dualizable objects.
Together with the Cobordism Hypothesis, we argue that this realizes an
equivalence between a very broad class of gapped topological phases of matter

produced during the execution of a business process in order to predict the
future state or the final outcome of running process instances. Existing
techniques in this field are able to predict, at each step of a process
instance, the likelihood that it will lead to an undesired outcome.These
techniques, however, focus on generating predictions and do not prescribe when
and how process workers should intervene to decrease the cost of undesired
outcomes. This paper proposes a framework for prescriptive process monitoring,
which extends predictive monitoring with the ability to generate alarms that
trigger interventions to prevent an undesired outcome or mitigate its effect.
The framework incorporates a parameterized cost model to assess the
cost-benefit trade-off of generating alarms. We show how to optimize the
generation of alarms given an event log of past process executions and a set of
cost model parameters. The proposed approaches are empirically evaluated using
a range of real-life event logs. The experimental results show that the net
cost of undesired outcomes can be minimized by changing the threshold for
generating alarms, as the process instance progresses. Moreover, introducing
delays for triggering alarms, instead of triggering them as soon as the
probability of an undesired outcome exceeds a threshold, leads to lower net
costs.

The kink instability threshold, which is the maximum twist a kink-stable

and numerical simulations, but still needs to be examined by observations. In
this article, we will study twists released by 30 off-limb rotational solar
coronal jets, and compare the observational findings with theoretical kink
instability thresholds. We have found that: 1) the number of events with more
twist release becomes less; 2) each of the studied jets has released a twist
number of at least 1.3 turns (a twist angle of 2.6$\pi$); and 3) the size of a
jet is highly related to its twist pitch instead of twist number. Our results
suggest that the kink instability threshold in the solar atmosphere should not
be a constant. The found lower limit of twist number of 1.3 turns should be
merely a necessary but not a sufficient condition for a finite solar magnetic
flux rope to become kink unstable.

serve its clustered vehicles with high quality V2V links and forwards safety

model of aggregation of simplexes introduced in I [Sci. Rep., 8:1987, 2018],
here we study topological and spectral properties of a large class of
self-assembled structures consisting of monodisperse building blocks (cliques
of size $n=3,4,5,6$) which self-assemble via sharing the geometrical shapes of
a lower order. The size of the shared sub-structure is tunned by varying the
chemical affinity $\nu$ such that for significant positive $\nu$ sharing the
largest face is the most probable, while for $\nu < 0$, attaching via a single
node dominates. Our results reveal that, while the parameter of hyperbolicity
remains $\delta_{max}=1$ across the assemblies, their structure and spectral
dimension $d_s$ vary with the size of cliques $n$ and the affinity when $\nu
\geq 0$. In this range, we findthat $d_s >4$ can be reached for $n\geq 5$ and
sufficiently large $\nu$. For the aggregates of triangles and tetrahedra, the
spectral dimension remains in the range $d_s\in [2,4)$, as well as for the
higher cliques at vanishing affinity. On the other end, for $\nu < 0$, we find
$d_s\eqsim 1.57$ independently on $n$. Moreover, the spectral distribution of
the normalised Laplacian eigenvalues has a characteristic shape with peaks and
a pronounced minimum, representing the hierarchical architecture of the
simplicial complexes. These findings show how the structures compatible with
complex dynamical properties can be assembled by controlling the higher-order
connectivity among the building blocks.

into lighter mediators which subsequently decay to the Standard Model (SM)
particles. Depending on the coupling strength of the mediator to the SM, the
hidden sector can be kinetically decoupled from the SM bath when the
temperature drops below the mediator's mass, and the dark matter annihilation
cross section at freeze-out is thus possible to be boosted above the
conventional value of weak interacting massive particles. We present a
comprehensive study on thermodynamic evolution of the hidden sector from the
first principle, using the simplest secluded vector dark matter model.
Motivated by the observation of Galactic center gamma-ray excess, we take two
mass sets $\sim{\cal O}(80\, \text{GeV})$ for the dark matter and mediator as
examples to illustrate the thermodynamics. The coupled Boltzmann moment
equations for number densities and temperature evolutions of the hidden sector
are numerically solved. The formalism can be easily extended to a general
secluded dark matter model. We show that a long-lived mediator can result in a
boosted dark matter annihilation cross section to account for the relic
abundance. We further show the parameter space which provides a good fit to the
Galactic center excess data and is compatible with the current bounds and
LUX-ZEPLIN projected sensitivity. We find that the future observations of dwarf
spheroidal galaxies offer promising reach to probe the most relic allowed

Carefully crafted input images (adversarial examples) can force a well-trained

threaten the sustainable use of space, as without removal, space debris will
eventually make certain critical orbits unusable. A central factor affecting
small spacecraft health and leading to debris is the radiation environment,
which is unpredictable due to an incomplete understanding of the near-Earth
radiation environment itself and its variability driven by the solar wind and
outer magnetosphere. This paper presents the FORESAIL-1 nanosatellite mission,
having two scientific and one technological objectives. The first scientific
objective is to measure the energy and flux of energetic particle loss to the
atmosphere with a representative energy and pitch angle resolution over a wide
range of magnetic local times. To pave the way to novel model - in situ data
comparisons, we also show preliminary results on precipitating electron fluxes
obtained with the new global hybrid-Vlasov simulation Vlasiator. The second
scientific objective of the FORESAIL-1 mission is to measure energetic neutral
atoms (ENAs) of solar origin. The solar ENA flux has the potential to
contribute importantly to the knowledge of solar eruption energy budget
estimations. The technological objective is to demonstrate a satellite
de-orbiting technology, and for the first time, make an orbit manoeuvre with a
propellantless nanosatellite. FORESAIL-1 will demonstrate the potential for
nanosatellites to make important scientific contributions as well as promote
the sustainable utilisation of space by using a cost-efficient de-orbiting
technology.

order to use SISR in the first layer of the multiplex network to control CR in

It is then shown that a pronounced SISR cannot only significantly improve a
poor CR, but can also induce a pronounced CR, which was non-existent in the

strong inter-layer coupling forces are found to enhance CR. While long
inter-layer time delays just as long intra-layer time delays, deteriorates CR.
Most importantly, we find that in a strong inter-layer coupling regime, SISR in

data with low-dimensional nature. Subspace Restricted Isometry Property, a
newly-proposed concept, has proved to be a useful tool in analyzing the effect
of dimensionality reduction algorithms on subspaces. In this paper, we provide
a characterization of subspace Restricted Isometry Property, asserting that
matrices which act as a near-isometry on low-dimensional subspaces possess
subspace Restricted Isometry Property. This points out a unified approach to
discuss subspace Restricted Isometry Property. Its power is further
demonstrated by the possibility to prove with this result the subspace RIP for
a large variety of random matrices encountered in theory and practice,
including subgaussian matrices, partial Fourier matrices, partial Hadamard
matrices, partial circulant/Toeplitz matrices, matrices with independent
strongly regular rows (for instance, matrices with independent entries having
uniformly bounded $4+\epsilon$ moments), and log-concave ensembles. Thus our
result could extend the applicability of random projections in subspace-based
machine learning algorithms including subspace clustering and allow for the
application of some useful random matrices which are easier to implement on
hardware or are more efficient to compute.

methods to mitigate disruptive effects of widely deployed H.264 and H.265 video

in the decoding process to eliminate a filtering procedure applied at the

we explore an observational application of the test from the recent GAIA DR2
data release: we select a large sample of $\sim 24,000$ candidate wide binary
stars with distance $< 200$ parsec and magnitudes $G < 16$ from GAIA DR2, and
estimated component masses using a main-sequence mass-luminosity relation. We
then compare the frequency distribution of pairwise relative projected velocity
(relative to circular-orbit value) as a function of projected separation; these
distributions show a clear peak at a value close to Newtonian expectations,
along with a long `tail' which extends to much larger velocity ratios; the
`tail' is considerably more numerous than in control samples constructed from
DR2 with randomised positions, so its origin is unclear. Comparing the velocity
histograms with simulated data, we conclude that MOND-like theories without an
external field effect are strongly inconsistent with the observed data since
they predict a peak-shift in clear disagreement with the data; testing
MOND-like theories with an external field effect is not decisive at present,
but has good prospects to become decisive in future with improved modelling or
understanding of the high-velocity tail, and additional spectroscopic data.

products of singular weight on lattices of square-free level. These belong to a
larger class of Borcherds-Kac-Moody (super)algebras Borcherds obtained by
twisting the denominator identity of the Fake Monster Lie algebra. Borcherds

A D-Lie algebra $\tilde{L}$ is an $A/k$-Lie-Rinehart algebra with a right
$A$-module structure and a canonical central element $D$ satisfying several
conditions. We used this notion to define the universal enveloping algebra of
the category of $\tilde{L}$-connections and to define the cohomology and
homology of an arbitrary connection. In this note we introduce the canonical
quotient $L$ of a D-Lie algebra $\tilde{L}$ and use this to classify D-Lie
algebras where $L$ is projective as $A$-module. We define for any 2-cocycle
$f\in \operatorname{Z}^2(\operatorname{Der}_k(A),A)$ a functor $F_{f}(-)$ from
the category of $A/k$-Lie-Rinehart algebras to the category of D-Lie algebras
and classify D-Lie algebras with projective canoncial quotient using the
functor $F_{f}(-)$. We prove a similar classification for non-abelian
extensions of D-Lie algebras. We classify $\tilde{L}$-connections in the case
when the canonical quotient $L$ of $\tilde{L}$ is projective as $A$-module. Any
$\tilde{L}$-connection is determined by a 2-cocycle $f\in
\operatorname{Z}^2(\operatorname{Der}_k(A),A)$ and an $L$-connection
$(E,\nabla)$. We introduce the correspondence and Chow-operator of an
$\tilde{L}$-connection. The aim of this construction is to relate connections
on D-Lie algebras to algebraic cycles an the category of correspondences. The
Chow-operator cannot be defined for an ordinary connection on an
$A/k$-Lie-Rinehart algebra. It depends in a non-trivial way on the right
$A$-module structure on $\tilde{L}$ and the canonical quotient
$A/k$-Lie-Rinehart algebra $L$ has no such structure.

the Chinese stock market by calibrating the Log Periodic Power Law Singularity
(LPPLS) model to two important Chinese stock indices, SSEC and SZSC, from early
2014 to June 2015. The back tests of the 2015 Chinese stock market bubbles
indicates that the LPPLS model can readily detect the bubble behavior of the
faster-than-exponential increase corrected by the accelerating
logarithm-periodic oscillations in the 2015 Chinese Stock market. The existence
of log-periodicity is detected by applying the Lomb spectral analysis on the
detrended residuals. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck property and the stationarity of
the LPPLS fitting residuals are confirmed by the two Unit-root tests
(Philips-Perron test and Dickery-Fuller test). According to our analysis, the
actual critical day t_c can be well predicted by the LPPLS model as far back as
two months before the actual bubble crash. Compared to the traditional
optimization method used in the LPPLS model, we find the covariance matrix
adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) to have a significantly lower
computation cost, and thus recommend this as a better alternative algorithm for
LPPLS model fit. Furthermore, in the LPPLS fitting with expanding windows, the
gap (tc -t2) shows a significant decrease when the end day t2 approaches the
actual bubble crash time. The change rate of the gap (tc-t2) may be used as an
additional indicator besides the key indicator tc to improve the prediction of
bubble burst.

leverages on a long-tail Cauchy distribution to suppress outlier feature
matches in the odometry constraints, and a Cauchy-Uniform mixture model with a
set of binary latent variables to simultaneously suppress outlier loop-closure
constraints and outlier feature matches in the inlier loop-closure constraints.
Furthermore, we show that by using a Gaussian-Uniform mixture model, our
approach degenerates to the formulation of a state-of-the-art approach for
robust indoor reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach has comparable performance with the state-of-the-art on a benchmark

unit-root tests of the logarithmic residual based on both the Phillips-Perron

minimizes the damages from the bubble crash.

pursuit denoising (BPD) performs noise reduction in this way. However, the
shortcoming of using L1 norm regularization is the underestimation of the true
solution. Recently, a class of non-convex penalties have been proposed to
improve this situation. This kind of penalty function is non-convex itself, but
preserves the convexity property of the whole cost function. This approach has
been confirmed to offer good performance in 1-D signal denoising. This paper
demonstrates the aforementioned method to 2-D signals (images) and applies it
to multisensor image fusion. The problem is posed as an inverse one and a
corresponding cost function is judiciously designed to include two data
attachment terms. The whole cost function is proved to be convex upon suitably
choosing the non-convex penalty, so that the cost function minimization can be
tackled by convex optimization approaches, which comprise simple computations.
The performance of the proposed method is benchmarked against a number of
state-of-the-art image fusion techniques and superior performance is
demonstrated both visually and in terms of various assessment measures.

of complex objects by collecting hierarchical and different parts of semantic
sub-features. These sub-features can usually be distributed in grouped form in
the feature vector of each layer, representing various semantic entities.
However, the activation of these sub-features is often spatially affected by
similar patterns and noisy backgrounds, resulting in erroneous localization and
identification. We propose a Spatial Group-wise Enhance (SGE) module that can
adjust the importance of each sub-feature by generating an attention factor for
each spatial location in each semantic group, so that every individual group
can autonomously enhance its learnt expression and suppress possible noise. The
attention factors are only guided by the similarities between the global and
local feature descriptors inside each group, thus the design of SGE module is
extremely lightweight with \emph{almost no extra parameters and calculations}.
Despite being trained with only category supervisions, the SGE component is
extremely effective in highlighting multiple active areas with various
high-order semantics (such as the dog's eyes, nose, etc.). When integrated with
popular CNN backbones, SGE can significantly boost the performance of image
recognition tasks. Specifically, based on ResNet50 backbones, SGE achieves

crashes, even if a bubble exists in a short time. In addition, we discover that
the short-term LPPLS confidence indicator highly sensitive to the extreme
fluctuations of Bitcoin price can provide some useful insights into the bubble
status on a shorter time scale - on a day to week scale, and the long-term
LPPLS confidence indicator has a stable performance in terms of effectively
monitoring the bubble status on a longer time scale - on a week to month scale.
The adaptive multilevel time series detection methodology can provide real-time
detection of bubbles and advanced forecast of crashes to warn of the imminent
risk.

of interest has been constructed based on the data of the BU-FCRAO GRS in
$^{13}$CO $J=1\rightarrow0$ emission line, while the collimated emission was
assumed to be aligned with the direction of the relativistic jets, which are
continuously launched by the system. We consider all the available $Chandra$
observations covering the regions possibly containing the reflection signal and
put constraints on the apparent face-on luminosity of SS 433 above 4 keV. No
signatures of the predicted signal have been found in the analysed regions down
to a 4-8 keV surface brightness level of $\sim 10^{-11}$ erg/s/cm$^2$/deg$^2$.
This translates into the limit on the apparent face-on 2-10 keV luminosity of
SS 433 $L_{X,2-10}\lesssim 8\times10^{38}$ erg/s, provided that the considered
clouds do fall inside the illumination cone of the collimated emission. This,
however, might not be the case due to persisting uncertainty in the
line-of-sight distances to SS 433 $d_{SS433}$ (4.5-5.5 kpc) and to the
considered molecular clouds. For half-opening angle of the collimation cone
larger than or comparable to the amplitude of the jets' precession
($\approx21\deg$), the stringent upper limit quoted above is most relevant if
$d_{SS433}<5$ kpc, provided that the kinematic distances to the considered
molecular clouds are sufficiently accurate. Dropping the last assumption, a
more conservative constraint is $L_{X,2-10}\lesssim10^{40}$ erg/s for
$d_{SS433}=4.65-4.85$ kpc (and yet worse outside this range). We conclude that
SS 433 is not likely to belong to the brightest ultraluminous X-ray sources if
it could be observed face-on, unless its X-ray emission is highly collimated.

could benefit from reinforcement learning that has been largely unaddressed.
Emergency evacuation is a complex task which is difficult to solve with
reinforcement learning, since an emergency situation is highly dynamic, with a
lot of changing variables and complex constraints that makes it difficult to
train on. In this paper, we propose the first fire evacuation environment to
train reinforcement learning agents for evacuation planning. The environment is
modelled as a graph capturing the building structure. It consists of realistic
features like fire spread, uncertainty and bottlenecks. We have implemented the
environment in the OpenAI gym format, to facilitate future research. We also
propose a new reinforcement learning approach that entails pretraining the
network weights of a DQN based agents to incorporate information on the
shortest path to the exit. We achieved this by using tabular Q-learning to
learn the shortest path on the building model's graph. This information is
transferred to the network by deliberately overfitting it on the Q-matrix.
Then, the pretrained DQN model is trained on the fire evacuation environment to
generate the optimal evacuation path under time varying conditions. We perform
comparisons of the proposed approach with state-of-the-art reinforcement
learning algorithms like PPO, VPG, SARSA, A2C and ACKTR. The results show that
our method is able to outperform state-of-the-art models by a huge margin
including the original DQN based models. Finally, we test our model on a large
and complex real building consisting of 91 rooms, with the possibility to move
to any other room, hence giving 8281 actions. We use an attention based
mechanism to deal with large action spaces. Our model achieves near optimal
performance on the real world emergency environment.

deep learning inference tasks on resource-constrained platforms. Given a set of
deep neural networks, each pre-trained for a single task, it is desired that
executing arbitrary combinations of tasks yields minimal computation cost.
Pruning each network separately yields suboptimal computation cost due to task
relatedness. A promising remedy is to merge the networks into a multitask
network to eliminate redundancy across tasks before network pruning. However,
pruning a multitask network combined by existing network merging schemes cannot
minimise the computation cost of every task combination because they do not
consider such a future pruning. To this end, we theoretically identify the
conditions such that pruning a multitask network minimises the computation of
all task combinations. On this basis, we propose Pruning-Aware Merging (PAM), a
heuristic network merging scheme to construct a multitask network that
approximates these conditions. The merged network is then ready to be further
pruned by existing network pruning methods. Evaluations with different pruning
schemes, datasets, and network architectures show that PAM achieves up to 4.87x
less computation against the baseline without network merging, and up to 2.01x
less computation against the baseline with a state-of-the-art network merging

recently introduced operational notion of an event, which does allow for
superpositions of respective causal orders in flat spacetime quantum switch

planning is useful to resolve causal dependencies and to break a causally

with the integration of both approaches is that action planning is based on
discrete high-level action- and state spaces, whereas reinforcement learning is
usually driven by a continuous reward function. However, recent advances in
reinforcement learning, specifically, universal value function approximators

on sparse rewards. In this article, we build on these novel methods to
facilitate the integration of action planning with reinforcement learning by
exploiting the reward-sparsity as a bridge between the high-level and low-level

a distribution involving all the classes input data can belong to, while
keeping the data decentralized in each client storage. Our key contribution to
this end is a new decentralized approach for learning GANs from non-iid data

individual discriminator with their own data and b) updates a generator to fool
the most `forgiving' discriminators who deem generated samples as the most

important pattern recognition tasks, but they suffer from high computational
complexity and the lack of interpretability. The recent Tsetlin Machine (TM)
attempts to address this lack by using easy-to-interpret conjunctive clauses in
propositional logic to solve complex pattern recognition problems. The TM
provides competitive accuracy in several benchmarks, while keeping the
important property of interpretability. It further facilitates hardware-near
implementation since inputs, patterns, and outputs are expressed as bits, while
recognition and learning rely on straightforward bit manipulation. In this
paper, we exploit the TM paradigm by introducing the Convolutional Tsetlin
Machine (CTM), as an interpretable alternative to CNNs. Whereas the TM
categorizes an image by employing each clause once to the whole image, the CTM
uses each clause as a convolution filter. That is, a clause is evaluated
multiple times, once per image patch taking part in the convolution. To make
the clauses location-aware, each patch is further augmented with its
coordinates within the image. The output of a convolution clause is obtained
simply by ORing the outcome of evaluating the clause on each patch. In the
learning phase of the TM, clauses that evaluate to 1 are contrasted against the
input. For the CTM, we instead contrast against one of the patches, randomly
selected among the patches that made the clause evaluate to 1. Accordingly, the
standard Type I and Type II feedback of the classic TM can be employed
directly, without further modification. The CTM obtains a peak test accuracy of
99.4% on MNIST, 96.31% on Kuzushiji-MNIST, 91.5% on Fashion-MNIST, and 100.0%
on the 2D Noisy XOR Problem, which is competitive with results reported for

network (RNN) based models have been developed for point processes and have
been found effective. RNN based models usually assume a specific functional
form for the time course of the intensity function of a point process (e.g.,
exponentially decreasing or increasing with the time since the most recent
event). However, such an assumption can restrict the expressive power of the
model. We herein propose a novel RNN based model in which the time course of
the intensity function is represented in a general manner. In our approach, we
first model the integral of the intensity function using a feedforward neural
network and then obtain the intensity function as its derivative. This approach
enables us to both obtain a flexible model of the intensity function and
exactly evaluate the log-likelihood function, which contains the integral of
the intensity function, without any numerical approximations. Our model
achieves competitive or superior performances compared to the previous
state-of-the-art methods for both synthetic and real datasets.

quantum information processing that combines the long coherence times of
solid-state spin qubits with the long-distance connectivity, fast control, and
fast high-fidelity quantum-non-demolition readout of existing superconducting
qubit implementations. Here, we theoretically analyze and optimize the
dispersive readout of a single spin in a semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD)
coupled to a microwave resonator via its electric dipole moment. The strong
spin-photon coupling arises from the motion of the electron spin in a local
magnetic field gradient. We calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the
readout accounting for both Purcell spin relaxation and spin relaxation arising
from intrinsic electric noise within the semiconductor. We express the maximum
achievable SNR in terms of the cooperativity associated with these two
dissipation processes. We find that while the cooperativity increases with the
strength of the dipole coupling between the DQD and the resonator, it does not
depend on the strength of the magnetic field gradient. We then optimize the SNR
as a function of experimentally tunable DQD parameters. We identify wide
regions of parameter space where the unwanted backaction of the resonator
photons on the qubit is small. Moreover, we find that the coupling of the
resonator to other DQD transitions can enhance the SNR by at least a factor of
two, a ``straddling'' effect that occurs only at nonzero energy detuning of the
DQD double-well potential. We estimate that with current technology,
single-shot readout fidelities in the range $82-95\%$ can be achieved within a
few $\mu\textrm{s}$ of readout time without requiring the use of Purcell
filters.

networks, is generally implemented at a remote cloud center for centralized
learning, which is typically time-consuming and resource-hungry. It also incurs
serious privacy issue and long communication latency since a large amount of
data are transmitted to the centralized node. To overcome these shortcomings,
we consider a newly-emerged framework, namely federated edge learning, to
aggregate local learning updates at the network edge in lieu of users' raw
data. Aiming at accelerating the training process, we first define a novel
performance evaluation criterion, called learning efficiency. We then formulate
a training acceleration optimization problem in the CPU scenario, where each
user device is equipped with CPU. The closed-form expressions for joint
batchsize selection and communication resource allocation are developed and
some insightful results are highlighted. Further, we extend our learning
framework to the GPU scenario. The optimal solution in this scenario is
manifested to have the similar structure as that of the CPU scenario,
recommending that our proposed algorithm is applicable in more general systems.
Finally, extensive experiments validate the theoretical analysis and
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the training time and
improve the learning accuracy simultaneously.

the width and depth of the pruned networks, and then transfer parameters from
the unpruned network to pruned networks. To break the structure limitation of
the pruned networks, we propose to apply neural architecture search to search
directly for a network with flexible channel and layer sizes. The number of the
channels/layers is learned by minimizing the loss of the pruned networks. The
feature map of the pruned network is an aggregation of K feature map fragments
(generated by K networks of different sizes), which are sampled based on the
probability distribution.The loss can be back-propagated not only to the
network weights, but also to the parameterized distribution to explicitly tune
the size of the channels/layers. Specifically, we apply channel-wise
interpolation to keep the feature map with different channel sizes aligned in
the aggregation procedure. The maximum probability for the size in each
distribution serves as the width and depth of the pruned network, whose
parameters are learned by knowledge transfer, e.g., knowledge distillation,
from the original networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet
demonstrate the effectiveness of our new perspective of network pruning

approach for mimicking human intelligence, i.e., acquiring new knowledge and
skills with little or even no demonstration. Most of the existing meta-learning
methods are proposed to tackle few-shot learning problems such as image and
text, in rather Euclidean domain. However, there are very few works applying
meta-learning to non-Euclidean domains, and the recently proposed graph neural
networks (GNNs) models do not perform effectively on graph few-shot learning

Meta-GNN -- to tackle the few-shot node classification problem in graph
meta-learning settings. It obtains the prior knowledge of classifiers by
training on many similar few-shot learning tasks and then classifies the nodes
from new classes with only few labeled samples. Additionally, Meta-GNN is a
general model that can be straightforwardly incorporated into any existing

stochastic submodular maximization often assume that items' states are

us to study the stochastic submodular maximization problem with dependent

impersonation credentials, to address the risks of scientific workflows running
on distributed infrastructure including NSF resources (e.g., LIGO Data Grid,

domain in $\R^n$($n\ge 2$). We are interested in finding a special uniform
decay rate of local energy different from the constant coefficient wave
equation.
  More concretely, if the dimensional $n$ is even, whether the uniform decay
rate of local energy for the wave equation with variable coefficients can break
through the limit of polynomial and reach exponential; if the dimensional $n$
is odd, whether the uniform decay rate of local energy for the wave equation
with variable coefficients can hold exponential as the constant coefficient
wave equation .
  \quad \ \ We propose a cone and establish Morawetz's multipliers in a version
of the Riemannian geometry to derive uniform decay of local energy for the wave
equation with variable coefficients. We find that the cone with polynomial
growth is closely related to the uniform decay rate of the local energy. More
concretely, for radial solutions, when the cone has polynomial of degree
$\frac{n}{2k-1}$ growth, the uniform decay rate of local energy is exponential;
when the cone has polynomial of degree $\frac{n}{2k}$ growth, the uniform decay
rate of local energy is polynomial at most. In addition, for general solutions,
when the cone has polynomial of degree $n$ growth, we prove that the uniform
decay rate of local energy is exponential under suitable Riemannian metric. It
is worth pointing out that such results are independent of the parity of the
dimension $n$, which is the main difference with the constant coefficient wave
equation. Finally, for general solutions, when the cone has polynomial of
degree $m$ growth, where $m$ is any positive constant, we prove that the
uniform decay rate of the local energy is of primary polynomial under suitable
Riemannian metric.

intractable to compute. To tackle this issue, we apply a Monte Carlo Markov

influence of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) on the brain morphological

processes into a generative model. A reference morphology is deformed along
specific trajectories to match subject specific morphologies. It is used to
define two imaging progression markers: 1) a morphological age and 2) a disease
score. These markers can be computed locally in any brain region. The approach
is evaluated on brain structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) from the ADNI
database. The generative model is first estimated on a control population,
then, for each subject, the markers are computed for each acquisition. The
longitudinal evolution of these markers is then studied in relation with the
clinical diagnosis of the subjects and used to generate possible morphological
evolution. In the model, the morphological changes associated with normal aging
are mainly found around the ventricles, while the Alzheimer's disease specific
changes are more located in the temporal lobe and the hippocampal area. The
statistical analysis of these markers highlights differences between clinical
conditions even though the inter-subject variability is quiet high. In this
context, the model can be used to generate plausible morphological trajectories
associated with the disease. Our method gives two interpretable scalar imaging
biomarkers assessing the effects of aging and disease on brain morphology at
the individual and population level. These markers confirm an acceleration of
apparent aging for Alzheimer's subjects and can help discriminate clinical
conditions even in prodromal stages. More generally, the joint modeling of
normal and pathological evolutions shows promising results to describe
age-related brain diseases over long time scales.

dependency in hopes of reducing the restrictions of the parametric form of the
intensity function. For the problem of patent citations, we observe that
forecasting a patent's chain of citations benefits from not only the patent's
history itself but also from the historical citations of assignees and
inventors associated with that patent. In this paper, we propose a
sequence-to-sequence model which employs an attention-of-attention mechanism to

the system. NoC simulators are highly relevant for design space exploration

realistic energy consumption of links in NoC simulators is important. This work
presents a simulation environment which implements a technique to precisely
estimate the data dependent link energy consumption in NoCs with virtual
channels for the first time. Our model works at a high level of abstraction,
making it feasible to estimate the energy requirements at an early design
stage. Additionally, it enables the fast evaluation and early exploration of
low-power coding techniques. The presented model is applicable for 2D and 3D
NoCs. A case study for an image processing application shows that the current
link model leads to an underestimate of the link energy consumption by up to a
factor of four. In contrast, the technique presented in this paper estimates
the energy quantities precisely with an error below 1% compared to results
obtained by precise, but computational extensive, bit-level simulation.

new customers choose d queues at random and join the one with the fewest

as compared to simply joining a queue chosen uniformly at random, for load
balancing systems. In this work we perform simulation-based studies to consider
variations where service times for a customer are predicted, as might be done
in modern settings using machine learning techniques or related mechanisms. Our
primary takeaway is that using even seemingly weak predictions of service times
can yield significant benefits over blind First In First Out queueing in this
context. However, some care must be taken when using predicted service time
information to both choose a queue and order elements for service within a
queue; while in many cases using the information for both choosing and ordering
is beneficial, in many of our simulation settings we find that simply using the
number of jobs to choose a queue is better when using predicted service times
to order jobs in a queue. In our simulations, we evaluate both synthetic and
real-world workloads--in the latter, service times are predicted by machine
learning. Our results provide practical guidance for the design of real-world
systems; moreover, we leave many natural theoretical open questions for future
work, validating their relevance to real-world situations.

Although it is well known that modeling the cognitive structure including

existing methods for adaptive learning often separately focus on either
knowledge levels of learners or knowledge structure of learning items. To fully

applying an actor-critic algorithm, CSEAL can sequentially identify the right

recurrent neural network to trace the evolving knowledge levels of learners at
each learning step. Then, we design a navigation algorithm on the knowledge
structure to ensure the logicality of learning paths, which reduces the search
space in the decision process. Finally, the actor-critic algorithm is used to
determine what to learn next and whose parameters are dynamically updated along
the learning path. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of CSEAL.

fuzzy-fuzzy vault scheme. The proposed scheme builds on the classical fuzzy
vault by adding the concept of uncertainty and imprecision to the classical
scheme. To lock a secret key K in the classical fuzzy vault the locking and
unlocking elements are crisp or real elements and consequently the locking and
unlocking operations are strict imperative. In the fuzzy-fuzzy vault scheme,
Alice locks the secret key K using a set of fuzzy elements that belong to
multi-fuzzy set A~ obtained from a universe public set of fuzzy elements in a
multi-fuzzy set F~_q and projecting them on polynomial p. The elements in
multi-fuzzy sets F~_q and A~ are fuzzy using m membership functions MF_i,
i=1,2,...,m. Alice selects a set k of fuzzy elements fuzzy with a specific
membership function MF_K from A~ to lock the vault. To hide the genuine locking
points Alice generates a set of fuzzy chaff points that some of them do not lie
on polynomial p while the other fuzzy chaff points may lie on polynomial p but
fuzzy with different membership functions other than the membership function
MF_K used to lock the vault. To unlock the fuzzy-fuzzy vault and retrieve the
secret key K , Bob should have a set of unlocking fuzzy elements belonging to
multi-fuzzy set B~ which substantially overlap with A~ is required. Then Bob
selects t'_(TF_ki) fuzzy elements from B~ which are close to the t_(TF_k) fuzzy
elements from A~ used by Alice to lock the vault. We show that adding
uncertainty and imprecision by introducing fuzzy theory will enhance the
security threshold of the fuzzy vault.

  Global Coverage",,,"10.1029/2020GL088819",,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A correct quantification of mass and energy exchange processes among land
surface and atmosphere requires an accurate description of unsaturated soil
hydraulic properties. Soil pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have been widely used
to predict soil hydraulic parameters. Here, 13 PTFs were grouped according to
input data requirements and evaluated against a well-documented soil database
with global coverage. Weighted ensembles (calibrated by four groups and the
full 13-member set of PTFs) were shown to have improved performance over
individual PTFs in terms of root mean square error and other model selection
criteria. Global maps of soil water retention data from the ensemble models as
well as their uncertainty were provided. These maps demonstrate that five PTF
ensembles tend to have different estimates, especially in middle and high
latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Our full 13-member ensemble model
provides more accurate estimates than PTFs that are currently being used in
earth system models.

control and enhance energy transfer in ensembles of organic molecules. Here, we
demonstrate that the exciton dynamics in an archetypal purple bacterial
photosynthetic unit, composed of six LH2 antennas surrounding a single LH1
complex, is greatly modified by its interaction with an optical cavity. We
develop a Bloch-Redfield master equation approach that accounts for the
interplay between the B800 and B850 bacteriochlorophyll molecules within each
LH2 antenna, as well as their interactions with the central LH1 complex. Using
a realistic parametrization of both photosynthetic unit and optical cavity, we
investigate the formation of polaritons in the system, revealing that these can
be tuned to accelerate its exciton dynamics by three orders of magnitude. This
yields a significant occupation of the LH1 complex, the stage immediately prior
to the reaction center, with only a few-femtosecond delay after the initial
excitation of the LH2 B800 pigments. Our theoretical findings unveil
polaritonic phenomena as a promising route for the characterization, tailoring,
and optimization of light-harvesting mechanisms in natural and artificial
photosynthetic processes.

type system. Generics in Java, however, include some features---such as Java
wildcards, $F$-bounded generics, and Java erasure---that have been hard to
analyze and reason about so far, reflecting the fact that the mathematical
modeling of generics in Java and other similar nominally-typed object-oriented
programming (OOP) languages is a challenge. As a result, the type systems of
mainstream nominally-typed OOP languages, which are built based on current
models of generics, are overly complex, which hinders the progress of these
type systems.
  In this paper we present a detailed outline of a new approach to modeling
Java generics that uses concepts and tools from order theory, and we report on
our progress in developing this approach. Fundamentally, we use the nominal
subclassing relation (as a partial order) together with some standard and novel
order-theoretic tools to construct the generic nominal subtyping relation (as a
partial order) and the containment relation between generic type arguments (a
third partial order). We further analyze the relation between these three
ordering relations---which lie at the heart of mainstream generic OO type
systems---using order theoretic tools, and accordingly we explore extensions of
OO type systems suggested by such analysis. In our approach we also make use of
some concepts and tools from category theory. We believe a combined
order-theoretic and category-theoretic approach to modeling generics holds the
keys to overcoming much of the adversity found when analyzing features of
generic OO type systems.

considerations. The problem of optimizing an artificial neural network is
treated as a physical system, composed of a conservative vector force field.
The derived scalar potential is a measure of the potential energy of the
network, a function of the distance between predictions and targets.
  Starting from some analogies with wave mechanics, the description of the
system is justified with an eigenvalue equation that is a variant of the
Schr\~odinger equation, in which the potential is defined by the mutual
information between inputs and targets. The weights and parameters of the
network, as well as those of the state function, are varied so as to minimize
energy, using an equivalent of the variational theorem of wave mechanics. The
minimum energy thus obtained implies the principle of minimum mutual
information (MinMI). We also propose a definition of the potential work
produced by the force field to bring a network from an arbitrary probability
distribution to the potential-constrained system, which allows to establish a
measure of the complexity of the system. At the end of the discussion we expose
a recursive procedure that allows to refine the state function and bypass some
initial assumptions, as well as a discussion of some topics in quantum
mechanics applied to the formalism, such as the uncertainty principle and the
temporal evolution of the system.
  Results demonstrate how the minimization of energy effectively leads to a
decrease in the average error between network predictions and targets.
