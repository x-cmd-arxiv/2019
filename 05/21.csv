new observations while preserving robustness. We propose a URBE-based

experiments show that the derived URBE-based strategy leads to a better
trade-off between less conservative solutions and robustness in the presence of
model misspecification. In addition, we show that the DQN-URBE algorithm can
adapt significantly faster to changing dynamics online compared to existing
robust techniques with fixed uncertainty sets.

population of composite particles (clusters) subject to pairwise exchange
interactions. Exchange in this context means that upon interaction of two
clusters, one loses a constituent unit (monomer) and the other gains this unit.
Two variants of the exchange-driven growth model appear in applications. They
differ in whether clusters of zero size are considered active or passive. In
the active case, clusters of size zero can acquire a monomer from clusters of
positive size. In the passive case they cannot, meaning that clusters reaching
size zero are effectively removed from the system. The large time behaviour is
very different for the two variants of the model. We first consider an isolated
system. In the passive case, the cluster size distribution tends towards a
self-similar evolution and the typical cluster size grows as a power of time.
In the active case, we identify a broad class of kernels for which the the
cluster size distribution tends to a non-trivial time-independent equilibrium
in which the typical cluster size is finite. We next consider a non-isolated
system in which monomers are input at a constant rate. In the passive case, the
cluster size distribution again attains a self-similar profile in which the
typical cluster size grows as a power of time. In the active case, a surprising
new behavior is found: the cluster size distribution asymptotes to the same
equilibrium profile found in the isolated case but with an amplitude that grows
linearly in time.

quadratic in the number of deletions and the number of traces. The proposed

Broad wings extending to velocities of 2500 km/s are seen in the [OIII]
emission line profiles of our reddened quasars, suggesting that strong outflows
are affecting the ionised gas kinematics. However, we find no significant
difference between the kinematics of the [OIII] emission in reddened and
unobscured quasars when the two samples are matched in luminosity and redshift.
Our results are consistent with a model where quasar-driven outflows persist
for some time after the obscuring dust has been cleared from along the line of
sight. Assuming the amount of ionised gas in obscured and unobscured quasars is
similar, we use the equivalent width distribution of the [OIII] emission to
constrain the location of the obscuring dust in our reddened quasars. We find
that the dust is most likely to be located on galactic scales, outside the

memorable passwords are often easy to guess. SPARse Two-dimensional
AuthenticatioN (SPARTAN) allows users to input their textual passwords in a

relatively short passwords to have a higher calculated level of security due to
the need for an attacker to determine both the text of the password and the
location of each character in the grid. We created a SPARTAN prototype and
conducted a preliminary user study to evaluate the actual usability and
security of the SPARTAN interface compared to the linear password entry
interface. We find that while user-created SPARTAN passwords tend to be shorter
than their linear counterparts, the calculated security of user-created SPARTAN
passwords is higher than that of user-created linear passwords. We also asked
participants to complete a survey on the usability of the SPARTAN interface and
identified some areas of improvement, while prototype interaction provided
evidence of users becoming more familiar with SPARTAN over time. Finally, we
performed an investigation into password-cracking tools, and assert that
SPARTAN passwords require more resources to crack than their linear

linear passwords from a security standpoint. Usability of the interface and
memorability of SPARTAN passwords is an interesting research question and

transient absorber is spatially inhomogeneous and compact, with sizes ~<0.003
pc, based on covering fractions on the quasar continuum source ranging from
~0.45 in strong UV lines to ~0.04 in NaI D. Cloudy photoionization simulations
show that large total column densities log N_H(cm^-2) >~ 23.4 and an intense
radiation field ~<0.4~pc from the quasar are needed to produce the observed
lines in thick zones of both fully-ionised and partially-ionised gas. The

the transient lines identify a clumpy outflow from the broad emission-line

u^{2^*-1}=0$ in $\mathbb R^n$ with $u > 0$. This equation corresponds to the
Euler-Lagrange equation induced by the Sobolev embedding $H^1(\mathbb
R^n)\hookrightarrow L^{2^*}(\mathbb R^n)$, and it is well-known that the
solutions are uniquely characterized and are given by the so-called ``Talenti
bubbles''. In addition, thanks to a fundamental result by Struwe, this
statement is ``stable up to bubbling'': if $u:\mathbb R^n\to(0,\infty)$ almost
solves $\Delta u + u^{2^*-1}=0$ then $u$ is (nonquantitatively) close in the
$H^1(\mathbb R^n)$-norm to a sum of weakly-interacting Talenti bubbles. More
precisely, if $\delta(u)$ denotes the $H^1(\mathbb R^n)$-distance of $u$ from
the manifold of sums of Talenti bubbles, Struwe proved that $\delta(u)\to 0$ as
$\lVert\Delta u + u^{2^*-1}\rVert_{H^{-1}}\to 0$.
  In this paper we investigate the validity of a sharp quantitative version of
the stability for critical points: more precisely, we ask whether under a bound
on the energy $\lVert\nabla u\rVert_{L^2}$ (that controls the number of
bubbles) it holds $\delta(u) \lesssim \lVert\Delta u +
u^{2^*-1}\rVert_{H^{-1}}$.
  A recent paper by the first author together with Ciraolo and Maggi shows that
the above result is true if $u$ is close to only one bubble. Here we prove, to
our surprise, that whenever there are at least two bubbles then the estimate
above is true for $3\le n\le 5$ while it is false for $n\ge 6$. To our
knowledge, this is the first situation where quantitative stability estimates
depend so strikingly on the dimension of the space, changing completely
behavior for some particular value of the dimension $n$.

performs a schema linking over a question and a database schema. Then, IRNet
adopts a grammar-based neural model to synthesize a SemQL query which is an

deterministically infers a SQL query from the synthesized SemQL query with
domain knowledge. On the challenging Text-to-SQL benchmark Spider, IRNet

$P_m\sim1.5- 2$ GPa has previously been interpreted as evidence for possible
emergence of spin liquid states in this hyperhoneycomb iridate, raising
prospects for experimental realizations of the Kitaev model. Based on
structural data obtained at \emph{room temperature}, this magnetic transition
is believed to originate in small lattice perturbations that preserve crystal
symmetry, and related changes in bond-directional anisotropic exchange
interactions. Here we report on the evolution of the crystal structure of
$\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ under pressure at low temperatures ($T\leq50$ K) and show
that the suppression of magnetism coincides with a change in lattice symmetry
involving Ir-Ir dimerization. The critical pressure for dimerization shifts
from 4.4(2) GPa at room temperature to $\sim1.5-2$ GPa below 50 K. While a
direct $Fddd \rightarrow C2/c$ transition is observed at room temperature, the
low temperature transitions involve new as well as coexisting dimerized phases.
Further investigation of the Ir ($L_3$/$L_2$) isotropic branching ratio in
x-ray absorption spectra indicates that the previously reported departure of
the electronic ground state from a $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ state is closely related
to the onset of dimerized phases. In essence, our results suggest that the
predominant mechanism driving the collapse of magnetism in
$\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ is the pressure-induced formation of Ir$_2$ dimers in the
hyperhoneycomb network. The results further confirm the instability of the
$J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ moments and related non-collinear spiral magnetic ordering
against formation of dimers in the low-temperature phase of compressed

50K, a temperature sizably higher than the one of the LRR peaks. The LRR peaks
have a field and temperature dependence different from those previously
reported for all Molecular Nanomagnets. They do not follow the
Bloembergen-Purcell-Pound scaling of the amplitude and position in temperature

correlation time $\tau$c determined by the spin slowing down at low
temperature. Further, for T lower than 50K the spectral width does not follow
the temperature behavior of the magnetic susceptibility chi. We suggest, using
simple qualitative considerations, that the observed behavior is due to a
combination of two different relaxation processes characterized by the

CO ice (H$_2$CO:CO) irradiated in the Vacuum UltraViolet (VUV) range

gas phase, but also fragments, such as CO and H$_2$. Energy-resolved
photodesorption spectra, coupled with InfraRed (IR) and Temperature Programmed

photodissociation and allowed to discuss photodesorption mechanisms. For the
release of H$_2$CO in the gas phase, they include Desorption Induced by

  We found that H$_2$CO photodesorbs with an average efficiency of $\sim 4-10

considering various methods of calibrating and analyzing such a model given a
few well-resolved simulations. After presenting results for various point

potential of hierarchical Bayesian analysis to uncover previously unanticipated
physical dependencies in the approximate model, and (b) how such insights can

increased computational cost associated with the procedure, we demonstrate the
use of a neural network based surrogate in accelerating the posterior sampling

perform on-the-fly radiative transfer of the interstellar radiation field
(ISRF). The simulation outputs are post-processed to compute the emission of
far infrared lines ([CII], [NII], and [OIII]). At $z=8$, the most massive
galaxy, `Freesia', has an age $t_\star \simeq 409\,{\rm Myr}$, stellar mass
$M_{\star} \simeq 4.2\times 10^9 {\rm M}_{\odot}$, and a star formation rate
${\rm SFR} \simeq 11.5\,{\rm M}_{\odot}{\rm yr}^{-1}$, due to a recent burst.
Freesia has two stellar components (A and B) separated by $\simeq 2.5\, {\rm
kpc}$; other 11 galaxies are found within $56.9 \pm 21.6 \, {\rm kpc}$. The
mean ISRF in the Habing band is $G = 7.9\, G_0$ and is spatially uniform; in
contrast, the ionisation parameter is $U = 2^{+20}_{-2} \times 10^{-3}$, and
has a patchy distribution peaked at the location of star-forming sites. The
resulting ionising escape fraction from Freesia is $f_{\rm esc}\simeq 2\%$.
While [CII] emission is extended (radius 1.54 kpc), [OIII] is concentrated in
Freesia-A (0.85 kpc), where the ratio $\Sigma_{\rm [OIII]}/\Sigma_{\rm [CII]}

relation. We show that this is the general consequence of a starburst phase
(pushing the galaxy above the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation) which
disrupts/photodissociates the emitting molecular clouds around star-forming
sites. Metallicity has a sub-dominant impact on the amplitude of [CII]-SFR

lies slightly inside the event horizon, at an infalling time approximately the
scrambling time $\beta/2\pi \log S_{BH}$ into the past. We can immediately
derive the Page curve, using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, and the
Hayden-Preskill decoding criterion, using entanglement wedge reconstruction.
Because part of the interior is now encoded in the early Hawking radiation, the
decreasing entanglement entropy of the black hole is exactly consistent with
the semiclassical bulk entanglement of the late-time Hawking modes, despite the
absence of a firewall.
  By studying the entanglement wedge of highly mixed states, we can understand
the state dependence of the interior reconstructions. A crucial role is played
by the existence of tiny, non-perturbative errors in entanglement wedge
reconstruction. Directly after the Page time, interior operators can only be
reconstructed from the Hawking radiation if the initial state of the black hole
is known. As the black hole continues to evaporate, reconstructions become
possible that simultaneously work for a large class of initial states. Using
similar techniques, we generalise Hayden-Preskill to show how the amount of
Hawking radiation required to reconstruct a large diary, thrown into the black
hole, depends on both the energy and the entropy of the diary. Finally we argue
that, before the evaporation begins, a single, state-independent interior
reconstruction exists for any code space of microstates with entropy strictly
less than the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and show that this is sufficient
state dependence to avoid the AMPSS typical-state firewall paradox.

planet, as a result of the complex propagation and dissipation of the multiple
spiral density waves it excites in the disk. Numerical efforts to verify this
idea have largely utilized the so-called locally isothermal approximation with
a prescribed disk temperature profile. However, in protoplanetary disks this
approximation does not provide an accurate description of the density wave
dynamics on scales of tens of au. Moreover, we show that locally isothermal
simulations tend to overestimate the contrast of ring and gap features, as well
as misrepresent their positions, when compared to simulations in which the
energy equation is evolved explicitly. This outcome is caused by the
non-conservation of the angular momentum flux of linear perturbations in
locally isothermal disks. We demonstrate this effect using simulations of
locally isothermal and adiabatic disks (with essentially identical temperature
profiles) and show how the dust distributions, probed by mm wavelength
observations, differ between the two cases. Locally isothermal simulations may
thus underestimate the masses of planets responsible for the formation of
multiple gaps and rings on scales of tens of au observed by ALMA. We suggest
that caution should be exercised in using the locally isothermal simulations to

Swiss telescope, 13 years of data from the SMARTS 1.3m telescope at Las
Campanas Observatory and a single year of high-cadence and high-precision
monitoring at the MPIA 2.2m telescope. The time delays measured from these
different data sets, all taken in the R-band, are in good agreement with each
other and with previous measurements from the literature. Combining all the
time-delay estimates from our data sets results in Dt_AB = 36.2-0.8+0.7 days
(2.1% precision), Dt_AC = -23.3-1.4+1.2 days (5.6%) and Dt_BC = -59.4-1.3+1.3

be resolved in the MPIA 2.2m data. We measure a time delay consistent with zero
in this pair of images. We also explore the prior distributions of microlensing
time-delay potentially affecting the cosmological time-delay measurements of

microlensing time delay is neither present nor absent. This work is part of a

apply the Fisher information matrix formalism and spherical harmonic analysis

transforms as a covariant bi-scalar. Therefore, we should be able to discover
the thermality of the Rindler horizon, just by probing the structure of the
propagator, expressed in the Rindler coordinates. I show that the thermal
nature of the Rindler horizon is indeed contained --- though hidden --- in the
standard, inertial, Feynman propagator. The probability $P(E)$ for a particle
to propagate between two events, with energy $E$, can be related to the
temporal Fourier transform of the propagator. A strikingly simple computation
reveals that: (i) $P(E)$ is equal to $P(-E)$ if the propagation is between two
events in the same Rindler wedge while (ii) they are related by a Boltzmann
factor with temperature $T=g/2\pi$, if the two events are separated by a
horizon. A more detailed computation reveals that the propagator itself can be
expressed as a sum of two terms, governing absorption and emission, weighted
correctly by the factors $(1+n_\nu)$ and $n_\nu$ where $n_\nu$ is a Planck
distribution at the temperature $T=g/2\pi$. In fact, one can discover the
Rindler vacuum and the alternative (Rindler) quantization, just by probing the
structure of the inertial propagator. These results can be extended to local
Rindler horizons around any event in a curved spacetime. The implications are

to play a crucial role in the heating of the solar corona. Models that describe
the chromosphere (and the lower transition region), accounting for its highly
dynamic and structured character are, so far, found to be lacking. This is
partly due to the breakdown of complete frequency redistribution in the
chromospheric layers and also because of the difficulty in obtaining complete
sets of observations that adequately constrain the solar atmosphere at all
relevant heights. Aims. We aim to obtain semi-empirical model atmospheres that
reproduce the features of the Mg II h&k line profiles that sample the middle
chromosphere with focus on a sunspot. Methods. We use spectropolarimetric
observations of the Ca II 8542 A spectra obtained with the Swedish 1-m Solar
Telescope (SST) and use NICOLE inversions to obtain semi-empirical model
atmospheres for different features in and around a sunspot. These are used to
synthesize Mg II h&k spectra using RH1.5D code, which we compare with
observations taken with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS).
Results. Comparison of the synthetic profiles with IRIS observations reveals
that there are several areas, especially in the penumbra of the sunspot, where
most of the observed Mg II h&k profiles are very well reproduced. In addition,
we find that supersonic hot downflows, present in our collection of models in
the umbra, lead to synthetic profiles that agree well with the IRIS Mg II h&k
profiles, with the exception of the line core. Conclusions. We put forward and
make available four semi-empirical model atmospheres. Two for the penumbra,
reflecting the range of temperatures obtained for the chromosphere, one for
umbral flashes, and a model representative of the quiet surroundings of a
sunspot. These are available in electronic as well as in table formats.

systems. It is increasingly studied for its relationship to
quantum-over-classical advantages in informatic tasks. To date, it has largely
been studied in discrete-variable scenarios, where observables take values in
discrete and usually finite sets. Practically, on the other hand,
continuous-variable scenarios offer some of the most promising candidates for
implementing quantum computations and informatic protocols. Here we set out a
framework for treating contextuality in continuous-variable scenarios. It is
shown that the Fine--Abramsky--Brandenburger theorem extends to this setting,
an important consequence of which is that Bell nonlocality can be viewed as a
special case of contextuality, as in the discrete case. The contextual
fraction, a quantifiable measure of contextuality that bears a precise
relationship to Bell inequality violations and quantum advantages, is also
defined in this setting. It is shown to be a non-increasing monotone with
respect to classical operations that include binning to discretise data.
Finally, we consider how the contextual fraction can be formulated as an
infinite linear program. Through Lasserre relaxations, we are able to express
this infinite linear program as a hierarchy of semi-definite programs that
allow to calculate the contextual fraction with increasing accuracy.

asymptotic expansion of the partially smoothed conditional min-entropy in the

reveals that the second-order term is not uniform across states, since for
other classes of states the second-order term for partially and globally
smoothed quantities coincides. By relating the task of quantum compression to
that of quantum state merging, our derived expansion allows us to determine the
second-order asymptotic expansion of the optimal rate of quantum data
compression. This closes a gap in the bounds determined by Datta and Leditzky

major site of r-process nucleosynthesis. On the other hand, recent studies
reveal that local chemistry is strongly coupled with the dynamics of Galactic
disk, which predicts that stars radially move on the disk where the observed
elemental feature is different at various Galactocentric distances. Here, we
show that radial migration of stars across the Galactic disk plays a crucial
role in shaping the r-process abundance feature in the solar vicinity. In this
proposed scenario, we highlight the importance of migration from the outer disk
where [r-process/Fe] of some old stars is predicted to be enhanced to the level
beyond the expectation from the observed Galactic Fe and Eu radial gradient,
which results in a large span of [r-process/Fe] among nearby disk stars. The
variation in the [r-process/Fe] ratio seen across the Galactic disk as well as
in dwarf galaxies may be an outcome of different stellar initial mass functions
which change the occurrence frequency between supernovae leaving behind neutron
stars and ones ending with black holes. Here we propose that enhancement in
[Eu/Fe] is attributed to the initial mass function lacking high-mass stars such
as > 25 solar masses in the scheme for which neutron star mergers are a major
source of r-process elements.

magnetization has both staggered in-plane components and non-staggered
out-of-plane components, and can exhibit Rashba-like or Dresselhaus-like
symmetries, depending on the magnetic configuration. Furthermore, there is an
induced local magnetization on the nonmagnetic atoms as well, that is smaller

to search for evidence of physics beyond that explained by current theories.
The observation of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider completed the
set of particles predicted by the Standard Model (SM), currently the best
description of fundamental particles and forces. However, the theory's
limitations include a failure to predict fundamental parameters and the
inability to account for dark matter/energy, gravity, and the matter-antimater
asymmetry in the universe, among other phenomena. Given the lack of additional
particles found so far through direct searches in the post-Higgs era, indirect
searches utilizing precise measurements of well predicted SM observables allow
highly targeted alternative tests for physics beyond the SM. Indirect searches
have the potential to reach mass/energy scales beyond those directly accessible
by today's high-energy accelerators. The value of the weak charge of the proton
Q_W^p is an example of such an indirect search, as it sets the strength of the
proton's interaction with particles via the well-predicted neutral electroweak
force. Parity violation (invariance under spatial inversion (x,y,z) ->
(-x,-y,-z)) is violated only in the weak interaction, thus providing a unique
tool to isolate the weak interaction in order to measure the proton's weak
charge. Here we report Q_W^p=0.0719+-0.0045, as extracted from our measured
parity-violating (PV) polarized electron-proton scattering asymmetry,
A_ep=-226.5+-9.3 ppb. Our value of Q_W^p is in excellent agreement with the SM,

factor and the Lorentz factor of the emitting electrons as well as some of the
microphysical parameters. We find that the sub-TeV emission is an Inverse
Compton radiation produced at the early afterglow stage. Combining the sub-TeV
and X-ray observations we narrow uncertainties in the conditions inside the
emitting zone, almost eliminating them for some parameters. Seventy seconds
after the trigger the forward shock had Lorentz factor $\simeq 100$ and the
electrons producing the observed sub-TeV radiation had a Lorentz factor $\simeq
10^4$, so that the sub-TeV radiation originates from Comptonization of X-ray
photons at the border between Thomson and Klein-Nishina regimes. The inferred
conditions within the emitting zone are at odds with theoretical expectations
unless one assumes moderate (with $\tau \simeq 2$) absorption of sub-TeV
photons inside the source. With this correction the conditions are in good
agreement with predictions of the pair-balance model, but are also acceptable
for generic afterglow model as one of many possibilities. However, the temporal
evolution of the Inverse Compton peak energyis very different in these two
models. This opens a way to discriminate between the models once late-time

analysis focuses on long horizon MDPs with sparse rewards. We show that
selecting the discount factor under which zero Blackwell regret can be achieved
becomes arbitrarily hard. Moreover, even with oracle knowledge of such a
discount factor that can realize a Blackwell regret-free value function, an
$\epsilon$-Blackwell optimal value function may not even be gain optimal.
Difficulties associated with this class of problems is discussed, and the

the computation load while capturing most of the energy in a large number of
important cases. The model accounts for diffuse scattering as it contributes
significantly to the received power. Finally, since the clusters are spatially
well-separated due to the sparsity of first-order reflectors, we generalize the
intra-cluster model to the mmWave channel model via replication. Since narrow
beamwidth increases the number of single-order clusters, we show that the
proposed model suits well to MIMO and massive MIMO applications. We illustrate
that the model gives matching results with published measurements made in a
classroom at 60 GHz. For this specific implementation, while the maximum
cluster angle of arrival (AoA) error is 1 degree, mean angle spread error is 9
degrees. The RMS error for the cluster peak power is found to be 2.2 dB.

(possibly) revising the labels offered by prior analysis. Surveying is a
time-consuming task and effective surveyors must carefully manage their time.
Specifically, they must balance the cost of further surveying against the
additional benefits of that extra effort. This paper proposes SURVEY0, an
incremental Logistic Regression estimation method that implements cost/benefit
analysis. Some classifier is used to rank the as-yet-unvisited examples
according to how interesting they might be. Humans then review the most
interesting examples, after which their feedback is used to update an estimator
for estimating how many examples are remaining. This paper evaluates SURVEY0 in
the context of self-admitted technical debt. As software project mature, they
can accumulate ""technical debt"" i.e. developer decisions which are sub-optimal
and decrease the overall quality of the code. Such decisions are often
commented on by programmers in the code; i.e. it is self-admitted technical
debt (SATD). Recent results show that text classifiers can automatically detect
such debt. We find that we can significantly outperform prior results by
SURVEYing the data. Specifically, for ten open-source JAVA projects, we can
find 83% of the technical debt via SURVEY0 using just 16% of the comments (and
if higher levels of recall are required, SURVEY0can adjust towards that with
some additional effort).

We use Hermite splines to interpolate pressure and its derivatives
simultaneously, thereby preserving mathematical relations between the
derivatives. The method therefore guarantees that thermodynamic identities are
obeyed even between mesh points. In addition, our method enables an estimation
of the precision of the interpolation by comparing the Hermite-spline results
with those of frequent cubic (B-) spline interpolation.
  Methods. We have interpolated pressure as a function of temperature and
density with quintic Hermite 2D-splines. The Hermite interpolation requires
knowledge of pressure and its first and second derivatives at every mesh point.
To obtain the partial derivatives at the mesh points, we used tabulated values
if given or else thermodynamic equalities, or, if not available, values
obtained by differentiating B-splines.
  Results. The results were obtained with the grid of the SAHA-S
equation-of-state (EOS) tables. The maximum $lg P$ difference lies in the range
from $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-4}$, and $\Gamma_1$ difference varies from $10^{-9}$ to
$10^{-3}$. Specifically, for the points of a solar model, the maximum
differences are one order of magnitude smaller than the aforementioned values.
The poorest precision is found in the dissociation and ionization regions,
occurring at $T \sim 1.5\cdot 10^3 - 10^5$ K. The best precision is achieved at
higher temperatures, $T>10^5$ K. To discuss the significance of the
interpolation errors we compare them with the corresponding difference between
two different equation-of-state formalisms, SAHA-S and OPAL 2005. We find that
the interpolation errors of the pressure are a few orders of magnitude less
than the differences from between the physical formalisms, which is
particularly true for the solar-model points.

we construct an extended effective action in a generalised Schwinger-Keldysh

action and show their dependence on the bath's 4-point OTOCs. We analyse the
constraints imposed on the OTO effective theory by microscopic reversibility

as well as energy and chemical enrichment feedback from asymptotic giant branch
stars, core-collapse supernovae, and Type Ia supernovae. The predicted
relations between the He mass fraction, $Y$, and the metallicity, $Z$, in the
interstellar medium of our simulated disc galaxies depend on the past galaxy
star formation history. In particular, $dY/dZ$ is not constant and evolves as a
function of time, depending on the specific chemical element that we choose to
trace $Z$; in particular, $dY/dX_{\text{O}}$ and $dY/dX_{\text{C}}$ increase as
functions of time, whereas $dY/dX_{\text{N}}$ decreases. In the gas-phase, we
find negative radial gradients of $Y$, due to the inside-out growth of our
simulated galaxy discs as a function of time; this gives rise to longer
chemical enrichment time scales in the outer galaxy regions, where we find
lower average values for $Y$ and $Z$. Finally, by means of chemical evolution
models, in the galactic bulge and inner disc, we predict steeper $Y$ versus age
relations at high $Z$ than in the outer galaxy regions. We conclude that, for
calibrating the assumed $Y$-$Z$ relation in stellar models, C, N, and C+N are
better proxies for the metallicity than O, because they show steeper and less

spectral synthesis is applied on high resolution spectroscopic data in order to
derive precise astrophysical parameters. Doppler imaging is performed to
recover surface temperature maps for two subsequent intervals.
Cross-correlation of the consecutive Doppler maps is used to derive surface
differential rotation. The rotational modulation of the chromospheric activity
indicators is also investigated. An activity cycle of $\approx 1600$ days is
detected for V1358 Ori. Doppler imaging revealed a surface temperature
distribution dominated by a large polar cap with a few weaker features around
the equator. This spot configuration is similar to other maps of young solar
analogues from the literature, and supports recent model predictions. We
detected solar-like surface differential rotation with a surface shear
parameter of $\alpha = 0.016 \pm 0.010$ which fits pretty well to our recently
proposed empirical relation between rotation and differential rotation. The

  Validation",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Experimental multi-scalar measurements in laboratory flames have provided
important databases for the validation of turbulent combustion closure models.
In this work, we present a framework for data-based closure in turbulent
combustion and establish an a priori validation of this framework. The approach
is based on the construction of joint probability density functions (PDFs) and
conditional statistics using experimental data based on the parameterization of
the composition space using principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA on the
data identifies key parameters, principal components (PCs), on which joint
scalar PDFs and conditional scalar means can be constructed. To enable a
generic implementation for the construction of joint scalar PDFs, we use the
multi-dimensional kernel density estimation (KDE) approach. An a priori
validation of the PCA-KDE approach is carried out using the Sandia piloted jet
turbulent flames D, E and F. The analysis of the results suggests that a few
PCs are adequate to reproduce the statistics, resulting in a low-dimensional
representation of the joint scalars PDFs and the scalars' conditional means. A
reconstruction of the scalars' means and RMS statistics are in agreement with
the corresponding statistics extracted directly from the experimental data. We
also propose one strategy to recover missing species and construct conditional
means for the reaction rates based on a variation of the pairwise-mixing
stirred reactor (PMSR) model. The model is demonstrated using numerical
simulations based on the one-dimensional turbulence (ODT) model for the same
flames.

rise to a multi-marginal optimal transport (MMOT) problem. Here the marginal
state space for our MMOT problem is the binary set $\{0,1\}$, and the number of
marginals is the number $L$ of sites in the model. The costs of storing and
computing the exact solution of the MMOT problem both scale exponentially with
respect to $L$. We propose an efficient convex relaxation which can be solved
by semidefinite programming (SDP). In particular, the semidefinite constraint
is only of size $2L\times 2L$. Moreover, the SDP-based method yields an
approximation of the dual potential needed to the perform self-consistent field
iteration in the so-called Kohn-Sham SCE framework, which, once converged,
yields a lower bound for the total energy of the system. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods on spinless and spinful Hubbard-type models.
Numerical results indicate that our relaxation methods yield tight lower bounds
for the optimal cost, in the sense that the error due to the semidefinite
relaxation is much smaller than the intrinsic modeling error of the Kohn-Sham
SCE method. We also describe how our relaxation methods generalize to arbitrary
MMOT problems with pairwise cost functions.

  The importance of decompilation has motivated the construction of

our approach automatically trains a decompiler that can translate (decompile) T
back to S . We used our framework to decompile both LLVM IR and x86 assembly to

subject to measurement error, as the data are not collected to support research
questions under study. These data errors, if not accounted for in study
analyses, can obscure or cause spurious associations between patient exposures
and disease risk. Methodology to address covariate measurement error has been
well developed; however, time-to-event error has also been shown to cause
significant bias but methods to address it are relatively underdeveloped. More
generally, it is possible to observe errors in both the covariate and the
time-to-event outcome that are correlated. We propose regression calibration
(RC) estimators to simultaneously address correlated error in the covariates
and the censored event time. Although RC can perform well in many settings with
covariate measurement error, it is biased for nonlinear regression models, such
as the Cox model. Thus, we additionally propose raking estimators which are
consistent estimators of the parameter defined by the population estimating
equation. Raking can improve upon RC in certain settings with failure-time
data, require no explicit modeling of the error structure, and can be utilized
under outcome-dependent sampling designs. We discuss features of the underlying
estimation problem that affect the degree of improvement the raking estimator
has over the RC approach. Detailed simulation studies are presented to examine
the performance of the proposed estimators under varying levels of signal,
error, and censoring. The methodology is illustrated on observational EHR data
on HIV outcomes from the Vanderbilt Comprehensive Care Clinic.

by taking the power spectrum of a power spectrum, or with autocorrelation

Facebook, High-Performance Computing, Machine Learning, and simulation
generated traces) and presents a systematic approach to quantify and compare
the structure of packet traces based on the entropy contained in the trace
file. Insights into the structure of packet traces can lead to improved network
algorithms that are optimized toward specific traffic patterns. We then present
a methodology to quantify the temporal and non-temporal components of entropy
contained in a packet trace, called the trace complexity, using randomization
and compression. We show that trace complexity provides unique insights into
the characteristics of various applications and argue that there is a need for
traffic generation models that preserve the intrinsic structure of empirically
measured application traces. We then propose a traffic generator model that is
able to produce a synthetic trace that matches the complexity level of its
corresponding real-world trace.

differences in the resonant frequencies. We then demonstrate that harmonic
resonators of different order are coupled through non-reciprocal admittance
inverters whereas harmonic resonators of the same order couple with the
admittance inverter coming from the unmodulated filter network. This coupling
topology provides useful insights to understand and quickly design
non-reciprocal filters and permits their characterization using an
asynchronously tuned coupled resonators network together with the coupling
matrix formalism. Two designed filters, of orders three and four, are
experimentally demonstrated using quarter wavelength resonators implemented in
microstrip technology and terminated by a varactor on one side. The varactors
are biased using coplanar waveguides integrated in the ground plane of the
device. Measured results are found to be in good agreement with numerical
results, validating the proposed theory.

forcing method (MFM), which reveals the differential operators acting on the
mean fields of quantities transported by underlying fluctuating flows.
Specifically, MFM can precisely determine the eddy diffusivity operator, or
more broadly said, it can reveal differential operators associated with
turbulence closure for scalar and momentum transport. We present this
methodology by considering canonical problems with increasing complexity.
Starting from the well-known problem of dispersion of passive scalars by
parallel flows we elucidate the basic steps in quantitative determination of
the eddy viscosity operators using MFM. Utilizing the operator representation
in Fourier space, we obtain a stand-alone compact analytical operator that can
accurately capture the nonlocal mixing effects. Furthermore, a cost-effective
generalization of MFM for analysis of nonhomogeneous and wall-bounded flows is
developed and is comprehensively discussed through a demonstrative example.
Extension of MFM for analysis of momentum transport is theoretically
constructed through the introduction of a generalized momentum transport
equation. We show that closure operators obtained through MFM analysis of this
equation provide the exact RANS solutions obtained through averaging of the
Navier-Stokes equation. We introduce MFM as an effective tool for quantitative
understanding of non-Boussinesq effects and assessment of model forms in
turbulence closures, particularly, the effects associated with anisotropy and
nonlocality of macroscopic mixing.

deployed in modern processors. This paper shows for the first time in detail
that the LRU states of caches can be used to leak information: any access to a
cache by a sender will modify the LRU state, and the receiver is able to
observe this through a timing measurement. This paper presents LRU timing-based
channels both when the sender and the receiver have shared memory, e.g., shared
library data pages, and when they are separate processes without shared memory.
In addition, the new LRU timing-based channels are demonstrated on both Intel
and AMD processors in scenarios where the sender and the receiver are sharing
the cache in both hyper-threaded setting and time-sliced setting. The
transmission rate of the LRU channels can be up to 600Kbps per cache set in the
hyper-threaded setting. Different from the majority of existing cache channels
which require the sender to trigger cache misses, the new LRU channels work
with the sender only having cache hits, making the channel faster and more
stealthy. This paper also demonstrates that the new LRU channels can be used in
transient execution attacks, e.g., Spectre. Further, this paper shows that the
LRU channels pose threats to existing secure cache designs, and this work
demonstrates the LRU channels affect the secure PL cache. The paper finishes by
discussing and evaluating possible defenses.

multivariate systems from observational data by determining an equivalent class
of causal structures compatible with the conditional independencies in the
data. Methods based on additive-noise (AN) models have been proposed to further
discriminate between causal structures that are equivalent in terms of
conditional independencies. These methods rely on a particular form of the
generative functional equations, with an additive noise structure, which allows
inferring the directionality of causation by testing the independence between
the residuals of a nonlinear regression and the predictors
(nrr-independencies). Full causal structure identifiability has been proven for
systems that contain only additive-noise equations and have no hidden
variables. We extend the AN framework in several ways. We introduce alternative
regression-free tests of independence based on conditional variances
(cv-independencies). We consider conditionally-additive-noise (CAN) models, in
which the equations may have the AN form only after conditioning. We exploit
asymmetries in nrr-independencies or cv-independencies resulting from the CAN
form to derive a criterion that infers the causal relation between a pair of
variables in a multivariate system without any assumption about the form of the
equations or the presence of hidden variables.

need a description whose length grows exponentially with the system size.
However, with some systems it is possible to escape the curse by using low-rank
tensor approximations known as `matrix-product state/operator (MPS/O)

Spatially disordered interaction and environment-induced decoherence drive
systems into non-trivial asymptotic states. The dissipative evolution is
modeled with a Markovian master equation in the Lindblad form. By implementing
the MPO technique and propagating system states with the time-evolving block

deformation of the subduction interface. Although there is microstructural
evidence elucidating the nature of brittle deformation at low pressures, there
is often conflicting evidence regarding the potential for plastic deformation
in the ductile regime at higher pressures. Here, we present a series of
spherical nanoindentation experiments on aggregates of natural antigorite.
These experiments effectively investigate the single-crystal mechanical
behavior because the volume of deformed material is significantly smaller than
the grain size. Individual indents reveal elastic loading followed by yield and
strain hardening. The magnitude of the yield stress is a function of crystal
orientation, with lower values associated with indents parallel to the basal
plane. Unloading paths reveal more strain recovery than expected for purely
elastic unloading. The magnitude of inelastic strain recovery is highest for
indents parallel to the basal plane. We also imposed indents with cyclical
loading paths, and observed strain energy dissipation during unloading-loading
cycles conducted up to a fixed maximum indentation load and depth. The
magnitude of this dissipated strain energy was highest for indents parallel to
the basal plane. Subsequent scanning electron microscopy revealed surface
impressions accommodated by shear cracks and a general lack of lattice
misorientation around indents, indicating the absence of dislocations. Based on
these observations, we suggest that antigorite deformation at high pressures is
dominated by sliding on shear cracks. We develop a microphysical model that is
able to quantitatively explain the Young's modulus and dissipated strain energy
data during cyclic loading experiments, based on either frictional or cohesive
sliding of an array of cracks contained in the basal plane.

this by identifying conditions under which the random-regressions restricted
likelihood is likely to be maximized at a boundary value. Resistance to this
approach seems to arise from a view that it lacks the certainty or intellectual
heft of mathematics, perhaps because simulation experiments in our literature
rarely do more than measure a new method's operating characteristics in a small
range of situations. We argue that such work can make useful contributions
including, as in molecular biology, the findings themselves and sometimes the
designs used in the five steps; that these contributions have as much practical
value as mathematical results; and that therefore they merit publication as
much as the mathematical results our discipline esteems so highly.

require an overly large number of measurement in order to achieve a reasonably

across multiple users in a multi-tenant cluster environment. Computational
resources (i.e., CPU, memory, disk, etc. ) are distributed according to the
Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF) policy. Mesos frameworks (users) receive
resources based on their current usage and are responsible for scheduling their
tasks within the allocation. We have observed that multiple frameworks can
cause fairness imbalance in a multiuser environment. For example, a greedy
framework consuming more than its fair share of resources can deny resource
fairness to others. The user with the least Dominant Share is considered first
by the DRF module to get its resource allocation. However, the default DRF
implementation, in Apache Mesos' Master allocation module, does not consider
the overall resource demands of the tasks in the queue for each user/framework.
This lack of awareness can result in users without any pending task receiving
more resource offers while users with a queue of pending tasks starve due to
their high dominant shares. We have developed a policy-driven queue manager,
Tromino, for an Apache Mesos cluster where tasks for individual frameworks can
be scheduled based on each framework's overall resource demands and current
resource consumption. Dominant Share and demand awareness of Tromino and
scheduling based on these attributes can reduce (1) the impact of unfairness
due to a framework specific configuration, and (2) unfair waiting time due to
higher resource demand in a pending task queue. In the best case, Tromino can
significantly reduce the average waiting time of a framework by using the
proposed Demand-DRF aware policy.

(2) task level scheduling by each framework for the resources allocated during
the previous step. We have conducted experiments in a local Mesos cluster when
used with frameworks such as Apache Aurora, Marathon, and our own framework
Scylla, to study resource fairness and cluster utilization. Experimental

confined into hydrogen-rich layers in the white dwarf. Often observed
modulations in amplitudes and frequencies even during an observing season may
be interpreted as beatings among densely distributed r-mode frequencies. Making
the r-mode frequency distribution of a model to be consistent (by adjusting the
rotation frequency) with the observed pulsation frequencies, we obtain the
best-fit rotation rate for each case. The rotation periods thus obtained for 17
accreting white dwarfs lie between 4 and 10 minutes. Pulsation frequencies
observed sometime after a dwarf-nova outburst tend to be higher than the
pre-outburst values, so that the best-fit rotation rate for the post-outburst
frequencies is also higher. This indicates a spin-up of the hydrogen-rich
layers to occur by an enhanced accretion at the outburst. We also discuss the
relation between the rotation frequencies of pulsating accreting white dwarfs
and the orbital periods.

(MWU) with constant step-size is Lyapunov chaotic in the dual (payoff) space.
Simply put, let's assume that an observer asks the agents playing
Matching-Pennies whether they prefer Heads or Tails (and by how much in terms
of aggregate payoff so far). The range of possible answers consistent with any
arbitrary small set of initial conditions blows up exponentially with time
everywhere in the payoff space. This result is robust both algorithmically as
well as game theoretically:
  1) Algorithmic robustness: Chaos is robust to agents using any of a general
sub-family of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithms, the well known
regret-minimizing dynamics, even when agents mix-and-match dynamics, use
different or slowly decreasing step-sizes.

zero-sum games (strictly competitive games), network variants with arbitrary
large number of agents and even to competitive settings beyond these.

programmers to consider blocks of actions (transactions) as executing in

on availability, modern databases provide weaker consistency models, one of the
most prominent being \emph{snapshot isolation}. In general, the correctness of
a program relying on serializable transactions may be broken when using weaker
models. However, certain programs may also be insensitive to consistency
relaxations, i.e., all their properties holding under serializability are
preserved even when they are executed over a weak consistent database and
without additional synchronization.
  In this paper, we address the issue of verifying if a given program is {\em
robust against snapshot isolation}, i.e., all its behaviors are serializable
even if it is executed over a database ensuring snapshot isolation. We show
that this verification problem is polynomial time reducible to a state
reachability problem in transactional programs over a sequentially consistent

verification technology for reasoning about weakly-consistent programs. In

samples will revolutionize our understanding of the role of metabolites in
biological systems. Existing and emerging technologies have enabled measurement
of chemical properties of molecules in complex mixtures and, in concert, are
sensitive enough to resolve even stereoisomers. Despite these experimental
advances, small molecule identification is inhibited by (i) chemical reference
libraries representing <1% of known molecules, limiting the number of possible
identifications, and (ii) the lack of a method to generate candidate matches
directly from experimental features (i.e. without a library). To this end, we
developed a variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a continuous numerical, or
latent, representation of molecular structure to expand reference libraries for
small molecule identification. We extended the VAE to include a chemical
property decoder, trained as a multitask network, in order to shape the latent
representation such that it assembles according to desired chemical properties.
The approach is unique in its application to small molecule identification,
with its focus on m/z and CCS, paired with its training paradigm, which
involved a cascade of transfer learning iterations. This allows the network to
learn as much as possible at each stage, enabling success with progressively
smaller datasets without overfitting. Once trained, the network can rapidly
predict chemical properties directly from structure, as well as generate
candidate structures with desired chemical properties. Additionally, the
ability to generate novel molecules along manifolds, defined by chemical
property analogues, positions DarkChem as highly useful in a number of
application areas, including metabolomics and small molecule identification,
drug discovery and design, chemical forensics, and beyond.

due to its importance for robot navigation. It is currently experiencing
significant scientific progress due to its relevance in automated warehousing
(such as those operated by Amazon) and in other contemporary application areas.
In this paper, we demonstrate that many recently developed MAPF algorithms
apply more broadly than currently believed in the MAPF research community. In
particular, we describe the 3D Pipe Routing (PR) problem, which aims at placing
collision-free pipes from given start locations to given goal locations in a

MAPF instance is a set of blocked cells in x-y-t space, while a solution to the
corresponding PR instance is a set of blocked cells in x-y-z space. We show how
to use this similarity to apply several recently developed MAPF algorithms to
the PR problem, and discuss their performance on abstract PR instances. We also
discuss further research necessary to tackle real-world pipe-routing instances

improve the generalization capability of the model: 1) the proposed model can
simultaneously capture multi-view and multi-scale features of different nodules
in CT images; 2) we combine the features of the intensity and the convolution
neural networks (CNN). We propose a pooling method, called the central
intensity-pooling layer (CIP), to extract the intensity features of the center
voxel of the block, and then use the CNN to obtain the convolutional features
of the center voxel of the block. In addition, we designed a weighted sampling
strategy based on the boundary of nodules for the selection of those voxels
using the weighting score, to increase the accuracy of the model. The proposed
method has been extensively evaluated on the LIDC dataset containing 986
nodules. Experimental results show that the DB-ResNet achieves superior

Moreover, we compared our results with those of four radiologists on the same

It is important to conduct performance and feature analysis of the container

Docker and Singularity on bare metal nodes in the Chameleon cloud (2) mechanism
by which Docker containers can be mapped with InfiniBand hardware with RDMA

Here we show that the data of $\kappa$ measured in several single crystals are
divided into two groups with and without the residual linear term. In the first
group with finite $\kappa_0/T$, the phonon thermal conductivity $\kappa_{ph}$
is comparable to that of other organic compounds. In these crystals, the phonon
mean free path $\ell_{ph}$ saturates at low temperatures, being limited by
sample size. On the other hand, in the second group with zero $\kappa_0/T$,
$\kappa_{ph}$ is one order of magnitude smaller than that in the first group,
comparable to that of amorphous solids. In contrast to the first group,
$\ell_{ph}$ shows a glassy-like non-saturating behavior at low temperatures.
These results suggest that the crystals with long $\ell_{ph}$ are required to
discuss the magnetic excitations by thermal conductivity measurements.

  Animated by Follower Forces",,,,,"physics.bio-ph physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Elastically driven filaments subjected to animating compressive follower
forces provide a synthetic way to mimic the oscillatory beating of active
biological filaments such as eukaryotic cilia. The dynamics of such active
filaments can, under favorable conditions, exhibit stable time-periodic
responses that result due to the interplay of elastic buckling instabilities,
geometric constraints, boundary conditions, and dissipation due to fluid drag.
In this paper, we use a continuum elastic rod model to estimate the critical
follower force required for the onset of the stable time-periodic flapping
oscillations in pre-stressed rods subjected to fluid drag. The pre-stress is
generated by imposing either clamped-clamped or clamped-pinned boundary
constraints and the results are compared with those of clamped-free case, which
is without pre-stress. We find that the critical value increases with the
initial slack--that quantifies the pre-stress, and strongly depends on the type
of the constraints at the boundaries. The frequency of oscillations far from
the onset, however, depends primarily on the magnitude of the follower force,
not on the boundary constraints. Interestingly, oscillations for the
clamped-pinned case are observed only when the follower forces are directed
towards the clamped end. This finding can be exploited to design a mechanical
switch to initiate or quench the oscillations by reversing the direction of the
follower force or altering the boundary conditions.

in 0{\deg}, 45{\deg} and 90{\deg} directions with respect to the draw direction

solving a large sparse linear system of equations, typically, arising from the
discretization of partial differential equations. One critical step in the
multilevel/multigrid methods is to form coarse matrices through a sequence of
sparse matrix triple products. A commonly used approach for the triple products
explicitly involves two steps, and during each step a sparse matrix-matrix
multiplication is employed. This approach works well for many applications with
a good computational efficiency, but it has a high memory overhead since some
auxiliary matrices need to be temporarily stored for accomplishing the
calculations. In this work, we propose two new algorithms that construct a
coarse matrix with taking one pass through the input matrices without involving
any auxiliary matrices for saving memory. The new approaches are referred to as
""all-at-once"" and ""merged all-at-once"", and the traditional method is denoted
as ""two-step"". The all-at-once and the merged all-at-once algorithms are
implemented based on hash tables in PETSc as part of this work with a careful
consideration on the performance in terms of the compute time and the memory
usage. We numerically show that the proposed algorithms and their
implementations are perfectly scalable in both the compute time and the memory
usage with up to 32,768 processor cores for a model problem with 27 billions of
unknowns. The scalability is also demonstrated for a realistic neutron
transport problem with over 2 billion unknowns on a supercomputer with 10,000
processor cores. Compared with the traditional two-step method, the all-at-once
and the merged all-at-once algorithms consume much less memory for both the
model problem and the realistic neutron transport problem meanwhile they are
able to maintain the computational efficiency.

associated in the first place with rivalry of alternative definitions of
optical momentum of the electromagnetic wave in a medium. Assuming significance
of alternative equations of momentum conservation in accord with their
interconnection, potential functional equivalence of alternative descriptions
of optical momentum is examined in the context of the radiation pressure. In
accordance with conducted examination, the material derivative of the momentum
of a closed medium-field system is preserved in transformations linking
alternative equations of momentum conservation, whereas the optical momentum is
changed in compliance with alternative approaches. It is found that Abraham's,
Minkowski's, and the total momenta are inherently linked with specific
ponderomotive forces, which are not interchangeable in spite of interconnection
of involved forms of field equations and equations of conservation of the
momentum. Interconnection of alternative macroscopic approaches is clarified
using microscopic interpretation of the energy and the momentum of the
electromagnetic wave in a host medium. Contradictory references to microscopic
aspects associated with alternative approaches, including assumptions in regard
to manifestation of the Lorentz force on the level of macroscopic description

of Ramsey's theorem from a computational viewpoint was the relation between
Ramsey's theorem for pairs ($\mathsf{RT}^2_2$) and its restriction to stable

Virial supermassive black hole masses (SMBH, \mbh) are calculated from the $\rm

\propto \varepsilon^{-0.60\pm 0.1}$. It is found that this fraction also has a
correlation with the SMBH mass, $F_x \propto \varepsilon^{-0.74\pm 0.14} M_{\rm

lead to the formation of a hot corona, our result favours the shear stress
tensor being a proportion of the gas pressure. For our entire sample, it is
found that the hard X-ray photon index $\Gamma$ has a weak but significant
correlation with the Eddington ratio, $ \Gamma=2.17+0.21\log \varepsilon$.
However, this correlation is not robust because the relation is not
statistically significant for its subsample of 32 RM AGNs with relatively
reliable $M_{\rm BH}$ or its subsample of 166 AGNs with single-epoch $M_{\rm

  The central objects of interest in noncommutative convexity are
noncommutative convex sets. The category of compact noncommutative sets is dual
to the category of operator systems, and there is a robust notion of extreme
point for a noncommutative convex set that is dual to Arveson's notion of
boundary representation for an operator system.
  We identify the C*-algebra of continuous noncommutative functions on a
compact noncommutative convex set as the maximal C*-algebra of the operator
system of continuous noncommutative affine functions on the set. In the
noncommutative setting, unital completely positive maps on this C*-algebra play
the role of representing measures in the classical setting.
  The continuous convex noncommutative functions determine an order on the set
of unital completely positive maps that is analogous to the classical Choquet
order on probability measures. We characterize this order in terms of the
extensions and dilations of the maps, providing a powerful new perspective on
the structure of completely positive maps on operator systems.

Smoluchowski equation that governs the dynamics of colloidal particle. We
address this as active Smoluchowski equation. Our analysis based on this active
Smoluchowski equation shows a short time superdiffusive behavior that strongly
depends on the activity. Our model also predicts a non-monotonic dependence of
mean energy dissipation against time, a signature of activity-induced dynamics.
By introducing a frequency-dependent effective temperature, we show that the
mean rate of entropy production is time dependent unlike a thermal system. The
prime reason for these anomalies is the absence of any fluctuation-dissipation
theorem for the active noise. We also comment on how microscopic details of

long standing problems in condensed matter physics. An aspect of the
fundamental difficulties lies in the fact that such nonmagnetic disorders lead
effective interactions between abundant soft modes near the Fermi surface to be
drastically enhanced particularly in the diffusive regime, where the
perturbative framework does not work. Here, we revisit the problem of dirty
quantum critical metals in a different angle, focusing on the hydrodynamic
regime instead of the diffusive regime near the non-Fermi liquid quantum
critical point. More concretely, we study effects of mutual correlations
between quantum critical nematic fluctuations and weak localization
corrections, and show the existence of a weak-disorder non-Fermi liquid fixed
point, based on the renormalization group (RG) analysis up to the two-loop
order. The two-loop order RG analysis suggests that the absence of quantum
coherence in two-particle composite excitations weakens the role of weak
localization corrections and allows a weakly disordered non-Fermi liquid
metallic state in the hydrodynamic regime of the nematic quantum critical
point. Although this dirty non-Fermi liquid metallic state may not be the true
infrared stable fixed point at zero temperature, expected to be characterized
by the diffusive Ohmic regime, we argue that this weak-disorder non-Fermi
liquid metallic fixed point would govern the region of an intermediate energy
scale, described by effective hydrodynamics of nematic quantum criticality. In
this respect we believe that this research would be an important step in
understanding the $T-$linear electrical resistivity as a characteristic feature
of non-Fermi liquids and the origin of unconventional superconductivity from
effective hydrodynamics of quantum criticality.

to our analysis for achieving the above goals is an error bound in terms of

we derive the limiting distributions of self-normalized test statistics under

problems in algorithmic statistics. While each of these properties have been
studied extensively and separate optimal estimators are known for each, in
striking recent work, Acharya et al. 2016 showed that there is a single
estimator that is competitive for all symmetric properties. This work proved
that computing the distribution that approximately maximizes \emph{profile
likelihood (PML)}, i.e. the probability of observed frequency of frequencies,
and returning the value of the property on this distribution is sample
competitive with respect to a broad class of estimators of symmetric
properties. Further, they showed that even computing an approximation of the
PML suffices to achieve such a universal plug-in estimator. Unfortunately,
prior to this work there was no known polynomial time algorithm to compute an
approximate PML and it was open to obtain a polynomial time universal plug-in
estimator through the use of approximate PML. In this paper we provide a
algorithm (in number of samples) that, given $n$ samples from a distribution,
computes an approximate PML distribution up to a multiplicative error of
$\exp(n^{2/3} \mathrm{poly} \log(n))$ in time nearly linear in $n$.
Generalizing work of Acharya et al. 2016 on the utility of approximate PML we
show that our algorithm provides a nearly linear time universal plug-in
estimator for all symmetric functions up to accuracy $\epsilon =
\Omega(n^{-0.166})$. Further, we show how to extend our work to provide

dispersion and momentum conservation allow the spoof surface plasmon polaritons
(SSP) structure to become a sensitive probe for spatial harmonics. This enables
that the spatial information of the targets including both propagating and
evanescent components, can be extracted by tuning and recording SSP in the far

Fourier transform of the sampled spatial spectrum. Using the modified
subwavelength metallic grating as the spoof plasmonic structure, a far-field
resolution of 0.17 wavelength is numerically and experimentally verified, and
two-dimensional imaging ability is also fully discussed. The imaging ability
and flexibility can be further optimizing the SSP structures. We are confident
that our working mechanism will have great potentials in the superresolution

chance imbalances. It may be possible to improve the precision of the treatment
effect estimate by adjusting for these imbalances. Building on related work for
completely randomized experiments, we propose the P-LOOP (paired leave-one-out
potential outcomes) estimator for paired experiments. We leave out each pair
and then impute its potential outcomes using any prediction algorithm. The
imputation method is flexible; for example, we could use lasso or random
forests. While similar methods exist for completely randomized experiments,
covariate adjustment methods in paired experiments are relatively understudied.
A unique trade-off exists for paired experiments, where it can be unclear
whether to factor in pair assignments when making adjustments. We address this
issue in the P-LOOP estimator by automatically deciding whether to account for
the pairing when imputing the potential outcomes. By addressing this trade-off,
the method has the potential to improve precision over existing methods.

applications, it has two notable challenges. First, it is assumed that the
resulting regions are both homogeneous and spatially contiguous. Second, it is
well-recognized that landscapes are hierarchical such that fine-scale regions
are nested wholly within broader-scale regions. To address these two
challenges, first, we develop a spatially constrained spectral clustering
framework for region delineation that incorporates the tradeoff between region
homogeneity and spatial contiguity. The framework uses a flexible, truncated
exponential kernel to represent the spatial contiguity constraints, which is
integrated with the landscape feature similarity matrix for region delineation.
To address the second challenge, we extend the framework to create fine-scale
regions that are nested within broader-scaled regions using a greedy, recursive
bisection approach. We present a case study of a terrestrial ecology data set
in the United States that compares the proposed framework with several baseline
methods for regionalization. Experimental results suggest that the proposed
framework for regionalization outperforms the baseline methods, especially in
terms of balancing region contiguity and homogeneity, as well as creating
regions of more similar size, which is often a desired trait of regions.

particularly in enhancing the attainment of driving safety. However, to our
knowledge, no clear guideline exists so far regarding safety-aware AV computing

autonomous driving fleets in various locations, road conditions, and traffic

performance metrics, such as tail latency, average latency, maximum latency,
and timeout, cannot fully satisfy the safety requirement for AV computing
system design. To address this issue, we propose a `safety score' as a primary
metric for measuring the level of safety in AV computing system design.
Furthermore, we propose a perception latency model, which helps architects
estimate the safety score of given architecture and system design without
physically testing them in an AV. We demonstrate the use of our safety score

classically expected power-law indices associated with the compression ratio,
diffusion length scales must exceed the width of the compression region. The
maximum attainable energies of shock-accelerated spectra are found to be
limited by the transit times of interplanetary shocks, while spectra may be
accelerated to higher energies in the presence of higher levels of magnetic
turbulence or at faster-moving shocks. Indeed, simulations suggest fast-moving
shocks are more likely to produce very high-energy particles, while strong
shocks, associated with harder shock-accelerated spectra, are linked to higher
intensities of energetic particles. The prior heating of the solar wind
distribution is found to complement shock acceleration in reproducing the
intensities of typical energetic storm particle events, especially where
injection energies are high. Moreover, simulations of $\sim$0.2 to 1 MeV proton
intensities are presented that naturally reproduce the observed flat energy
spectra prior to shock passages. Energetic particles accelerated from the solar
wind, aided by its prior heating, are shown to contribute substantially to
intensities during energetic storm particle events.

prove that these bases stitch together to a basis for the algebra C[N] of

Grassmannian, thus proving a conjecture of Anderson. In the third part of the
paper, we define a map from C[N] to a convolution algebra of measures on the
dual of the Cartan subalgebra of g. We characterize this map using the
universal centralizer space of G. We prove that the measure associated to an MV
basis element equals the Duistermaat-Heckman measure of the corresponding MV

map to measures to compare the MV basis and Lusztig's dual semicanonical basis.
We formulate conjectures relating the algebraic invariants of preprojective

1997, Wilson and Xiang gave a general framework for constructing Menon-Hadamard

type Q in ${\mathrm{PG}}(3,q)$. They also found examples of suitable spreads
and projective sets of type Q for $q=5,13,17$. Subsequently, Chen (1997)
succeeded in finding a spread and four projective sets of type Q in

Menon-Hadamard difference set of order $4q^4$ for all odd prime powers $q$.
However, the projective sets of type Q found by Chen have automorphisms
different from those of the examples constructed by Wilson and Xiang. In this
paper, we first generalize Chen's construction of projective sets of type Q by
using `semi-primitive' cyclotomic classes. This demonstrates that the
construction of projective sets of type Q satisfying the conditions in the
Wilson-Xiang construction is much more flexible than originally thought.
Secondly, we give a new construction of spreads and projective sets of type Q

Ferroelastic
DWs refer to those who separate two domains with unparalleled polarizations (or
two different ferroelastic variants). It is long believed that the structures
of ferroelastic DWs can be simply explained from the perspective of mechanical
and electric compatibilities in the framework of the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire
(LGD) theory. Here we show that the converse flexoelectricity must be taken
into account for fully describing the nature of ferroelastic DWs. In our work,
an unexpected asymmetric structure is identified, which is beyond the
prediction of the conventional LGD theory. By incorporating the converse
flexoelectricity into the LGD theory and using it to analyze high-resolution
images acquired by the aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope
(TEM), we demonstrate that it is the converse flexoelectricity that result in
the asymmetric structure. Moreover, the flexoelectric coefficient is derived by
quantifying the converse flexoelectricity around the DWs. This quantification
is deterministic in both the magnitude and sign of flexoelectric coefficients,
by the mutual verification of atomic mapping and first-principles calculations.
Our results suggest that the converse flexoelectricity cannot be neglected for
understanding the ferroelastic DWs and other boundaries in ferroelectric

added to the tree by selecting $r$ candidate vertices from the graph with
replacement according to a sampling probability proportional to these vertices'
degrees. The new vertex then connects to one of the candidates according to a
given probability associated to the ranking of their locations. In this paper,
we introduce a function that describes the phase transition when condensation
can occur. Considering the noncondensation phase, we use stochastic
approximation methods to investigate bounds for the (asymptotic) proportion of
vertices inside a given interval of a given maximum degree. We use these bounds
to observe a power law for the asymptotic degree distribution described by the

the radiative properties of a quantum emitter. In this article, we go beyond
the common electric dipole approximation for the molecular electronic
transition and take light-matter coupling through higher order multipoles into
account. We investigate, by means of theory and numerical simulations, a strong
enhancement of the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole emission channels of
a molecule adjacent to a plasmonic patch nanoantenna. While this on its own had
been considered, the assumption in prior work usually has been that each
molecular transition is dominated only by one of those multipolar emission
channels. This leads naturally to the notion of discussing the modified
emission in terms of a modified local density of states defined for each
specific multipolar transition. In reality, this restricts the applicability of
the approach, since specific molecular transitions occur via multiple
multipolar pathways that have to be considered all at once. Here, we introduce
a framework to study interference effects between higher order transitions in
molecules by (a) a rigorous quantum-chemical calculation of their multipolar
moments and (b) by a consecutive investigation of the transition rate upon
coupling to an arbitrarily shaped nanoantenna. Based on that formalism we
predict interference effects between these transition channels. This allows for
a strong suppression of radiation by exploiting destructive interference. Our
work suggests that placing a suitably chosen molecule at a well defined
position and at a well defined orientation relative to a nanoantenna can fully
suppress the transition probability.

its life deep inside the horizon and in the trans-Planckian regime, then leaves
the horizon as the speed of light corresponding to its growing wavelength
drops, to eventually become cis-Planckian whilst still outside the horizon, and
finally re-enter the horizon at late times. We find that scalar modes in the
observable range satisfy this condition, thus ensuring the viability of MDR
models in this respect. For tensor modes we find a regime in which this does
not occur, but in practice it can only be realised for wavelengths in the range

backbone for many natural and human-made materials such as gels, biological
tissues, metamaterials, and rubbers. Fracture processes in these networked
materials are intrinsically multiscale, and it is computationally prohibitive
to adopt a fully discrete approach for large scale systems. To overcome such a
challenge, we introduce an adaptive numerical algorithm for modeling fracture
in this class of materials, with a primary application to polymer networks,
using an extended version of the Quasi-Continuum method that accounts for both
material and geometric nonlinearities. In regions of high interest, for example
near crack tips, explicit representation of the local topology is retained
where each polymer chain is idealized using the worm like chain model. Away
from these imperfections, the degrees of freedom are limited to a fraction of
the network nodes and the network structure is computationally homogenized,
using the micro-macro energy consistency condition, to yield an anisotropic
material tensor consistent with the underlying network structure. A nonlinear
finite element framework is used to solve the system where dynamic adaptivity
allows transition between the continuum and discrete scales. The method enables
accurate modelling of crack propagation without a priori constraint on the
fracture energy while maintaining the influence of large-scale elastic loading
in the bulk. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the method by
applying it to study the fracture in different examples of network structures.
We further use the method to investigate the effects of network topology and
disorder on its fracture characteristics. We discuss the implications of our
method for multiscale analysis of fracture in networked material as they arise
in different applications in biology and engineering.

to build a high-quality speech synthesis system because auxiliary conditional
features estimated by a simple deep neural network often contain large
prediction errors, and the errors are inevitably propagated throughout the
autoregressive generation process of the ExcitNet vocoder. To generate more
natural speech signals, we exploited a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) acoustic
model with an attention-based generative network (e.g., Tacotron 2) to estimate
the condition parameters of the ExcitNet vocoder. Because the seq2seq acoustic
model accurately estimates spectral parameters, and because the ExcitNet model
effectively generates the corresponding time-domain excitation signals,
combining these two models can synthesize natural speech signals. Furthermore,
we verified the merit of the proposed method in producing expressive speech
segments by adopting a global style token-based emotion embedding method. The
experimental results confirmed that the proposed system significantly

  WENO-adaptive-order Reconstruction",,,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High-order gas-kinetic scheme (HGKS) has been well-developed in the past
years. Abundant numerical tests including hypersonic flow, turbulence, and
aeroacoustic problems, have been used to validate its accuracy, efficiency, and
robustness. However, there are still rooms for its further improvement.
Firstly, the reconstruction in the previous scheme mainly achieves a
third-order accuracy for the initial non-equilibrium states. At the same time,
the equilibrium state in space and time in HGKS has to be reconstructed
separately. Secondly, it is complicated to get reconstructed data at Gaussian
points from the WENO-type method in high dimensions. For HGKS, besides the
point-wise values at the Gaussian points it also requires the slopes in both
normal and tangential directions of a cell interface. Thirdly, there exists
visible spurious overshoot/undershoot at weak discontinuities from the previous
HGKS with the standard WENO reconstruction. In order to overcome these
difficulties, in this paper we use an improved reconstruction for HGKS. The
WENO with adaptive order (WENO-AO) method is implemented for reconstruction.A
whole polynomial inside each cell is provided in WENO-AO reconstruction. The
HGKS becomes simpler than the previous one with the direct implementation of
cell interface values and their slopes from WENO-AO. The additional
reconstruction of equilibrium state at the beginning of each time step can be
avoided as well by dynamically merging the reconstructed non-equilibrium
slopes. The new HGKS essentially releases or totally removes the above existing
problems in previous HGKS. The accuracy of the scheme from 1D to 3D from the
new HGKS can recover the theoretical order of accuracy of the WENO
reconstruction.In the two- and three-dimensional simulations, the new HGKS
shows better robustness and efficiency than the previous scheme in all test
cases.

particles must be projected to configuration space. Folds of a smooth
phase-space manifold give rise to catastrophes ('caustics') in this projection.
When the inertial particle dynamics is damped by friction, however, the
phase-space manifold converges towards a fractal attractor. It is believed that
caustics increase spatial clustering also in this case, but a quantitative
theory is missing. We solve this problem by determining how projection affects
the distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents. Applying our method in one
spatial dimension we find that caustics arising from the projection of a
dynamical fractal attractor ('fractal catastrophes') make a distinct and
universal contribution to the distribution of spatial finite-time Lyapunov
exponents. Our results explain a projection formula for the spatial fractal
correlation dimension, and how a fluctuation relation for the distribution of
finite-time Lyapunov exponents for white-in-time Gaussian force fields breaks
upon projection. We explore the implications of our results for heavy particles

multi-frame approaches achieve a substantial noise reduction with hardly any

of the speech presence probability (SPP) in each time-frequency (TF) bin. In
this paper, we propose to use a bi-directional long short-term memory deep

robust performance, the DNN is trained for various noise types and within a
large signal-to-noise-ratio range. Experimental results show that the MFMPDR in
combination with the proposed data-driven SPP estimator yields an increased

longitudinal polarization of the $D^*$ in $B\to D^*\tau\nu$, $F_L^{D^*}$. The
preferred solutions involve new left-handed currents or tensor contributions.
Interpretations with pure right-handed currents are disfavored by the LHC data,
while pure scalar models are disfavored by the upper limits derived either from
the LHC or from the $B_c$ lifetime. The observable $F_L^{D^*}$ also gives an
important constraint leading to the exclusion of large regions of parameter

capture fine details of the scene. Therefore a mesh refinement algorithm is
usually applied; it improves the mesh resolution and accuracy by minimizing the
photometric error induced by the 3D model into pairs of cameras. The choice of
these pairs significantly affects the quality of the refinement and usually
relies on sparse 3D points belonging to the surface. Instead, in this paper, to
increase the quality of pairs selection, we exploit the 3D model (before the
refinement) to compute five metrics: scene coverage, mutual image overlap,
image resolution, camera parallax, and a new symmetry term. To improve the
refinement robustness, we also propose an explicit method to manage occlusions,
which may negatively affect the computation of the photometric error. The

sorting with potentially interacting criteria. It employs an additive
piecewise-linear value function as the basic preference model, which is
augmented with components for handling the interactions. To construct such a
model from a given set of assignment examples concerning reference

complexity does not depend on the number of training samples, the proposed

estimation of functions of bounded variation ($BV$), meaning $L^1$ functions on

measures. The estimation of $BV$ functions is relevant in many applications,
since it involves minimal smoothness assumptions and gives simplified,
interpretable cartoonized reconstructions. In this paper we propose a novel

provide theoretical guaranties by showing that the proposed estimator is
minimax optimal up to logarithms with respect to the $L^q$-risk, for any

antarctica lipase B (CALB) was investigated combining experimental and
theoretical methodologies. Experiments showed the near-exclusive acylation of
lysine $\epsilon$-amino group; only traces of product resulting from the
acylation of lysine $\alpha$-amino group were observed fleetingly. Molecular
modelling simulations were performed aiming to understand the molecular rules
for selectivity. Flexible docking simulations combined with structural
investigations into lysine/CALB binding modes also suggested the preferential
acylation of lysine $\epsilon$-amino group without, however, excluding the
acylation of the lysine $\alpha$-amino group. Electrostatic interaction energy
between lysine and the residues covering the catalytic cavity was calculated in
order to understand the discrimination between the two lysine amino groups. The
results suggests that the proximity of the carboxylate group hinders the
binding of the substrate in configurations enabling the N$\alpha$-acylation.
Key interactions with the polar region covering the catalytic triad were
identified and a plausible explanation for selectivity was proposed.

pairwise contacts among them. However, the dynamic nature, which generates the
evolution of human contact networks, of contact patterns is not known yet.
Here, we analyse three empirical datasets and identify two crucial mechanisms
of the evolution of temporal human contact networks, i.e. the activity state
transition laws for an individual to be socially active, and the contact
establishment mechanism that active individuals adopt. We consider both of the
two mechanisms to propose a temporal network model, named the memory driven
(MD) model, of human contact networks. Then we study the susceptible-infected
(SI) spreading processes on empirical human contact networks and four
corresponding temporal network models, and compare the full prevalence time of
SI processes with various infection rates on the networks. The full prevalence
time of SI processes in the MD model is the same as that in real-world human
contact networks. Moreover, we find that the individual activity state
transition promotes the spreading process, while, the contact establishment of
active individuals suppress the prevalence. Apart from this, we observe that
even a small percentage of individuals to explore new social ties is able to
induce an explosive spreading on networks. The proposed temporal network
framework could help the further study of dynamic processes in temporal human
contact networks, and offer new insights to predict and control the diffusion
processes on networks.

cars, in our pockets, and sometimes even in our own bodies. For concerns of
safety, economy, and convenience, it is important that such systems work
correctly. However, it is a notoriously difficult task to ensure that the
software running on computers behaves correctly.
  One approach to ease this task is that of model checking, where a model of
the system is made using some mathematical formalism. Requirements expressed in
a formal language can then be verified against the model in order to give
guarantees that the model satisfies the requirements.
  For many computer systems, time is an important factor. As such, we need our
formalisms and requirement languages to be able to incorporate real time.
  We therefore develop formalisms and algorithms that allow us to compare and
express properties about real-time systems. We first introduce a logical
formalism for reasoning about upper and lower bounds on time, and study the
properties of this formalism, including axiomatisation and algorithms for
checking when a formula is satisfied.
  We then consider the question of when a system is faster than another system.
We show that this is a difficult question which can not be answered in general,
but we identify special cases where this question can be answered. We also show
that under this notion of faster-than, a local increase in speed may lead to a
global decrease in speed, and we take step towards avoiding this.
  Finally, we consider how to compare the real-time behaviour of systems not
just qualitatively, but also quantitatively. Thus, we are interested in knowing
how much one system is faster or slower than another system. This is done by
introducing a distance between systems. We show how to compute this distance
and that it behaves well with respect to certain properties.

essential for calculating the response of silicon detectors in the radiation
environment at accelerators like at the CERN LHC. Using 1-D calculations of
non-irradiated pad sensors and 1-D TCAD simulations of pad sensors before and
after irradiation, it is shown that the time-dependence of the weighting field
is related to the resistivity of low field regions with ohmic behaviour in the
sensor. A simple formula is derived, which relates the time constant of the
time-dependent weighting field, $\tau $, with the resistivity and the extension
of the low-field region for pad detectors. As the resistivity of irradiated
silicon increases with fluence and finally reaches the intrinsic resistivity,
$\tau $ becomes much larger than the charge-collection time and the weighting
field becomes essentially independent of time. The TCAD simulations show that
the transition from a time-dependent to a time-independent weighting field
occurs at a neutron-equivalent fluence of $ \approx 5 \times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$
for a 200 $\mu$m thick pad diode operated at 40 V and $- 20^\circ$C. It is
therefore concluded that the use of a time-independent weighting field
calculated with the same method as for a fully-depleted non-irradiated sensor
is also appropriate for the simulation of highly irradiated silicon sensors.

two-stage efficient quantile regression estimation. Our asymptotic theory holds

variational model is implemented to purify and smooth the initialization,
followed by the second stage which is to project the smoothed partition
obtained at stage one to a binary partition. These two stages can be repeated,
with the latest result as a new initialization, to keep improving the
classification quality. We show that the convex model of the smoothing stage
has a unique solution and can be solved by a specifically designed primal-dual

be any nonaffine continuous function, with a continuous nonzero derivative at
some point. Then we show that the class of neural networks of arbitrary depth,
width $n + m + 2$, and activation function $\rho$, is dense in $C(K;
\mathbb{R}^m)$ for $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ with $K$ compact. This covers
every activation function possible to use in practice, and also includes
polynomial activation functions, which is unlike the classical version of the
theorem, and provides a qualitative difference between deep narrow networks and
shallow wide networks. We then consider several extensions of this result. In
particular we consider nowhere differentiable activation functions, density in
noncompact domains with respect to the $L^p$-norm, and how the width may be
reduced to just $n + m + 1$ for `most' activation functions.

some mass-luminosity relation.To demonstrate the potential of the algorithm, we
consider the orbits of 98 Hipparcos astrometric binaries with main-sequence

use of attention mechanisms, recurrent layers, neural ordinary differential
equations (ODEs), and medical concept embeddings with time-aware attention were
trained using publicly available electronic medical record data (MIMIC-III)
associated with 45,298 ICU stays for 33,150 patients. Bayesian inference was
used to compute the posterior over weights of an attention-based model. Odds
ratios associated with an increased risk of readmission were computed for
static variables. Diagnoses, procedures, medications, and vital signs were
ranked according to the associated risk of readmission. Results: A recurrent
neural network, with time dynamics of code embeddings computed by neural ODEs,
achieved the highest average precision of 0.331 (AUROC: 0.739, F1-Score:
0.372). Predictive accuracy was comparable across neural network architectures.
Groups of patients at risk included those suffering from infectious
complications, with chronic or progressive conditions, and for whom standard
medical care was not suitable. Conclusions: Attention-based networks may be
preferable to recurrent networks if an interpretable model is required, at only
marginal cost in predictive accuracy.

semigroups of linear operators $P_{t},t\geq 0$. In order to do it, we fix a
time horizon $T $ and the discretization steps $h_{l}=\frac{T}{n^{l}},l\in
\mathbb{N}$ and we suppose that we have at hand some short time approximation
operators $Q_{l}$ such that $P_{h_{l}}=Q_{l}+O(h_{l}^{1+\alpha })$ for some
$\alpha >0$. Then, we consider random time grids $\Pi (\omega )=\{t_0(\omega
)=0<t_{1}(\omega )<...<t_{m}(\omega )=T\}$ such that for all $1\le k\le m$,
$t_{k}(\omega )-t_{k-1}(\omega )=h_{l_{k}}$ for some $l_{k}\in \mathbb{N}$, and
we associate the approximation discrete semigroup $P_{T}^{\Pi (\omega
)}=Q_{l_{n}}...Q_{l_{1}}.$ Our main result is the following: for any
approximation order $\nu $, we can construct random grids $\Pi_{i}(\omega )$
and coefficients $c_{i}$, with $i=1,...,r$ such that \[
P_{t}f=\sum_{i=1}^{r}c_{i}\mathbb{E}(P_{t}^{\Pi _{i}(\omega )}f(x))+O(n^{-\nu})
\]% with the expectation concerning the random grids $\Pi _{i}(\omega ).$
Besides, $\text{Card}(\Pi _{i}(\omega ))=O(n)$ and the complexity of the
algorithm is of order $n$, for any order of approximation $\nu$. The standard
example concerns diffusion processes, using the Euler approximation for~$Q_l$.
In this particular case and under suitable conditions, we are able to gather
the terms in order to produce an estimator of $P_tf$ with finite variance.
However, an important feature of our approach is its universality in the sense
that it works for every general semigroup $P_{t}$ and approximations. Besides,
approximation schemes sharing the same $\alpha$ lead to the same random grids
$\Pi_{i}$ and coefficients $c_{i}$. Numerical illustrations are given for
ordinary differential equations, piecewise deterministic Markov processes and
diffusions.

Therefore, we introduce conditional SPNs (CSPNs), conditional density
estimators for multivariate and potentially hybrid domains which allow
harnessing the expressive power of neural networks while still maintaining
tractability guarantees. One way to implement CSPNs is to use an existing SPN
structure and condition its parameters on the input, e.g., via a deep neural
network. This approach, however, might misrepresent the conditional
independence structure present in data. Consequently, we also develop a
structure-learning approach that derives both the structure and parameters of
CSPNs from data. Our experimental evidence demonstrates that CSPNs are
competitive with other probabilistic models and yield superior performance on
multilabel image classification compared to mean field and mixture density
networks. Furthermore, they can successfully be employed as building blocks for
structured probabilistic models, such as autoregressive image models.

structure, in which the outer layer provides the estimation of the posterior
distribution of the unknown parameters and the inner layer provides the
estimation of the posterior distribution of the state variables. This algorithm
has a similar structure as the so-called recursive nested particle filter, but
unlike the latter filter, in which both layers use a particle filter, this
proposed algorithm introduces a dynamic kernel to sample the parameter
particles in the outer layer to obtain a higher convergence speed. Moreover,
this algorithm also implements the Kalman filter in the inner layer to reduce
the computational time. This algorithm can also be used to estimate the
parameters that suddenly change value. We prove that, for a state space model

$\delta$ is the maximum time step between two consecutive observations. We

orders, and voicing using first-order Markov process models. Using these Markov
models, fundamental frequency estimation and voicing detection errors can be
reduced. Using the harmonic model, the proposed fundamental frequency tracker
has an improved robustness to noise. An analytical form of the likelihood
function, which can be computed efficiently, is derived. Compared to the
state-of-the-art neural network and non-parametric approaches, the proposed
fundamental frequency tracking algorithm reduces the mean absolute errors and
gross errors by 15\% and 20\% on the Keele pitch database and 36\% and 26\% on

algorithm that can start from any initial configuration of the network (i.e.,
every node has an arbitrary value assigned to each of its variables), and

leader election does not have a deterministic self-stabilizing algorithm using
a constant-size register at each node, i.e., for some networks, some of their

On the other hand, it is also known that leader election can be solved by a
deterministic self-stabilizing algorithm using registers of $O(\log \log n)$
bits per node in any $n$-node bounded-degree network. We show that this latter
space complexity is optimal. Specifically, we prove that every deterministic
self-stabilizing algorithm solving leader election must use $\Omega(\log \log

state when the system's semiclassical phase space is mixed, i.e., regions of
chaotic motion coexist with regular islands. In recent years, there has been
much effort to understand the process of thermalization in strongly interacting
quantum systems that often lack an obvious semiclassical limit. Time-dependent
variational principle (TDVP) allows to systematically derive an effective
classical (nonlinear) dynamical system by projecting unitary many-body dynamics
onto a manifold of weakly-entangled variational states. We demonstrate that
such dynamical systems generally possess mixed phase space. When TDVP errors
are small, the mixed phase space leaves a footprint on the exact dynamics of
the quantum model. For example, when the system is initialized in a state
belonging to a stable periodic orbit or the surrounding regular region, it
exhibits persistent many-body quantum revivals. As a proof of principle, we
identify new types of ""quantum many-body scars"", i.e., initial states that lead
to long-time oscillations in a model of interacting Rydberg atoms in one and
two dimensions. Intriguingly, the initial states that give rise to most robust
revivals are typically entangled states. On the other hand, even when TDVP
errors are large, as in the thermalizing tilted-field Ising model, initializing
the system in a regular region of phase space leads to slowdown of
thermalization. Our work establishes TDVP as a method for identifying
interacting quantum systems with anomalous dynamics in arbitrary dimensions.
Moreover, the mixed-phase space classical variational equations allow to find
slowly-thermalizing initial conditions in interacting models. Our results shed
light on a link between classical and quantum chaos, pointing towards possible
extensions of classical Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem to quantum systems.

galactic potential, not only renders the flow to be multi-transonic in nature,
the flow topology resembles `$X\alpha$' and `$\alpha X$' type trajectories of
advective flows in the vicinity of the BHs/compact objects. Owing to the
influence of the galactic potential, the entire range of galactic mass-to-light
ratio ($\Upsilon_B$) allows shock formation in central to the outer radial
regions of our wind-type flows, with the strength of those galactic induced
shocks found to be comparable to that of the shocks one would expect in the
advective flows in the vicinity of a BH. We also observe that the shock
parameters remain sensitive to $\Upsilon_B$. We discussed the possible
implication of these shocks in the context of radio source dynamics as well as
their potential association with flaring in radio jets. Our study also reveals
that galactic potential could substantially augment the mass inflow rate.

such as the existence of embedded chromatographic peaks, continuum background
and overlapping in mass channels for different components. These problems cause
rotational ambiguity in recovered profiles calculated using multivariate curve
resolution (MCR) methods. Since mass spectra are sparse in nature, sparsity has
been proposed recently as a constraint in MCR methods for analyzing LC-MS data.
There are different ways for implementation of the sparsity constraint, and
majority of methods rely on imposing a penalty based on the L0-, L1- and
L2-norms of recovered mass spectra. Ridge regression and least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) can be used for implementation of L2-
and L1-norm penalties in MCR, respectively. The main question is which Lx-norm
penalty is more worthwhile for implementation of the sparsity constraint in MCR
methods. In order to address this question, two and three component LC-MS data
were simulated and used for the case study in this work. The areas of feasible
solutions (AFS) were calculated using the grid search strategy. Calculating
Lx-norms values in AFS for x between zero and two revealed that the gradient of
optimization surface increased from x values equal to two to x values near
zero. However, for x equal to zero, the optimization surface was similar to a
plateau, which increased the risk of sticking in local minima. Generally,
results in this work, recommend the use of L1-norm penalty methods like Lasso
for implementation of sparsity constraint in MCR-ALS algorithm for finding more
sparse solutions and reducing the extent of rotational ambiguity.

time-variable cross section was corrected using the radar shape model. We find
that Toutatis has a geometric albedo $p_\mathrm{V} = 0.185^{+0.045}_{-0.039} $,
which is typical of S-type asteroids. We compare the geometric albedo with
archival polarimetric data and further find that the polarimetric slope--albedo
law provides a reliable estimate for the albedo of this S-type asteroid. The
thermal infrared observation also produced similar results if the size of the
asteroid is updated to match the results from Chang'e-2. We conjecture that the
surface of Toutatis is covered with grains smaller than that of the near-Sun
asteroids including (1566) Icarus and (3200) Phaethon.

that can be used as tracers of processes that feed turbulence. Aims: We used HI
survey data to derive global properties of the angular power distribution of
the local ISM. Methods: HI4PI observations on an nside = 1024 HEALPix grid and
Gaussian components representing three phases, the cold, warm, and unstable
lukewarm neutral medium (CNM, WNM, and LNM), were used for velocities
$|v_{\mathrm{LSR}}| \leq 25$ \kms. For high latitudes $|b| > 20\deg$ we
generated apodized maps. After beam deconvolution we fitted angular power
spectra. Results: Power spectra for observed column densities are exceptionally
well defined and straight in log-log presentation with 3D power law indices
$\gamma \geq -3$ for the local gas. For intermediate velocity clouds (IVCs) we
derive $\gamma = -2.6$ and for high velocity clouds (HVCs) $\gamma = -2.0$.
Single-phase power distributions for the CNM, LNM, and WNM are highly
correlated and shallow with $ \gamma \sim -2.5$ for multipoles $l \leq 100$.
Excess power from cold filamentary structures is observed at larger multipoles.
The steepest single-channel power spectra for the CNM are found at velocities
with large CNM and low WNM phase fractions. Conclusions: The phase space
distribution in the local ISM is configured by phase transitions and needs to
be described with three distinct different phases, being highly correlated but
having distributions with different properties. Phase transitions cause locally
hierarchical structures in phase space. The CNM is structured on small scales
and is restricted in position-velocity space. The LNM as an interface to the
WNM envelops the CNM. It extends to larger scales than the CNM and covers a
wider range of velocities. Correlations between the phases are self-similar in
velocity.

latent discriminative probabilities successfully reduces the difference in
responses between the most salient regions and the others. Therefore, MAAN is
able to generate better class activation sequences and identify dense and
integral action regions in the videos. Moreover, we propose a fast algorithm to
reduce the complexity of constructing MAA from O($2^T$) to O($T^2$). Extensive
experiments on two large-scale video datasets show that our MAAN achieves

degrees of freedom are coupled to a massless scalar field in $(1+1)$D Minkowski
space. We use the influence functional formalism to derive the Langevin
equations governing the nonequilibrium dynamics of the internal degrees of
freedom and show explicitly that the system relaxes in time and equilibrates.
We also show that once the equilibrium condition is established a set of
fluctuation-dissipation relations (FDR) and correlation-propagation relations
(CPR) emerges for the detectors, extending earlier results of [1] which
discovered these relations for the quantum field. Although similar in form to
the FDRs commonly known from linear response theory, which assumes an
equilibrium condition a priori, their physical connotations are dissimilar from
that of a nonequilibrium origin. We show explicitly that both sets of relations
are needed to guarantee the balance of energy flow in and out of the system in
dynamical equilibrium with the field. These results are helpful to
investigations of quantum information and communications of detectors in space
experiments and inquiries of theoretical issues in black holes and cosmology.

the category of modules over an Artin algebra) can be connected to the
representation theory of all modules over some algebra. The subcategories
dealing with are some certain subcategories of the morphism categories
(including submodule categories studied recently by Ringel and Schmidmeier) and
of the Gorenstein projective modules over (relative) stable Auslander algebras.
These two kinds of subcategories, as will be seen, are closely related to each
other. To make such a connection, we will define a functor from each type of
the subcategories to the category of modules over some Artin algebra. It is
shown that to compute the almost split sequences in the subcategories it is
enough to do the computation with help of the corresponding functors in the
category of modules over some Artin algebra which is known and easier to work.
Then as an application the most part of Auslander-Reiten quiver of the
subcategories is obtained only by the Ausalander-Reiten quiver of an
appropriate algebra and next adding the remaining vertices and arrows in an
obvious way. As a special case, whenever $\Lambda$ is a Gorenstein Artin
algebra of finite representation type, then the subcategories of Gorenstein
projective modules over the $2 \times 2$ upper triangular matrix algebra over
$\Lambda$ and the stable Auslander algebra of $\Lambda$ can be estimated by the
category of modules over the stable Cohen-Macaulay Auslander algebra of
$\Lambda$.

Reality, but they are also notoriously difficult to reconstruct accurately. For
example, they are a challenge for stereo-based reconstruction methods, as
points around an occluding contour are visible in only one image. Inspired by
recent methods that introduce normal estimation to improve depth prediction, we
introduce a novel term that constrains depth and occluding contours
predictions. Since ground truth depth is difficult to obtain with pixel-perfect
accuracy along occluding contours, we use synthetic images for training,
followed by fine-tuning on real data. We demonstrate our approach on the
challenging NYUv2-Depth dataset, and show that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art along occluding contours, while performing on par with the
best recent methods for the rest of the images. Its accuracy along the
occluding contours is actually better than the `ground truth' acquired by a

We showed that detectors yield a linear response in a wide range of radiation
power. At high powers the response saturates varying with radiation power P as
$U = R_0 P/(1+P/P_s)$, where $R_0$ is the low power responsivity, $P_s$ is the
saturation power. We demonstrated that the linear part response decreases with
radiation frequency increase as $R_0 \propto f^{-3}$, whereas the power at
which signal saturates increases as $P_s \propto f^3$. We discussed the
observed dependences in the framework of the Dyakonov-Shur mechanism and
detector-antenna impedance matching. Our study showed that FET transistors can
be used as ultrafast room temperature detectors of THz radiation and that their
dynamic range extends over many orders of magnitude of power of incoming THz

developed for computer modeling in engineering and sciences. In the FPM,
simple, local, polynomial, discontinuous and Point-based trial and test
functions are proposed based on randomly scattered points in the problem
domain. The local discontinuous polynomial trial and test functions are
postulated by using the Generalized Finite Difference method. These functions
are only piece-wise continuous over the global domain. By implementing the
Point-based trial and test functions into the Galerkin weak form, we define the
concept of Point Stiffnesses as the contribution of each Point in the problem
domain to the global stiffness matrix. However, due to the discontinuity of
trial and test functions in the domain, directly using the Galerkin weak form
leads to inconsistency. To resolve this, Numerical Flux Corrections, which are
frequently used in Discontinuous Galerkin methods are further employed in the
FPM. The resulting global stiffness matrix is symmetric and sparse, which is
advantageous for large-scale engineering computations. Several numerical
examples of 1D and 2D Poisson equations are given in this paper to demonstrate
the high accuracy, robustness and convergence of the FPM. Because of the
locality and discontinuity of the Point-based trial and test functions, this
method can be easily extended to model extreme problems in mechanics, such as
fragility, rupture, fracture, damage, and fragmentation. These extreme problems
will be discussed in our future studies.

(3) visualisation of pathology in subcortical regions in Huntington's disease.

have been discovered. Nearly all of them orbit around the central binary very
closely to the region of instability where it is difficult to form them in
situ. It is assumed that they formed further out and migrated to their observed
position. We extend previous studies to a more realistic thermal disc structure
and determine what parameter influence the final parking location of a planet
around a binary star. We perform two-dimensional numerical simulations of
viscous accretion discs around a central binary that include viscous heating
and radiative cooling from the disc surfaces. We vary the binary eccentricity
as well as disc viscosity and mass. Concerning the disc evolution we find that
it can take well over 100000 binary orbits until an equilibrium state is
reached. As seen previously, we find that the central cavity opened by the
binary becomes eccentric and precesses slowly in a prograde sense. Embedded
planets migrate to the inner edge of the disc. In cases of lower disc viscosity
they migrate further in maintaining a circular orbit, while for high viscosity
they are parked further out on an eccentric orbit. The final location of an
embedded planet is linked to its ability to open a gap in the disc. Gap opening
planets separate inner from outer disc, preventing eccentricity excitation in
the latter and making it more circular. This allows embedded planets to migrate
closer to the binary, in agreement with the observations. The necessary
condition for gap opening and the final planet position depend on the planet
mass and disc viscosity.

performance to a baseline case where no shared information is extracted. We use
synthetic datasets with different levels of interdependency between feature and

  via a Polyhedral Viewpoint",,,,,"cs.DS cs.DM math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Relaxation and rounding approaches became a standard and extremely versatile
tool for constrained submodular function maximization. One of the most common
rounding techniques in this context are contention resolution schemes. Such
schemes round a fractional point by first rounding each coordinate
independently, and then dropping some elements to reach a feasible set. Also
the second step, where elements are dropped, is typically randomized. This
leads to an additional source of randomization within the procedure, which can
complicate the analysis. We suggest a different, polyhedral viewpoint to design
contention resolution schemes, which avoids to deal explicitly with the
randomization in the second step. This is achieved by focusing on the marginals
of a dropping procedure. Apart from avoiding one source of randomization, our
viewpoint allows for employing polyhedral techniques. Both can significantly
simplify the construction and analysis of contention resolution schemes. We
show how, through our framework, one can obtain an optimal monotone contention
resolution scheme for bipartite matchings. So far, only very few results are
known about optimality of monotone contention resolution schemes. Our
contention resolution scheme for the bipartite case also improves the lower
bound on the correlation gap for bipartite matchings. Furthermore, we derive a
monotone contention resolution scheme for matchings that significantly improves
over the previously best one. At the same time, our scheme implies that the
currently best lower bound on the correlation gap for matchings is not tight.
Our results lead to improved approximation factors for various constrained
submodular function maximization problems over a combination of matching
constraints with further constraints.

A typical way to achieve this is with reliability demonstration tests (RDTs),
in which a number of products are put on test and the test is passed if a
target reliability is achieved. There are various methods for determining the
sample size for RDTs, typically based on the power of a hypothesis test
following the RDT or risk criteria. Bayesian risk criteria approaches can
conflate the choice of sample size and the analysis to be undertaken once the
test has been conducted and rely on the specification of somewhat artificial
acceptable and rejectable reliability levels. In this paper we offer an
alternative approach to sample size determination based on the idea of
assurance. This approach chooses the sample size to answer provide a certain
probability that the RDT will result in a successful outcome. It separates the
design and analysis of the RDT, allowing different priors for each. We develop
the assurance approach for sample size calculations in RDTs for binomial and

to reduce the losses of the hybrid mode, enhancing the propagation length above

to the nature of these models as well as the practical challenges which include

studies have focused on studying the time series of cutting processes using
machine learning algorithms with the goal of identifying and predicting
undesirable vibrations during machining referred to as chatter. These tools
typically decompose the signal using Wavelet Packet Transforms (WPT) or
Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). However, these methods require a
significant overhead in identifying the feature vectors before a classifier can
be trained. In this study, we present an alternative approach based on
featurizing the time series of the cutting process using its topological
features. We first embed the time series as a point cloud using Takens
embedding. We then utilize Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random
Forest and Gradient Boosting classifier combined with feature vectors derived
from persistence diagrams, a tool from persistent homology, to encode chatter's
distinguishing characteristics. We present the results for several choices of
the topological feature vectors, and we compare our results to the WPT and EEMD
methods using experimental turning data. Our results show that in two out of
four cutting configurations the TDA-based features yield accuracies as high as
97%. We also show that combining Bezier curve approximation method and parallel
computing can reduce runtime for persistence diagram computation of a single

to investigate the magnetic and dynamic solar atmosphere. However, in order to
develop solar diagnosis, it is fundamental to understand the different kinds of
anomalous solar signals that have been routinely found in linear and circular
polarization (LP,CP). The goal of this paper has been to explain and
characterize the morphology of solar CP signals by understanding the combined
effect of magnetic fields, velocity gradients, and atomic orientation in
general NLTE regime. To that aim, an analytical two-layer model of the
polarized radiative transfer equation is developed and used to solve the NLTE
problem with atomic polarization in a semi-parametric way. The formation of
polarization is thus insightfully described with certain precision without
resorting in MHD models or sacrifying key physical ingredients. The potential
of the model for reproducing solar anomalous CP is shown with detailed
calculations. The essential physical behavior of dichroism and atomic
orientation is described, introducing the concepts of dichroic inversion,
neutral and reinforcing medium, critic intensity spectrum, and critic source
function. It is shown that the zero-crossings of the CP spectrum are useful to
classify its morphology and understand its formation. This led to identify and
explain the morphology of the seven most characteristics CP signals that a
single (depth-resolved) scattering layer can produce. Futhermore, it is found
that a minimal number of two magnetic layers along the LOS is required to fully
explain anomalous solar CP signals, and that the morphology and polarity of
Stokes V depends on magnetic, radiative and atomic polarities. Some
implications of these results are presented through a preliminar modeling of
anomalous CP signals in the Na I D and Fe I 1564.8 nm lines.

unknown. However, great progress has been achieved in past years due to the
observations performed by the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array.
Above $10^{18}$ eV the observed energy spectrum presents two features: a
hardening of the slope at about $10^{18.7}$ eV, which is known as the ankle and
a suppression at approximately $10^{19.6}$ eV. The composition inferred from
the experimental data, interpreted by using the current high energy hadronic
interaction models, seems to be light below the ankle, showing a trend to
heavier nuclei for increasing values of the primary energy. Current high energy
hadronic interaction models, updated by using Large Hadron Collider data, are
still subject to large systematic uncertainties, which makes difficult the
interpretation of the experimental data in terms of composition. On the other
hand, it is very well known that gamma rays and neutrinos are produced by
UHECRs during propagation from their sources, as a consequence of their
interactions with the radiation field present in the universe. The flux at
Earth of these secondary particles depends on the source models of UHECRs
including the chemical composition at injection. Therefore, both gamma-ray and
neutrino observations can be used to constrain source models of UHECRs,
including the composition in a way which is independent of the high energy

Supersymmetry (SUSY) have shown and demonstrated the ability to suppress
unwanted lasing modes and, thus, achieved single mode lasing operation through
the addition of lossy passive elements. While these approaches enable laser
engineering versatility, they rely on the drawback of adding optical losses to
a system tasked to produce single mode gain. Unlike PT and SUSY lasers, here we
show an extra loss-free non-Hermitian laser engineering approach to realize
single mode lasing operation for the first time. By selectively enhancing the
fundamental modes quality factor, we obtain single mode operation with higher
output power per cavity since all cavities in this system contribute to the
laser output, in contrast to other non-Hermitian approaches. Furthermore, we
show that this approach interestingly allows reducing the number of
to-be-designed cavities in super-partner array as compared with, for example,
the SUSY approach, thus leading to reduced design complexity upon coupled
cavity scale up of laser arrays. In summary, the ability to engineer coupled
laser systems where each laser cavity contributes to coherent light
amplification opens up a new degree of laser-design freedom leading to
increased device performance and simultaneous reduced design and fabrication
complexity.

important components of the oceanic carbon sink. Carbon rich water from
shelf-seas is exported at depth to the open ocean, a process known as the
continental shelf pump, with open-ocean surface water moving (transported) onto
the shelf driving the export at depth. Existing methods to study shelf-wide
exchange focus on the wind or geostrophic currents, often ignoring their
combined effect, spatial heterogeniety or any other ageostrophic components.
Here we investigate the influence that wind, wave and current interactions can
have on surface transport and carbon export across continental shelves. Using a
21 year global re-analysis dataset we confirm that geostrophic and wind driven
Ekman processes are important for the transport of water onto shelf seas; but
the dominance of each is location and season dependent. A global wave model
re-analysis shows that one type of ageostrophic flow, Stokes drift due to
waves, can also be significant. A regional case study using two submesocale
model simulations identifies that up to 100% of the cross-shelf surface flow in
European seas can be due to ageostrophic components. Using these results and
grouping shelf-seas based on their observed carbon accumulation rates shows
that differences in rates are consistent with imbalances between the processes
driving atmosphere-ocean exchange at the surface and those driving carbon
export at depth. Therefore expected future changes in wind and wave climate
support the need to monitor cross-shelf transport and the size of the
continental shelf-sea carbon pump. The results presented show that the Sea
Surface Kinematics Multiscale monitoring satellite mission (SKIM), will be
capable of providing measurements of the total cross-shelf current, which are
now needed to enable routine monitoring of the global continental shelf-sea

formation predictions in the presence a hot component of arbitrary mass, and,
if desired, to include non-gravitational modifications to the clustering of
matter on large scales. We test the accuracy of the method by comparing its
predictions to a suite of simulations carried out explicitly including a
neutrino component in its evolution equations. We find that, for neutrino
masses in the range $M_\nu \in [0.06, 0.3] ~ \mathrm{eV}$ the matter power

diffusive behabvior at long times. The statistics of $\langle d^n\rangle$ at
all times are multiscaling, since the probability distribution function (pdf)
of displacements has very broad wings. Even where a diffusion constant can be
identified it is a complex function of $\phi$ and $\langle v^2\rangle$. By
identifying the relevant length and time scales and their interdependence one
can rescale the data for the mean square displacement and the pdf of
displacements into collapsed scaling functions for all $\phi$ and $\langle
v^2\rangle$. These scaling functions provide a predictive tool, allowing to
infer from one set of measurements (at a given $\phi$ and $\langle v^2\rangle$)
what are the expected results at any value of $\phi$ and $\langle v^2\rangle$.

approach to generate two-dimensional (2D) marine low cloud reflectance fields.
AI-CD uses a conditional generative adversarial net (cGAN) framework to model
distribution of 2-D cloud reflectance in nature as observed by the MODerate
resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). Specifically, the AI-CD models the
conditional distribution of cloud reflectance fields given a set of large-scale
environmental conditions such as instantaneous sea surface temperature,
estimated inversion strength, surface wind speed, relative humidity and
large-scale subsidence rate together with random noise. We show that AI-CD can
not only generate realistic cloudy scenes but also capture known, physical
dependence of cloud properties on large-scale variables. AI-CD is stochastic in
nature because generated cloud fields are influenced by random noise.
Therefore, given a fixed set of large-scale variables, an ensemble of cloud
reflectance fields can be generated using AI-CD. We suggest that AI-CD approach
can be used as a data driven framework for stochastic cloud parameterization
because it can realistically model sub-grid cloud distributions and their
sensitivity to meteorological variables.

competitive performance. However, local feature that is helpful towards better

allow GAPLayer to aggregate different features from independent heads. Thirdly,

Many recent works mainly focus on integrating the Fully Convolutional Network
(FCN) architecture with sophisticated convolution implementation and deep
supervision. In this paper, we propose to decompose the single segmentation
task into three subsequent sub-tasks, including (1) pixel-wise image
segmentation, (2) prediction of the class labels of the objects within the
image, and (3) classification of the scene the image belonging to. While these
three sub-tasks are trained to optimize their individual loss functions of
different perceptual levels, we propose to let them interact by the task-task
context ensemble. Moreover, we propose a novel sync-regularization to penalize
the deviation between the outputs of the pixel-wise segmentation and the class
prediction tasks. These effective regularizations help FCN utilize context
information comprehensively and attain accurate semantic segmentation, even
though the number of the images for training may be limited in many biomedical
applications. We have successfully applied our framework to three diverse 2D/3D
medical image datasets, including Robotic Scene Segmentation Challenge 18
(ROBOT18), Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 18 (BRATS18), and Retinal Fundus
Glaucoma Challenge (REFUGE18). We have achieved top-tier performance in all

even-order paired tensors. There is a particular tensor unfolding which gives
rise to an isomorphism from this tensor space to the general linear group, i.e.
the group of invertible matrices. By leveraging this unfolding operation, one
can extend classical linear time-invariant (LTI) system notions including
stability, reachability and observability to MLTI systems. While the unfolding
based formulation is a powerful theoretical construct, the computational
advantages of MLTI systems can only be fully realized while working with the
tensor form, where hidden patterns/structures can be exploited for efficient
representations and computations. Along these lines, we establish new results

that the RPV SUSY can explain the $R_{D^{(*)}}$ anomalies at $2\sigma$ level,
after taking into account various flavour constraints. In the allowed parameter
space, the differential branching fractions and LFU ratios are largely enhanced
by the SUSY effects, especially in the large dilepton invariant mass region. In

simulations are essential for studying particle acceleration during magnetic
reconnection, a reduced $m_i/m_e$ is often used to alleviate the demanding
computing resources, which leads to artificial scale separation between
electron and proton scales. Recent kinetic simulations with high-mass-ratio
have suggested new regimes of reconnection, as electron pressure anisotropy
develops in the exhaust region and supports extended current layers. In this
work, we study whether different $m_i/m_e$ changes the particle acceleration
processes by performing a series of simulations with different mass ratio
($m_i/m_e=25-400$) and guide-field strength in a low-$\beta$ plasma. We find
that mass ratio does not strongly influence reconnection rate, magnetic energy
conversion, ion internal energy gain, plasma energization processes, ion energy
spectra, and the acceleration mechanisms for high-energy ions. Simulations with
different mass ratios are different in electron acceleration processes,
including electron internal energy gain, electron energy spectrum and the
acceleration efficiencies for high-energy electrons. We find that high-energy
electron acceleration becomes less efficient when the mass ratio gets larger
because the \textit{Fermi}-like mechanism associated with particle curvature
drift becomes less efficient. These results indicate that when particle
curvature drift dominates high-energy particle acceleration, the further the
particle kinetic scales are from the magnetic field curvature scales ($\sim

  apertures",,,"10.1364/AO.382854",,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coded aperture snapshot spectral imager (CASSI) is a computational imaging
system that acquires a three dimensional (3D) spectral data cube by single or a
few two dimensional (2D) measurements. Binary random coded apertures with
square pixels are primarily implemented in CASSI systems to modulate the
spectral images in spatial domain. The design and optimization of coded
apertures was shown to improve the imaging performance of these systems
significantly. This work proposes a different approach to code design. Instead
of traditional squared tiled coded elements, hexagonal tiled elements are used.
The dislocation between the binary hexagonal pixels on coded apertures and the
square pixels on detector introduces equivalent grey-scale spatial modulation
to increase the degrees of freedom in the sensing matrix, thus further
improving the spectral imaging performance. Then, this paper presents an
optimal structure under the criterion of satisfying the restricted isometry
property (RIP) with high probability, coined blue noise (BN) coded apertures.
In addition, this paper studies and verifies the proposed hexagonal blue noise
coded aperture method on a general CASSI system, where the resolution of the
coded aperture is equivalent to that of the detector. Based on the RIP
criterion, this paper theoretically proves the superiority of the hexagonal
blue noise coded aperture over the traditional random coded aperture with
square lattice.

dark energy, and inflation first formulated in 2008. Our minimal affine
extension of the GR has geodesics coinciding with the pseudo Riemannian ones,
up to parameterizations. It predicts a `sterile' massive vecton and depends on
two new dimensional constants, which can be measured in the limit of small
vecton velocity. In a special gauge, this velocity has an upper limit near
which it grows to infinity. The linearized vecton theory is similar to the
scalar models of inflation except the fact of internal anisotropy of the
vecton. For this reason we study general solutions of scalar analogs of the
vecton theory without restricting the curvature parameter and anisotropy by
using previously derived exact solutions as functions of the metric. It is
shown that the effects of curvature and anisotropy fast decrease in expanding
universes. Our approach can be applied to anisotropic universes, which is
demonstrated on an exactly solvable strongly anisotropic cosmology. To
characterize different cosmological scenarios in detail we introduce three
characteristic functions, two of which are small and almost equal during
inflation and grow near the exit. Instead of the potential it is possible to
use one of the two characteristic functions. This allows to approximately
derive flat isotropic universes with `prescribed' scenarios, which is the
essence of our constructive cosmology of early universes. The most natural
application of our approach is in analytically constructing characteristic
functions of inflationary models with natural exits. However, the general
construction can be applied to other problems, e.g., to evolution of
contracting universes.

in TensorFlow for the integration of stiff chemical kinetics is introduced.
Numerical solutions to differential equations are at the core of computational
fluid dynamics calculations. As the size and complexity of the simulations
grow, so does the need for computational power and time. Many efforts have been
made to implement stiff chemistry solvers on GPUs but have not been highly
successful because of the logical divergence in traditional stiff solver
algorithms. Because of these constrains, a novel Explicit Stabilized
Variable-load (STEV) solver has been developed. Overstepping due to the
relatively large time steps is prevented by introducing limits to the maximum
changes of chemical species per time step. To prevent oscillations, a discrete
Fourier transform is introduced to dampen ringing. In contrast to conventional
explicit approaches, a variable-load approach is used where each cell in the
computational domain is advanced with its unique time step. This approach
allows cells to be integrated simultaneously while maintaining warp convergence
but finish at different iterations and be removed from the workload. To improve
the computational performance of the introduced solver, specific thermodynamic
quantities of interest were estimated using shallow neural networks in place of
polynomial fits, leading to an additional 10% savings in clock time with
minimal training and implementation requirements. However ML specific hardware
could increase the time savings to as much as 28%. While the complexity of
these particular machine learning models is not high by modern standards, the
impact on computational efficiency should not be ignored. The results show a
dramatic decrease in total chemistry solution time (over 200 times) while
maintaining a similar degree of accuracy.

of the world's energy consumption. However, the energy use of buildings,
especially the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC), is far from
being efficient. There still exists a dramatic potential to save energy through
improving building energy efficiency. Therefore, this paper studies the control
of HVAC system for multi-zone buildings with the objective to reduce energy
consumption cost while satisfying thermal comfort. In particular, the thermal
couplings due to the heat transfer between the adjacent zones are incorporated
in the optimization. Considering that a centralized method is generally
computationally prohibitive for large buildings, an efficient decentralized
approach is developed, based on the Accelerated Distributed Augmented
Lagrangian (ADAL) method [1]. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
method, we first compare it with a centralized method, in which the optimal
solution of a small-scale problem can be obtained. We find that this
decentralized approach can almost approach the optimal solution of the problem.
Further, this decentralized approach is compared with the Distributed
Token-Based Scheduling Strategy (DTBSS) [2]. The numeric results reveal that
when the number of zones is relatively small (less than 20), the two
decentralized methods can achieve a comparable performance regarding the cost
of the HVAC system. However, with an increase of the number of zones in the
building, the proposed decentralized approach demonstrates better performance
with a considerable reduction of the total cost. Moreover, the decentralized
approach proposed in this paper demonstrate better scalability with less

in the transport mechanism when the particle varies from nanoscale to
microscale size comparable to the red blood cell (RBC). The effect of
microscale particle margination has been investigated by several groups. Also,
the transport of nanoscale particles (NPs) in blood has received considerable
attention in the past. This study attempts to bridge the gap by quantitatively
showing how the transport mechanism varies with particle size from nano- to
microscale. Using a three-dimensional (3D) multiscale method, the dispersion of
particles in microscale tubular flows is investigated for various hematocrits,
vessel diameters and particle sizes. NPs exhibit a nonuniform,
smoothly-dispersed distribution across the tube radius due to severe Brownian
motion. The near-wall concentration of NPs can be moderately enhanced by
increasing hematocrit and confinement. Moreover, there exists a critical
particle size ($\sim$1 $\mu$m) that leads to excessive retention of particles
in the cell-free region near the wall, i.e., margination. Above this threshold,
the margination propensity increases with the particle size. The dominance of
RBC-enhanced shear-induced diffusivity (RESID) over Brownian diffusivity (BD)
results in 10 times higher radial diffusion rates in the RBC-laden region
compared to that in the cell-free layer, correlated with the high margination
propensity of microscale particles. This work captures the particle
size-dependent transition from Brownian-motion dominant dispersion to
margination using a unified 3D multiscale computational approach, and
highlights the linkage between the radial distribution of RESID and the
margination of particles in confined blood flows.

of classes of non-bandlimited continuous signals that have a small number of
free parameters, such as a stream of Diracs. The task of reconstructing FRI
signals from discrete samples is often transformed into a spectral estimation
problem and solved using Prony's method and matrix pencil method which involve
estimating signal subspaces. They achieve an optimal performance given by the
Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound yet break down at a certain peak signal-to-noise ratio
(PSNR). This is probably due to the so-called subspace swap event. In this
paper, we aim to alleviate the subspace swap problem and investigate
alternative approaches including directly estimating FRI parameters using deep
neural networks and utilising deep neural networks as denoisers to reduce the
noise in the samples. Simulations show significant improvements on the
breakdown PSNR over existing FRI methods, which still outperform learning-based
approaches in medium to high PSNR regimes.

coated fuel particles is the understanding of the diffusion of fission products
through SiC. Among the elements produced inside the uranium kernel, it has been
suggested that Pd might enhance the diffusion of other fission products. In
this work we have studied the interaction between Pd and SiC. We have observed
that as Pd diffuses it can change the chemical composition and microstructure
of SiC. Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) analysis showed that Pd
increased the amount of high angle grain boundaries from 47 to 59%.
Furthermore, we have observed that as Pd diffused, it changed the composition
of SiC by leaving a trail of excess carbon at the grain boundary. This change
in localized chemical composition and microstructure suggests a grain boundary
complexion transition induced by Pd and a new way in which Pd can lead to
faster diffusion routes for other fission products.

UV radiation, even in the range of 28-74 uW/cm2 of irradiance up to 120 h of
exposure, can induce important changes in the structure of graphene oxide, by
eliminating -OH and C=O functional groups. This reduction affected the
stability of graphene oxide in water by decreasing its zeta potential from 41
to 37 mV with the increase of the exposure time. Our results showed that after
24 h of UV exposure, As(III) adsorption capacity decreased from 5 mg/g to 4.7
mg/g, however after 48 h of irradiation the adsorption increased with time,
reaching 5.1 mg/g at 120 h under 74 uW/cm2 of irradiation. Computer modelling
showed that even a degraded GO structure can have an interaction energy of 53
kcal/mol with H3AsO3. Furthermore, we observed that despite clear changes in
surface composition and particle size, the reduction of graphene oxide
maintained a high degree of cytotoxicity since cell viability decreased to 60%
with a 50 ug/ml dose; except for the sample irradiated at 74 uW/cm2 for five

show that As(III) adsorption, primarily H3AsO3, by graphene oxide is dependent
on its degree of oxidation. Variations in the concentration of potassium
permanganate resulted in an increase on the C/O ratio from 1.98 to 1.35 with
C-OH and C-O-C concentrations of 18 and 32%, respectively. Three oxidation
degrees were studied, the less oxidized material reached a maximum As(III)
adsorption capacity of 124 mg/g, whereas the graphene with the highest degree
of oxidation reached a value of 288 mg/g at pH 7, to the authors knowledge, the
highest reported in the literature. The interaction between graphene oxide and
As(III) was also studied by Density Functional Theory (DFT) computer models
showing that graphene oxide interacts with As(III) primarily through hydrogen
bonds, having interaction energies with the hydroxyl and epoxide groups of 378

transmission spectrum of taper-coupled microbubbles contains closely spaced
modes due to the relatively large radii and oblate geometry of microbubbles. In
this letter, we develop an optical add-drop filter using a microbubble coupled
to fiber taper and angle-polished fiber waveguides. Because of the extra degree
of freedom in the angle of its polish surface, the angle-polished fiber can be
used for the discriminatory excitation of certain radial-order modes in the
optical microcavity, reducing the high modal density and enhancing add-drop
selectivity. Our robust and tunable add-drop filter demonstrated a drop
efficiency of 85.9% and quality factor of 2 x 10^7, corresponding to a
linewidth of 9.68 MHz. As a proof of concept, the drop frequency was tuned
using internal aerostatic pressure at a rate of 7.3 +/- 0.2 GHz/bar with no
diminishing effects on the add-drop filter performance.

spectators. Esports games generate massive amounts of telemetry data. Using
these to predict the outcome of esports matches has received considerable
attention, but micro-predictions, which seek to predict events inside a match,
is as yet unknown territory. Micro-predictions are however of perennial
interest across esports commentators and audience, because they provide the
ability to observe events that might otherwise be missed: esports games are
highly complex with fast-moving action where the balance of a game can change
in the span of seconds, and where events can happen in multiple areas of the
playing field at the same time. Such events can happen rapidly, and it is easy
for commentators and viewers alike to miss an event and only observe the
following impact of events. In Dota 2, a player hero being killed by the
opposing team is a key event of interest to commentators and audience. We
present a deep learning network with shared weights which provides accurate
death predictions within a five-second window. The network is trained on a vast
selection of Dota 2 gameplay features and professional/semi-professional level
match dataset. Even though death events are rare within a game (1\% of the
data), the model achieves 0.377 precision with 0.725 recall on test data when
prompted to predict which of any of the 10 players of either team will die
within 5 seconds. An example of the system applied to a Dota 2 match is
presented. This model enables real-time micro-predictions of kills in Dota 2,
one of the most played esports titles in the world, giving commentators and
viewers time to move their attention to these key events.
