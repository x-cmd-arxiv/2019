cryo-electron microscopy, we consider the multi-target detection model, where
multiple copies of a target signal occur at unknown locations in a long
measurement, further corrupted by additive Gaussian noise. At low noise levels,
one can easily detect the signal occurrences and estimate the signal by
averaging. However, in the presence of high noise, which is the focus of this
paper, detection is impossible. Here, we propose two
approaches---autocorrelation analysis and an approximate expectation
maximization algorithm---to reconstruct the signal without the need to detect
signal occurrences in the measurement. In particular, our methods apply to an
arbitrary spacing distribution of signal occurrences. We demonstrate
reconstructions with synthetic data and empirically show that the sample
complexity of both methods scales as 1/SNR^3 in the low SNR regime.

manipulators in warehouse and manufacturing environments. This has motivated
many efforts on optimizing manipulation tasks involving a single arm.
Coordinating multiple arms for manipulation, however, introduces additional
computational challenges arising from the increased DoFs, as well as the
combinatorial increase in the available operations that many manipulators can
perform, including handoffs between arms. The focus here is on the case of
pick-and-place tasks, which require a sequence of handoffs to be executed, so
as to achieve computational efficiency, asymptotic optimality and practical
anytime performance. The paper leverages recent advances in multi-robot motion
planning for high DoF systems to propose a novel multi-modal extension of the
dRRT* algorithm. The key insight is that, instead of naively solving a sequence
of motion planning problems, it is computationally advantageous to directly
explore the composite space of the integrated multi-arm task and motion
planning problem, given input sets of possible pick and handoff configurations.
Asymptotic optimality guarantees are possible by sampling additional picks and
handoffs over time. The evaluation shows that the approach finds initial
solutions fast and improves their quality over time. It also succeeds in
finding solutions to harder problem instances relative to alternatives and can
scale effectively as the number of robots increases.

  Extensions",,,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Message logging protocols are enablers of local rollback, a more efficient
alternative to global rollback, for fault tolerant MPI applications. Until now,
message logging MPI implementations have incurred the overheads of a redesign
and redeployment of an MPI library, as well as continued performance penalties
across various kernels. Successful research efforts for message logging
implementations do exist, but not a single one of them can be easily deployed
today by more than a few experts. In contrast, in this work we build efficient
message logging capabilities on top of an MPI library with no message logging
capabilities; we do so for two different HPC kernels, one with a global
exchange pattern (CG), and one with a neighbourhood exchange pattern (LULESH).
While our library of choice ULFM detects failure and recovers MPI
communicators, we build on that to then restore the intra- and inter-process
data consistency of both applications. This task turns out to be challenging,
and we present the methodology for doing so in this work. In the end, we
achieve message logging capabilities for each kernel, without the need for an
actual message logging runtime underneath. On the performance side, we match
state-of-the-art solutions and (a) eliminate event logging and the event logger
component altogether, and (b) design a hybrid protocol, which gracefully shifts
between global and local rollback, depending on the available payload logging
memory. Such a hybrid protocol between local and global rollback has not been
previously proposed to our knowledge. Our extensions span a few hundred lines
of code for each kernel, are open-sourced, and enable local and global rollback
after process failure.

However, it comes with its own technical challenges relating to resource

adoption of convolutional neural networks methods, the accuracy of semantic
segmentation algorithms could easily surpass 80% if a robust dataset is

model to survey a new city that is not included in the training set
significantly decreases the accuracy. This is due to the domain shift between
the source dataset on which the model is trained and the new target domain of
the new city images. In this paper, we address this issue and consider the

expressed in terms of the average maximum $\mathbb{E}[M_c(n)]$ of a single

precise asymptotic behavior of both $\Phi_c(n)$ and $S_c(n)$ analytically for
large $n$ in the two problems, for any value of $1<\mu\leq 2$ and $c \in

Electronic Health Records (EHR), are becoming readily available. This provides
an unprecedented opportunity for knowledge discovery and data mining algorithms
to dig insights from them, which can, later on, be helpful to the improvement
of the quality of care delivery. Predictive modeling of clinical risk,
including in-hospital mortality, hospital readmission, chronic disease onset,
condition exacerbation, etc., from patient EHR, is one of the health data
analytic problems that attract most of the interests. The reason is not only
because the problem is important in clinical settings, but also there are
challenges working with EHR such as sparsity, irregularity, temporality, etc.
Different from applications in other domains such as computer vision and
natural language processing, the labeled data samples in medicine (patients)
are relatively limited, which creates lots of troubles for effective predictive
model learning, especially for complicated models such as deep learning. In
this paper, we propose MetaPred, a meta-learning for clinical risk prediction
from longitudinal patient EHRs. In particular, in order to predict the target
risk where there are limited data samples, we train a meta-learner from a set
of related risk prediction tasks which learns how a good predictor is learned.
The meta-learned can then be directly used in target risk prediction, and the
limited available samples can be used for further fine-tuning the model
performance. The effectiveness of MetaPred is tested on a real patient EHR
repository from Oregon Health & Science University. We are able to demonstrate
that with CNN and RNN as base predictors, MetaPred can achieve much better
performance for predicting target risk with low resources comparing with the
predictor trained on the limited samples available for this risk.

failure probabilities across temperatures in ferritic steels. The framework has
the capability to estimate the three statistical parameters present in the

gradient plasticity and conventional J2 plasticity. Moreover, local probability
maps show that potential damage initiation sites are much closer to the crack
tip in the case of gradient-enhanced plasticity. Finally, the fracture response
across the ductile-to-brittle regime is investigated by computing the cleavage
resistance curves with increasing temperature. Gradient plasticity predictions

  Asymmetric Liutex/Rortex",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vortex has been considered as the building block and muscle of turbulence for
long time. A new physical quantity called Liutex (previously named Rortex) has
been defined as the rigid rotation part of fluid motion. From DNS and
experiment, forest of hairpin vortices has been found in flow transition and
low Reynolds turbulence, but more and more one leg vortices appear in fully
developed turbulence. This letter shows hairpin vortex is unstable. Hairpin
vortex will weaken or lose one leg by the shear and vortex interaction. This
conclusion is made by Liutex definition and mathematical analysis without any
physical assumptions. The asymmetry of vortex is caused by the interaction of
symmetric shear and symmetric Liutex due to the definition of Liutex, which
considers the smaller element of a pair of vorticity elements as the rotational
strength. For a 2-D fluid rotation, if a disturbance shear effects the larger
element, the rotation strength will not be changed, but if the disturbance
shear effects the smaller element, the rotation strength will be immediate
changed due to the Liutex strength definition. For a rigid rotation, if both
vorticity of the shear and Liutex have the same directions, e.g., clockwise,
the Liutex strength will not be changed. If the vorticity of the shear and
Liutex have different directions, e.g., one clockwise and one counterclockwise,
the Liutex strength will be weakened. Then, the hairpin vortex could lose the
symmetry and even deform to a one leg vortex. The one leg vortex cannot keep

molecular line spectra, although the strength of different species and
transitions varies from source to source. In contrast, the warm cores do not
show significant molecular line emission. Multiple methanol transitions are
detected toward nine of the hot cores; eight of these had enough transitions to
use the rotation diagram method to estimate rotational temperatures and column
densities. The temperatures lie in the range 104$-$168 K and column densities
from $3\times10^{16}$ to $7\times10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. Using the average methanol

we establish improvement guarantees for a wide class of parametric policies,
generalizing existing results on Gaussian policies. This, together with novel

characterized and compared to the flow field obtained for an axisymmetric

particular the emergence of a strong isotropic radial flow field in the planes
parallel to the wall. These fundamental differences stress the critical impact
of confinement on the flow field around the swimming droplet. We then propose
an analytical formulation, based on a reduced order description of the swimming

communicates with a receiver over a noisy channel. The goal is to realize
timely delivery of fresh data over time, which is assessed by an
age-of-information (AoI) metric. Channel coding is used to combat the channel
errors, and feedback is sent to acknowledge updates' reception. In case
decoding is unsuccessful, a hybrid ARQ protocol is employed, in which
incremental redundancy (IR) bits are transmitted to enhance the decoding
ability. This continues for some amount of time in case decoding remains
unsuccessful, after which a new (fresh) status update is transmitted instead.
In case decoding is successful, the transmitter has the option to idly wait for
a certain amount of time before sending a new update. A general problem is
formulated that optimizes the codeword and IR lengths for each update, and the
waiting times, such that the long term average AoI is minimized. Stationary
deterministic policies are investigated, in which the codeword and IR lengths
are fixed for each update, and the waiting time is a deterministic function of
the AoI. The optimal waiting policy is then derived, and is shown to have a
threshold structure, in which the transmitter sends a new update only if the
AoI grows above a certain threshold that is a function of the codeword and IR
lengths. Choosing the codeword and IR lengths is discussed in the context of
binary symmetric channels.

body, SMPL, and attempt to regress the model parameters that give rise to a
mesh consistent with image evidence. This parameter regression has been a very
challenging task, with model-based approaches underperforming compared to
nonparametric solutions in terms of pose estimation. In our work, we propose to
relax this heavy reliance on the model's parameter space. We still retain the
topology of the SMPL template mesh, but instead of predicting model parameters,
we directly regress the 3D location of the mesh vertices. This is a heavy task
for a typical network, but our key insight is that the regression becomes
significantly easier using a Graph-CNN. This architecture allows us to
explicitly encode the template mesh structure within the network and leverage
the spatial locality the mesh has to offer. Image-based features are attached
to the mesh vertices and the Graph-CNN is responsible to process them on the
mesh structure, while the regression target for each vertex is its 3D location.
Having recovered the complete 3D geometry of the mesh, if we still require a
specific model parametrization, this can be reliably regressed from the
vertices locations. We demonstrate the flexibility and the effectiveness of our
proposed graph-based mesh regression by attaching different types of features
on the mesh vertices. In all cases, we outperform the comparable baselines
relying on model parameter regression, while we also achieve state-of-the-art
results among model-based pose estimation approaches.

resolved CO line emission, the masses of HD 163296, AS 209, and TW Hya are
roughly 3, 115, and 40 times more massive than estimates from CO respectively.
This range indicates that CO depletion is not uniform across different disks
and that dust is a more robust tracer of total disk mass. Our method of
determining surface density using dust lines is robust even if particles form
as aggregates and is useful even in the presence of dust substructure caused by
pressure traps. The low Toomre-Q values observed in this sample indicate that
at least some disks do not accrete efficiently.

highly correlated eigenvalues and level statistics that coincide with those

dip below the saturation point of the survival probability's time evolution. In
this work, we study the correlation hole in the spin-boson (Dicke) model, which
presents a chaotic regime and can be realized in experiments with ultracold
atoms and ion traps. We derive an analytical expression that describes the
entire evolution of the survival probability and allows us to determine the
timescales of its relaxation to equilibrium. This expression shows remarkable
agreement with our numerical results. While the initial decay and the time to
reach the minimum of the correlation hole depend on the initial state, the
dynamics beyond the hole up to equilibration is universal. We find that the
relaxation time of the survival probability for the Dicke model increases
linearly with system size.

compared against a set of six possible drivers of the trends. We find that
velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) - or, equivalently gravitational potential - is
the dominant driver of the chemical composition gradients. Surface mass density
is also correlated with the trends, especially with stellar age. The decrease
of $\nabla$[Mg/Fe] with increasing $\sigma$ is contrasted by a rather shallow
dependence of $\nabla$[Z/H] with $\sigma$ (although this radial gradient is
overall rather steep). This result, along with a shallow age slope at the
massive end, imposes stringent constraints on the progenitors of the
populations that contribute to the formation of the outer envelopes of ETGs.
The SAMI sample is split between a 'field' sample and a cluster sample. Only
weak environment-related differences are found, most notably a stronger
dependence of central total metallicity ([Z/H]$_{e4}$) with $\sigma$, along
with a marginal trend of $\nabla$[Z/H] to steepen in cluster galaxies, a result

with the Lorentz force, since both mechanisms contribute to the Hall voltage.
In this work, we present a channel geometry that allows us to uniquely
distinguish these two contributions and derive, for the first time, their
functional dependency on all external parameters. We show that the ratio of the
Hall viscous to the Lorentz force contribution is negative and that its modulus
decreases with increasing width, slip-length and carrier density, while it
increases with the electron-electron mean free path of our channel. In typical
materials such as GaAs the Hall viscous contribution can dominate the Lorentz
signal up to a few tens of millitesla until the total Hall voltage vanishes and
subsequently is overcome by the Lorentz contribution. Moreover, we prove that
the total Hall electric field is parabolic due to Lorentz effects, whereas the
offset of this parabola is characterized by the Hall viscosity. Hence, our

insurance companies and their contribution to systemic risk in the insurance
sector. Our main goal is to analyze the conditional structure of the
correlation on the European insurance market and to compare systemic risk in
different regimes of this market. These regimes are identified by monitoring
the weekly rates of returns of eight of the largest insurers (five from Europe
and the biggest insurers from the USA, Canada and China) during the period
January 2005 to December 2018. To this aim we use statistical clustering
methods for time units (weeks) to which we assigned the conditional variances
obtained from the estimated copula-DCC-GARCH model. The advantage of such an
approach is that there is no need to assume a priori a number of market
regimes, since this number has been identified by means of clustering quality
validation. In each of the identified market regimes we determined the commonly
now used CoVaR systemic risk measure. From the performed analysis we conclude
that all the considered insurance companies are positively correlated and this
correlation is stronger in times of turbulences on global markets which shows
an increased exposure of the European insurance sector to systemic risk during
crisis. Moreover, in times of turbulences on global markets the value level of
the CoVaR systemic risk index is much higher than in ""normal conditions"".

network architectures against simpler convolutional neural network
architectures, in reproducing the classifications into the classes of
unresolved, FRI and FRII morphologies. We utilise images from a LOFAR survey
which is the deepest, wide-area radio survey to date, revealing more complex
radio-source structures compared to previous surveys, presenting further
challenges for machine learning algorithms. The 4- and 8-layer convolutional
networks attain an average precision of 93.3% and 94.3% respectively, compared
to 89.7% obtained with the capsule network, when training on original and
augmented images. Implementing transfer learning achieves a precision of 94.4%,
that is within the confidence interval of the 8-layer convolutional network.
The convolutional networks always outperform any variation of the capsule
network, as they prove to be more robust to the presence of noise in images.
The use of pooling appears to allow more freedom for the intra-class
variability of radio galaxy morphologies, as well as reducing the impact of

processed to produce a time series of sensor measurements (e.g., filterbank
outputs). This time series encodes semantic information in a speaker-dependent
way. An earlier paper showed how to use the sequence of sensor measurements to
derive an ""inner"" time series that is unaffected by any previous invertible
transformation of the sensor measurements. The current paper considers two or
more speakers, who mimic one another in the following sense: when they say the
same words, they produce sensor states that are invertibly mapped onto one
another. It follows that the inner time series of their utterances must be the
same when they say the same words. In other words, the inner time series
encodes their speech in a manner that is speaker-independent. Consequently, the
ASR training process can be simplified by collecting and labelling the inner
time series of the utterances of just one speaker, instead of training on the
sensor time series of the utterances of a large variety of speakers. A similar
argument suggests that the inner time series of music is
instrument-independent. This is demonstrated in experiments on monophonic
electronic music.

however, its effectiveness is determined by the expressivity of the utilized
variational distributions in terms of their ability to match the true posterior
distribution. In turn, the expressivity of the variational family is largely
limited by the requirement of having a tractable density function. To overcome
this roadblock, we introduce a new family of variational upper bounds on a
marginal log density in the case of hierarchical models (also known as latent
variable models). We then give an upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler
divergence and derive a family of increasingly tighter variational lower bounds
on the otherwise intractable standard evidence lower bound for hierarchical
variational distributions, enabling the use of more expressive approximate
posteriors. We show that previously known methods, such as Hierarchical
Variational Models, Semi-Implicit Variational Inference and Doubly
Semi-Implicit Variational Inference can be seen as special cases of the
proposed approach, and empirically demonstrate superior performance of the
proposed method in a set of experiments.

onto a hardware graph of limited connectivity. If the maximum degree of the

minor embedding in which each logical qubit is mapped to a tree of physical

ferromagnetic with some coupling strength $F<0$. Here we address the question
of what value $F$ should take in order to maximise the probability that the
annealer finds the correct ground-state of an Ising problem. The sum of $|F|$
for each logical qubit is defined as minor embedding energy. We confirm
experimentally that the ground-state probability is maximised when the minor
embedding energy is minimised, subject to the constraint that no domain walls
appear in every tree of physical qubits associated with each embedded logical
qubit. We further develop an analytical lower bound on $|F|$ which satisfies
this constraint and show that it is a tighter bound than that previously

stronger perturbations beyond linear response, the quantum system relaxes to

evaluation of the centrality of vertices and edges in the network. Several

namely centrality descends from the local or global connectivity structure of
the network. However, vertices can exhibit their own intrinsic relevance
independent from topology; e.g., vertices representing strategic locations
(e.g., hospitals, water and energy sources, etc.) or institutional roles (e.g.,
presidents, agencies, etc.). In these cases, the connectivity network structure
and vertex intrinsic relevance mutually concur to define the centrality of
vertices and edges. The purpose of this work is to embed the information about
the intrinsic relevance of vertices into CNT tools to enhance the network
analysis. We focus on the degree, closeness and betweenness metrics, being

longstanding open question. The difficulty stems from projection effects
meaning one must rely on statistical methods applied to galaxy samples to infer
intrinsic shape distributions. Theoretical work using analytical galaxy
potentials suggests a relationship between galaxy intrinsic shape (as defined
by its ""triaxiality"", in practice a proxy for how prolate a galaxy is) and the
intrinsic misalignment angle between kinematic and morphological axes
($\Psi_{\rm int}$). This relationship reduces the number of unknowns, providing
more reliable inferred intrinsic shape distributions than methods using
photometry alone. Here we explore the connection between intrinsic shape and
stellar kinematics using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the
Illustris project. The strongest relationship we find is that galaxy intrinsic
flattening is correlated with specific angular momentum (j) with high j
galaxies being flatter than galaxies with low specific angular momentum. Our
analysis shows that, although the majority of kinematically misaligned galaxies
exhibit prolate shapes, examples of kinematically aligned prolate galaxies are
also present. Clearly a direct correspondence between prolate shape and
minor-axis rotation (often referred to as ""prolate rotation"") is not present in
Illustris. Thus, we demonstrate that the assumption of a simple relationship
between $\Psi_{\rm int}$ and intrinsic shape commonly employed in shape
recovery studies is not valid for Illustris galaxies. We suggest improvements

larger decision making strategy aimed at making cohort selection as just,
quantitative, transparent, and accountable as possible. We suggest this
algorithm be embedded in a two-step selection procedure. First, all application
materials are stripped of markers of identity that could induce conscious or
sub-conscious bias. During blind review, the committee selects all applicants,
submissions, or other entities that meet their merit-based criteria. This often
yields a cohort larger than the admissible number. In the second stage, the
target cohort can be chosen from this meritorious pool via a new algorithm and
software tool. Entrofy optimizes differences across an assignable set of
categories selected by the human committee. Criteria could include gender,
academic discipline, experience with certain technologies, or other
quantifiable characteristics. The Entrofy algorithm yields the computational
maximization of diversity by solving the tie-breaking problem with provable
performance guarantees. We show how Entrofy selects cohorts according to
pre-determined characteristics in simulated sets of applications and
demonstrate its use in a case study. This cohort selection process allows human
judgment to prevail when assessing merit, but assigns the assessment of
diversity to a computational process less likely to be beset by human bias.
Importantly, the stage at which diversity assessments occur is fully
transparent and auditable with Entrofy. Splitting merit and diversity
considerations into their own assessment stages makes it easier to explain why
a given candidate was selected or rejected.

Eulerian approach. The Eulerian definition of the flux is composed of a

convolutional long short-term memory networks and time-dilated convolution
stacks inspired by the recent success of time-domain enhancement networks like
ConvTasNet. For the latter architecture, we also propose novel modifications
that further improve separation performance. In terms of the framewise
analysis-synthesis basis, we explore both a short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
and a learnable basis, as used in ConvTasNet. For both of these bases, we also
examine the effect of window size. In particular, for STFTs, we find that
longer windows (25-50 ms) work best for speech/non-speech separation, while
shorter windows (2.5 ms) work best for arbitrary sounds. For learnable bases,
shorter windows (2.5 ms) work best on all tasks. Surprisingly, for universal
sound separation, STFTs outperform learnable bases. Our best methods produce an
improvement in scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio of over 13 dB for
speech/non-speech separation and close to 10 dB for universal sound separation.

Luminosities have been inferred from stellar apparent magnitudes and used in

There appears to be a population of very young targets with ages of less than 2

No significant evidence is found for differences with metallicity in the
stellar rotational velocities of early-type stars, although the targets in the
SMC may rotate faster than those in young Galactic clusters. The rotational
velocity distribution for single non-supergiant B-type stars is inferred and
implies that a significant number have low rotational velocity ($\simeq$10\%

  Engine for Image Retrieval",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image retrieval utilizes image descriptors to retrieve the most similar
images to a given query image. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is becoming
the dominant approach to extract image descriptors for image retrieval. For
low-power hardware implementation of image retrieval, the drawback of CNN-based
feature descriptor is that it requires hundreds of megabytes of storage. To
address this problem, this paper applies deep model quantization and
compression to CNN in ASIC chip for image retrieval. It is demonstrated that
the CNN-based features descriptor can be extracted using as few as 2-bit
weights quantization to deliver a similar performance as floating-point model
for image retrieval. In addition, to implement CNN in ASIC, especially for
large scale images, the limited buffer size of chips should be considered. To
retrieve large scale images, we propose an improved pooling strategy, region
nested invariance pooling (RNIP), which uses cropped sub-images for CNN.
Testing results on chip show that integrating RNIP with the proposed 2-bit CNN
model compression approach is capable of retrieving large scale images.

recently been cleared for primary diagnosis in the US. A conventional WSI
system scans the tissue slide to different positions and acquires the digital
images. In a typical implementation, a focus map is created prior to the
scanning process, leading to significant overhead time and a necessity for high
positional accuracy of the mechanical system. The resulting cost of WSI system
is often prohibitive for frozen section procedure during surgery.
  Methods: We report a novel WSI scheme based on a programmable LED array for
sample illumination. In between two regular brightfield image acquisitions, we
acquire one additional image by turning on a red and a green LED for color
multiplexed illumination. We then identify the translational shift of the red-
and green-channel images by maximizing the image mutual information or
cross-correlation. The resulting translational shift is used for dynamic focus
correction in the scanning process. Since we track the differential focus
during adjacent acquisitions, there is no positional repeatability requirement
in our scheme.
  Results: We demonstrate a prototype WSI platform with a mean focusing error
of ~0.3 microns. Different from previous implementations, this prototype
platform requires no focus map surveying, no secondary camera or additional
optics, and allows for continuous sample motion in the focus tracking process.
  Conclusions: A programmable LED array can be used for color-multiplexed
single-shot autofocusing in WSI. The reported scheme may enable the development
of cost-effective WSI platforms without positional repeatability requirement.
It may also provide a turnkey solution for other high-content microscopy
applications.

The proposed tool gives the possibility to automatically define a dynamic

central role in various glass anomalies, yet it is neither fully characterized,
nor fully understood. Of particular importance is the scaling of the
attenuation rate $\Gamma(k)$ with small wavenumbers $k\!\to\!0$ in the
thermodynamic limit of macroscopic glasses. Here we use a combination of theory
and extensive computer simulations to show that the macroscopic low-frequency
behavior emerges at intermediate frequencies in finite-size glasses, above a
recently identified crossover wavenumber $k_\dagger$, where phonons are no
longer quantized into bands. For $k\!<\!k_\dagger$, finite-size effects
dominate $\Gamma(k)$, which is quantitatively described by a theory of
disordered phonon bands. For $k\!>\!k_\dagger$, we find that $\Gamma(k)$ is
affected by the number of quasilocalized nonphononic excitations, a generic
signature of glasses that feature a universal density of states. In particular,
we show that in a frequency range in which this number is small, $\Gamma(k)$
follows a Rayleigh scattering scaling $\sim\!k^{d+1}$ ($d$ is the spatial
dimension), and that in a frequency range in which this number is sufficiently
large, the recently observed generalized-Rayleigh scaling of the form
$\sim\!k^{d+1}\log\!{(k_0/k)}$ emerges ($k_0\!>k_\dagger$ is a characteristic
wavenumber). Our results suggest that macroscopic glasses --- and, in
particular, glasses generated by conventional laboratory quenches that are
known to strongly suppress quasilocalized nonphononic excitations --- exhibit
Rayleigh scaling at the lowest wavenumbers $k$ and a crossover to
generalized-Rayleigh scaling at higher $k$. Some supporting experimental
evidence from recent literature is presented.

extensive attention in various subdomains of algorithmics. In the area of
kernelization, it is known that this problem is unlikely to have efficient
preprocessing algorithms, also known as polynomial kernelizations. However, it
has been shown in a recent work of Lokshtanov et al. [STOC 2017] that if one
considered an appropriate notion of approximate kernelization, then this
problem parameterized by the solution size does admit an approximate polynomial
kernelization. In fact, Lokhtanov et al. were able to obtain a polynomial size
approximate kernelization scheme (PSAKS) for Connected Vertex Cover
parameterized by the solution size. A PSAKS is essentially a preprocessing
algorithm whose error can be made arbitrarily close to 0. In this paper we
revisit this problem, and consider parameters that are strictly smaller than
the size of the solution and obtain the first polynomial size approximate

performed on informative instances as much as possible. We prove that the
proposed technique outperforms vanilla SGD with existing importance sampling
approaches for linear SVM problems, and establish an O(1/k) convergence for
strongly convex problems. In order to apply the proposed techniques to
accelerate training of deep models, we propose to jointly train a very
lightweight Assistant network in addition to the original deep network referred
to as Boss. The Assistant network is designed to gauge the importance of a
given instance with respect to the current Boss such that a shrinking operation
can be applied in the batch generator. With careful design, we train the Boss
and Assistant in a nonblocking and asynchronous fashion such that overhead is
minimal. We demonstrate that AutoAssist reduces the number of epochs by 40% for
training a ResNet to reach the same test accuracy on an image classification
data set and saves 30% training time needed for a transformer model to yield
the same BLEU scores on a translation dataset.

characterise the new source, ULX-4, which is only detected in the joint

variations across the disk. We find that observed variations in brightness
temperature with latitude can be explained by variations in the H$_2$S profile
that range from sub- to super-saturations at altitudes above the 10-bar
pressure level, while variations in CH$_4$ improve the quality of fit near the
equator. At the south polar cap, our best fit model has a depleted deep
atmospheric abundance of H$_2$S from 30 to only 1.5 times the protosolar value,
while simultaneously depleting the CH$_4$ abundance. This pattern of
enhancement and depletion of condensable species is consistent with a global
circulation structure where enriched air rises at the mid-latitudes

grown as a serious issue in Online Social Networks. Recently, researchers have
created automated machine learning algorithms to detect Cyberbullying using
social and textual features. However, the very algorithms that are intended to
fight off one threat (cyberbullying) may inadvertently be falling prey to
another important threat (bias of the automatic detection algorithms). This is
exacerbated by the fact that while the current literature on algorithmic
fairness has multiple empirical results, metrics, and algorithms for countering
bias across immediately observable demographic characteristics (e.g. age, race,
gender), there have been no efforts at empirically quantifying the variation in
algorithmic performance based on the network role or position of individuals.
We audit an existing cyberbullying algorithm using Twitter data for disparity
in detection performance based on the network centrality of the potential
victim and then demonstrate how this disparity can be countered using an
Equalized Odds post-processing technique. The results pave way for more
accurate and fair cyberbullying detection algorithms.

systems are investigated, where the adjustable convergence speed is discussed.
This paper firstly proposes a novel adaptive guaranteed-performance consensus
protocol, where the communication weights can be adaptively regulated. By the
state space decomposition method and the stability theory, sufficient
conditions for guaranteed-performance consensus are obtained, as well as the
guaranteed-performance cost. Moreover, since the convergence speed is usually
adjusted by changing the algebraic connectivity in existing works, which
increases the communication burden and the load of the controller, and the
system topology is always given in practical applications, the lower bound of
the convergence coefficient for multi-agent systems with the adaptive
guaranteed-performance consensus protocol is deduced, which is linearly
adjustable approximately by changing the adaptive control gain. Finally,
simulation examples are introduced to demonstrate theoretical results.

accurate classifiers. However, there are situations when data is scarce and

computational models which typically take days to run, thus hindering the
potential of machine learning tools. In this work, we present a novel
classifier that takes advantage of lower fidelity models and inexpensive
approximations to predict the binary output of expensive computer simulations.
We postulate an autoregressive model between the different levels of fidelity
with Gaussian process priors. We adopt a fully Bayesian treatment for the
hyper-parameters and use Markov Chain Mont Carlo samplers. We take advantage of
the probabilistic nature of the classifier to implement active learning
strategies. We also introduce a sparse approximation to enhance the ability of
themulti-fidelity classifier to handle large datasets. We test these
multi-fidelity classifiers against their single-fidelity counterpart with
synthetic data, showing a median computational cost reduction of 23% for a
target accuracy of 90%. In an application to cardiac electrophysiology, the
multi-fidelity classifier achieves an F1 score, the harmonic mean of precision

both are trained with 50 samples. In general, our results show that the

that neglect of surface terms is not necessarily justified, especially owing to
possible nontrivial topological configuration of the gluon field in the QCD

topology would bring about a delta-function type singularity at zero Bjorken
variable into the longitudinally polarized gluon distribution function, thereby
invalidating a naive partonic sum rule for the total nucleon spin. In the
present paper, we carefully examine the role of surface terms in the nucleon
spin decomposition problem. We shall argue that surface terms do not prevent us
from obtaining a physically meaningful decomposition of the nucleon spin. In
particular, we demonstrate that nontrivial topology of the gluon field would
not bring about a delta-function type singularity into the longitudinally

results in an energy-dependent rotation of the polarization vector of linearly
polarized emission from astrophysical sources. It is believed that if the
relative rotation angle ($\Delta\Theta$) of the polarization vector of high
energy photons with respect to that of low energy photons is larger than
$\pi/2$, then the net polarization of the signal would be significantly
depleted and could not be as high as the observed level. Hence, the measurement
of high polarization implies that $\Delta\Theta$ should not be too large. In
this work, we assemble recent detections of prompt emission polarization in
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), all of whom have high detection significance.
Following the method shown in Lin et al. (2016), we give a detailed calculation
on the polarization evolution arising from the LIV effect for each GRB, and
confirm that, even if $\Delta\Theta$ is approaching to $\pi/2$, the net
polarization is not severely suppressed, and more than 60\% of the initial
polarization can be conserved. Applying this method to our GRB polarimetric
data, we improve existing sensitivities to LIV involving photons by factors
ranging from two to ten. In addition, we prove that our constraints are not
greatly affected by uncertainties in the spectral parameters of GRBs.

to data from the deployment camera network during training in order to perform
well. This is because contemporary \reid{} models trained on one dataset do not
generalise to other camera networks due to the domain-shift between datasets.
This requirement is often the bottleneck for deploying \reid{} systems in
practical security or commercial applications, as it may be impossible to
collect this data in advance or prohibitively costly to annotate it. This paper
alleviates this issue by proposing a simple baseline for domain
generalizable~(DG) person re-identification. That is, to learn a \reid{} model
from a set of source domains that is suitable for application to unseen
datasets out-of-the-box, without any model updating. Specifically, we observe
that the domain discrepancy in \reid{} is due to style and content variance
across datasets and demonstrate appropriate Instance and Feature Normalization
alleviates much of the resulting domain-shift in Deep \reid{} models. Instance
Normalization~(IN) in early layers filters out style statistic variations and
Feature Normalization~(FN) in deep layers is able to further eliminate
disparity in content statistics. Compared to contemporary alternatives, this
approach is extremely simple to implement, while being faster to train and
test, thus making it an extremely valuable baseline for implementing \reid{} in

models. Due to complex dependencies among variables in realistic model, finding
an exact solution for MAP inference is often intractable. Thus, many
approximation methods have been developed, among which the linear programming
(LP) relaxation based methods show promising performance. However, one major
drawback of LP relaxation is that it is possible to give fractional solutions.
Instead of presenting a tighter relaxation, in this work we propose a
continuous but equivalent reformulation of the original MAP inference problem,
called LS-LP. We add the L2-sphere constraint onto the original LP relaxation,
leading to an intersected space with the local marginal polytope that is
equivalent to the space of all valid integer label configurations. Thus, LS-LP
is equivalent to the original MAP inference problem. We propose a perturbed
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to optimize the
LS-LP problem, by adding a sufficiently small perturbation epsilon onto the
objective function and constraints. We prove that the perturbed ADMM algorithm
globally converges to the epsilon-Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (epsilon-KKT) point of the
LS-LP problem. The convergence rate will also be analyzed. Experiments on
several benchmark datasets from Probabilistic Inference Challenge (PIC 2011)

to the deep convolutional neural networks which can harvest powerful features
for images. In particular, state-of-the-art salient object detection methods
enjoy high accuracy and efficiency from fully convolutional network (FCN) based
frameworks which are trained from end to end and predict pixel-wise labels.
However, such framework suffers from adversarial attacks which confuse neural
networks via adding quasi-imperceptible noises to input images without changing
the ground truth annotated by human subjects. To our knowledge, this paper is
the first one that mounts successful adversarial attacks on salient object
detection models and verifies that adversarial samples are effective on a wide
range of existing methods. Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end
trainable framework to enhance the robustness for arbitrary FCN-based salient
object detection models against adversarial attacks. The proposed framework
adopts a novel idea that first introduces some new generic noise to destroy
adversarial perturbations, and then learns to predict saliency maps for input
images with the introduced noise. Specifically, our proposed method consists of
a segment-wise shielding component, which preserves boundaries and destroys
delicate adversarial noise patterns and a context-aware restoration component,
which refines saliency maps through global contrast modeling. Experimental
results suggest that our proposed framework improves the performance
significantly for state-of-the-art models on a series of datasets.

First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), to minimize mean response time we must use
Shortest-Remaining-Processing-Time (SRPT) scheduling at the servers. Much less

traditional dispatching policies that are used in practice in systems with FCFS
servers often have poor performance in systems with SRPT servers. In this
paper, we devise a simple fix that can be applied to any dispatching policy.
This fix, called guardrails, ensures that the dispatching policy yields optimal

Any dispatching policy, when augmented with guardrails, becomes heavy-traffic

architecture for lung nodule detection. The CNN architecture in the first stage
is based on the improved UNet segmentation network to establish an initial
detection of lung nodules. Simultaneously, in order to obtain a high recall
rate without introducing excessive false positive nodules, we propose a novel
sampling strategy, and use the offline hard mining idea for training and
prediction according to the proposed cascaded prediction method. The CNN
architecture in the second stage is based on the proposed dual pooling
structure, which is built into three 3D CNN classification networks for false
positive reduction. Since the network training requires a significant amount of
training data, we adopt a data augmentation method based on random mask.
Furthermore, we have improved the generalization ability of the false positive
reduction model by means of ensemble learning. The proposed method has been
experimentally verified on the LUNA dataset. Experimental results show that the
proposed TSCNN architecture can obtain competitive detection performance.

Income Countries (LMICs) has been recognised as a major barrier to providing
quality cancer care in these regions, along with a shortfall in the number of
highly qualified personnel. It is expected that additional challenges will be
faced in operating precise, high tech radiotherapy equipment in these
environments, and anecdotal evidence suggests that LINACs have greater downtime
and higher failure rates of components than their counterparts in High-Income
Countries. To guide future developments such as the design of a LINAC tailored
for use in LMIC environments, it is important to take a data-driven approach to
any re-engineering of the technology. However, no detailed statistical data on
LINAC downtime and failure modes has been previously collected or presented in
the literature. This work presents the first known comparative analysis of
failure modes and downtime of current generation LINACs in radiotherapy
centres, with the aim of determining any correlations between LINAC environment
and performance. Logbooks kept by radiotherapy personnel on the operation of
their LINAC were obtained and analysed from centres in Oxford (UK), Abuja,
Benin, Enugu, Lagos, Sokoto (Nigeria) and Gaborone (Botswana). By
deconstructing the LINAC into 12 different subsystems, it is found that the
vacuum subsystem only fails in the LMIC centres and the failure rate in an LMIC
environment is more than twice as large in 6 of the 12 subsystems compared to
the High Income Country (HIC). Additionally, it is shown that despite
accounting for only 3.4% of total number of faults, the LINAC faults which take
more than an hour to repair account for 74.6% of the total downtime. The
results of this study inform future attempts to mitigate the problems affecting
LINACs in LMIC environments.

The
transient was detected in early 2015 as part of a two-year survey of M81 made
up of 12 epochs using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. While undetected on
2014 September 12, the source was first detected on 2015 January 2, from which
point it remained visible at an approximately constant luminosity of $L_{R} =
1.5 \pm 0.1 \times 10^{24}$erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ at the observing frequency of
6 GHz for at least 2 months. Assuming this is a synchrotron event with a
rise-time between 2.6 and 112 days, the peak luminosity (at equipartition)
corresponds to a minimum energy of $10^{44} \lesssim E_{min} \lesssim
10^{46}$erg and jet power of $P_{min} \sim 10^{39}$erg s$^{-1}$, which are
higher than most known X-ray binaries. Given its longevity, lack of short-term
radio variability, and the absence of any multi-wavelength counterpart (X-ray
luminosity $L_{X} \lesssim 10^{36}$erg s$^{-1}$), it does not behave like known
Galactic or extragalactic X-ray binaries. The M81 transient radio properties
more closely resemble the unidentified radio transient 43.78+59.3 discovered in
M82, which has been suggested to be a radio nebula associated with an accreting
source similar to SS 433. One possibility is that both the new M81 transient
and the M82 transient may be the birth of a short-lived radio bubble associated
with a discrete accretion event similar to those observed from the ULX Holmberg
II X-1. However, it is not possible to rule out other identifications including
long-term supernova shockwave interactions with the surrounding medium from a
faint supernova or a background active galaxy.

and the Ca II K intensity for a variety of surface features as a function of
the position on the disc and the solar activity level. This relationship can be
used to recover the unsigned photospheric magnetic field from images recorded
in the core of Ca II K line. We have analysed 131 pairs of high-quality,
full-disc, near-co-temporal observations from SDO/HMI and Rome/PSPT spanning
half a solar cycle. To analytically describe the observationally-determined
relation, we considered three different functions: a power law with an offset,
a logarithmic function, and a power law function of the logarithm of the
magnetic flux density. We used the obtained relations to reconstruct maps of
the line-of-sight component of the unsigned magnetic field (unsigned
magnetograms) from Ca II K observations, which were then compared to the
original magnetograms. We find that both power-law functions represent the data
well, while the logarithmic function is good only for quiet periods. We see no
significant variation over the solar cycle or over the disc in the derived fit
parameters, independently of the function used. We find that errors in the
independent variable, usually not accounted for, introduce attenuation bias. To
address this, we binned the data with respect to the magnetic field strength
and Ca II K contrast separately and derived the relation for the bisector of
the two binned curves. The reconstructed unsigned magnetograms show good
agreement with the original ones. RMS differences are less than 90 G. The
results were unaffected by the stray-light correction of the SDO/HMI and
Rome/PSPT data. Our results imply that Ca~II~K observations, accurately
processed and calibrated, can be used to reconstruct unsigned magnetograms by
using the relations derived in our study.

attention. It adopts a multi-stage attacks mode which can be concluded as a
combination of virtual attacks and real attacks. Under the cover of virtual
attacks, real attacks can achieve the real purpose of the attacker, as a
result, it often caused huge losses inadvertently. However, to our knowledge,
all previous works use common methods such as Causal-Correlation or Cased-based
to detect outdated multi-stage attacks. Few attentions have been paid to detect
the ""Feint Attack"", because the difficulty of detection lies in the
diversification of the concept of ""Feint Attack"" and the lack of professional
datasets, many detection methods ignore the semantic relationship in the
attack. Aiming at the existing challenge, this paper explores a new method to
solve the problem. In the attack scenario, the fuzzy clustering method based on
attribute similarity is used to mine multi-stage attack chains. Then we use a
few-shot deep learning algorithm (SMOTE&CNN-SVM) and bidirectional Recurrent
Neural Network model (Bi-RNN) to obtain the ""Feint Attack"" chains. ""Feint
Attack"" is simulated by the real attack inserted in the normal causal attack
chain, and the addition of the real attack destroys the causal relationship of
the original attack chain. So we used Bi-RNN coding to obtain the hidden
feature of ""Feint Attack"" chain. In the end, our method achieved the goal to
detect the ""Feint Attack"" accurately by using the LLDoS1.0 and LLDoS2.0 of
DARPA2000 and CICIDS2017 of Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity.

their collective dynamics exhibit interesting topological behavior. The system
undergoes dynamical topological phase transition at its global periods if its
dispersion relation is strictly linear and when all of the bosonic mode are
properly displaced from their equilibrium position. We corroborate the
occurrence of dynamical phase transition by calculating Fisher zeros of the
Loschmidt amplitude for sudden quench dynamics. A connection is established
between the order of nonanalycity in the accumulated geometric phase and the
spectral density of the system. Furthermore, it is shown that a power law
scaling holds at all critical times for various displacement spectra, whose
dynamical exponent equals unity. Eventually, a scheme for the quantum
simulation of such dynamical phase transition is proposed. The scheme is based
on the vibrational spectrum of a free-standing membrane of a two-dimensional
material. To induce a displacement in the system and for tracking its
collective geometrical dynamics, we propose to employ a spin that properly
couples to the modes. When appropriate geometrical and boundary conditions are
applied to the membrane, a spectrum with linear dispersion is attainable, then
decoherence dynamics of the spin unveils occurrence of a dynamical topological
phase transition.

transients in the data from the second observing run of Advanced LIGO and
Advanced Virgo. We search for gravitational-wave transients with a duration of
milliseconds to approximately one second in the 32-4096 Hz frequency band with
minimal assumptions about the signal properties, thus targeting a wide variety
of sources. We also perform a matched-filter search for gravitational-wave
transients from cosmic string cusps for which the waveform is well-modeled. The
unmodeled search detected gravitational waves from several binary black hole
mergers which have been identified by previous analyses. No other significant
events have been found by either the unmodeled search or the cosmic string
search. We thus present search sensitivity for a variety of signal waveforms
and report upper limits on the source rate-density as function of the
characteristic frequency of the signal. These upper limits are a factor of
three lower than the first observing run, with a $50\%$ detection probability
for gravitational-wave emissions with energies of $\sim10^{-9}M_\odot c^2$ at
153 Hz. For the search dedicated to cosmic string cusps we consider several
loop distribution models, and present updated constraints from the same search
done in the first observing run.

(Fe{1-x}Cox)3GeTe2 with x=0-0.78 were successfully synthesized and
characterized with x-ray diffraction, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and
magnetization measurements. Both the Curie-Weiss temperature and ferromagnetic
(FM) ordered moment of Fe3GeTe2 are gradually suppressed upon Co doping. A kink
in zero-field-cooling low field M(T) curve which is previously explained as an
antiferromagnetic transition is observed for samples with x=0-0.58. Our
detailed magnetization measurements and theoretical calculations strongly
suggest that this kink is originated from the pinning of magnetic domain walls.
The domain pinning effects are suddenly enhanced when the doping concentration
of cobalt is around 50%, both the coercive field Hc and the magnetic remanence
to saturated magnetization ratio MR/MS are largely improved and a hard magnetic
phase emerges in bulk single crystal samples. The strong doping dependent
magnetic properties suggest more spintronic applications of Fe3GeTe2.

the characteristics of three different kinds of citations, this paper borrows
musical vocabulary and names them solo citations (SC), duet citations (DC), and
prelude citations (PC) respectively. Studying how to measure the disruption of
a published work effectively, this study analyzes nine indicators and suggests
a general evaluation formula. Seven of the nine indicators are innovations
introduced by this paper: SC, SC-DC, SC-PC, SC-DC-PC, (SC-DC)/(SC+DC),
(SC-PC)/(SC+DC), and (SC-DC-PC)/(SC+DC), as is the general formula. These
indices are discussed considering two cases: One case concerns the Citation
Indexes for Science and the other concerns Co-citations. The results show that,
compared with other indicators, four indicators (SC, SC-DC, SC/(SC+DC), and
(SC-DC)/(SC+DC)) are logically and empirically reasonable. Future research may
consider combining these indices, for example, using SC multiplied by
SC/(SC+DC) or SC-DC multiplied by (SC-DC)/(SC+DC), to get final evaluation
results that contain desirable characteristics of two types of indicators.
Confirming which of the evaluation results from these indicators can best
reflect the innovation of research papers requires much empirical analysis.

for large-scale similarity search. Particularly, deep hashing methods have
greatly improved the search performance under supervised scenarios. In
contrast, unsupervised deep hashing models can hardly achieve satisfactory
performance due to the lack of reliable supervisory similarity signals. To
address this issue, we propose a novel deep unsupervised hashing model, dubbed
DistillHash, which can learn a distilled data set consisted of data pairs,
which have confidence similarity signals. Specifically, we investigate the
relationship between the initial noisy similarity signals learned from local
structures and the semantic similarity labels assigned by a Bayes optimal
classifier. We show that under a mild assumption, some data pairs, of which
labels are consistent with those assigned by the Bayes optimal classifier, can
be potentially distilled. Inspired by this fact, we design a simple yet
effective strategy to distill data pairs automatically and further adopt a
Bayesian learning framework to learn hash functions from the distilled data
set. Extensive experimental results on three widely used benchmark datasets
show that the proposed DistillHash consistently accomplishes the
state-of-the-art search performance.

  Information","Accepted by CVPR 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-person pose estimation is an important but challenging problem in
computer vision. Although current approaches have achieved significant progress
by fusing the multi-scale feature maps, they pay little attention to enhancing
the channel-wise and spatial information of the feature maps. In this paper, we
propose two novel modules to perform the enhancement of the information for the
multi-person pose estimation. First, a Channel Shuffle Module (CSM) is proposed
to adopt the channel shuffle operation on the feature maps with different
levels, promoting cross-channel information communication among the pyramid
feature maps. Second, a Spatial, Channel-wise Attention Residual Bottleneck
(SCARB) is designed to boost the original residual unit with attention
mechanism, adaptively highlighting the information of the feature maps both in
the spatial and channel-wise context. The effectiveness of our proposed modules
is evaluated on the COCO keypoint benchmark, and experimental results show that
our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results.

  HIV-infected individuals","16 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: The use of cumulative measures of exposure to raised HIV viral load
(viremia copy-years) is an increasingly common in HIV prevention and treatment
epidemiology due to the high biological plausibility. We sought to estimate the
magnitude and direction of bias in a cumulative measure of viremia caused by
different frequency of sampling and duration of follow-up.
  Methods: We simulated longitudinal viral load measures and reanalysed cohort
study datasets with longitudinal viral load measurements under different
sampling strategies to estimate cumulative viremia.
  Results: In both simulated and observed data, estimates of cumulative viremia
by the trapezoidal rule show systematic upward bias when there are fewer
sampling time points and/or increased duration between sampling time points,
compared to estimation of full time series. Absolute values of cumulative
viremia vary appreciably by the patterns of viral load over time, even after
adjustment for total duration of follow up.
  Conclusions: Sampling bias due to differential frequency of sampling appears
extensive and of meaningful magnitude in measures of cumulative viremia.
Cumulative measures of viremia should be used only in studies with sufficient
frequency of viral load measures and always as relative measures.

feedforward passivity. First, an input-feedforward-passivity-based
continuous-time distributed algorithm is proposed. It is shown that the error
system of the proposed algorithm can be decomposed into a group of individual
input feedforward passive (IFP) systems that interact with each other using
output feedback information. Based on this IFP framework, convergence
conditions of a suitable coupling gain are derived over weight-balanced and
uniformly jointly strongly connected (UJSC) topologies. It is also shown that
the IFP-based algorithm converges exponentially when the topology is strongly
connected. Second, a novel distributed derivative feedback algorithm is
proposed based on the passivation of IFP systems. While most works on directed
topologies require knowledge of eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian, the
derivative feedback algorithm is fully distributed, namely, it is robust
against randomly changing weight-balanced digraphs with any positive coupling
gain and without knowing any global information. Finally, numerical examples
are presented to illustrate the proposed distributed algorithms.

thermal noise, in a mixed line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) environment.
We develop analytical expressions for the probability of false alarm and the
probability of detection of a drone, which quantify the impact of aggregate

detection performance of individual sensors. We also provide analytical
expressions for the average network probability of detection, which capture the

the critical sensor density that maximizes the average network probability of

of dimension $2n-1$, which is only assumed to be weakly pseudoconvex. Let
$\Box_b$ be the $\overline{\partial}_b$-Laplacian. Eigenvalue estimate of
$\Box_b$ is a fundamental issue both in CR geometry and analysis. In this
paper, we are able to obtain a sharp estimate of the number of eigenvalues
smaller than or equal to $\lambda$ of $\Box_b$ acting on the $m$-th Fourier
components of smooth $(n-1,q)$-forms on $X$, where $m\in \mathbb{Z}_+$ and
$q=0,1,\cdots, n-1$. Here the sharp means the growth order with respect to $m$
is sharp. In particular, when $\lambda=0$, we obtain the asymptotic estimate of
the growth for $m$-th Fourier components $H^{n-1,q}_{b,m}(X)$ of
$H^{n-1,q}_b(X)$ as $m \rightarrow +\infty$. Furthermore, we establish a Serre
type duality theorem for Fourier components of Kohn-Rossi cohomology which is
of independent interest. As a byproduct, the asymptotic growth of the
dimensions of the Fourier components $H^{0,q}_{b,-m}(X)$ for $ m\in

estimate for $\lambda=0$ already improves very much the corresponding estimate
of Hsiao and Li . We also give appilcations of our main results, including
Morse type inequalities, asymptotic Riemann-Roch type theorem,
Grauert-Riemenscheider type criterion, and an orbifold version of our main

cylinder and become open for a twisted magnetic field. Therefore, magnetars may
have a large polar cap, which may correspond to the hot spot during outburst.
Particle flow in the open field line regions will result in the untwisting of
the magnetic field. Magnetic energy release in the open field line regions can
be calculated. The model calculations can catch the general trend of magnetar
outburst: decreasing X-ray luminosity, shrinking hot spot etc. For magnetic

which a router determines the next-hop of each packet in the queue to get it as
quickly as possible to its destination. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been
introduced to design autonomous packet routing policies with local information
of stochastic packet arrival and service. However, the curse of dimensionality
of RL prohibits the more comprehensive representation of dynamic network
states, thus limiting its potential benefit. In this paper, we propose a novel
packet routing framework based on \emph{multi-agent} deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) in which each router possess an \emph{independent} LSTM
recurrent neural network for training and decision making in a \emph{fully
distributed} environment. The LSTM recurrent neural network extracts routing
features from rich information regarding backlogged packets and past actions,
and effectively approximates the value function of Q-learning. We further allow
each route to communicate periodically with direct neighbors so that a broader
view of network state can be incorporated. Experimental results manifest that
our multi-agent DRL policy can strike the delicate balance between
congestion-aware and shortest routes, and significantly reduce the packet
delivery time in general network topologies compared with its counterparts.

the misalignment model, in which the primordial $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry is
broken during inflation and the $f(R)$ gravity is described by the $R^2$ model,
and in addition, the non-minimal coupling has the form $\sim
h(\phi)R^{\gamma}$, with $0<\gamma<0.75$. By appropriately constraining the
non-minimal coupling at early times, the axion field remains frozen in its
primordial vacuum expectation value, and the $R^2$ gravity dominates the
inflationary era. As the Universe expands, when $H$ equals the axion mass $m_a$
and for cosmic times for which $m_a\gg H$, the axion field oscillates. By
assuming a slowly varying evolution of the axion field, the axion energy
density scales as $\rho_a\sim a^{-3}$, where $a$ is the scale factor,
regardless of the background Hubble rate, thus behaving as cold dark matter. At
late times, the axion still evolves as $\rho_a\sim a^{-3}$, however the Hubble
rate of the expansion and thus the dynamical evolution of the Universe is
controlled by terms containing the higher derivatives of $\sim R^{\gamma}$,
which are related to the non-minimal coupling, and as we demonstrate, the
resulting solution of the Friedman equation at late times is an approximate de
Sitter evolution. The late-time de Sitter Hubble rate scales as $H\sim
\Lambda^{1/2}$, where $\Lambda$ is an integration constant of the theory, which
has its allowed values very close to the current value of the cosmological
constant. Finally, the theory has a prediction for the existence of a
pre-inflationary primordial stiff era, in which the energy density of the axion
scales as $\rho_a\sim a^{-6}$.

transport. Solitons could come from the relaxation of the strained CDW within
an elastic-to-plastic transition. However, the nucleation process and the
transport of these charged topological objects have never been observed at the

micro-diffraction with micrometer resolution of a NbSe$_3$ sample designed to
have sliding and non-sliding areas. Direct imaging of the charge density wave
deformation is obtained using an analytical approach based on the phase
gradient to disentangle the transverse from the longitudinal components over a
large surface of a hundred microns size. We show that the CDW dissociates
itself from the host lattice in the sliding regime and displays a large
transverse deformation, ten times larger than the longitudinal one and strongly
dependent on the amplitude and the direction of the applied currents. This
deformation continuously extends across the macroscopic sample dimensions, over
a distance 10 000 times greater than the CDW wavelength despite the presence of
strong defects while remaining strongly pinned by the lateral surfaces. This 2D
quantitative study highlights the prominent role of shear effect that should
play a significant role in the nucleation of solitons.

$m=3780(7)$ MeV and coupling $g=16.0(^{+2.1}_{-0.2})$ (related to the width),
both consistent with their experimental values. The vector $\psi(2S)$ appears

remains a resonance. We stress that all quoted uncertainties are only
statistical, while lattice spacing effects and the approach to the physical

determine the latitudinal and vertical distribution of cloud opacity and
methane abundance in Neptune's observable troposphere (0.1 - ~3 bar). Previous
observations at these wavelengths in 2003 by HST/STIS (Karkoschka and Tomasko
2011, Icarus 205, 674-694) found that the mole fraction of methane above the
cloud tops (at ~2 bar) varied from ~4% at equatorial latitudes to ~2% at
southern polar latitudes, by comparing the observed reflectivity at wavelengths
near 825 nm controlled primarily by either methane absorption or H2-H2/H2-He
collision-induced absorption. We find a similar variation in cloud-top methane
abundance in 2018, which suggests that this depletion of methane towards
Neptune's pole is potentially a long-lived feature, indicative of long-term
upwelling at mid-equatorial latitudes and subsidence near the poles. By
analysing these MUSE observations along the central meridian with a retrieval
model, we demonstrate that a broad boundary between the nominal and depleted
methane abundances occurs at between 20 - 40S. We also find a small depletion
of methane near the equator, perhaps indicating subsidence there, and a local
enhancement near 60 - 70S, which we suggest may be associated with South Polar
Features (SPFs) seen in Neptune's atmosphere at these latitudes. Finally, by
the use of both a reflectivity analysis and a principal component analysis, we
demonstrate that this depletion of methane towards the pole is apparent at all
locations on Neptune's disc, and not just along its central meridian.

three-way handshake induces significant delay overhead. The TCP Fast Open (TFO)

handshakes for all TCP handshakes that follow a full initial handshake to the
same host. However, this comes at the cost of privacy limitations and also has
some performance limitations. In this paper, we investigate the TFP deployment

analysis further reveals significant privacy problems of the protocol design

to track the online activities of users. As a countermeasure, we introduce a
novel protocol called TCP Fast Open Privacy (FOP). TCP FOP prevents tracking by
network attackers and impedes third-party tracking, while still allowing 0-RTT

in order for the weak error of the Euler approximation to converge uniformly in
time and clarify relations between the validity of Lyapunov conditions, i) and
ii).
  Conditions for ii) to hold are studied in the literature. Here we produce
sufficient conditions for i) to hold. The study of derivative estimates has
attracted a lot of attention, however not many results are known in order to
guarantee exponentially fast decay of the derivatives. Exponential decay of
derivatives typically follows from coercive-type conditions involving the
vector fields appearing in the equation and their commutators; here we focus on
the case in which such coercive-type conditions are non-uniform in space. To
the best of our knowledge, this situation is unexplored in the literature, at
least on a systematic level. To obtain results under such space-inhomogeneous
conditions we initiate a pathwise approach to the study of derivative estimates
for diffusion semigroups and combine this pathwise method with the use of Large
Deviation Principles.

simple yet typical candidate file selection schemes for cache-enabled fog user

the harmful interference among the concurrent transmissions of F-UEs, a
multicast-based opportunistic content delivery strategy is proposed by
exploring the idea of opportunistic spectrum access (OSA). Assuming
decentralized probabilistic caching, we first derive the activation probability
of the F-UEs. Then, by adopting an appropriate approximation, the cache-hit
probability, the coverage probability, and thereby the successful content
delivery probability (SCDP) of the F-D2D network are evaluated. We also develop
an iterative algorithm based on the gradient projection method to obtain a
suboptimal caching policy for the maximization of SCDP. Extensive simulation

socio-economic surveys. The purpose of this paper is to propose a completely
design-based estimation strategy that accounts for both problems without
resorting to models but simply performing a two-step calibration. The first
calibration exploits a set of auxiliary variables only available for the units
in the sampled population to account for nonresponse. The second calibration
exploits a different set of auxiliary variables available for the whole
population, to account for under-coverage. The two calibrations are then
unified in a double-calibration estimator. Mean and variance of the estimator
are derived up to the first order of approximation. Conditions ensuring
approximate unbiasedness are derived and discussed. The strategy is empirically
checked by a simulation study performed on a set of artificial populations. A
case study is lead on Danish data coming from the European Union Statistics on
Income and Living Conditions survey. The strategy proposed is flexible and
suitable in most situations in which both under-coverage and nonresponse are
present.

nickel oxide (NiO) and show that the widely used model of free small polaron
hopping, initially raised to characterize transport in high-purity samples, is
not appropriate for modeling intrinsically doped NiO. Instead, we present
extensive evidence, collected by means of temperature- and frequency-dependent
measurements of the electrical conductivity $\sigma$, that the model of
polaronic inter-acceptor hopping can be used to consistently explain the
electronic conduction process. In this framework, holes are localized to
acceptors (Ni vacancies), forming a strongly bound, polaron-like state. They
can only move through the film by hopping to a neighboring, at least partially
unoccupied, acceptor. This renders the spatial overlap between neighboring
polaronic wave functions a highly critical parameter. The signature of this
process is the occurrence of two temperature regions of the DC conductivity,
separated by about half the Debye temperature $\theta_D/2 \approx 200 K$. For
$T > \theta_D/2$, holes are transferred by phonon-assisted hopping over the
potential barrier between two sites, whereas phonon-assisted tunneling through
the barrier dominates below that temperature. We also show that the degree of
structural and electronic disorder plays a vital role in determining the
characteristics of the transport process: high disorder leads to strong
energetic broadening of the acceptor states such that hopping to more distant
sites may be favored over transfer to nearest neighbors (variable range
hopping). The assumption of high binding energies of the charge carriers at VNi
is in accordance with the recent paradigm shift regarding the understanding of
the electronic structure of NiO: holes doped into NiO couple to Ni 3d spins,
thereby occupying deep polaron-like states within the band gap (Zhang-Rice
bound doublets).

causes strong magneto-electric coupling and distinguishes them from the
conventional type-I multiferroics. However, their therein polarization is too
small because the ferroelectricity is merely a derivative from the magnetic
order. Here we report a new class of multiferroic materials, monolayer VOX2 (X
= Cl, Br, and I), which combine the advantages of type-I and type-II
multiferroics. Both ferroelectricity and magnetism arise from the same V
cation, where the filled d-orbital is perpendicular to an a priori
ferroelectric polarization and thus poses no hindrance to ferroelectricity,
indicating a violation of the usual d0 rule. This makes the combination of
large polarizations and strong magneto-electric coupling possible. Our findings
not only add new ferromagnetic-ferroelectric multiferroics, but also point to a
unique mechanism to engineer multiferroics.

fields due to getting rid of the limitation of handcrafted representations.
However, most previous image retargeting algorithms still employ fixed design
principles such as using gradient map or handcrafted features to compute
saliency map, which inevitably restricts its generality. Deep learning
techniques may help to address this issue, but the challenging problem is that
we need to build a large-scale image retargeting dataset for the training of
deep retargeting models. However, building such a dataset requires huge human
efforts.
  In this paper, we propose a novel deep cyclic image retargeting approach,
called Cycle-IR, to firstly implement image retargeting with a single deep
model, without relying on any explicit user annotations. Our idea is built on
the reverse mapping from the retargeted images to the given input images. If
the retargeted image has serious distortion or excessive loss of important
visual information, the reverse mapping is unlikely to restore the input image
well. We constrain this forward-reverse consistency by introducing a cyclic
perception coherence loss. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective image
retargeting network (IRNet) to implement the image retargeting process. Our
IRNet contains a spatial and channel attention layer, which is able to
discriminate visually important regions of input images effectively, especially
in cluttered images. Given arbitrary sizes of input images and desired aspect
ratios, our Cycle-IR can produce visually pleasing target images directly.
Extensive experiments on the standard RetargetMe dataset show the superiority
of our Cycle-IR. In addition, our Cycle-IR outperforms the Multiop method and
obtains the best result in the user study. Code is available at

rapid quantification of tissue relaxation times. However, it is prone to
blurring due to off-resonance effects. Hence, fat blurring into adjacent
regions might prevent identification of small tumors by their quantitative T1
and T2 values. This study aims to correct for the blurring artifacts, thereby
enabling fast quantitative mapping in the female breast.
  METHODS: The impact of fat blurring on spiral MRF results was first assessed
by simulations. Then, MRF was combined with 3-point Dixon water-fat separation
and spiral blurring correction based on conjugate phase reconstruction. The
approach was assessed in phantom experiments and compared to Cartesian
reference measurements, namely inversion recovery (IR), multi-echo spin echo
(MESE) and Cartesian MRF, by normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and
standard deviation (STD) calculations. Feasibility is further demonstrated
in-vivo for quantitative breast measurements of 6 healthy female volunteers,
age range 24-31 years.
  RESULTS: In the phantom experiment, the blurring correction reduced the NRMSE
per phantom vial on average from 16% to 8% for T1 and from 18% to 11% for T2
when comparing spiral MRF to IR/MESE sequences. When comparing to Cartesian
MRF, the NRMSE reduced from 15% to 8% for T1 and from 12% to 7% for T2.
Furthermore, STDs decreased. In-vivo, the blurring correction removed fat bias
on T1/T2 from a rim of about 7-8 mm width adjacent to fatty structures.
  CONCLUSION: The blurring correction for spiral MRF yields improved
quantitative maps in the presence of water and fat.

analytical solutions of acoustic and Alfv\'en wave propagation in uniform

propagate with an Alfv\'en speed of the charged fluid only, while the

propagate with the sound speed corresponding to either the charges or the
neutrals, while the perturbation in the other fluid component is very small.
Otherwise, when the collision frequency is similar to the real part of the wave
frequency, the interaction between charges and neutrals through momentum

(CPD) in reality, since the planet is still surrounded by a disk at this
evolutionary stage. Yet, no comprehensive CPD modeling was done in
near-infrared wavelengths, where high contrast imaging is a powerful tool to
detect these objects. We combined 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations of
various embedded planets with RADMC-3D radiative transfer post-processing that
includes scattering of photons on dust particles. We made synthetic images for
VLT NaCo/ERIS in the Ks, L', M' bands as well as examined the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of disks between 1 $\mu m$ and 10 cm. We found that the
observed magnitudes from the planet's vicinity will mostly depend on the CPD
parameters, not on the planet's. The CPD is 20-100x brighter than the embedded
planet in near-IR. We also show how the CPD parameters, e.g. the dust-to-gas
ratio will affect the resulting CPD magnitudes. According to the SEDs, the best
contrast ratio between the CPD and circumstellar disks is in sub-mm/radio
wavelengths and between 8-33 microns in case if the planet opened a resolvable,
deep gap ($\ge 5 \rm{M_{Jup}}$), while the contrast is particularly poor in the
near-IR. Hence, to detect the forming planet and its CPD, the best chance today
is targeting the sub-mm/radio wavelengths and the 10-micron silicate feature
vicinity. In order to estimate the forming planet's mass from the observed
brightness, it is necessary to run system specific disk modeling.

quanta in current-biased superconductor films placed in a perpendicular
magnetic field can lose stability due to a decrease in the vortex viscosity
coefficient $\eta$ with increasing velocity of the vortices $v$. The dependence
of $\eta$ on $v$ leads to a $nonlinear$ section in the current-voltage
($I$-$V$) curve which ends at the flux-flow instability point with a voltage
jump to a highly resistive state. At the same time, in contradistinction with
the nonlinear conductivity regime, instability jumps often occur in $linear$
$I$-$V$ sections. Here, for the elucidation of such jumps we develop a theory
of local instability of the magnetic flux flow occurring not in the entire film
but in a narrow strip across the film width in which vortices move much faster
than outside it. The predictions of the developed theory are in agreement with
experiments on Nb films for which the heat removal coefficients and the
inelastic scattering times of quasiparticles are deduced. The presented model
of local instability is also relevant for the characterization of
superconducting thin films whose performance is examined for fast single-photon

The mass-size distributions of the clumps and the presence of massive young

the overabundance of YSOs and clumps on the rim suggest that the collect and

real-time detection information (alerts) from multiple sources (collaborative

collaboration exist, real-world adoption of such collaborative security

TRIDEnT, a novel collaborative platform that aims to enable and incentivize
parties to exchange network alert data, thus increasing their overall detection

to selectively advertise, sell and acquire security alerts in the form of

The ferromagnetic correlations can be qualitatively explained by a simple

TD-DFT study on the interaction of a 4 keV proton with an isolated DNA base
pair was carried out. Ehrenfest dynamics was used to study the evolution of the
system during and after the proton impact up to about 193 fs. This time was
long enough to observe the dissociation of the target, which occurs between
80-100 fs. The effect of base pair linking to the DNA double helix was emulated
by fixing the four O3' atoms responsible for the attachment. The base pair
tends to dissociate into its main components, namely the phosphate groups,
sugars and nitrogenous bases. A central impact with energy transfer of 17.9 eV
only produces base damage while keeping the backbone intact. An impact on a
phosphate group with energy transfer of about 60 eV leads to backbone break at
that site together with base damage, while the opposite backbone site integrity
is kept is this situation. As the whole system is perturbed during such a
collision, no atom remains passive. These results suggest that base damage
accompanies all backbone breaks since hydrogen bonds that keep bases together
are much weaker that those between the other components of the DNA.

importance are how to identify the most vulnerable components and how to devise
a network making the overall system more robust to external perturbations. To
address these two questions, we investigate the response of complex networks of
coupled oscillators to local perturbations. We quantify the magnitude of the
resulting excursion away from the unperturbed synchronous state through
quadratic performance measures in the angle or frequency deviations. We find
that the most fragile oscillators in a given network are identified by
centralities constructed from network resistance distances. Further defining
the global robustness of the system from the average response over ensembles of
homogeneously distributed perturbations, we find that it is given by a family
of topological indices known as generalized Kirchhoff indices. Both resistance
centralities and Kirchhoff indices are obtained from a spectral decomposition
of the stability matrix of the unperturbed dynamics and can be expressed in
terms of resistance distances. We investigate the properties of these
topological indices in small-world and regular networks. In the case of
oscillators with homogeneous inertia and damping coefficients, we find that
inertia only has small effects on robustness of coupled oscillators. Numerical
results illustrate the validity of the theory.

non-terminating system and its environment. In bidding games the players bid
for the right to move the token: in each round, the players simultaneously
submit bids, and the higher bidder moves the token and pays the other player.
Bidding games are known to have a clean and elegant mathematical structure that
relies on the ability of the players to submit arbitrarily small bids. Many
applications, however, require a fixed granularity for the bids, which can
represent, for example, the monetary value expressed in cents. We study, for
the first time, the combination of discrete-bidding and infinite-duration
games. Our most important result proves that these games form a large
determined subclass of concurrent games, where determinacy is the strong
property that there always exists exactly one player who can guarantee winning
the game. In particular, we show that, in contrast to non-discrete bidding
games, the mechanism with which tied bids are resolved plays an important role
in discrete-bidding games. We study several natural tie-breaking mechanisms and
show that, while some do not admit determinacy, most natural mechanisms imply
determinacy for every pair of initial budgets.

  Our second motivation comes from the work of the other two authors on Riesz
$s$-equilibrium problems on finitely many intervals on the real line in the
presence of external fields. They have shown that when the signed equilibrium
measure has concave positive part on every interval, then the $s$-equilibrium

$\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ symmetry. This suggests a specific modification to General
Relativity in which the entire NS-NS sector is promoted to stringy graviton
fields. Imposing off-shell $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ symmetry fixes the correct
couplings to other matter fields and the Einstein field equations are enriched
to comprise $D^{2}+1$ components, dubbed recently as the Einstein Double Field
Equations. Here we explore the cosmological implications of this framework. We
derive the most general homogeneous and isotropic ansatzes for both stringy
graviton fields and the $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$-covariant energy-momentum tensor.
Crucially, the former admits space-filling magnetic $H$-flux. Substituting them
into the Einstein Double Field Equations, we obtain the $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$
completion of the Friedmann equations along with a generalized continuity
equation. We discuss how solutions in this framework may be characterized by
two equation-of-state parameters, $w$ and $\lambda$, where the latter
characterizes the relative intensities of scalar and tensor forces. When
$\lambda+3w=1$, the dilaton remains constant throughout the cosmological
evolution, and one recovers the standard Friedmann equations for generic matter
content (i.e. for any $w$). We further point out that, in contrast to General
Relativity, neither an $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$-symmetric cosmological constant nor a
scalar field with positive energy density gives rise to a de Sitter solution.

beyond our solar system. The estimation of the fundamental parameters of the
transiting exoplanets rely on the accuracy of the theoretical predictions for
radius and effective temperature of the host M-dwarf, hence the importance of
multiple empirical tests of very low-mass star (VLM) models, the theoretical
counterpart of M-dwarfs. Recent determinations of mass, radius and effective
temperature of a sample of M-dwarfs of known metallicity have disclosed a
supposed discontinuity in the effective temperature-radius diagram
corresponding to a stellar mass of about 0.2Mo, that has been ascribed to the
transition from partially convective to fully convective stars. In this paper
we compare existing VLM models to these observations, and find that theory does
not predict any discontinuity at around 0.2Mo, rather a smooth change of slope
of the effective temperature-radius relationship around this mass value. The
appearance of a discontinuity 5is due to naively fitting the empirical data
with linear segments. Also, its origin is unrelated to the transition to fully
convective structures. We find that this feature is instead an empirical
signature for the transition to a regime where electron degeneracy provides an
important contribution to the stellar EOS, and constitutes an additional test
of the consistency of the theoretical framework for VLM models.

kernelization in parameterized complexity, i.e., the study of provable and
efficient preprocessing for NP-hard problems. Motivated by the great variety of
positive and negative results for kernelization for Vertex Cover subject to
different parameters and graph classes, we seek to unify and generalize them
using so-called blocking sets, which have played implicit and explicit roles in
many results.
  We show that in the most-studied setting, parameterized by the size of a
deletion set to a specified graph class $\mathcal{C}$, bounded minimal blocking
set size is necessary but not sufficient to get a polynomial kernelization.
Under mild technical assumptions, bounded minimal blocking set size is showed
to allow an essentially tight efficient reduction in the number of connected
components.
  We then determine the exact maximum size of minimal blocking sets for graphs
of bounded elimination distance to any hereditary class $\mathcal{C}$,
including the case of graphs of bounded treedepth. We get similar but not tight
bounds for certain non-hereditary classes $\mathcal{C}$, including the class
$\mathcal{C}_{LP}$ of graphs where integral and fractional vertex cover size
coincide. These bounds allow us to derive polynomial kernels for Vertex Cover
parameterized by the size of a deletion set to graphs of bounded elimination
distance to, e.g., forest, bipartite, or $\mathcal{C}_{LP}$ graphs.

supported by DNN-based voice activity detection (VAD) followed by
post-filtering. The speaker is targeted through estimating relative transfer
functions between microphones. Each block of the input signals is processed
independently in order to make the method applicable in highly dynamic
environments. Owing to the short length of the processed block, the statistics
required by the beamformer are estimated less precisely. The influence of this
inaccuracy is studied and compared to the processing regime when recordings are
treated as one block (batch processing). The experimental evaluation of the
proposed method is performed on large datasets of CHiME-4 and on another
dataset featuring moving target speaker. The experiments are evaluated in terms
of objective and perceptual criteria (such as signal-to-interference ratio
(SIR) or perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), respectively).
Moreover, word error rate (WER) achieved by a baseline automatic speech
recognition system is evaluated, for which the enhancement method serves as a
front-end solution. The results indicate that the proposed method is robust
with respect to short length of the processed block. Significant improvements
in terms of the criteria and WER are observed even for the block length of 250

devised by Barelli and Couvreur (Asiacrypt 2018) that efficiently recovers the
private key. It shows that DAGS can be totally cryptanalysed by solving a
system of bilinear polynomial equations. However, some sets of DAGS parameters
were not broken in practice. In this paper we improve the algebraic attack by
showing that the original approach was not optimal in terms of the ratio of the
number of equations to the number of variables. Contrary to the common belief
that reducing at any cost the number of variables in a polynomial system is
always beneficial, we actually observed that, provided that the ratio is
increased and up to a threshold, the solving can be heavily improved by adding
variables to the polynomial system. This enables us to recover the private keys
in a few seconds. Furthermore, our experimentations also show that the maximum
degree reached during the computation of the Gr\""obner basis is an important
parameter that explains the efficiency of the attack. Finally, the authors of
DAGS updated the parameters to take into account the algebraic cryptanalysis of
Barelli and Couvreur. In the present article, we propose a hybrid approach that
performs an exhaustive search on some variables and computes a Gr\""obner basis
on the polynomial system involving the remaining variables. We then show that
the updated set of parameters corresponding to 128-bit security can be broken

reproduce singular events appearing in the original. This process is performed
in the time domain, discarding the harmful phase recovery step which usually
concludes synthesis performed in the time-frequency domain. It is also
straightforward and flexible, as it does not require any fine tuning between
several losses when synthesizing diverse sound textures. A way of extending the
synthesis in order to produce a sound of any length is also presented, after
which synthesized spectrograms and sound signals are showcased. We also discuss
on the choice of CNN, on border effects in our synthesized signals and on

other neutrino topics. A prototype is designed and set up for better
understanding sub-systems of future detector. The preliminary results show that
its threshold reaches ~0.3MeV with trigger rate ~290 Hz on the ground with
cosmic muon rate ~35 Hz. Aiming for a better detector understanding from PMT
signal, three reconstruction algorithms are compared for PMT waveforms with
different overshoot ratios, including charge integration, waveform fitting, and
deconvolution. It is concluded that the three methods have similar performance
on uncertainty and systematic bias while deconvolution algorithm is best to
handle larger overshoot and the simplest charge integration could be considered
with controlled overshoot for future fast preliminary reconstruction.

the energy ${\mathcal E}$ of the decay electrons in a muon $g-2$ experiment. We
include both electromagnetic and gravitational effects and we estimate possible
systematics on the measurements of $g-2\equiv 2(1+a)$, whose experimental
uncertainty will soon reach $\Delta a/a\approx 10^{-7}$. In addition to the
standard modulation of ${\mathcal E}$ when the motion is orthogonal to a
constant magnetic field $B$, with angular frequency $\omega_a=e a |B|/m$, we
study effects due to: (1) a non constant muon $\gamma$ factor, in presence of
electric fields $E$, (2) a correction due to a component of the muon velocity
along $B$ (the `pitch correction'), (3) corrections to the precession rate due
to $E$ fields, (4) non-trivial spacetime metrics. Oscillations along the radial
and vertical directions of the muon lead to oscillations in ${\mathcal E}$ with
a relative size of order $10^{-6}$, for the BNL $g-2$ experiment. We then find
a subleading effect in the `pitch' correction, leading to a frequency shift of
$\Delta \omega_a/\omega_a \approx {\cal O}(10^{-9})$ and subleading effects of
about $\Delta \omega_a/\omega_a \approx {\rm few} \times {\cal
O}(10^{-8}-10^{-9})$ due to $E$ fields. Finally we show that GR effects are
dominated by the Coriolis force, due to the Earth rotation with angular
frequency $\omega_T$, leading to a correction of about $\Delta
\omega_a/\omega_a \approx \omega_T/(\gamma \omega_a) \approx {\cal

electron $g-2$ experiments, being of order $\Delta \omega_a/\omega_{a, {\rm

pathologies related to brain development, such as lissencephaly, a genetic
disease which cause a reduction of the number of cerebral sulci. Recent
experiments on brain organoids have confirmed that gyrification, i.e. the
formation of the folded structures of the brain, is triggered by the
inhomo-geneous growth of the peripheral region. However, the rheology of these
cellular aggregates and the mechanics of lissencephaly are still matter of
debate. In this work, we develop a mathematical model of brain organoids based
on the theory of morpho-elasticity. We describe them as non-linear elastic
bodies, composed of a disk surrounded by a growing layer called cortex. The
external boundary is subjected to a tissue surface tension due the
intercellular adhesion forces. We show that the resulting surface energy is
relevant at the small length scales of brain organoids and significantly
affects the mechanics of cellular aggregates. We perform a linear stability
analysis of the radially symmetric configuration and we study the post-buckling
behaviour through finite element simulations. We find that the process of
gyrification is triggered by the cortex growth and modulated by the competition
between two length scales: the radius of the organoid and the capillary length
due to surface tension. We show that a solid model can reproduce the results of
the in-vitro experiments. Furthermore, we prove that the lack of brain sulci in
lissencephaly is caused by a reduction of the cell stiffness: the softening of
the organoid strengthens the role of surface tension, delaying or even
inhibiting the onset of a mechanical instability at the free boundary.

scheme for the BGK model. Classical semi-Lagrangian finite difference schemes,
coupled with an L-stable treatment of the collision term, allow large time
steps, for all the range of Knudsen number. Unfortunately, however, such
schemes are not conservative. There are two main sources of lack of
conservation. First, when using classical continuous Maxwellian, conservation
error is negligible only if velocity space is resolved with sufficiently large
number of grid points. However, for a small number of grids in velocity space
such error is not negligible, because the parameters of the Maxwellian do not
coincide with the discrete moments. Secondly, the non-linear reconstruction
used to prevent oscillations destroys the translation invariance which is at
the basis of the conservation properties of the scheme. As a consequence the
schemes show a wrong shock speed in the limit of small Knudsen number. To treat
the first problem and ensure machine precision conservation of mass, momentum
and energy with a relatively small number of velocity grid points, we replace
the continuous Maxwellian with the discrete Maxwellian introduced by Mieussens.
The second problem is treated by implementing a conservative correction
procedure based on the flux difference form. In this way we can construct a
conservative semi-Lagrangian scheme which is Asymptotic Preserving (AP) for the
underlying Euler limit, as the Knudsen number vanishes. The effectiveness of
the proposed scheme is demonstrated by extensive numerical tests.

$\mathbb{F}_p$ coefficients, and the $\mathbb{Z}/p \mathbb{Z}$-equivariant Tate
Floer cohomology of its $p$-th power $\phi^p.$ The construction involves a
Kaledin-type quasi-Frobenius map, as well as a $\mathbb{Z}/p
\mathbb{Z}$-equivariant pants product: an equivariant operation with $p$ inputs
and $1$ output. Our method of proof involves a spectral sequence for the action
filtration, and a local $\mathbb{Z}/p \mathbb{Z}$-equivariant coproduct
providing an inverse on the $E^2$-page. This strategy has the advantage of
accurately describing the effect of the isomorphism on filtration levels. We
describe applications to the symplectic mapping class group, as well as develop
Smith theory for the persistence module of a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism $\phi$
on symplectically aspherical symplectic manifolds. We illustrate the latter by
giving a new proof of the celebrated no-torsion theorem of Polterovich, and by
relating the growth rate of the number of periodic points of the $p^k$-th
iteration of $\phi$ and its distance to the identity. Along the way, we prove a
sharpening of the classical Smith inequality for actions of $\mathbb{Z}/p
\mathbb{Z}.$

different outcomes from connectedness by individual dispersal, we investigated
chance processes leading to loss of species diversity using a model of a
neutral two-species metacommunity. Two scenarios were investigated: pairwise
coalescence where the communities coalesce in pairs, intermix and then
separate; and diffuse coalescence where several communities mix as a pool and
are re-distributed to their original patches. When standardized for the same
net movement, both types of coalescence led to a longer time to single species
dominance than dispersal. Coalescence therefore may be an important process
contributing to the surprisingly high microbial species diversity in nature.

the ratio $m_K/m$, where $m_K$ is the mass of kaon and $m$ is the averaged mass
of nucleon and $\Lambda$-hyperon. The amplitude is calculated from the
appropriate Feynman diagrams by using the pseudovector theory. The contact

contributes to the process. Here we have investigated the effect of amplitude
expansion on the extraction of the coupling constants $g_{K^+\Lambda p}$ and
$g^V_{K_1^+\Lambda p}$. The last kinematics is the backward region, where we

learning to deep networks but most of them are either designed specific for

suggest data that the target model is likely to produce a wrong prediction.
This method is task-agnostic as networks are learned from a single loss

the time required for multiple scatterings to boost UV photons up to soft and

high-frequency soft lags, but also the clear bumps and wiggles in reverberation

control of the weight matrices and depend exponentially on depth via a product

considered. We suspect that this conundrum comes from the fact that these
bounds depend on the training data only through the margin. In practice, many
data-dependent techniques such as Batchnorm improve the generalization
performance. For feedforward neural nets as well as RNNs, we obtain tighter
Rademacher complexity bounds by considering additional data-dependent

the norms of the Jacobians of each layer with respect to all previous layers.
Our bounds scale polynomially in depth when these empirical quantities are
small, as is usually the case in practice. To obtain these bounds, we develop
general tools for augmenting a sequence of functions to make their composition

provide a programmable wireless environment for physical layer security. By
adjusting the reflecting coefficients, the IRS can change the attenuation and
scattering of the incident electromagnetic wave so that it can propagate in a
desired way toward the intended receiver. Specifically, we consider a downlink
multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast system where the base station

keeps them secret from multiple eavesdroppers. By jointly optimizing the
beamformers at the BS and reflecting coefficients at the IRS, we formulate a
minimum-secrecy-rate maximization problem under various practical constraints
on the reflecting coefficients. The constraints capture the scenarios of both
continuous and discrete reflecting coefficients of the reflecting elements. Due
to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we propose an efficient
algorithm based on the alternating optimization and the path-following
algorithm to solve it in an iterative manner. Besides, we show that the

dwarf and a main-sequence star (WDMS) is a powerful observational constraint on
population synthesis models of the poorly understood common-envelope (CE)
interaction. Models have often struggled to reproduce the small number of
post-CE WDMS binaries with anomalously long orbital periods greater than
$\sim$4 d, though recent studies suggest that in longer period systems
recombination energy may help contribute to the efficient ejection of the CE.
Planetary nebulae (PNe) are an emerging source of rare long period post-CE
binaries which can act as powerful complementary constraints on population
synthesis models to more traditional post-CE binary populations. A tentative
9.0 d orbital period was recently proposed for the central star of the PN
IC~4776, potentially one of the longest periods observed in post-CE WDMS
binaries. Here we present SALT HRS observations of IC~4776 that rule out a 9.0
d orbital period, as well as the previously suggested Wolf-Rayet classification
of the primary. The SALT HRS data establish a 3.11 d orbital period and rule
out Of and Wolf-Rayet primary spectral types. Assuming a mass of 0.6 $M_\odot$
for the primary and an orbital inclination matching the nebula orientation, we
find a companion mass of $0.22\pm0.03$ $M_\odot$, most likely corresponding to
an M4V companion. The orbital period of IC~4776 is still consistent with
findings of abundance discrepancy factor (ADF) studies of post-CE PNe, but any

maintaining a coreset to preserve the minimum enclosing ball (MEB) for a
sliding window of points that are continuously updated in a data stream.
Although the problem has been extensively studied in batch and append-only
streaming settings, no efficient sliding-window solution is available yet. In
this work, we first introduce an algorithm, called AOMEB, to build a coreset
for MEB in an append-only stream. AOMEB improves the practical performance of
the state-of-the-art algorithm while having the same approximation ratio.
Furthermore, using AOMEB as a building block, we propose two novel algorithms,
namely SWMEB and SWMEB+, to maintain coresets for MEB over the sliding window
with constant approximation ratios. The proposed algorithms also support
coresets for MEB in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Finally,
extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that
SWMEB and SWMEB+ achieve speedups of up to four orders of magnitude over the
state-of-the-art batch algorithm while providing coresets for MEB with rather
small errors compared to the optimal ones.

analytical study based on a first-order secular Hamiltonian expansion and
numerical explorations performed with a chaos detector, we identified ranges of
values for the orbital inclinations and the mutual inclinations, which ensure
the long-term stability of the system. Our results were validated by comparison
with n-body simulations, showing the accuracy of our analytical approach up to
high mutual inclinations (approx. 70{\deg}-80{\deg}). Results. We find that,

sustained cycling is possible as the dynamics approach a heteroclinic cycle, in

unique consistent deformation of the gauge transformations. An extension of the
theory with fermion flavors does not change these features, while a
cosmological deformation becomes obstructed in the absence of other degrees of

coding method. One is that it does not exhibit better near-lossless performance
than other methods for HDR image compression with single-layer structure. The
other problem is that the determining the appropriate values of the coding
parameters may be required for each input image to achieve good compression
performance of near-lossless compression with the two-layer coding method of
the JPEG XT. To solve these problems, we focus on a histogram-packing technique
that takes into account the histogram sparseness of HDR images. We used
zero-skip quantization, which is an extension of the histogram-packing

near-lossless coding method. The experimental results indicate that the
proposed method exhibits not only a better near-lossless compression

there are no issue regarding the combination of parameter values without losing

developed within the algebraic multigrid and the functional maps literatures,

width measures, one containing primal treewidth and the other incidence
cliquewidth, such that in each class the width of optimal encodings only
differs by constant factors. Moreover, between the two classes the width
differs at most by a factor logarithmic in the number of variables. Both these

most commonly used in social research. In confirmatory factor analysis, the
researcher first develops a hypothesis about what factors they believe are
underlying the used measures and may impose constraints on the model based on
these a priori hypotheses. For example, if two factors are accounting for the
covariance in the measures, and these factors are unrelated to one another, we
can create a model where the correlation between factor X and factor Y is set
to zero. Measures could then be obtained to assess how well the fitted model
captured the covariance between all the items or measures in the model. Thus,
if the results of statistical tests of the model fit indicate a poor fit, the
model will be rejected. If the fit is weak, it may be due to a variety of
reasons. We propose to introduce state of the art techniques to do CFA in R

This is supplemented by gamma-ray excesses in the Galactic Centre and a

In this work we carefully model the magnetic field environments of M31 and M33

of material properties, loading, and environmental conditions. Developing
predictive models for dynamic modulus is efficient and cost effective. This
article focuses on developing an accurate Finite Element (FE) model using
mixture elastic modulus and asphalt binder properties to predict dynamic
modulus of asphalt mix in indirect tension mode. An Artificial Neural Network
(ANN) is used to back-calculate the elastic modulus of asphalt mixtures. The
developed FE model was verified against experimental results of field cores
from nine different pavement sections from five districts in the State of

realization of such measurements in different inertial reference frames because
of the relativity of simultaneity in relativistic situation. On the basis of
this analysis we conclude that the relativistic scattering of bound states of
particles should not be described by the fields defined on the Minkowski space,
but on the subset of simultaneous events, which is singled out from the tensor
product of two Minkowski spaces. Such fields are called multi-particle fields.
The arguments of the field functions in different reference frames are
impossible to relate neither by using Lorentz transformations, nor in any other
way. Next we build the dynamic equations for the multi-particle fields on the
subset of simultaneity, using the Lagrange method, similar to the case of
""usual"" single-particle fields. We then consider the gauge fields restoring the
local internal symmetry on the subset of simultaneity. The dynamic equations
for the multi-particle gauge fields describe such phenomena as confinement and
asymptotic freedom of colored objects under certain boundary conditions, and
the mechanism of spontaneous braking of symmetry -- under anothers. With these
dynamic equations we are able to describe within a single model the quark
confinement in hadrons, and their interaction during hadron scattering through
the exchange of the bound states of gluons -- the glueballs.

inspection tasks like pavement and automotive parts. The task involves
detection of deviation/divergence of anomalous samples from the normal ones.
Two of the major challenges in supervised anomaly detection are the lack of
labelled training data and the low availability of anomaly instances.
Semi-supervised methods which learn the underlying distribution of the normal
samples and then measure the deviation/divergence from the estimated model as
the anomaly score have limitations in their overall ability to detect
anomalies. This paper proposes the application of network-based deep transfer
learning using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the task of anomaly

the post-5G era. We suggest that human-centric mobile communications will still
be the most important application of 6G and the 6G network should be human
centric. Thus, high security, secrecy, and privacy should be key features of 6G
and should be given particular attention by the wireless research community. To
support this vision, we provide a systematic framework in which potential
application scenarios of 6G are anticipated and subdivided. We subsequently
define key potential features of 6G and discuss the required communication
technologies. We also explore the issues beyond communication technologies that
could hamper research and deployment of 6G.

  Learning-Powered Approaches","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1906.00939",,,,"cs.NI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traffic prediction plays a vital role in efficient planning and usage of
network resources in wireless networks. While traffic prediction in wired
networks is an established field, there is a lack of research on the analysis
of traffic in cellular networks, especially in a content-blind manner at the
user level. Here, we shed light into this problem by designing traffic
prediction tools that employ either statistical, rule-based, or deep machine
learning methods. First, we present an extensive experimental evaluation of the
designed tools over a real traffic dataset. Within this analysis, the impact of
different parameters, such as length of prediction, feature set used in
analyses, and granularity of data, on accuracy of prediction are investigated.
Second, regarding the coupling observed between behavior of traffic and its
generating application, we extend our analysis to the blind classification of
applications generating the traffic based on the statistics of traffic
arrival/departure. The results demonstrate presence of a threshold number of
previous observations, beyond which, deep machine learning can outperform
linear statistical learning, and before which, statistical learning outperforms
deep learning approaches. Further analysis of this threshold value represents a
strong coupling between this threshold, the length of future prediction, and
the feature set in use. Finally, through a case study, we present how the
experienced delay could be decreased by traffic arrival prediction.

m edges. In this method, we first construct a tree and then generate an
orthogonal layout (which is a weakly chordal graph on the n vertices) based on
this tree. In the next and final step, we insert additional edges to give us a
weakly chordal graph on m edges. Our algorithm ensures that the graph remains
weakly chordal after each edge is inserted. The time complexity of an insertion
query is O(n^3) time and an insertion takes constant time. On the other hand, a
generation algorithm based on finding a 2-pair takes O(nm) time using the
algorithm of Arikati and Rangan [1].

to their remarkable optical and spin properties under ambient conditions. Here
we experimentally demonstrated a hybrid fiber-based thermometer coupled with
nitrogen-vacancy center ensemble and a permanent magnet, where the temperature
sensitivity was improved by converting the temperature variation to the
magnetic field change based on the thermal-demagnetization of the permanent
magnet. We have achieved both large temperature working range (room temperature
to 373 K) and millikelvin sensitivity (1.6 mK/sqrt(Hz)), nearly 6-fold
improvement compared with conventional technique. This stable and compact
hybrid thermometer will enable a wide range of applications for large-area
detection and imaging with high temperature sensitivity.
