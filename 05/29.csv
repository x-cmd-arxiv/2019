similarity score between each pair of them. The goal is to partition the
objects into clusters so to minimise the disagreements with the scores. In this
work we investigate correlation clustering as an active learning problem: each
similarity score can be learned by making a query, and the goal is to minimise
both the disagreements and the total number of queries. On the one hand, we
describe simple active learning algorithms, which provably achieve an almost
optimal trade-off while giving cluster recovery guarantees, and we test them on
different datasets. On the other hand, we prove information-theoretical bounds
on the number of queries necessary to guarantee a prescribed disagreement
bound. These results give a rich characterization of the trade-off between
queries and clustering error.

vision. Unlike prior methods that focus on detecting low-level artifacts
generated during the manipulation process, we use an image retrieval approach
to tackle this problem. When given a spliced query image, our goal is to
retrieve the original image from a database of authentic images. To achieve
this goal, we propose representing an image by its constituent objects based on
the intuition that the finest granularity of manipulations is oftentimes at the
object-level. We introduce a framework, object embeddings for spliced image
retrieval (OE-SIR), that utilizes modern object detectors to localize object
regions. Each region is then embedded and collectively used to represent the
image. Further, we propose a student-teacher training paradigm for learning
discriminative embeddings within object regions to avoid expensive multiple
forward passes. Detailed analysis of the efficacy of different feature
embedding models is also provided in this study. Extensive experimental results
show that the OE-SIR achieves state-of-the-art performance in spliced image
retrieval.

go beyond individual coins for extracting general concepts and approaches. We
combine our findings with learnings from classical monetary policy, resulting
in a comprehensive taxonomy of cryptocurrency stabilization. We use our
taxonomy to highlight the current state of development from different

promote 1-to-1 stabilization targets to external assets, monetary policy
literature suggests that the smoothing of short term volatility is often a more
sustainable alternative. Our taxonomy bridges computer science and economics,
fostering the transfer of expertise. For example, we find that 38% of the

stabilization techniques that can render them vulnerable to speculative
economic attacks - an avoidable design flaw.

as well as closure phase. We undertook image reconstruction for
model-independent analysis, and geometric modeling. Additionally, the fitting
of radiative transfer models constrains the physical parameters of the disk.
For the first time, a dusty disk wind is introduced to the radiative transfer
code TORUS to model protoplanetary disks. Our implementation is motivated by
theoretical dusty disk winds, where magnetic field lines drive dust above the
disk plane close to the sublimation zone. Image reconstruction reveals an
inclined disk with slight asymmetry along its minor-axis, likely due to
inclination effects obscuring the inner disk rim through absorption of incident
star light on the near-side and thermal re-emission/scattering of the far-side.
Geometric modelling of a skewed ring finds the inner rim at 0.17+/-0.02 au with
an inclination of 50.9+/-1.0 degrees and minor axis position angle 60.8+/-1.2
degrees. Radiative transfer modelling shows a flared disk with an inner radius
at 0.18 au which implies a grain size of 0.4 um and a scale height of 15.0 au
at 100 au. Among the tested radiative transfer models, only the dusty disk wind
successfully accounts for the K-band excess by introducing dust above the
mid-plane.

  In this paper we present a simple and scalable approach to directly control
level sets of a deep neural network. Our method consists of two parts: (i)
sampling of the neural level sets, and (ii) relating the samples' positions to
the network parameters. The latter is achieved by a sample network that is
constructed by adding a single fixed linear layer to the original network. In
turn, the sample network can be used to incorporate the level set samples into
a loss function of interest.
  We have tested our method on three different learning tasks: improving
generalization to unseen data, training networks robust to adversarial attacks,
and curve and surface reconstruction from point clouds. For surface
reconstruction, we produce high fidelity surfaces directly from raw 3D point
clouds. When training small to medium networks to be robust to adversarial
attacks we obtain robust accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

source radii measured via the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss intensity interferometry
technique.

paper matching that directly addresses both of these issues. Since optimizing
our formulation is not always tractable, we introduce two new algorithms,
FairIR and FairFlow, for computing fair matchings that approximately optimize
the new formulation. FairIR solves a relaxation of the local fairness

that provably maximizes the objective and only compromises on fairness with
respect to reviewer loads and papers by a small constant. In contrast, FairFlow
is not provably guaranteed to produce fair matchings, however it can be 2x as

that directly optimize for fairness. Empirically, we demonstrate that both
FairIR and FairFlow improve fairness over standard matching algorithms on real

experimental data with the results of Inglis-Belyaev moments (supplemented by a
crude estimate of the so-called Thouless-Valatin corrections). The sample
includes 24 even-even and 31 odd-mass nuclei selected according to two
criteria: they should have good rotor properties and should not correspond to
low pairing-correlation regimes in their ground states. Calculations are
performed in the self-consistent Hartree-Fock plus BCS framework (implementing
a self-consistent blocking in the case of odd-mass nuclei). The Skyrme SIII
parametrization is used in the particle-hole channel and the fitted quantities
are the strengths of |Tz|=1 proton and neutron seniority residual interactions.
As a result, the two fits yield sets of strengths in excellent agreement: about
0.1% for the neutron parameters and 0.2% for protons. In contrast when one
performs such a fit on odd-even staggering from quantities deduced from BCS
gaps or minimal quasiparticle energies in even-even nuclei, as is traditional,
one obtains results significantly different from those obtained in the same
nuclei by a fit of moments of inertia. As a conclusion, beyond providing a
phenomenological tool for microscopic calculations in this region, we have

methods ignore the useful information from the label space, which is an
important factor accountable for the complicated data distributions associated

relationships have been rarely considered and discussed in the current work of
transfer learning. In this paper, we propose a novel relationship-aware

multi-class domain discriminator to enforce the learning of inter-class

structure with the inter-class dependencies that are characterized from
training the label predictor on source domain. Specifically, we impose a
regularization term to penalize the structure discrepancy between the
inter-class dependencies respectively estimated from domain discriminator and
label predictor. Through this alignment, our proposed method makes the
adversarial domain adaptation aware of the class relationships. Empirical
studies show that the incorporation of class relationships significantly
improves the performance on benchmark datasets.

stars in mono-age populations. We focus on stars between Galactocentric
distances of $R=6$ and 14 \,kpc, selected from the combined LAMOST DR4 red
clump giant stars and Gaia DR2 proper motion catalogue. We confirm the 3D
asymmetrical motions of recent works and provide time tagging of the Galactic
outer disk asymmetrical motions near the anticenter direction out to
Galactocentric distances of 14\,kpc. Radial Galactocentric motions reach values
up to 10 km s$^{-1}$, depending on the age of the population, and present a
north-south asymmetry in the region corresponding to density and velocity
substructures that were sensitive to the perturbations in the early 6 \,Gyr.
After that time, the disk stars in this asymmetrical structure have become
kinematically hotter, and are thus not sensitive to perturbations, and we find
the structure is a relatively younger population. With quantitative analysis,
we find stars both above and below the plane at $R\gtrsim 9$ kpc that exhibit
bending mode motions of which the sensitive duration is around 8 \,Gyr. We
speculate that the in-plane asymmetries might not be mainly caused by a fast
rotating bar, intrinsically elliptical outer disk, secular expansion of the
disk, or streams. Spiral arm dynamics, out-of-equilibrium models, minor mergers
or others are important contributors. Vertical motions might be dominated by
bending and breathing modes induced by complicated inner or external
perturbers. It is likely that many of these mechanisms are coupled together.

diagnostic tool in the medical field. The process of accurately diagnosing a
biopsy sample requires significant expertise in the field, and as such can be
time-consuming and is prone to uncertainty and error. With the advent of
digital pathology, using image recognition systems to highlight problem areas
or locate similar images can aid pathologists in making quick and accurate
diagnoses. In this paper, we specifically consider the encoded local
projections (ELP) algorithm, which has previously shown some success as a tool
for classification and recognition of histopathology images. We build on the
success of the ELP algorithm as a means for image classification and
recognition by proposing a modified algorithm which captures the local
frequency information of the image. The proposed algorithm estimates local
frequencies by quantifying the changes in multiple projections in local windows
of greyscale images. By doing so we remove the need to store the full
projections, thus significantly reducing the histogram size, and decreasing
computation time for image retrieval and classification tasks. Furthermore, we
investigate the effectiveness of applying our method to histopathology images
which have been digitally separated into their hematoxylin and eosin stain
components. The proposed algorithm is tested on the publicly available invasive
ductal carcinoma (IDC) data set. The histograms are used to train an SVM to
classify the data. The experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms
the original ELP algorithm in image retrieval tasks. On classification tasks,
the results are found to be comparable to state-of-the-art deep learning
methods and better than many handcrafted features from the literature.

  To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new

order dependencies (abcODs). Band ODs model the semantics of attributes that
are monotonically related with small variations without there being an
intrinsic violation of semantics. The class of abcODs generalizes band ODs to
make them more relevant to real-world applications by relaxing them to hold
approximately (abODs) with some exceptions and conditionally (bcODs) on subsets
of the data. We study the problem of automatic dependency discovery over a
hierarchy of abcODs. First, we propose a more efficient algorithm to discover
abODs than in recent prior work. The algorithm is based on a new optimization
to compute a longest monotonic band (longest subsequence of tuples that satisfy
a band OD) through dynamic programming by decreasing the runtime from O(n^2) to
O(n \log n) time. We then illustrate that while the discovery of bcODs is
relatively straightforward, there exist codependencies between approximation
and conditioning that make the problem of abcOD discovery challenging. The
naive solution is prohibitively expensive as it considers all possible
segmentations of tuples resulting in exponential time complexity. To reduce the
search space, we devise a dynamic programming algorithm for abcOD discovery
that determines the optimal solution in O(n^3 \log n) complexity. To further
optimize the performance, we adapt the algorithm to cheaply identify
consecutive tuples that are guaranteed to belong to the same band--this
improves the performance significantly in practice without losing optimality.
While unidirectional abcODs are most common in practice, for generality we
extend our algorithms with both ascending and descending orders to discover
bidirectional abcODs. Finally, we perform a thorough experimental evaluation of
our techniques over real-world and synthetic datasets.

downsampling is necessary to make training tractable. Although previous work
has solved this by linear downsampling, no extensive work has been done to
evaluate how texture selection benefits genre classification in the context of
the bag of frames track descriptions. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of
frame selection on automatic music genre classification in a bag of frames
scenario. We also present a novel texture selector based on K-Means aimed to
identify diverse sound textures within each track. We evaluated texture
selection in diverse datasets, four different feature sets, as well as its
relationship to a univariate feature selection strategy. The results show that
frame selection leads to significant improvement over the single vector
baseline on datasets consisting of full-length tracks, regardless of the
feature set. Results also indicate that the K-Means texture selector achieves
significant improvements over the baseline, using fewer textures per track than
the commonly used linear downsampling. The results also suggest that texture
selection is complementary to the feature selection strategy evaluated. Our
qualitative analysis indicates that texture variety within classes benefits
model generalization. Our analysis shows that selecting specific audio excerpts
can improve classification performance, and it can be done automatically.

controlled by $w$, $f_{\rm RD}$, and $H_{\rm inf}$ (the Hubble scale of

sequence of $N$ convex sets $K_1,\dots, K_N$ contained in a normed space

each $K_n$ picks a new point $x_n\in K_n$. At each step the player pays a
movement cost of $||x_n-x_{n-1}||$. The player aims to maintain a constant
competitive ratio against the minimum cost possible in hindsight, i.e. knowing

the competitive ratio.
  We give an improved algorithm achieving competitive ratio $d$ in any normed

algorithm also achieves competitive ratio $O(\sqrt{d\log N})$, nearly matching
a $\sqrt{d}$ lower bound when $N$ is subexponential in $d$. The approach

expressing these leading form factors in terms of generalised parton

ME-Net, images are preprocessed using two steps: first pixels are randomly
dropped from the image; then, the image is reconstructed using ME. We show that
this process destroys the adversarial structure of the noise, while
re-enforcing the global structure in the original image. Since humans typically
rely on such global structures in classifying images, the process makes the
network mode compatible with human perception. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on prevailing benchmarks such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN, and
Tiny-ImageNet. Comparing ME-Net with state-of-the-art defense mechanisms shows
that ME-Net consistently outperforms prior techniques, improving robustness
against both black-box and white-box attacks.

reductions in galactic cosmic ray count rates caused by a time-varying
depletion of particles with pitch angles near 90-deg, while intensities of
particles with other pitch angles remain unchanged. Between late 2012 and
mid-2017, three large-scale events occurred, lasting from ~100 to ~630 days.
Omnidirectional and directional high-energy data from Voyager 1's Cosmic Ray
Subsystem are used to report cosmic ray intensity variations. Omnidirectional
(greater than ~20 MeV) proton-dominated measurements show up to a 3.8%
intensity reduction. Bi-directional (greater than ~70 MeV) proton-dominated
measurements taken from various spacecraft orientations provide insight about
the depletion region's spatial properties. We characterize the anisotropy as a
""notch"" in an otherwise uniform pitch-angle distribution of varying depth and
width centered about 90 degrees in pitch angle space. The notch averages 22-deg
wide and 15% deep - signifying a depletion region that is broad and shallow.
There are indications that the anisotropy is formed by a combination of
magnetic trapping and cooling downstream of solar-induced transient
disturbances in a region that is also likely influenced by the highly

through an ambient medium. Depending on the mass and energy involved in the
explosion, the shock velocity $V$ can be non-relativistic ($V \ll c$, where $c$
is the speed of light), ultra-relativistic ($V \simeq c$), or moderately
relativistic ($V \sim few\times 0.1c$). While self-similar, energy-conserving
solutions to the fluid equations that describe the shock propagation are known
in the non-relativistic (the Sedov-Taylor blastwave) and ultra-relativistic
(the Blandford-McKee blastwave) regimes, the finite speed of light violates
scale invariance and self-similarity when the flow is only mildly relativistic.
By treating relativistic terms as perturbations to the fluid equations, here we
derive the $\mathcal{O}(V^2/c^2)$, energy-conserving corrections to the
non-relativistic, Sedov-Taylor solution for the propagation of a strong shock.
We show that relativistic terms modify the post-shock fluid velocity, density,
pressure, and the shock speed itself, the latter being constrained by global
energy conservation. We derive these corrections for a range of post-shock
adiabatic indices $\gamma$ (which we set as a fixed number for the post-shock
gas) and ambient power-law indices $n$, where the density of the ambient medium
$\rho_{\rm a}$ into which the shock advances declines with spherical radius $r$
as $\rho_{\rm a} \propto r^{-n}$. For Sedov-Taylor blastwaves that terminate in
a contact discontinuity with diverging density, we find that there is no
relativistic correction to the Sedov-Taylor solution that simultaneously
satisfies the fluid equations and conserves energy. These solutions have
implications for relativistic supernovae, the transition from ultra- to
sub-relativistic velocities in gamma-ray bursts, and other high-energy
phenomena.

approximation methods have been developed. However, these approximation methods
have not been compared and therefore their relative advantages and
disadvantages are not clear. A consortium of EVSI researchers, including the
developers of several approximation methods, compared four EVSI methods using
three previously published health economic models. The examples were chosen to
represent a range of real-world contexts, including situations with multiple
study outcomes, missing data, and data from an observational rather than a

compared, and the relative advantages and implementation challenges of the
methods were highlighted. In each example, the approximation methods took
minutes or hours to achieve reasonably accurate EVSI estimates, whereas the
traditional Monte Carlo method took weeks. Specific methods are particularly
suited to problems where we wish to compare multiple proposed sample sizes,

coalescence time scales and merger locations. In this paper, we focus on the
dynamics of NSBs in the gravitational potentials of different types of host
galaxies and on its impact on the subsequent galactic enrichment. We find that,
for a $\sim t^{-1}$ delay time distribution, even when receiving a low kick
($\sim 10~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$) from the second supernova explosion, in shallow
dwarf galaxy potentials NSBs tend to merge with a large off-set from the host
galaxy. This results in a significant geometrical dilution of the amount of
produced $r-$process elements that fall back and pollute the host galaxy gas
reservoir. The combination of dilution and small number statistics produces a
large scatter in the expected $r$-process enrichment within a single UFD or
classical dwarf galaxy. Comparison between our results and observed europium
abundances reveals a tension that even a systematic choice of optimistic
parameters in our models cannot release. Such a discrepancy could point to the
need of additional $r$-process production sites that suffer less severe
dilution or to a population of extremely fast merging binaries.

each unit with maximally similar peers that had an alternative treatment
status--essentially replicating a randomized block design. However, as one
considers a growing number of continuous features, a curse of dimensionality
applies making asymptotically valid inference impossible (Abadie and Imbens,
2006). The alternative of ignoring plausibly relevant features is certainly no
better, and the resulting trade-off substantially limits the application of
matching methods to ""wide"" datasets. Instead, Li and Fu (2017) recasts the
problem of matching in a metric learning framework that maps features to a
low-dimensional space that facilitates ""closer matches"" while still capturing
important aspects of unit-level heterogeneity. However, that method lacks key
theoretical guarantees and can produce inconsistent estimates in cases of
heterogeneous treatment effects. Motivated by straightforward extension of
existing results in the matching literature, we present alternative techniques
that learn latent matching features through either MLPs or through siamese
neural networks trained on a carefully selected loss function. We benchmark the
resulting alternative methods in simulations as well as against two
experimental data sets--including the canonical NSW worker training program
data set--and find superior performance of the neural-net-based methods.

intrinsic orientation, which quantifies the contribution of an individual atom
to the total nonaffine modulus of the system. We find that the atomic
nonaffinity can efficiently characterize the locations of the shear
transformation zones, with a predicative capacity comparable to the best

third order derivative of energy with respect to coordinates, reveals an
intrinsic softest shear orientation. By analyzing the angle between this
orientation and the shear loading direction, it is possible to predict the
protocol-dependent response of plastic events. Employing the new method, the
distribution of orientations of shear transformation zones in a model
two-dimensional amorphous solids can be measured. The resulting plastic events
can be understood from a simple model of independent plastic events occurring

actuation parameters guaranteeing fast convergence and avoiding suboptimal
local minima. This challenge is addressed by a new optimizer, called
explorative gradient method (EGM). EGM alternatively performs one exploitive
downhill simplex step and an explorative Latin hypercube sampling iteration.
Thus, the convergence rate of a gradient based method is guaranteed while, at
the same time, better minima are explored. For an analytical multi-modal test
function, EGM is shown to significantly outperform the downhill simplex method,
the random restart variant, Latin hypercube sampling, Monte Carlo iterations
and the genetic algorithm. EGM is applied to minimize the net drag power of the
two-dimensional fluidic pinball benchmark with three cylinder rotations as
actuation parameters. The net drag power is reduced by $40\%$ employing direct
numerical simulations at a Reynolds number of $100$ based on the cylinder
diameter. This optimal actuation leads to $98\%$ drag reduction employing
Coanda forcing for boat tailing and partial stabilization of vortex shedding.
The price is an actuation energy corresponding to $58\%$ of the unforced
parasitic drag power. EGM is also used to minimize drag of the $35^\circ$
slanted Ahmed body employing distributed steady blowing with 10 inputs. $17\%$
drag reduction are achieved using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations
(RANS) at the Reynolds number $Re_H=1.9 \times 10^5$ based on the height of the
Ahmed body. The optimal actuation emulates boat tailing by inward-directed
blowing with velocities which are comparable to the oncoming velocity. We
expect that EGM will be employed as efficient optimizer in many future active
flow control plants.

collapse is obtained by adding a small imaginary component to the gravitational

very fast collapse of QSMDS (quantum superpositions of macroscopically distinct
quantum states) of a solid object, varying as the fifth power of its size. The
model does not require adding any dimensional constant to those of standard

repeat our analysis on samples from previous studies. For all methods we use,
the resulting line has a negative slope, which is consistent with models of

both pairs are interpreted to have volatile-poor compositions. In conjunction

spin-up and/or dissociation of a binary precursor. Backwards orbital
integrations suggest a separation age of <10 kyr for the pair 2017 SN16 -- 2018

the ages of such young pairs is of great value for testing models of space

  Programs that Use Concurrent Objects",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been observed that linearizability, the prevalent consistency
condition for implementing concurrent objects, does not preserve some
probability distributions. A stronger condition, called strong linearizability
has been proposed, but its study has been somewhat ad-hoc. This paper
investigates strong linearizability by casting it in the context of
observational refinement of objects. We present a strengthening of
observational refinement, which generalizes strong linearizability, obtaining
several important implications.
  When a concrete concurrent object refining another, more abstract object -
often sequential - the correctness of a program employing the concrete object
can be verified by considering its behaviors when using the more abstract
object. This means that trace properties of a program using the concrete object
can be proved by considering the program with the abstract object. This,
however, does not hold for hyperproperties, including many security properties
and probability distributions of events.
  We define strong observational refinement, a strengthening of refinement that
preserves hyperproperties, and prove that it is equivalent to the existence of
forward simulations. We show that strong observational refinement generalizes
strong linearizability. This implies that strong linearizability is also
equivalent to forward simulation, and shows that strongly linearizable
implementations can be composed both horizontally (i.e., locality) and
vertically (i.e., with instantiation).
  For situations where strongly linearizable implementations do not exist (or
are less efficient), we argue that reasoning about hyperproperties of programs
can be simplified by strong observational refinement of abstract objects that
are not necessarily sequential.

to study the core accretion theory of planets formation. These systems are
however, insufficiently studied. In this paper we present the main metallicity
and lithium abundance properties of these stars together with stars with only
debris discs and stars with only planets. Stars without detected planets nor
discs are also considered. The analysed sample is formed by main-sequence FGK
field single stars. Apart from the basic stellar parameters, we include the use
of dusty discs masses. The main results show for the first time that the dust
mass of debris disc stars with planets correlate with metallicity. We confirm
that these disc dust masses are related to their central stellar masses.
Separately, the masses of stars and those of planets also correlate with
metallicity. We conclude that two conditions are necessary to form giant
planets: to have a sufficient metallicity and also a sufficient protoplanetary
mass of gas and dust. The debris discs masses of stars without giant planets do
not correlate with metallicity, because they do not fulfil these two
conditions. Concerning lithium, by adopting a stellar model for lithium
depletion based on a strong interaction between the star and a protoplanetary
disc, we found that in agreement with the model predictions, observations
indicate that the main lithium depletion occurs during this initial
protoplanetary evolution stage. We show that the ultimately lithium depletion
is independent of the presence or absence of planets and appears to be only age
dependent.

  equation",,,"10.1088/1361-6420/ab2aab",,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reaction-diffusion equations are one of the most common partial differential
equations used to model physical phenomenon. They arise as the combination of
two physical processes: a driving force $f(u)$ that depends on the state
variable $u$ and a diffusive mechanism that spreads this effect over a spatial
domain. The canonical form is $u_t - \triangle u = f(u)$. Application areas
include chemical processes, heat flow models and population dynamics. The
direct or forwards problem for such equations is now very well-developed and
understood. However, our interest lies in the inverse problem of recovering the
reaction term $f(u)$ not just at the level of determining a few parameters in a
known functional form, but recovering the complete functional form itself. To
achieve this we set up the usual paradigm for the parabolic equation where $u$
is subject to both given initial and boundary data, then prescribe overposed
data consisting of the solution at a later time $T$. For example, in the case
of a population model this amounts to census data at a fixed time. Our approach
will be two-fold.First we will transform the inverse problem into an equivalent
nonlinear mapping from which we seek a fixed point. We will be able to prove
important features of this map such as a self-mapping property and give
conditions under which it is contractive. Second, we consider the direct map
from $f$ through the partial differential operator to the overposed data. We
will investigate Newton schemes for this case. In recent decades various
anomalous processes have been used to generalize classical Brownian diffusion.
Amongst the most popular is one that replaces the usual time derivative by a
fractional one of order $\alpha \leq 1$. We will also include this model in our
analysis. The final section of the paper shows numerical reconstructions that
demonstrate the viability of the suggested approaches.

representation language intended to capture the meaning of a sentence, which
may be represented as a single-rooted directed acyclic graph with labeled nodes
and edges. The automatic evaluation of this structure plays an important role
in the development of better systems, as well as for semantic annotation.
Despite there is one available metric, smatch, it has some drawbacks. For
instance, smatch creates a self-relation on the root of the graph, has weights
for different error types, and does not take into account the dependence of the
elements in the AMR structure. With these drawbacks, smatch masks several
problems of the AMR parsers and distorts the evaluation of the AMRs. In view of
this, in this paper, we introduce an extended metric to evaluate AMR parsers,
which deals with the drawbacks of the smatch metric. Finally, we compare both
metrics, using four well-known AMR parsers, and we argue that our metric is
more refined, robust, fairer, and faster than smatch.

  Paper)","This paper extends IJCAI-19 paper with an appendix",,,,"cs.AI cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generalized planning is about finding plans that solve collections of
planning instances, often infinite collections, rather than single instances.
Recently it has been shown how to reduce the planning problem for generalized
planning to the planning problem for a qualitative numerical problem; the
latter being a reformulation that simultaneously captures all the instances in
the collection. An important thread of research thus consists in finding such
reformulations, or abstractions, automatically. A recent proposal learns the
abstractions inductively from a finite and small sample of transitions from
instances in the collection. However, as in all inductive processes, the
learned abstraction is not guaranteed to be correct for the whole collection.
In this work we address this limitation by performing an analysis of the
abstraction with respect to the collection, and show how to obtain formal
guarantees for generalization. These guarantees, in the form of first-order
formulas, may be used to 1) define subcollections of instances on which the
abstraction is guaranteed to be sound, 2) obtain necessary conditions for
generalization under certain assumptions, and 3) do automated synthesis of
complex invariants for planning problems. Our framework is general, it can be
extended or combined with other approaches, and it has applications that go
beyond generalized planning.

without vacuum state allow for fluctuation-free erasure.

$\sim$25 nm wrinkle amplitude and 10-30$\%$ surface area coverage upon cooling

that ``floor'' consists of individual rooms that can also be referred to in

Logic (LTL) to interpret temporal language (such as ""before""), and Abstract
Markov Decision Processes (AMDPs) to interpret hierarchical abstractions (such
as ""kitchen"" and ""second floor""), separately. To handle both types of commands
at once, we introduce the Abstract Product Markov Decision Process (AP-MDP), a
novel approach capable of representing non-Markovian reward functions at
different levels of abstractions. The AP-MDP framework translates LTL into its
corresponding automata, creates a product Markov Decision Process (MDP) of the
LTL specification and the environment MDP, and decomposes the problem into
subproblems to enable efficient planning with abstractions. AP-MDP performs
faster than a non-hierarchical method of solving LTL problems in over 95% of
tasks, and this number only increases as the size of the environment domain
increases. We also present a neural sequence-to-sequence model trained to
translate language commands into LTL expression, and a new corpus of
non-Markovian language commands spanning different levels of abstraction. We
test our framework with the collected language commands on a drone,
demonstrating that our approach enables a robot to efficiently solve temporal

rules that account for long-term, circuit-wide effects of synaptic changes. In
other words, neural circuits must solve a credit assignment problem to
appropriately assign responsibility for global network behavior to individual
circuit components. Furthermore, biological constraints demand that plasticity
rules are spatially and temporally local; that is, synaptic changes can depend
only on variables accessible to the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. While
artificial intelligence offers a computational solution for credit assignment,
namely backpropagation through time (BPTT), this solution is wildly
biologically implausible. It requires both nonlocal computations and unlimited
memory capacity, as any synaptic change is a complicated function of the entire
history of network activity. Similar nonlocality issues plague other approaches
such as FORCE (Sussillo et al. 2009). Overall, we are still missing a model for
learning in recurrent circuits that both works computationally and uses only
local updates. Leveraging recent advances in machine learning on approximating
gradients for BPTT, we derive biologically plausible plasticity rules that
enable recurrent networks to accurately learn long-term dependencies in
sequential data. The solution takes the form of neurons with segregated voltage
compartments, with several synaptic sub-populations that have different
functional properties. The network operates in distinct phases during which
each synaptic sub-population is updated by its own local plasticity rule. Our

differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), this cost is not
borne equally: accuracy of DP models drops much more for the underrepresented

  For example, a gender classification model trained using DP-SGD exhibits much
lower accuracy for black faces than for white faces. Critically, this gap is
bigger in the DP model than in the non-DP model, i.e., if the original model is
unfair, the unfairness becomes worse once DP is applied. We demonstrate this
effect for a variety of tasks and models, including sentiment analysis of text

Moreover, scenarios such as committee or board elections require voting rules

the votes and choosing the top-$k$ candidates receiving the most votes. An
agent may manipulate the vote to achieve a better outcome by voting in a way

highest utilities. Using simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these

quasar population: are they blue quasars observed at a (slight) inclination
angle or do they represent a transitional phase in the evolution of quasars?
Identifying fundamental differences between red and blue quasars is key to
discriminate between these two paradigms. To robustly explore this, we have
uniformly selected quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with mid-infrared
counterparts, carefully controlling for luminosity and redshift effects. We
take a novel approach to distinguish between colour-selected quasars in the
redshift range of $0.2 < z < 2.4$ by constructing redshift-sensitive $g^* -
i^*$ colour cuts. From cross-matching this sample to the Faint Images of the
Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST) survey, we have found a factor
$\approx$ 3 larger fraction of radio-detected red quasars with respect to that
of blue quasars. Through a visual inspection of the FIRST images and an
assessment of the radio luminosities (rest-frame ${L_{\rm 1.4~GHz}}$ and
${L_{\rm 1.4~GHz}}/{L_{\rm 6\mu m}}$) we find that the radio-detection excess
for red quasars is primarily due to compact and radio-faint systems (around the
radio quiet--radio loud threshold). We show that our results rule out
orientation as the origin for the differences between red and blue quasars and
argue that they provide broad agreement with an evolutionary model.

architectures. We show that a family of dynamics related to the continuous-time

arbitrarily small bounded disturbances. Indeed, while solutions of these
dynamics may converge to the set of optimizers, in general, this set may not be

byproduct, we propose a framework where we regularize the dynamics by using
resetting mechanisms that are modeled by well-posed hybrid dynamical systems.
For these hybrid dynamics, we establish uniform asymptotic stability and

filling their programming needs. Although code examples on those forums are
good starting points, they are often incomplete and inadequate for developers'
local program contexts; adaptation of those examples is necessary to integrate
them to production code. As a consequence, the process of adapting online code
examples is done over and over again, by multiple developers independently. Our
work extensively studies these adaptations and variations, serving as the basis
for a tool that helps integrate these online code examples in a target context
in an interactive manner.
  We perform a large-scale empirical study about the nature and extent of
adaptations and variations of SO snippets. We construct a comprehensive dataset
linking SO posts to GitHub counterparts based on clone detection, time stamp
analysis, and explicit URL references. We then qualitatively inspect 400 SO
examples and their GitHub counterparts and develop a taxonomy of 24 adaptation
types. Using this taxonomy, we build an automated adaptation analysis technique
on top of GumTree to classify the entire dataset into these types. We build a
Chrome extension called ExampleStack that automatically lifts an
adaptation-aware template from each SO example and its GitHub counterparts to
identify hot spots where most changes happen. A user study with sixteen
programmers shows that seeing the commonalities and variations in similar
GitHub counterparts increases their confidence about the given SO example, and
helps them grasp a more comprehensive view about how to reuse the example
differently and avoid common pitfalls.

was introduced as an effective solution to overcoming losses in metamaterials.
Implementations with near-field imaging applications have indicated substantial
performance enhancements even in the presence of noise. This powerful and
versatile compensation technique, which has since been renamed to a more
generalized active convolved illumination, offers new possibilities of
improving the performance of many previously conceived metamaterial-based
devices and conventional imaging systems. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive mathematical breakdown of active convolved illumination for
coherent imaging. Our analysis highlights the distinctive features of active
convolved illumination, such as selective spectral amplification and
correlations, and provides a rigorous understanding of the loss compensation
process. These features are achieved by an auxiliary source coherently
superimposed with the object field. The auxiliary source is designed to have
three important properties. First, it is correlated with the object field.
Second, it is defined over a finite spectral bandwidth. Third, it is amplified
over that selected bandwidth. We derive the variance for the image spectrum and
show that utilizing the auxiliary source with the above properties can
significantly improve the spectral signal-to-noise ratio and resolution limit.
Besides enhanced superresolution imaging, the theory can be potentially
generalized to the compensation of information or photon loss in a wide variety
of coherent and incoherent linear systems including those, for example, in
atmospheric imaging, time-domain spectroscopy, ${\cal PT}$ symmetric
non-Hermitian photonics, and even quantum computing.

$10^{15.5}M_\odot$ (Coma-like clusters). We analyse optical and infrared

minority ($\sim 9$\%) of them are star-forming. We find that the optical $g-r$
colours are consistent with those of red sequence galaxies at the same
redshifts; however, we detect the presence of a tail of blue and mostly
star-forming BCGs preferentially located in low-mass clusters and groups.
Although the blue tail is dominated by star-forming galaxies, we find that
star-forming BCGs may also have red $g-r$ colours, indicating dust-enshrouded
star formation. The fraction of star-forming BCGs increases with redshift and
decreases with cluster mass and BCG stellar mass. We find that cool-core
clusters host both star-forming and quiescent BCGs; however, non cool-core
clusters are dominated by quiescent BCGs. Star formation appears thus as the
result of processes that depend on stellar mass, cluster mass and cooling state
of the intra-cluster medium. Our results suggest no significant stellar mass
growth at $z<0.35$, supporting the notion that BCGs had accreted most of their

hierarchy of coupled differential equations. Moment closure methods are used to
approximate a subset of low order moments by terminating the hierarchy at some
order and replacing higher order terms with functions of lower order ones. For
a given system, it is not known beforehand which closure approximation is
optimal, i.e. which higher order terms are relevant in the current regime.
Further, the generalization of such approximations is typically poor, as higher
order corrections may become relevant over long timescales. We have developed a
method to learn moment closure approximations directly from data using dynamic
Boltzmann distributions (DBDs). The dynamics of the distribution are
parameterized using basis functions from finite element methods, such that the
approach can be applied without knowing the true dynamics of the system under
consideration. We use the hierarchical architecture of deep Boltzmann machines
(DBMs) with multinomial latent variables to learn closure approximations for
progressively higher order spatial correlations. The learning algorithm uses a
centering transformation, allowing the dynamic DBM to be trained without the
need for pre-training. We demonstrate the method for a Lotka-Volterra system on
a lattice, a typical example in spatial chemical reaction networks. The
approach can be applied broadly to learn deep generative models in applications

science where nodes in a graph represent distributed processes and edges
between nodes represent a form of dynamic coupling. When a network topology is
already known (or partially known), two associated goals are (i) to derive
estimators for nodes of the network which cannot be directly observed or are
impractical to measure; and (ii) to quantitatively identify the dynamic
relations between nodes. In this article we address both problems in the
challenging scenario where only some outputs of the network are being measured
and the inputs are not accessible. The approach makes use of the notion of
$d$-separation for the graph associated with the network. In the considered
class of networks, it is shown that the proposed technique can determine or
guide the choice of optimal sparse estimators. The article also derives
identification methods that are applicable to cases where loops are present
providing a different perspective on the problem of closed-loop identification.
The notion of $d$-separation is a central concept in the area of probabilistic
graphical models, thus an additional contribution is to create connections
between control theory and machine learning techniques.

present a three-part proposal for integrating robust streaming into the SQL

tables as well as streaming data, (2) event time semantics, (3) a limited set
of optional keyword extensions to control the materialization of time-varying

Thus, in this work, we propose a method to synthesize free viewpoint renderings

our approach can reduce the data size significantly as well as handling the

The construction process of the classifier consists of two phases. The first
phase is to formulate the model at the greatest level of granularity, while the
later stage aims to reduce the complexity of the constructed model and deduce
it from data at higher abstraction levels. Experimental outcomes conducted
comprehensively on both synthetic and real datasets indicated the efficiency of
our method in terms of training time and predictive performance in comparison

when using linear function approximators, the situation for nonlinear models is
far less understood, and divergent examples are known. Here we take a first
step towards extending theoretical convergence guarantees to TD learning with
nonlinear function approximation. More precisely, we consider the expected
learning dynamics of the TD(0) algorithm for value estimation. As the step-size
converges to zero, these dynamics are defined by a nonlinear ODE which depends
on the geometry of the space of function approximators, the structure of the
underlying Markov chain, and their interaction. We find a set of function
approximators that includes ReLU networks and has geometry amenable to TD
learning regardless of environment, so that the solution performs about as well
as linear TD in the worst case. Then, we show how environments that are more
reversible induce dynamics that are better for TD learning and prove global
convergence to the true value function for well-conditioned function
approximators. Finally, we generalize a divergent counterexample to a family of
divergent problems to demonstrate how the interaction between approximator and
environment can go wrong and to motivate the assumptions needed to prove
convergence.

  Optimization",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Decomposition plays a significant role in cooperative co-evolution which
shows great potential in large scale black-box optimization. However, current
popular decomposition algorithms generally require to sample and evaluate a
large number of solutions for interdependency detection, which is very
time-consuming. To address this issue, this study proposes a new decomposition
algorithm named fast differential grouping (FDG). FDG first identifies the type
of an instance by detecting the interdependencies of a few pairs of variable
subsets selected according to certain rules, and thus can rapidly complete the
decomposition of a fully separable or nonseparable instance. For an identified
partially separable instance, FDG converts the key decomposition process into a
search process in a binary tree by taking corresponding variable subsets as
tree nodes. This enables it to directly deduce the interdependency related to a
child node by reutilizing the solutions sampled for corresponding parent and
brother nodes. To support the above operations, this study designs a normalized
variable-subset-oriented interdependency indicator, which can adaptively
generate decomposition thresholds according to its distribution and thus
enhances decomposition accuracy. Computational complexity analysis and
experimental results verify that FDG outperforms popular decomposition
algorithms. Further tests indicate that FDG embedded in a cooperative
co-evolution framework can achieve highly competitive optimization results as
compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms for large scale black-box
optimization.

critical in various decision-making problems, e.g., reinforcement learning,
detecting adversarial attack, self-driving car. As the model posterior is
almost always intractable, most efforts were made on finding an accurate
approximation the true posterior. Even though a decent estimation of the model
posterior is obtained, another approximation is required to compute the
predictive distribution over the desired output. A common accurate solution is
to use Monte Carlo (MC) integration. However, it needs to maintain a large
number of samples, evaluate the model repeatedly and average multiple model
outputs. In many real-world cases, this is computationally prohibitive. In this
work, assuming that the exact posterior or a decent approximation is obtained,
we propose a generic framework to approximate the output probability
distribution induced by model posterior with a parameterized model and in an
amortized fashion. The aim is to approximate the true uncertainty of a specific
Bayesian model, meanwhile alleviating the heavy workload of MC integration at
testing time. The proposed method is universally applicable to Bayesian
classification models that allow for posterior sampling. Theoretically, we show
that the idea of amortization incurs no additional costs on approximation
performance. Empirical results validate the strong practical performance of our
approach.

overcomes the fundamental limitations of de facto approaches to combatting

We observed an effective repulsion between particles with nonuniform density in

cross-modal hashing methods optimistically assume that the correspondence
between training samples across modalities are readily available. This
assumption is unrealistic in practical applications. In addition, these methods
generally require the same number of samples across different modalities, which
restricts their flexibility. We propose a flexible cross-modal hashing approach
(Flex-CMH) to learn effective hashing codes from weakly-paired data, whose
correspondence across modalities are partially (or even totally) unknown.
FlexCMH first introduces a clustering-based matching strategy to explore the
local structure of each cluster, and thus to find the potential correspondence
between clusters (and samples therein) across modalities. To reduce the impact
of an incomplete correspondence, it jointly optimizes in a unified objective
function the potential correspondence, the cross-modal hashing functions
derived from the correspondence, and a hashing quantitative loss. An
alternative optimization technique is also proposed to coordinate the
correspondence and hash functions, and to reinforce the reciprocal effects of
the two objectives. Experiments on publicly multi-modal datasets show that
FlexCMH achieves significantly better results than state-of-the-art methods,

optimization problems be extended to multi-robot sequential assignment
planning? In addition to the challenge of achieving near-optimal performance in
large problems, transferability to an unseen number of robots and tasks is
another key challenge for real-world applications. In this paper, we suggest a
method that achieves the first success in both challenges for robot/machine
scheduling problems.
  Our method comprises of three components. First, we show a robot scheduling
problem can be expressed as a random probabilistic graphical model (PGM). We
develop a mean-field inference method for random PGM and use it for Q-function
inference. Second, we show that transferability can be achieved by carefully
designing two-step sequential encoding of problem state. Third, we resolve the
computational scalability issue of fitted Q-iteration by suggesting a heuristic
auction-based Q-iteration fitting method enabled by transferability we
achieved.
  We apply our method to discrete-time, discrete space problems (Multi-Robot
Reward Collection (MRRC)) and scalably achieve 97% optimality with
transferability. This optimality is maintained under stochastic contexts. By
extending our method to continuous time, continuous space formulation, we claim
to be the first learning-based method with scalable performance among
multi-machine scheduling problems; our method scalability achieves comparable
performance to popular metaheuristics in Identical parallel machine scheduling
(IPMS) problems.

$\rho_1$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with a strictly convex cost function. A popular
relaxation of the problem is the one-parameter family called the entropic cost
problem. The entropic cost $K_h$, $h>0$, is significantly faster to compute and
$h K_h$ is known to converge to the optimal transport cost as $h$ goes to zero.
We are interested the rate of convergence. We show that the difference between
$K_h$ and $1/h$ times the optimal cost of transport has a pointwise limit when
transporting a compactly supported density to another that satisfies a few
other technical restrictions. This limit is the relative entropy of $\rho_1$
with respect to a Riemannian volume measure on $\mathbb{R}^d$ that measures the
local sensitivity of the transport map. For the quadratic Wasserstein
transport, this relative entropy is exactly one half of the difference of
entropies of $\rho_1$ and $\rho_0$. In that case we complement the results of
Adams et al., Duong et al, and Erbar et al. who all use gamma convergence. More
surprisingly, we demonstrate that this difference of two entropies (plus the
cost) is also the limit for the Dirichlet transport introduced recently by Pal
and Wong. The latter can be thought of as a multiplicative analog of the
Wasserstein transport and corresponds to a non-local operator. It hints at an
underlying gradient flow of entropy, in the sense of Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto,
even when the cost function is not a metric. The proofs are based on Gaussian
approximations to Schr\""odinger bridges as $h$ approaches zero.

encoded in its weights. How this information affects the response of the

and measuring information entails some subtleties, since a trained network is a
deterministic map, so standard information measures can be degenerate. We
measure information in a neural network via the optimal trade-off between
accuracy of the response and complexity of the weights, measured by their
coding length. Depending on the choice of code, the definition can reduce to
standard measures such as Shannon Mutual Information and Fisher Information.
However, the more general definition allows us to relate information to
generalization and invariance, through a novel notion of effective information
in the activations of a deep network. We establish a novel relation between the
information in the weights and the effective information in the activations,
and use this result to show that models with low (information) complexity not
only generalize better, but are bound to learn invariant representations of
future inputs. These relations hinge not only on the architecture of the model,

Strategic Program, a wide-field optical imaging survey on the 8.2 meter Subaru
Telescope. The release includes data from 174 nights of observation through
January 2018. The Wide layer data cover about 300 deg^2 in all five broadband
filters (grizy) to the nominal survey exposure (10min in gr and 20min in izy).
Partially observed areas are also included in the release; about 1100 deg^2 is
observed in at least one filter and one exposure. The median seeing in the
i-band is 0.6 arcsec, demonstrating the superb image quality of the survey. The
Deep (26 deg^2) and UltraDeep (4 deg^2) data are jointly processed and the
UltraDeep-COSMOS field reaches an unprecedented depth of i~28 at 5 sigma for
point sources. In addition to the broad-bands, narrow-band data are also
available in the Deep and UltraDeep fields. This release includes a major
update to the processing pipeline, including improved sky subtraction, PSF
modeling, object detection, and artifact rejection. The overall data quality
has been improved, but this release is not without problems; there is a
persistent deblender problem as well as new issues with masks around bright
stars. The user is encouraged to review the issue list before utilizing the
data for scientific explorations. All the image products as well as catalog
products are available for download. The catalogs are also loaded to a
database, which provides an easy interface for users to retrieve data for
objects of interest. In addition to these main data products, detailed galaxy
shape measurements withheld from the Public Data Release 1 (PDR1) are now
available to the community. The shape catalog is drawn from the S16A internal
release, which has a larger area than PDR1 (160 deg^2). All products are
available at the data release site, https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/.

electrical stimulation of the median nerve demonstrate a well-established

comparable values obtained for normally rising and falling segments of the
smooth regions, and due to noise. In this study, the usefulness of the wavelet
transform (WT), that provides localized measures of non-stationary signals is
investigated. The Haar WT was used to analyze a total of 36 M-responses
recorded from the median nerves of 6 normal subjects (having smooth shape) and
12 subjects with assumed neurological disorders (having kinks), for two points
of stimulation on the same nerve. Features in the time-scale representation of
the M-responses were studied using WT to distinguish smooth M-responses from
ones with kinks. Variations in the coefficient line of the WT were also studied
to allow visualization of WT at different scales (inverse of frequency). The
high and low frequency regions in the WT came out distinctively which helped
identifications of kinks even of very subtle ones in the M-responses which were
difficult to obtain using the differentiated signal. In conclusion, the wavelet
analysis may be a technique of choice in identifying kinks in M-responses in
relation to time, thus enhancing the accuracy of neurological diagnosis.

contributing to Matryoshka's impressive performance: it collects only the
nesting constraints that may cause the target conditional statements
unreachable, which greatly simplifies the constraints that it has to solve.

existence of the $C^\infty[0,1]$ steady-state solution by the method of upper

propagating labels in kernel space. A Kernel-Induced Label Propagation
(Kernel-LP) framework by mapping is proposed for high-dimensional data
classification using the most informative patterns of data in kernel space. The
essence of Kernel-LP is to perform joint label propagation and adaptive weight
learning in a transformed kernel space. That is, our Kernel-LP changes the task
of label propagation from the commonly-used Euclidean space in most existing
work to kernel space. The motivation of our Kernel-LP to propagate labels and
learn the adaptive weights jointly by the assumption of an inner product space
of inputs, i.e., the original linearly inseparable inputs may be mapped to be
separable in kernel space. Kernel-LP is based on existing positive and negative
LP model, i.e., the effects of negative label information are integrated to
improve the label prediction power. Also, Kernel-LP performs adaptive weight
construction over the same kernel space, so it can avoid the tricky process of
choosing the optimal neighborhood size suffered in traditional criteria. Two
novel and efficient out-of-sample approaches for our Kernel-LP to involve new
test data are also presented, i.e., (1) direct kernel mapping and (2) kernel
mapping-induced label reconstruction, both of which purely depend on the kernel
matrix between training set and testing set. Owing to the kernel trick, our
algorithms will be applicable to handle the high-dimensional real data.
Extensive results on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach.

breakup mechanism of an evaporating contact-free (acoustic levitation) emulsion
droplet (water-oil) under external heating. Three distinct regimes are observed
during the lifespan of the evaporating droplet. Initially, the droplet diameter
regresses linearly with time, followed by vapor bubble nucleation due to a
significant difference in the boiling temperature among the components of the
emulsion. The collapse of this bubble results in a high-intensity breakup of
the droplet leading to the propulsion of residual liquid in the form of a
crown-like sheet. The area of the expanding crown varies linearly with the
square of the time. It is hypothesized that the expansion of the liquid sheet
centrifuges the larger water sub-droplets towards the edge, resulting in unique
spatial segregation. Subsequently, we report the first observation of complex
patches (representing water sub-droplets) and the rupture of the thin sheet
adjacent to patches into holes (with hole growth rate ranging from 1.2 to 1.4

Internet of Things. Furthermore, industrial applications increasingly rely on
communication through trust boundaries. Networking is cheap and easily
applicable while providing the possibility to make everyday life more easy and
comfortable and industry more efficient and less time-consuming. One of the
crucial parts of this interconnected world is sound and secure authentication
of entities. Only entities with valid authorisation should be enabled to act on
a resource according to an access control scheme. An overview of challenges and
practices of authentication is provided in this work, with a special focus on
context information as part of security solutions. It can be used for
authentication and security solutions in industrial applications. Additional
information about events in networks can aid intrusion detection, especially in
combination with security information and event management systems. Finally, an
authentication and access control approach, based on context information and -
depending on the scenario - multiple factors is presented. The combination of
multiple factors with context information makes it secure and at the same time
case adaptive, so that the effort always matches, but never exceeds, the
security demand. This is a common issue of standard cyber security, entities
having to obey strict, inflexible and unhandy policies. This approach has been
implemented exemplary based on RADIUS. Different scenarios were considered,
showing that this approach is capable of providing flexible and scalable
security for authentication processes.

this paper designs an assistant controller using fuzzy PID control, and

less than 45 minutes. Using incident baseline information, we first deploy a
classification method using various ensemble tree models in order to predict
whether a new incident will be cleared in less than 45min or not. If the
incident was classified as short-term, then various regression models are
developed for predicting the actual incident duration in minutes by
incorporating various traffic flow features. After outlier removal and
intensive model hyper-parameter tuning through randomized search and
cross-validation, we show that the extreme gradient boost approach outperformed
all models, including the gradient-boosted decision-trees by almost 53%.
Finally, we perform a feature importance evaluation for incident duration

G181.84 and are well traced by HCO$^{+}$(1-0) and N$_{2}$H$^{+}$(1-0)
spectral-line emission. We find signatures of sequential star formation
activities in G181.84: dense cores and YSOs located in the northern and
southern sub-structures are younger than those in the central region. We also
detect global velocity gradients of about 0.8$\pm$0.05 km s$^{-1}$pc$^{-1}$ and
1.0$\pm$0.05 km s$^{-1}$pc$^{-1}$ along the northern and southern
sub-structures, respectively, and local velocity gradients of 1.2$\pm$0.1 km
s$^{-1}$pc$^{-1}$ in the central substructure. These results may be due to the
fact that the global collapse of the extended filamentary structure S242 is
driven by an edge effect, for which the filament edges collapse first and then
further trigger star formation activities inward. We identify three
substructures in G181.84 and estimate their critical masses per unit length,
which are $\sim$ 101$\pm$15 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$, 56$\pm$8 M$_{\odot}$
pc$^{-1}$ and 28$\pm$4 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$, respectively. These values are
all lower than the observed values ($\sim$ 200 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$),
suggesting that these sub-structures are gravitationally unstable.

between a resonant state and a bound state, and that between two resonant

pre-dictions on test examples that are distributionally different from training

approach to this challenge is to pre-train a model on related tasks where data
is abundant, and then fine-tune it on a downstream task of interest. While
pre-training has been effective in many language and vision domains, it remains
an open question how to effectively use pre-training on graph datasets. In this
paper, we develop a new strategy and self-supervised methods for pre-training
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The key to the success of our strategy is to
pre-train an expressive GNN at the level of individual nodes as well as entire
graphs so that the GNN can learn useful local and global representations
simultaneously. We systematically study pre-training on multiple graph
classification datasets. We find that naive strategies, which pre-train GNNs at
the level of either entire graphs or individual nodes, give limited improvement

our strategy avoids negative transfer and improves generalization significantly
across downstream tasks, leading up to 9.4% absolute improvements in ROC-AUC
over non-pre-trained models and achieving state-of-the-art performance for
molecular property prediction and protein function prediction.

growth in the early universe may precede the prolonged intense star formation
within its host galaxy, instead of quasars appearing after the obscured dusty
star formation phase. If so, high-redshift quasars with low Eddington ratios
($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$) would be found in actively star-forming hosts with a star
formation rate (SFR) of $>100~M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We present the sub-mm
observations of IMS J2204+0112, a faint quasar with a quasar bolometric
luminosity of $L_{\rm bol}=4.2\times10^{12}~L_{\odot}$ and a low $\lambda_{\rm
Edd}$ of only 0.1 at $z\sim6$, carried out with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). From its sub-mm fluxes, we measure the
rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) luminosity of $L_{\rm
FIR}=(3$--$4)\times10^{12}~L_{\odot}$. Interestingly, the derived host galaxy's
SFR is $\sim500$--$700~M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, an order of magnitude higher than
those of the $L_{\rm bol}$-matched $z\gtrsim6$ quasars with high $\lambda_{\rm
Edd}$. Similar FIR excesses are also found for five $z\gtrsim6$
low-$\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ quasars ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}<0.2$) in the literature. We
show that the overall SFR, $M_{\rm BH}$, and $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ distributions
of these and other sub-mm-detected quasars at $z\gtrsim6$ can be explained with
the evolutionary track of high-redshift quasars in a simulation study where low
$\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ and high SFR quasars are expected at the end of the SMBH
growth. This suggests that the nuclear activities of the low $\lambda_{\rm
Edd}$, high $L_{\rm FIR}$ quasars are on the brink of being turned off, while
their host galaxies continue to form the bulk of their stars at SFR
$>100~M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.

mechanisms such as free-free, synchrotron, thermal dust, and AME arising from
electric dipole emission from rapidly rotating dust grains, we found that the
overall emission from M31 is dominated, at frequencies below 10GHz, by
synchrotron emission with a spectral index of -1.10+0.10-0.08, with subdominant
free-free emission. At frequencies >10GHz, AME has a similar intensity to that
of synchrotron and free-free emission, overtaking them between 20GHz and 50GHz,
whereas thermal dust emission dominates the emission budget at frequencies
above 60GHz, as expected.

the OOV problem in sequence labeling using only training data of the task. To
this end, we propose a novel method to predict representations for OOV words
from their surface-forms (e.g., character sequence) and contexts. The method is
specifically designed to avoid the error propagation problem suffered by
existing approaches in the same paradigm. To evaluate its effectiveness, we
performed extensive empirical studies on four part-of-speech tagging (POS)
tasks and four named entity recognition (NER) tasks. Experimental results show
that the proposed method can achieve better or competitive performance on the
OOV problem compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.

spurious stationary points never discussed before. We address this issue by
providing a theoretical framework around the new idea of $D$-criticality; we
then give a simple asymptotic analysis of INNA. Our algorithm allows for using
an aggressive learning rate of $o(1/\log k)$. From an empirical viewpoint, we

commonly-used method of data fusion but does not consider the heterogeneity of
multimodal optical images and OSM data, which becomes its main drawback. The
proposed framework processes two data sources separately and then combines them
at the model level through two fusion models (the landuse fusion model and
building fusion model), which aim to fuse optical images with landuse and
buildings layers of OSM data, respectively. In addition, a new approach to
detecting building incompleteness of OSM data is proposed. The proposed
framework was trained and tested using data from the 2017 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion
Contest, and further validated on one additional test set containing test
samples which are manually labeled in Munich and New York. Experimental results
have indicated that compared to the feature stacking-based baseline framework
the proposed framework is effective in fusing optical images with OSM data for
the classification of LCZs with high generalization capability on a large
scale. The classification accuracy of the proposed framework outperforms the
baseline framework by more than 6% and 2%, while testing on the test set of
2017 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest and the additional test set, respectively.
In addition, the proposed framework is less sensitive to spectral diversities
of optical satellite images and thus achieves more stable classification
performance than state-of-the art frameworks.

paper, we propose a novel algorithm called Action-Guided Adversarial Imitation

separate demonstrations into state and action trajectories, and train a policy
with state trajectories while using actions as auxiliary information to guide
the training whenever applicable. Built upon the Generative Adversarial
Imitation Learning, AGAIL has three components: a generator, a discriminator,
and a guide. The generator learns a policy with rewards provided by the
discriminator, which tries to distinguish state distributions between
demonstrations and samples generated by the policy. The guide provides
additional rewards to the generator when demonstrated actions for specific
states are available. We compare AGAIL to other methods on benchmark tasks and
show that AGAIL consistently delivers comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art methods even when the action sequence in demonstrations is
only partially available.

on the data. Particularly, convolutions in convolutional neural networks
discard phase information entirely. Many deterministic signals, such as seismic
data or electrical signals, contain significant information in the phase of the
signal. We explore complex-valued deep convolutional networks to leverage
non-linear feature maps. Seismic data commonly has a lowcut filter applied, to
attenuate noise from ocean waves and similar long wavelength contributions.
Discarding the phase information leads to low-frequency aliasing analogous to
the Nyquist-Shannon theorem for high frequencies. In non-stationary data, the
phase content can stabilize training and improve the generalizability of neural
networks. While it has been shown that phase content can be restored in deep
neural networks, we show how including phase information in feature maps
improves both training and inference from deterministic physical data.
Furthermore, we show that the reduction of parameters in a complex network
outperforms larger real-valued networks.

is attractive for Deep Learning training for two reasons: the range of values

and conversion to/from FP32 is simple. Maintaining the same range as FP32 is
important to ensure that no hyper-parameter tuning is required for convergence;

electromagnetic field distributions at the nanoscale using tightly focused

a neighborhood of the actual preferences. (2) CoarsenRank then performs regular
RAs over a neighborhood of the preferences instead of the original dataset
directly. Therefore, CoarsenRank enjoys robustness against model
misspecification within a neighborhood. (3) The neighborhood of the dataset is
defined via their empirical data distributions. Further, we put an exponential
prior on the unknown size of the neighborhood, and derive a much-simplified
posterior formula for CoarsenRank under particular divergence measures. (4)
CoarsenRank is further instantiated to Coarsened Thurstone, Coarsened
Bradly-Terry, and Coarsened Plackett-Luce with three popular probability
ranking models. Meanwhile, tractable optimization strategies are introduced
with regards to each instantiation respectively. In the end, we apply
CoarsenRank on four real-world datasets.

the success of OMP is often formulated as exactly recovering the support of the

recovery by OMP with high probability depending on the signal-to-noise ratio,
defined as the magnitude of the smallest non-zero coefficient of the vector

slightly sharper sufficient condition for two variants of OMP, in which either
the sparsity level or the noise level is known. Next, we show that this sharper
sufficient condition is tight, in the following sense: for a wide range of
problem parameters, there exist a dictionary of linear measurements and a
sparse vector with a signal-to-noise ratio slightly below that of the
sufficient condition, for which with high probability OMP fails to recover its
support. Finally, we present simulations which illustrate that our condition is
tight for a much broader range of dictionaries.

seconds. The effective isolation level is Read-Committed, only revealing state
transitions at the end of the block interval. Values read may be stale and not
match program order, causing many transactions to fail when a block is
committed. This paper perceives the blockchain as a transactional data
structure, using this analogy in the development of a new algorithm,
Hash-Mark-Set (HMS), that improves transaction throughput by providing a
Read-Uncommitted view of state variables. HMS creates a directed acyclic graph
(DAG) from the pending transaction pool. The transaction order derived from the
DAG is used to provide a Read-Uncommitted view of the data for new
transactions, which enter the DAG as they are received. An implementation of
HMS is provided, interoperable with Ethereum and ready for use in smart
contracts. Over a wide range of transaction mixes, HMS is demonstrated to
improve throughput. A side product of the implementation is a new technique,
Runtime Argument Augmentation (RAA), that allows smart contracts to communicate
with external data services before submitting a transaction. RAA has use cases
beyond HMS and can serve as a lightweight replacement for blockchain oracles.

the interior of the $i$th region $D_i$, and behave consistently on the boundary
between different regions. Our main result asserts that if such a system is
nonexpansive (i.e., if the Euclidean distance between any pair of trajectories
is a nonincreasing function of time), then the system must be conservative,
i.e., its trajectories are the same as the trajectories of the negative
subgradient flow associated with a potential function. Furthermore, this
potential function is necessarily convex, and is linear on each of the regions

seemingly weaker assumptions on the dynamical system of interest.

tunability of the properties can be also achieved by the surface ligands. In
particular, covalently bonded ligand species on the surface of such a
nanocrystal (i) contribute to the density of states of the core via orbital
delocalization; (ii) might introduce strain via ligand-to-ligand steric

we study all these effects on silicon nanocrystals (SiNCs). We analyze
geometrically optimized ~ 2 nm SiNCs with electronegative organic ligands using

enhanced by electronegative alkyl and fluorocarbon with respect to what is

detrimental to the rate enhancement, contrary to the positive effects of the

  We show that the results are different for superpositions that are created

dynamical superpositions we have found that the observable related to the
topological number is non-integer indeed. For static superpositions the
resulting bands bear integer topological numbers. We illustrate how the number
quantization is restored upon avoided crossing of topologically distinct
subbands. The crossings lead to the exchange of topological numbers between the

degree of agreement between expert EEG readers, with kappa coefficients ranging

variability in visual scoring of neonatal seizures may be due to factors such
as reader expertise and the nature of expressed patterns. One of the possible
reasons for low inter-rater agreement is the absence of any benchmark for the
EEG readers to be able to compare their opinions. One way to develop this is to
use a shared multi-center neonatal seizure database and use the inputs from
multiple experts. This will also improve the teaching of trainees, and help to
avoid potential bias from a single expert's opinion. In this paper, we
introduce and explain the NeoGuard public learning platform that can be used by
trainees, tutors, and expert EEG readers who are interested to test their
knowledge and learn from neonatal EEG-polygraphic segments scored by several

tens of micrometers over a fiber length of more than half a millimeter. Our
method relies on taking an image of the fiber's whispering-gallery modes
(WGMs). In these WGMs, the speed of light propagating along the fiber axis is
strongly reduced. This enables us to determine the fiber radius with a
significantly enhanced precision, far beyond the diffraction limit. By exciting
different axial modes, we verify the precision and reproducibility of our
method and demonstrate that we can achieve a precision better than 0.3 \AA. The
method can be generalized to other experimental situations where slow light
occurs and, thus, has a large range of potential applications in the realm of
precision metrology and optical sensing.

the challenging task of inpainting missing regions of an image. However, the
existing methods often generate contents with blurry textures and distorted
structures due to the discontinuity of the local pixels. From a semantic-level
perspective, the local pixel discontinuity is mainly because these methods
ignore the semantic relevance and feature continuity of hole regions. To handle
this problem, we investigate the human behavior in repairing pictures and
propose a fined deep generative model-based approach with a novel coherent
semantic attention (CSA) layer, which can not only preserve contextual
structure but also make more effective predictions of missing parts by modeling
the semantic relevance between the holes features. The task is divided into
rough, refinement as two steps and model each step with a neural network under
the U-Net architecture, where the CSA layer is embedded into the encoder of
refinement step. To stabilize the network training process and promote the CSA
layer to learn more effective parameters, we propose a consistency loss to
enforce the both the CSA layer and the corresponding layer of the CSA in
decoder to be close to the VGG feature layer of a ground truth image
simultaneously. The experiments on CelebA, Places2, and Paris StreetView
datasets have validated the effectiveness of our proposed methods in image
inpainting tasks and can obtain images with a higher quality as compared with
the existing state-of-the-art approaches.

very popular and widely explored type of dimensionality reduction is sparsity;
another type is generative modelling of signal distributions. Generative models
based on neural networks, such as GANs or variational auto-encoders, are
particularly performant and are gaining on applicability. In this paper we
study spiked matrix models, where a low-rank matrix is observed through a noisy
channel. This problem with sparse structure of the spikes has attracted broad
attention in the past literature. Here, we replace the sparsity assumption by
generative modelling, and investigate the consequences on statistical and
algorithmic properties. We analyze the Bayes-optimal performance under specific
generative models for the spike. In contrast with the sparsity assumption, we
do not observe regions of parameters where statistical performance is superior
to the best known algorithmic performance. We show that in the analyzed cases
the approximate message passing algorithm is able to reach optimal performance.
We also design enhanced spectral algorithms and analyze their performance and
thresholds using random matrix theory, showing their superiority to the
classical principal component analysis. We complement our theoretical results
by illustrating the performance of the spectral algorithms when the spikes come

by oceans works differently from that of the present-day Earth because
inefficient erosion leads to a strong dependence of the weathering rate on the
rate of volcanism. In this paper, we investigate the long-term carbon cycle for
these planets throughout their evolution. Methods: We built box models of the
long-term carbon cycle based on CO$_2$ degassing, seafloor-weathering,
metamorphic decarbonation, and ingassing and coupled them with thermal
evolution models of stagnant lid and plate tectonics planets. Results: The
assumed relationship between the seafloor-weathering rate and the atmospheric
CO$_2$ or the surface temperature strongly influences the climate evolution for
both tectonic regimes. For a plate tectonics planet, the atmospheric CO$_2$
partial pressure is characterised by an equilibrium between ingassing and
degassing and depends on the temperature gradient in subduction zones affecting
the stability of carbonates. For a stagnant lid planet, partial melting and
degassing are always accompanied by decarbonation, such that the combined
carbon content of the crust and atmosphere increases with time. Whereas the
initial mantle temperature for plate tectonics planets only affects the early
evolution, it influences the evolution of the surface temperature of stagnant
lid planets for much longer. Conclusions: For both tectonic regimes, mantle
cooling results in a decreasing atmospheric CO$_2$ partial pressure. For a
plate tectonics planet this is caused by an increasing fraction of subduction
zones that avoid crustal decarbonation, and for stagnant lid planets this is
caused by an increasing decarbonation depth. This mechanism may partly
compensate for the increase of the surface temperature due to increasing solar
luminosity with time and hereby contribute to keep planets habitable in the
long-term.

may have far-reaching consequences, as it may provide a mechanism for abrupt

a wave-jet resonance feedback. We delineate the regime of applicability of
these two mechanisms in a simple model of zonal acceleration budget at the

first extracted in every frame and person trajectories are then recovered by a
procedure of data association (usually offline). However, their performances
usually degenerate in presence of detection errors, mutual interactions and
occlusions. In this paper, we present a deep learning based MPT approach that
learns instance-aware representations of tracked persons and robustly online
infers states of the tracked persons. Specifically, we design a multi-branch
neural network (MBN), which predicts the classification confidences and
locations of all targets by taking a batch of candidate regions as input. In
our MBN architecture, each branch (instance-subnet) corresponds to an
individual to be tracked and new branches can be dynamically created for
handling newly appearing persons. Then based on the output of MBN, we construct
a joint association matrix that represents meaningful states of tracked persons
(e.g., being tracked or disappearing from the scene) and solve it by using the
efficient Hungarian algorithm. Moreover, we allow the instance-subnets to be

agricultural data are usually collected through various sources, such as:
Internet of Thing (IoT), sensors, satellites, weather stations, robots, farm
equipment, farmers and agribusinesses, etc. Besides, agricultural datasets are
very large, complex, unstructured, heterogeneous, non-standardized, and
inconsistent. Hence, the agricultural data mining is considered as Big Data
application in terms of volume, variety, velocity and veracity. It is a key
foundation to establishing a crop intelligence platform, which will enable
resource efficient agronomy decision making and recommendations. In this paper,
we designed and implemented a continental level agricultural data warehouse by
combining Hive, MongoDB and Cassandra. Our data warehouse capabilities: (1)
flexible schema; (2) data integration from real agricultural multi datasets;
(3) data science and business intelligent support; (4) high performance; (5)
high storage; (6) security; (7) governance and monitoring; (8) replication and

cells) establish a highly organized contact zone denoted as immunological
synapse (IS). The formation of the IS implies relocation of the microtubule
organizing center (MTOC) towards the contact zone, which necessitates a proper
connection between MTOC and IS via dynamic microtubules (MTs). The efficiency
of the MTs finding the IS within relevant time scale is, however, still
illusive. We investigate how MTs search the three-dimensional constrained
cellular volume for the IS and bind upon encounter to dynein anchored at the IS
cortex. The search efficiency is estimated by calculating the time required for
the MTs to reach the dynein-enriched region of the IS. In this study, we
develop simple mathematical and numerical models incorporating relevant
components of a cell and propose an optimal search strategy. Using the
mathematical model, we have quantified the average search time for a wide range
of model parameters and proposed an optimized set of values leading to the
minimum capture time. Our results show that search times are minimal when the
IS formed at the nearest or at the farthest sites on the cell surface, with
respect to the perinuclear MTOC. The search time increases monotonically away
from these two specific sites and are maximal at an intermediate position near
the equator of the cell. We observed that search time strongly depends on the
number of searching MTs and distance of the MTOC from the nuclear surface.

improvements over the state of the art. (1) Our bounds have no explicit

even when formulating the bounds in terms of the $L^2$-norm of the weight
matrices, where previous bounds exhibit at least a square-root dependence on
the number of classes. (2) We adapt the classic Rademacher analysis of DNNs to
incorporate weight sharing -- a task of fundamental theoretical importance

results, each convolutional filter contributes only once to the bound,
regardless of how many times it is applied. Further improvements exploiting
pooling and sparse connections are provided. The presented bounds scale as the
norms of the parameter matrices, rather than the number of parameters. In
particular, contrary to bounds based on parameter counting, they are
asymptotically tight (up to log factors) when the weights approach
initialisation, making them suitable as a basic ingredient in bounds sensitive
to the optimisation procedure. We also show how to adapt the recent technique
of loss function augmentation to our situation to replace spectral norms by
empirical analogues whilst maintaining the advantages of our approach.

dynamical model of banking system. In the model considered each bank is
represented by its assets and its liabilities.The capital reserves of a bank
are the difference between assets and liabilities of the bank. A bank is
solvent when its capital reserves are greater or equal to zero otherwise the
bank is failed.The banking system dynamics is defined by an initial value
problem for a system of stochastic differential equations whose independent
variable is time and whose dependent variables are the assets and the
liabilities of the banks.The banking system model presented generalizes those
discussed in [4],[3] and describes a homogeneous population of banks. The main
features of the model are a cooperation mechanism among banks and the
possibility of the (direct) intervention of the monetary authority in the
banking system dynamics. We call systemic risk or systemic event in a bounded
time interval the fact that in that time interval at least a given fraction of
the banks fails. The probability of systemic risk in a bounded time interval is
evaluated using statistical simulation. The systemic risk governance pursues
the goal of keeping the probability of systemic risk in a bounded time interval
between two given thresholds.The monetary authority is responsible for the
systemic risk governance.The governance consists in the choice of the assets
and of the liabilities of a kind of ""ideal bank"" as functions of time and in
the choice of the rules that regulate the cooperation mechanism among
banks.These rules are obtained solving an optimal control problem for the
pseudo mean field approximation of the banking system model. The governance
induces the banks of the system to behave like the ""ideal bank"". Shocks acting
on the assets or on the liabilities of the banks are simulated.

models, the observable non-Gaussianity put strong constraints on the decay
epoch of curvaton as well as on its field value around the horizon exit.
Besides, it can also explain the observed red-tilt in the spectrum as a
consequence of its negative mass-squared value. As for the runaway inflationary
models, curvaton by sudden decay into the background radiation provides an
efficient reheating mechanism, whereas the inflaton rolls down from its
potential and enters into the kinetic regime. To this effect, we consider the
generalized exponential potential and obtain the allowed parametric space for

results to quantify the programs' functional correctness. They return failing
tests to the students as feedback. However, students may find it difficult to
debug their programs if they receive no hints about where the bug is and how to
fix it. In this work, we present the first deep learning based technique that
can localize bugs in a faulty program w.r.t. a failing test, without even
running the program. At the heart of our technique is a novel tree
convolutional neural network which is trained to predict whether a program
passes or fails a given test. To localize the bugs, we analyze the trained
network using a state-of-the-art neural prediction attribution technique and
see which lines of the programs make it predict the test outcomes. Our
experiments show that the proposed technique is generally more accurate than
two state-of-the-art program-spectrum based and one syntactic difference based
bug-localization baselines.

adversary has strong incentive to explore vulnerabilities of deep neural

have been reported to be a new type of threat. In this attack, the adversary
will inject backdoors into the model and then cause the misbehavior of the
model through inputs including backdoor triggers. Existed research mainly
focuses on backdoor attacks in image classification based on CNN, little
attention has been paid to the backdoor attacks in RNN. In this paper, we
implement a backdoor attack in text classification based on LSTM by data
poisoning. When the backdoor is injected, the model will misclassify any text
samples that contains a specific trigger sentence into the target category
determined by the adversary. The existence of the backdoor trigger is stealthy
and the backdoor injected has little impact on the performance of the model. We
consider the backdoor attack in black-box setting where the adversary has no
knowledge of model structures or training algorithms except for small amount of
training data. We verify the attack through sentiment analysis on the dataset
of IMDB movie reviews. The experimental results indicate that our attack can
achieve around 95% success rate with 1% poisoning rate.

where the fermionic DM interacts with the nucleons via Higgs portal. Presence
of DM can hardly influence the particle distribution inside neutron star (NS)
but can significantly affect the structure as well as equation of state (EOS)
of NS. Introduction of DM inside NS softens the equation of state. We explored
the effect of variation of DM mass and DM Fermi momentum on the NS EOS.
Moreover, DM-Higgs coupling is constrained using dark matter direct detection
experiments. Then, we studied cooling of normal NSs using APR and DD2 EOSs and
DM admixed NSs using dark-matter modified DD2 with varying DM mass and Fermi
momentum. We have done our analysis by considering different NS masses. Also DM
mass and DM Fermi momentum are varied for fixed NS mass and DM-Higgs coupling.
We calculated the variations of luminosity and temperature of NS with time for
all EOSs considered in our work and then compared our calculations with the
observed astronomical cooling data of pulsars namely Cas A, RX J0822-43, 1E
1207-52, RX J0002+62, XMMU J17328, PSR B1706-44, Vela, PSR B2334+61, PSR
B0656+14, Geminga, PSR B1055-52 and RX J0720.4-3125. It is found that APR EOS
agrees well with the pulsar data for lighter and medium mass NSs but cooling is
very fast for heavier NS. For DM admixed DD2 EOS, it is found that for all
considered NS masses, all chosen DM masses and Fermi momenta agree well with
the observational data of PSR B0656+14, Geminga, Vela, PSR B1706-44 and PSR
B2334+61. Cooling becomes faster as compared to normal NSs in case of
increasing DM mass and Fermi momenta. It is infered from the calculations that
if low mass super cold NSs are observed in future that may support the fact
that heavier WIMP can be present inside neutron stars.

H$\beta$ in the atmosphere of MASCARA-2b, and indications of H$\gamma$ and MgI
at low SNR. The results obtained with CARMENES and HARPS-N are consistent,
measuring an H$\alpha$ absorption depth of $0.68\pm0.05\%$ and $0.59\pm0.07\%$,
and NaI absorption of $0.11\pm0.04\%$ and $0.09\pm0.05\%$ ($0.75\r{A}$

this wavelength range, measuring $0.28\pm0.06\%$ of absorption. The CaII is

Three additional FeII lines are observed in the transmission spectrum by
HARPS-N, with mean absorption depth of $0.08\pm0.04\%$. The results presented
here are consistent with theoretical models of ultra hot Jupiters atmospheres,
suggesting the emergence of an ionised gas on the day-side of such planets. Ca

model simulations are one of the most important ways to investigate this
subject. It is known that a strong magnetic field can be created in heavy ion
collisions. However, its effect on the motion of charged particles is usually
neglected in previous transport model simulations. In this work, within the
Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model, the temporal
evolution and spatial distribution of the internal magnetic field are
calculated. The magnetic field strength is found to reach about $eB\approx470$
MeV$^{2}$ ($B\approx8\times10^{16}$ G) for Au+Au collisions at
$E_{\text{lab}}$=1 GeV/nucleon with impact parameter of 7 fm. The magnetic
field in Cu+Au collisions exhibits somewhat different spatial distribution from
that in Au+Au collisions. The magnetic field is found to affect the directed
flow of pions at forward and backward rapidities to some extent, dependent of
the impact parameter and beam energy while the effect on the elliptic flow is
small. This suggests that, because $\pi$ mesons produced in heavy ion
collisions at intermediate energies are considered as a sensitive probe for the
nuclear symmetry energy, it is necessary to consider the effect of the internal
magnetic field.

the initial phase of a dissolution process of CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ (MAPbI$_3$)

complex multi-step process triggered by the departure of I$^-$ ion from the

The low energy barrier for the initial dissolution step and the spontaneous

destroys pristine MAPbI$_3$. The dissolution thermodynamics of all-inorganic

The precise determination of the present-day expansion rate of the
Universe, expressed through the Hubble constant $H_0$, is one of the most
pressing challenges in modern cosmology. Assuming flat $\Lambda$CDM, $H_0$
inference at high redshift using cosmic-microwave-background data from Planck
disagrees at the 4.4$\sigma$ level with measurements based on the local
distance ladder made up of parallaxes, Cepheids and Type Ia supernovae (SNe
Ia), often referred to as ""Hubble tension"". Independent,
cosmological-model-insensitive ways to infer $H_0$ are of critical importance.
Aims. We apply an inverse-distance-ladder approach, combining strong-lensing
time-delay-distance measurements with SN Ia data. By themselves, SNe Ia are
merely good relative distance indicators, but by anchoring them to strong
gravitational lenses one can obtain an $H_0$ measurement that is relatively
insensitive to other cosmological parameters. Methods. A cosmological parameter
estimate is performed for different cosmological background models, both for
strong-lensing data alone and for the combined lensing + SNe Ia data sets.
Results. The cosmological-model dependence of strong-lensing $H_0$ measurements
is significantly mitigated through the inverse distance ladder. In combination
with SN Ia data, the inferred $H_0$ consistently lies around 73-74 km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$, regardless of the assumed cosmological background model. Our
results agree nicely with those from the local distance ladder, but there is a
>2$\sigma$ tension with Planck results, and a ~1.5$\sigma$ discrepancy with
results from an inverse distance ladder including Planck, Baryon Acoustic
Oscillations and SNe Ia. Future strong-lensing distance measurements will
reduce the uncertainties in $H_0$ from our inverse distance ladder.

spatial resolution is limited by the wavelength of the visible sum-frequency

subdiffractional nanostructures made of 4H-silicon carbide supporting localized
surface phonon polaritons. By spatially scanning tightly focused incident
beams, we observe excellent sensitivity of the sum-frequency signal to the
resonant polaritonic field enhancement, with a much improved spatial resolution
determined by visible laser focal size. However, we report that the tight
focusing can also induce sample damage, ultimately limiting the achievable

overcoming this limitation, we discuss the concept of using wide-field
sum-frequency generation microscopy as a universal experimental tool that would

the other discriminates between synthetic and real images. The motivation of
this study is to create new fonts using the GAN framework while maintaining
style consistency over all characters. In GlyphGAN, the input vector for the
generator network consists of two vectors: character class vector and style
vector. The former is a one-hot vector and is associated with the character
class of each sample image during training. The latter is a uniform random
vector without supervised information. In this way, GlyphGAN can generate an
infinite variety of fonts with the character and style independently
controlled. Experimental results showed that fonts generated by GlyphGAN have
style consistency and diversity different from the training images without
losing their legibility.

to compare these phase curves with those of tentatively analog dust samples to

Light-scattering measurements have been made with the PROGRA2 instrument in the
laboratory and in microgravity conditions on samples of different physical
properties and compositions that are likely to be representative of cometary
dust particles. Results: We find that the brightness phase curves of a series
of interplanetary dust analogs that have been recently developed (to fit the
polarimetric properties of the inner zodiacal cloud and their changes with
heliocentric distance) are quite comparable to those of 67P. Key dust
properties seem to be related to the composition and the porosity. Conclusions:
We conclude that the shape of the brightness phase curves of 67P has to be
related to the presence of a significant amount of organic compounds (at least
50% in mass) and of fluffy aggregates (of a size range of 10 to 200 microns).
We also confirm similarities between the dust particles of this Jupiter-family

are not decomposable, that is, they cannot be expressed in a per-example

which are a family of classification performance metrics that encompasses many
standard ones such as the F${}_\beta$-measure and Jaccard index, and propose
methods to directly maximize performances under those metrics. A clue to tackle
their direct optimization is a calibrated surrogate utility, which is a
tractable lower bound of the true utility function representing a given metric.
We characterize sufficient conditions which make the surrogate maximization
coincide with the maximization of the true utility. Simulation results on
benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our calibrated surrogate
maximization especially if the sample sizes are extremely small.

cooperative networks. In contrast to most previous works, where the guidelines
for BRS are limited to Gaussian noise, in this article, we propose a novel
relay selection protocol for a decode-and-forward cooperative network taking
into account the bursty impulsive noise (IN). The proposed protocol chooses the
N'th best relay considering both the channel gains and the states of the IN of
the source-relay and relay-destination links. For this scheme, to obtain the
state of IN, we propose a state detection algorithm using maximum a posteriori
(MAP) detection. To analyze the performance of the proposed protocol, we first
derive closed-form expressions for the probability density function (PDF) of
the received signal-to-noise ratio assuming all the relays know the state of IN
perfectly (genie-condition). Then, these PDFs are used to derive closed-form
expressions for the bit error rate (BER) and the outage probability. Finally,
we also derive the asymptotic BER and outage expressions to quantify the
diversity benefits. We show that the proposed MAP-based N'th BRS protocol
attains the derived genie-aided analytical results and outperforms the
conventional relay selection protocol, optimized for the Gaussian case, and
which does not take into account the IN memory.

combination of these regularizers that is as good as the best regularizer in
the family. Our theory reveals that if the Tikhonov regularizers share the same
penalty matrix with different tuning parameters, a convex procedure based on
$Q$-aggregation achieves the mean square error of the best estimator, up to a
small error term no larger than $C\sigma^2$, where $\sigma^2$ is the noise
level and $C>0$ is an absolute constant. Remarkably, the error term does not
depend on the penalty matrix or the number of estimators as long as they share
the same penalty matrix, i.e., it applies to any grid of tuning parameters, no
matter how large the cardinality of the grid is. This reveals the surprising
""cost-free"" nature of optimally tuning Tikhonov regularizers, in striking
contrast with the existing literature on aggregation of estimators where one
typically has to pay a cost of $\sigma^2\log(M)$ where $M$ is the number of
estimators in the family. The result holds, more generally, for any family of

Principal Component Regression. The result is extended to the problem of tuning

reference source in ground-based gamma-ray astronomy, using data from the High
Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Gamma-Ray Observatory. In this analysis we use
two independent energy-estimation methods that utilize extensive air shower
variables such as the core position, shower angle, and shower lateral energy
distribution. In contrast, the previously published HAWC energy spectrum
roughly estimated the shower energy with only the number of photomultipliers
triggered. This new methodology yields a much improved energy resolution over
the previous analysis and extends HAWC's ability to accurately measure
gamma-ray energies well beyond 100 TeV. The energy spectrum of the Crab Nebula
is well fit to a log parabola shape $\left(\frac{dN}{dE} = \phi_0
\left(E/\textrm{7 TeV}\right)^{-\alpha-\beta\ln\left(E/\textrm{7
TeV}\right)}\right)$ with emission up to at least 100 TeV. For the first
estimator, a ground parameter that utilizes fits to the lateral distribution
function to measure the charge density 40 meters from the shower axis, the
best-fit values are
$\phi_o$=(2.35$\pm$0.04$^{+0.20}_{-0.21}$)$\times$10$^{-13}$ (TeV cm$^2$
s)$^{-1}$, $\alpha$=2.79$\pm$0.02$^{+0.01}_{-0.03}$, and
$\beta$=0.10$\pm$0.01$^{+0.01}_{-0.03}$. For the second estimator, a neural
network which uses the charge distribution in annuli around the core and other
variables, these values are
$\phi_o$=(2.31$\pm$0.02$^{+0.32}_{-0.17}$)$\times$10$^{-13}$ (TeV cm$^2$

$\beta$=0.06$\pm$0.01$\pm$0.02. The first set of uncertainties are statistical;
the second set are systematic. Both methods yield compatible results. These

bandgaps and simple composition is attractive for both theoretical
investigation and experimental realization. Recently alpha tin ({\alpha}-Sn)
has been predicted to be such a candidate and it can be tuned to be either a
topological insulator or a Dirac semimetal by applying appropriate strain.
However, free-standing {\alpha}-Sn is only stable below 13.2 {\deg}C. In this
study, a series of high-quality {\alpha}-Sn films with different thicknesses
have been successfully grown on InSb substrates by molecular beam epitaxy
(MBE). Confirmed by both X-ray diffraction (XRD) and reciprocal space mapping
(RSM), all the films remained fully strained up to 4000 {\AA}, proving the
strain effect from the substrate. Remarkably, the single-crystalline {\alpha}
phase can persist up to 170 {\deg}C for the 200 {\AA} thick sample. The
critical temperature where the {\alpha} phase disappears decreases as the film
thickness increases, showing the thermal stabilization can be engineered by
varying the {\alpha}-Sn thickness. A plastic flow model taking the work
hardening into account is introduced to explain this dependence, assuming the
strain relaxation and the phase transition occur successively. This enhanced
thermal stability is prerequisite for above room-temperature characterization
and application of this material system.

mas thanks to Gaia DR2. Between 2019-2020, the Galactic plane will be the
background of Jupiter. The dense stellar background will lead to an increase in
the number of occultations, while the Gaia DR2 catalogue will reduce the
prediction uncertainties for the shadow path.
  Aims. We observed a stellar occultation by the Galilean moon Europa (J2) and
propose a campaign for observing stellar occultations for all Galilean moons.
  Methods. During a predicted period of time, we measured the light flux of the
occulted star and the object to determine the time when the flux dropped with
respect to one or more reference stars, and the time that it rose again for
each observational station. The chords obtained from these observations allowed
us to determine apparent sizes, oblatness, and positions with kilometre
accuracy.
  Results. We present results obtained from the first stellar occultation by
the Galilean moon Europa observed on 2017 March 31. The apparent fitted ellipse
presents an equivalent radius of 1561.2 $\pm$ 3.6 km and oblatenesses 0.0010
$\pm$ 0.0028. A very precise Europa position was determined with an uncertainty
of 0.8 mas. We also present prospects for a campaign to observe the future
events that will occur between 2019 and 2021 for all Galilean moons.
  Conclusions. Stellar occultation is a suitable technique for obtaining
physical parameters and highly accurate positions of bright satellites close to
their primary. A number of successful events can render the 3D shapes of the
Galilean moons with high accuracy. We encourage the observational community
(amateurs included) to observe the future predicted events.

treatment of the non-linear matrix space geometry, it is possible to deal with
the geometrically non-linear two-well problem within the framework outlined in

their simultaneous sensitivity to nuclear recoils from WIMP dark matter and

driven by a hot-spike as previously supposed. Using this semi-empirical model,
bubble chamber nucleation thresholds may be tuned to be sensitive to lower

The PICO-40L detector will exploit this model to achieve thermodynamic
thresholds as low as 2.8 keV while being dominated by single-scatter events
from coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering of solar neutrinos. In one
year of operation, PICO-40L can improve existing leading limits from PICO on
spin-dependent WIMP-proton coupling by nearly an order of magnitude for WIMP

large fraction of spurious correspondences. The second contribution is to
rewrite the problem using unit quaternions and show that the TLS cost can be
framed as a Quadratically-Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP). Since the
resulting optimization is still highly non-convex and hard to solve globally,
our third contribution is to develop a convex Semidefinite Programming (SDP)

our relaxation is tight even in the presence of large noise and outliers. We
validate the proposed algorithm, named QUASAR (QUAternion-based Semidefinite
relAxation for Robust alignment), in both synthetic and real datasets showing
that the algorithm outperforms RANSAC, robust local optimization techniques,
global outlier-removal procedures, and Branch-and-Bound methods. QUASAR is able

semiconductor lasers subject to large delayed feedbacks [B. Tykalewicz, et al.,
Opt. Express 24, 4239 (2016); B. Kelleher, et al., Chaos 27, 114325 (2017)].
Specifically, the relaxation oscillation (RO) frequency and a harmonic of the
feedback-loop round-trip frequency coincided with the ratios 1:5 to 1:11. By
analyzing the rate equations for the dynamical degrees of freedom in a laser
subject to a delayed optoelectronic feedback, we show that the onset of a
two-frequency train of pulses occurs through two successive bifurcations. While
the first bifurcation is a primary Hopf bifurcation to the ROs, a secondary
Hopf bifurcation leads to a two-frequency regime where a low frequency,
proportional to the inverse of the delay, is resonant with the RO frequency. We
derive an amplitude equation, valid near the first Hopf bifurcation point, and
numerically observe the frequency locking. We mathematically explain this
phenomenon by formulating a closed system of ordinary differential equations
from our amplitude equation. Our findings motivate new experiments with
particular attention to the first two bifurcations. We observe experimentally
(1) the frequency locking phenomenon as we pass the secondary bifurcation
point, and (2) the nearly constant slow period as the two-frequency
oscillations grow in amplitude. Our results analytically confirm previous
observations of frequency locking phenomena for lasers subject to a delayed
optical feedback.

equations to follow the evolution, in which we identify four generic stages: A
first, linear stage in which the instability grows exponentially; a second,
non-linear stage in which peaks and/or phase domains are formed; a third stage
in which these structures merge; and a fourth stage in which the system finally
relaxes to a static, phase-separated configuration. On the gravity side the
latter is described by a static, stable, inhomogeneous horizon. We conjecture
and provide evidence that all static, non-phase separated configurations in
large enough boxes are dynamically unstable. We show that all four stages are
well described by the constitutive relations of second-order hydrodynamics that
include all second-order gradients that are purely spatial in the local rest
frame. In contrast, a M\""uller-Israel-Stewart-type formulation of hydrodynamics
fails to provide a good description for two reasons. First, it misses some
large, purely-spatial gradient corrections. Second, several second-order
transport coefficients in this formulation, including the relaxation times

photometric time series. We calculate normalised amplitudes using all passbands

investigate the magnetic properties of beta Pic using spectropolarimetric
observations conducted with the HARPSpol instrument. Using 2D rotating models,
we fit the normalised amplitudes and frequencies through Monte Carlo Markov
Chains. We identify 15 pulsation frequencies in the range from 34 to 55c/d,
where two display clear amplitude variability. We use the normalised amplitudes
in up to five passbands to identify the modes as three l = 1, six l = 2 and six
l = 3 modes. beta Pic is shown to be non-magnetic with an upper limit of the
possible undetected dipolar field of 300G. Multiple fits to the frequencies and
normalised amplitudes are obtained including one with a near equator-on
inclination for beta Pic, which corresponds to our expectations based on the
orbital inclination of beta Pic b and the orientation of the circumstellar
disk. This solution leads to a rotation rate of 27% of the Keplerian break-up
velocity, a radius of 1.497+-0.025Rsun, and a mass of 1.797+-0.035Msun. The ~2%

they proved few essential properties of the OFT of real-valued functions, e.g.
symmetry properties. The results of this article focus on proving that the OFT
is well-defined for octonion-valued functions and almost all well-known
properties of classical (complex) Fourier transform (e.g. argument scaling,
modulation and shift theorems) have their direct equivalents in octonion setup.
Those theorems, illustrated with some examples, lead to the generalization of
another result presented in earlier work, i.e. Parseval and Plancherel
Theorems, important from the signal and system processing point of view.
Moreover, results presented in this paper associate the OFT with 3-D LTI
systems of linear PDEs with constant coefficients. Properties of the OFT in
context of signal-domain operations such as derivation and convolution of
$\mathbb{R}$-valued functions will be stated. There are known results for QFT,
but they use the notion of other hypercomplex algebra, i.e. double-complex
numbers. Considerations presented here require defining other higher-order
hypercomplex structure, i.e. quadruple-complex numbers. This hypercomplex
generalization of the Fourier transformation provides an excellent tool for the
analysis of 3-D LTI systems.

in medical images. Although supervised deep learning can perform accurate
segmentation of pathological areas, it is limited by requiring a-priori
definitions of these regions, large-scale annotations, and a representative
patient cohort in the training set. In contrast, anomaly detection is not
limited to specific definitions of pathologies and allows for training on
healthy samples without annotation. Anomalous regions can then serve as
candidates for biomarker discovery. Knowledge about normal anatomical structure
brings implicit information for detecting anomalies. We propose to take
advantage of this property using bayesian deep learning, based on the
assumption that epistemic uncertainties will correlate with anatomical
deviations from a normal training set. A Bayesian U-Net is trained on a
well-defined healthy environment using weak labels of healthy anatomy produced
by existing methods. At test time, we capture epistemic uncertainty estimates
of our model using Monte Carlo dropout. A novel post-processing technique is
then applied to exploit these estimates and transfer their layered appearance
to smooth blob-shaped segmentations of the anomalies. We experimentally
validated this approach in retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images,
using weak labels of retinal layers. Our method achieved a Dice index of 0.789
in an independent anomaly test set of age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
cases. The resulting segmentations allowed very high accuracy for separating
healthy and diseased cases with late wet AMD, dry geographic atrophy (GA),
diabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal vein occlusion (RVO). Finally, we
qualitatively observed that our approach can also detect other deviations in
normal scans such as cut edge artifacts.

subjective attributes of entities, e.g., whether a movie is ""kid friendly"",
simply estimating precision is complicated by the inherent ambiguity in
measuring subjective phenomena. In this work, we develop a method for
constructing KBs with tunable precision--i.e., KBs that can be made to operate
at a specific false positive rate, despite storing both difficult-to-evaluate
subjective attributes and more traditional factual attributes. The key to our
approach is probabilistically modeling user consensus with respect to each
entity-attribute pair, rather than modeling each pair as either True or False.
Uncertainty in the model is explicitly represented and used to control the KB's
precision. We propose three neural networks for fitting the consensus model and
evaluate each one on data from Google Maps--a large KB of locations and their
subjective and factual attributes. The results demonstrate that our learned
models are well-calibrated and thus can successfully be used to control the
KB's precision. Moreover, when constrained to maintain 95% precision, the best
consensus model matches the F-score of a baseline that models each
entity-attribute pair as a binary variable and does not support tunable
precision. When unconstrained, our model dominates the same baseline by 12%
F-score. Finally, we perform an empirical analysis of attribute-attribute
correlations and show that leveraging them effectively contributes to reduced
uncertainty and better performance in attribute prediction.

This article focuses on this second aspect by analyzing the reliability of two
mathematical models proposed in the literature for the simulation of heat
losses through building walls. The first one, named DuFort-Frankel (DF), is the
classical heat diffusion equation combined with the DuFort-Frankel numerical
scheme. The second is the so-called RC lumped approach, based on a simple
ordinary differential equation to compute the temperature within the wall. The
reliability is evaluated following a two stages method. First, samples of
observations are generated using a pseudo-spectral numerical model for the heat
diffusion equation with known input parameters. The results are then modified
by adding a noise to simulate experimental measurements. Then, for each sample
of observation, the parameter estimation problem is solved using one of the two
mathematical models. The reliability is assessed based on the accuracy of the
approach to recover the unknown parameter. Three case studies are considered
for the estimation of (i) the heat capacity, (ii) the thermal conductivity or
(iii) the heat transfer coefficient at the interface between the wall and the
ambient air. For all cases, the DF mathematical model has a very satisfactory
reliability to estimate the unknown parameters without any bias. However, the
RC model lacks of fidelity and reliability. The error on the estimated
parameter can reach 40% for the heat capacity, 80% for the thermal conductivity
and 450% for the heat transfer coefficient.

produce RM with reversing signs viewed edge-on. Model RM maps are created for a
variety of input parameters using a Faraday screen and are scaled to the same

to find a best fit. Solutions for rotation-only, i.e. relative to a pattern
uniform rotation, did in general, not fit the observations of NGC 4631 well.

best results for the specific region that was modelled in the northern halo are
found with accretion. Since there is abundant evidence for both winds and
accretion in NGC 4631, this modelling technique has the potential to
distinguish between the dominant flows in galaxies.

physical models formulated as a mathematical problem and solved by means of
numerical methods, aiming at evaluating, for instance, the building thermal or
hygrothermal performance by calculating distributions and fluxes of heat and
moisture transfer. Therefore, the choice of the numerical method is crucial
since it is a compromise among (i) the solution accuracy, (ii) the
computational cost to obtain the solution and (iii) the complexity of the
method implementation. An efficient numerical method enables to compute an
accurate solution with a minimum computational run time (CPU). On that account,
this article brings an investigation on the performance of three numerical
methods. The first one is the standard and widely used finite-difference
approach, while the second one is the so-called RC approach, which is a
particular method brought to the building physics area by means of an analogy
of electric circuits. The third numerical method is the spectral one, which has
been recently proposed to solve nonlinear diffusive problems in building
physics. The three methods are evaluated in terms of accuracy on the assessment
of the dependent variable (temperature or vapor pressure) or of density of
fluxes for three different cases: i) heat diffusion through a concrete slab,
ii) moisture diffusion through an aerated concrete slab and iii) heat diffusion
using measured temperatures as boundary conditions. Results highlight the
spectral approach as the most accurate method. The RC based model with a few
number of resistances does not provide accurate results for temperature and
vapor pressure distributions neither to flux densities nor conduction loads.

imprinted on a random set of $47$ image patches followed by an off-line
unsupervised learning algorithm using stochastic gradient descent to optimize
for sparse coding. Our single-layer of sparse coding matched the stride and
patch size of the first convolutional layer of the AlexNet-like deep neural

to a critical value of the trade-off parameter associated with a putative
second order phase transition, an observation supported by a free energy
analysis of D-Wave energy states. When the sparse representations inferred by
the D-Wave $2$X were passed to a linear support vector machine, we obtained a

colors of an image can change all red pixels simultaneously to light red. Such
global uniform changes in images can be less perceptible than perturbing pixels

Observatory, while the polarimetric data were obtained at Pico dos Dias

Fermi/LAT and $R$-band SMARTS light curves. We found a good correlation between
7~mm and $R$-band light curves, with a delay of $170 \pm 30$ days in radio, but
no correlation with the $\gamma$ rays. However, a group of several $\gamma$-ray
flares in April 2011 could be associated with the start of the 7 mm strong
activity observed at the end of 2011.We also detected an increase in $R$-band
polarization degree and rotation of the polarization angle simultaneous with
these flares. Contemporaneous VLBI images at the same radio frequency show two
new strong components close to the core, ejected in directions very different
from that of the jet.The good correlation between radio and $R$-band
variability suggests that their origin is synchrotron radiation. The lack of
correlation with $\gamma$-rays produced by the Inverse Compton process on some
occasions could be due to the lack of low energy photons in the jet direction
or to absorption of the high energy photons by the broad line region clouds.
The variability of the polarization parameters during flares can be easily
explained by the combination of the jet polarization parameters and those of
newly formed jet components.

currents above and below, respectively. The inertial particle velocity is shown
to exponentially decay in time to a velocity that lies close to an average of
seawater and air velocities, weighted by a function of the seawater-to-particle

in the past few years from both industry and academia. In this paper, we
introduce an open-source toolkit, namely LeafNATS, for training and evaluation
of different sequence-to-sequence based models for the NATS task, and for
deploying the pre-trained models to real-world applications. The toolkit is
modularized and extensible in addition to maintaining competitive performance
in the NATS task. A live news blogging system has also been implemented to
demonstrate how these models can aid blog/news editors by providing them
suggestions of headlines and summaries of their articles.

antisymmetric tensor field in the Lorentz breaking framework. The Lorentz
breaking is achieved here by considering a proper subgroup of Lorentz group
together with translation. In this scenario, the gaugeon fields together with
the standard fields of the Abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor theory get mass.
In order to develop the gaugeon formulation for this theory in VSR, we first
introduce a set of dipole vector fields as a quantum gauge freedom to the
action. In order to quantize the dipole vector fields, the VSR-modified
gauge-fixing and corresponding ghost action are constructed as the classical
action is invariant under a VSR-modified gauge transformation. Further, we
present a Type I gaugeon formalism for the Abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor
field theory in VSR. The gauge structures of Fock space constructed with the
help of BRST charges are also discussed.

light in the continuous transverse spatial degrees of freedom of the photons.
This physical phenomenon can be observed in the transverse profile of a
paraxial and quasi-monochromatic beam of light using a spatial light modulator.
The light modulator acts in the laser beam as a weak random potential. Here,
differently from the standard models studied in the literature, our setup
splits the dispersion and potential terms along the beam evolution. By
numerical simulations we confirm the feasibility of our experimental proposal.

vectors. Good embeddings should capture the graph topology, vertex-to-vertex
relationship, and other relevant information about graphs, subgraphs, and
vertices. If these objectives are achieved, they are meaningful,
understandable, and compressed representations of networks. They also provide
more options and tools for data scientists as machine learning on graphs is
still quite limited. Finally, vector operations are simpler and faster than
comparable operations on graphs.
  The main challenge is that one needs to make sure that embeddings well
describe the properties of the graphs. In particular, the decision has to be
made on the embedding dimensionality which highly impacts the quality of an
embedding. As a result, selecting the best embedding is a challenging task and
very often requires domain experts.
  In this paper, we propose a ``divergence score'' that can be assign to
various embeddings to distinguish good ones from bad ones. This general
framework provides a tool for an unsupervised graph embedding comparison. In
order to achieve it, we needed to generalize the well-known Chung-Lu model to
incorporate geometry which is interesting on its own rights. In order to test
our framework, we did a number of experiments with synthetic networks as well
as real-world networks, and various embedding algorithms.

velocities in a dimension instead of the regular velocity update equations as
soon as the so-called potential of the swarm falls below a certain bound in
this dimension, arbitrarily set by the user. In this case, the swarm performs a
forced move. In this paper, we are interested in how, by counting the forced
moves, the swarm can decide for itself to stop its movement because it is
improbable to find better solution candidates as it already has found. We
formally prove that when the swarm is close to a (local) optimum, it behaves
like a blind-searching cloud, and that the frequency of forced moves exceeds a
certain, objective function-independent value. Based on this observation, we
define stopping criteria and evaluate them experimentally showing that good
solution candidates can be found much faster than applying other criteria.

However, in many realistic scenarios label noise is prevalent in the training
images, and overfitting to these noisy labels can significantly harm the
generalization performance of DNNs. We propose a novel technique to identify
data with noisy labels based on the different distributions of the predictive
uncertainties from a DNN over the clean and noisy data. Additionally, the
behavior of the uncertainty over the course of training helps to identify the
network weights which best can be used to relabel the noisy labels. Data with
noisy labels can therefore be cleaned in an iterative process. Our proposed
method can be easily implemented, and shows promising performance on the task
of noisy label detection on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

  Risk",,,,,"cs.SI q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dynamics of protection processes has been a fundamental challenge in
systemic risk analysis. The conceptual principle and methodological techniques
behind the mechanisms involved [in such dynamics] have been harder to grasp
than researchers understood them to be. In this paper, we show how to construct
a large variety of behaviors by applying a simple algorithm to networked
agents, which could, conceivably, offer a straightforward way out of the
complexity. The model starts with the probability that systemic risk spreads.
Even in a very random social structure, the propagation of risk is guaranteed
by an arbitrary network property of a set of elements. Despite intensive
systemic risk, the potential of the absence of failure could also be driven
when there has been a strong investment in protection through a heuristically
evolved protection level. It is very interesting to discover that many
applications are still seeking the mechanisms through which networked
individuals build many of these protection process or mechanisms based on
fitness due to evolutionary drift. Our implementation still needs to be
polished against what happens in the real world, but in general, the approach
could be useful for researchers and those who need to use protection dynamics
to guard against systemic risk under intrinsic randomness in artificial
circumstances.
