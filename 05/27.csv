equations and partial differential equations with hierarchical matrices
($\mathcal{H}$-matrices).
  Experiments show that using an $\mathcal{H}$-matrix LR factorization to solve
a system of linear questions is superior to direct inversion both with respect
to accuracy and efficiency, but so far theoretical estimates quantifying these
advantages were missing.
  Due to a lack of symmetry in $\mathcal{H}$-matrix algorithms, we cannot hope
to prove that the LR factorization takes one third of the operations of the
inversion or the matrix multiplication, as in standard linear algebra. We can,
however, prove that the LR factorization together with two other operations of
similar complexity, i.e., the inversion and multiplication of triangular
matrices, requires not more operations than the matrix multiplication.
  We can complete the estimates by proving an improved upper bound for the
complexity of the matrix multiplication, designed for recently introduced
variants of classical $\mathcal{H}$-matrices.

upper and lower bounds on the optimal (i.e., minimax) regret, and provide
efficient rate-optimal algorithms. Surprisingly, the optimal regret of this

switching budget: when the number of arms is fixed, there are equal-length
phases, where the optimal regret rate remains (almost) the same within each
phase and exhibits abrupt changes between phases; when the number of arms grows
with the time horizon, such abrupt changes become subtler and may disappear,
but a generalized notion of phase transitions involving certain new
measurements still exists. The results enable us to fully characterize the
trade-off between the regret rate and the incurred switching cost in the

Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) using gradient descent (GD) method. Inspired by a
recent line of work, we study the evolutions of network prediction errors
across GD iterations, which can be neatly described in a matrix form. When the
network is sufficiently over-parameterized, these matrices individually
approximate {\em an} integral operator which is determined by the feature
vector distribution $\rho$ only. Consequently, GD method can be viewed as {\em
approximately} applying the powers of this integral operator on the
underlying/target function $f^*$ that generates the responses/labels.
  We show that if $f^*$ admits a low-rank approximation with respect to the
eigenspaces of this integral operator, then the empirical risk decreases to
this low-rank approximation error at a linear rate which is determined by $f^*$
and $\rho$ only, i.e., the rate is independent of the sample size $n$.
Furthermore, if $f^*$ has zero low-rank approximation error, then, as long as
the width of the neural network is $\Omega(n\log n)$, the empirical risk
decreases to $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first result showing the sufficiency of nearly-linear network
over-parameterization. We provide an application of our general results to the
setting where $\rho$ is the uniform distribution on the spheres and $f^*$ is a
polynomial. Throughout this paper, we consider the scenario where the input
dimension $d$ is fixed.

multi-rigid body systems that calculates (predicts) constraint forces for
typical bilateral and unilateral constraints, contact constraints with

numerical problems or require regularization. Coulomb friction for contact is
modeled using a true friction cone, rather than a linearized approximation. The
computational expense of the solver is dependent upon the types of constraints
present in the input. The hardest (in a computational complexity sense) inputs
are reducible to solving convex optimization problems, i.e., polynomial time
solvable. The simplest inputs require only solving a linear system. The solver
is L-stable, which will imply that the forces due to constraints induce no
computational stiffness into the multi-body dynamics differential equations.
This approach is targeted to multibodies simulated with coarse accuracy,
subject to computational stiffness arising from constraints, and where the
number of constraint equations is not large compared to the number of multibody
position and velocity state variables. For such applications, the approach
should prove far faster than using other implicit integration approaches. I
assess the approach on some fundamental multibody dynamics problems.

  Two-Edge-Connected Spanning Subgraph",,,,,"cs.DS cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The minimum-weight $2$-edge-connected spanning subgraph (2-ECSS) problem is a
natural generalization of the well-studied minimum-weight spanning tree (MST)
problem, and it has received considerable attention in the area of network
design. The latter problem asks for a minimum-weight subgraph with an edge
connectivity of $1$ between each pair of vertices while the former strengthens
this edge-connectivity requirement to $2$. Despite this resemblance, the 2-ECSS
problem is considerably more complex than MST. While MST admits a linear-time
centralized exact algorithm, 2-ECSS is NP-hard and the best known centralized
approximation algorithm for it (that runs in polynomial time) gives a
$2$-approximation.
  In this paper, we give a deterministic distributed algorithm with round
complexity of $\widetilde{O}(D+\sqrt{n})$ that computes a
$(5+\epsilon)$-approximation of 2-ECSS, for any constant $\epsilon>0$. Up to
logarithmic factors, this complexity matches the
$\widetilde{\Omega}(D+\sqrt{n})$ lower bound that can be derived from Das Sarma
et al. [STOC'11], as shown by Censor-Hillel and Dory [OPODIS'17]. Our result is
the first distributed constant approximation for 2-ECSS in the nearly optimal
time and it improves on a recent randomized algorithm of Dory [PODC'18], which
achieved an $O(\log n)$-approximation in $\widetilde{O}(D+\sqrt{n})$ rounds.
  We also present an alternative algorithm for $O(\log n)$-approximation, whose
round complexity is linear in the low-congestion shortcut parameter of the
network, following a framework introduced by Ghaffari and Haeupler [SODA'16].
This algorithm has round complexity $\widetilde{O}(D+\sqrt{n})$ in worst-case
networks but it provably runs much faster in many well-behaved graph families
of interest. For instance, it runs in $\widetilde{O}(D)$ time in planar
networks and those with bounded genus, bounded path-width or bounded
tree-width.

better than the next best previous model, UNet, at 0.47. Reversing the train

observed that the generalization error decreases as $n^{-\beta}$ where $n$ is

methods to real datasets. For MNIST we find $\beta\approx 0.4$ and for CIFAR10
$\beta\approx 0.1$, for both regression and classification tasks, and for
Gaussian or Laplace kernels. To rationalize the existence of non-trivial
exponents that can be independent of the specific kernel used, we study the
Teacher-Student framework for kernels. In this scheme, a Teacher generates data
according to a Gaussian random field, and a Student learns them via kernel
regression. With a simplifying assumption -- namely that the data are sampled
from a regular lattice -- we derive analytically $\beta$ for translation
invariant kernels, using previous results from the kriging literature. Provided
that the Student is not too sensitive to high frequencies, $\beta$ depends only
on the smoothness and dimension of the training data. We confirm numerically
that these predictions hold when the training points are sampled at random on a
hypersphere. Overall, the test error is found to be controlled by the magnitude
of the projection of the true function on the kernel eigenvectors whose rank is
larger than $n$. Using this idea we predict relate the exponent $\beta$ to an
exponent $a$ describing how the coefficients of the true function in the
eigenbasis of the kernel decay with rank. We extract $a$ from real data by
performing kernel PCA, leading to $\beta\approx0.36$ for MNIST and
$\beta\approx0.07$ for CIFAR10, in good agreement with observations. We argue
that these rather large exponents are possible due to the small effective
dimension of the data.

work. These are integro-differential equations arising as models of propagation
phenomena in continuum media with nonlocal interactions including neural
tissue, porous media flow, peridynamics, models with fractional diffusion, as
well as continuum limits of interacting dynamical systems. The principal
challenge of numerical integration of nonlocal systems stems from the lack of
spatial regularity of the data and solutions intrinsic to nonlocal models. To
overcome this problem we propose a semidiscrete numerical scheme based on the
combination of sparse Monte Carlo and discontinuous Galerkin methods. An
important feature of our method is sparsity. Sparse sampling of points in the
Monte Carlo approximation of the nonlocal term allows to use fewer
discretization points without compromising the accuracy.
  We prove convergence of the numerical method and estimate the rate of
convergence. There are two principal ingredients in the error of the numerical
method related to the use of Monte Calro and Galerkin approximations
respectively. We analyze both errors. Two representative examples of
discontinuous kernels are presented. The first example features a kernel with a
singularity, while the kernel in the second example experiences jump
discontinuity. We show how the information about the singularity in the former
case and the geometry of the discontinuity set in the latter translate into the
rate of convergence of the numerical procedure. In addition, we illustrate the
rate of convergence estimate with a numerical example of an initial value
problem, for which an explicit analytic solution is available. Numerical
results are consistent with analytical estimates.

contrast this upper bound with two lower bounds. The first lower bound shows
that our analysis of uniform sampling is tight; that is, a smaller uniform
sample will likely not be a core set. The second lower bound shows that in some
sense uniform sampling is close to optimal, as significantly smaller core sets

scale of the moir\'e period are dominated by phason modes, i.e., acoustic
branches of the incommensurate lattice resulting from coherent superpositions
of optical phonons. In the limit of small twist angles, these modes describe
the sliding motion of stacking domain walls separating regions of partial
commensuration. The resulting soliton network is a soft elastic manifold, whose
reduced rigidity arises from the competition between intralayer (elastic) and
interlayer (adhesion) forces governing lattice relaxation. Shear deformations
of the beating pattern dominate the electron-phason coupling to the leading
order in $t_{\perp}/t$, the ratio between interlayer and intralayer hopping
parameters. This coupling lifts the layer degeneracy of the Dirac cones at the
corners of the Moir\'e Brillouin zone, which could explain the observed 4-fold
(instead of 8-fold) Landau level degeneracy. Electron-phason scattering gives
rise to a linear-in-temperature contribution to the resistivity that increases
with decreasing twist angle due to the reduction of the stiffness of the
soliton network. This contribution alone, however, seems to be insufficient to
explain the huge enhancement of the resistivity of the normal state close to

(MCMC) for Bayesian posterior inference. Though popular, VB comes with few
theoretical guarantees, most of which focus on well-specified models. However,
models are rarely well-specified in practice. In this work, we study VB under
model misspecification. We prove the VB posterior is asymptotically normal and
centers at the value that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the
true data-generating distribution. Moreover, the VB posterior mean centers at
the same value and is also asymptotically normal. These results generalize the
variational Bernstein--von Mises theorem [29] to misspecified models. As a
consequence of these results, we find that the model misspecification error
dominates the variational approximation error in VB posterior predictive
distributions. It explains the widely observed phenomenon that VB achieves
comparable predictive accuracy with MCMC even though VB uses an approximating
family. As illustrations, we study VB under three forms of model
misspecification, ranging from model over-/under-dispersion to latent
dimensionality misspecification. We conduct two simulation studies that
demonstrate the theoretical results.

depend sensitively on the interlayer coupling, which is intimately connected to
the stacking arrangement and the interlayer spacing. For example, simply
changing the twist angle between graphene layers can induce a variety of
correlated electronic phases, which can be controlled further in a continuous
manner by applying hydrostatic pressure to decrease the interlayer spacing. In
the recently discovered 2D magnets, theory suggests that the interlayer
exchange coupling strongly depends on layer separation, while the stacking
arrangement can even change the sign of the magnetic exchange, thus drastically
modifying the ground state. Here, we demonstrate pressure tuning of magnetic
order in the 2D magnet CrI3. We probe the magnetic states using tunneling and
scanning magnetic circular dichroism microscopy measurements. We find that the
interlayer magnetic coupling can be more than doubled by hydrostatic pressure.
In bilayer CrI3, pressure induces a transition from layered antiferromagnetic
to ferromagnetic phases. In trilayer CrI3, pressure can create coexisting
domains of three phases, one ferromagnetic and two distinct antiferromagnetic.
The observed changes in magnetic order can be explained by changes in the
stacking arrangement. Such coupling between stacking order and magnetism
provides ample opportunities for designer magnetic phases and functionalities.

""If $P$ is a ring-theoretic property, how does one define the graded version
$P_{\operatorname{gr}}$ of the property $P$ in a meaningful way?"". Some
properties of rings have straightforward and unambiguous generalizations to
their graded versions and these generalizations satisfy all the matching
properties of the nongraded case. If $P$ is either being unit-regular, having
stable range 1 or being directly finite, that is not the case. The first part
of the paper addresses this issue. Searching for appropriate generalizations,
we consider graded versions of cancellation, internal cancellation,
substitution, and module-theoretic direct finiteness.
  In the second part of the paper, we turn to Leavitt path algebras. If $K$ is
a trivially graded field and $E$ is an oriented graph, the Leavitt path algebra
$L_K(E)$ is naturally graded by the ring of integers. If $E$ is a finite graph,
we present a property of $E$ which is equivalent with $L_K(E)$ being graded
unit-regular. This property critically depends on the lengths of paths to
cycles making it stand out from other known graph conditions which characterize
algebraic properties of $L_K(E).$ It also further illustrates that graded
unit-regularity is quite restrictive in comparison to the alternative
generalization of unit-regularity which we consider in the first part of the
paper.

from classical simulations of parameterized quantum circuits. We compute these
descriptors for different circuit structures, varying the qubit connectivity

information regarding graph topology. Generalized PageRanks (GPR), which
represent weighted sums of LPs of RWs, utilize the discriminative power of LP
features to enable many graph-based learning studies. Previous work in the area
has mostly focused on evaluating suitable weights for GPRs, and only a few
studies so far have attempted to derive the optimal weights of GRPs for a given
application. We take a fundamental step forward in this direction by using
random graph models to better our understanding of the behavior of GPRs. In
this context, we provide a rigorous non-asymptotic analysis for the convergence
of LPs and GPRs to their mean-field values on edge-independent random graphs.
Although our theoretical results apply to many problem settings, we focus on
the task of seed-expansion community detection over stochastic block models.
There, we find that the predictive power of LPs decreases significantly slower
than previously reported based on asymptotic findings. Given this result, we
propose a new GPR, termed Inverse PR (IPR), with LP weights that increase for
the initial few steps of the walks. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real, large-scale networks illustrate the superiority of IPR compared to other
GPRs for seeded community detection.

significant attention due to their attractive inference properties. While
parameter learning in SPNs is well developed, structure learning leaves
something to be desired: Even though there is a plethora of SPN structure
learners, most of them are somewhat ad-hoc and based on intuition rather than a
clear learning principle. In this paper, we introduce a well-principled
Bayesian framework for SPN structure learning. First, we decompose the problem
into i) laying out a computational graph, and ii) learning the so-called scope
function over the graph. The first is rather unproblematic and akin to neural
network architecture validation. The second represents the effective structure
of the SPN and needs to respect the usual structural constraints in SPN, i.e.
completeness and decomposability. While representing and learning the scope
function is somewhat involved in general, in this paper, we propose a natural
parametrisation for an important and widely used special case of SPNs. These
structural parameters are incorporated into a Bayesian model, such that
simultaneous structure and parameter learning is cast into monolithic Bayesian
posterior inference. In various experiments, our Bayesian SPNs often improve
test likelihoods over greedy SPN learners. Further, since the Bayesian
framework protects against overfitting, we can evaluate hyper-parameters
directly on the Bayesian model score, waiving the need for a separate
validation set, which is especially beneficial in low data regimes. Bayesian
SPNs can be applied to heterogeneous domains and can easily be extended to
nonparametric formulations. Moreover, our Bayesian approach is the first, which
consistently and robustly learns SPN structures under missing data.

produce nearly photorealistic samples and obtain scores similar to the data
distribution on heuristics such as Frechet Inception Distance (FID). These
results, especially on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, suggest that DGMs
are learning the data distribution in a perceptually meaningful space and can
be used in downstream tasks. To test this latter hypothesis, we use
class-conditional generative models from a number of model
classes---variational autoencoders, autoregressive models, and generative
adversarial networks (GANs)---to infer the class labels of real data. We
perform this inference by training an image classifier using only synthetic
data and using the classifier to predict labels on real data. The performance
on this task, which we call Classification Accuracy Score (CAS), reveals some
surprising results not identified by traditional metrics and constitute our
contributions. First, when using a state-of-the-art GAN (BigGAN-deep), Top-1

original data; and conditional generative models from other model classes, such
as Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder-2 (VQ-VAE-2) and Hierarchical
Autoregressive Models (HAMs), substantially outperform GANs on this benchmark.
Second, CAS automatically surfaces particular classes for which generative
models failed to capture the data distribution, and were previously unknown in
the literature. Third, we find traditional GAN metrics such as Inception Score
(IS) and FID neither predictive of CAS nor useful when evaluating non-GAN
models. Furthermore, in order to facilitate better diagnoses of generative
models, we open-source the proposed metric.

high-dimensional parameter $\theta$ in an individualized linear threshold
$\theta^T Z$ for a continuous variable $X$, which minimizes the disagreement
between $\text{sign}(X-\theta^TZ)$ and a binary response $Y$. While the problem
can be formulated into the M-estimation framework, minimizing the corresponding
empirical risk function is computationally intractable due to discontinuity of
the sign function. Moreover, estimating $\theta$ even in the fixed-dimensional
setting is known as a nonregular problem leading to nonstandard asymptotic
theory. To tackle the computational and theoretical challenges in the
estimation of the high-dimensional parameter $\theta$, we propose an empirical
risk minimization approach based on a regularized smoothed loss function. The
statistical and computational trade-off of the algorithm is investigated.
Statistically, we show that the finite sample error bound for estimating
$\theta$ in $\ell_2$ norm is $(s\log d/n)^{\beta/(2\beta+1)}$, where $d$ is the
dimension of $\theta$, $s$ is the sparsity level, $n$ is the sample size and
$\beta$ is the smoothness of the conditional density of $X$ given the response
$Y$ and the covariates $Z$. The convergence rate is nonstandard and slower than
that in the classical Lasso problems. Furthermore, we prove that the resulting
estimator is minimax rate optimal up to a logarithmic factor. The Lepski's
method is developed to achieve the adaption to the unknown sparsity $s$ and
smoothness $\beta$. Computationally, an efficient path-following algorithm is
proposed to compute the solution path. We show that this algorithm achieves
geometric rate of convergence for computing the whole path. Finally, we
evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed estimator in simulation

smell-related information can be effectively exploited to improve the
performance of change prediction models, ie models having as goal that of
indicating to developers which classes are more likely to change in the future,
so that they may apply preventive maintenance actions. Specifically, we exploit
the so-called intensity index - a previously defined metric that captures the
severity of a code smell - and evaluate its contribution when added as
additional feature in the context of three state of the art change prediction
models based on product, process, and developer-based features. We also compare
the performance achieved by the proposed model with the one of an alternative
technique that considers the previously defined antipattern metrics, namely a
set of indicators computed considering the history of code smells in files. Our
results report that (i) the prediction performance of the intensity-including

detection, SLIC can run with a wrong MF and render limited gains. Therefore,
designing a fall-back mechanism is of interest that only activates SLIC when
the detected MF is reliable. Otherwise, a fall-back happens and the receiver
turns to eIRC. Finding a closed-form expression of an optimal fall-back

  Theory: An Abstract Algebraic Interpretation of Convolutional Neural Networks","9 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Researchers are actively trying to gain better insights into the
representational properties of convolutional neural networks for guiding better
network designs and for interpreting a network's computational nature. Gaining
such insights can be an arduous task due to the number of parameters in a
network and the complexity of a network's architecture. Current approaches of
neural network interpretation include Bayesian probabilistic interpretations
and information theoretic interpretations. In this study, we take a different
approach to studying convolutional neural networks by proposing an abstract
algebraic interpretation using finite transformation semigroup theory.
Specifically, convolutional layers are broken up and mapped to a finite space.
The state space of the proposed finite transformation semigroup is then defined
as a single element within the convolutional layer, with the acting elements
defined by surrounding state elements combined with convolution kernel
elements. Generators of the finite transformation semigroup are defined to
complete the interpretation. We leverage this approach to analyze the basic
properties of the resulting finite transformation semigroup to gain insights on
the representational properties of convolutional neural networks, including
insights into quantized network representation. Such a finite transformation
semigroup interpretation can also enable better understanding outside of the
confines of fixed lattice data structures, thus useful for handling data that
lie on irregular lattices. Furthermore, the proposed abstract algebraic
interpretation is shown to be viable for interpreting convolutional operations
within a variety of convolutional neural network architectures.

abstractions. In trick-taking card games like Bridge or Skat, large information

especially difficult to construct because the precise holdings of each player

particularly interesting models, as they are among the only four cases which
have algebraic generating functions.
  Here we investigate how the properties of the Kreweras and reverse Kreweras

three real-valued weights $a,b,c$ with visits by the walks to the $x$-axis, the
$y$-axis and the origin $(0,0)$ respectively. These models were partially
solved in a recent paper by Beaton, Owczarek and Rechnitzer (2019). We apply
the algebraic kernel method to completely solve these two models. We find that
reverse Kreweras walks have an algebraic generating function for all $a,b,c$,
regardless of whether the walks are restricted to end at the origin or on one
of the axes, or may end anywhere at all. For Kreweras walks, the generating
function for walks returning to the origin is algebraic, but the other cases
are only D-finite. To our knowledge this is the first example of a
quarter-plane model with this property.

They can be used for exchanging secret-keys as well as realizing other
cryptographic primitives such as commitment and oblivious transfer. To be
really useful, noisy channels have to be consider in the scenario where a
cheating party has some degree of control over the channel characteristics.
Damg\r{a}rd et al. (EUROCRYPT 1999) proposed a more realistic model where such
level of control is permitted to an adversary, the so called unfair noisy
channels, and proved that they can be used to obtain commitment and oblivious
transfer protocols. Given that noisy channels are a precious resource for
cryptographic purposes, one important question is determining the optimal rate
in which they can be used. The commitment capacity has already been determined
for the cases of discrete memoryless channels and Gaussian channels. In this
work we address the problem of determining the commitment capacity of unfair
noisy channels. We compute a single-letter characterization of the commitment
capacity of unfair noisy channels. In the case where an adversary has no
control over the channel (the fair case) our capacity reduces to the well-known
capacity of a discrete memoryless binary symmetric channel.

most typical DAG consensuses, Tangle, we investigate the impact of network load
on the performance and security of the DAG-based ledger. Considering unsteady
network load, we first propose a Markov chain model to capture the behavior of
DAG consensus process under dynamic load conditions. The key performance
metrics, i.e., cumulative weight and confirmation delay are analysed based on
the proposed model. Then, we leverage a stochastic model to analyse the
probability of a successful double-spending attack in different network load
regimes. The results can provide an insightful understanding of DAG consensus
process, e.g., how the network load affects the confirmation delay and the
probability of a successful attack. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate the
trade-off between security level and confirmation delay, which can act as a
guidance for practical deployment of DAG-based ledgers.

monitoring the environment, to know the stochastically evolving pure state of
the system without altering the master equation. In general, even for a system
with a finite Hilbert space dimension $D$, the pure state trajectory will
explore an infinite number of points in Hilbert space, meaning that the
dimension $K$ of the classical memory required for the tracking is infinite.
However, Karasik and Wiseman [Phys. Rev. Lett., 106(2):020406, 2011] showed
that tracking of a qubit ($D=2$) is always possible with a bit ($K=2$), and
gave a heuristic argument implying that a finite $K$ should be sufficient for
any $D$, although beyond $D=2$ it would be necessary to have $K>D$. Our paper
is concerned with rigorously investigating the relationship between $D$ and
$K_{\rm min}$, the smallest feasible $K$. We confirm the long-standing
conjecture of Karasik and Wiseman that, for generic systems with $D>2$, $K_{\rm
min}>D$, by a computational proof (via Hilbert Nullstellensatz certificates of
infeasibility). That is, beyond $D=2$, $D$-dimensional open quantum systems are
provably harder to track than $D$-dimensional open classical systems. Moreover,
we develop, and better justify, a new heuristic to guide our expectation of
$K_{\rm min}$ as a function of $D$, taking into account the number $L$ of
Lindblad operators as well as symmetries in the problem. The use of invariant
subspace and Wigner symmetries makes it tractable to conduct a numerical
search, using the method of polynomial homotopy continuation, to find finite
physically realizable ensembles (as they are known) in $D=3$. The results of
this search support our heuristic. We thus have confidence in the most
interesting feature of our heuristic: in the absence of symmetries, $K_{\rm
min} \sim D^2$, implying a quadratic gap between the classical and quantum
tracking problems.

gradient compressors is provided. By partitioning the gradient into blocks, a
blockwise compressor is introduced such that each gradient block is compressed

reduction on communication. Experimental results show that the proposed method
converges as fast as full-precision distributed momentum SGD and achieves the

develop a novel protocol for realizing a two-atom blockade-error-free quantum

adiabatic condition is preserved. We adopt an optimized super-Gaussian optical
pulse with $k\pi$ ($k\gg 1$) area accompanied by a smooth tuning for the DDI,
composing a circular stimulated Raman adiabatic passage, which can robustly
ensure a faster operation time $\sim 80ns$ as well as a highly-efficient gate
fidelity $\sim0.9996$. This theoretical protocol offers a flexible treatment
for hybrid interactions in complex Rydberg systems, enabling on-demand design

and add non-lineality. To tackle this problem, we investigate the expressive
power of graph NNs via their asymptotic behaviors as the layer size tends to
infinity. Our strategy is to generalize the forward propagation of a Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN), which is a popular graph NN variant, as a specific
dynamical system. In the case of a GCN, we show that when its weights satisfy
the conditions determined by the spectra of the (augmented) normalized
Laplacian, its output exponentially approaches the set of signals that carry
information of the connected components and node degrees only for
distinguishing nodes. Our theory enables us to relate the expressive power of
GCNs with the topological information of the underlying graphs inherent in the
graph spectra. To demonstrate this, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of
GCNs on the Erd\H{o}s -- R\'{e}nyi graph. We show that when the Erd\H{o}s --
R\'{e}nyi graph is sufficiently dense and large, a broad range of GCNs on it
suffers from the ""information loss"" in the limit of infinite layers with high
probability. Based on the theory, we provide a principled guideline for weight
normalization of graph NNs. We experimentally confirm that the proposed weight
scaling enhances the predictive performance of GCNs in real data. Code is

online learning systems, which can promote many applications in education
domain. Unfortunately, many supervised approaches suffer from the problem of
scarce human labeled data, whereas abundant unlabeled resources are highly
underutilized. To alleviate this problem, an effective solution is to use
pre-trained representations for question understanding. However, existing
pre-training methods in NLP area are infeasible to learn test question
representations due to several domain-specific characteristics in education.
First, questions usually comprise of heterogeneous data including content text,
images and side information. Second, there exists both basic linguistic
information as well as domain logic and knowledge. To this end, in this paper,
we propose a novel pre-training method, namely QuesNet, for comprehensively
learning question representations. Specifically, we first design a unified
framework to aggregate question information with its heterogeneous inputs into
a comprehensive vector. Then we propose a two-level hierarchical pre-training
algorithm to learn better understanding of test questions in an unsupervised
way. Here, a novel holed language model objective is developed to extract
low-level linguistic features, and a domain-oriented objective is proposed to
learn high-level logic and knowledge. Moreover, we show that QuesNet has good
capability of being fine-tuned in many question-based tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments on large-scale real-world question data, where the
experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of QuesNet for
question understanding as well as its superior applicability.

shown that in the limit, all quantities appearing in the swampland conjecture
remain well-defined within the single-field DBI model. Based on a consistency
argument, we then speculate that the condition derived in this way can be
considered as the de Sitter swampland conjecture for a DBI scalar field by its
own. The condition differs from those proposed in the literature and only the
one in the present paper passes the consistency argument. As a byproduct, we
also point out that one of the inequalities in the swampland conjecture for a

used for large-scale approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. Bucket search,
also called hash lookup, can achieve fast query speed with a sub-linear time
cost based on the inverted index table constructed from hash codes. Many
metrics have been adopted to evaluate hashing algorithms. However, all existing
metrics are improper to evaluate the hash codes for bucket search. On one hand,
all existing metrics ignore the retrieval time cost which is an important
factor reflecting the performance of search. On the other hand, some of them,
such as mean average precision (MAP), suffer from the uncertainty problem as
the ranked list is based on integer-valued Hamming distance, and are
insensitive to Hamming radius as these metrics only depend on relative Hamming
distance. Other metrics, such as precision at Hamming radius R, fail to
evaluate global performance as these metrics only depend on one specific
Hamming radius. In this paper, we first point out the problems of existing
metrics which have been ignored by the hashing community, and then propose a
novel evaluation metric called radius aware mean average precision (RAMAP) to
evaluate hash codes for bucket search. Furthermore, two coding strategies are
also proposed to qualitatively show the problems of existing metrics.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed RAMAP can provide more proper

neural network first grows new connections based on the gradients to increase
the network capacity to accommodate new data. Then, the framework iteratively
prunes away connections based on the magnitude of weights to enhance network

lightweight DNN that is both ready for inference and suitable for future

Specifically, we first decide ""where-to-look"" through a novel spotlight

state, where the spin excitations are fractionalized into itinerant and
localized Majorana fermions; the former spectrum has a broad continuum ranging
up to a high energy, while the latter has a sharp peak at a low energy. Despite
tremendous efforts, it remains elusive to clearly identify these distinct
Majorana excitations in experiments. Here we show their manifestation in the
time evolution after quenching the magnetic field, by using the time-dependent
Majorana mean-field theory for both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
Kitaev models. We find that the transient spin dynamics from the quantum spin
liquid states is qualitatively different from the conventional spin precessions
by the quench from the high-field forced-ferromagnetic state. We obtain
peculiar time evolutions with distinct time scales, i.e., short-time decay of
high-energy components associated with the itinerant Majorana excitations, and
long-lived excitations at a low energy by the localized ones. These peculiar
behaviors are caused by the energy transfer between the two Majorana
quasiparticles after the field quench. Moreover, we find that the Majorana
semimetal with the point nodes in equilibrium turns into a Majorana metal with
the transient ""Fermi surfaces"" by the energy transfer. In particular, for the
quench from the intermediate-field quantum spin liquid in the antiferromagnetic
Kitaev model, the Fermi surfaces change their topology in the time evolution,
which is regarded as a dynamical version of the Majorana ""Lifshitz transition"".
Our results unveil that the real-time dynamics provides another route to not

materials of Kitaev magnets but also unprecedented quantum phases that cannot

meta-learning architectures, (2) meta-learning the learning algorithms
themselves, and (3) generating effective learning environments. I argue that
either approach could produce general AI first, and both are scientifically
worthwhile irrespective of which is the fastest path. Because both are
promising, yet the ML community is currently committed to the manual approach,
I argue that our community should increase its research investment in the AI-GA
approach. To encourage such research, I describe promising work in each of the
Three Pillars. I also discuss AI-GA-specific safety and ethical considerations.
Because it it may be the fastest path to general AI and because it is
inherently scientifically interesting to understand the conditions in which a
simple algorithm can produce general AI (as happened on Earth where Darwinian
evolution produced human intelligence), I argue that the pursuit of AI-GAs
should be considered a new grand challenge of computer science research.

neighbor search, outperforming traditional tree-based and LSH-based methods.
Similarity graphs perform the search via greedy routing: a query traverses the
graph and in each vertex moves to the adjacent vertex that is the closest to
this query. In practice, similarity graphs are often susceptible to local
minima, when queries do not reach its nearest neighbors, getting stuck in
suboptimal vertices. In this paper we propose to learn the routing function
that overcomes local minima via incorporating information about the graph
global structure. In particular, we augment the vertices of a given graph with
additional representations that are learned to provide the optimal routing from
the start vertex to the query nearest neighbor. By thorough experiments, we
demonstrate that the proposed learnable routing successfully diminishes the
local minima problem and significantly improves the overall search performance.

communication of model updates among machines becomes a significant performance
bottleneck and various lossy update compression techniques have been proposed
to alleviate this problem. In this work, we introduce a new, simple yet
theoretically and practically effective compression technique: natural
compression (NC). Our technique is applied individually to all entries of the
to-be-compressed update vector and works by randomized rounding to the nearest
(negative or positive) power of two, which can be computed in a ""natural"" way
by ignoring the mantissa. We show that compared to no compression, NC increases
the second moment of the compressed vector by not more than the tiny factor
$\frac{9}{8}$, which means that the effect of NC on the convergence speed of
popular training algorithms, such as distributed SGD, is negligible. However,
the communications savings enabled by NC are substantial, leading to
$3$-$4\times$ improvement in overall theoretical running time. For applications
requiring more aggressive compression, we generalize NC to natural dithering,
which we prove is exponentially better than the common random dithering
technique. Our compression operators can be used on their own or in combination
with existing operators for a more aggressive combined effect and offer new
state-of-the-art both in theory and practice.

coco-fatty-acid-monoethanolamide (CMEA) suppresses the drop deposition; no drop
adhesion is observed in the absence of polymer. The drop-to-substrate adhesion
is interpreted in terms of the acting surface forces: polymer bridging

role in arriving at such design decisions. However, the stakeholders may act in
a biased manner in order to ensure that their requirements and concerns are
addressed in a specific way in the software. Most of the existing methods of
architectural decision-making do not adequately account for such biased
behaviour of stakeholders. We view the software architecture design as a
collective decision making (CDM) problem in social choice theory, and introduce
the central ideas of mechanism design to our field. Our contributions are
twofold: i) Using the impossibility results from social choice theory, we show
that a rational stakeholder can game, to her advantage, almost every known
method of software architecture decision making. ii) We also show that if the
architect is willing to bear the extra cost of giving suitable incentives to
stakeholders, then architectural decision making can be protected from
strategic (biased) manipulations. For achieving this objective, we introduce
the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism from social choice theory to the

and the fluid behavior. In simulations, there often is a need to vary these

different solids and different fluids. For instance, a shipping company wants
to know how the material, a ship's hull is made of, interacts with fluids at
different Reynolds and Strouhal numbers before the building process takes
place. Also, the behavior of such models for solids with different properties
is considered before the prototype phase. A parameter-dependent linear
fluid-structure interaction discretization provides approximations for a bundle
of different parameters at one step. Such a discretization with respect to
different material parameters leads to a big block-diagonal system matrix that
is equivalent to a matrix equation as discussed in [KressnerTobler 2011]. The
unknown is then a matrix which can be approximated using a low-rank approach
that represents the iterate by a tensor. This paper discusses a low-rank GMRES

simple to implement, it has been shown to be a surprisingly effective method of
data augmentation for image classification: DNNs trained with mixup show
noticeable gains in classification performance on a number of image
classification benchmarks. In this work, we discuss a hitherto untouched aspect
of mixup training -- the calibration and predictive uncertainty of models
trained with mixup. We find that DNNs trained with mixup are significantly
better calibrated -- i.e., the predicted softmax scores are much better
indicators of the actual likelihood of a correct prediction -- than DNNs
trained in the regular fashion. We conduct experiments on a number of image
classification architectures and datasets -- including large-scale datasets
like ImageNet -- and find this to be the case. Additionally, we find that
merely mixing features does not result in the same calibration benefit and that
the label smoothing in mixup training plays a significant role in improving
calibration. Finally, we also observe that mixup-trained DNNs are less prone to
over-confident predictions on out-of-distribution and random-noise data. We
conclude that the typical overconfidence seen in neural networks, even on
in-distribution data is likely a consequence of training with hard labels,
suggesting that mixup be employed for classification tasks where predictive

spectral entropy is a widely adopted measure. However, such a metric is
invariant under any permutation of the estimations of the powers of individual
frequency components on a predefined grid. This erases the order structure
inherent in the spectrum which is also an important aspect of irregularity of
the signal. To disentangle the order structure and extract meaningful
information from raw digital signal, novel analysis method is necessary.
Approach: A novel method to depict the order structure by simply ranking power
estimations on frequency grid of a evenly spaced signal is proposed. Two
descriptors mapping real- and vector-valued power spectrum estimation of a
signal into scalar value are defined in a heuristic manner. By definition, the
proposed descriptor is capable of distinguishing signals with identical
spectrum entropies. Main Results: The proposed descriptor showed its potential
in diverse problems. Significant (p<0.001) differences were observed from brain
signals and surface electromyography of different pathological/physiological
states. Drastic change accompanied by the alteration of the underlying process
of signals enables it as candidate feature for seizure detection and endpoint
detection in speech signal. Significance: This letter explores the previously
ignored order structure in the spectrum of physiological signal. We take one
step forward along this direction by proposing two computationally efficient
descriptors with guaranteed information gain. As far as the authors are
concerned, this is the first work revealing the effectiveness of the order
structure in the spectrum in physiological signal processing.

facial features provide useful information. However, estimating age from face
images becomes challenging when people are distant from the camera or occluded.
A person's gait is a unique biometric feature that can be perceived efficiently
even at a distance. Thus, gait can be used to predict age when face images are
not available. However, existing gait-based classification or regression
methods ignore the ordinal relationship of different ages, which is an
important clue for age estimation. This paper proposes an ordinal distribution
regression with a global and local convolutional neural network for gait-based
age estimation. Specifically, we decompose gait-based age regression into a
series of binary classifications to incorporate the ordinal age information.
Then, an ordinal distribution loss is proposed to consider the inner
relationships among these classifications by penalizing the distribution
discrepancy between the estimated value and the ground truth. In addition, our
neural network comprises a global and three local sub-networks, and thus, is
capable of learning the global structure and local details from the head, body,

mass diagram ($\lg SFR - \lg M_*$). We therefore classify them into four types:
the star-forming early types (sEs), the quenched early types (qEs), the
star-forming late types (sLs) and the quenched late types (qLs). We checked
many parameters on various environmental scales for their potential effects on
the quenching rates of late types and early types, as well as the early type
fractions among star-forming galaxies and those among quenched galaxies. These
parameters include: the stellar mass $M_*$, and the halo mass $M_{halo}$; the
small-scale environmental parameters, such as the halo centric radius
$R_p/r_{180}$ and the third nearest neighbor distances ($d_{3nn}$); the
large-scale environmental parameters, specifically whether they are located in

transformation is mainly regulated by the stellar mass. Quenching is mainly
driven by the stellar mass for more massive galaxies and by the halo mass for

halo quenching effect in early type galaxies, which might be attributed to
their lacking of cold gas or earlier accretion into the massive host halos.

thermal transport at various length scales in many materials. In this method,
two local thermostats at different temperatures are used to generate a
nonequilibrium steady state with a constant heat flux. Conventionally, the
thermal conductivity of a finite system is calculated as the ratio between the
heat flux and the temperature gradient extracted from the linear part of the
temperature profile away from the local thermostats. Here we show that, with a
proper choice of the thermostat, the nonlinear part of the temperature profile
should actually not be excluded in thermal transport calculations. We compare
NEMD results against those from the atomistic Green's function method in the
ballistic regime, and those from the homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular
dynamics method in the ballistic-to-diffusive regime. These comparisons suggest
that in all the transport regimes, one should directly calculate the thermal
conductance from the temperature difference between the heat source and sink
and, if needed, convert it to the thermal conductivity by multiplying it with
the system length. Furthermore, we find that the Langevin thermostat
outperforms the Nos\'{e}-Hoover (chain) thermostat in NEMD simulations because
of its stochastic and local nature. We show that this is particularly important
for studying asymmetric carbon-based nanostructures, for which the

semilinear wave equations with the same kind of nonlinearities. Our approach
follows the one for the respective classical wave equation by Zhou Yi. In
particular, an explicit integral representation formula for a solution of the
corresponding linear scale-invariant wave equation, which is derived by using
Yagdjian's integral transform approach, is employed in the blow-up argument.
While in the case of the single equation we may use a comparison argument, for
the weakly coupled system an iteration argument is applied.

perception in autonomous driving and studied Adversarial Examples (AEs) for
object detection models. However, in such visual perception pipeline the
detected objects must also be tracked, in a process called Multiple Object
Tracking (MOT), to build the moving trajectories of surrounding obstacles.
Since MOT is designed to be robust against errors in object detection, it poses
a general challenge to existing attack techniques that blindly target objection
detection: we find that a success rate of over 98% is needed for them to
actually affect the tracking results, a requirement that no existing attack
technique can satisfy. In this paper, we are the first to study adversarial
machine learning attacks against the complete visual perception pipeline in
autonomous driving, and discover a novel attack technique, tracker hijacking,
that can effectively fool MOT using AEs on object detection. Using our
technique, successful AEs on as few as one single frame can move an existing
object in to or out of the headway of an autonomous vehicle to cause potential
safety hazards. We perform evaluation using the Berkeley Deep Drive dataset and
find that on average when 3 frames are attacked, our attack can have a nearly
100% success rate while attacks that blindly target object detection only have
up to 25%.

images, is a challenging problem recently subject to intense research. Through
careful modelling of the data distribution of normal samples, it is possible to
detect deviant samples, so called anomalies. Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) can model the highly complex, high-dimensional data distribution of
normal image samples, and have shown to be a suitable approach to the problem.
Previously published GAN-based anomaly detection methods often assume that
anomaly-free data is available for training. However, this assumption is not
valid in most real-life scenarios, a.k.a. in the wild. In this work, we
evaluate the effects of anomaly contaminations in the training data on
state-of-the-art GAN-based anomaly detection methods. As expected, detection
performance deteriorates. To address this performance drop, we propose to add
an additional encoder network already at training time and show that joint
generator-encoder training stratifies the latent space, mitigating the problem
with contaminated data. We show experimentally that the norm of a query image
in this stratified latent space becomes a highly significant cue to
discriminate anomalies from normal data. The proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 as well as on a large, previously
untested dataset with cell images.

management systems, has been often established as an example of
self-organization, with code growing and evolving organically, through
activities that do not stem from entralized power, leader or directives. The
main challenge in proving these claims is that self organization cannot be
detected through direct observation, but through measurements on the system,
looking for hints such as the existence of power laws over some features, such
as the size of changes over time. The problem we intend to tackle in this paper
is to establish a methodology for checking, for a chosen set of repositories we
had already measured in the past, if the claims about power laws actually hold
from a precise mathematical point of view, since, although shown as pervasive
in the software engineering literature (and others), power laws are more
elusive than they might seem at first sight. For that reason, in this paper we
present a statistically accurate set of tests that will help us decide, from
the way repositories are changing, if they are really distributed by a power
law, which could indicate us the existence of a state reached via
self-organization, or actually, how accurately a power law fits the observed
distribution of the size of changes of commits in git repositories of 16 open
source repositories. We revisit one of the most representative papers of these
observations to reevaluate its results and compare them with the current status

the impact of high scale theory, if any, at some low energy by incorporating
higher mass dimensional ($\geq 5$) effective operators ($\mathcal{O}_i$). The
low energy EFT is described in terms of only light degrees of freedom which can
appear on-shell. An essential task while developing the EFT framework is to
compute these $\mathcal{O}_i$'s. Hilbert Series is a novel and mathematically
robust method to construct the complete set of gauge invariant independent,
effective operators. The HS requires the knowledge of the transformation
properties of the light DOF and the covariant derivatives under the internal
gauge symmetries and conformal groups. The Hilbert Series method, by its
virtue, automatically takes care of the redundancies in the operator set due to
the Equations of Motion of fields and Integration by Parts with impeccable
accuracy. In this paper, we have adopted this methodology to construct the
complete set of independent operators up to dimension-6 in the ``Warsaw""-like
basis for two different Beyond Standard Model scenarios -- 2HDM and MLRSM. For
both these cases, we have calculated the corrections to the scalar, gauge boson
and fermion mass spectra due to the dimension-6 operators. The additional
contributions to all the Feynman vertices are computed and their impact on
different observables, namely Weak mixing angle, Fermi constant, $\rho$ and
oblique parameters. We have further discussed how the magnetic moments of
charged leptons and production and decay of the massive BSM particles, e.g.,
charged scalar and different rare processes are affected in the presence of
effective operators. We have also constructed the effective scalar four-point
interactions and commented on the possible reinvestigation of the theoretical
constraints, e.g., unitarity and vacuum stability within these frameworks.

the unique optimal collusion matching which is farsightedly stable, under the
following assumptions: (i) the sole utility in the Game is the rank of the
match in own preference list (in particular, proposers are indifferent as to
how other proposers fare); (ii) proposers make proposals iff farsightedly such
plays would strictly improve their own outcome (thus proposers cooperate by
refraining from making proposals which can only harm others, but not strictly
help them; also, they cannot make concessions to others which harm themselves).
We argue that this optimal outcome is actually stronger than a Strong Nash

one member a strictly better outcome under these assumptions.We also show why
some prior results pertaining to collusion of proposers do not always yield a

We provide for this SR method an understanding from action principle and
information geometry aspects. With this quantum state, we calculate key

$O((\ln^6N/\epsilon^2N)^{1/2\alpha})$ error without knowledge of $\alpha$ and
the error rate is near-optimal in the sense that any mechanism incurs

extensive search, which is needed by many non-learning approaches. Recently,
Value Iteration Networks (VINs) received much interest since---in contrast to
standard CNN-based architectures---they learn goal-directed behaviors which
generalize well to unseen domains. However, VINs are restricted to small and
low-dimensional domains, limiting their applicability to real-world planning
problems.
  To address this issue, we propose to extend VINs to representations with
multiple levels of abstraction. While the vicinity of the robot is represented
in sufficient detail, the representation gets spatially coarser with increasing
distance from the robot. The information loss caused by the decreasing
resolution is compensated by increasing the number of features representing a
cell. We show that our approach is capable of solving significantly larger 2D
grid world planning tasks than the original VIN implementation. In contrast to
a multiresolution coarse-to-fine VIN implementation which does not employ
additional descriptive features, our approach is capable of solving challenging
environments, which demonstrates that the proposed method learns to encode
useful information in the additional features. As an application for solving
real-world planning tasks, we successfully employ our method to plan
omnidirectional driving for a search-and-rescue robot in cluttered terrain.

It
provides abstractions that enable administrators to setup their computer
systems declaratively. Its use suffers from two potential pitfalls. First, if
ordering constraints are not specified whenever an abstraction depends on
another, the non-deterministic application of abstractions can lead to race
conditions. Second, if a service is not tied to its resources through
notification constructs, the system may operate in a stale state whenever a
resource gets modified. Such faults can degrade a computing infrastructure's
availability and functionality.
  We have developed an approach that identifies these issues through the
analysis of a Puppet program and its system call trace. Specifically, we
present a formal model for traces, which allows us to capture the interactions
of Puppet abstractions with the file system. By analyzing these interactions we
identify (1) abstractions that are related to each other (e.g., operate on the
same file), and (2) abstractions that should act as notifiers so that changes
are correctly propagated. We then check the relationships from the trace's
analysis against the program's dependency graph: a representation containing
all the ordering constraints and notifications declared in the program. If a
mismatch is detected, our system reports a potential fault.
  We have evaluated our method on a large set of Puppet modules, and discovered
57 previously unknown issues in 30 of them. Benchmarking further shows that our

the first to view numerical PDE solvers as an MDP and to use (deep) RL to learn
new solvers. As proof of concept, we focus on 1-dimensional scalar conservation
laws. We deploy the machinery of deep reinforcement learning to train a policy
network that can decide on how the numerical solutions should be approximated
in a sequential and spatial-temporal adaptive manner. We will show that the
problem of solving conservation laws can be naturally viewed as a sequential
decision-making process, and the numerical schemes learned in such a way can
easily enforce long-term accuracy. Furthermore, the learned policy network is
carefully designed to determine a good local discrete approximation based on
the current state of the solution, which essentially makes the proposed method
a meta-learning approach. In other words, the proposed method is capable of
learning how to discretize for a given situation mimicking human experts.
Finally, we will provide details on how the policy network is trained, how well

the overall supply chain profit, each supplier makes a profit equal to their
marginal contribution to the supply chain, and the buyer takes the remaining

galaxy NGC 1316 at kpc-resolution performed with the Morita Array of the
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We reveal the detailed
distribution of the molecular gas in the central region for the first time: a
shell structure in the northwest, a barely resolved blob in the southeast of
the center and some clumps between them. The total molecular gas mass obtained
with a standard Milky-Way CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor is $(5.62 \pm
0.53)\times10^8$ M$_\odot$, which is consistent with previous studies. The
disturbed velocity field of the molecular gas suggests that the molecular gas
is injected very recently ($<1$ Gyr) if it has an external origin and is in the
process of settling into a rotating disk. Assuming that a low-mass gas-rich
galaxy has accreted, the gas-to-dust ratio and H$_2$-to-HI ratio are unusually
low ($\sim 28$) and high ($\sim 5.6$), respectively. To explain these ratios,
additional processes should be taken into accounts such as an effective dust
formation and conversion from atomic to molecular gas during the interaction.
We also discuss the interaction between the nuclear jet and the molecular gas.

  average",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We examine the dispersion of a passive scalar released in an incompressible
fluid flow in an unbounded domain. The flow is assumed to be spatially
periodic, with zero spatial average, and random in time, in the manner of the
random-phase alternating sine flow which we use as an exemplar. In the
long-time limit, the scalar concentration takes the same, predictable form for
almost all realisations of the flow, with a Gaussian core characterised by an
effective diffusivity, and large-deviation tails characterised by a rate
function (which can be evaluated by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent of
a family of random-in-time partial differential equations). We contrast this
single-realisation description with that which applies to the average of the
concentration over an ensemble of flow realisations. We show that the
single-realisation and ensemble-average effective diffusivities are identical
but that the corresponding rate functions are not, and that the
ensemble-averaged description overestimates the concentration in the tails
compared with that obtained for single-flow realisations. This difference has a
marked impact for scalars reacting according to the
Fisher--Kolmogorov--Petrovskii--Piskunov (FKPP) model. Such scalars form an
expanding front whose shape is approximately independent of the flow
realisation and can be deduced from the single-realisation large-deviation rate
function. We test our predictions against numerical simulations of the
alternating sine flow.

galaxy are now feasible, and they are being employed as diagnostic tools to
study star-formation activities there. However, the spatial resolution
attainable for a nearby galaxy with currently available radio telescopes is
$10-1000$ pc, which is much larger than the scales of individual star-forming
regions and molecular cloud cores. Hence, it is of fundamental importance to
elucidate which part of an interstellar medium such spatially-unresolved
observations are tracing. Here we present sensitive measurements of the H$_2$CO
($1_{01}-0_{00}$) line at 72 GHz toward giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in the
spiral arm of M51 using the NRO 45 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes. In conjunction
with the previously observed H$_2$CO ($2_{02}-1_{01}$) and CS ($2-1$ and $3-2$)
lines, we derive the H$_2$ density of the emitting regions to be
$(0.6-2.6)\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and $(2.9-12)\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ for H$_2$CO
and CS, respectively, by the non-LTE analyses, where we assume the source size
of $0.8-1$ kpc and the gas kinetic temperature of $10-20$ K. The derived H$_2$
density indicates that the emission of H$_2$CO and CS is not localized to
star-forming cores, but is likely distributed over an entire region of GMCs.
Such widespread distributions of H$_2$CO and CS are also supported by models
assuming lognormal density distributions over the 1 kpc region. Thus,
contributions from the widespread less-dense components should be taken into
account for interpretation of these molecular emission observed with a
GMC-scale resolution. The different H$_2$ densities derived for H$_2$CO and CS
imply their different distributions. We discuss this differences in terms of
the formation processes of H$_2$CO and CS.

well a difference in effectiveness reflects an actual difference between

According to recent surveys on SIGIR, CIKM, ECIR and TOIS papers, the t-test is
the most popular choice among IR researchers. However, previous work has
suggested computer intensive tests like the bootstrap or the permutation test,
based mainly on theoretical arguments. On empirical grounds, others have
suggested non-parametric alternatives such as the Wilcoxon test. Indeed, the
question of which tests we should use has accompanied IR and related fields for
decades now. Previous theoretical studies on this matter were limited in that
we know that test assumptions are not met in IR experiments, and empirical
studies were limited in that we do not have the necessary control over the null
hypotheses to compute actual Type I and Type II error rates under realistic
conditions. Therefore, not only is it unclear which test to use, but also how
much trust we should put in them. In contrast to past studies, in this paper we
employ a recent simulation methodology from TREC data to go around these
limitations. Our study comprises over 500 million p-values computed for a range
of tests, systems, effectiveness measures, topic set sizes and effect sizes,
and for both the 2-tail and 1-tail cases. Having such a large supply of IR
evaluation data with full knowledge of the null hypotheses, we are finally in a

lattice rotational symmetry without breaking time reversal symmetry leading to
a nematic phase just above magnetic ordering temperature. We present
high-resolution calorimetric and magnetization data of the same Ba2NaOsO6

occurring at a temperature of Ts ~ 9.5K, above the magnetic ordering
temperature of Tc ~ 7.5K. This transition appears as a broadened step in the
low-field temperature dependence of the specific heat. The evolution of the
phase boundary with applied magnetic field suggests that this phase coincides
with the phase of broken local point symmetry seen in high field NMR
experiments [Lu et al., Nat.\ Comm. 8 14407 (2017)]. Furthermore, the magnetic
field dependence of the specific heat provides clear indications for magnetic
correlations persisting at temperatures between Tc and Ts where long-range
magnetic order is absent giving support for the existence of the proposed
nematic phase.

approach mainly refer to acceleration equations, i.e. differential equations of
velocities. They are directly from the Euler-Lagrangian equations, and usually
have higher-order terms truncated when they remain at the same post-Newtonian
order of the Lagrangian. In this sense, they are incoherent equations of the
Lagrangian and approximately conserve constants of motion in this system. In
this paper, we show that the Euler-Lagrangian equations can also yield the
equations of motion for consistency of the Lagrangian in the general case. The
coherent equations are the \emph{differential} equations of generalized momenta
rather than those of the velocities, and have no terms truncated. The
velocities are not integration variables, but they can be solved from the
\emph{algebraic} equations of the generalized momenta with an iterative method.
Taking weak relativistic fields in the Solar System and strong relativistic
fields of compact objects as examples, we numerically evaluate the accuracies
of the constants of motion in the two sets of equations of motion. It is
confirmed that these accuracies well satisfy the theoretical need if the chosen
integrator can provide a high enough precision. The differences in the
dynamical behavior of order and chaos between the two sets of equations are
also compared. Unlike the incoherent post-Newtonian Lagrangian equations of
motion, the coherent ones can theoretically, strictly conserve all integrals in
some post-Newtonian Lagrangian problems, and therefore are worth recommending.

for future wireless networks with cell-free massive multiple-input
multiple-output (CF massive MIMO) network, where a large number of remote
antenna units (RAUs), either using half-duplex or full-duplex, jointly support
truly flexible duplex including time-division duplex, frequency-division duplex
and full duplex on demand of uplink and downlink traffic by using network MIMO
methods. With NAFD, bi-directional data rates of the wireless network could be
increased and end-to-end delay could be reduced. In this paper, the spectral
efficiency of NAFD communications in CF massive MIMO network with imperfect
channel state information (CSI) is investigated under spatial correlated
channels. Based on large dimensional random matrix theory, the deterministic
equivalents for the uplink sum-rate with minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE)
receiver as well as the downlink sum-rate with zero-forcing (ZF) and
regularized zero-forcing (RZF) beamforming are derived. Numerical results show
that under various environmental settings, the deterministic equivalents are
accurate in both a large-scale system and system with a finite number of
antennas. It is also shown that with the downlink-to-uplink interference
cancellation, the uplink spectral efficiency of CF massive MIMO with NAFD could
be improved. The spectral efficiencies of NAFD with different duplex
configurations such as in-band full-duplex, and half-duplex are compared. With
the same total numbers of transmit and receive antennas, NAFD with half-duplex
RAUs offers a higher spectral efficiency. To alleviate the uplink-to-downlink
interference, a novel genetic algorithm based user scheduling strategy (GAS) is
proposed. Simulation results show that the achievable downlink sum-rate by
using the GAS is greatly improved compared to that by using the random user

especially in environments with high-dimensional, continuous observations and
unknown dynamics. Supervised learning methods based on behavioral cloning (BC)
suffer from distribution shift: because the agent greedily imitates
demonstrated actions, it can drift away from demonstrated states due to error
accumulation. Recent methods based on reinforcement learning (RL), such as
inverse RL and generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL), overcome this
issue by training an RL agent to match the demonstrations over a long horizon.
Since the true reward function for the task is unknown, these methods learn a
reward function from the demonstrations, often using complex and brittle
approximation techniques that involve adversarial training. We propose a simple
alternative that still uses RL, but does not require learning a reward
function. The key idea is to provide the agent with an incentive to match the
demonstrations over a long horizon, by encouraging it to return to demonstrated
states upon encountering new, out-of-distribution states. We accomplish this by
giving the agent a constant reward of r=+1 for matching the demonstrated action
in a demonstrated state, and a constant reward of r=0 for all other behavior.
Our method, which we call soft Q imitation learning (SQIL), can be implemented
with a handful of minor modifications to any standard Q-learning or off-policy
actor-critic algorithm. Theoretically, we show that SQIL can be interpreted as
a regularized variant of BC that uses a sparsity prior to encourage
long-horizon imitation. Empirically, we show that SQIL outperforms BC and
achieves competitive results compared to GAIL, on a variety of image-based and
low-dimensional tasks in Box2D, Atari, and MuJoCo.

practice. Recent effective approaches to few-shot learning employ a
metric-learning framework to learn a feature similarity comparison between a
query (test) example, and the few support (training) examples. However, these
approaches treat each support class independently from one another, never
looking at the entire task as a whole. Because of this, they are constrained to
use a single set of features for all possible test-time tasks, which hinders
the ability to distinguish the most relevant dimensions for the task at hand.

important problem in the field of active turbulence. Using a continuum model
that applies well to bacterial suspensions, we investigate the role of Ekmann
friction on the transport of passive (Lagrangian) tracers that go with the
local flow. We find that the crossover from ballistic to diffusive regime
happens at a time scale $\tau_c$ that attains a minimum at zero friction,
meaning that both injection and dissipation of energy delay the relaxation of
tracers. We explain this by proposing that $\tau_c \sim 2
\ell^*/u_{\text{rms}}$, where $\ell^*$ is a dominant length scale extracted
from energy spectrum peak, and $u_{\text{rms}}$ is a velocity scale that sets
the kinetic energy at steady state, both scales monotonically decrease with
friction. Finally, we predict robust scaling laws for $\ell^*$,
$u_{\text{rms}}$ and the diffusion coefficient $\mathcal{D} \sim \ell^*
u_{\text{rms}} / 2$, that are valid over a wide range of fluid friction. Our
findings might be relevant to transport phenomena in a generic active fluid.

improvement of TNSA performance results from more efficient hot-electron

increased effective interaction area and duration. We show that TNSA is
optimized for a nanohole distribution of relatively low areal density and that

ones and diffuse into a ferromagnet over a long distance in a phenomenon known
as the long-range proximity effect (LRPE). This happens in materials with
inhomogeneous magnetism or spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Most of the previous
studies focus on the cases with small SOC and exchange field. However, the
physics was not clear when SOC and exchange field strength are both much
greater than the disorder strength. In this work, we consider a two dimensional
system with a large Rashba-type SOC and exchange field in the case where only
one band is partially occupied. We develop a generalized quasiclassical theory
by projecting the Green function onto the partially occupied band (POB). We
find that when the SOC energy scale is comparable with the exchange field,
there is no LRPE. The reason is that the nonmagnetic impurities together with
the large SOC and exchange field can effectively generate spin-flip scattering,
which suppresses the proximity effect. We also show that when increasing either
SOC or exchange field, the decay length of superconducting correlations can be
significantly increased due to an approximately restored time reversal symmetry
or spin rotation symmetry around the $z$ (out-of-plane) axis.

measure the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNN). It was shown that

Unfortunately, many simple instances of graphs are indistinguishable by the
1-WL test.
  In search for more expressive graph learning models we build upon the recent
k-order invariant and equivariant graph neural networks (Maron et al. 2019a,b)
and present two results:
  First, we show that such k-order networks can distinguish between
non-isomorphic graphs as good as the k-WL tests, which are provably stronger
than the 1-WL test for k>2. This makes these models strictly stronger than
message passing models. Unfortunately, the higher expressiveness of these
models comes with a computational cost of processing high order tensors.
  Second, setting our goal at building a provably stronger, simple and scalable
model we show that a reduced 2-order network containing just scaled identity
operator, augmented with a single quadratic operation (matrix multiplication)
has a provable 3-WL expressive power. Differently put, we suggest a simple
model that interleaves applications of standard Multilayer-Perceptron (MLP)
applied to the feature dimension and matrix multiplication. We validate this
model by presenting state of the art results on popular graph classification

minimum. A smooth incline in charging occurs for larger pressures. Toward lower

to a model where the maximum charge is limited by a gas discharge occurring

ambient temperatures or by convention below 100 C. Owing to their numerous
valuable physicochemical properties as bulk liquids, solvents, at surfaces and
in confined environments, ILs have attracted increasing attention in both
academic and industrial communities in a variety of application areas involving
physics, chemistry, material science and engineering. Due to their nearly
limitless number of combinations of cation and anion pairs and mixtures with
cosolvents, a molecular level understanding of their hierarchical structures
and dynamics, requiring strategies to connect several length and time scales,
is of crucial significance for rational design of ILs with desired properties,
and thereafter refining their functional performance in applications. As an
invaluable compliment to experiments from synthesis to characterization,
computational modelling and simulations have significantly increased our
understanding on how physicochemical and structural properties of ILs can be
controlled by their underlying chemical and molecular structures. In this
chapter, we will give examples from our own modelling work based on selected IL
systems, with focus on imidazolium based and tetraalkylphosphonium orthoborate
ILs, studied at several spatiotemporal scales in different environments and
with particular attention to applications of high technological interest.

confidential messages to a set of distributed ground nodes (GNs) that can
cooperate in signal detection, in the presence of several colluding suspicious
eavesdroppers. Different from prior works considering the two-dimensional (2D)
horizontal trajectory design in the non-CoMP scenario, this paper additionally
exploits the UAV's vertical trajectory (or altitude) control for further
improving the secrecy communication performance with CoMP. In particular, we
jointly optimize the three dimensional (3D) trajectory and transmit power
allocation of the UAV to maximize the average secrecy rate at GNs over a
particular flight period, subject to the UAV's maximum flight speed and maximum
transmit power constraints. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we
propose an alternating-optimization-based approach, which optimizes the
transmit power allocation and trajectory design in an alternating manner, by
convex optimization and successive convex approximation (SCA), respectively.
Numerical results show that in the scenario with CoMP reception, our proposed
3D trajectory optimization significantly outperforms the conventional 2D
horizontal trajectory design, by exploiting the additional degree of freedom in

cast as path planning problems with side-observations (SOPPP): at each stage, a
learner chooses a path on a directed acyclic graph and suffers the sum of
losses that are adversarially assigned to the corresponding edges; and she then
receives semi-bandit feedback with side-observations (i.e., she observes the
losses on the chosen edges plus some others). We propose a novel algorithm,
EXP3-OE, the first-of-its-kind with guaranteed efficient running time for SOPPP

out that with 1000 hours of data-taking, SKA1-MID will be able to exclude up to

enhancement due to a DM-spike associated with an intermediate-mass black hole

candidates, dubbed branons. In this specific scenario, SKA allows us to set
constraints on the branon parameter space ($f$,$M$), where $f$ is related to
the coupling of the branon to the Standard Model particles and $M$ is the mass
of the branon itself. In particular, we consider two different branon DM
candidates. We find out that SKA will be able to set more stringent constraints

array to measure HD113337 angular diameter, and derived its linear radius using
the Gaia parallax. We computed the bolometric flux to derive its effective
temperature and luminosity, and we estimated its mass and age using
evolutionary tracks. We used Herschel images to partially resolve the outer

RV of the star using the MESS2 software to bring upper mass limits on possible

on the age and inclination (brought by the fundamental parameter analysis and
the disk imaging, respectively). We derive a limb-darkened angular diameter of
0.386 $\pm$ 0.009 mas that converts into a linear radius of 1.50 $\pm$ 0.04
solar radius. The fundamental parameter analysis leads to an effective

Noise (LFN) due to its upconversion to undesired phase noise at higher
frequencies. Such applications demand the use of short channel graphene
transistors that operate at high electric fields in order to ensure a high
speed. Electric field is inversely proportional to device length and
proportional to channel potential so it gets maximized as the drain voltage
increases and the transistor length shrinks. Under these conditions though,
short channel effects like Velocity Saturation (VS) should be taken into
account. Carrier number and mobility fluctuations have been proved to be the
main sources that generate LFN in graphene devices. While their contribution to
the bias dependence of LFN in long channels has been thoroughly investigated,
the way in which VS phenomenon affects LFN in short channel devices under high
drain voltage conditions has not been well understood. At low electric field
operation, VS effect is negligible since carriers velocity is far away from
being saturated. Under these conditions, LFN can be precicely predicted by a
recently established physics-based analytical model. The present paper goes a
step furher and proposes a new model which deals with the contribution of VS
effect on LFN under high electric field conditions. The implemented model is
validated with novel experimental data, published for the first time, from CVD
grown back-gated single layer graphene transistors operating at gigahertz
frequencies. The model accurately captures the reduction of LFN especially near
charge neutrality point because of the effect of VS mechanism. Moreover, an
analytical expression for the effect of contact resistance on LFN is derived.
This contact resistance contribution is experimentally shown to be dominant at
higher gate voltages and is accurately described by the proposed model.

reconsider the two prevalent approaches in the literature, that of Moon and
Perron (2004) and the PANIC setup proposed in Bai and Ng (2004). While these
have been considered as completely different setups, we show that, in case of
Gaussian innovations, the frameworks are asymptotically equivalent in the sense
that both experiments are locally asymptotically normal (LAN) with the same
central sequence. Using Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments we determine
the local asymptotic power envelope and derive an optimal test jointly in both
setups. We show that the popular Moon and Perron (2004) and Bai and Ng (2010)
tests only attain the power envelope in case there is no heterogeneity in the
long-run variance of the idiosyncratic components. The new test is
asymptotically uniformly most powerful irrespective of possible heterogeneity.
Moreover, it turns out that for any test, satisfying a mild regularity
condition, the size and local asymptotic power are the same under both data
generating processes. Thus, applied researchers do not need to decide on one of
the two frameworks to conduct unit root tests. Monte-Carlo simulations
corroborate our asymptotic results and document significant gains in
finite-sample power if the variances of the idiosyncratic shocks differ
substantially among the cross sectional units.

regarded as unpredictable and hardly controllable due to the noise-like nature
of the qCWB, and relevant previous studies thus lack a clear understanding of
their underlying mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that the qCWB landscape can
be manipulated via optoacoustically mediated interactions between the qCWB and
mode-locked pulses, which dramatically alters the behaviors of multi-pulse

are created at well-defined temporal locations, which act as the point emitters
and attractive potentials for drifting pulse bunches and soliton rains. Hence,
we can transport a single pulse bunch from a certain temporal position to
another on the qCWB, and also make the soliton rain created and collided
exclusively at specific temporal locations, in sharp contrast to the
conventional cases. Our study opens up new possibilities to control the
nonequilibrium multi-pulse phenomena precisely in the time domain, which would
not only help the observation and clear understanding of undiscovered features

control of the robotic system for surgery, in which current systems offer the
control or two robotic arms teleoperated by the surgeon's hands. To relax the
need for surgical assistants and augment dexterity in surgery, it has been
recently proposed to use a robot like a third arm that can be controlled
seamlessly, independently from the natural arms, and work together with them.
This report will develop and investigate this concept by implementing foot
control of a robotic surgical arm. A novel passive haptic foot-machine
interface system and analysis of its performances were introduced in this
report. This interface using a parallel-serial hybrid structure with springs
and force sensors, which allows intuitive control of a slave robotic arm with
four degrees of freedom (dof). The elastic isometric design enables a user to
control the interface system accurately and adaptively, with an enlarged
sensing range breaking the physical restriction of the pedal size. A subject
specific (independent component analysis, ICA) model is identified to map the
surgeon's foot movements into kinematic parameters of the slave robotic arm. To
validate the system and assess the performance it allows, 10 subjects carried
out experiments to manipulate the foot-machine interface system in various
movements. With these experimental data, the mapping models were built and
verified. A comparison between different mapping models was made and analyzed
proving the ICA algorithm is obviously dominant over other methods.

the shell gaps and validity of the seniority scheme in the neutron-rich
systems. We explore the robustness of the N=82 and N=126 magic numbers in the
neutron-rich 130Cd and 206Hg nuclides, respectively. A parallel between the two
nuclides in terms of the high-spin isomers allows us to investigate these
waiting-point nuclei, which have limited experimental data, by using the
concept of seniority as the stepping stone. In this paper, we report large
scale shell model calculations by using the available realistic effective
interactions derived from the Charge Dependent Bonn potential through the
renormalized G matrix. We also explore if any change in the interaction is also
required to consistently explain both the level structures as well the B(E2)
values. A structural similarity between the 8+ isomer in 130Cd and the 10+
isomer in 206Hg is noticed due to goodness of seniority. They are found to
possess a maximally aligned, seniority v = 2 configuration from their
respective intruder orbits. No shell quenching seems to be needed for the
seniority isomers in these nuclei. Therefore, N=82 and 126 appear to be very
robust magic numbers even in the neutron-rich region.

approach often called boundary value testing or analysis (BVA). Even though
this has been a key testing idea for long it has been hard to clearly define
and formalize. Consequently, it has also been hard to automate.
  In this research note we propose one such formalization of BVA by, in a
similar way as to how the derivative of a function is defined in mathematics,
considering (software) program derivatives. Critical to our definition is the
notion of distance between inputs and outputs which we can formalize and then
quantify based on ideas from Information theory.
  However, for our (black-box) approach to be practical one must search for
test inputs with specific properties. Coupling it with search-based software
engineering is thus required and we discuss how program derivatives can be used
as and within fitness functions.
  This brief note does not allow a deeper, empirical investigation but we use a
simple illustrative example throughout to introduce the main ideas. By
combining program derivatives with search, we thus propose a practical as well
as theoretically interesting technique for automated boundary value (analysis

challenging task. We tackle this challenge by proposing a new appointment
scheduling policy for such clinics that does not require significant

emergency patients. Emergency patients must be seen on arrival, and inpatients
must be given next day appointments. Outpatients, however, can be given later
appointments. The proposed policy takes advantage of this by allowing the
postponement of the acceptance of appointment requests from outpatients. The
appointment scheduling process is modeled as a two-stage stochastic programming
problem where a portion of the clinic capacity is allocated to inpatients and
emergency patients in the first stage. In the second stage, outpatients are
scheduled based on their priority classes. After a detailed analysis of the
solutions obtained from the two-stage stochastic model, we develop a simple,
non-anticipative policy for patient scheduling. We evaluate the performance of
this proposed, easy-to-implement policy in a simulation study which shows
significant improvements in outpatient indirect waiting times.

Acoustic Oscillations, Cosmic Microwave Background, Gamma-Ray burst and the the
local value of the Hubble constant. We examine the THDE model to check its
compatibility with observational data using objective Information Criterion

Using the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) test we check the deviation of the model

$v^2_s$ as an another test we check the stability of the interacting and

magnetic field has little influence on the acoustic current. In contrast, the
SAW induced transverse voltage shows significant dependence on the relative

angle dependent voltage resembles that of the planar Hall voltage induced by

often identify communities in the system's network of interactions. Because it
is practically impossible to explore all solutions to guarantee the best one,
many community-detection algorithms rely on multiple stochastic searches. But
for a given combination of network and stochastic algorithm, how many searches
are sufficient to find a solution that is good enough? The standard approach is
to pick a reasonably large number of searches and select the network partition
with the highest quality or derive a consensus solution based on all network
partitions. However, if different partitions have similar qualities such that
the solution landscape is degenerate, the single best partition may miss
relevant information, and a consensus solution may blur complementary
communities. Here we address this degeneracy problem with coarse-grained
descriptions of the solution landscape. We cluster network partitions based on
their similarity and suggest an approach to determine the minimum number of
searches required to describe the solution landscape adequately. To make good
use of all partitions, we also propose different ways to explore the solution
landscape, including a significance clustering procedure. We test these
approaches on synthetic networks and a real-world network using two contrasting
community-detection algorithms: The algorithm that can identify more general
structures requires more searches and networks with clearer community
structures require fewer searches. We also find that exploring the
coarse-grained solution landscape can reveal complementary solutions and enable

  DM has two main merits. First, loss function and example weighting are common

example weighting) and is a replacement of both. Second, despite that a loss
defines an example weighting scheme by its derivative, in the loss design, we
need to consider whether it is differentiable. Instead, DM is more flexible by
directly modifying the derivative so that a loss can be a non-elementary format

non-conservation of energy-momentum, with possible implications for the
cosmological constant problem. It is then important to study the predictions of
unimodular gravity in other gravitational regimes. In this work we study
stellar dynamics under the assumption of non-conserved energy-momentum. We find
that constant density objects can be as compact as Schwarzschild black holes.
For polytropic objects, we find modifications due to the non-conservation of
energy-momentum that lead to sizeable effects that could be constrained with
observational data. Additionally, we revisit and clarify the
Reissner-Nordstr\""om solution in unimodular gravity. We also study
gravitational collapse and discuss possible implications for the growth of
structure.

model is based on a novel approach to the reconstruction of probability
densities from their kernel mean embeddings by drawing connections to
estimation of Radon-Nikodym derivatives in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space
(RKHS). We prove finite sample bounds for the estimation error in a standard
density reconstruction scenario, independent of problem dimensionality.
Interestingly, when a kernel is used that is also a probability density, the
CDO allows us to both evaluate and sample the output density efficiently. We
demonstrate the versatility and performance of the proposed model on both
synthetic and real-world data.

accurate classification results, 50 different features are extracted from the

suitable subset is chosen and passed to random forest and long short-term

Moreover, it is shown why data imbalance is an inherent problem in automotive
radar classification when the dataset is not sufficiently large. To overcome
this issue, classifier binarization is used among other techniques in order to
better account for underrepresented classes. A new method to couple the

IRAS23385+6053, which is believed to be the least evolved source of the CORE
sample. The observations were performed at ~1.4 mm and employed three
configurations of NOEMA and additional single-dish maps, merged with the
interferometric data to recover the extended emission. Our correlator setup
covered a number of lines from well-known hot core tracers and a few outflow
tracers. The angular (~0.45""$-$0.9"") and spectral (0.5 km/s) resolutions were
sufficient to resolve the clump in IRAS23385+6053 and investigate the existence
of large-scale motions due to rotation, infall, or expansion. We find that the
clump splits into six distinct cores when observed at sub-arcsecond resolution.
These are identified through their 1.4 mm continuum and molecular line
emission. We produce maps of the velocity, line width, and rotational
temperature from the methanol and methyl cyanide lines, which allow us to
investigate the cores and reveal a velocity and temperature gradient in the
most massive core. We also find evidence of a bipolar outflow, possibly powered
by a low-mass star. We present the tentative detection of a circumstellar
self-gravitating disk lying in the most massive core and powering a large-scale
outflow previously known in the literature. In our scenario, the star powering
the flow is responsible for most of the luminosity of IRAS23385+6053
(~$3000~L_\odot$). The other cores, albeit with masses below the corresponding
virial masses, appear to be accreting material from their molecular
surroundings and are possibly collapsing or on the verge of collapse. We
conclude that we are observing a sample of star-forming cores that is bound to
turn into a cluster of massive stars.

systems. It determines how to respond to users. The recently proposed deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches have been used for policy optimization.
However, these deep models are still challenging for two reasons: 1) Many
DRL-based policies are not sample-efficient. 2) Most models don't have the
capability of policy transfer between different domains. In this paper, we
propose a universal framework, AgentGraph, to tackle these two problems. The
proposed AgentGraph is the combination of GNN-based architecture and DRL-based
algorithm. It can be regarded as one of the multi-agent reinforcement learning
approaches. Each agent corresponds to a node in a graph, which is defined
according to the dialogue domain ontology. When making a decision, each agent
can communicate with its neighbors on the graph. Under AgentGraph framework, we
further propose Dual GNN-based dialogue policy, which implicitly decomposes the
decision in each turn into a high-level global decision and a low-level local
decision. Experiments show that AgentGraph models significantly outperform
traditional reinforcement learning approaches on most of the 18 tasks of the
PyDial benchmark. Moreover, when transferred from the source task to a target
task, these models not only have acceptable initial performance but also
converge much faster on the target task.

stochastic gradients. In a single theorem we establish a linear convergence
result under this assumption and strong-quasi convexity of the loss function.
Whenever we recover an existing method as a special case, our theorem gives the
best known complexity result. Our approach can be used to motivate the
development of new useful methods, and offers pre-proved convergence

their subtle differences give rise to different behaviour. Here we survey a new
approach in dimension theory, which seeks to unify the study of individual
dimensions by viewing them as different facets of the same object. For example,
given two notions of dimension, one may be able to define a continuously
parameterised family of dimensions which interpolates between them. An
understanding of this `interpolation function' therefore contains more
information about a given object than the two dimensions considered in
isolation. We pay particular attention to two concrete examples of this, namely
the \emph{Assouad spectrum}, which interpolates between the box and
(quasi-)Assouad dimension, and the \emph{intermediate dimensions}, which
interpolate between the Hausdorff and box dimensions.

However, existing methods are not applicable to massive graphs due to two
serious weaknesses. (1) It is difficult to fully reproduce ground-truth
clusters due to the resolution limit problem. (2) They are computationally
expensive because all nodes and edges must be computed iteratively. This paper
proposes gScarf, which outputs fine-grained clusters within a short running
time. To overcome the aforementioned weaknesses, gScarf dynamically prunes
unnecessary nodes and edges, ensuring that it captures fine-grained clusters.
Experiments show that gScarf outperforms existing methods in terms of running
time while finding clusters with high accuracy.

  Our main result is that the two classes are equal, i.e., MIP$^* =$

Ben-Or, Goldwasser, Kilian, and Wigderson (STOC 1988) who show that MIP $=$

assumption that links capture direct influence, and that paths represent
possible indirect influence. This assumption is invalidated in time-stamped
network data capturing, e.g., dynamic social networks, biological sequences or
financial transactions. In such data, for two time-stamped links (A,B) and
(B,C) the chronological ordering and timing determines whether a causal path
from node A via B to C exists. A number of works has shown that for that reason
network analysis cannot be directly applied to time-stamped network data.
Existing methods to address this issue require statistics on causal paths,
which is computationally challenging for big data sets.
  Addressing this problem, we develop an efficient algorithm to count causal
paths in time-stamped network data. Applying it to empirical data, we show that
our method is more efficient than a baseline method implemented in an
OpenSource data analytics package. Our method works efficiently for different
values of the maximum time difference between consecutive links of a causal
path and supports streaming scenarios. With it, we are closing a gap that
hinders an efficient analysis of big time series data on complex networks.

development of more predictive methods for assessing toxicity and drug or
nutrient absorption. Here, we present an advanced cell culture system able to
mimic the dynamic environment of biological barriers while monitoring cell
behaviour through real-time impedance measurements and imaging. It consists of
a fluidic device with an apical and a basal flow compartment separated by a
semi-permeable membrane. The main features of the device are the integration of
a transepithelial electrical impedance (TEEI) meter and transparent windows for
optical monitoring within a dual flow system. Caco-2 cells were cultured in the
TEEI bioreactor under both flow and static conditions. Although no differences
in the expression of peripheral actin and occludin were visible, the cells in
dynamic conditions developed higher impedance values at low frequencies,
indicative of a higher paracellular electrical impedance and thus suggesting
accelerated barrier and tight junction formation with respect to the static
cultures. TEEI measurements at high frequency also enabled monitoring the
evolution of transcellular impedance during culture. The cells subject to flow
showed a typical RC behaviour, while the controls showed minimal capacitive
behaviour, again highlighting the differences between flow and static
conditions.

that symmetric approximation sequences in $n$-exangulated categories give rise
to derived equivalences between quotient algebras of locally

factorizable ghost and coghost ideals by the locally finite tilting family.
Then we get a class of derived equivalent algebras that have not been obtained
by using previous techniques. From higher exact sequences, we obtain derived
equivalences between subalgebras of endomorphism algebras by constructing
tilting complexes, which generalizes Chen and Xi's result for exact sequences.
From a given derived equivalence, we get derived equivalences between locally
$\Phi$-Beilinson-Green algebras of semi-Gorenstein modules. Finally, from given
graded derived equivalences of group graded algebras, we get derived
equivalences between associated Beilinson-Green algebras of group graded

such as hemoglobin oxygen saturation. However, the real-time application of
this technique in interventional medicine can be challenging due to the long
acquisition times needed for large amounts of hyperspectral data with hundreds
of bands. While this challenge can partially be addressed by choosing a
discriminative subset of bands, the band selection methods proposed to date are
mainly restricted by the availability of often hard to obtain reference
measurements. We address this bottleneck with a new approach to band selection
that leverages highly accurate Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. We hypothesize
that a so chosen small subset of bands can reproduce or even improve upon the
results of a quasi continuous spectral measurement. We further investigate
whether novel domain adaptation techniques can address the inevitable domain
shift stemming from the use of simulations. Initial results based on in silico
and in vivo experiments suggest that 10-20 bands are sufficient to closely
reproduce results from spectral measurements with 101 bands in the 500-700 nm
range. The investigated domain adaptation technique, which only requires
unlabeled in vivo measurements, yielded better results than the pure in silico
band selection method. Overall, our method could guide development of fast
multispectral imaging systems suited for interventional use without relying on
complex hardware setups or manually labeled data

the habitable zone of the host star. Therefore, water can be in liquid state at

planets formed beyond the snow line in a water-rich region. The initial water
reservoir can be lost during the planet formation due to the stellar activity
of the infant low-mass star. However, a potential subsequent water delivery
event, like the late heavy bombardment (LHB) in the Solar System, can replenish
planetary water reservoirs. To study this water delivery process, we set up a
simple model in which an additional 5 M_Earth--50 M_Earth planet is embedded in
a water-rich asteroid belt beyond the snow line of TRAPPIST-1. Asteroids
perturbed out from the chaotic zone of the putative planet can enter into the

larger is the orbital distance of planet, the higher is the amount of water
delivered to the planet by an LHB-like event.

an on-ground three-dimensional (3D) wireless sensor network (WSN).
Specifically, ImgSensingNet first leverages the computer vision technique to
tell the AQI scale in different regions from the taken haze images, where
haze-relevant features and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) are
designed for direct learning between haze images and corresponding AQI scale.
Based on the learnt AQI scale, ImgSensingNet determines whether to wake up
on-ground wireless sensors for small-scale AQI monitoring and inference, which
can greatly reduce the energy consumption of the system. An entropy-based model
is employed for accurate real-time AQI inference at unmeasured locations and
future air quality distribution forecasting. We implement and evaluate
ImgSensingNet on two university campuses since Feb. 2018, and has collected

sources of information about the quark gluon plasma. The fraction of such
particles that survive the plasma phase and reach the detectors is related to
the dissociation degree inside the thermal medium. A consistent picture for the
thermal behavior of charmonium and bottomonium quasi-states in a thermal medium
was obtained recently using a holographic bottom up model. This model captures
the heavy flavour spectroscopy of masses and decay constants in the vacuum
(zero temperature) and is consistently extended to finite temperature. The
spectral functions that emerge provide a description of the dissociation
process in terms of the broadening of the quasi-state peaks with temperature.
  The holographic approach makes it possible to determine also the quasinormal
modes. They are gravity solutions representing the quasi-particle states in the
thermal medium, with complex frequencies related to the thermal mass and width.
The quasinormal modes for charmonium and bottomonium have been studied very
recently and a consistent description of the dissociation process was found.
  An additional factor can affect the dissociation process: strong magnetic
fields are expected to be present when the plasma is formed by non-central
heavy ion collisions. So, it is important to understand the effect of such
fields on the heavy meson dissociation scenario. Here we extend the holographic
determination of quasinormal modes for the case when magnetic fields are
present. The real and imaginary parts of the mode frequencies are determined
for different values of background $e B$ field. The associated dispersion
relations for heavy quarks moving inside the plasma are also investigated for
both $ c \bar c$ and $ b \bar b \, $.

from correlations which are created during the quantum evolution. Here, we

there exist correlation between consecutive uses of quantum channel . Quantum
speed limit time is the bound on the minimal time evolution between initial and

resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) is required during post-acquisition analysis in
order to quantify various aspects of renal function, such as filtration and
perfusion or blood flow. However, this can be obfuscated by the Partial Volume
Effect (PVE), caused due to the mixing of any single voxel with two or more
signal intensities from adjacent regions such as liver region and other
tissues. To avoid this problem, firstly, a kidney region of interest (ROI)
needs to be defined for the analysis. A clinician may choose to select a region
avoiding edges where PV mixing is likely to be significant. However, this
approach is time-consuming and labour intensive. To address this issue, we
present Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) coupled with thresholding and blob
analysis as a framework for automatic delineation of the kidney region. This
method is first validated on synthetically generated data with ground-truth
available and then applied to ten healthy volunteers' kidney DCE-MRI datasets.
We found that the result obtained from our proposed framework is comparable to
that of a human expert. For example, while our result gives an average Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.0097, the baseline achieves an average RMSE of
0.1196 across the 10 datasets. As a result, we conclude automatic modelling via

benchmark experimental data within a Bayesian framework for nuclear data
adjustments and multi-level uncertainty propagation using the Total Monte Carlo
method. First, input parameters to basic nuclear physics models implemented
within the state of the art nuclear reactions code, TALYS, were sampled from
uniform distributions and randomly varied to produce a large set of random
nuclear data files. Next, a probabilistic data assimilation was carried out by
computing the likelihood function for each random nuclear data file based first
on only differential experimental data (1st update) and then on integral
benchmark data (2nd update). The individual likelihood functions from the two
updates were then combined into a global likelihood function which was used for
the selection of the final 'best' file. The proposed method has been applied
for the adjustment of $^{208}$Pb in the fast neutron energy region below 20
MeV. The 'best' file from the adjustments was compared with available
experimental data from the EXFOR database as well as evaluations from the major
nuclear data libraries and found to compare favourably.

features based on the gauge/gravity duality. In this paper, we explore
numerically these two aspects of the higher dimensional holographic
superconductors, in the presence of a Power-Maxwell electrodynamics as the
gauge field. At first, we calculate the critical temperature, condensation,
conductivity, and superconducting gap, in the absence of magnetic field and
disclose the effects of both power parameter, $s$, as well as the spacetime
dimensions, $d$, on this quantities. Then, we immerse the superconductor into
an external magnetic field, $B$, and observe that with increasing the magnetic
field, the starting point of condensation occurs at temperature less than the
critical temperature, $T_{c}$, in the absence of magnetic field. This implies
that at a fixed temperature, we can define a critical magnetic field, above
which the critical temperature goes to zero which is similar to the Meissner
effect in superconductor. In these indications, we also try to show the
distinction of the conformal invariance of the Power-Maxwell Lagrangian that
occurs for $s=d/4$.

perform their compute-heavy inference. This common practice requires sending
private and privileged data over the network to remote servers, exposing it to
the service provider and potentially compromising its privacy. Even if the
provider is trusted, the data can still be vulnerable over communication
channels or via side-channel attacks in the cloud. To that end, this paper aims
to reduce the information content of the communicated data with as little as
possible compromise on the inference accuracy by making the sent data noisy. An
undisciplined addition of noise can significantly reduce the accuracy of
inference, rendering the service unusable. To address this challenge, this
paper devises Shredder, an end-to-end framework, that, without altering the
topology or the weights of a pre-trained network, learns additive noise
distributions that significantly reduce the information content of communicated
data while maintaining the inference accuracy. The key idea is finding the
additive noise distributions by casting it as a disjoint offline learning
process with a loss function that strikes a balance between accuracy and
information degradation. The loss function also exposes a knob for a
disciplined and controlled asymmetric trade-off between privacy and accuracy.
Experimentation with six real-world DNNs from text processing and image
classification shows that Shredder reduces the mutual information between the
input and the communicated data to the cloud by 74.70% compared to the original
execution while only sacrificing 1.58% loss in accuracy. On average, Shredder
also offers a speedup of 1.79x over Wi-Fi and 2.17x over LTE compared to
cloud-only execution when using an off-the-shelf mobile GPU (Tegra X2) on the
edge.

suspensions and dense mixtures. As in the Marble model, Saurel et al. system is
weakly hyperbolic with the same 4 characteristic waves, while the system
involves 7 partial differential equations. It poses serious theoretical and
practical issues to built simple and accurate flow solver. To overcome related
difficulties the Riemann solver of Linde (2002) is revisited. The method is
first examined in the simplified context of compressible Euler equations.
Physical considerations are introduced in the solver improving robustness and
accuracy of the Linde method. With these modifications the flow solver appears
as accurate as the HLLC solver of Toro et al. (1994). Second the two-phase flow
model is considered. A locally conservative formulation is built and validated
removing issues related to non-conservative terms. However, two extra major
issues appear from numerical experiments: The solution appears not self-similar
and multiple contact waves appear in the dispersed phase. Building HLLC-type or
any other solver appears consequently challenging. The modified Linde (2002)
method is thus examined for the considered flow model. Some basic properties of
the equations are used, such as shock relations of the dispersed phase and jump
conditions across the contact wave. Thanks to these ingredients the new Riemann
solver with internal reconstruction (RSIR), modification of the Linde method,
handles stationary volume fraction discontinuities, presents low dissipation
for transport waves and handles shocks and expansion waves accurately. It is
validated on various test problems showing method's accuracy and versatility
for complex flow models. Its capabilities are illustrated on a difficult
two-phase flow instability problem, unresolved before.

and the Internet from around the world. This material creates a visual record
of the experiences of a significant percentage of humanity and can help
illuminate how we live in the present moment. When properly analyzed, this
video can also help analysts to reconstruct events of interest, including war
crimes, human rights violations, and terrorist acts. Machine learning and
computer vision can play a crucial role in this process. In this technical
report, we describe the Video Event Reconstruction and Analysis (VERA) system.
This new tool brings together a variety of capabilities we have developed over
the past few years (including video synchronization and geolocation to order
unstructured videos lacking metadata over time and space, and sound recognition
algorithms) to enable the reconstruction and analysis of events captured on
video. Among other uses, VERA enables the localization of a shooter from just a
few videos that include the sound of gunshots. To demonstrate the efficacy of
this suite of tools, we present the results of estimating the shooter's
location of the Las Vegas Shooting in 2017 and show that VERA accurately
predicts the shooter's location using only the first few gunshots. We then
point out future directions that can help improve the system and further reduce
unnecessary human labor in the process. All of the components of VERA run
through a web interface that enables human-in-the-loop verification to ensure
accurate estimations. All relevant source code, including the web interface and
machine learning models, is freely available on Github. We hope that
researchers and software developers will be inspired to improve and expand this
system moving forward to better meet the needs of human rights and public
safety.

regression by considering a family of probabilistic ordinal link functions in
the output layer. The link functions are those used for cumulative link models,
which are traditional statistical linear models based on projecting each
pattern into a 1-dimensional space. A set of ordered thresholds splits this
space into the different classes of the problem. In our case, the projections
are estimated by a non-linear deep neural network. To further improve the
results, we combine these ordinal models with a loss function that takes into
account the distance between the categories, based on the weighted Kappa index.
Three different link functions are studied in the experimental study, and the
results are contrasted with statistical analysis. The experiments run over two
different ordinal classification problems and the statistical tests confirm
that these models improve the results of a nominal model and outperform other
robust proposals considered in the literature.

We present ReDO, a new model able to extract objects from images without any

possible to change the textures or colors of the objects without changing the
overall distribution of the dataset. Following this assumption, our approach is
based on an adversarial architecture where the generator is guided by an input
sample: given an image, it extracts the object mask, then redraws a new object
at the same location. The generator is controlled by a discriminator that
ensures that the distribution of generated images is aligned to the original
one. We experiment with this method on different datasets and demonstrate the
good quality of extracted masks.

intuitive assumptions it makes about the behavior of objects both in the
physical world and simulations which mimic physics. Specifically, we propose
the Hypothesis Proposal and Evaluation (HyPE) algorithm, which discovers
objects from raw pixel data, generates hypotheses about the controllability of
observed changes in object state, and learns a hierarchy of skills to test
these hypotheses. We demonstrate that HyPE can dramatically improve the sample
efficiency of policy learning in two different domains: a simulated robotic
block-pushing domain, and a popular benchmark task: Breakout. In these domains,
HyPE learns high-scoring policies an order of magnitude faster than several
state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods.

general polygonal and polyhedral grids, potentially offering great flexibility
to mesh generation algorithms. Differently from classical finite element
methods, where the relation between the geometric properties of the mesh and
the performances of the solver are well known, the characterization of a good
polytopal element is still subject to ongoing research. Current shape
regularity criteria are quite restrictive, and greatly limit the set of valid
meshes. Nevertheless, numerical experiments revealed that PEM solvers can
perform well on meshes that are far outside the strict boundaries imposed by
the current theory, suggesting that the real capabilities of these methods are
much higher. In this work, we propose a benchmark to study the correlation
between general 2D polygonal meshes and PEM solvers. The benchmark aims to
explore the space of 2D polygonal meshes and polygonal quality metrics, in
order to identify weaker shape-regularity criteria under which the considered
methods can reliably work. The proposed tool is quite general, and can be
potentially used to study any PEM solver. Besides discussing the basics of the

its numerous advantages, is supposed to replace the various identification
systems such as barcodes or magnetic stripes in a short time. There are three
devices involved in an RFID protocol: a Reader, a Tag, and a back-end Database.
One of the key factors for the RFID technology is that, in order to be used on
large scale, the price of the Tags has to be cheap: it cannot be expensive
because who is supposed to use it would need a great amount of them,
furthermore, Tags must have very small dimensions. The low-cost nature of such
devices implies the impossibility to use standard cryptographic protocols on
them, furthermore, Ultra-Lightweight Tags even lack the necessary computational
power to generate random numbers. Many experts are trying to build secure
protocols that involve just simple bitwise logical operations for these Tags,
but, unfortunately, each of these protocols turned out to be vulnerable to some
serious attack after short time from publication. The need for a secure RFID
authentication protocol today seems more urgent than ever, because this
technology is already used for security purposes, such as electronic passports.
The challenge to build a secure protocol for Ultra-Lightweight RFID systems is
so hard that in several years no one has been able to build one. In this thesis
we analyze in great detail a recently proposed protocol for Ultra-Lightweight
RFID systems called SLAP, with the aim of finding new vulnerabilities. SLAP has
already been violated (along with a set of similar protocols) by Safkhani and
Bagheri, that have recently published a de-synchronization attack. At the end
of our analysis, we will propose an impersonification attack to the protocol,
along with a fix for our attack and some considerations on the attacks proposed
on this kind of protocols.

pseudo-labels for the examples in the target domain using an external

source and target domains. Note that the two domains have separate batch
normalization layers in both stages. Our framework can be easily incorporated

modules and knowledge distillation are utilized to enhance the accuracy of
shallow classifiers. Based on this architecture, we further propose a threshold

to a rigid rotation of the triangle, and they are analogous to the polar and
azimuthal angle of the vector between the two bodies in the two-body problem.
We show that the rotational symmetry allows us to obtain a closed set of eight
