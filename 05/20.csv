background De Sitter space-time with the spectroscopic study of entanglement of
two atoms. Our set up is in the context of an Open Quantum System (OQS), where
the two atoms, each having two energy levels and represented by Pauli spin
tensor operators projected along any arbitrary direction. The system mimics the
role of a pair of freely falling Unruh De-Witt detectors, which are allowed to
non-adiabatically interact with a conformally coupled massless probe scalar
field which has the role of background thermal bath. The effective dynamics of
this combined system takes into account of the non-adiabatic interaction, which
is commonly known as the Resonant Casimir Polder Interaction (RCPI) with the
thermal bath. Our analysis reveals that the RCPI of two stable entangled atoms
in the quantum vacuum states in OQS depends on the de Sitter space-time
curvature relevant to the temperature of the thermal bath felt by the static
observer. We also find that, in OQS, RCPI produces a new significant
contribution appearing in the effective Hamiltonian of the total system and
thermal bath under consideration. We find that the Lamb Shift is characterized
by a decreasing inverse square power-law behavior, $L^{-2}$, when inter atomic
Euclidean distance, $L$, is much larger than a characteristic length scale,
$k$, which is the inverse surface gravity of the background De Sitter space. If
the background space-time would have been Minkowskian this shift decreases as,
$L^{-1}$, and is independent of temperature. Thus, we establish a connection
between the curvature of the De Sitter space-time with the Lamb Shift
spectroscopy.

the other conserved quantities. The rotor chain is a classical example of such
systems, where energy and angular momentum are conserved. We review here some
recent mathematical results about diffusive transport of energy and other
conserved quantities, in particular for systems where the bulk Hamiltonian
dynamics is perturbed by conservative stochastic terms. The presence of the
stochastic dynamics allows to define the transport coefficients (thermal
conductivity) and in some cases to prove the local equilibrium and the linear
response argument necessary to obtain the diffusive equations governing the
macroscopic evolution of the conserved quantities. Temperature profiles and
other conserved quantities profiles in the non-equilibrium stationary states
can be then understood from the non-stationary diffusive behaviour. We also
review some results and open problems on the two step approach (by weak

the convergence of stochastic gradient type algorithms widely used for
non-convex learning tasks such as training of neural networks. The key insight,
already observed in the works of Mei, Montanari and Nguyen (2018), Chizat and
Bach (2018) as well as Rotskoff and Vanden-Eijnden (2018), is that a certain
class of the finite-dimensional non-convex problems becomes convex when lifted
to infinite-dimensional space of measures. We leverage this observation and
show that the corresponding energy functional defined on the space of
probability measures has a unique minimiser which can be characterised by a
first-order condition using the notion of linear functional derivative. Next,
we study the corresponding gradient flow structure in 2-Wasserstein metric,
which we call Mean-Field Langevin Dynamics (MFLD), and show that the flow of
marginal laws induced by the gradient flow converges to a stationary
distribution, which is exactly the minimiser of the energy functional. We
observe that this convergence is exponential under conditions that are
satisfied for highly regularised learning tasks. Our proof of convergence to
stationary probability measure is novel and it relies on a generalisation of
LaSalle's invariance principle combined with HWI inequality. Importantly, we
assume neither that interaction potential of MFLD is of convolution type nor
that it has any particular symmetric structure. Furthermore, we allow for the
general convex objective function, unlike, most papers in the literature that
focus on quadratic loss. Finally, we show that the error between
finite-dimensional optimisation problem and its infinite-dimensional limit is
of order one over the number of parameters.

thought to form when motile cells use chemotaxis to navigate to chemical
hotspots. However, what governs the dynamics of bacterial aggregations is
unclear. Here, we use a novel experimental platform to create realistic
sub-millimeter scale nutrient pulses with controlled nutrient concentrations.
By combining experiments, mathematical theory and agent-based simulations, we
show that individual \textit{Vibrio ordalii} bacteria begin chemotaxis toward
hotspots of dissolved organic matter (DOM) when the magnitude of the chemical
gradient rises sufficiently far above the sensory noise that is generated by
stochastic encounters with chemoattractant molecules. Each DOM hotspot is
surrounded by a dynamic ring of chemotaxing cells, which congregate in regions
of high DOM concentration before dispersing as DOM diffuses and gradients
become too noisy for cells to respond to. We demonstrate that \textit{V.
ordalii} operates close to the theoretical limits on chemotactic precision.
Numerical simulations of chemotactic bacteria, in which molecule counting noise
is explicitly taken into account, point at a tradeoff between nutrient
acquisition and the cost of chemotactic precision. More generally, our results
illustrate how limits on sensory precision can be used to understand the
location, spatial extent, and lifespan of bacterial behavioral responses in
ecologically relevant environments.

in the NTK regime \citep{jacot2018neural,lee2019wide}, we provide an explicit
and quantitative answer to this problem. Focusing on regression problem, we
prove that, in the NTK regime, for any loss in a general class of functions,
the DNN finds the same \emph{global} minima---the one that is nearest to the
initial value in the parameter space, or equivalently, the one that is closest
to the initial DNN output in the corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert
space. Using these optimization problems, we quantify the impact of initial
output and prove that a random non-zero one increases the generalization error.
We further propose an antisymmetrical initialization (ASI) trick that
eliminates this type of error and accelerates the training. To understand
whether the above results hold in general, we also perform experiments for DNNs
in the non-NTK regime, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical
results and the ASI trick in a qualitative sense. Overall, our work serves as a
baseline for the further investigation of the impact of initialization and loss
function on the generalization of DNNs, which can potentially guide and improve
the training of DNNs in practice.

stored non-zero two-electron integrals, density prescreening, and data
compression methods possesses the linear scaling property with respect to the

total number of non-zero two-electron integrals scales asymptotically linearly
with respect to the number of basis functions for large molecular systems. An
analysis of the Fock matrix calculation with density and density difference
prescreening shows that its linear scaling property arises due to the
asymptotically linear scaling properties of the number of non-zero two-electron
integrals and the linear scaling property of the number of leading matrix
elements of the density matrix. The use of the density and the density
difference prescreening in the Fock matrix calculation consequently improves
this property. The conventional Fock matrix calculation with the stored

Congested Clique model (a distributed message passing model where in each
round, each processor can broadcast an O(log n)-sized message to all other
processors). Our techniques are built to prove bounds for natural input
distributions. So far, all lower bounds for problems in the model relied on
constructing specifically tailored graph families for the specific problem at
hand, resulting in lower bounds for artificially constructed inputs, instead of
natural input distributions.
  One of our results is a lower bound for the directed planted clique problem.
In this problem, an input graph is either a random directed graph (each
directed edge is included with probability 1/2), or a random graph with a
planted clique of size k. That is, k randomly chosen vertices have all of the
edges between them included, and all other edges in the graph appear with
probability 1/2. The goal is to determine whether a clique exists. We show that
when k = n^(1/4 - eps), this problem requires a number of rounds polynomial in
n.
  Additionally, we construct a pseudo-random generator which fools the
Broadcast Congested Clique. This allows us to show that every k round
randomized algorithm in which each processor uses up to n random bits can be
efficiently transformed into an O(k)-round randomized algorithm in which each
processor uses only up to O(k log n) random bits, while maintaining a high
success probability. The pseudo-random generator is simple to describe,
computationally very cheap, and its seed size is optimal up to constant
factors. However, the analysis is quite involved, and is based on the new
technique for proving lower bounds in the model.
  The technique also allows us to prove the first average case lower bound for
the Broadcast Congested Clique, as well as an average-case time hierarchy.

insights into atmospheric dynamics. Observations of the hot Jupiter Kepler-76b
span more than 1,000 days, providing an ideal dataset to search for atmospheric
variability. In this study, we find that Kepler-76b's secondary eclipse, with a
depth of $87 \pm 6$ parts-per-million (ppm), corresponds to an effective
temperature of 2,830$^{+50}_{-30}$ K. Our results also show clear indications
of variability in Kepler-76b's atmospheric emission and reflectivity, with the
phase curve amplitude typically $50.5 \pm 1.3$ ppm but varying between 35 and
70 ppm over tens of days. As is common for hot Jupiters, Kepler-76b's phase
curve shows a discernible offset of $\left( 9 \pm 1.3 \right)^\circ$ eastward
of the sub-stellar point and varying in concert with the amplitude. These
variations may arise from the advance and retreat of thermal structures and
cloud formations in Kepler-76b's atmosphere; the resulting thermal
perturbations may couple with the super-rotation expected to transport
aerosols, giving rise to a feedback loop. Looking forward, the TESS Mission can
provide new insight into planetary atmospheres, with good prospects to observe
both secondary eclipses and phase curves among targets from the mission. TESS's
increased sensitivity in red wavelengths as compared to Kepler means that it
will probably probe different aspects of planetary atmospheres.

this work, we illustrate that for all common word vectors, cosine similarity is
essentially equivalent to the Pearson correlation coefficient, which provides
some justification for its use. We thoroughly characterise cases where Pearson
correlation (and thus cosine similarity) is unfit as similarity measure.
Importantly, we show that Pearson correlation is appropriate for some word
vectors but not others. When it is not appropriate, we illustrate how common
non-parametric rank correlation coefficients can be used instead to
significantly improve performance. We support our analysis with a series of

domains, expert annotations may be prohibitively expensive. An alternative is
to rely on crowdsourcing to reduce costs at the risk of introducing noise. In
this paper we demonstrate that directly modeling instance difficulty can be
used to improve model performance, and to route instances to appropriate
annotators. Our difficulty prediction model combines two learned
representations: a `universal' encoder trained on out-of-domain data, and a
task-specific encoder. Experiments on a complex biomedical information
extraction task using expert and lay annotators show that: (i) simply excluding
from the training data instances predicted to be difficult yields a small boost
in performance; (ii) using difficulty scores to weight instances during
training provides further, consistent gains; (iii) assigning instances
predicted to be difficult to domain experts is an effective strategy for task
routing. Our experiments confirm the expectation that for specialized tasks
expert annotations are higher quality than crowd labels, and hence preferable
to obtain if practical. Moreover, augmenting small amounts of expert data with
a larger set of lay annotations leads to further improvements in model
performance.

utilizes the relatively-weak temporal prior (i.e. seen before, likely to be
seen now), therefore admitting more features into the local map than necessary.
This paper describes an enhancement to co-visibility local map building by
incorporating a strong appearance prior, which leads to a more compact local
map and latency reduction in downstream data association. The appearance prior
collected from the current image influences the local map contents: only the
map features visually similar to the current measurements are potentially
useful for data association. To that end, mapped features are indexed and
queried with Multi-index Hashing (MIH). An online hash table selection
algorithm is developed to further reduce the query overhead of MIH and the
local map size. The proposed appearance-based local map building method is
integrated into a state-of-the-art VO/VSLAM system. When evaluated on two

real-time pose tracking in VO/VSLAM are significantly reduced. Meanwhile, the

theoretical calculations. Here it is shown that recombination of HCO radicals,
formed upon CO hydrogenation, with radicals formed upon C2H2 processing - H2CCH
and H3CCH2 - offers possible reaction pathways to solid-state propanal and
1-propanol formation. This extends the already important role of the CO
hydrogenation chain in the formation of larger COMs (complex organic
molecules). The results are used to compare with ALMA observations. The
resulting 1-propanol:propanal ratio concludes an upper limit of < 0:35-0:55,
which is complemented by computationally-derived activation barriers in
addition to the experimental results.

difficult task. Often, in these protocols, thresholds on set cardinalities are

perform an action only if it has received an acknowledgment from at least half

challenging as it involves two kinds of reasoning: first-order reasoning about
the unbounded state of the protocol, together with reasoning about sets and
cardinalities. In this work, we develop a new methodology for decomposing the
verification task of such protocols into two decidable logics: EPR and BAPA.
Our key insight is that such protocols use thresholds in a restricted way as a
means to obtain certain properties of ""intersection"" between sets. We define a
language for expressing such properties, and present two translations: to EPR
and BAPA. The EPR translation allows verifying the protocol while assuming
these properties, and the BAPA translation allows verifying the correctness of
the properties. We further develop an algorithm for automatically generating
the properties needed for verifying a given protocol, facilitating fully
automated deductive verification. Using this technique we have verified several
challenging protocols, including Byzantine one-step consensus, hybrid reliable

philosophy to detect falls in the absence of their training data, by training
the classifier on only the normal activities (that are available in abundance)

adversarial learning framework, which comprises of a spatio-temporal
autoencoder for reconstructing input video frames and a spatio-temporal
convolution network to discriminate them against original video frames. 3D
convolutions are used to learn spatial and temporal features from the input
video frames. The adversarial learning of the spatio-temporal autoencoder will
enable reconstructing the normal activities of daily living efficiently; thus,
rendering detecting unseen falls plausible within this framework. We tested the
performance of the proposed framework on camera sensing modalities that may
preserve an individual's privacy (fully or partially), such as thermal and
depth camera. Our results on three publicly available datasets show that the
proposed spatio-temporal adversarial framework performed better than other

changes in cell size in cancer reflect tumor status and response to treatments,
such as apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Unfortunately, cell size can only be
obtained by pathologic evaluation of the tumor in the current standard of care.
Previous imaging approaches can be implemented on only animal MRI scanners or
require relatively long acquisition times that are undesirable for clinical
imaging. There is a need to develop cell size imaging for clinics. Experimental
Design: We propose a new method, IMPULSED (Imaging Microstructural Parameters
Using Limited Spectrally Edited Diffusion) that can characterize mean cell
sizes in solid tumors. We report the use of combined sequences with different
gradient waveforms on human MRI and analytical equations that link DWI signals
of real gradient waveforms and specific microstructural parameters such as cell
size. We also describe comprehensive validations using computer simulations,
cell experiments in vitro, and animal experiments in vivo and finally
demonstrate applications in pre-operative breast cancer patients. Results: With
fast acquisitions (~ 7 mins), IMPULSED can provide high-resolution (1.3 mm
in-plane) mapping of mean cell size of human tumors in vivo on
currently-available 3T MRI scanners. All validations suggest IMPULSED provide
accurate and reliable measurements of mean cell size. Conclusion: The proposed
IMPULSED method can assess cell size variations in the tumor of breast cancer
patients, which may have the potential to assess early response to neoadjuvant
therapy.

207-233, 2005) designed for solving the NP-hard problem of computing the
maximal sample variance over interval data, motivated by robust statistics (in
fact, the formulation can be written as a nonconvex quadratic program with a
specific structure). First, we propose a new version of the algorithm improving
its original time bound $O(n^2 2^\omega)$ to $O(n \log n+n\cdot 2^\omega)$,
where $n$ is number of input data and $\omega$ is the clique number in a
certain intersection graph. Then we treat input data as random variables as it
is usual in statistics) and introduce a natural probabilistic data generating
model. We get $2^\omega = O(n^{1/\log\log n})$ and $\omega = O(\log n /
\log\log n)$ on average. This results in average computing time
$O(n^{1+\epsilon})$ for $\epsilon > 0$ arbitrarily small, which may be
considered as ""surprisingly good"" average time complexity for solving an
NP-hard problem. Moreover, we prove the following tail bound on the
distribution of computation time: hard instances, forcing the algorithm to
compute in time $2^{\Omega(n)}$, occur rarely, with probability tending to zero
at the rate $e^{-n\log\log n}$.

interpret these observations we need to calculate the evolution of

enables to track the decay of radioactive isotopes in the interstellar medium.
We show how the evolution of isotopic ratio depends on the star formation
history and efficiency, star-to-gas mass ratio, and galactic outflows. Given
the uncertainties in the observations used to calibrate our model, our
predictions for isotopic ratios at the time of formation of the Sun are
uncertain by a factor of 3.6. At that time, to recover the actual
radioactive-to-stable isotopic ratios predicted by our model, one can multiply
the steady-state solution (see Equation~1) by $2.3^{+3.4}_{-0.7}$. However, in
the cases where the radioactive isotope has a half-life longer than
$\sim$\,200\,Myr, or the target radioactive or stable isotopes have mass-
and/or metallicity-depended production rates, or they originate from different

reached. Does this mean that machines can perform human level commonsense
inference?
  In this paper, we show that commonsense inference still proves difficult for
even state-of-the-art models, by presenting HellaSwag, a new challenge dataset.
Though its questions are trivial for humans (>95% accuracy), state-of-the-art
models struggle (<48%). We achieve this via Adversarial Filtering (AF), a data
collection paradigm wherein a series of discriminators iteratively select an
adversarial set of machine-generated wrong answers. AF proves to be
surprisingly robust. The key insight is to scale up the length and complexity
of the dataset examples towards a critical 'Goldilocks' zone wherein generated
text is ridiculous to humans, yet often misclassified by state-of-the-art
models.
  Our construction of HellaSwag, and its resulting difficulty, sheds light on
the inner workings of deep pretrained models. More broadly, it suggests a new
path forward for NLP research, in which benchmarks co-evolve with the evolving
state-of-the-art in an adversarial way, so as to present ever-harder

consumer and business applications to safety-critical domains. The advent of
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the key catalyst behind such wide-spread
success. However, wide adoption comes with serious concerns about the
robustness of software systems dependent on DNNs for image classification, as
several severe erroneous behaviors have been reported under sensitive and
critical circumstances. We argue that developers need to rigorously test their
software's image classifiers and delay deployment until acceptable. We present
an approach to testing image classifier robustness based on class property
violations.
  We found that many of the reported erroneous cases in popular DNN image
classifiers occur because the trained models confuse one class with another or
show biases towards some classes over others. These bugs usually violate some
class properties of one or more of those classes. Most DNN testing techniques
focus on per-image violations, so fail to detect class-level confusions or
biases.
  We developed a testing technique to automatically detect class-based
confusion and bias errors in DNN-driven image classification software. We
evaluated our implementation, DeepInspect, on several popular image classifiers
with precision up to 100% (avg.~72.6%) for confusion errors, and up to 84.3%
(avg.~66.8%) for bias errors. DeepInspect found hundreds of classification

Although interior equilibria are guaranteed to be NE, no interior equilibrium
can be asymptotically stable in the multi-population RD, resulting, e.g., in
cyclic orbits around a single interior NE. We introduce a new notion of
equilibria of RD, called mutation limits, which is based on the inclusion of a
naturally arising, simple form of mutation, but is invariant under the specific
choice of mutation parameters. We prove the existence of such mutation limits
for a large range of games, and consider a subclass of particular interest,
that of attracting mutation limits. Attracting mutation limits are approximated
by asymptotically stable equilibria of the (mutation-)perturbed RD, and hence,
offer an approximate dynamic solution of the underlying game, especially if the
original dynamic has no asymptotically stable equilibria. In this sense,
mutation stabilises the system in certain cases and makes attracting mutation
limits near-attainable. Furthermore, the relevance of attracting mutation
limits as a game theoretic equilibrium concept is emphasised by a similarity of
(mutation-)perturbed RD to the Q-learning algorithm in the context of
multi-agent reinforcement learning. In contrast to the guaranteed existence of
mutation limits, attracting mutation limits do not exist in all games, raising
the question of their characterization.

steerability is an ability to remotely control the given channel from a

as certifying coherence of the channel in an one-sided-device-independent

steering in a measurement-device-independent way. To do this, we first obtain
Choi matrices from given channels and use canonical method of
measurement-device-independent verification of quantum steering. As a
consequence, exploiting channel-state duality which interconverts steerability
of channels and that of states, channel steering is verified. We further
analyze the effect of imperfect preparation of entangled states used in the
verification protocol, and find that threshold of the undesired noise that we
can tolerate is bounded from below by steering robustness.

description of a given image, and most state-of-the-art models have adopted an
encoder-decoder framework. The framework consists of a convolution neural
network (CNN)-based image encoder that extracts region-based visual features
from the input image, and an recurrent neural network (RNN)-based caption
decoder that generates the output caption words based on the visual features
with the attention mechanism. Despite the success of existing studies, current
methods only model the co-attention that characterizes the inter-modal
interactions while neglecting the self-attention that characterizes the
intra-modal interactions. Inspired by the success of the Transformer model in
machine translation, here we extend it to a Multimodal Transformer (MT) model
for image captioning. Compared to existing image captioning approaches, the MT
model simultaneously captures intra- and inter-modal interactions in a unified
attention block. Due to the in-depth modular composition of such attention
blocks, the MT model can perform complex multimodal reasoning and output
accurate captions. Moreover, to further improve the image captioning
performance, multi-view visual features are seamlessly introduced into the MT
model. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our approach using the
benchmark MSCOCO image captioning dataset and conduct extensive ablation
studies to investigate the reasons behind its effectiveness. The experimental
results show that our method significantly outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art methods. With an ensemble of seven models, our solution ranks
the 1st place on the real-time leaderboard of the MSCOCO image captioning
challenge at the time of the writing of this paper.

NewHope is a promising key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) based on the
Ring-Learning with errors (Ring-LWE) problem. Since the most important factors
to be considered for PQC are security and cost including bandwidth and
time/space complexity, in this paper, by doing exact noise analysis and using
Bose Chaudhuri Hocquenghem (BCH) codes, it is shown that the security and
bandwidth efficiency of NewHope can be substantially improved. In detail, the
decryption failure rate (DFR) of NewHope is recalculated by performing exact
noise analysis, and it is shown that the DFR of NewHope has been too
conservatively calculated. Since the recalculated DFR is much lower than the
required $2^{-128}$, this DFR margin is exploited to improve the security up to
8.5 \% or the bandwidth efficiency up to 5.9 \% without changing the procedure
of NewHope.
  The additive threshold encoding (ATE) used in NewHope is a simple error
correcting code (ECC) robust to side channel attack, but its error-correction
capability is relatively weak compared with other ECCs. Therefore, if a proper
error-correction scheme is applied to NewHope, either security or bandwidth
efficiency or both can be improved. Among various ECCs, BCH code has been
widely studied for its application to cryptosystems due to its advantages such
as no error floor problem. In this paper, the ATE and total noise channel are
regarded as a super channel from an information-theoretic viewpoint. Based on
this super channel analysis, various concatenated coding schemes of ATE and BCH
code for NewHope have been investigated. Through numerical analysis, it is
revealed that the security and bandwidth efficiency of NewHope are
substantially improved by using the proposed error-correction schemes.

cast it as a supervised learning problem, which assumes each interaction as an

relations among instances or items (e.g., the director of a movie is also an
actor of another movie), these methods are insufficient to distill the

investigate the utility of knowledge graph (KG), which breaks down the
independent interaction assumption by linking items with their attributes. We
argue that in such a hybrid structure of KG and user-item graph, high-order
relations --- which connect two items with one or multiple linked attributes
--- are an essential factor for successful recommendation. We propose a new
method named Knowledge Graph Attention Network (KGAT) which explicitly models
the high-order connectivities in KG in an end-to-end fashion. It recursively
propagates the embeddings from a node's neighbors (which can be users, items,
or attributes) to refine the node's embedding, and employs an attention
mechanism to discriminate the importance of the neighbors. Our KGAT is
conceptually advantageous to existing KG-based recommendation methods, which
either exploit high-order relations by extracting paths or implicitly modeling
them with regularization. Empirical results on three public benchmarks show
that KGAT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like Neural FM and
RippleNet. Further studies verify the efficacy of embedding propagation for
high-order relation modeling and the interpretability benefits brought by the

rewards or features for computing them for Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this
paper, we introduce a novel approach that learns values, rather than rewards,
directly from observations. We show that by using values, we can significantly
speed up RL by removing the need to bootstrap action-values, as compared to
sparse-reward specifications.

  Bi-directional Dependencies of Body Parts",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Not all the human body parts have the same~degree of freedom~(DOF) due to the
physiological structure. For example, the limbs may move more flexibly and
freely than the torso does. Most of the existing 3D pose estimation methods,
despite the very promising results achieved, treat the body joints equally and
consequently often lead to larger reconstruction errors on the limbs. In this
paper, we propose a progressive approach that explicitly accounts for the
distinct DOFs among the body parts. We model parts with higher DOFs like the
elbows, as dependent components of the corresponding parts with lower DOFs like
the torso, of which the 3D locations can be more reliably estimated. Meanwhile,
the high-DOF parts may, in turn, impose a constraint on where the low-DOF ones
lie. As a result, parts with different DOFs supervise one another, yielding
physically constrained and plausible pose-estimation results. To further
facilitate the prediction of the high-DOF parts, we introduce a pose-attribute
estimation, where the relative location of a limb joint with respect to the
torso, which has the least DOF of a human body, is explicitly estimated and
further fed to the joint-estimation module. The proposed approach achieves very
promising results, outperforming the state of the art on several benchmarks.

environment typically needs to be estimated. However, designing a state
estimator can sometimes be difficult, especially in environments with
deformable objects. An alternative is to learn an end-to-end policy that maps
directly from high-dimensional sensor inputs to actions. However, if this
policy is trained with reinforcement learning, then without a state estimator,
it is hard to specify a reward function based on high-dimensional observations.
To meet this challenge, we propose a simple indicator reward function for
goal-conditioned reinforcement learning: we only give a positive reward when
the robot's observation exactly matches a target goal observation. We show that
by relabeling the original goal with the achieved goal to obtain positive
rewards (Andrychowicz et al., 2017), we can learn with the indicator reward
function even in continuous state spaces. We propose two methods to further
speed up convergence with indicator rewards: reward balancing and reward
filtering. We show comparable performance between our method and an oracle
which uses the ground-truth state for computing rewards. We show that our

knowledge of atomic physics which are crucial for the precise diagnostic of hot
astrophysical plasma observed with high-resolution X-ray spectrometers.
However, modeling uncertainties remain, both within but especially beyond
Hitomi's spectral window. A major challenge in spectral modeling is the Fe-L
spectrum, which is basically a complex assembly of n>2 to n=2 transitions of Fe
ions in different ionization states, affected by a range of atomic processes
such as collisional excitation, resonant excitation, radiative recombination,
dielectronic recombination, and innershell ionization. In this paper we perform
a large-scale theoretical calculation on each of the processes with the
flexible atomic code (FAC), focusing on ions of Fe XVII to Fe XXIV that form
the main body of the Fe-L complex. The new data are found to be consistent
within 20% with the recent individual R-matrix calculations for the main Fe-L
lines. By further testing the new FAC calculations with the high-quality RGS
data from 15 elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters, we note that the new
model gives systematically better fits than the current SPEX v3.04 code, and
the mean Fe abundance decreases by 12%, while the O/Fe ratio increases by 16%
compared with the results from the current code. Comparing the FAC fit results
to those with the R-matrix calculations, we find a temperature-dependent
discrepancy of up to ~10% on the Fe abundance between the two theoretical
models. Further dedicated tests with both observed spectra and targeted
laboratory measurements are needed to resolve the discrepancies, and
ultimately, to get the atomic data ready for the next high-resolution X-ray
spectroscopy mission.

practically predict the impaired aircraft's flight envelope variation due to
any a-priori unknown failure degree. This paper investigates the predictability
of the number of trim points within the maneuvering flight envelope and its
centroid using both linear and nonlinear least-squares estimation methods. To
do so, various polynomial models and nonlinear models based on hyperbolic
tangent function are developed and compared which incorporate the influencing
factors on the envelope variations as the inputs and estimate the centroid and
the number of trim points of the maneuvering flight envelope at any intended
failure degree. Results indicate that both the polynomial and hyperbolic
tangent function-based models are capable of predicting the impaired fight
envelope variation with good precision. Furthermore, it is shown that the
regression equation of the best polynomial fit enables direct assessment of the
impaired aircraft's flight envelope contraction and displacement sensitivity to
the specific parameters characterizing aircraft failure and flight condition.

currently an on-going effort, several related important transport experiments
are still being pursued in the near term. These will not only serve as
intermediate steps but also show Majorana physics in a more fundamental aspect.
In this perspective, we summarize these key Majorana experiments and the
potential challenges.

and the classifier is established to identify an early DDoS attack by training
simple multiple kernel learning (SMKL) models with two characteristics
including inter-class mean squared difference growth (M-SMKL) and intra-class
variance descent (S-SMKL). The sliding window mechanism is used to coordinate
the S-SMKL and M-SMKL to detect the early DDoS attack. The experimental results

SO mass can be affected by the redshift evolution of the reference density as
well as the physical mass accretion around halos. In this study, we directly
measure the amount of pseudo evolution of the SO masses of cluster-sized halos
by the changes in the reference density from a time series of $N$-body
simulations for the first time. We find that the $52\pm19\%$ difference in the

of cluster-sized halos with a greater amount of pseudo evolution in the SO mass
shows the higher concentration ${\it and}$ greater linear bias parameter that
is a counter-example of the known secondary halo bias due to concentration on

obtained a good match up to 2-3km depth, i.e. enough to image the caprock and
the liquid-dominated reservoir but not deep enough to image the reservoir in
supercritical conditions. To obtain such an image, we had to jointly invert

changes in electric fields did not allow to identify any CSEM signal related to

the weakness of the time-lapse CSEM signal compared the achieved CSEM survey

fast, scalable, and transparent to the underlying lock-free data structures.
Hyaline is based on reference counting - considered impractical for memory
reclamation in the past due to high overheads. Hyaline uses reference counters
only during reclamation, but not while accessing individual objects, which
reduces overheads for object accesses. Since with reference counters, an
arbitrary thread ends up freeing memory, Hyaline's reclamation workload is
(almost) balanced across all threads, unlike most prior reclamation schemes
such as epoch-based reclamation (EBR) or hazard pointers (HP). Hyaline often
yields (excellent) EBR-grade performance with (good) HP-grade memory
efficiency, which is a challenging tradeoff with all existing schemes.
  Hyaline schemes offer: (i) high performance; (ii) good memory efficiency;
(iii) robustness: bounding memory usage even in the presence of stalled
threads, a well-known problem with EBR; (iv) transparency: supporting virtually
unbounded number of threads (or concurrent entities) that can be created and
deleted dynamically, and effortlessly join existent workload; (v) autonomy:
avoiding special OS mechanisms and being non-intrusive to runtime or compiler
environments; (vi) simplicity: enabling easy integration into unmanaged C/C++
code; and (vii) generality: supporting many data structures. All existing
schemes lack one or more properties.
  We have implemented and tested Hyaline on x86(-64), ARM32/64, PowerPC, and
MIPS. The general approach requires LL/SC or double-width CAS, while a

  Good empirical correlations between Red/Infra-Red colours (e.g. (R-I)$_C$)
and effective temperatures have been well established for a long time (e.g.
Veeder 1974, Bessell 1979, Leggett 1992). The more recent (R-I)$_C$
colour-$T_{eff}$ correlation using the data of Mann et al. (2015: hereafter
M15) and Boyajian et al. (2012: hereafter B12) shows that this colour can be
applied as a temperature estimate for large samples of stars. We find that the
mean scatter in $T_{eff}$ relative to the (R-I)$_C$-$T_{eff}$ relationship of
B12 and M15 data is only $\pm 3\sigma =$44.6~K for K dwarfs and $\pm 3\sigma
=$39.4~K for M dwarfs. These figures are small and show that the (R-I)$_C$
colour can be used as a first guess effective temperature estimator for K and M
dwarfs.
  We derive effective temperatures for about 1910 K and M dwarfs using the
calibration of (R-I)$_C$ colour-$T_{eff}$ from B12 and M15 data. We also
compiled $T_{eff}$ and metallicity measurements available in the literature

of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Previously, it has been found that there exists a
correlation among three key parameters concerning the plateau phase, i.e., the
end time of the plateau phase in the GRB rest frame ($T_{a}$), the
corresponding X-ray luminosity at the end time ($L_{X}$) and the isotropic
energy of the prompt GRB ($E_{\gamma,\rm{iso}}$). In this study, we
systematically search through all the \emph{Swift} GRBs with a plateau phase
that occurred between 2005 May and 2018 August. We collect 174 GRBs, with
redshifts available for all of them. For the whole sample, the correlation
between $L_{X}$, $T_{a}$ and $E_{\gamma,\rm{iso}}$ is confirmed, with the best
fit relation being $L_{X}\propto T_{a}^{-1.01}E_{\gamma,\rm{iso}}^{0.84}$. Such
an updated three-parameter correlation still supports that the central leftover
after GRBs is probably a millisecond magnetar. It is interesting to note that
short GRBs with duration less than 2 s in our sample also follow the same
correlation, which hints that the merger production of two neutron stars could
be a high mass magnetar, but not necessarily a black hole. Moreover, GRBs
having an ""internal"" plateau (i.e., with a following decay index being
generally smaller than -3) also obey this correlation. It further strengthens
the idea that the internal plateau is due to the delayed collapse of a high
mass neutron star into a black hole. The updated three-parameter correlation
indicates that GRBs with a plateau phase may act as a standard candle for
cosmology study.

inference of deep neural networks on embedded systems. Our framework provides
data structures and kernels for OpenCL-based parallel forward and backward

representations of parameters using $\ell_1$-based sparse coding while
training, storing them in compressed sparse matrices. Unlike the previous
works, our method does not require a pre-trained model as an input and
therefore can be more versatile for different application environments. Even
though the use of $\ell_1$-based sparse coding for model compression is not
new, we show that it can be far more effective than previously reported when we
use proximal point algorithms and the technique of debiasing. Our experiments
show that our method can produce minimal learning models suitable for small

attributes are widely used in various computer vision tasks. In most of
existing attribute-based research, class-specific attributes (CSA), which are
class-level annotations, are usually adopted due to its low annotation cost for
each class instead of each individual image. However, class-specific attributes
are usually noisy because of annotation errors and diversity of individual
images. Therefore, it is desirable to obtain image-specific attributes (ISA),
which are image-level annotations, from the original class-specific attributes.
In this paper, we propose to learn image-specific attributes by graph-based
attribute propagation. Considering the intrinsic property of hyperbolic
geometry that its distance expands exponentially, hyperbolic neighborhood graph
(HNG) is constructed to characterize the relationship between samples. Based on
HNG, we define neighborhood consistency for each sample to identify
inconsistent samples. Subsequently, inconsistent samples are refined based on
their neighbors in HNG. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the significant superiority of the learned image-specific
attributes over the original class-specific attributes in the zero-shot object

making problems in which the importance and the interaction of criteria may

a level dependent capacity, which is a family of single capacities associated
to each level of evaluation for the considered criteria. We present two
possible formulations of the level dependent capacity where importance and
interaction of criteria are constant inside each one of the subintervals in
which the interval of evaluations for considered criteria is split or vary with
continuity inside the whole interval of evaluations. Since, in general, there
is not only one but many level dependent capacities compatible with the
preference information provided by the Decision Maker, we propose to take into
account all of them by using the Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR) and the
Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA). On one hand, ROR
defines a necessary preference relation (if an alternative a is at least as
good as an alternative b for all compatible level dependent capacities), and a
possible preference relation (if a is at least as good as b for at least one
compatible level dependent capacity). On the other hand, considering a random
sampling of compatible level dependent capacities, SMAA gives the probability
that each alternative reaches a certain ranking position as well as the
probability that an alternative is preferred to another. A real-world decision
problem on rankings of universities is provided to illustrate the proposed
methodology.

the cosmic microwave background temperature maps depend on mitigating potential
biases from the cluster's own thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signal.
Quadratic lensing estimators use a pair of maps to extract the lensing signal:
a large scale gradient map and a small scale lensing map. The SZ bias can be
eliminated by using an SZ-free map in the pair, with the gradient map being
favored for signal-to-noise reasons. However, while this approach eliminates
the bias, the SZ power in small scale lensing map adds extra variance that can
become significant for high mass clusters and low noise surveys. In this work,
we propose projecting out an SZ template to reduce the SZ variance. Any
residual SZ signal after template fitting is uncorrelated with the SZ-free
gradient map, and thus does not bias the mass measurements. For massive
clusters above $4\times 10^{14}$ $M_{\odot}$ observed by the upcoming CMB-S4 or

would increase the cluster lensing signal-to-noise by a factor of 1.4.

southwest extension (M17 SWex) has been carried out with the 45 m Nobeyama
Radio Telescope. Based on the N2H+ (J= 1-0) data obtained, we have identified
46 individual cores whose masses are in the range 43 to 3026 Mo. We examined
the relationship between the physical parameters of the cores and those of
young stellar objects (YSOs) associated with the cores found in the literature.
The comparison of the virial mass and the core mass indicates that most of the
cores can be gravitationally stable if we assume a large external pressure.
Among the 46 cores, we found four massive cores with YSOs. They have large mass
of >~ 1000Mo and line width of >~ 2.5 km s^-1 which are similar to those of
clumps forming high mass stars. However, previous studies have shown that there
is no active massive star formation in this region. Recent measurements of
near-infrared polarization infer that the magnetic field around M17 SWex is
likely to be strong enough to support the cores against self-gravity. We
therefore suggest that the magnetic field may prevent the cores from
collapsing, causing the low-level of massive star formation in M17 SWex.

bandstructures with multiple bands that can be aligned through band engineering
approaches, giving us an opportunity to improve their power factor. In this
work, going beyond the constant relaxation time approximation, we perform an
investigation of the benefits of band alignment in improving the thermoelectric
power factor under different density of states dependent scattering scenarios.
As a test case we consider the Co-based p-type half-Heuslers TiCoSb, NbCoSn and
ZrCoSb. First, using simplified effective mass models combined with Boltzmann
transport, we investigate the conditions of band alignment that are beneficial
to the thermoelectric power factor under three different carrier scattering
scenarios: i) the usual constant relaxation time approximation, ii) intra-band
scattering restricted to the current valley with the scattering rates
proportional to the density of states as dictated by Fermi's Golden Rule, and
iii) both intra- and inter-band scattering across all available valleys, with
the rates determined by the total density of states at the relevant energies.
We demonstrate that the band-alignment outcome differs significantly depending
on the scattering details. Next, using the density functional theory calculated
bandstructures of the half-Heuslers we study their power factor behavior under
strain induced band alignment. We show that strain can improve the power factor
of half-Heuslers, but the outcome heavily depends on the curvatures of the
bands involved, the specifics of the carrier scattering mechanisms, and the
initial band separation. Importantly, we also demonstrate that band alignment
is not always beneficial to the power factor.

graph-based applications; however, training a large-scale GCN remains
challenging. Current SGD-based algorithms suffer from either a high
computational cost that exponentially grows with number of GCN layers, or a
large space requirement for keeping the entire graph and the embedding of each
node in memory. In this paper, we propose Cluster-GCN, a novel GCN algorithm
that is suitable for SGD-based training by exploiting the graph clustering
structure. Cluster-GCN works as the following: at each step, it samples a block
of nodes that associate with a dense subgraph identified by a graph clustering
algorithm, and restricts the neighborhood search within this subgraph. This
simple but effective strategy leads to significantly improved memory and
computational efficiency while being able to achieve comparable test accuracy
with previous algorithms. To test the scalability of our algorithm, we create a
new Amazon2M data with 2 million nodes and 61 million edges which is more than
5 times larger than the previous largest publicly available dataset (Reddit).
For training a 3-layer GCN on this data, Cluster-GCN is faster than the
previous state-of-the-art VR-GCN (1523 seconds vs 1961 seconds) and using much
less memory (2.2GB vs 11.2GB). Furthermore, for training 4 layer GCN on this
data, our algorithm can finish in around 36 minutes while all the existing GCN
training algorithms fail to train due to the out-of-memory issue. Furthermore,
Cluster-GCN allows us to train much deeper GCN without much time and memory
overhead, which leads to improved prediction accuracy---using a 5-layer
Cluster-GCN, we achieve state-of-the-art test F1 score 99.36 on the PPI

power that provides economic stability of the centralized dispatch outcome. In
this case, the market players are entitled to receive the uplift payments that
compensate the economic profit lost when following the centralized dispatch. We
consider a special class of the (possibly non-linear) redundant constraints
that are redundant not only on the feasible set of the centralized dispatch
optimization problem (and, therefore, do not change the centralized dispatch
outcome) but also on the larger set obtained when the power balance constraint
is relaxed. We show that the Lagrangian relaxation of these redundant
constraints may reduce the uplift payments without changing the duality gap.
For any given market price (or a pricing algorithm that sets the producer
revenue as a function of its output volume) in a uninode multi-period power
market with fixed load, we explicitly construct a family of the redundant
constraints that do not change the maximum profit of the producer and result in
zero uplift payment. We show that the introduction and subsequent Lagrangian
relaxation of just one redundant constraint in the centralized dispatch problem
suffice to eliminate the uplift payments for all the producers. In the case of
the convex hull pricing method, the introduction of these redundant constraints
affects neither the duality gap nor the market price for power. The results can
be straightforwardly generalized to a power market with the price-sensitive

widely studied. In this paper, we investigate light bending and gravitational
lensing by compact objects in Brans-Dicke theory in weak gravitational field.
Firstly, we present a general formalism for calculating higher-order
corrections to light bending angle and lensing observables for a static,
spherically symmetric and flat spacetime, in which the metric is given in the
isotropic coordinates. Secondly, we apply the general formalism to Brans-Dicke
theory and get the corresponding light bending angle and lensing observables.
Our results show that, although the sums over the low-order correction terms in
magnifications of the primary and secondary images do not dependent on the
theories of gravity, the sums over correction terms with order higher than
three do. Moreover, we show that the total magnification has a non-vanishing
first-order correction, rather than a vanishing contribution concluded in the
literature. We find that the corrections to lensing observables of BD theory
close to those of GR when the parameter $\omega$ tends to $+\infty$ from
$-\frac32$, while opposition occurs when $\omega$ tends to $-2$ from $-\infty$.

conditions and for long time spans is computationally expensive.
Semi-analytical methods were developed to reduce the computational burden. An
elegant and widely used method of semi-analytically integrating trajectories of
objects subject to atmospheric drag was proposed by King-Hele (KH). However,
the analytical KH contraction method relies on the assumption that the
atmosphere density decays strictly exponentially with altitude. If the actual
density profile does not satisfy the assumption of a fixed scale height, as is
the case for Earth's atmosphere, the KH method introduces potentially large
errors for non-circular orbit configurations.
  In this work, the KH method is extended to account for such errors by using a
newly introduced atmosphere model derivative. By superimposing exponentially
decaying partial atmospheres, the superimposed KH method can be applied
accurately while considering more complex density profiles. The KH method is
further refined by deriving higher order terms during the series expansion. A
variable boundary condition to choose the appropriate eccentricity regime,
based on the series truncation errors, is introduced. The accuracy of the
extended analytical contraction method is shown to be comparable to numerical
Gauss-Legendre quadrature. Propagation using the proposed method compares well
against non-averaged integration of the dynamics, while the computational load
remains very low.

the cocoon. Since TeV emission is likely inverse-Compton emission of electrons

three compact regions in Vela X covering distances from 0.3 pc to 4 pc from the

within the uncertainties for the three regions, with energy densities of the
order $10^{-12}\rm\,erg\,cm^{-3}$. The data indicate the presence of a cutoff
in the electron spectrum at energies of $\sim$100 TeV and a magnetic field
strength of $\sim$$6\,\rm\mu G$. Constraints on the presence of turbulent
magnetic fields are weak. The pressure of TeV electrons and magnetic fields in
the cocoon is dynamically negligible, requiring the presence of another
dominant pressure component. Sub-TeV electrons cannot account completely for
the missing pressure, that may be provided either by relativistic ions or from
mixing of the ejecta with the pulsar wind. The electron spectra are consistent
with expectations from transport scenarios dominated either by advection via
the reverse shock or by diffusion. Constraints on turbulent magnetic fields and
the shape of the electron cutoff can be improved by spectral measurements in
the energy range $\gtrsim 10\rm\,keV$. (abridged)

inflated, thus resulting in biased posterior inference. Here we use stratified
Monte Carlo to considerably reduce the bias induced by data resampling. We also
show empirically that it is possible to obtain reliable inference using a
larger than usual ABC threshold. Finally, we show that with stratified Monte
Carlo we obtain a less variable ABC likelihood. Ultimately we show how our
approach improves the computational efficiency of the ABC samplers. We
construct several ABC samplers employing our methodology, such as rejection and
importance ABC samplers, and ABC-MCMC samplers. We consider simulation studies

physics and are useful in a wide range of application areas. Applications
powered by ExaHyPE can be run on a student's laptop, but are also able to
exploit thousands of processor cores on state-of-the-art supercomputers. The
engine is able to dynamically increase the accuracy of the simulation using
adaptive mesh refinement where required. Due to the robustness and shock
capturing abilities of ExaHyPE's numerical methods, users of the engine can
simulate linear and non-linear hyperbolic PDEs with very high accuracy. Users
can tailor the engine to their particular PDE by specifying evolved quantities,
fluxes, and source terms. A complete simulation code for a new hyperbolic PDE
can often be realised within a few hours - a task that, traditionally, can take
weeks, months, often years for researchers starting from scratch. In this
paper, we showcase ExaHyPE's workflow and capabilities through real-world

during interventions, real-time in-vivo imaging with confocal laser microscopy
has been proposed for differentiation of benign and malignant tissue by manual
expert evaluation. Automatic image classification could improve the surgical
workflow further by providing immediate feedback.
  Methods: We analyze the feasibility of classifying tissue from confocal laser
microscopy in the colon and peritoneum. For this purpose, we adopt both
classical and state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks to directly learn
from the images. As the available dataset is small, we investigate several
transfer learning strategies including partial freezing variants and full
fine-tuning. We address the distinction of different tissue types, as well as
benign and malignant tissue.
  Results: We present a thorough analysis of transfer learning strategies for
colorectal cancer with confocal laser microscopy. In the peritoneum, metastases
are classified with an AUC of 97.1 and in the colon, the primarius is
classified with an AUC of 73.1. In general, transfer learning substantially
improves performance over training from scratch. We find that the optimal
transfer learning strategy differs for models and classification tasks.
  Conclusions: We demonstrate that convolutional neural networks and transfer
learning can be used to identify cancer tissue with confocal laser microscopy.
We show that there is no generally optimal transfer learning strategy and model
as well as task-specific engineering is required. Given the high performance
for the peritoneum, even with a small dataset, application for intraoperative
decision support could be feasible.

Abeta has been widely explored, but its molecular crowding less so. The
synaptic cleft where Abeta locates only holds 60-70 water molecules along its
width. We subjected Abeta40 to 100 different simulations with variable water
cell size. We show that even for this disordered aggregation-prone peptide,
many properties are not cell-size dependent, i.e. a small cell is easily
justified. The radius of gyration, intra-peptide, and peptide-water hydrogen
bonds are well-sampled by short (50 ns) time scales at any cell size. Abeta is
mainly disordered with 0-30% alpha helix but undergoes consistent alpha-beta
transitions up to 14% strand in 5-10% of the simulations regardless of cell
size. The similar prevalence in long and short simulations indicate small
diffusion barriers for structural transitions in contrast to folded globular
proteins, which we suggest is a defining hallmark of intrinsically disordered
proteins. Importantly, the hydrophobic surface increases significantly in small
cells (confidence level 95%, two-tailed t-test), as does the variation in
exposure and backbone conformations (>40% and >27% increased standard
deviations). Whereas hydrophilic exposure dominates hydrophobic exposure in
large cells, this tendency breaks down at low water concentration. We interpret
these findings as a concentration-dependent hydrophobic effect, with the small
water layer unable to keep the protein unexposed, an effect mainly caused by
the layered water-water interactions, not by the peptide dynamics. The exposure
correlates with radius of gyration (R2 0.35-0.50) and could be important in
crowded environments, e.g. the synaptic cleft.

optimization in a regime-switching credit market with physical and
information-induced default contagion. It is assumed that the underlying
regime-switching process has countable states and is unobservable. The
stochastic control problem is formulated under partial observations of asset
prices and sequential default events. By establishing a martingale
representation theorem based on incomplete and phasing out filtration, we
connect the control problem to a quadratic BSDE with jumps, in which the driver
term is non-standard and carries the conditional filter as an
infinite-dimensional parameter. By proposing some truncation techniques and
proving a uniform a priori estimates, we obtain the existence of a solution to
the BSDE using the convergence of solutions associated to some truncated BSDEs.
The verification theorem can be concluded with the aid of our BSDE results,
which in turn yields the uniqueness of the solution to the BSDE.

parameters of an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) during the run. In this paper, we
propose an AOS method based on Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQN), a Deep
Reinforcement Learning method, to control the mutation strategies of
Differential Evolution (DE). The application of DDQN to DE requires two phases.
First, a neural network is trained offline by collecting data about the DE
state and the benefit (reward) of applying each mutation strategy during
multiple runs of DE tackling benchmark functions. We define the DE state as the
combination of 99 different features and we analyze three alternative reward
functions. Second, when DDQN is applied as a parameter controller within DE to
a different test set of benchmark functions, DDQN uses the trained neural
network to predict which mutation strategy should be applied to each parent at
each generation according to the DE state. Benchmark functions for training and
testing are taken from the CEC2005 benchmark with dimensions 10 and 30. We
compare the results of the proposed DE-DDQN algorithm to several baseline DE
algorithms using no online selection, random selection and other AOS methods,
and also to the two winners of the CEC2005 competition. The results show that
DE-DDQN outperforms the non-adaptive methods for all functions in the test set;

be 33.0{\deg} invariant latitude (ILAT), which is comparable to the storms on
25/26 September 1909 (~31.6{\deg} ILAT, minimum Dst of -595 nT), 28/29 August

magnetic storms, we presume that the storm on March 1582 was severe. We also
found that the storm on March 1582 lasted, at least, for three days by
combining European records. The auroral oval stayed at mid-latitude for the
first two days and moved to low-latitude (in East Asia) for the last day. It is
plausible that the storm was caused by a series of ICMEs (interplanetary

weighted dissimilarity measure with the goal of reducing the impact of large
errors among the measured or modeled features. The weights are computed from
the location-dependent standard deviations of the features and stored as part
of the reference fingerprint map (RFM). Spatial filtering and kernel smoothing
of the kinematically collected raw data allow efficiently estimating the
standard deviations during RFM generation. In the positioning stage, the
weights control the contribution of each feature to the dissimilarity measure,
which in turn quantifies the difference between the set of online measured
features and the fingerprints stored in the RFM. Features with little
variability contribute more to the estimated position than features with high
variability. Iterations are necessary because the variability depends on the
location, and the location is initially unknown when estimating the position.
Using real WiFi signal strength data from extended test measurements with
ground truth in an office building, we show that the standard deviations of
these features vary considerably within the region of interest and are neither
simple functions of the signal strength nor of the distances from the
corresponding access points. This is the motivation to include the empirical
standard deviations in the RFM. We then analyze the deviations of the estimated
positions with and without the location-dependent weighting. In the present
example the maximum radial positioning error from ground truth are reduced by
40% comparing to kNN without the weighted dissimilarity measure.

12CO J=1-0, 13CO J=1-0, and C18O J=1-0 data were obtained with the Purple
Mountain Observatory (PMO) 13.7m radio telescope. To trace massive clumps and
extract young stellar objects (YSOs) associated with the M16 HII region, we
used the ATLASGAL and GLIMPSE I catalogs, respectively. From CO data, we
discern a large-scale filament with three velocity components. Because these
three components overlap with each other in both velocity and space, the
filament may be made of three layers. The M16 ionized gas interacts with the
large-scale filament and has reshaped its structure. In the large-scale
filament, we find 51 compact cores from the ATLASGAL catalog, 20 of them being
quiescent. The mean excitation temperature of these cores is 22.5 K, while this
is 22.2 K for the quiescent cores. This high temperature observed for the
quiescent cores suggests that the cores may be heated by M16 and do not
experience internal heating from sources in the cores. Through the relationship
between the mass and radius of these cores, we obtain that 45% of all the cores
are massive enough to potentially form massive stars. Compared with the thermal
motion, the turbulence created by the nonthermal motion is responsible for the
core formation. For the pillars observed towards M16, the H II region may give
rise to the strong turbulence.

of information regarding the strong gravitational field produced by the massive
central object. Such strong gravity regime is often expected to exhibit
deviations from general relativity (GR) which may manifest through the presence
of extra dimensions. Higher dimensions, which serve as the corner stone for
string theory and M-theory can act as promising alternatives to dark matter and
dark energy with interesting implications in inflationary cosmology,
gravitational waves and collider physics. Therefore it is instructive to
investigate the effect of more than four spacetime dimensions on the black hole
continuum spectrum which provide an effective astrophysical probe to the strong
gravity regime. To explore such a scenario, we compute the optical luminosity
emitted by a thin accretion disk around a rotating supermassive black hole
albeit in the presence of extra dimensions. The background metric resembles the
Kerr-Newman spacetime in GR where the tidal charge parameter inherited from
extra dimensions can also assume negative signature. The theoretical luminosity
computed in such a background is contrasted with optical observations of eighty
quasars. The difference between the theoretical and observed luminosity for
these quasars is used to infer the most favoured choice of the rotation
parameter for each quasar and the tidal charge parameter. This has been
achieved by minimizing/maximizing several error estimators, e.g., chi-squared,
Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, index of agreement etc. Intriguingly, all of them
favour a negative value for the tidal charge parameter, a characteristic
signature of extra dimensions. Thus accretion disk does provide a significant
possibility of exploring the existence of extra dimensions through its close
correspondence with the strong gravity regime.

they treat genes individually, disregarding the correlation that exists between
them. On the other hand, some multivariate feature selection methods are
proposed for biomarker discovery. Provided with various biomarker discovery
methods, how to choose the most suitable method for a specific dataset becomes
a problem. In this paper, we present a framework for comparison of potential

are compared by how stable they are and how well they can improve the
classification accuracy. The three methods we have considered are: Significance
Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) which identifies the differentially expressed
genes; minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) based on information theory;
and Characteristic Direction (GeoDE) inspired by a graphical perspective.

$G_n^k$. Those groups may be regarded as analogues of braid groups. Study of
the connection between the groups $G_n^k$ and dynamical systems led to the
discovery of the following fundamental principle: If dynamical systems
describing the motion of $n$ particles possess a nice codimension 1 property
governed by exactly $k$ particles, then these dynamical systems admit a
topological invariant valued in $G_{n}^{k}$. The $G_n^k$ groups have
connections to different algebraic structures. Study of the $G_n^k$ groups led
to, in particular, the construction of invariants, valued in free products of
cyclic groups. All generators of the $G_{n}^{k}$ groups are reflections but
there are many ways to enhance them to get rid of $2$-torsion. Later the first
and the fourth named authors introduced and studied the second family of
groups, denoted by $\Gamma_n^k$, which are closely related to triangulations of
manifolds. The spaces of triangulations of a given manifolds have been widely
studied. Theorem of Pachner says that any two triangulations of a given
manifold can be connected by a sequence of bistellar moves or Pachner moves.
$\Gamma_n^k$ naturally appear when considering the set of triangulations with
the fixed number of points. There are two ways of introducing $\Gamma_n^k$: the
geometrical one, which depends on the metric, and the topological one. The
second one can be thought of as a {\guillemotleft}braid group{\guillemotright}
of the manifold and is an invariant of the topological type of manifold; in a
similar way, one can construct the smooth version. In the present paper we give
a survey of the ideas lying in the foundation of the $G_n^k$ and $\Gamma_n^k$
theories and give an overview of recent results in the study of those groups,
manifolds, dynamical systems, knot and braid theories.

the signal processing aspects. The round turbulent jet has been used as the
test bed since it presents a wide range of degree of difficulty for the LDA
processor (accuracy, dynamic range etc.) across the different radial distances
and downstream development. The data are diagnosed for dynamic range in
residence and interarrival times, and compared to a typical hardware driven
processor. The radial profiles of measured mean streamwise velocity and
variance agree well with previous studies of the round jet. The spatial
turbulent kinetic energy spectra in the fully developed region perfectly match
the expected (and in this region well established) -5/3 power law even for the
largest measured distances from the centerline (where shear and turbulence
intensity are significant).

formation, since it is directly related to the outflow and the jet emanating
from the new-born star and it eventually results in the formation of the
protoplanetary disk. However, the origin of the core rotation and its time
evolution are not well understood. Recent observations reveal that molecular
clouds exhibit a ubiquity of filamentary structures and that star forming cores
are associated with the densest filaments. Since these results suggest that
dense cores form primarily in filaments, the mechanism of core formation from
filament fragmentation should explain the distribution of the angular momentum
of these cores. In this paper we analyze the relation between velocity
fluctuations along the filament close to equilibrium and the angular momentum
of the cores formed along its crest. We first find that an isotropic velocity
fluctuation that follows the three-dimensional Kolmogorov spectrum does not
reproduce the observed angular momentum of molecular cloud cores. We then
identify the need for a large power at small scales and study the effect of
three power spectrum models. We show that the one-dimensional Kolmogorov power
spectrum with a slope -5/3 and an anisotropic model with reasonable parameters
are compatible with the observations. Our results stress the importance of more
detailed and systematic observations of both the velocity structure along
filaments and the angular momentum distribution of molecular cloud cores to
determine the validity of the mechanism of core formation from filamentary
molecular clouds.

parallel loops. Dynamic loop self scheduling (DLS) is used to achieve a
balanced load execution of such applications on high performance computing
(HPC) systems. Large HPC systems are vulnerable to processors or node failures
and perturbations in the availability of resources. Most self-scheduling
approaches do not consider fault-tolerant scheduling or depend on failure or
perturbation detection and react by rescheduling failed tasks. In this work, a
robust dynamic load balancing (rDLB) approach is proposed for the robust self
scheduling of independent tasks. The proposed approach is proactive and does
not depend on failure or perturbation detection. The theoretical analysis of
the proposed approach shows that it is linearly scalable and its cost decrease
quadratically by increasing the system size. rDLB is integrated into an MPI DLS
library to evaluate its performance experimentally with two computationally
intensive scientific applications. Results show that rDLB enables the tolerance
of up to (P minus one) processor failures, where P is the number of processors
executing an application. In the presence of perturbations, rDLB boosted the
robustness of DLS techniques up to 30 times and decreased application execution
time up to 7 times compared to their counterparts without rDLB.

approach to quantitatively describe the dynamic effects of short-term aging and
adaptive response to treatment in proximal mouse tibia and fibula. Our approach
allowed us to perform an end-to-end age prediction based on $\mu$CT images to
determine the dynamic biological process of tissue maturation during a two week

an inherent drawback of such methods is that, the collaborative signal, which
is latent in user-item interactions, is not encoded in the embedding process.
As such, the resultant embeddings may not be sufficient to capture the

  In this work, we propose to integrate the user-item interactions -- more
specifically the bipartite graph structure -- into the embedding process. We
develop a new recommendation framework Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering
(NGCF), which exploits the user-item graph structure by propagating embeddings
on it. This leads to the expressive modeling of high-order connectivity in
user-item graph, effectively injecting the collaborative signal into the

three public benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements over several

scalability to the types of complex problems experienced in the modern world.
Natural systems evolved to solve simpler problems effectively, replicating
these processes for complex problems may suffer from inefficiencies. Several
causal factors can impact scalability; computational complexity, memory
requirements or pure problem intractability. Supporting evidence is provided
using a case study in Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) regards tackling

Facilitating scaling of bio-inspired algorithms necessitates reducing this
decision making. To support this hypothesis, an enhanced Partial-ACO technique
is presented which effectively reduces ant decision making. Reducing the
decision making required by ants by up to 90% results in markedly improved
effectiveness and reduced runtimes for increasingly complex fleet optimisation
problems. Reductions in traversal timings of 40-50% are achieved for problems
with up to 45 vehicles and 437 jobs.

unconditional super-linear lower bounds for the computational complexity of the

to advance a better understanding of the computational complexity of the
problems in P. In particular, they consider All Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) and
other fundamental problems such as checking whether a matrix defines a metric,
verifying the correctness of a matrix product, and detecting a negative
triangle in a graph. Abboud, Grandoni, and Vassilevska Williams study
well-known graph centrality problems such as Radius, Median, etc., and make a
connection between their computational complexity to that of two fundamental
problems, namely APSP and Diameter. They show any algorithm with subcubic
running time for these centrality problems, implies a subcubic algorithm for
either APSP or Diameter. In this paper, we define vertex versions for these
centrality problems and based on that we introduce new complementary problems.
The main open problem of Abboud et al. is whether or not APSP and Diameter are
equivalent under subcubic reduction. One of the results of this paper is APSP
and CoDiameter, which is the complementary version of Diameter, are equivalent.
Moreover, for some of the problems in this set, we show that they are
equivalent to their complementary versions. Considering the slight difference
between a problem and its complementary version, these equivalences give us the
impression that every problem has such a property, and thus APSP and Diameter
are equivalent. This paper is a step forward in showing a subcubic equivalence
between APSP and Diameter, and we hope that the approach introduced in our
paper can be helpful to make this breakthrough happen.

(TIs) protected by inversion symmetry, mostly focusing on the class A of the
Altland-Zirnbauer classification. First, we propose an efficient method for
diagnosing fragile band topology by using the symmetry data in momentum space.
Using this method, we show that among all the possible parity configurations of
inversion-symmetric insulators, at least 17 percent of them have fragile
topology in 2D while fragile TIs are less than 3 percent in 3D. Second, we
study the bulk-boundary correspondence of fragile TIs protected by inversion
symmetry. In particular, we generalize the notion of $d$-dimensional ($d$D)
$k$th-order TIs, which is normally defined for $0<k\le d$, to the cases with
$k>d$, and show that they all have fragile topology. In terms of the Dirac
Hamiltonian, a $d$D $k$th-order TI has $(k-1)$ boundary mass terms. We show
that a minimal fragile TI with the filling anomaly can be considered as the
$d$D $(d+1)$th-order TI, and all the other $d$D $k$th-order TIs with $k>(d+1)$
can be constructed by stacking $d$D $(d+1)$th-order TIs. Although $d$D
$(d+1)$th-order TIs have no in-gap states, the boundary mass terms carry an odd
winding number along the boundary, which induces localized charges on the
boundary at the positions where the boundary mass terms change abruptly. In the
cases with $k>(d+1)$, we show that the net parity of the system with boundaries
can distinguish topological insulators and trivial insulators. Also, by
studying the (nested) Wilson loop spectra, we determine the minimal number of
bands to resolve the Wannier obstruction, which is consistent with the
prediction from our diagnosis method of fragile topology. Finally, we show that
a $(d+1)$D $(k-1)$th-order TI can be obtained by an adiabatic pumping of $d$D
$k$th-order TI, which generalizes the previous study of the 2D 3rd-order TI.

media; and the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch (LLB) equation is solved to evolve the
magnetic system in time. The reduction of the magnetization is determined over
a range of peak system temperatures and for a number of anisotropy values. The
results show that the HAMR process is not simply magnetization reversal over a
thermally reduced energy barrier. To achieve full magnetization reversal (for
all anisotropies investigated) an applied field strength of at least 6kOe is
required and the peak system temperature must reach at least the Curie point
(Tc). When heated to Tc the magnetization associated with each grain is
destroyed, which invokes the non-precessional linear reversal mode. Reversing
the magnetization through this linear reversal mode is favourable, as the
reversal time is two orders of magnitude smaller than that associated with
precession. Under these conditions, as the temperature decreases to ambient,
the magnetization recovers in the direction of the applied field, completing
the reversal process. Also the model produces results which are consistent with
the concept of thermal writability; when heating the media to Tc, the smaller
grains require a larger field strength to reverse the magnetization.

particles such as fermions or bosons in the form of Bose-Einstein condensates.
In that case, they generically have a ""core-halo"" structure with a quantum core
that depends on the type of particle considered and a halo that is relatively
independent of the dark matter particle and that is similar to the NFW profile
of cold dark matter. We model the halo by an isothermal gas with an effective
temperature $T$. We then derive the core mass -- halo mass relation $M_c(M_v)$
of dark matter halos from an effective thermodynamical model by extremizing the
free energy $F(M_c)$ with respect to the core mass $M_c$. We obtain a general
relation that is equivalent to the ""velocity dispersion tracing"" relation
according to which the velocity dispersion in the core $v_c^2\sim GM_c/R_c$ is
of the same order as the velocity dispersion in the halo $v_v^2\sim GM_v/r_v$.
We provide therefore a justification of this relation from thermodynamical
arguments. In the case of fermions, we obtain a relation $M_c\propto M_v^{1/2}$
that agrees with the relation found numerically by Ruffini {\it et al.}. In the
case of noninteracting bosons, we obtain a relation $M_c\propto M_v^{1/3}$ that
agrees with the relation found numerically by Schive {\it et al.}. In the case
of bosons with a repulsive self-interaction in the Thomas-Fermi limit, we
predict a relation $M_c\propto M_v^{2/3}$ that still has to be confirmed
numerically. We also obtain a general approximate core mass -- halo mass
relation that is valid for bosons with arbitrary repulsive or attractive
self-interaction. For an attractive self-interaction, we determine the maximum

low-dimensional space with discriminative information from one single view.
Even though most of them can achieve satisfactory performance in some certain
situations, they fail to fully consider the information from multiple views
which are highly relevant but sometimes look different from each other.
Besides, correlations between features from multiple views always vary greatly,
which challenges multi-view subspace learning. Therefore, how to learn an
appropriate subspace which can maintain valuable information from multi-view
features is of vital importance but challenging. To tackle this problem, this
paper proposes a novel multi-view dimension reduction method named Multi-view
Locality Low-rank Embedding for Dimension Reduction (MvL2E). MvL2E makes full
use of correlations between multi-view features by adopting low-rank
representations. Meanwhile, it aims to maintain the correlations and construct
a suitable manifold space to capture the low-dimensional embedding for
multi-view features. A centroid based scheme is designed to force multiple
views to learn from each other. And an iterative alternating strategy is
developed to obtain the optimal solution of MvL2E. The proposed method is
evaluated on 5 benchmark datasets. Comprehensive experiments show that our
proposed MvL2E can achieve comparable performance with previous approaches

$\nu = q\mu$, where $q$ is a sum-of-squares polynomial and $\mu$ is a given

a converging hierarchy of upper bounds $f^{(r)}$ for $f_{\min,K}$. When $K$ is

electron paths in laser-induced ionization of atoms, leading to interference
patterns in the final momentum distribution. For a quantitative description of
holography beyond the electric dipole approximation and in the presence of the
Coulomb potential, we develop a semiclassical model in which the initial
conditions of outgoing electrons are set according to the beyond-dipole
strong-field approximation for the ionization step. The phases associated with
trajectories are evaluated following the prescription for semiclassical
propagators. The validity of the method is confirmed by comparison to the
numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation in two spatial
dimensions. The semiclassical model reproduces correctly the backward and
forward shifts of the photoelectron momenta along the laser propagation axis
that arise from beyond-dipole dynamics. The position of the central holographic
interference fringe can be estimated already from a simplified Coulomb-free
interference model that provides closed-form expressions for the beyond-dipole
shifts. In three dimensions, Coulomb focusing causes a breakdown of the
semiclassical model for final momenta with directions close to the polarization
axis. We implement a beyond-dipole regularization procedure based on the
concept of glory scattering, which was recently used to describe Coulomb
focusing in the dipole approximation. While the position of the central maximum
and higher-order fringes can already be obtained approximately by simpler
semiclassical modeling, this glory model is able to predict the shape of the
distribution in the close vicinity of the central maximum. The violation of the
dipole approximation in holography should be observable with mid-infrared
fields, for which the forward/backward shifts can be comparable with the fringe

for solving systems of algebraic equations, where the matrix comes from the

on matrices obtained from finite difference or finite element approximation of
second order elliptic problems in $\mathbb R^d$, $d=1,2,3$. The proposed
methods are based on the best uniform rational approximation (BURA)
$r_{\alpha,k}(t)$ of $t^{\alpha}$ on $[0,1]$. Here $r_{\alpha,k}$ is a rational
function of $t$ involving numerator and denominator polynomials of degree at
most $k$. We show that the proposed method is exponentially convergent with
respect to $k$ and has some attractive properties. First, it reduces the
solution of the nonlocal system to solution of $k$ systems with matrix $(A +c_j
I)$ and $c_j>0$, $j=1,2,\ldots,k$. Thus, good computational complexity can be
achieved if fast solvers are available for such systems. Second, the original
problem and its rational approximation in the finite difference case are
positivity preserving. In the finite element case, positivity preserving
results when mass lumping is employed under some mild conditions on the mesh.
Further, we prove that in the mass lumping case, the scheme still leads to the
expected rate of convergence, at times assuming additional regularity on the
right hand side. Finally, we present comprehensive numerical experiments on a

Previous work proposed to assign binary latent masks to input positions and to
promote short selections via sparsity-inducing penalties such as L0
regularisation. We propose a latent model that mixes discrete and continuous
behaviour allowing at the same time for binary selections and gradient-based
training without REINFORCE. In our formulation, we can tractably compute the
expected value of penalties such as L0, which allows us to directly optimise
the model towards a pre-specified text selection rate. We show that our
approach is competitive with previous work on rationale extraction, and explore
further uses in attention mechanisms.

stability and optimal convergence rate are established for a large class of
flux parameters. Depending on the flux choices and if the polynomial degree $k$
is even or odd, in this paper, we prove $2k$ or $(2k-1)$-th order
superconvergence rate for cell averages and numerical flux of the function, as
well as $(2k-1)$ or $(2k-2)$-th order for numerical flux of the derivative. In
addition, we prove superconvergence of $(k+2)$ or $(k+3)$-th order of the DG
solution towards a special projection. At a class of special points, the
function values and the first and second order derivatives of the DG solution
are superconvergent with order $k+2, k+1, k$, respectively. The proof relies on
the correction function techniques initiated in [8], and applied to [6] for
direct DG (DDG) methods for diffusion problems. Compared with [6],
Schr\""odinger equation poses unique challenges for superconvergence proof
because of the lack of the dissipation mechanism from the equation. One major
highlight of our proof is that we introduce specially chosen test functions in
the error equation and show the superconvergence of the second derivative and
jump across the cell interfaces of the difference between numerical solution
and projected exact solution. This technique was originally proposed in [12]
and is essential to elevate the convergence order for our analysis. Finally, by
negative norm estimates, we apply the post-processing technique and show that

randomly distributed resonant impurities on the power factor. Using the
Chebyshev Polynomial Green's Function method, we compute the electron transport
properties for very large systems (10 million atoms) with an exact treatment of
disorder. The introduction of resonant defects can lead to a large enhancement
of the power factor together with a sign inversion in the Seebeck coefficient.
This boost depends crucially on the position of the resonant peak, and on the
interplay between elastic impurity scattering and inelastic processes. Strong
electron-phonon or electron-electron scattering are found detrimental. Finally,
the robustness of our results is examined in the case of anisotropic orbitals
and two-dimensional confinement. Our findings are promising for the prospect of

slice is up to 26 ms and 520 ms for one 3D volume of 20 coronal slices.
Principal component analysis and a phase-sensitive resorting of slices is
performed to restore temporal consistency of the volumes. Motion is estimated
from these volumes using hyper-elastic registration. The approach is validated
with the help of a dynamic thorax phantom as well as with eleven healthy

an accurate motion estimation. Volunteer validation proves that the approach is
also valid for different respiratory amplitudes including highly irregular

An extended

account for the extended spin-up, magnitude and post-glitch relaxation
characteristics of this glitch. We evaluate the extended spin-up followed by
the familiar spin-down as due to the creep response to the initial induced
inward motion of some vortex lines pinned to broken crustal plates moving
inward towards the rotation axis, together with the common and familiar
post-glitch creep response to the sudden outward motion of vortices unpinned at
the glitch. Our analysis confirms that the number of unpinned vortices
participating in glitches are similar in all Crab glitches, and within an order
of magnitude in all glitches from all pulsars. This typical number of unpinned
vortices is related to the broken plate size in quakes as triggers for vortex
unpinning avalanches. The physical determinant of this universal broken plate
size is in turn the critical strain angle in the neutron star crust. Occurrence
of this largest Crab glitch after a relatively long inactive period is
consistent with accumulation of the pinned vorticity to be tapped.

at the DC, excitation frequency, and its multiples (harmonics). In this paper,
we present results of such measurements, accomplished using a one-port
nonlinear vector network analyzer (NVNA), which show distinct resonances at
fractional frequencies of the free layer (FL) FMR mode. Identification of these

magnetodipolar feedback between magnetic layers adjacent to an MgO barrier.
Additionally, we determined that the simulated harmonic response is strongly
enhanced by the mutual ST effect between these layers. Finally, we demonstrate
that the read sensors' nonlinear magnetization dynamics and, by extension,
their harmonic response are highly sensitive to various magnetic and ST
parameters. Thus, this study shows that using NVNA measurements in conjunction

surgical success of cementless 15 hip arthroplasty. During the insertion, a
compromise must be found for the number and energy of 16 impacts that should be
sufficiently large to obtain an adapted primary stability of the FS and not too
high 17 to decrease fracture risk. The aim of this study is to determine
whether a hammer instrumented with a 18 force sensor can be used to monitor the
insertion of FS. 19 Cementless FS of different sizes were impacted in four
artificial femurs with an instrumented hammer, 20 leading to 72 configurations.
The impact number when the surgeon empirically felt that the FS was fully 21
inserted was noted Nsurg. The insertion depth E was assessed using video motion
tracking and the impact 22 number Nvid corresponding to the end of the
insertion was estimated. For each impact, two indicators 23 noted I and D were
determined based on the analysis of the variation of the force as a function of
time. 24 The pull-out force F was significantly correlated with the indicator I
(R${}^2$ =0.67). The variation of D was 25 analyzed using a threshold to
determine an impact number Nd, which is shown to be closely related to 26 Nsurg
and Nvid, with an average difference of around 0.2. This approach allows to
determine i) the moment 27 when the surgeon should stop the impaction procedure
in order to obtain an optimal insertion of the FS 28 and ii) the FS implant
primary stability. This study paves the way towards the development of a
decision 29 support system to assist the surgeon in hip arthroplasty.

have been suggested to assess dental implant primary stability. PurposeThe
purpose of this study was to compare the results obtained using these two
techniques applied to the same dental implants inserted in various bone
phantoms. Materials and MethodsDifferent values of trabecular bone density and
cortical thickness were considered to assess the effect of bone quality on the
respective indicators (UI and ISQ). The effect of the implant insertion depth
and of the final drill diameter was also investigated. ResultsISQ values
increase and UI values decrease as a function of trabecular density, cortical
thickness and the screwing of the implant. When the implant diameter varies,
the UI values are significantly different for all final drill diameters (except
for two), while the ISQ values are similar for all final drill diameters lower
than 3.2 mm and higher than 3.3 mm. The error on the estimation of parameters
with the QUS device is between 4 and 8 times lower compared to that made with
the RFA technique.ConclusionsThe results show that ultrasound technique
provides a better estimation of different parameters related to the implant
stability compared to the RFA technique.

that our model is competitive to both classical and Graph Neural Network (GNN)

  and its Identification with Shadow Images","21 pages, 16 figures, references added. Version published in Physical
  Review D","Phys. Rev. D 100, 044012 (2019)","10.1103/PhysRevD.100.044012",,"physics.gen-ph astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we present a new black hole solution surrounded by dark matter
halo in the galactic center using the mass model of M87 and that coming from
the Universal Rotation Curve (URC) dark matter profile representing family of
spiral galaxies. In both cases the DM halo density is cored with a size $r_0$
and a central density $\rho_0$: $\rho(r)= \rho_0/(1+r/r_0)(1+(r/r_0)^2)$. Since
$r_0\rho_0=120 M_{\odot}$/pc$^2$ [Donato et al., MNRAS, 397, 1169, 2009], then
by varying the central density one can reproduce the DM profile in any spiral.
Using the Newman-Jains method we extend our solution to obtain a rotating black
hole surrounded by dark matter halo. We find that, the apparent shape of the
shadow beside the black hole spin $a$, it also depends on the central density
of the surrounded dark matter $\rho_0$. As a specific example we consider the
galaxy M87, with a central density $\rho_0=6.9\,\times 10^{6}
M_{\odot}$/kpc$^3$ and a core radius $r_0=91.2$ kpc. In the case of M87, our
analyses show that the effect of dark matter on the size of the black hole
shadow is almost negligible compared to the shadow size of the Kerr vacuum
solution hence the angular diameter $ 42$ $\mu$as remains almost unaltered when
the dark matter is considered. For a small totally dark matter dominated spiral
such as UGC 7232, we find similar effect of dark matter on the shadow images
compared to the M87. However, in specific conditions having a core radius
comparable to the black hole mass and dark matter with very high density, we
show that the shadow images decreases compared to the Kerr vacuum black hole.
The effect of dark matter on the apparent shadow shape can shed some light in
future observations as an indirect way to detect dark matter using the shadow
images.

  Egypt",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Field canals improvement projects (FCIPs) are one of the ambitious projects
constructed to save fresh water. To finance this project, Conceptual cost
models are important to accurately predict preliminary costs at the early
stages of the project. The first step is to develop a conceptual cost model to
identify key cost drivers affecting the project. Therefore, input variables
selection remains an important part of model development, as the poor variables
selection can decrease model precision. The study discovered the most important
drivers of FCIPs based on a qualitative approach and a quantitative approach.
Subsequently, the study has developed a parametric cost model based on machine
learning methods such as regression methods, artificial neural networks, fuzzy
model and case-based reasoning.

lives by recommending unexplored POIs to users and have drawn extensive
attention from both academia and industry. Despite their value, however, they
still suffer from the challenges of capturing complicated user preferences and
fine-grained user-POI relationship for spatio-temporal sensitive POI
recommendation. Existing recommendation algorithms, including both shallow and
deep approaches, usually embed the visiting records of a user into a single
latent vector to model user preferences: this has limited power of
representation and interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel
topic-enhanced memory network (TEMN), a deep architecture to integrate the
topic model and memory network capitalising on the strengths of both the global
structure of latent patterns and local neighbourhood-based features in a
nonlinear fashion. We further incorporate a geographical module to exploit
user-specific spatial preference and POI-specific spatial influence to enhance
recommendations. The proposed unified hybrid model is widely applicable to
various POI recommendation scenarios. Extensive experiments on real-world
WeChat datasets demonstrate its effectiveness (improvement ratio of 3.25% and
29.95% for context-aware and sequential recommendation, respectively). Also,
qualitative analysis of the attention weights and topic modeling provides
insight into the model's recommendation process and results.

  Factorization","Accepted for publication at UAI 2019",,,,"cs.IR cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Count data are often used in recommender systems: they are widespread (song
play counts, product purchases, clicks on web pages) and can reveal user
preference without any explicit rating from the user. Such data are known to be
sparse, over-dispersed and bursty, which makes their direct use in recommender
systems challenging, often leading to pre-processing steps such as
binarization. The aim of this paper is to build recommender systems from these
raw data, by means of the recently proposed compound Poisson Factorization
(cPF). The paper contributions are three-fold: we present a unified framework
for discrete data (dcPF), leading to an adaptive and scalable algorithm; we
show that our framework achieves a trade-off between Poisson Factorization (PF)
applied to raw and binarized data; we study four specific instances that are
relevant to recommendation and exhibit new links with combinatorics.
Experiments with three different datasets show that dcPF is able to effectively
adjust to over-dispersion, leading to better recommendation scores when
compared with PF on either raw or binarized data.

that are required to sort all elements of a permutation. A block-interchange
operation exchanges two blocks of a permutation which are not necessarily
adjacent and in a prefix block-interchange, one block is always the prefix of
that permutation. In this paper, we focus on applying prefix block-interchanges
on binary and ternary strings. We present upper bounds to group and sort a
given binary/ternary string. We also provide upper bounds for a different
version of the block-interchange operation which we refer to as the `restricted
prefix block-interchange'. We observe that our obtained upper bound for
restricted prefix block-interchange operations on binary strings is better than
that of other genome rearrangement operations to group fully normalized binary
strings. Consequently, we provide a linear-time algorithm to solve the problem
of grouping binary normalized strings by restricted prefix block-interchanges.
We also provide a polynomial time algorithm to group normalized ternary strings
by prefix block-interchange operations. Finally, we provide a classification
for ternary strings based on the required number of prefix block-interchange
operations.

Clifford algebra $C\ell(8)$ are shown to contain three generations of Standard
Model fermion states, with full Lorentzian, right and left chiral, weak
isospin, spin, and electrocolor degrees of freedom. The left adjoint action
algebra of $C\ell(8)\cong\mathbb{C}(16)$ on its minimal left ideals contains
the Dirac algebra, weak isopin and spin transformations. The right adjoint
action algebra on the other hand encodes the electrocolor symmetries. These
results extend earlier work in the literature that shows that the eight minimal
left ideals of $\mathbb{C}(8)\cong C\ell(6)$ contain the quark and lepton
states of one generation of fixed spin. Including spin degrees of freedom
extends $C\ell(6)$ to $C\ell(8)$, which unlike $C\ell(6)$ admits a triality
automorphism. It is this triality that underlies the extension from a single
generation of fermions to exactly three generations.
