oxide-based electronic devices. However, in addition to low-field mobility,
high-field transport properties such as the saturation velocity of carriers
play a major role in determining device performance. We report on the
experimental measurement of electron saturation velocity in La-doped BaSnO_{3}
thin films for a range of doping densities. Predicted saturation velocities
based on a simple LO-phonon emission model using an effective LO phonon energy
of 120 meV show good agreement with measurements of velocity saturation in
La-doped BaSnO_{3} films.. Density-dependent saturation velocity in the range
of 1.6x10^{7} cm/s reducing to 2x10^{6} cm/s is predicted for {\delta}-doped
BaSnO3 channels with carrier densities ranging from 10^{13} cm^{-2} to
2x10^{14} cm^{-2} respectively. These results are expected to aid the informed
design of BaSnO3 as the active material for high-charge density electronic

accounting for their limited connectivity. One way of overcoming limited
connectivity is to insert swaps in the circuit so that logical operations can
be performed on physically adjacent qubits, which we refer to as solving the

quantum circuits defined by a hypergraph wherein each hyperedge corresponds to
a potential gate. Our main result is that any unordered set of $k$-qubit gates
on distinct $k$-qubit subsets of $n$ logical qubits can be ordered and
parallelized in $O(n^{k-1})$ depth using a linear arrangement of $n$ physical
qubits; the construction is completely general and achieves optimal scaling in
the case where gates acting on all $\binom{n}{k}$ sets of $k$ qubits are
desired. We highlight two classes of problems for which our method is
particularly useful. First, it applies to sets of mutually commuting gates, as
in the (diagonal) phase separators of Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz
(Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) circuits. For example, a single
level of a QAOA circuit for Maximum Cut can be implemented in linear depth, and
a single level for $3$-SAT in quadratic depth. Second, it applies to sets of
gates that do not commute but for which compilation efficiency is the dominant
criterion in their ordering. In particular, it can be adapted to Trotterized
time-evolution of fermionic Hamiltonians under the Jordan-Wigner
transformation, and also to non-standard mixers in QAOA. Using our method, a
single Trotter step of the electronic structure Hamiltonian in an arbitrary
basis of $n$ orbitals can be done in $O(n^3)$ depth while a Trotter step of the
unitary coupled cluster singles and doubles method can be implemented in $O(n^2
\eta)$ depth, where $\eta$ is the number of electrons.

for data analysis of Stage IV galaxy surveys. A selection of competing
non-linear models must be made based on validation studies. We provide a
comprehensive set of forecasts of two different models for the halo redshift
space power spectrum, namely the commonly applied TNS model and an effective
field theory of large scale structure (EFTofLSS) inspired model. Using
simulation data and a least-$\chi^2$ analysis, we determine ranges of validity
for the models. We then conduct an exploratory Fisher analysis using the full
anisotropic power spectrum to investigate parameter degeneracies. We proceed to
perform an MCMC analysis utilising the monopole, quadrupole, and hexadecapole
spectra, with a restricted range of scales for the latter in order to avoid
biasing our growth rate, $f$, constraint. We find that the TNS model with a
Lorentzian damping and standard Eulerian perturbative modelling outperforms
other variants of the TNS model. Our MCMC analysis finds that the
EFTofLSS-based model may provide tighter marginalised constraints on $f$ at
$z=0.5$ and $z=1$ than the TNS model, despite having additional nuisance
parameters. However this depends on the range of scales used as well as the
fiducial values and priors on the EFT nuisance parameters. Finally, we extend
previous work to provide a consistent comparison between the Fisher matrix and
MCMC forecasts using the multipole expansion formalism, and find good agreement
between them.

the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect strongly rely on the mean pressure profile

cosmological constraints obtained from the analyses of the CMB primary
anisotropies and those from cluster abundance in SZ surveys. This discrepancy
may be explained by a wrong estimate of the hydrostatic bias parameter that
links the hydrostatic mass to the true mass of galaxy clusters. However, a
variation of both the amplitude and the shape of the mean pressure profile
could also explain part of this tension. We analyze the effects of a
modification of this profile on the constraints of the $\sigma_8$ and
$\Omega_m$ parameters through the analysis of the SZ power spectrum measured by
the $Planck$ collaboration. We choose two mean pressure profiles that are
respectively lower and higher than the one obtained from the observation of
nearby clusters by $Planck$. The selection of the parameters of these two
profiles is based on the current estimates of the pressure and gas mass
fraction profile distributions at low redshift. The cosmological parameters
found for these two profiles are significantly different from the ones obtained
with the $Planck$ pressure profile. We conclude that a ${\sim}15\%$ decrease of
the amplitude of the mean normalized pressure profile would alleviate the
tension observed between the constraints of $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ from the

range, radio systems---such as IoT sensor networks, Wi-Fi and cellular
networks---benefit from the ability to direct their signals, to ensure that
more of the transmitted power reaches the receiver. Many modern systems
beamform with antenna arrays for this purpose. However, a radio's ability to
direct its signal is fundamentally limited by its size. Unfortunately practical
challenges limit the size of modern radios, and consequently, their ability to
beamform. In many settings, radios on devices must be small and inexpensive;
today, these settings are unable to benefit from high-precision beamforming.
  To address this problem, we introduce RFocus, which moves beamforming
functions from the radio endpoints to the environment. RFocus includes a
two-dimensional surface with a rectangular array of simple elements, each of
which functions as an RF switch. Each element either lets the signal through or
reflects it. The surface does not emit any power of its own. The state of the
elements is set by a software controller to maximize the signal strength at a
receiver, with a novel optimization algorithm that uses signal strength
measurements from the receiver. The RFocus surface can be manufactured as an
inexpensive thin wallpaper, requiring no wiring. This solution requires only a
method to communicate received signal strengths periodically to the RFocus
controller. Our prototype implementation improves the median signal strength by
10.5x, and the median channel capacity by 2.1x.

fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), security incidents and events on

detect and mitigate many of such security threats against IoT networks.
Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) have been widely used for classifying
intrusion attacks in IoT networks. In this paper, we consider a variant of the
FNN known as the Self-normalizing Neural Network (SNN) and compare its
performance with the FNN for classifying intrusion attacks in an IoT network.
Our analysis is performed using the BoT-IoT dataset from the Cyber Range Lab of

outperforms the SNN for intrusion detection in IoT networks based on multiple
performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall as well as
multi-classification metrics such as Cohen's Kappa score. However, when tested

immigration studied in Karlin and McGregor (1967), in turn related to the
celebrated Ewens sampling formula. A biological basis for the scheme is
provided in terms of a population of individuals grouped into families, that
evolves according to a sequence of births, deaths and immigrations. We
investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the chain and show that, as opposed to
the birth-and-death process with immigration, this construction maintains in
the temporal limit the mutual dependence among the multiplicities. When the
death rate exceeds the birth rate, the system is shown to have reversible
distribution identified as a mixture of Pitman sampling formulae, with negative
binomial mixing distribution on the population size. The population therefore
converges to a stationary random configuration, characterised by a finite
number of families and individuals.

the most relevant one. The absence of it affects the Fermi energy and
consequently the thermodynamic properties of the system. In the absence of
magnetic fields, we verify that the rotational symmetry in the lateral
confinement is preserved in the electronic states of the system and its

broken. In the presence of a magnetic field, however, the energies of the
electronic states in a quantum dot with a curvature are greater than those
obtained for a quantum dot in a flat space, and the profile of degeneracy
changes when the field is varied. We show that the curvature of the surface
modifies the number of subbands occupied in the Fermi energy. In the study of
both magnetization and persistent currents, we observe that Aharonov-Bohm-type

nodes spend computing resources and earn rewards in return for spending these
resources. This incentive system has caused power to be significantly biased
towards a few nodes, called mining pools. In fact, poor decentralization
appears not only in PoW-based coins but also in coins adopting other mechanisms
such as proof-of-stake (PoS) and delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS). In this
paper, we target this centralization issue. To this end, we first define (m,
\varepsilon, \delta)-decentralization as a state that satisfies 1) there are at
least m participants running a node and 2) the ratio between the total resource
power of nodes run by the richest and \delta-th percentile participants is less
than or equal to 1+\varepsilon. To see if it is possible to achieve good
decentralization, we introduce sufficient conditions for the incentive system
of a blockchain to reach (m, \varepsilon, \delta)-decentralization. When
satisfying the conditions, a blockchain system can reach full decentralization
with probability 1. However, to achieve this, the blockchain system should be
able to assign a positive Sybil cost, where the Sybil cost is defined as the
difference between the cost for one participant running multiple nodes and the
total cost for multiple participants each running one node. On the other hand,
we prove that when there is no Sybil cost, the probability of reaching (m,
\varepsilon, \delta)-decentralization is upper bounded by a value close to 0,
considering a large rich-poor gap. To determine the conditions that each system
cannot satisfy, we also analyze protocols of all PoW, PoS, and DPoS coins in
the top 100 coins according to our conditions. Finally, we conduct data

interface and the liquid/gas interface in partially saturated pores are the
main contributors for the disruption of the hydrogen bond network of glycerol.
Despite the reduction of hydrogen bonds between glycerol molecules caused by
the presence of the solid, glycerol molecules near the solid surface can
establish hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ that
significantly slow-down the dynamics of the confined fluid compared to the bulk
liquid. On the other hand, the disruption of the hydrogen bond network caused
by the liquid/gas interface in unsaturated pores reduces significantly the
number of hydrogen bonds between glycerol molecules and results in a faster
dynamics than in the bulk liquid. Therefore, we suggest that the discrepancies
reported in the literature are a consequence of measurements carried out under
different pore saturation conditions.

brittle to adversarial examples, which are examples created to look
incontrovertibly belonging to a certain class to a human eye but contain subtle
features that fool the classifier into misclassifying them into the wrong

medical-related tasks. Yet, traditional attack methods to create adversarial
examples, such as projected gradient descent (PGD) do not extend directly to
ECG signals, as they generate examples that introduce square wave artifacts
that are not physiologically plausible. Here, we developed a method to
construct smoothed adversarial examples for single-lead ECG. First, we
implemented a neural network model achieving state-of-the-art performance on
the data from the 2017 PhysioNet/Computing-in-Cardiology Challenge for
arrhythmia detection from single lead ECG classification. For this model, we
utilized a new technique to generate smoothed examples to produce signals that
are 1) indistinguishable to cardiologists from the original examples and 2)
incorrectly classified by the neural network. Finally, we show that adversarial
examples are not unique and provide a general technique to collate and perturb

allows for the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ to access the region
$-2<w_{\rm DE}<-1$ without ghosts. Indeed, this peculiar evolution of $w_{\rm

large-scale temperature anisotropies. The CMB temperature and polarization data

include a thermal emission term. The temperature of this emission $T_{\rm th}$
turns out to be proportional to the saturation scale, $T_{\rm th} = 1.8/2\pi
\,Q_s$. The formalism for the calculation of the transverse momenta spectra in
CGC/saturation approach is developed, in which two stages of the process are
seen: creation of the colour glass condensate, and hadronization of the gluon
jets. Our calculations are based on the observation that even for small values
of $p_T$, the main contribution in the integration over the dipole sizes stems
from the kinematic region in vicinity of the saturation momentum, where
theoretically, we know the scattering amplitude. Non-perturbativ corrections
need to be included in the model of hadronization. This model incorporates the
decay of a gluon jet with effective mass $m^2_{\rm eff} = 2 Q_s \mu_{\rm soft}$
where $\mu_{\rm soft}$ denotes the soft scale, with the fragmentation functions
at all values of the transverse momenta. We use the KLN model which, provides a
simple way to estimate the cross sections for the different centrality classes.
Comparing the results of this paper with the transverse distribution in the
proton-proton scattering, we see two major differences. First, a larger
contribution of the thermal radiation term is needed, in accord with higher
parton densities of the produced colour glass condensate. Second, even changing
the model for the hadronization, without a thermal radiation term, we fail to
describe the $p_T$ spectrum. Consequently, we conjecture that theexistence of
the thermal radiation term is independent of the model of confinement.

$\text{SU}(2)\!\times\!\text{SU}(3)$-models are elliptic fibrations
characterized by the collision of two Kodaira fibers with dual graphs that are
affine Dynkin diagrams of type $\widetilde{\text{A}}_1$ and
$\widetilde{\text{A}}_2$. Once we eliminate those collisions that do not have
crepant resolutions, we are left with six distinct collisions that are related
to each other by deformations. Each of these six collisions has eight distinct
crepant resolutions whose flop diagram is a hexagon with two legs attached to
two adjacent nodes. Hence, we consider 48 distinct resolutions that are
connected to each other by deformations and flops. We determine topological
invariants---such as Euler characteristics, Hodge numbers, and triple
intersections of fibral divisors---for each of the crepant resolutions. We
analyze the physics of these fibrations when used as compactifications of
M-theory and F-theory on Calabi--Yau threefolds yielding 5d ${\mathcal N}=1$

prepotential in the Coulomb branch of the theory and check that the

that contrary to the input layer which is robust to adversarial attack, the
latent layer of these robust models are highly susceptible to adversarial

new technique Latent Adversarial Training (LAT) which comprises of fine-tuning
the adversarially trained models to ensure the robustness at the feature

in a context where the inflaton is the only mediator between the visible and
the hidden sectors of our universe. Due to the relatively large mass of the
inflaton field, such a portal leads to an extremely feeble interaction between
the dark and the visible sectors suggesting that the dark sector cannot reach
any thermal equilibrium with the visible sector. After the two sectors are
populated by the decay of the inflaton, a heavy dark-matter particle thermally
decouples within the dark sector. Later, a lighter dark particle, whose decay
width is naturally suppressed by the inflaton propagator, decays into the
visible sector after it dominates the energy density of universe. This process
dilutes the dark-matter relic density by injecting entropy in the visible
sector. We show that an inflaton mass of $\mathcal{O}(10^{13})$ GeV together
with couplings of order one are fully compatible with a dark-matter relic
abundance $\Omega h^2\sim 0.1$. As a general feature of the model, the entropy
dilution mechanism is accompanied by a period of early matter domination, which
modifies the amount of e-folds of inflation necessary to accommodate Planck
data. Moreover, the coupling of the inflaton to the dark and visible sectors
brings loop contributions to the inflationary potential which can destabilize
the inflation trajectory. Considering all these complementary constraints, we
show that, in the context of a plateau-inflation scenario such as the
$\alpha$-attractor model, the inflaton can constitute a viable mediator between
the visible sector and a $\sim 10$ EeV dark-matter candidate. Furthermore, we
show that improved constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral index
could potentially rule out dark-matter scenarios of this sort in the future.

a phase that locally purifies at a constant system-size-independent rate, and
(ii) a ""mixed"" phase where the purification time diverges exponentially in the

existence of a quantum error-protected subspace where quantum information is
reliably encoded against the future non-unitary evolution of the system. We
show that these codes are of potential relevance to fault-tolerant quantum
computation as they are often highly degenerate and satisfy optimal tradeoffs
between encoded information densities and error thresholds. In spatially local
models in 1+1 dimensions, this phase transition for mixed initial states occurs
concurrently with a recently identified class of entanglement phase transitions
for pure initial states. The mutual information of an initially
completely-mixed state in 1+1 dimensions grows sublinearly in time due to the
formation of the error protected subspace. The purification transition studied
here also generalizes to systems with long-range interactions, where
conventional notions of entanglement transitions have to be reformulated.
Purification dynamics is likely a more robust probe of the transition in
experiments, where imperfections generically reduce entanglement and drive the
system towards mixed states. We describe the motivations for studying this
novel class of non-equilibrium quantum dynamics in the context of advanced
quantum computing platforms and fault-tolerant quantum computation.

galactocentric radius. We find both increasing and decreasing ionized gas lags

turbulent ejected gas likely resulting from star formation activity in the disk

divided the 2478 X-ray detected sources into 21 subsamples in bins of
specific-SFR (sSFR = SFR/M*) and constructed XLFs. To model the XLF dependence
on sSFR, we fit a global XLF model, containing contributions from high-mass
XRBs (HMXBs), low-mass XRBs (LMXBs), and background sources from the cosmic
X-ray background (CXB) that respectively scale with SFR, M*, and sky area. We
find an HMXB XLF that is more complex in shape than previously reported and an
LMXB XLF that likely varies with sSFR, potentially due to an age dependence.
When applying our global model to XLF data for each individual galaxy, we
discover a few galaxy XLFs that significantly deviate from our model beyond
statistical scatter. Most notably, relatively low-metallicity galaxies have an
excess of HMXBs above ~10^38 erg/s and elliptical galaxies that have relatively
rich populations of globular clusters (GCs) show excesses of LMXBs compared to
the global model. Additional modeling of how the XRB XLF depends on stellar
age, metallicity, and GC specific frequency is required to sufficiently
characterize the XLFs of galaxies.

Comments welcome",,"10.1093/mnras/stz2097",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Globular cluster (GC) systems demonstrate tight scaling relations with the
properties of their host galaxies. In previous work, we developed an analytic
model for GC formation in a cosmological context and showed that it matches
nearly all of the observed scaling relations across 4 orders of magnitude in
host galaxy mass. Motivated by the success of this model, we investigate in
detail the physical origins and evolution of these scaling relations. The ratio
of the combined mass in GCs $M_{\rm GC}$ to the host dark matter halo mass
$M_h$ is nearly constant at all redshifts, but its normalization evolves by a
factor of $\sim$10 from birth to $z=0$. The relation is steeper than linear at
halo masses $M_h \lesssim 10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$, primarily due to non-linearity
in the stellar mass-halo mass relation. The near constancy of the ratio $M_{\rm
GC}/M_h$, combined with the shape of the stellar mass-halo mass relation, sets
the characteristic $U-$shape of the GC specific frequency as a function of host
galaxy mass. The contribution of accreted satellite galaxies to the buildup of
GC systems is a strong function of the host galaxy mass, ranging from
$\approx$0% at $M_h \approx 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ to 80% at $M_h \approx 10^{15}
M_{\odot}$. The metal-poor clusters are significantly more likely to form
ex-situ relative to the metal-rich clusters, but a substantial fraction of
metal-poor clusters still form in-situ in lower mass galaxies. Similarly, the
fraction of red clusters increases from $\approx 10$% at $M_h = 10^{11}
M_{\odot}$ to $\approx 60$% at $M_h \approx 10^{13} M_{\odot}$, and flattens at
higher $M_h$. Clusters formation occurs essentially continuously at high
redshift, while at low redshift galactic mergers become increasingly important
for cluster formation.

population and nucleosynthesis studies to explore the role of SN Ia. We have
developed a new non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model of Mn,
including new photo-ionisation cross-sections and new transition rates caused
by collisions with H and H- atoms. We applied the model in combination with
1-dimensional (1D) LTE model atmospheres and 3D hydrodynamical simulations of
stellar convection to quantify the impact of NLTE and convection on the line
formation. We show that the effects of NLTE are present in Mn I and, to a
lesser degree, in Mn II lines, and these increase with metallicity and with
effective temperature of a model. Employing 3D NLTE radiative transfer, we
derive new abundance of Mn in the Sun, A(Mn)=5.52 +/- 0.03 dex, consistent with
the element abundance in C I meteorites. We also apply our methods to the
analysis of three metal-poor benchmark stars. We find that 3D NLTE abundances
are significantly higher than 1D LTE. For dwarfs, the differences between 1D
NLTE and 3D NLTE abundances are typically within 0.15 dex, however, the effects
are much larger in the atmospheres of giants owing to their more vigorous
convection. We show that 3D NLTE successfully solves the ionisation and
excitation balance for the RGB star HD 122563 that cannot be achieved by 1D LTE
or 1D NLTE modelling. For HD 84937 and HD 140283, the ionisation balance is
satisfied, however, the resonance Mn I triplet lines still show somewhat lower
abundances compared to the high-excitation lines. Our results for the benchmark
stars confirm that 1D LTE modelling leads to significant systematic biases in
Mn abundances across the full wavelength range from the blue to the IR. We also
produce a list of Mn lines that are not significantly biased by 3D and can be
reliably, within the 0.1 dex uncertainty, modelled in 1D NLTE.

electron-positron pair in the presence of strong electromagnetic backgrounds is
calculated. Of particular interest is the constant-crossed-field limit,
relevant for experiments that aim to measure high-energy axion-like-particle
conversion into electron-positron pairs in a magnetic field. The total
probability depends on the quantum nonlinearity parameter - a product of field
and lightfront momentum invariants. Depending on the seed particle mass,
different decay regimes are identified. In the below-threshold case, we find
the probability depends on a non-perturbative tunnelling exponent depending on
the quantum parameter and the particle mass. In the above-threshold case, we
find that when the quantum parameter is varied linearly, the probability
oscillates nonlinearly around the spontaneous decay probability. A strong-field
limit is identified in which the threshold is found to disappear. In modelling
the fall-off of a quasi-constant-crossed magnetic field, we calculate
probabilities beyond the constant limit and investigate when the decay
probability can be regarded as locally constant.

star clusters with and without a central IMBH to extract the distributions of
the stellar jerks and jounces. We then apply this technique to the ensemble of
MSPs in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tucanae. Current timing observations
are insufficient to constrain the presence of an IMBH and can only be used to
pose upper limits on its mass. But, with few more years of observations it will
be possible to test for the presence of a central IMBH with mass smaller than

integral-field spectroscopy from VLT/MUSE to investigate how star formation
within bars is connected to structural properties of the bar and the host
galaxy. We derived spatially resolved H$\alpha$ fluxes from MUSE observations
from the CARS survey to estimate star formation rates in the bars of 16 nearby
($0.01 < z < 0.06$) disc galaxies with stellar masses between $10^{10} M_\odot$
and $10^{11} M_\odot$. We further performed a detailed multicomponent
photometric decomposition on images derived from the data cubes. We find that
bars clearly divide into SF and non-star-forming (non-SF) types, of which eight
are SF and eight are non-SF. Whatever the responsible quenching mechanism is,
it is a quick process compared to the lifetime of the bar. The star formation
of the bar appears to be linked to the flatness of the surface brightness
profile in the sense that only the flattest bars $\left(n_\mathrm{bar} \leq
0.4\right)$ are actively SF $\left(\mathrm{SFR_{b}} > 0.5 M_\odot
\mathrm{yr^{-1}}\right)$. Both parameters are uncorrelated with Hubble type. We
find that star formation is 1.75 times stronger on the leading than on the
trailing edge and is radially decreasing. The conditions to host non-SF bars
might be connected to the presence of inner rings. Additionally, from testing
an AGN feeding scenario, we report that the star formation rate of the bar is
uncorrelated with AGN bolometric luminosity. The results of this study may only
apply to type-1 AGN hosts and need to be confirmed for the full population of

a first contact within the shortest possible amount of time and with minimal
energy consumption. For this purpose, over the last decade, a vast number of ND
protocols have been proposed, which have progressively reduced the relation
between the time within which discovery is guaranteed and the energy
consumption. In spite of the simplicity of the problem statement, even after
more than 10 years of research on this specific topic, new solutions are still
proposed even today. Despite the large number of known ND protocols, given an
energy budget, what is the best achievable latency still remains unclear. This
paper addresses this question and for the first time presents safe and tight,
duty-cycle-dependent bounds on the worst-case discovery latency that no ND
protocol can beat. Surprisingly, several existing protocols are indeed optimal,
which has not been known until now. We conclude that there is no further
potential to improve the relation between latency and duty-cycle, but future ND
protocols can improve their robustness against beacon collisions.

be effective in encouraging changes in behaviour. Therefore, we developed the
first privacy game for (Android) Wear OS watches. 10 participants used

they played a dynamically-customised privacy-themed game. To minimise
confounding variables, the other five received the same app but lacking the

of screen locks significantly increasing (p = 0.043). In contrast, 80% of the

Privacy concerns became more nuanced in the treatment group, with opinions

demonstrate the capabilities, privacy and security risks, and prevalence of a
particularly successful and active adware business: Wajam, by tracking its
evolution over nearly six years. We first study its multi-layer antivirus
evasion capabilities, a combination of known and newly adapted techniques, that
ensure low detection rates of its daily variants, along with prominent
features, e.g., traffic interception and browser process injection. Then, we
look at the privacy and security implications for infected users, including

code execution vulnerabilities. Finally, we study Wajam's prevalence through
the popularity of its domains. Once considered as seriously as spyware, adware
is now merely called ""not-a-virus"", ""optional"" or ""unwanted"" although its
negative impact is growing. We emphasize that the adware problem has been
overlooked for too long, which can reach (or even surplus) the complexity and

more so than many well-known and thoroughly-analyzed malware families.

Krattenthaler for rectangular shapes. Their proofs proceed by manipulations of

provide bijective proofs of such factorizations. The quantities involved have
known combinatorial interpretations in terms of Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns of
various types or half Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns, which can in turn be
transformed into perfect matchings of weighted trapezoidal honeycomb graphs. An
important ingredient is then Ciucu's theorem for graphs with reflective
symmetry. However, before being able to apply it, we need to employ a certain
averaging procedure in order to achieve symmetric edge weights. This procedure
is based on a ""randomized"" bijection, which can however also be turned into a
classical bijection. For one type of Schur polynomial factorization, we also
need an additional graph operation that almost doubles the underlying graph.
Finally, our combinatorial proofs reveal that the factorizations under

the short chaotic timescale. Its discovery and characterization was also
remarkable for the novelty of the detection technique and for the precise
characterization due to the large transit-timing variations caused by the close
proximity of the planets, as well as the precise stellar parameters due to
asteroseismology. This was the first multi-planet system whose transit data was
processed using a fully consistent photometric-dynamical model, using
population Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to precisely constrain system
parameters. Amongst those parameters, the stellar density was found to be
consistent with a complementary, concurrent asteroseismic analysis. In a first,
the 3D orientation of the planets was constrained from the lack of
transit-duration variations. The system yielded insights into the composition
and evolution of short-period planet systems. The denser planet appears to have
an Earth-like composition, with uncertainties comparable to the highest
precision rocky exoplanet measurements, and the planet densities foreshadowed
the rocky/gaseous boundary. The formation of this system remains a mystery, but

GS super-$p$-gerbes for $\,p\in\{0,1\}\,$ over the super-Minkowski space, whose
existence conforms with the classical results for the bosonic counterparts of
the corresponding super-$\sigma$-models. The study also explores the
fundamental gauge SUSY of the GS super-$\sigma$-model aka $\kappa$-symmetry.
Its geometrisation calls for a transcription of the field theory to the dual
topological Hughes-Polchinski formulation. Natural conditions for the
transcription are identified and illustrated on the example of the

extended HP $p$-gerbe unifying the metric and topological degrees of freedom of

an black holes in $d>4$ dimensions are studied, extending previous analysis for
$d=4$. The shell joins a Minkowski interior to a Tangherlini exterior, i.e., a
Schwarzschild exterior in $d$ dimensions, with $d\geqslant4$, The junction
conditions alone together with the first law of thermodynamics enable one to
establish that the entropy of the thin shell depends only on its own
gravitational radius. Endowing the shell with a power-law temperature equation
of state allows to establish a precise form for the entropy and to perform a
thermodynamic stability analysis for the shell. An interesting case is when the
shell's temperature has the Hawking form, i.e., it is inversely proportional to
the shell's gravitational radius. It is shown in this case that the shell's
heat capacity is positive, and thus there is stability, for shells with radii
in-between their own gravitational radius and the photonic radius, i.e., the
radius of circular photon orbits, reproducing unexpectedly York's thermodynamic
stability criterion for a $d=4$ black hole in the canonical ensemble.
Additionally, the Euler equation for the matter shell is derived, the
Bekenstein and holographic entropy bounds are studied, and the large $d$ limit
is analyzed. Within this formalism the thermodynamic properties of black holes
can be studied too. Putting the shell at its own gravitational radius, i.e., in
the black hole situation, obliges one to choose precisely the Hawking
temperature for the shell which in turn yields the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
The stability analysis implies that the black hole is thermodynamically stable
substantiating that in this configuration our system and York's canonical
ensemble black hole are indeed the same system. Also relevant is the derivation
in a surprising way of the Smarr formula for black holes in $d$ dimensions.

Submerged marine debris threatens marine life, and for shallow coastal areas,
it can also threaten fishing vessels [I\~niguez et al. 2016, Renewable and
Sustainable Energy Reviews]. Submerged marine debris typically stays in the
environment for a long time (20+ years), and consists of materials that can be
recycled, such as metals, plastics, glass, etc. Many of these items should not
be disposed in water bodies as this has a negative effect in the environment
and human health. This thesis performs a comprehensive evaluation on the use of
DNNs for the problem of marine debris detection in FLS images, as well as
related problems such as image classification, matching, and detection
proposals. We do this in a dataset of 2069 FLS images that we captured with an
ARIS Explorer 3000 sensor on marine debris objects lying in the floor of a
small water tank. The objects we used to produce this dataset contain typical
household marine debris and distractor marine objects (tires, hooks, valves,

the evaluated tasks, DNNs are a superior technique than the corresponding state

an ecological point of view since many decades, while there are no attempts to
describe it from a mathematical point of view. This paper introduces a new
mathematical model to describe the within-season population dynamics in an
ecological patch of a system composed by aphids, ants and ladybirds, through a
set of four differential equations. The proposed model is based on the
Kindlmann and Dixon set of differential equations, focused on the prediction of
the aphids-ladybirds population densities, that share a prey-predator
relationship. The population of ants, in mutualistic relationship with aphids
and in interspecific competition with ladybirds, is described according to the
Holland and De Angelis mathematical model, in which the authors faced the
problem of mutualistic interactions in general terms. The set of differential
equations proposed here is discretized by means the Nonstandard Finite
Difference scheme, successfully applied by Gabbriellini to the mutualistic
model. The constructed finite-difference scheme is positivity-preserving and
characterized by four nonhyperbolic steady-states, as highlighted by the
phase-space and time-series analyses. Particular attention is dedicated to the
steady-state most interesting from an ecological point of view, whose
asymptotic stability is demonstrated via the Centre Manifold Theory. The model
allows to numerically confirm that mutualistic relationship effectively
influences the population dynamic, by increasing the peaks of the aphids and
ants population densities. Nonetheless, it is showed that the asymptotical
populations of aphids and ladybirds collapse for any initial condition, unlike
that of ants that, after the peak, settle on a constant asymptotic value.

the ponderomotive potential of an optical travelling wave generated by two
femtosecond laser pulses at different frequencies in vacuum. The subsequent
dispersive propagation leads to a compression of the electrons and the
formation of ultrashort pulses. The longitudinal phase space evolution of the
electrons after compression is mapped by a second phase-locked interaction. The

multithreading model that supports searches, insertions and deletions in sorted
batches and has essentially optimal parallelism, even under the restrictive
QRMW (queued read-modify-write) memory contention model where concurrent
accesses to the same memory location are queued and serviced one by one.
  Specifically, if T has n items, then performing an item-sorted batch (given
as a leaf-based balanced binary tree) of b operations on T takes O( b *
log(n/b+1) + b ) work and O( log b + log n ) span (in the worst case as b,n ->
inf). This is information-theoretically work-optimal for b <= n, and also
span-optimal for pointer-based structures. Moreover, it is easy to support
optimal intersection, union and difference of instances of T with sizes m <= n,
namely within O( m * log(n/m+1) ) work and O( log m + log n ) span.
Furthermore, T supports other batch operations that make it a very useful
building block for parallel data structures.
  To the author's knowledge, T is the first parallel sorted-set data structure
that can be used in an asynchronous multi-processor machine under a memory
model with queued contention and yet have asymptotically optimal work and span.
In fact, T is designed to have bounded contention and satisfy the claimed work
and span bounds regardless of the execution schedule.
  Since all data structures and algorithms in this paper fit into the dynamic
multithreading paradigm, all their performance bounds are directly composable
with those of other data structures and algorithms in the same model. Finally,
the pipelining techniques in this paper are also likely to be very useful in
asynchronous parallelization of other recursive data structures.

solutions to enable mobility at MEC where connections are no longer anchored to
the core network and serving applications are supposed to move as their users
move. We propose the mobile-edge gateway (MEGW) to address this gap. MEGW
enables mobility for MEC applications transparently and without requiring any
modifications to existing protocols and applications. MEGW supports mobility by
reconstructing mobile users' location via listening to LTE control plane in
addition to using two-stage location-dependent traffic steering for edge
connections. Networks can incrementally upgrade to support MEC by upgrading
some IP router to programmable switches that run MEGW. We have implemented MEGW
using P4 language and verified its compatibility with existing LTE networks in
a testbed running reference LTE protocol stack. Furthermore, using packet-level
simulations we show that the two-stage traffic steering algorithm reduces the
number of application migrations and simplifies service provisioning.

forced axial motion of a rigid cylinder within an elastic liquid-filled tube.
The examined configuration is relevant to various minimally invasive medical
procedures in which slender devices are inserted into fluid-filled biological
vessels, such as percutaneous revascularization, interventional radiology,
endoscopies and catheterization. By applying the lubrication approximation,
thin shell elastic model, as well as scaling analysis and regular and singular
asymptotic schemes, the problem is examined for small and large deformation
limits (relative to the gap between the cylinder and the tube). At the limit of
large deformations, forced insertion of the cylinder is shown to involve three
distinct regimes and time-scales: (i) initial shear dominant regime, (ii)
intermediate regime of dominant fluidic pressure and a propagating
viscous-peeling front, (iii) late-time quasi-steady flow regime of the fully
peeled tube. A uniform solution for all regimes is presented for a suddenly
applied constant force, showing initial deceleration and then acceleration of
the inserted cylinder. For the case of forced extraction of the cylinder from
the tube, the negative gauge pressure reduces the gap between the cylinder and
the tube, increasing viscous resistance or creating friction due to contact of
the tube and cylinder. Matched asymptotic schemes are used to calculate the
dynamics of the near-contact and contact limits. We find that the cylinder
exits the tube in a finite time for sufficiently small or large forces.
However, for an intermediate range of forces the radial contact creates a
steady locking of the cylinder inside the tube.

flavour changing neutral currents (FCNC) at tree-level. So far there has been
no concrete mechanisms to suppress these FCNCs in 331-models. Recently it has
been shown that the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism can be incorporated into the

both the number of fermion families in nature and their mass hierarchy

associated universality class. To circumvent that, here we study a neural model
defined on a class of small-world network that share some topological features
with the human connectome. We found that varying the topological parameters can
give rise to a scale-invariant behavior belonging either to mean field
percolation universality class or having non universal critical exponents. In
addition, we found certain regions of the topological parameters space where
the system presents a discontinuous (i.e., non critical) dynamical phase
transition into a percolated state. Overall these results shed light on the
interplay of dynamical and topological roots of the complex brain dynamics.

underwater acoustic communication systems. However, the ocean acoustic
communication channel exhibits strong amplitude and phase fluctuations and the
phenomena of diffraction, refraction and reflection. Due to the complexity of
the environment, the motions of transducers, sea surface, etc., the underwater
acoustic signals exhibit random temporal and spatial frequency fluctuations in
both amplitude and phase. Therefore, it is very important to model a so complex
channel. Acoustic propagation is characterized by three major factors:
attenuation that increases with signal frequency, time-varying multipath
propagation, and low speed of sound (1500 m/s). The background noise, although
often characterized as Gaussian, is not white, but has a decaying power
spectral density. The channel capacity depends on the distance and may be
extremely limited. In this paper, we propose a new multipath channel model for
shallow underwater acoustic communications. In particular, our model takes into
account the effects due to spreading loss, scattering and reflections.

discrepancy to the friendship paradox in directed networks, which states that
people are less popular than their friends (or followers) are, on average. We
identify conditions on network structure that give rise to this perception

messages posted by Twitter users in our sample, we identify topics that appear
more frequently within the users' social feeds, than they do globally, i.e.,

three-dimensional (3D) InAs islands on the surface. Furthermore, exposing
static InAs 2D layers to Bi induces a rearrangement of the strained layer into
3D islands. We explore the effect of varying the InAs thickness and Bi flux for
these two growth approaches, observing a critical thickness for 3D island
formation in both cases. Characterization of (110) InAs quantum dots with
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals that larger islands
grown by the Stranski-Krastanov mode are plastically relaxed, while small
islands grown by the on-demand approach are coherent. Strain relaxation along
the [1-10] direction is achieved by 90 degree pure-edge dislocations with
dislocation lines running along [001]. In contrast, strain relief along [001]

time. Given a static underlying graph $G$, a temporal graph is represented by
assigning a set of integer time-labels to every edge $e$ of $G$, indicating the
discrete time steps at which $e$ is active. We introduce and study the
complexity of a natural temporal extension of the classical graph problem
Maximum Matching, taking into account the dynamic nature of temporal graphs. In
our problem, Maximum Temporal Matching, we are looking for the largest possible
number of time-labeled edges (simply time-edges) $(e,t)$ such that no vertex is
matched more than once within any time window of $\Delta$ consecutive time
slots, where $\Delta \in \mathbb{N}$ is given. The requirement that a vertex
cannot be matched twice in any $\Delta$-window models some necessary ""recovery""
period that needs to pass for an entity (vertex) after being paired up for some
activity with another entity. We prove strong computational hardness results
for Maximum Temporal Matching, even for elementary cases. To cope with this
computational hardness, we mainly focus on fixed-parameter algorithms with
respect to natural parameters, as well as on polynomial-time approximation
algorithms.

to anticipate an increasing number of undesirable long-term consequences of
their proposed rankings, from fueling the spread of misinformation and
increasing polarization to degrading social discourse. Can we design ranking
models that understand the consequences of their proposed rankings and, more
importantly, are able to avoid the undesirable ones? In this paper, we first
introduce a joint representation of rankings and user dynamics using Markov

the construction of consequential ranking models that trade off the immediate
utility and the long-term welfare. In particular, we can obtain optimal
consequential rankings just by applying weighted sampling on the rankings
provided by models that maximize measures of immediate utility. However, in
practice, such a strategy may be inefficient and impractical, specially in high

This increased cost imposes a major limitation on future multiple-input

mitigate the increased cost is to utilize hybrid architectures, in which the
received signal is combined in analog into a lower dimension, thus reducing the
number of RF chains. In this work we study the design and hardware

We first derive the optimal solution for complex-gain combiners and propose an
alternating optimization algorithm for phase-shifter combiners. We then present
a hardware prototype implementing analog combining for RF chain reduction. The
prototype consists of a specially designed configurable combining board as well
as a dedicated experimental setup. Our hardware prototype allows evaluating the
effect of analog combining in MIMO systems using actual communication signals.
The experimental study, which focuses on channel estimation accuracy in MIMO

Information leaks due to side channels are especially hard to detect and
analyze. In this paper, we present techniques for automated synthesis of
adaptive side-channel attacks that recover secret values. Our attack synthesis
techniques iteratively generate inputs which, when fed to code that accesses
the secret, reveal partial information about the secret based on the
side-channel observations, reducing the remaining uncertainty about the secret
in each attack step. Our approach is incremental, reusing results from prior
iterations in each attack step to improve the efficiency of attack synthesis.
We use symbolic execution to extract path constraints, automata-based model
counting to estimate probabilities of execution paths, and meta-heuristics to
maximize information gain based on entropy in order to minimize the number of
synthesized attack steps.

(LocalVC) introduced by Nanongkai~et~al. [STOC'19]. Roughly, given an
undirected unweighted graph $G$, a seed vertex $x$, a target volume $\nu$, and
a target separator size $k$, the goal of LocalVC is to remove $k$ vertices
`near' $x$ (in terms of $\nu$) to disconnect the graph in `local time', which
depends only on parameters $\nu$ and $k$. In this paper, we present a simple
randomized algorithm with running time $O(\nu k^2)$ and correctness probability
$2/3$.
  Plugging our new localVC algorithm in the generic framework of
Nanongkai~et~al. immediately lead to a randomized $\tilde O(m+nk^3)$-time
algorithm for the classic $k$-vertex connectivity problem on undirected graphs.
($\tilde O(T)$ hides $\text{polylog}(T)$.) This is the first near-linear time

for small $k$ takes $\tilde O(m+n^{4/3}k^{7/3})$ time [Nanongkai~et~al.,

  This work is inspired by the algorithm of Chechik~et~al. [SODA'17] for
computing the maximal $k$-edge connected subgraphs. Forster and Yang [arXiv'19]
has independently developed local algorithms similar to ours, and showed that
they lead to an $\tilde O(k^3/\epsilon)$ bound for testing $k$-edge and -vertex

obtain bounds that are near-linear in $k$, namely $\tilde O(k/\epsilon)$ and
$\tilde O(k/\epsilon^2)$ for the bounded and unbounded degree cases,
respectively. For testing $k$-edge connectivity for simple graphs, the bound
can be improved to $\tilde O(\min(k/\epsilon, 1/\epsilon^2))$.

Internet. However, complete reliance on Internet connectivity is impractical in
rural and remote environments where modern infrastructure is often lacking,
power outages are frequent, and/or network connectivity is sparse (e.g. rural
communities, mountainous regions of Appalachia, American Indian reservations,
developing countries, and natural disaster situations). This paper proposes
augmenting intermittent Internet with opportunistic communication to leverage
the social behaviors of patients, caregivers, and community members to
facilitate out-of-range monitoring of patients via Bluetooth 5 during
intermittent network connectivity in rural communities. The architecture is
evaluated for Owingsville, KY using U.S. Census Bureau, the National Cancer
Institute's, and IPUMS-ATUS sample data, and is compared against a delay
tolerant RPM case that is completely disconnected from the Internet. The
findings show that with only 0.30 rural adult population participation, the
architecture can deliver 0.95 of non-emergency medical information with an
average delivery latency of approximately 13 hours.

essential inference task, but it is computationally intractable in general. To
address the issue, iterative approximation algorithms exploring certain local

practice. However, due to their local/iterative nature, they often output poor
approximations or even do not converge, e.g., in low-temperature regimes (hard
instances of large parameters). To overcome the limitation, we propose a novel
approach utilizing the global spectral feature of GM. Our contribution is
two-fold: (a) we first propose a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme
(FPTAS) for approximating the partition function of GM associating with a
low-rank coupling matrix; (b) for general high-rank GMs, we design a spectral
mean-field scheme utilizing (a) as a subroutine, where it approximates a
high-rank GM into a product of rank-1 GMs for an efficient approximation of the
partition function. The proposed algorithm is more robust in its running time

To address the first problem, we formulate the image cropping as a listwise

refined view sampling (called RoIRefine) is proposed to extract refined feature
maps for candidate view generation. Given a series of candidate views, the

Specifically, we design a Context Aware Path with structure supervision

accretion-powered pulsar 4U 1626-67 observed with Suzaku and NuSTAR during a

2008, has a spin period of 7.7 s. Comparing the phase-averaged spectra obtained
with Suzaku in 2010 and with NuSTAR in 2015, we find that the spectral shape
changed between the two observations: the 3-10 keV flux increased by 5% while
the 30-60 keV flux decreased significantly by 35%. Phase-averaged and
phase-resolved spectral analysis shows that the continuum spectrum observed by
NuSTAR is well described by an empirical NPEX continuum with an added broad
Gaussian emission component around the spectral peak at 20 keV. Taken together
with the observed Pdot value obtained from Fermi/GBM, we conclude that the
spectral change between the Suzaku and NuSTAR observations was likely caused by
an increase of the accretion rate. We also report the possible detection of
asymmetry in the profile of the fundamental cyclotron line. Furthermore, we
present a study of the energy-resolved pulse profiles using a new relativistic
ray tracing code, where we perform a simultaneous fit to the pulse profiles
assuming a two-column geometry with a mixed pencil- and fan-beam emission
pattern. The resulting pulse profile decompositions enable us to obtain
geometrical parameters of accretion columns (inclination, azimuthal and polar
angles) and a fiducial set of beam patterns. This information is important to
validate the theoretical predictions from radiation transfer in a strong
magnetic field.

magnetic fields are an unambiguous signature of the Fermi surface, the defining
characteristic of a metal. Therefore, recent observations of QOs in insulating
SmB$_6$ and YbB$_{12}$, in particular the QOs of the resistivity $\rho_{xx}$ in
YbB$_{12}$, have been a big surprise, pointing to the formation of a novel
state of quantum matter. Despite the large charge gap inferred from the
insulating behaviour of $\rho_{xx}$, these compounds seemingly host a Fermi
surface at high magnetic fields. However, the nature of the ground state in
zero field has been little explored. Here we report the use of low-temperature
heat-transport measurements to discover gapless, itinerant, charge-neutral
excitations in the ground state of YbB$_{12}$. At zero field, despite
$\rho_{xx}$ being far larger than that of conventional metals, a sizable linear
temperature dependent term in the thermal conductivity is clearly resolved in
the zero-temperature limit
($\kappa_{xx}/T(T\rightarrow0)=\kappa_{xx}^0/T\neq0$). Such a residual
$\kappa_{xx}^0/T$ term at zero field, which is absent in SmB$_6$, leads to a
spectacular violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law: the Lorenz ratio
$L=\kappa_{xx}\rho_{xx}/T$ is $10^{4}$-$10^{5}$ times larger than that expected
in conventional metals. These data indicate that YbB$_{12}$ is a charge
insulator but a thermal metal, suggesting the presence of itinerant neutral
fermions. Remarkably, more insulating crystals with larger activation energies
exhibit a larger amplitude of the resistive QOs as well as a larger
$\kappa_{xx}^0/T$, in stark contrast to conventional metals. Moreover, we find
that these fermions couple to magnetic field, despite their charge neutrality.
Our findings expose novel gapless and highly itinerant, charge-neutral
quasiparticles in this unconventional quantum state.

in WTe2, much effort has been devoted to understanding the underlying
mechanism, which is still under debate. Here, we explicitly identify the
dominant physical origin of the large non-saturating MR through in-situ tuning
of the magneto-transport properties in thin WTe2 film. With an electrostatic
doping approach, we observed a non-monotonic gate dependence of the MR. The MR
reaches a maximum (10600%) in thin WTe2 film at certain gate voltage where
electron and hole concentrations are balanced, indicating that the charge
compensation is the dominant mechanism of the observed large MR. Besides, we
show that the temperature dependent magnetoresistance exhibits similar tendency
with the carrier mobility when the charge compensation is retained, revealing
that distinct scattering mechanisms may be at play for the temperature
dependence of magneto-transport properties. Our work would be helpful for
understanding mechanism of the large MR in other nonmagnetic materials and
offers an avenue for achieving large MR in the non-magnetic materials with
electron-hole pockets.

field of information security, has been paid more and more attention by
researchers. Most of the existing RDH schemes do not fully take it into account
that natural image's texture has influence on embedding distortion. The image
distortion caused by embedding data in the image's smooth region is much
smaller than that in the unsmooth region, essentially, it is because embedding
additional data in the smooth region corresponds to fewer invalid shifting
pixels (ISPs) in histogram shifting. Thus, we propose a RDH scheme based on the
images texture to reduce invalid shifting of pixels in histogram shifting.
Specifically, first, a cover image is divided into two sub-images by the
checkerboard pattern, and then each sub-image's fluctuation values are
calculated. Finally, additional data can be embedded into the region of
sub-images with smaller fluctuation value preferentially. The experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method has higher capacity and better
stego-image quality than some existing RDH schemes.

robustness is smaller than or equal to robustness of magic.

too large to fit in main memory precipitating the need for alternative
approaches for an efficient, scalable evaluation of queries on graphs of any
size.
  Here, we use the divide and conquer approach by partitioning a graph and
process queries over partitions to obtain all or specified number of answers.
This entails correctly computing answers that span multiple partitions or even
need the same partition more than once. Given a set of partitions, there are
many approaches to evaluate a query: i) One Partition At a Time approach, ii)
Traditional use of Multiple Processors, and iii) using the Map/Reduce
Multi-Processor approach. Approach (i), detailed in this paper, has established
scalability through independent processing of partitions. The other two
approaches address response time in addition to scalability. For approach (i),
necessary minimal book keeping has been identified and its correctness
established in this paper. Query answering on partitioned graphs also requires
analyzing partitioning schemes for their impact on query processing and
determining the number and the sequence in which partitions need to be loaded
to reduce the response time to process queries. We correlate query properties
and partition characteristics to reduce query processing time in terms of the
resources available.
  We also identify a set of quantitative metrics and use them to formulate
heuristics to determine the order of loading partitions for efficient query
processing. For approach (i), experiments on large graphs (synthetic,

  Emerging Technologies",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transportation systems are being reshaped by ride-sourcing and shared
mobility services in recent years. The transportation network companies (TNCs)
have been collecting high-granular ride-sourcing vehicle (RV) trajectory data
over the past decade, while it is still unclear how the RV data can improve
current dynamic network modeling for network traffic management. This paper
proposes to statistically estimate network disequilibrium level (NDL), namely
to what extent the dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) conditions are deviated in
real-world networks. Using the data based on RV trajectories, we present a
novel method to estimate the real-world NDL measure. More importantly, we
present a method to compute zone-to-zone travel time data from trajectory-level
RV data. This would become a data-sharing scheme for TNCs such that, while
being used to effectively estimate and reduce NDL, the zone-to-zone data
reveals neither personally identifiable information nor trip-level business
information if shared with the public. In addition, we present an NDL based
traffic management method to perform user optimal routing on a small fraction
of vehicles in the network. The NDL measures and NDL-based routing are examined
on two real-world large-scale networks: the City of Chengdu with
trajectory-level RV data and the City of Pittsburgh with zone-to-zone travel
time data. We found that, on weekdays in each city, NDLs are likely high when
travel demand is high (thus when congestion is mild or heavy).

applications of individualized (or personalized) treatment rules (ITRs). Policy
makers often wish to empirically evaluate ITRs and compare their relative
performance before implementing them in a target population. We propose a new
evaluation metric, the population average prescriptive effect (PAPE). The PAPE
compares the performance of ITR with that of non-individualized treatment rule,
which randomly treats the same proportion of units. Averaging the PAPE over a
range of budget constraints yields our second evaluation metric, the area under
the prescriptive effect curve (AUPEC). The AUPEC represents an overall
performance measure for evaluation, like the area under the receiver and
operating characteristic curve (AUROC) does for classification, and is a
generalization of the QINI coefficient utilized in uplift modeling. We use
Neyman's repeated sampling framework to estimate the PAPE and AUPEC and derive
their exact finite-sample variances based on random sampling of units and
random assignment of treatment. We extend our methodology to a common setting,
in which the same experimental data is used to both estimate and evaluate ITRs.
In this case, our variance calculation incorporates the additional uncertainty
due to random splits of data used for cross-validation. The proposed evaluation
metrics can be estimated without requiring modeling assumptions, asymptotic
approximation, or resampling methods. As a result, it is applicable to any ITR
including those based on complex machine learning algorithms. The open-source

input ports and the output ports needs to be computed in each switching cycle,
or time slot. Designing switching algorithms with very low computational
complexity, that lead to high throughput and small delay is a challenging
problem. There appears to be a fundamental tradeoff between the computational
complexity of the switching algorithm and the resultants throughput and delay.
Parallel maximal matching algorithms (adapted for switching) appear to have
stricken a sweet spot in this tradeoff, and prior work has shown the following
performance guarantees. Using maximal matchings in every time slot results in
at least 50% switch throughput and order-optimal (i.e., independent of the
switch size N) average delay bounds for various traffic arrival processes. On
the other hand, their computational complexity can be as low as $O(log^2N)$ per
port/processor, which is much lower than those of the algorithms such as
maximum weighted matching which ensures better throughput performance.
  In this work, we propose QPS-r, a parallel iterative switching algorithm that
has the lowest possible computational complexity: O(1) per port. Using Lyapunov
stability analysis, we show that the throughput and delay performance is
identical to that of maximal matching algorithm. Although QPS-r builds upon an
existing technique called Queue-Proportional Sampling (QPS), in this paper, we
provide analytical guarantees on its throughput and delay under i.i.d. traffic
as well as a Markovian traffic model which can model many realistic traffic
patterns. We also demonstrate that QPS-3 (running 3 iterations) has comparable
empirical throughput and delay performances as iSLIP (running $log_2 N$
iterations), a refined and optimized representative maximal matching algorithm

such as autonomous driving, drone piloting, and photo editing. Conventional
methods rely on some heuristics to handcraft various priors to remove or
separate the rain effects from an image. Recent deep learning models are
proposed to learn end-to-end methods to complete this task. However, they often
fail to obtain satisfactory results in many realistic scenarios, especially
when the observed images suffer from heavy rain. Heavy rain brings not only
rain streaks but also haze-like effect caused by the accumulation of tiny
raindrops. Different from the existing deep learning deraining methods that
mainly focus on handling the rain streaks, we design a deep neural network by
incorporating a physical raining image model. Specifically, in the proposed
model, two branches are designed to handle both the rain streaks and haze-like
effects. An additional submodule is jointly trained to finally refine the
results, which give the model flexibility to control the strength of removing
the mist. Extensive experiments on several datasets show that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art in both objective assessments and visual
quality.

galaxy using cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. Our goal is to explore
whether the progenitors of the lowest mass dwarf galaxies known to harbor
neutral hydrogen today (M_star~10^6 solar mass, M_halo=4x10^9 solar mass) could
possibly be detected as Damped Lyman-alpha Absorbers (DLAs) over cosmic time.
We trace the evolution of a single dwarf galaxy, pre-selected to contain DLAs,
from the era of the first metal-free, so-called Population~III (Pop~III),
stars, down to z=0, thus allowing us to study the metal enrichment history of
DLAs associated with the simulated galaxy. We find that the progenitors of the
simulated dwarf are expected to be seen for most of their evolution as DLAs
that are contaminated by normal, Population~II, stars. The time period during
which DLAs are only metal-enriched by Pop~III stars, on the other hand, is
likely very brief, confined to high redshifts, z~6. The susceptibility of the
dwarfs to the external UV radiation background allows them to preserve neutral
gas only at the centre (a few ~100 pc). This results in a small probability
that the simulated dwarf would be observed as a DLA. This study suggests that
DLAs are unlikely to be hosted in the lowest mass dwarfs that can harbor
neutral gas (M_halo~ 4x10^9 solar mass), below which neutral gas is unlikely to
exist. However, this study does illustrate that, when detected, absorption
lines provide a powerful method for probing ISM conditions inside the smallest
dwarf galaxies at intermediate to high redshifts.

offloaded to remote cloud systems. However, due to network latency, interactive
remote rendering (IRR) introduces the challenge of interaction latency (IL),
which is the time between an action and response to that action. Objectives: to
model sources of latency, measure it in a real-world network and to use this
understanding to simulate latency so that we have a controlled platform for
experimental work in latency management. Method: we present a seven-parameter
model of latency for a typical IRR system; we describe new, minimally intrusive
software methods for measuring latency in a 3D graphics environment and create
a novel latency simulator tool in software. Results: We demonstrate our latency
simulator is comparable to real-world behavior and confirm that real-world
latency exceeds the interactive limit of 70ms over long distance connections.
We also find that current approaches to measuring IL are not general enough for
most situations and therefore propose a novel general-purpose solution.
Conclusion: to ameliorate latency in IRR systems we need controllable
simulation tools for experimentation. In addition to a new measurement
technique, we propose a new approach that will be of interest to IRR
researchers and developers when designing IL compensation techniques.

energized by the jet from the PMN J0948+0022 nucleus. This large-scale radio
component is found at almost the same position angle as that of the pc-scale
jet, indicating a stable jet direction up to ~1 Mpc. Its apparent one-sidedness
implies a moderate advancing speed ($\beta>0.27$). The kinematic age of 1 x
10^7 year of the jet activity is consistent with the expected NLS1 phase of
~10^7 year in the AGN lifetime. The VLBA image reveals the jet structure at
distances ranging from r=0.82 milliarcsec to 3.5 milliarcsec, corresponding to
approximately 100 pc, where superluminal motions were found. The jet width
profile ($\propto r^{1.12}$) and flux-density profile ($\propto r^{-1.44}$)

the problems's 3D stiffness matrix as a combination of 2D (in-plane) and 1D
(out-of-plane) integrals. Therefore, the assembly's computational complexity is
reduced to the one of a 2D problem. Additionally, the number of 2D integrals to
be computed becomes independent of the number of material layers that
constitute the laminated composite, it only depends on the number of different
materials used (or different orientations of the same anisotropic material).
Hence, when a high number of layers is present, the proposed technique reduces
by orders of magnitude the computational time required to create the stiffness
matrix with standard methods, being the resulting matrices identical up to
machine precision. The predicted performance is illustrated through numerical
experiments.

tension and depth, such normal form may be not trivial and exhibit a chaotic
dynamics (Wilton-ripples). Nevertheless we prove that for all the values of
gravity, surface tension and depth, initial data that are of size $\epsilon$ in
a sufficiently smooth Sobolev space lead to a solution that remains in an
$\epsilon$-ball of the same Sobolev space up to times of order $\epsilon^{-2}$.
We exploit that the $3$-waves resonances are finitely many, and the Hamiltonian
nature of the Birkhoff normal form.

these data about users' cyberspace behaviors, various alternative data sources
on real-world users' behavior such as mobility may offer new insights for SES

which suffers from cycle skipping when the initial model is not
kinematically-accurate enough. To mitigate cycle skipping, wavefield
reconstruction inversion (WRI) extends the inversion search space by computing
wavefields with a relaxation of the wave equation in order to fit the data from
the first iteration. Then, the subsurface parameters are updated by minimizing
the source residuals the relaxation generated. Capitalizing on the
wave-equation bilinearity, performing wavefield reconstruction and parameter
estimation in alternating mode decomposes WRI into two linear subproblems,
which can solved efficiently with the alternating-direction method of
multiplier (ADMM), leading to the so-called IR-WRI. Moreover, ADMM provides a
suitable framework to implement bound constraints and different types of
regularizations and their mixture in IR-WRI. Here, IR-WRI is extended to
multiparameter reconstruction for VTI acoustic media. To achieve this goal, we
first propose different forms of bilinear VTI acoustic wave equation. We
develop more specifically IR-WRI for the one that relies on a parametrisation
involving vertical wavespeed and Thomsen's parameters delta and epsilon. With a
toy numerical example, we first show that the radiation patterns of the virtual
sources generate similar wavenumber filtering and parameter cross-talks in
classical FWI and IR-WRI. Bound constraints and TV regularization in IR-WRI
fully remove these undesired effects for an idealized piecewise constant
target. We show with a more realistic long-offset case study representative of
the North Sea that anisotropic IR-WRI successfully reconstruct the vertical
wavespeed starting from a laterally homogeneous model and update the
long-wavelengths of the starting epsilon model, while a smooth delta model is
used as a passive background model.

packet in quantum nonlinear Schr\""odinger lattices with a disordered potential.
A class of nonlinear lattices with subquadratic power nonlinearity is
considered. We show that there exists a parameter range for which an initially
localized wave packet can spread along the lattice to unlimited distances, but
the phenomenon is purely quantum and is hindered in the corresponding classical
lattices. The mechanism for this spreading assumes that the components of the
wave field may form coupled states by tunneling under the topological barriers
caused by multiple discontinuities in the operator space. Then these coupled
states thought of as quasiparticle states can propagate to long distances on
L\'evy flights with a distribution of waiting times. The overall process is
subdiffusive and occurs as a competition between long-distance jumps of the
quasiparticle states, on the one hand, and long-time trapping phenomena
mediated by clustering of unstable modes in wave number space, on the other
hand. The kinetic description of the transport, discussed in this work, is
based on fractional-derivative equations allowing for both non-Markovianity of
the spreading process as a result of attractive interaction among the unstable
modes and the effect of long-range correlations in wave number space tending to
introduce fast channels for the transport, the so-called stripes. We argue that
the notion of stripes is key to understand the topological constraints behind
the quantum spreading, and we involve the idea of stripy ordering to obtain
self-consistently the parameters of the associated waiting-time and jump-length

  Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-20)",,,,"cs.LG eess.IV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aggregating multi-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data
is indispensable for generating valid and general inferences from patterns
distributed across human brains. The disparities in anatomical structures and
functional topographies of human brains warrant aligning fMRI data across
subjects. However, the existing functional alignment methods cannot handle well
various kinds of fMRI datasets today, especially when they are not
temporally-aligned, i.e., some of the subjects probably lack the responses to
some stimuli, or different subjects might follow different sequences of
stimuli. In this paper, a cross-subject graph that depicts the
(dis)similarities between samples across subjects is used as a priori for
developing a more flexible framework that suits an assortment of fMRI datasets.
However, the high dimension of fMRI data and the use of multiple subjects makes
the crude framework time-consuming or unpractical. To address this issue, we
further regularize the framework, so that a novel feasible kernel-based
optimization, which permits nonlinear feature extraction, could be
theoretically developed. Specifically, a low-dimension assumption is imposed on
each new feature space to avoid overfitting caused by the
highspatial-low-temporal resolution of fMRI data. Experimental results on five
datasets suggest that the proposed method is not only superior to several
state-of-the-art methods on temporally-aligned fMRI data, but also suitable for
dealing `with temporally-unaligned fMRI data.

training the self-supervised learning with the adversarial process. In
particular, we apply self-supervised learning via the geometric transformation
on input images and assign the pseudo-labels to these transformed images. (i)
In addition to the GAN task, which distinguishes data (real) versus generated
(fake) samples, we train the discriminator to predict the correct pseudo-labels
of real transformed samples (classification task). Importantly, we find out
that simultaneously training the discriminator to classify the fake class from
the pseudo-classes of real samples for the classification task will improve the
discriminator and subsequently lead better guides to train generator. (ii) The
generator is trained by attempting to confuse the discriminator for not only
the GAN task but also the classification task. For the classification task, the
generator tries to confuse the discriminator recognizing the transformation of
its output as one of the real transformed classes. Especially, we exploit that
when the generator creates samples that result in a similar loss (via
cross-entropy) as that of the real ones, the training is more stable and the
generator distribution tends to match better the data distribution. When
integrating our techniques into a state-of-the-art Auto-Encoder (AE) based-GAN

points can be modeled as networks of coupled multistable subsystems, e.g.
coupled patches of vegetation, connected lakes, interacting climate tipping
elements or multiscale infrastructure systems. In such networks, tipping events
in one subsystem are able to induce tipping cascades via domino effects. Here,
we investigate the effects of network topology on the occurrence of such

higher-order mode waveforms in order to fold in the extra information from the
full waveform. We use mock data to demonstrate the effectiveness of this
method. We apply the method to each binary black hole event in the first
gravitational-wave transient catalog GWTC-1 to obtain posterior distributions

Such methods are proper orthogonal decomposition with interpolation (PODI) and
dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The ROM proposed will be enhanced by active
subspaces (AS) as a pre-processing tool that reduce the parameter space
dimension and suggest better sampling of the input space. We will focus on
geometrical parameters describing the perturbation of a reference bulbous bow
through the free form deformation (FFD) technique. The ROM are based on a
finite volume method (FV) to simulate the multi-phase incompressible flow
around the deformed hulls. In previous works we studied the reduction of the
parameter space in naval engineering through AS [38, 10] focusing on different
parts of the hull. PODI and DMD have been employed for the study of fast and
reliable shape optimization cycles on a bulbous bow in [9]. The novelty of this
work is the simultaneous reduction of both the input parameter space and the
output fields of interest. In particular AS will be trained computing the total
drag resistance of a hull advancing in calm water and its gradients with
respect to the input parameters. DMD will improve the performance of each
simulation of the campaign using only few snapshots of the solution fields in
order to predict the regime state of the system. Finally PODI will interpolate
the coefficients of the POD decomposition of the output fields for a fast
approximation of all the fields at new untried parameters given by the
optimization algorithm. This will result in a non-intrusive data-driven
numerical optimization pipeline completely independent with respect to the full
order solver used and it can be easily incorporated into existing numerical
pipelines, from the reference CAD to the optimal shape.

these transitions, showing them to be direct analogues of previously studied
phase transitions in extended systems. The simplicity of the model allows us to
study features of dynamical phase transitions which are not readily accessible
for extended systems. In particular, we quantify finite-size and finite-time
scaling exponents using both numerical and theoretical arguments. Importantly,
we identify an analogue of critical slowing near symmetry breaking transitions
and suggest how this can be used in the numerical studies of large deviations.
All of our results are also expected to hold for extended systems.

will learn more valuable information. We call this property the instructiveness
of the virtual goal and define it by a heuristic measure, which expresses how
well the agent will be able to generalize from that virtual goal to actual
goals. Secondly, we reduce existing bias in HER by the removal of misleading

efficiently estimate reservoir properties. The theoretical framework we develop
allows incorporation of non-linear statistical models for seismic estimation
problems. Uncertainty quantification is performed with Approximate Bayesian
Computation. With the help of a synthetic example of estimation of reservoir
net-to-gross and average fluid saturations in sub-resolution thin-sand
reservoir, several nuances are foregrounded regarding the applicability of
unsupervised and supervised learning methods for seismic estimation problems.
Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by estimating posterior
uncertainty of reservoir net-to-gross in sub-resolution thin-sand reservoir
from an offshore delta dataset using 3D pre-stack seismic data.

chemistry, and the ages of the stellar populations and the gas characteristics
in the rings and surrounding disks. Four of the five rings are also bright in
the H-alpha emission line, and the spectra of the gaseous rings extracted
around the maxima of the H-alpha equivalent width reveal excitation by young
stars betraying current star formation in the rings. The integrated level of
this star formation is 0.1-0.2 solar mass per year, with the outstanding value
of 1 solar mass per year in NGC 7808. The difference of chemical composition
between the ionized gas of the rings which demonstrate nearly solar metallicity
and the underlying stellar disks which are metal-poor implies recent accretion
of the gas and star formation ignition; the star formation history estimated by
using different star formation indicators implies that the star formation rate
decreases with e-folding time of less than 1 Gyr. In NGC 809 where the UV-ring
is well visible but the H-alpha emission line excited by massive stars is
absent, the star formation has already ceased.

improvements in network throughput with simultaneous connectivity of a large
number of mobile wireless devices, unmanned aerial vehicles, and the Internet
of Things (IoT). In FD-MIMO, with a large number of antennae at the base
station and the ability to perform beamforming, the capacity of the physical
downlink shared channel (PDSCH) has increased a lot. However, the current
specifications of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) does not allow
the base station to perform beamforming techniques for the physical downlink
control channel (PDCCH), and hence, PDCCH has neither the capacity nor the
coverage of PDSCH. Therefore, PDCCH capacity will still limit the performance
of a network as it dictates the number of users that can be scheduled at a
given time instant. In Release 11, 3GPP introduced enhanced PDCCH (EPDCCH) to
increase the PDCCH capacity at the cost of sacrificing the PDSCH resources. The
problem of enhancing the PDCCH capacity within the available control channel
resources has not been addressed yet in the literature. Hence, in this paper,
we propose a novel beamformed PDCCH (BF-PDCCH) design which is aligned to the
3GPP specifications and requires simple software changes at the base station.
We rely on the sounding reference signals transmitted in the uplink to decide
the best beam for a user and ingeniously schedule the users in PDCCH. We
perform system level simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed
design and show that the proposed BF-PDCCH achieves larger network throughput
when compared with the current state of art algorithms, PDCCH and EPDCCH
schemes.

multidimensional signatures. Complementarity of these new and old approaches is

Chinese text, but its necessity has rarely been explored. In this paper, we ask
the fundamental question of whether Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is
necessary for deep learning-based Chinese Natural Language Processing. We
benchmark neural word-based models which rely on word segmentation against
neural char-based models which do not involve word segmentation in four
end-to-end NLP benchmark tasks: language modeling, machine translation,
sentence matching/paraphrase and text classification. Through direct
comparisons between these two types of models, we find that char-based models
consistently outperform word-based models. Based on these observations, we
conduct comprehensive experiments to study why word-based models underperform
char-based models in these deep learning-based NLP tasks. We show that it is
because word-based models are more vulnerable to data sparsity and the presence
of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, and thus more prone to overfitting. We hope
this paper could encourage researchers in the community to rethink the
necessity of word segmentation in deep learning-based Chinese Natural Language
Processing. \footnote{Yuxian Meng and Xiaoya Li contributed equally to this

secondly, QA provides a natural way of jointly modeling entity and relation;
and thirdly, it allows us to exploit the well developed machine reading

been investigated numerically in a three dimensional computational domain.
Simulations were conducted in both laminar and turbulent flow regimes of
Rayleigh number (Ra) spanning in the range (10^4 to 10^8) and (10^10 to 10^13),
respectively. In the present study, the length to diameter ratio of the
cylinders has been varied in the range 0.5 to 20. Three different stack
arrangements were considered for the numerical simulations by arranging three,
six and ten number of cylinders in a triangular manner. The present
computational study is able to appraise very interesting thermo-buoyant plume
structures around the stack of cylinders. The average Nusselt number (Nu) shows
a positive dependence on Ra for all L/D. The average Nu for a stack of
three-cylinders is marginally higher than that of six-cylinders followed by
ten-cylinders. Furthermore, at a particular Ra, Nu is significantly higher for
short cylinders (low L/D) and decreases with increase in L/D up to 10 or 15 and
remain constant for long cylinders. In addition, the present numerical results
are also compared with the stack of hollow cylinders. A new Nusselt number
correlation has been developed for different stacks as a function of Ra and
L/D, which would be useful to industrial practitioners and academic
researchers.

reachability have been studied for VASS, we consider the long-run average cost
of infinite computations of VASS. The cost of a configuration is for each
state, a linear combination of the counter values. In the special case of
uniform cost functions, the linear combination is the same for all states. The
(regular) long-run emptiness problem is, given a VASS, a cost function, and a
threshold value, if there is a (lasso-shaped) computation such that the
long-run average value of the cost function does not exceed the threshold. For
uniform cost functions, we show that the regular long-run emptiness problem is

performs a valid topologically ordered clustering of the time series. The
clustering is superior in comparison to standard benchmarks when the data is

stars evaporated from the globular clusters (stellar streams) moving in a
galactic halo. Due to dynamical friction, the position of a globular cluster
(GC) as a stream progenitor starts to shift with respect to its original
position in the reference frame of initial GC orbit. Therefore the stars that
have evaporated at different times have different mean position with respect to
the GC position. This shifting results in a certain asymmetry in stellar
density distribution between the leading and trailing arms of the stream. The
degree of the asymmetry depends on the characteristics of the environment in
which the GC and the stream stars move. As GCs are located mainly in outer
parts of a galaxy, this makes dynamical friction a unique probe to constrain
the underlying dark matter spatial density and velocity distributions. For a GC
NGC 3201 we compared our theoretical shift estimates with available
observations. Due to large uncertainties in current observation data, we can
only conclude that the derived estimates have the same order of magnitude.

  Optimization",,,"10.1002/mp.14167",,"physics.med-ph math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A framework for online robust adaptive radiation therapy (ART) is presented.
This framework is designed to (i) handle interfractional geometric variations
following a probability distribution different from the a priori hypothesis,
(ii) address adaptation cost and (iii) address computational tractability. The
novelty of this framework is the use of Bayesian inference and
scenario-reduction, which is evaluated in a series of treatment on a
one-dimensional phantom geometry. The initial robust plan is generated from a
robust optimization problem based on either expected-value- or
worst-case-optimization approach using the a priori hypothesis of the
probability distribution governing the interfractional geometric variations.
The actual interfractional variations are evaluated in terms of their
likelihood with respect to the a priori hypothesis and violation of
user-specified tolerance limits. During an adaptation the a posteriori
distribution is computed from the actual variations using Bayesian inference.
The adapted plan is optimized to better suit the actual interfractional
variations of the individual case, which is used until the next adaptation is.
To address adaptation cost, the proposed framework provides an option for
increased adaptation frequency. Computational tractability is addressed by
scenario-reduction algorithms to reduce the size of the optimization problem.
According to the simulations, the proposed framework may improve target
coverage compared to the corresponding non-adaptive robust approach. Combining
the worst-case-optimization approach with Bayesian inference may perform best
in terms of improving CTV coverage and organ-at-risk~(OAR) protection. Bayesian
inference may have a greater impact on handling adaptation cost than increased
adaptation frequency. The concept of scenario-reduction may be useful to
address computational tractability in ART and robust planning.

since it has broad applicability in theoretical and applied sciences. TauRieL
utilizes an actor-critic inspired architecture that adopts ordinary feedforward
nets to obtain a policy update vector $v$. Then, we use $v$ to improve the
state transition matrix from which we generate the policy. Also, the state
transition matrix allows the solver to initialize from precomputed solutions
such as nearest neighbors. In an online learning setting, TauRieL unifies the
training and the search where it can generate near-optimal results in seconds.
The input to the neural nets in the actor-critic architecture are raw 2-D
inputs, and the design idea behind this decision is to keep neural nets
relatively smaller than the architectures with wide embeddings with the
tradeoff of omitting any distributed representations of the embeddings.

  a Duplicate-Free State-Space",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of task scheduling with communication delays is strongly NP-hard.
State-space search algorithms such as A* have been shown to be a promising
approach to solving small to medium sized instances optimally. A recently
proposed state-space model for task scheduling, known as Allocation-Ordering
(AO), allows state-space search methods to be applied without the need for
previously necessary duplicate avoidance mechanisms, and resulted in
significantly improved A* performance. The property of a duplicate-free state
space also holds particular promise for memory limited search algorithms, such
as depth-first branch-and-bound (DFBnB), and parallel search algorithms. This
paper investigates and proposes such algorithms for the AO model and, for
comparison, the older Exhaustive List Scheduling (ELS) state-space model. Our
extensive evaluation shows that AO gives a clear advantage to DFBnB and allows
greater scalability for parallel search algorithms.

the BIC approximation of the Bayes factor, a common default method for Bayesian

for correlation between repeated measurements. The minimal BIC method provides
a simple way for researchers to estimate Bayes factors from a minimal set of

sample an ensemble of possible complete sequences (particles), from which we
form a single consensus prediction that has low Bayes risk under our chosen

different missingness mechanisms, and modeling the complete sequences in each

its progenitor require a strong binary interaction. We examine scenarios that
attribute the extra power of iPTF14hls to a magnetar, to a late fallback on to
the neutron star (NS) that launches jets, to an interaction of the ejecta with
a circumstellar matter (CSM), or to a common envelope jets SN (CEJSN). For each
of these four scenarios, we study the crucial process that supplies the extra
energy and conclude that a binary companion to the progenitor must be present.
For the magnetar scenario and late jets we claim that a companion should
spin-up the pre-collapse core, in the ejecta-CSM scenario we find that the
formation of the equatorial CSM requires a companion, and in the CEJSN where a
NS spirals-in inside the giant envelope of the progenitor and launches jets the
strong binary interaction is built-in. We argue that these types of strong
binary interactions make the scenarios rare and explain the enigmatic nature of
iPTF14hls. We further study processes that might accompany the binary
interaction, in particular, the launching of jets before, during and after the
explosion and their observational consequences. We do not consider the
difficulties of the different scenarios and neither do we determine the best
scenario for iPTF14hls. We rather focus on the binary nature of these scenarios
that might as well explain other rare types of SNe.

three species develops through cooperative predation. Its rate equations in a
well-mixed environment display a degenerate Hopf bifurcation, occurring as
reactions involving two predators plus one prey have the same rate as reactions
involving two preys plus one predator. We estimate the magnitude of the
stochastic noise at the bifurcation point, where finite size effects turn
neutrally stable orbits into erratically diverging trajectories. In particular,
we compare analytic predictions for the extinction probability, derived in the
Fokker-Planck approximation, with numerical simulations based on the Gillespie
stochastic algorithm. We then extend the analysis of the phase portrait to
heterogeneous rates. In a well-mixed environment, we observe a continuum of
degenerate Hopf bifurcations, generalizing the above one. Neutral stability
ensues from a complex equilibrium between different reactions. Remarkably, on a
two-dimensional lattice, all bifurcations disappear as a consequence of the
spatial locality of the interactions. In the second part of the paper, we
investigate the effects of mobility in a lattice metapopulation model with
patches hosting several agents. We find that strategies propagate along the
arms of rotating spirals, as they usually do in models of cyclic dominance. We
observe propagation instabilities in the regime of large wavelengths. We also
examine three-agent interactions inducing nonlinear diffusion.

with models that take into account new processes and more realistic setups.
These models allow astrochemists to compute the evolution of chemical species
throughout star formation. Hence, comparing the outputs of such models to
observations allows to bring new constraints on star formation. The work
presented in this paper is based on the recent public release of a database of
radiation hydrodynamical low-mass star formation models. We used this database
as physical parameters to compute the time dependent chemical composition of
collapsing cores with a 3-phase gas-grain model. The results are analyzed to
find chemical tracers of the initial physical parameters of collapse such as
the mass, radius, temperature, density, and free-fall time. They are also
compared to observed molecular abundances of Class 0 protostars. We find
numerous tracers of the initial parameters of collapse, except for the initial
mass. More particularly, we find that gas phase CH3CN, NS and OCS trace the
initial temperature, while H2CS trace the initial density and free-fall time of
the parent cloud. The comparison of our results with a sample of 12 Class 0 low
mass protostars allows us to constrain the initial parameters of collapse of
low-mass prestellar cores. We find that low-mass protostars are preferentially
formed within large cores with radii greater than 20000 au, masses between 2

2.5e5 part.cm-3, corresponding to free-fall times between 100 and 200 kyrs.

and type-II X-ray bursts, allowing studies of the interaction of the accretion
disk with the magnetosphere at huge mass accretion rates exceeding $10^{19}$ g
s$^{-1}$ during its super-Eddington outbursts. The magnetic field strength in
the source, $B\approx 5\times 10^{11}$ G, is known from the cyclotron
absorption feature discovered in the energy spectrum around 4.5 keV. Here, we
explore the flux variability of the source in context of interaction of its
magnetosphere with the radiation-pressure dominated accretion disk.
Particularly, we present the results of the analysis of noise power density
spectra (PDS) using the observations of the source in 1996-1997 by RXTE.
Accreting compact objects commonly exhibit a broken power-law shape of the PDS
with a break corresponding to the Keplerian orbital frequency of matter at the
innermost disk radius. The observed frequency of the break can thus be used to
estimate the size of the magnetosphere. We found, however, that the observed
PDS of GRO J1744-28 differs dramatically from the canonical shape. Furthermore,
the observed break frequency appears to be significantly higher than what is
expected based on the magnetic field estimated from the cyclotron line energy.
We argue that these observational facts can be attributed to the existence of
the radiation-pressure dominated region in the accretion disk at luminosities
above $\sim$2$\times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We discuss a qualitative model for
the PDS formation in such disks, and show that its predictions are consistent
with our observational findings. The presence of the radiation-pressure
dominated region can also explain the observed weak luminosity-dependence of
the inner radius, and we argue that the small inner radius can be explained by
a quadrupole component dominating the magnetic field of the neutron star.

mechanical systems subject to fractional damping by establishing a restricted
Hamilton's principle. Fractional damping is a particular instance of non-local
(in time) damping, which is ubiquitous in mechanical engineering applications.
The restricted Hamilton's principle relies on including fractional derivatives
to the state space, the doubling of curves (which implies an extra mirror
system) and the restriction of the class of varied curves. We will obtain the
correct dynamics, and will show rigorously that the extra mirror dynamics is
nothing but the main one in reversed time; thus, the restricted Hamilton's
principle is not adding extra physics to the original system. The price to pay,
on the other hand, is that the fractional damped dynamics is only a sufficient
condition for the extremals of the action. In addition, we proceed to
discretise the new principle. This discretisation provides a set of numerical
integrators for the continuous dynamics that we denote Fractional Variational
Integrators (FVIs). The discrete dynamics is obtained upon the same
ingredients, say doubling of discrete curves and restriction of the discrete
variations. We display the performance of the FVIs, which have local truncation
order 1, in two examples. As other integrators with variational origin, for
instance those generated by the discrete Lagrange-d'Alembert principle, they
show a superior performance tracking the dissipative energy, in opposition to
direct (order 1) discretisations of the dissipative equations, such as explicit
and implicit Euler schemes.

on this dynamic detail of the model rules: in particular, the exponents for the
avalanche size distribution $P(S)\sim S^{-\tau_S}f(S/L^{d_f})$ and the
exponents describing the density of sites at the verge of yielding, which we
find to be of the form $P(x)\simeq P(0) + x^\theta$ with $P(0)\sim L^{-a}$

unpaired text style transfer. However, two major issues exist in most of the
current neural models. 1) It is difficult to completely strip the style
information from the semantics for a sentence. 2) The recurrent neural network
(RNN) based encoder and decoder, mediated by the latent representation, cannot
well deal with the issue of the long-term dependency, resulting in poor
preservation of non-stylistic semantic content. In this paper, we propose the
Style Transformer, which makes no assumption about the latent representation of
source sentence and equips the power of attention mechanism in Transformer to
achieve better style transfer and better content preservation.

Most of the RDH schemes for JPEG images will cause significant distortions and
large file size increments in the marked JPEG image. As a special case of RDH,
the lossless data hiding (LDH) technique can keep the visual quality of the
marked images no degradation. In this paper, a novel high capacity LDH scheme
is proposed. In the JPEG bitstream, not all the variable length codes (VLC) are
used to encode image data. By constructing the mapping between the used and
unused VLCs, the secret data can be embedded by replacing the used VLC with the
unused VLC. Different from the previous schemes, our mapping strategy allows
the lengths of unused and used VLCs in a mapping set to be unequal. We present
some basic insights into the construction of the mapping relationship.
Experimental results show that most of the JPEG images using the proposed
scheme obtain smaller file size increments than previous RDH schemes.
Furthermore, the proposed scheme can obtain high embedding capacity while
keeping the marked JPEG image with no distortion.

proteins, being involved in signaling, catalysis and other fundamental
activities in cells. However, modeling those processes is extremely difficult,
due to the need of efficiently exploring a vast conformational space in order
to seek for the actual transition path for systems whose complexity is already
high in the steady states. Here we report a strategy that simplifies this task
attacking the complexity on several sides. We first apply a minimalist
coarse-grained model to Calmodulin, based on an empirical force field with a
partial structural bias, to explore the transition paths between the apo-closed
state and the Ca-bound open state of the protein. We then select representative
structures along the trajectory based on a structural clustering algorithm and
build a cleaned-up trajectory with them. We finally compare this trajectory
with that produced by the online tool MinActionPath, by minimizing the action
integral using a harmonic network model, and with that obtained by the PROMPT
morphing method, based on an optimal mass transportation-type approach
including physical constraints. The comparison is performed both on the
structural and energetic level, using the coarse-grained and the atomistic
force fields upon reconstruction. Our analysis indicates that this method
returns trajectories capable of exploring intermediate states with physical
meaning, retaining a very low computational cost, which can allow systematic
and extensive exploration of the multi-stable proteins transition pathways.

distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over $d$-dimensional vectors, under the assumption
that $T$ is Toeplitz. This assumption arises in many signal processing
problems, where the covariance between any two measurements only depends on the
time or distance between those measurements. We are interested in estimation
strategies that may choose to view only a subset of entries in each vector
sample $x \sim \mathcal{D}$, which often equates to reducing hardware and
communication requirements in applications ranging from wireless signal
processing to advanced imaging. Our goal is to minimize both 1) the number of
vector samples drawn from $\mathcal{D}$ and 2) the number of entries accessed
in each sample.
  We provide some of the first non-asymptotic bounds on these sample complexity
measures that exploit $T$'s Toeplitz structure, and by doing so, significantly
improve on results for generic covariance matrices. Our bounds follow from a
novel analysis of classical and widely used estimation algorithms (along with
some new variants), including methods based on selecting entries from each
vector sample according to a so-called sparse ruler. In many cases, we pair our
upper bounds with matching or nearly matching lower bounds.
  In addition to results that hold for any Toeplitz $T$, we further study the
important setting when $T$ is close to low-rank, which is often the case in
practice. We show that methods based on sparse rulers perform even better in
this setting, with sample complexity scaling sublinearly in $d$. Motivated by
this finding, we develop a new covariance estimation strategy that further
improves on all existing methods in the low-rank case: when $T$ is rank-$k$ or
nearly rank-$k$, it achieves sample complexity depending polynomially on $k$
and only logarithmically on $d$.

dialogue systems. Despite the recent success of neural approaches for NLG, they
are typically developed for particular domains with rich annotated training
examples. In this paper, we study NLG in a low-resource setting to generate
sentences in new scenarios with handful training examples. We formulate the
problem from a meta-learning perspective, and propose a generalized
optimization-based approach (Meta-NLG) based on the well-recognized
model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm. Meta-NLG defines a set of meta
tasks, and directly incorporates the objective of adapting to new low-resource
NLG tasks into the meta-learning optimization process. Extensive experiments
are conducted on a large multi-domain dataset (MultiWoz) with diverse
linguistic variations. We show that Meta-NLG significantly outperforms other
training procedures in various low-resource configurations. We analyze the
results, and demonstrate that Meta-NLG adapts extremely fast and well to
low-resource situations.

still a mystery. We investigate if the radiation pressure in high-redshift
($z\sim 10$) galaxies can efficiently transport dust to halos. To clarify the
first dust enrichment of galaxy halos in the early Universe, we solve the
motion of a dust grain considering radiation pressure, gas drag, and gravity in
the vertical direction of the galactic disc. Radiation pressure is estimated in
a consistent manner with the stellar spectra and dust extinction. As a
consequence, we find that dust grains with radii $a\sim 0.1~\mu$m successfully
escape from the galactic disc if the ongoing star formation episode converts
more than 15 per cent of the baryon content into stars and lasts $\gtrsim 30$
Myr, while larger and smaller grains are trapped in the disc because of gravity
and gas drag, respectively. We also show that grain charge significantly
enhances gas drag at a few--10 scale heights of the galactic disc, where the
grain velocities are suppressed to $\sim 1$ km s$^{-1}$. There is an optimum
dust-to-gas ratio ($\sim 10^{-3}$) in the galactic disc and an optimum virial
mass $\sim 10^{10}$--$10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ for the transport of $a\sim
0.1~\mu$m grains to the halo. We conclude that early dust enrichment of galaxy
halos at $z\gtrsim 10$ is important for the origin of dust in the CGM.

pattern in words and permutations. We mainly focus on asymptotic properties of
the sequence $f_r^v(k,n),$ the number of $n$-array $k$-ary words that contain a
given pattern $v$ exactly $r$ times. In addition, we study the asymptotic
behavior of the random variable $X_n,$ the number of pattern occurrences in a
random $n$-array word. The two topics are closely related through the identity
$P(X_n=r) = $ $\frac{1}{k^n}f_r^v(k,n).$ In particular, we show that for any
$r\geq 0,$ the Stanley-Wilf sequence $\bigl(f_r^v(k,n)\bigr)^{1/n}$ converges
to a limit independent of $r,$ and determine the value of the limit. We then
obtain several limit theorems for the distribution of $X_n,$ including a CLT,
large deviation estimates, and the exact growth rate of the entropy of $X_n.$
Furthermore, we introduce a concept of weak avoidance and link it to a certain
family of non-product measures on words that penalize pattern occurrences but
do not forbid them entirely. We analyze this family of probability measures in
a small parameter regime, where the distributions can be understood as a
perturbation of a uniform measure. Finally, we extend some of our results for
words, including the one regarding the equivalence of the limits of the
Stanley-Wilf sequences, to pattern occurrences in permutations.

next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle. In the second case our analysis
applies to neutralinos promptly decaying to very light gravitinos, which are of
cosmological interest, and are generic for low, of order O(100) TeV, messenger
scale in gauge mediation models. We find that the lower bounds on the gluino
and the lightest stop masses are stronger for the gravitino LSP scenarios due
to the extra handle from the decay products of neutralinos. Generally, in
contrast to the neutralino LSP case the limits now extend to a region of
compressed spectrum. In bino scenarios the highest excluded stop mass increases
from 1000 GeV to almost 1400 GeV. Additionally, in the higgsino-like NLSP
scenario the higgsinos below 650 GeV are universally excluded and the stop mass
limit is $m_{\tilde{t}} > 1150$ GeV, whereas there is no limit on stops in the
higgsino LSP model for $m_{\tilde{h}} = 650$ GeV. Nevertheless, we find that

online algorithm is given some information concerning the request sequence.
This paradigm allows to establish tradeoffs between the amount of this
additional information and the performance of the online algorithm. However,
unlike real life in which advice is a recommendation that we can choose to
follow or to ignore based on trustworthiness, in the current advice model, the
online algorithm treats it as infallible. This means that if the advice is
corrupt or, worse, if it comes from a malicious source, the algorithm may
perform poorly. In this work, we study online computation in a setting in which
the advice is provided by an untrusted source. Our objective is to quantify the
impact of untrusted advice so as to design and analyze online algorithms that
are robust and perform well even when the advice is generated in a malicious,
adversarial manner. To this end, we focus on well- studied online problems such
as ski rental, online bidding, bin packing, and list update. For ski-rental and
online bidding, we show how to obtain algorithms that are Pareto-optimal with
respect to the competitive ratios achieved; this improves upon the framework of
Purohit et al. [NeurIPS 2018] in which Pareto-optimality is not necessarily
guaranteed. For bin packing and list update, we give online algorithms with
worst-case tradeoffs in their competitiveness, depending on whether the advice
is trusted or not; this is motivated by work of Lykouris and Vassilvitskii
[ICML 2018] on the paging problem, but in which the competitiveness depends on
the reliability of the advice. More importantly, we demonstrate how to prove
lower bounds, within this model, on the tradeoff between the number of advice

dimensions. This means that the standard model itself can not explain the
origin of the weak scale. On the other hand, from the results of recent
accelerator experiments, except for some small corrections, the standard model
has increased the possibility of being an effective theory up to the Planck
scale. From these facts, it is naturally inferred that the weak scale is
determined by some dynamics from the Planck scale. In order to answer this
question, we rely on the multiple point criticality principle as a clue and
consider the classically conformal $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant
two scalar model as a minimal model in which the weak scale is generated
dynamically from the Planck scale. This model contains only two real scalar
fields and does not contain any fermions and gauge fields. In this model, due
to Coleman-Weinberg-like mechanism, one scalar field spontaneously breaks the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry with a vacuum expectation value connected with the
cutoff momentum. We investigate this using the 1-loop effective potential,
renormalization group and large N limit. We also investigate whether it is
possible to reproduce the mass term and vacuum expectation value of the Higgs
field by coupling this model with the standard model in the Higgs portal
framework. In this case, the one scalar field that does not break
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ can be a candidate for dark matter, and have a mass of about
several TeV in appropriate parameters. On the other hand, the other scalar
field breaks $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and has a mass of several tens of GeV. These
results can be verified in near future experiments.

operate in wavelength regions, or at power levels, that are not compatible with
standard frequency to time mapping implementations. The recently developed
free-space angular chirp enhanced delay (FACED) removes many of these
limitations, and offers a linear frequency to time mapping in any wavelength
region where high-reflectivity mirrors and diffractive optics are available. In
this work, we present a detailed formulation of the optical transfer function
of a FACED device. Experimentally, we verify the properties of this transfer
function, and then present simple guidelines to guarantee the correct operation
of a FACED frequency to time measurement. We also experimentally demonstrate
the real-time spectral analysis of femtosecond and picosecond pulses using this

physics to economics. Getting numerical approximate solution of these problems
is a challenging issue of practical importance. In this work, we investigate
the relaxation of the OT problem when the marginal constraints are replaced by
some moment constraints. Using Tchakaloff's theorem, we show that the Moment
Constrained Optimal Transport problem (MCOT) is achieved by a finite discrete
measure. Interestingly, for multimarginal OT problems, the number of points
weighted by this measure scales linearly with the number of marginal laws,
which is encouraging to bypass the curse of dimension. This approximation
method is also relevant for Martingale OT problems. We show the convergence of
the MCOT problem toward the corresponding OT problem. In some fundamental
cases, we obtain rates of convergence in $O(1/n)$ or $O(1/n^2)$ where $n$ is
the number of moments, which illustrates the role of the moment functions.
Last, we present algorithms exploiting the fact that the MCOT is reached by a
finite discrete measure and provide numerical examples of approximations.

a focus of research in physics, going back to the early work of Landauer. One
of the most prominent aspects of computers is that they are inherently
nonequilibrium systems. However, the early research was done when
nonequilibrium statistical physics was in its infancy, which meant the work was
formulated in terms of equilibrium statistical physics. Since then there have
been major breakthroughs in nonequilibrium statistical physics, which are
allowing us to investigate the myriad aspects of the relationship between
statistical physics and computation, extending well beyond the issue of how
much work is required to erase a bit. In this paper I review some of this

the salient parts of information theory, computer science theory, and
stochastic thermodynamics, I summarize what has been learned about the entropic
costs of performing a broad range of computations, extending from bit erasure
to loop-free circuits to logically reversible circuits to information ratchets
to Turing machines. These results reveal new, challenging engineering problems

experience is the state of feeling present in virtual reality. Interruptions of
a presence experience - break in presence (BIP) - appearing over time, need to
be detected to assess and improve an application. Existing methods either lack
in taking these BIPs into account - questionnaires - or are complex in their
application and evaluation - physiological and behavioral measures -. To
provide a practical approach, we propose a post-experience method in which the
users reflect on their experience by drawing a line, indicating their
experienced state of presence, in a paper-based drawing template. The amplitude
of the drawn line represents the variation of their presence experience over
time. We propose a descriptive model that describes temporal variations in the
drawings by the definition of relevant points over time - e.g., putting on the
HMD -, phases of the experience - e.g., transition into VR - and parameters -
e.g., the transition time -. The descriptive model enables us to objectively
evaluate user drawings and represent the course of the drawings by a defined
set of parameters. An exploratory user study (N=30) showed that the drawings
are very consistent, the method can detect all BIPs and shows good indications
for representing the intensity of a BIP. With our method practitioners and
researchers can accelerate the evaluation and optimization of experiences by
evaluating BIPs. The possibility to store objective parameters paves the way
for automated evaluation methods and big data approaches.

considers firing frequencies that are sufficiently low for the membrane

are numerically fitted to functions of the Izhikevich neuron model parameters

  15th International Conference on Web and Internet Economics (WINE 2019)",,,,"cs.GT math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study oligopolistic competition in service markets where firms offer a
service to customers. The service quality of a firm - from the perspective of a
customer - depends on the congestion and the charged price. A firm can set a
price for the service offered and additionally decides on the service capacity
in order to mitigate congestion. The total profit of a firm is derived from the
gained revenue minus the capacity investment cost. Firms simultaneously set
capacities and prices in order to maximize their profit and customers
subsequently choose the services with lowest combined cost (congestion and
price). For this basic model, Johari et al. (2010) derived the first existence
and uniqueness results of pure Nash equilibria (PNE) assuming mild conditions
on congestion functions. Their existence proof relies on Kakutani's fixed-point
theorem and a key assumption for the theorem to work is that demand for service
is elastic (modeled by a smooth and strictly decreasing inverse demand
function).
  In this paper, we consider the case of perfectly inelastic demand, i.e. there
is a fixed volume of customers requesting service. This scenario applies to
realistic cases where customers are not willing to drop out of the market, e.g.
if prices are regulated by reasonable price caps. We investigate existence,
uniqueness and quality of PNE for models with inelastic demand and price caps.
We show that for linear congestion cost functions, there exists a PNE. This
result requires a completely new proof approach compared to previous
approaches, since the best response correspondences of firms may be empty, thus
standard fixed-point arguments are not directly applicable. We show that the
game is C-secure (see McLennan et al. (2011)), which leads to the existence of
PNE. We furthermore show that the PNE is unique, and that the efficiency
compared to a social optimum is unbounded in general.

availability and low latency in distributed applications. Conflict-free
Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are important building blocks in this domain
because they are designed to operate correctly under the myriad behaviors
possible in a weakly-consistent distributed setting. Because of the possibility
of concurrent updates to the same object at different replicas, and the absence
of any ordering guarantees on these updates, convergence is an important
correctness criterion for CRDTs. This property asserts that two replicas which
receive the same set of updates (in any order) must nonetheless converge to the
same state. One way to prove that operations on a CRDT converge is to show that
they commute since commutative actions by definition behave the same regardless
of the order in which they execute. In this paper, we present a framework for
automatically verifying convergence of CRDTs under different weak-consistency
policies. Surprisingly, depending upon the consistency policy supported by the
underlying system, we show that not all operations of a CRDT need to commute to
achieve convergence. We develop a proof rule parameterized by a consistency
specification based on the concepts of commutativity modulo consistency policy
and non-interference to commutativity. We describe the design and
implementation of a verification engine equipped with this rule and show how it
can be used to provide the first automated convergence proofs for a number of
challenging CRDTs, including sets, lists, and graphs.

develop an approach to infer the signal-idler entanglement and purity for a

has repeatedly been discussed in demographic research. While mortality
deceleration can be explained in the gamma-Gompertz model as an effect of
selection in heterogeneous populations, this phenomenon can be difficult to
assess statistically because it relates to the tail of the distribution of the
ages at death. By using a focused information criterion (FIC) for model
selection, we can directly target model performance at those advanced ages. The
gamma-Gompertz model is reduced to the competing Gompertz model without
mortality deceleration if the variance parameter lies on the boundary of the
parameter space. We develop a new version of the FIC that is adapted to this
non-standard condition. In a simulation study, the new FIC is shown to
outperform other methods in detecting mortality deceleration. The application
of the FIC to extinct French-Canadian birth cohorts demonstrates that focused
model selection can be used to rebut previous assertions about mortality
deceleration.

task in machine learning. Gaussian processes (GPs) are powerful and flexible
models for modeling time-series data. However, the high time complexity of GPs
limits their applications in online anomaly detection. Attributed to some
internal or external changes, concept drift usually occurs in time-series data,
where the characteristics of data and meanings of abnormal behaviors alter over
time. Online anomaly detection methods should have the ability to adapt to
concept drift. Motivated by the above facts, this paper proposes the method of
sparse Gaussian processes with Q-function (SGP-Q). The SGP-Q employs sparse
Gaussian processes (SGPs) whose time complexity is lower than that of GPs, thus
significantly speeding up online anomaly detection. By using Q-function
properly, the SGP-Q can adapt to concept drift well. Moreover, the SGP-Q makes
use of few abnormal data in the training data by its strategy of updating
training data, resulting in more accurate sparse Gaussian process regression
models and better anomaly detection results. We evaluate the SGP-Q on various
artificial and real-world datasets. Experimental results validate the
effectiveness of the SGP-Q.

the quantum many-body dynamics of a large ensemble of bosonic magnetic chromium
atoms with spin S = 3 in a three-dimensional lattice as a function of lattice
depth. Using extensive theory and experimental comparisons we study the
dynamics of the population of the different Zeeman levels and the total
magnetization of the gas across the superfluid to the Mott insulator
transition. We are able to identify two distinct regimes: At low lattice
depths, where atoms are in the superfluid regime, we observe that the spin
dynamics is strongly determined by the competition between particle motion,
onsite interactions and external magnetic field gradients. Contact spin
dependent interactions help to stabilize the collective spin length, which sets
the total magnetization of the gas. On the contrary, at high lattice depths,
transport is largely frozen out. In this regime, while the spin populations are
mainly driven by long range dipolar interactions, magnetic field gradients also
play a major role in the total spin demagnetization. We find that dynamics at
low lattice depth is qualitatively reproduced by mean-field calculations based
on the Gutzwiller ansatz; on the contrary, only a beyond mean-field theory can
account for the dynamics at large lattice depths. While the cross-over between
these two regimes does not correspond to sharp features in the observed
dynamical evolution of the spin components, our simulations indicate that it
would be better revealed by measurements of the collective spin length.

operate convolution on regular square image regions with fixed size and
weights, so they cannot universally adapt to the distinct local regions with
various object distributions and geometric appearances. Therefore, their
classification performances are still to be improved, especially in class
boundaries. To alleviate this shortcoming, we consider employing the recently
proposed Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for hyperspectral image
classification, as it can conduct the convolution on arbitrarily structured
non-Euclidean data and is applicable to the irregular image regions represented
by graph topological information. Different from the commonly used GCN models
which work on a fixed graph, we enable the graph to be dynamically updated
along with the graph convolution process, so that these two steps can be
benefited from each other to gradually produce the discriminative embedded
features as well as a refined graph. Moreover, to comprehensively deploy the
multi-scale information inherited by hyperspectral images, we establish
multiple input graphs with different neighborhood scales to extensively exploit
the diversified spectral-spatial correlations at multiple scales. Therefore,
our method is termed 'Multi-scale Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network' (MDGCN).
The experimental results on three typical benchmark datasets firmly demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed MDGCN to other state-of-the-art methods in both
qualitative and quantitative aspects.

solid crust-liquid core interface as well as in the core and the bulk
viscosity. It is found that neutron stars with slower frequency of rotation,
for the same mass, radius and surface temperature, are expected to emit
gravitational waves of higher intensity.

various scientific applications. The performance of the SpMV operation often
depends on exploiting regularity patterns in the matrix. Various
representations have been proposed to minimize the memory bandwidth bottleneck
arising from the irregular memory access pattern involved. Among recent
representation techniques, tensor decomposition is a popular one used for very
large but sparse matrices. Post sparse-tensor decomposition, the new
representation involves indirect accesses, making it challenging to optimize
for multi-cores and GPUs.
  Computational neuroscience algorithms often involve sparse datasets while
still performing long-running computations on them. The LiFE application is a
popular neuroscience algorithm used for pruning brain connectivity graphs. The
datasets employed herein involve the Sparse Tucker Decomposition (STD), a
widely used tensor decomposition method. Using this decomposition leads to
irregular array references, making it very difficult to optimize for both CPUs
and GPUs. Recent codes of the LiFE algorithm show that its SpMV operations are
the key bottleneck for performance and scaling. In this work, we first propose
target-independent optimizations to optimize these SpMV operations, followed by
target-dependent optimizations for CPU and GPU systems. The target-independent
techniques include: (1) standard compiler optimizations, (2) data restructuring
methods, and (3) methods to partition computations among threads. Then we
present the optimizations for CPUs and GPUs to exploit platform-specific speed.
Our highly optimized CPU code obtain a speedup of 27.12x over the original

differential equations (PDEs) with some closures due to the presence of
multi-scale physics that cannot be fully resolved. Therefore, reliable and
accurate closure models for unresolved physics remains an important requirement
for many computational physics problems, e.g., turbulence simulation. Recently,
several researchers have adopted generative adversarial networks (GANs), a
novel paradigm of training machine learning models, to generate solutions of
PDEs-governed complex systems without having to numerically solve these PDEs.
However, GANs are known to be difficult in training and likely to converge to
local minima, where the generated samples do not capture the true statistics of
the training data. In this work, we present a statistical constrained
generative adversarial network by enforcing constraints of covariance from the
training data, which results in an improved machine-learning-based emulator to
capture the statistics of the training data generated by solving fully resolved
PDEs. We show that such a statistical regularization leads to better
performance compared to standard GANs, measured by (1) the constrained model's
ability to more faithfully emulate certain physical properties of the system
and (2) the significantly reduced (by up to 80%) training time to reach the
solution. We exemplify this approach on the Rayleigh-Benard convection, a
turbulent flow system that is an idealized model of the Earth's atmosphere.
With the growth of high-fidelity simulation databases of physical systems, this
work suggests great potential for being an alternative to the explicit modeling
of closures or parameterizations for unresolved physics, which are known to be
a major source of uncertainty in simulating multi-scale physical systems, e.g.,

recognition that, since the late 1990, the sharp increase of technological

of colloidal-nano flows in porous media. For the first time, we explain the
phenomenon by distributed particle properties (size, shape, surface charge). We
discuss colloidal-nano transport with fines attachment considering
stochastically distributed filtration coefficient (particle attachment
probability) and the influence of area occupation by particles on the rock
surface. The distributed dynamic system allows for exact averaging (up-scaling)
yielding a novel 3x3 system of equations for total concentrations. Besides the
traditional equations of particle mass balance and capture-rate, the novel
system contains a third independent equation for kinetics of site occupation
during particle attachment. Ten laboratory tests exhibiting NRP have been
successfully matched by the upscaled system for binary colloids. Ten laboratory
tests with 7-parametric data arrays have been successfully matched by the
5-parameter model, which validates the model. The tuned parameters belong to
their common intervals. The laboratory data tuning was significantly simplified
by deriving the exact solution of upscaled equations. These results provide
valuable insights for understanding the transport mechanisms and environmental
impact in colloidal-nano flows exhibiting NRP. Besides, the upscaled system and
the analytical model for 1D transport facilitate interpretation of the
laboratory coreflood data and allows for the laboratory-based predictions for
3D colloidal-nano transport at the field scale.

classifying different types of skin lesions pictured in a given image. The
cores of the algorithms used were based in persistent homology, an algebraic
topology technique that is part of the rising field of Topological Data

persistent homology that captures the robustness of segmented regions. For
classification, we design two families of topological features from persistence
diagrams---which we refer to as {\em persistence statistics} (PS) and {\em
persistence curves} (PC), and use linear support vector machine as classifiers.
We also combined those topological features, PS and PC, into ResNet-101 model,

effective in two folds---improving classification performances and stabilizing
the training process. Although convolutional features are the most important

these spoken utterances is a complex research problem due to the presence of
multiple heterogeneous sources of information. Recent advances in multimodal
learning have followed the general trend of building more complex models that
utilize various attention, memory and recurrent components. In this paper, we
propose two simple but strong baselines to learn embeddings of multimodal

utterance into unimodal factors. Each unimodal factor is modeled using the
simple form of a likelihood function obtained via a linear transformation of
the embedding. We show that the optimal embedding can be derived in closed form
by taking a weighted average of the unimodal features. In order to capture
richer representations, our second baseline extends the first by factorizing
into unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal factors, while retaining simplicity and
efficiency during learning and inference. From a set of experiments across two
tasks, we show strong performance on both supervised and semi-supervised

Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We first define the Homotopic Convex (HC)
transformation of a TSP as a convex combination of a well-constructed simple
TSP and the original TSP. The simple TSP, called the convex-hull TSP, is
constructed by transforming a known local or global optimum. We observe that
controlled by the coefficient of the convex combination, with local or global
optimum, (i) the landscape of the HC transformed TSP is smoothed in terms that
its number of local optima is reduced compared to the original TSP; (ii) the
fitness distance correlation of the HC transformed TSP is increased. Further,
we observe that the smoothing effect of the HC transformation depends highly on
the quality of the used optimum. A high-quality optimum leads to a better
smoothing effect than a low-quality optimum. We then propose an iterative
algorithmic framework in which the proposed HC transformation is combined
within a heuristic TSP solver. It works as an escaping scheme from local optima
aiming to improve the global search ability of the combined heuristic. Case
studies using the 3-Opt and the Lin-Kernighan local search as the heuristic
solver show that the resultant algorithms significantly outperform their

generative network have efficiencies comparable to or better than the best
devices produced by adjoint-based topology optimization, while requiring less
computational cost. Our reframing of adjoint-based optimization to the training
of a generative neural network applies generally to physical systems that can
utilize gradients to improve performance.
