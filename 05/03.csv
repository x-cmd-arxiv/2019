like India and Brazil, is the use of WhatsApp to spread false or misleading
content. However, little is known about the information dissemination process
in WhatsApp groups. Attention affects the dissemination of information in
WhatsApp groups, determining what topics or subjects are more attractive to
participants of a group. In this paper, we characterize and analyze how
attention propagates among the participants of a WhatsApp group. An attention
cascade begins when a user asserts a topic in a message to the group, which
could include written text, photos, or links to articles online. Others then
propagate the information by responding to it. We analyzed attention cascades
in more than 1.7 million messages posted in 120 groups over one year. Our
analysis focused on the structural and temporal evolution of attention cascades
as well as on the behavior of users that participate in them. We found specific
characteristics in cascades associated with groups that discuss political
subjects and false information. For instance, we observe that cascades with
false information tend to be deeper, reach more users, and last longer in
political groups than in non-political groups.

consisting of two coupled fluids, namely a dark energy fluid coupled with a
superfluid dark matter fluid. The dark matter fluid is assumed to have a
superfluid equation of state, hence it is not pressureless and our aim is to
find the impact of this non-trivial equation of state on the phase space of the
coupled system. We shall use two theoretical contexts, namely that of classical
cosmology and that of loop quantum cosmology. In the classical case, we
investigated the existence and stability of fixed points, and as we will show,
no de Sitter fixed points occur, however matter and radiation domination fixed
points occur, which are hyperbolic and unstable. We also show that there exist
limited sets of initial conditions for which singular solutions occur in the
phase space. With regard to the loop quantum cosmology case, we demonstrate
that stable de Sitter fixed points exist, for some values of the free
parameters of the theory, and interestingly enough, for the same values,
singular solutions corresponding to general sets of initial conditions occur.
To our knowledge this feature does not occur so frequently in loop quantum
cosmological frameworks. We also demonstrate that non-singular solutions
corresponding to a general set of initial conditions occur, however these occur
when the dark matter superfluid has negative pressure, so it is a rather
physically unappealing situation.

cases can be explained by optical extinction of the AGN, but for more than half

Stokes V if a quarter wave retarder is used. Linear and circular polarization
terms are encoded with spatial carrier frequencies that differ by a factor two,
which minimizes cross-talk. Other rotating component polarimeters lend
themselves to the approach. Since the polarization modulation spatial
frequencies do not change greatly, if at all, with wavelength such devices are
close to achromatic, simplifying instrument design. Since the polarimetric
information is acquired in a single observation, rapidly varying, transient and
moving targets are accessible, loss of precision due to sequential data
acquisition is avoided, and moving parts are not required.

in an extended version of the above model, where the inverse harmonic
oscillator lives a in two dimensional noncommutative space. We show that,
without noncommutativity, Morita's conjecture survives in an essentially

the noncommutativity induced correction terms conspire to produce, in classical

Morita's analysis, we show that quantum mechanically an effective temperature

auctions where the auctioneer (buyer) aims to maximize his valuation function

mechanisms that have good approximation guarantees and never pay the
participating agents (sellers) more than the budget. We focus on the case of
general (non-monotone) submodular valuation functions and derive the first
truthful, budget-feasible and $O(1)$-approximate mechanisms that run in
polynomial time in the value query model, for both offline and online auctions.
Prior to our work, the only $O(1)$-approximation mechanism known for
non-monotone submodular objectives required an exponential number of value
queries.
  At the heart of our approach lies a novel greedy algorithm for non-monotone
submodular maximization under a knapsack constraint. Our algorithm builds two
candidate solutions simultaneously (to achieve a good approximation), yet
ensures that agents cannot jump from one solution to the other (to implicitly
enforce truthfulness). Ours is the first mechanism for the problem
where---crucially---the agents are not ordered with respect to their marginal
value per cost. This allows us to appropriately adapt these ideas to the online
setting as well.
  To further illustrate the applicability of our approach, we also consider the
case where additional feasibility constraints are present. We obtain
$O(p)$-approximation mechanisms for both monotone and non-monotone submodular
objectives, when the feasible solutions are independent sets of a $p$-system.
With the exception of additive valuation functions, no mechanisms were known
for this setting prior to our work. Finally, we provide lower bounds suggesting
that, when one cares about non-trivial approximation guarantees in polynomial
time, our results are asymptotically best possible.

$2$-vertex connectivity (biconnectivity). PRAM algorithms which run in $O(\log

diameter rounds in the MPC model. Our main results are, for an $n$-vertex,

information topology of Hellwig, the nested distance topology of Pflug-Pichler,
the extended weak convergence of Aldous and a topology built from Lasalle's
notion of a causal transference plan) are equal in finite discrete time.
Regrettably, the simple characterization of compactness given by Prokhorov's
theorem for the weak topology fails to be true in this finer topology. This
phenomenon is closely related to the failure of a natural metric for this
topology to be complete. For certain problems, a 'fix' consists in passing to
the metric completion. Still, it also seems interesting to find out what
compact sets look like in the uncompleted space.
  Here we give a characterization of compact sets in this adapted weak topology

new particles near the weak scale which come into thermal equilibrium. Without
a means to deposit this energy into the SM, these models are often excluded.
Scenarios of ""neutral naturalness"" especially, such as the Twin Higgs
frequently suffer from this.
  However, the Portalino, a singlet fermion that marries gauge neutral fermion
operators, can naturally help provide a portal for entropy to return to the SM
and to lift fermionic degrees of freedom in the Twin Sector. Together with
spontaneous breaking of the $Z_2$ ${\rm SM \leftrightarrow {\rm Twin}}$
symmetry, there are new opportunities to confront the cosmological challenges
of these models.
  Here, we attempt to develop such ideas. We shall show how one can lift many
of the light fields by breaking $\ztwo$ with a $U(1)_Y$ scalar and its Twin
partner. The introduction of Portalinos can lift the remaining degrees of
freedom. We shall find that such models are highly constrained by precision SM

  We present ParM, a novel, general framework for making use of ideas from
erasure coding and machine learning to achieve low-latency, resource-efficient
resilience to slowdowns and failures in prediction serving systems. ParM
encodes multiple queries together into a single parity query and performs
inference on the parity query using a parity model. A decoder uses the output
of a parity model to reconstruct approximations of unavailable predictions.
ParM uses neural networks to learn parity models that enable simple, fast
encoders and decoders to reconstruct unavailable predictions for a variety of
inference tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and object
localization. We build ParM atop an open-source prediction serving system and
through extensive evaluation show that ParM improves overall accuracy in the

astrophysical plasmas. Many important aspects of this process can be captured
by using the so-called Compton scattering kernel. For isotropic media, exact
analytic expressions (valid at all electron and photon energies) do exist but
are hampered by numerical issues and often are presented in complicated ways.
In this paper, we summarize, simplify and improve existing analytic expressions
for the Compton scattering kernel, with an eye on clarity and physical
understanding. We provide a detailed overview of important properties of the
kernel covering a wide range of energies and highlighting aspects that have not
been appreciated as much previously. We discuss analytic expressions for the
moments of the kernel, comparing various approximations and demonstrating their
precision. We also illustrate the properties of the scattering kernel for
thermal electrons at various temperatures and photon energies, introducing new
analytic approximations valid to high temperatures. The obtained improved
formulae for the kernel and its moments should prove useful in many
astrophysical computations, one of them being the evolution of spectral
distortions of the cosmic microwave background in the early Universe. A novel
code, CSpack, for efficient computations of the Compton scattering kernel and
its properties (in the future also including anisotropies in the initial
electron and photon distributions) is being developed in a series of papers and

  This work aims to provide elemental composition and FIP bias in quiescent
solar prominences. This is key information to link these features to remnants
of solar eruptions measured in-situ within the heliosphere and to constrain the
coronal or photospheric origin of prominence plasma.
  We used the differential emission measure technique to derive the FIP bias of
two prominences. Quiet Sun chromospheric and transition region data were used
to test the atomic data and lines formation processes. We used lines from low
stage of ionization of \ion{Si}{}, \ion{S}{}, \ion{Fe}{}, \ion{C}{}, \ion{N}{},
\ion{O}{}, \ion{Ni}{}, \ion{Mg,}{} and \ion{Ne}{}, constraining the FIP bias in
the range $4.2 \le \log T \le 5.8$. We adopted a density-dependent ionization

  We showed that the two prominences have photospheric composition. We
confirmed a photospheric composition in the quiet Sun. We also identified
opacity and/or radiative excitation contributions to the line formation of a
few lines regularly observed in prominences.
  With our results we thus provide important elements for correctly

communication constraints, in which the two hypotheses correspond to two
different states of a bipartite quantum system, multiple identical copies of
which are shared between Alice and Bob. They are allowed to perform local
operations on their respective systems and send quantum information to Charlie
at limited rates. By doing measurements on the systems that he receives,
Charlie needs to infer which of the two different states the original bipartite
state was in, that is, which of the two hypotheses is true. We prove that the
Stein exponent for this problem is given by a regularized quantum relative
entropy. The latter reduces to a single letter formula when the alternative
hypothesis consists of the products of the marginals of the null hypothesis,
and there is no rate constraint imposed on Bob. Our proof relies on certain
properties of the so-called quantum information bottleneck function.
  The second part of this paper concerns the general problem of finding finite
blocklength strong converse bounds in quantum network information theory. In
the classical case, the analogue of this problem has been reformulated in terms
of the so-called image size characterization problem. Here, we extend this
problem to the classical-quantum setting and prove a second order strong
converse bound for it. As a by-product, we obtain a similar bound for the Stein
exponent for distributed hypothesis testing in the special case in which the
bipartite system is a classical-quantum system, as well as for the task of
quantum source coding with compressed classical side information. Our proofs
use a recently developed tool from quantum functional inequalities, namely, the

vision and natural language processing. However, recent works have shown that
deep networks can be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which raised a
serious robustness issue of deep networks. Adversarial training, typically
formulated as a robust optimization problem, is an effective way of improving
the robustness of deep networks. A major drawback of existing adversarial
training algorithms is the computational overhead of the generation of
adversarial examples, typically far greater than that of the network training.
This leads to the unbearable overall computational cost of adversarial
training. In this paper, we show that adversarial training can be cast as a
discrete time differential game. Through analyzing the Pontryagin's Maximal
Principle (PMP) of the problem, we observe that the adversary update is only
coupled with the parameters of the first layer of the network. This inspires us
to restrict most of the forward and back propagation within the first layer of
the network during adversary updates. This effectively reduces the total number
of full forward and backward propagation to only one for each group of
adversary updates. Therefore, we refer to this algorithm YOPO (You Only
Propagate Once). Numerical experiments demonstrate that YOPO can achieve
comparable defense accuracy with approximately 1/5 ~ 1/4 GPU time of the

functionally graded materials with mechanical properties changing through its

approach is verified using a commercial finite element computer code. Although
the model is presented for a specific case in the present work, it can be
generalized to investigate coupling of shellplate structures via fluid. It is
shown that the coupling between concentric shells occurs only when they vibrate

sustained longitudinal electric fields of 200 GV m$^{-1}$, which produce

couplings to Standard Model (SM) and DM particles may be comparable to those in
the SM and the cosmological DM density is reached via resonant annihilation,
and one in which the mediator couplings to quarks are $\lesssim 10^{-3}$ and DM
annihilation is non-resonant. We find that the DM and mediator masses may well

We provide strong evidence for the validity of this conjecture by studying the

string theory. Specifically, we consider all possible infinite distance limits
in complex structure moduli space and identify the axion decay constants that
grow parametrically in a certain path-independent way. We then argue that for
each of these limits a tower of D2-brane instantons with decreasing actions can
be identified. These instantons ensure that the convex hull condition relevant
for the multi-axion Weak Gravity Conjecture cannot be violated parametrically.
To argue for the existence of such instantons we employ and generalize recent
insights about the Swampland Distance Conjecture. Our results are general and
not restricted to specific examples, since we use general results about the

preparing GKP states have been provided. Without careful consideration, a small
number of faults can lead to large uncorrectable shift errors. After proposing
a metric to compare approximate GKP states, we provide rigorous definitions of
fault-tolerance and introduce a fault-tolerant phase estimation protocol for
preparing such states. The fault-tolerant protocol uses one flag qubit and
accepts only a subset of states in order to prevent measurement readout errors
from causing large shift errors. We then show how the protocol can be
implemented using circuit QED. In doing so, we derive analytic expressions
which describe the leading order effects of the non-linear dispersive shift and
Kerr non-linearity. Using these expressions, we show that to mitigate the
non-linear dispersive shift and Kerr terms would require the protocol to be
implemented on time scales four orders of magnitude longer than the time scales
relevant to the protocol for physically motivated parameters. Despite these
restrictions, we numerically show that a subset of the accepted states of the

matter components of $z=0.6$ galaxies are more spherical than their progenitors
while stellar matter components tend to be less spherical than their
progenitors. The distribution of the galaxy-subhalo misalignment angle peaks at
$\sim10~\mathrm{deg}$ with a mild increase with time. The evolution of the
ellipticity-direction~(ED) correlation amplitude $\omega(r)$ of galaxies (which
quantifies the tendency of galaxies to preferentially point towards surrounding
matter overdensities) is governed by the evolution in the alignment of
underlying dark matter~(DM) subhaloes to the matter density of field, as well
as the alignment between galaxies and their DM subhaloes. At scales
$\sim1~\mathrm{cMpc}/h$, the alignment between DM subhaloes and matter
overdensity gets suppressed with time, whereas the alignment between galaxies

redshift evolution of $\omega(r)$ for galaxies at $\sim1~\mathrm{cMpc}/h$. At
scales $>1~\mathrm{cMpc}/h$, alignment between DM subhaloes and matter

$m_f=1723 MeV$ and width $\Gamma=139$ MeV is playing a significant role in
efficiently providing the strong (CP-conserving) and weak (CP-odd) phase
simultaneously in the recently observed direct CP asymmetry $\Delta A_{CP}$ by
the LHCb collaboration. The direct CP arises by the well known penguin-tree
interference wherein the virtual b-quark in the c-u penguin is the source of
the Kobayashi-Maskawa CP-odd phase, $\gamma$, in the SM. Loop (penguin)
corrections generate left-right operators enhancing coupling to the $0^{++}$
scalar resonance. The scalar resonance is likely rich in gluonic content
perhaps leading to a better understanding of large breaking of flavor SU(3)
that has been known for a long-time. Approximate calculations give a rough
understanding of the observed size of the CP asymmetry. The mechanism leads to
several interesting implications which can be experimentally studied and
tested. Moreover, in an analogous fashion to $f_0$, 4-quark operators also
generate $P \times P$, P being a pseudo-scalar bilinear, which may be dominated
by the nearby $\eta (1760)$ of width about 250 MeV that can influence final
states such as 4 $\pi$'s, $\eta^{\prime}(\eta) + \pi^+ + \pi^-$ etc which could
exhibit CP violating triple correlation or energy asymmetries. We also briefly
discuss CP violation in radiative charm decays and suggest that simple final
states $\gamma \rho$ and $\gamma \phi$ are best suited for sizeable asymmetries
as well as providing precise tests of the SM.

produce DCOs, which makes calculating such populations computationally
inefficient. We present an importance sampling algorithm, STROOPWAFEL, that
improves the computational efficiency of population studies of rare events, by
focusing the simulation around regions of the initial parameter space found to
produce outputs of interest. We implement the algorithm in the binary

probability distributions. STROOPWAFEL finds $\sim$25-200 times more DCO
mergers than the standard sampling method with the same simulation size, and so
speeds up simulations by up to two orders of magnitude. Finding more DCO
mergers automatically maps the parameter space with far higher resolution than
when using the traditional sampling. This increase in efficiency also leads to
a decrease of a factor $\sim$3-10 in statistical sampling uncertainty for the
predictions from the simulations. This is particularly notable for the
distribution functions of observable quantities such as the black hole and
neutron star chirp mass distribution, including in the tails of the
distribution functions where predictions using standard sampling can be

that photometric redshift galaxies are significantly positively associated with

the catalogue of filamentary spines is proposed to be a realisation of a random

a bivariate $J-$function, which is a summary statistics studying clustering. A
quotient $D$ was built to estimate the distance distribution of the filamentary
spine to galaxies in comparison to the distance distribution of the filamentary
spine to random points in $3-$dimensional Euclidean space. This measure gives a
physical distance scale to the distances between filamentary spines and the
studied sets of galaxies. The bivariate $J-$function shows a statistically
significant clustering effect in between filamentary spines and photometric
redshift galaxies. The quotient $D$ confirms the previous result that smaller
distances exist with higher probability between the photometric galaxies and
filaments. The trend of smaller distances between the objects grows stronger at
higher redshift. Additionally, the quotient $D$ for photometric galaxies gives
a rough estimate for the filamentary spine width of about $1$~Mpc. Photometric
redshift galaxies are positively associated with filamentary spines detected

its implied mixing angle under the assumption that all DM is made of sterile
neutrinos. The X-ray observations of the Limiting Window (LW) towards the
Galactic bulge (GB) offer a unique dataset for exploring DM lines. We
characterize the systematic uncertainties of the observation and the fitted

indirect DM column density constraints towards the GB to understand systematic
uncertainties in the assumed DM mass in the field of view of the observation.
We found tight constraints on the allowed flux for an additional line at 3.55

$\mathrm{F_X^{3.55keV}\approx(4.5\pm3.5)\times10^{-7}~cts~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$.
This would translate into a mixing angle of
$\mathrm{sin^{2}(2\Theta)\approx(2.3\pm1.8)\times10^{-11}}$ which, while
consistent with some recent results, is in tension with earlier detections. We
used a very deep dataset with well understood systematics to derive tight

analytic formalism. These metrics are typically based on the Fourier power
spectrum, which does not capture the Fourier phase information that carries the
morphological characteristics of images. In this work we use density slices of
magnetohydrodyanmic turbulence simulations to demonstrate that a modern tool,
convolutional neural networks, can capture significant information encoded in
the Fourier phases. We train the neural network to distinguish between two
simulations with different levels of magnetization. We find that, even given a
tiny slice of simulation data, a relatively simple network can distinguish
sub-Alfv\'enic (strong magnetic field) and super-Alfv\'enic (weak magnetic

methods and numerical simulations. A theoretical formulation is developed for
the probability distribution function (PDF) of the density at steady state,
connecting it to the conditional statistics of the velocity divergence. Two
sets of numerical simulations are carried out, using either a Riemann solver to
evolve the Euler equations or a finite-difference method to evolve the
Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations. After confirming the validity of our theoretical
formulation with the N-S simulations, we examine the effects of dynamical
processes on the PDF, showing that the nonlinear term in the divergence
equation amplifies the right tail of the PDF and reduces the left one, the
pressure term reduces both the right and left tails, and the viscosity term,
counter-intuitively, broadens the right tail of the PDF. Despite the inaccuracy
of the velocity divergence from the Riemann runs, as found in our previous
work, we show that the density PDF from the Riemann runs is consistent with
that from the N-S runs. Taking advantage of their much higher effective
resolution, we then use the Riemann runs to study the dependence of the PDF on
the Mach number, $\mathcal{M}$, up to $\mathcal{M}\sim30$. The PDF width,
$\sigma_{s}$, follows the relation $\sigma_{s}^2 = \ln (1+b^2 {\mathcal M}^2)$,
with $b\approx0.38$. However, the PDF exhibits a negative skewness that
increases with increasing $\mathcal{M}$, so much of the growth of $\sigma_{s}$
is accounted for by the growth of the left PDF tail, while the growth of the
right tail tends to saturate. Thus, the usual prescription that combines a
lognormal shape with the standard variance-Mach number relation greatly

other baselines models especially when classifying locale-specific domains and

January 2013 and July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and
classified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings were
summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria, 4 used a combination
of deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches, and 12 used only
deep learning approaches. The combination of traditional machine learning for
classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature selection produced
accuracies of up to 98.8% for AD classification and 83.7% for prediction of
conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to
AD. Deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) or
recurrent neural network (RNN), that use neuroimaging data without

AD classification and 84.2% for MCI conversion prediction. The best
classification performance was obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid
biomarkers were combined. AD research that uses deep learning is still

However, the Spitzer Space Telescope's failure to detect `Oumuamua not only
ruled out the CO_2 and/or CO driven activity (Trilling et al. 2018), but made
the cigar shape incompatible with the optical observations. Choice of water ice
as the source of outgassing is shown to be flawed as well: (i) the water
sublimation law is demonstrably inconsistent with the observed variations in
the nongravitational acceleration derived by Micheli et al. (2018), the point
that should have been assertively highlighted; and (ii) an upper limit of the
production rate of water is estimated at as low as 4 x 10^(23) molecules
s^(-1), requiring that, at most, only a small area of the surface be active. In
this case the conservation of momentum law is satisfied only when `Oumuamua's
bulk density is extremely low, <0.001 g cm^(-3), reminiscent of the formerly
proposed scenario with `Oumuamua as a fragment of a dwarf interstellar comet,
possibly an embryo planetesimal, disintegrating near perihelion, with the
acceleration driven by solar radiation pressure (Sekanina 2019a) and no need
for activity at all. High quality of astrometry and Micheli et al.'s orbital
analysis, whose results were confirmed by the computations of other authors, is

the uplink user to the downlink user. From an information theoretical
perspective, the overall network can be viewed as a generalization of the FD
relay broadcast channel with a side message transmitted from the relay to the
destination. We begin with a simpler case that involves the uplink and downlink
transmissions of $(m_1,m_2)$ only, and propose an achievable rate region based
on a novel strategy that uses the BS as a FD relay to facilitate the
interference cancellation at the downlink user. We also prove a new converse,
which is strictly tighter than the cut-set bound, and characterize the capacity
region of the scalar Gaussian FD network without a D2D message to within a
constant gap. This paper further studies a general setup wherein
$(m_1,m_2,m_3)$ are communicated simultaneously. To account for the D2D
message, we incorporate Marton's broadcast coding into the previous scheme to
obtain a larger achievable rate region than the existing ones in the

by using one of the two simple rate-splitting schemes, the capacity region of
the scalar Gaussian FD network with a D2D message can already be reached to

this formalism is the first quantization of an auxiliary point-particle whose
transition amplitudes correspond to the heat-kernel of the operator of quantum
fluctuations of the field theory. However, to study a quantum field which is
confined within some boundaries one needs to restrict the path integration
domain of the auxiliary point-particle to a specific subset of worldlines
enclosed by those boundaries. We show how to implement this restriction for the
case of a scalar field confined to the $D$-dimensional ball under Dirichlet and
Neumann boundary conditions, and compute the first few heat-kernel coefficients
as a verification of our construction. We argue that this approach could admit
different generalizations.

timescales or jet ejections. Rapid optical flaring on time-scales of seconds or
less is incompatible with binary light-travel timescales and has instead been
associated with synchrotron emission from a jet. Both this rapid jet response

brightness is not uniquely determined by the X-ray brightness, but the
X-ray/optical relationship is bounded by a lower-envelope such that at any

lower-envelope traces out a Fopt proportional to Fx^0.54 relation which can be
approximately extrapolated back to quiescence. Rapid optical variability is
only seen near this envelope, and these periods correspond to the hardest hard
X-ray colours. This correlation between hard X-ray colour and optical
variability (and anti-correlation with optical brightness) is a novel finding

call features of both homogeneous and heterogeneous scales omni-scale features.
In this paper, a novel deep ReID CNN is designed, termed Omni-Scale Network

residual block composed of multiple convolutional streams, each detecting
features at a certain scale. Importantly, a novel unified aggregation gate is
introduced to dynamically fuse multi-scale features with input-dependent
channel-wise weights. To efficiently learn spatial-channel correlations and
avoid overfitting, the building block uses pointwise and depthwise
convolutions. By stacking such block layer-by-layer, our OSNet is extremely
lightweight and can be trained from scratch on existing ReID benchmarks.
Despite its small model size, OSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on
six person ReID datasets, outperforming most large-sized models, often by a

amplitudes can be generated in normal metal-superconductor junctions. The
emergence of odd-frequency pairing in these systems is often attributed to the
breaking of translation invariance. In this work, we study the pair symmetry of
a one-dimensional $s$-wave superconductor in the presence of a single
non-magnetic impurity and demonstrate that translation symmetry breaking is not
sufficient for inducing odd-frequency pairing. We consider three kinds of
impurities: a local perturbation of the chemical potential, an impurity
possessing a quantum energy level, and a local perturbation of the
superconducting gap. Surprisingly, we find local perturbations of the chemical
potential do not induce any odd-frequency pairing, despite the fact that they
break translation invariance. Moreover, although odd-frequency can be induced
by both the quantum impurity and the perturbation of the gap, we find these
odd-frequency amplitudes emerge from entirely different kinds of scattering
processes. The quantum impurity generates odd-frequency pairs by allowing one
of the quasiparticles belonging to an equal-time Cooper pair to tunnel onto the
impurity state and then back to the superconductor, giving rise to
odd-frequency amplitudes with a temporal broadening inversely proportional to
the energy level of the impurity. In contrast to this, the perturbation of the
gap leads to odd-frequency pairing by ""gluing-together"" normal state
quasiparticles from different points in space and time, leading to
odd-frequency amplitudes which are very localized in the time domain.

explicitly allow topology changes in time.
  The Voronoi tessellations are obtained from a set of generator points that
move with the local fluid velocity. We employ an AREPO-type approach, which
rapidly rebuilds a new high quality mesh rearranging the element shapes and
neighbors in order to guarantee a robust mesh evolution even for vortex flows
and very long simulation times. The old and new Voronoi elements associated to
the same generator are connected to construct closed space--time control
volumes, whose bottom and top faces may be polygons with a different number of
sides. We also incorporate degenerate space--time sliver elements, needed to
fill the space--time holes that arise because of topology changes. The final
ALE FV-DG scheme is obtained by a redesign of the fully discrete direct ALE
schemes of Boscheri and Dumbser, extended here to moving Voronoi meshes and
space--time sliver elements. Our new numerical scheme is based on the
integration over arbitrary shaped closed space--time control volumes combined
with a fully-discrete space--time conservation formulation of the governing PDE
system. In this way the discrete solution is conservative and satisfies the GCL

translate to QoS violations. Seer combines lightweight distributed RPC-level
tracing, with detailed low-level hardware monitoring to signal an upcoming QoS
violation, and diagnose the source of unpredictable performance. Once an
imminent QoS violation is detected, Seer notifies the cluster manager to take
action to avoid performance degradation altogether. We evaluate Seer both in
local clusters, and in large-scale deployments of end-to-end applications built
with microservices with hundreds of users. We show that Seer correctly
anticipates QoS violations 91% of the time, and avoids the QoS violation to
begin with in 84% of cases. Finally, we show that Seer can identify
application-level design bugs, and provide insights on how to better architect
microservices to achieve predictable performance.

uncertainty about the structure of ISM ices, their ability to store volatiles

the pore surface of porous amorphous solid water (ASW), and quantified the
effective pore surface area of ASW. Additionally, we present results obtained
from a Monte Carlo model of ASW in which the morphology of the ice is directly
visualized and quantified. We found that 200 ML of ASW annealed to 20 K has a
total pore surface area that is equivalent to 46 ML. This surface area
decreases linearly with temperature to about 120 K. We also found that (1)
dangling OH bonds only exist on the surface of pores; (2) almost all of the
pores in the ASW are connected to the vacuum--ice interface, and are accessible
for adsorption of volatiles from the gas phase; there are few closed cavities
inside ASW at least up to a thickness of 200 ML; (3) the total pore surface

cavity shape fluctuation and internal pressure variation in a gust cycle.
Specifically, the cavity centerline shows periodic wavelike undulation with a
maximum amplitude matching that of the incoming flow perturbation. The cavity
internal pressure also fluctuates periodically, causing the corresponding
change of difference between internal and external pressure across the closure
that leads to the closure mode change in a gust cycle. In addition, the
simulation captures the variation of cavity internal flow, particularly the
development internal flow boundary layer along the cavitator mounting strut,
upon the incoming flow perturbation, correlating with cavity deformation and
closure mode variation. With increasing angle of attack, the cavity exhibits
augmented wavelike undulation and pressure fluctuation. As the wavelength of
the flow perturbation approaches the cavity length with increasing gust

pressure fluctuation but reduced cavitation number variation.

discuss the temporal variation of the bulk properties of 22,719 flux ropes

parameters, etc., as functions of the heliographical latitudes and heliocentric
radial distances. We then categorize all identified events into three groups
based on event distributions in different latitudes separated at 30$^{\circ}$,
at different radial distances, and under different solar activities,
respectively. By the detailed statistical analysis, we conclude as follows. (1)
The properties of flux ropes, such as the duration, scale size, etc., follow
the power-law distributions, but with different slope indices, especially for
distributions at different radial distances. (2) Also, they are affected by the
solar wind speed which has different distributions under the different solar
activities, which is manifested as the latitudinal effect. (3) The main
difference in flux rope properties between the low and high latitudes is
attributed to possible Alfv\'enic structures or waves. (4) Flux ropes with
longer duration and larger scale sizes occur more often at larger radial
distances. (5) With more strict Wal\'en slope threshold, more events are

entities and edges represent a relationship across entities. An important area
of research that has emerged over the last decade is the use of graphs as a
vehicle for non-linear dimensionality reduction in a manner akin to previous
efforts based on manifold learning with uses for downstream database
processing, machine learning and visualization. In this systematic yet
comprehensive experimental survey, we benchmark several popular network
representation learning methods operating on two key tasks: link prediction and
node classification. We examine the performance of 12 unsupervised embedding
methods on 15 datasets. To the best of our knowledge, the scale of our study --
both in terms of the number of methods and number of datasets -- is the largest
to date.
  Our results reveal several key insights about work-to-date in this space.
First, we find that certain baseline methods (task-specific heuristics, as well
as classic manifold methods) that have often been dismissed or are not
considered by previous efforts can compete on certain types of datasets if they
are tuned appropriately. Second, we find that recent methods based on matrix
factorization offer a small but relatively consistent advantage over
alternative methods (e.g., random-walk based methods) from a qualitative
standpoint. Specifically, we find that MNMF, a community preserving embedding
method, is the most competitive method for the link prediction task. While
NetMF is the most competitive baseline for node classification. Third, no
single method completely outperforms other embedding methods on both node
classification and link prediction tasks. We also present several drill-down
analysis that reveals settings under which certain algorithms perform well
(e.g., the role of neighborhood context on performance) -- guiding the
end-user.

uncertainties. The uncertainties can come either from sensor limitations such
as occlusions and limited sensor range, or from probabilistic prediction of
other road participants, or from unknown social behavior in a new area. To
safely and efficiently drive in the presence of these uncertainties, the
decision-making and planning modules of autonomous cars should intelligently
utilize all available information and appropriately tackle the uncertainties so
that proper driving strategies can be generated. In this paper, we propose a
social perception scheme which treats all road participants as distributed
sensors in a sensor network. By observing the individual behaviors as well as
the group behaviors, uncertainties of the three types can be updated uniformly
in a belief space. The updated beliefs from the social perception are then
explicitly incorporated into a probabilistic planning framework based on Model
Predictive Control (MPC). The cost function of the MPC is learned via inverse
reinforcement learning (IRL). Such an integrated probabilistic planning module
with socially enhanced perception enables the autonomous vehicles to generate
behaviors which are defensive but not overly conservative, and socially
compatible. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is verified in
simulation on an representative scenario with sensor occlusions.

to generate the best spoofing signals that aim to fool the best trained defense
mechanism. The output of this approach is two-fold. From the attacker point of
view, a deep learning-based spoofing mechanism is trained to potentially fool a
defense mechanism such as RF fingerprinting. From the defender point of view, a
deep learning-based defense mechanism is trained against potential spoofing
attacks when an adversary pair of a transmitter and a receiver cooperates. The
probability that the spoofing signal is misclassified as the intended signal is
measured for random signal, replay, and GAN-based spoofing attacks. Results
show that the GAN-based spoofing attack provides a major increase in the
success probability of wireless signal spoofing even when a deep learning
classifier is used as the defense.

quantum computation and also has applications in quantum communication. Thus it
becomes important to generate contextual sets of arbitrary structure and
complexity to enable a variety of implementations. In recent years, such
generation has been done for contextual sets known as Kochen-Specker sets. Up
to now, two approaches have been used for massive generation of non-isomorphic
Kochen-Specker sets: exhaustive generation up to a given size and downward
generation from master sets and their associated coordinatizations. Master sets
were obtained earlier from serendipitous or intuitive connections with
polytopes or Pauli operators, and more recently from arbitrary vector
components using an algorithm that generates orthogonal vector groupings from
them. However, both upward and downward generation face an inherent exponential
complexity barrier. In contrast, in this paper we present methods and
algorithms that we apply to downward generation that can overcome the
exponential barrier in many cases of interest. These involve tailoring and
manipulating Kochen-Specker master sets obtained from a small number of simple
vector components, filtered by the features of the sets we aim to obtain. Some
of the classes of Kochen-Specker sets we generate contain all previously known
ones, and others are completely novel. We provide examples of both kinds in 4-
and 6-dim Hilbert spaces. We also give a brief introduction for a wider
audience and a novice reader.

(ICN). It enables the rapid distribution of content across the network,
alleviating strain on content producers and reducing content delivery
latencies. ICN has emerged as a promising candidate for use in the Internet of
Things (IoT). However, IoT devices operate under severe constraints, most
notably limited memory. This means that nodes cannot indiscriminately cache all
content; instead, there is a need for a caching strategy that decides what
content to cache. Furthermore, many applications in the IoT space are
timesensitive; therefore, finding a caching strategy that minimises the latency
between content request and delivery is desirable. In this paper, we evaluate a
number of ICN caching strategies in regards to latency and hop count reduction
using IoT devices in a physical testbed. We find that the topology of the
network, and thus the routing algorithm used to generate forwarding
information, has a significant impact on the performance of a given caching
strategy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that focuses on
latency effects in ICN-IoT caching while using real IoT hardware, and the first
to explicitly discuss the link between routing algorithm, network topology, and

where seemingly imperceptible perturbations to the input lead to
misclassifications for otherwise statistically accurate models. We propose a
geometric framework, drawing on tools from the manifold reconstruction
literature, to analyze the high-dimensional geometry of adversarial examples.
In particular, we highlight the importance of codimension: for low-dimensional
data manifolds embedded in high-dimensional space there are many directions off
the manifold in which an adversary could construct adversarial examples.
Adversarial examples are a natural consequence of learning a decision boundary
that classifies the low-dimensional data manifold well, but classifies points
near the manifold incorrectly. Using our geometric framework we prove that
adversarial training is sample inefficient, and show sufficient sampling
conditions under which nearest neighbor classifiers and ball-based adversarial
training are robust. Finally we introduce adversarial training with Voronoi
constraints, which replaces the norm ball constraint with the Voronoi cell for
each point in the training set. We show that adversarial training with Voronoi
constraints produces robust models which significantly improve over the
state-of-the-art on MNIST and are competitive on CIFAR-10.

Moreover, it does not exist any established or standardized method for

fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles in close formation flight to save energy. A
novel cooperative control method is developed. The concept of virtual structure
is employed to resolve the difficulty in designing virtual leaders for a large
number of UAVs in formation flight. To improve the transient performance,
desired trajectories are passed through a group of cooperative filters to
generate smooth reference signals, namely the states of the virtual leaders.
Model uncertainties due to aerodynamic couplings among UAVs are estimated and
compensated using uncertainty and disturbance observers. The entire design,
therefore, contains three major components: cooperative filters for motion
planning, baseline cooperative control, and uncertainty and disturbance
observation. The proposed formation controller could at least secure ultimate
bounded control performance for formation tracking. If certain conditions are
satisfied, asymptotic formation tracking control could be obtained. Major
contributions of this paper lie in two aspects: 1) the difficulty in designing
virtual leaders is resolved in terms of the virtual structure concept; 2) a
robust cooperative controller is proposed for close formation flight of a large
number of UAVs suffering from aerodynamic couplings in between. The efficiency
of the proposed design will be demonstrated using numerical simulations of five
UAVs in close formation flight.

scenarios of multitone sources with unknown frequency and DOA locations and
non-multitone wideband sources with assumed frequency region are examined. In
multitone scenario, sparse solvers yield more accurate DOA-frequency
representation compared to some noncoherent approaches. At the latter scenario,
the proposed method with group sparse solver outperforms some existing wideband
DOA estimators in low SNR regime. In addition, sources' recovery simultaneous

is identified as a long-range ordered antiferromagnet displaying a near-room
temperature transition at $T_N$ = 270~K, accompanied by a low temperature
structural phase transition at $T_S$ = 200~K. The structural phase
transformation at $T_S$ occurs from $R\overline{3}c$ at 300~K to $Pnma$ at
200~K. The density functional theory calculations support an insulating
non-compensated AFM structure. The long-range ordered magnetism of \LFCO\
transforms to short-range glassy magnetism as La is replaced with Sr in the
other two compounds. The magnetism of \LFCO\ is differentiated from the
non-equilibrium glassy features of \SFCO\ and \SLFCO\ using the {\em
cooling-and-heating-in-unequal-fields} (CHUF) magnetization protocols. This
contransting magnetism in the \SLFCOx\ series is evidenced in electron
paramegnetic resonance studies. The electronic density-of-states estimated
using the density functional theory calculations contrast the insulating
feature of \LFCO\ from the metallic nature of \SFCO. From the present suite of
experimental and computational results on \SLFCOx, it emerges that the
electronic degrees of freedom, along with antisite disorder, play an important
role in controlling the magnetism observed in double perovskites.

predict class labels. When the training data contains personal information
about individuals, collecting training data becomes difficult due to privacy
concerns. Local differential privacy is a definition to measure the individual
privacy when there is no trusted data curator. Individuals interact with an
untrusted data aggregator who obtains statistical information about the
population without learning personal data. In order to train a Naive Bayes
classifier in an untrusted setting, we propose to use methods satisfying local
differential privacy. Individuals send their perturbed inputs that keep the
relationship between the feature values and class labels. The data aggregator
estimates all probabilities needed by the Naive Bayes classifier. Then, new
instances can be classified based on the estimated probabilities. We propose
solutions for both discrete and continuous data. In order to eliminate high
amount of noise and decrease communication cost in multi-dimensional data, we
propose utilizing dimensionality reduction techniques which can be applied by
individuals before perturbing their inputs. Our experimental results show that
the accuracy of the Naive Bayes classifier is maintained even when the
individual privacy is guaranteed under local differential privacy, and that
using dimensionality reduction enhances the accuracy.

which allows dense and fast scanning for gigapixel WSI analysis. As a result,
the proposed PFA-ScanNet achieved the state-of-the-art FROC of 90.2% on the

users to upload their data and immediately explore interdisciplinary
connections to other data with similar properties, and be alerted when similar
data is uploaded in the future. In contrast to conventional databases, which
are organized by assigned metadata, CompEngine incentivizes data sharing by
automatically connecting experimental and theoretical scientists across

variations in both X-rays and very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays as it evolved
from a low-flux state on 2010 February 13-15 to a high-flux state on 2010
February 17. During this period, the source exhibited significant spectral
hardening from X-rays to VHE gamma-rays while exhibiting a ""harder when
brighter"" behavior in these energy bands. We reproduce the broadband SED using
a time-dependent multi-zone leptonic jet model with radiation feedback. We find
that an injection of the leptonic particle population with a single power-law
energy distribution at shock fronts followed by energy losses in an
inhomogeneous emission region is suitable for explaining the evolution of Mrk
421 from low- to high-flux state in February 2010. The spectral states are
successfully reproduced by a combination of a few key physical parameters, such
as the maximum $\&$ minimum cutoffs and power-law slope of the electron
injection energies, magnetic field strength, and bulk Lorentz factor of the
emission region. The simulated light curves and spectral evolution of Mrk 421
during this period imply an almost linear correlation between X-ray flux at
1-10 keV energies and VHE gamma-ray flux above 200 GeV, as has been previously
exhibited by this source. Through this study, a general trend that has emerged
for the role of physical parameters is that, as the flare evolves from a low-
to a high-flux state, higher bulk kinetic energy is injected into the system
with a harder particle population and a lower magnetic field strength.

to the variety and complexity of human poses and the inherent ambiguity in
recovering depth from the single view. Recent deep learning based methods show
promising results by using supervised learning on 3d pose annotated datasets.
However, the lack of large-scale 3d annotated training data captured under
in-the-wild settings makes the 3d pose estimation difficult for in-the-wild
poses. Few approaches have utilized training images from both 3d and 2d pose
datasets in a weakly-supervised manner for learning 3d poses in unconstrained
settings. In this paper, we propose a method which can effectively predict 3d
human pose from 2d pose using a deep neural network trained in a
weakly-supervised manner on a combination of ground-truth 3d pose and
ground-truth 2d pose. Our method uses re-projection error minimization as a
constraint to predict the 3d locations of body joints, and this is crucial for
training on data where the 3d ground-truth is not present. Since minimizing
re-projection error alone may not guarantee an accurate 3d pose, we also use
additional geometric constraints on skeleton pose to regularize the pose in 3d.
We demonstrate the superior generalization ability of our method by
cross-dataset validation on a challenging 3d benchmark dataset MPI-INF-3DHP
containing in the wild 3d poses.

image segmentation, and hence, video sequences are currently segmented by
processing each frame of the video sequence separately. The disadvantage of
this is that temporal image information is not considered, which improves the
performance of the segmentation approach. One possibility to include temporal
information is to use recurrent neural networks. However, there are only a few
approaches using recurrent networks for video segmentation so far. These
approaches extend the encoder-decoder network architecture of well-known
segmentation approaches and place convolutional LSTM layers between encoder and
decoder. However, in this paper it is shown that this position is not optimal,
and that other positions in the network exhibit better performance. Nowadays,
state-of-the-art segmentation approaches rarely use the classical
encoder-decoder structure, but use multi-branch architectures. These
architectures are more complex, and hence, it is more difficult to place the
recurrent units at a proper position. In this work, the multi-branch
architectures are extended by convolutional LSTM layers at different positions
and evaluated on two different datasets in order to find the best one. It
turned out that the proposed approach outperforms the pure CNN-based approach
for up to 1.6 percent.

confidence intervals (CIs) that fail to cover their respective parameters to
the total number of constructed CIs. Procedures for FCR control exist in the
offline setting, but none so far have been designed with the online setting in
mind. In the online setting, there is an infinite sequence of fixed unknown
parameters $\theta_t$ ordered by time. At each step, we see independent data
that is informative about $\theta_t$, and must immediately make a decision
whether to report a CI for $\theta_t$ or not. If $\theta_t$ is selected for
coverage, the task is to determine how to construct a CI for $\theta_t$ such
that $\text{FCR} \leq \alpha$ for any $T\in \mathbb{N}$. A straightforward
solution is to construct at each step a $(1-\alpha)$ level conditional CI. In
this paper, we present a novel solution to the problem inspired by online false
discovery rate (FDR) algorithms, which only requires the statistician to be
able to construct a marginal CI at any given level. Apart from the fact that
marginal CIs are usually simpler to construct than conditional ones, the
marginal procedure has an important qualitative advantage over the conditional
solution, namely, it allows selection to be determined by the candidate CI
itself. We take advantage of this to offer solutions to some online problems
which have not been addressed before. For example, we show that our general CI
procedure can be used to devise online sign-classification procedures that
control the false sign rate (FSR). In terms of power and length of the
constructed CIs, we demonstrate that the two approaches have complementary
strengths and weaknesses using simulations. Last, all of our methodology
applies equally well to online FCR control for prediction intervals, having
particular implications for assumption-free selective conformal inference.

forward as a semi-analytical scheme that, for a given microscopic spin model,
allows to discriminate whether the low-temperature states exhibit magnetic
ordering or a tendency towards the formation of quantum spin liquids. However,
the precise nature of the putative spin liquid ground state has remained hard
to infer from the original (single-site) pf-FRG scheme. Here we introduce a
cluster pf-FRG approach, which allows for a more stringent connection between a
microscopic spin model and its low-temperature spin liquid ground states. In
particular, it allows to calculate spatially structured fermion bilinear
expectation values on spatial clusters, which are formed by splitting the
original lattice into several sublattices, thereby allowing for the positive
identification of a family of bilinear spin liquid states. As an application of
this cluster pf-FRG approach, we consider the $J_1$-$J_2$ SU($N$)-Heisenberg
model on a square lattice, which is a paradigmatic example for a frustrated
quantum magnet exhibiting quantum spin liquid behavior for intermediate
coupling strengths. In the well-established large-$N$ limit of this model, we
show that our approach correctly captures the emergence of the $\pi$-flux spin
liquid state at low temperatures. For small $N$, where the precise nature of
the ground state remains controversial, we focus on the widely studied case of
$N=2$, for which we determine the low-temperature phase diagram near the
strongly-frustrated regime after implementing the fermion number constraint by
the flowing Popov-Fedotov method. Our results suggest that the
$J_1$-$J_2$-Heisenberg model does not support the formation of a fermion
bilinear spin liquid state.

an H-shaped non-interacting graphene system locating in the ballistic regime.
Similar to the previous conclusions made from the viscous regime, the numerical
results show that a local-current vortex appears between the nonlocal measuring
terminals, which induces a backflow current and a remarkable negative voltage
drop at the probe. Specifically, the stronger the vortex exhibits, the more
negative $R_{NL}$ manifests. Besides, a spin-orbital coupling is added as an
additional tool to study this exotic vortex, which is not a driving force for
the arising vortex at all. Moreover, a breakdown of the nonlocal
Wiedemann-Franz law is obtained in this ballistic system, and two experimental
criteria are further provided to confirm the existence of this exotic vortex.
Notably, a discussion is made that the vortex actually originates from the
collision between the flowing current and the boundaries, due to the long
electron mean free path and the consequent ballistic transport caused by the
specific linear spectrum of graphene.

In this paper, we focus on a more realistic and challenging case of open set

classes from the source and target domains to be partially overlapped. In this
case, the assumption of conventional distribution alignment does not hold
anymore, due to the different label spaces in two domains. To tackle this

KASE, we first introduce a Known-class Aware Recognition (KAR) module to
identify the known and unknown classes from the target domain, which is
achieved by encouraging a low cross-entropy for known classes and a high
entropy based on the source data from the unknown class. Then, we develop a
Known-class Aware Adaptation (KAA) module to better adapt from the source
domain to the target by reweighing the adaptation loss based on the likeliness
to belong to known classes of unlabeled target samples as predicted by KAR.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

that the strong and mixed strong-electromagnetic sub-amplitudes have the same
phase, the branching ratio of the decay contains an interference term that
depends on the relative phase $\varphi$ between strong and electromagnetic
sub-amplitudes. In this work we calculate this phase, by using an effective
strong Lagrangian density and considering, as final states, pairs of baryons,
$\mathcal{B}\overline{\mathcal{B}}$, belonging to the spin-1/2 SU(3) octet.
Moreover, we obtain the purely strong, purely electromagnetic and mixed
strong-electromagnetic contributions to the total branching ratio and hence the
moduli of the corresponding sub-amplitudes, for each pair of baryons. Of
particular interest is the mixed strong-electromagnetic contribution that, not
only is determined for the first time, but it is proven to be crucial, in the
framework of our model, for the correct description of the decay mechanism.
Finally we use the purely electromagnetic branching ratio to calculate the Born
non-resonant cross section of the annihilation processes $e^+ e^- \to

general idea that irreversibility is a typical property: for the vast majority
of the realizations of the stochastic process, a single trajectory of a
macroscopic observable behaves irreversibly, remaining ""very close"" to the
deterministic evolution of its ensemble average, which can be computed using
probability theory. The validity of the above scenario is checked through
simple numerical simulations and a rigorous proof of the typicality is provided

  Captioning","AAAI 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well believed that video captioning is a fundamental but challenging
task in both computer vision and artificial intelligence fields. The prevalent
approach is to map an input video to a variable-length output sentence in a
sequence to sequence manner via Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Nevertheless,
the training of RNN still suffers to some degree from vanishing/exploding
gradient problem, making the optimization difficult. Moreover, the inherently
recurrent dependency in RNN prevents parallelization within a sequence during
training and therefore limits the computations. In this paper, we present a
novel design --- Temporal Deformable Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Networks
(dubbed as TDConvED) that fully employ convolutions in both encoder and decoder
networks for video captioning. Technically, we exploit convolutional block
structures that compute intermediate states of a fixed number of inputs and
stack several blocks to capture long-term relationships. The structure in
encoder is further equipped with temporal deformable convolution to enable
free-form deformation of temporal sampling. Our model also capitalizes on
temporal attention mechanism for sentence generation. Extensive experiments are
conducted on both MSVD and MSR-VTT video captioning datasets, and superior
results are reported when comparing to conventional RNN-based encoder-decoder
techniques. More remarkably, TDConvED increases CIDEr-D performance from 58.8%
to 67.2% on MSVD.

automatically detect generated domain names in real-time. In this work, we
present a novel DGA called CharBot which is capable of producing large numbers

classifiers on CharBot samples is not a viable defense strategy. We believe
these findings show that DGA classifiers are inherently vulnerable to
adversarial attacks if they rely only on the domain name string to make a
decision. Designing a robust DGA classifier may, therefore, necessitate the use
of additional information besides the domain name alone. To the best of our
knowledge, CharBot is the simplest and most efficient black-box adversarial
attack against DGA classifiers proposed to date.

an horizon, acting as a confining potential. We extend the previous

essential to understand the physical picture. In order to see whether a BEC is
preferred, we use the Brown-York quasilocal energy, finding that a condensate
is energetically favourable in all cases in the classically forbidden region.
The Brown-York quasilocal energy also allows us to derive a quasilocal

star surface to constrain the dense matter equation of state. It is based on
the use of a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm combined with an empirical
parametrization of the equation of state, as well as the consistent treatment
of seven neutron star quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries in globular clusters
with well-measured distances. Previous analyses have indicated that the thermal
emission of these neutron stars tends to prefer low neutron star radii,
questioning basic knowledge from nuclear physics. We show that it is possible
to reconcile the thermal emission analyses with nuclear physics knowledge, with
or without including a prior on the slope of the symmetry energy $L_{\rm sym}$.
We obtain radii of the order of about 12~km without worsening the fit
statistic. With an empirical parametrization of the equation of state, we
obtain the following values for the slope of the symmetry energy, its curvature
$K_{\rm sym}$, and the isoscalar skewness parameter $Q_{\rm sat}$: $L_{\rm
sym}=37.2^{+9.2}_{-8.9}$ MeV, $K_{\rm sym}=-85^{+82}_{-70}$ MeV, and $Q_{\rm
sat}=318^{+673}_{-366}$ MeV. For the first time, we measure the values of the
empirical parameters $K_{\rm sym}$ and $Q_{\rm sat}$. These values are only
weakly impacted by our assumptions, such as the distances or the number of free
empirical parameters, provided they are taken within a reasonable range. We
also study the weak sensitivity of our results to the set of sources analyzed,
and we identify a group of sources that dominates the constraints. The
resulting masses and radii obtained are also discussed in the context of the

mobile edge computing. To resolve system dynamics and uncertainty, in this
paper, an online proactive network association is proposed to minimize average
task delay while considering time-average energy consumption constraints. Under
distributed computing and networking environments, we formulate an
event-triggered proactive network association model by semi-Markov task states
and independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) random events. Then we
facilitate the mobility-aware anticipatory network association to predictively
consider handover effects caused by the mobility. Based on the Markov decision
processes (MDP) and Lyapunov optimization, the two-stage online proactive
network association (TOPNA) decision algorithm is proposed without the
knowledge nor distribution of random events. Simulation results exhibit the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

model. The JDCEV model is an improvement of the reduced form approach, which
unifies credit and equity models into a single framework allowing for
stochastic and possible negative interest rates. From the mathematical point of
view, the valuation involves two partial differential equation (PDE) problems
for each coupon. First, we obtain the existence of solution for these PDE
problems. In order to solve them, we propose appropriate numerical schemes
based on a Crank-Nicolson semi-Lagrangian method for time discretization
combined with bi-quadratic Lagrange finite elements for space discretization.
Once the numerical solutions of the PDEs are obtained, a post-processing
procedure is carried out in order to achieve the value of the bond. This
post-processing includes the computation of an integral term which is
approximated by using the composite trapezoidal rule. Finally, we present some
numerical results for real market bonds issued by different firms in order to
illustrate the proper behaviour of the numerical schemes. Moreover, we obtain
an agreement between the numerical results from the PDE approach and those ones
obtained by applying a Monte Carlo technique and an asymptotic approximation

discuss, in particular, how the forces are related to induced charges and the
electrostatic potential profile (voltage drop) across the junctions. For long
current-carrying junctions we may separate the junction into a part with a
voltage drop, and a part without voltage drop. The latter situation can be
compared to a nano-ribbon in the presence of current using an ideal ballistic
velocity-dependent occupation function. This shows how the combination of

the goal of this work is to develop a meta-model for few-shot learning. The
meta-model, given as input some novel classes with few training examples per
class, must properly adapt the existing recognition model into a new model that
can correctly classify in a unified way both the novel and the base classes. To
accomplish this goal it must learn to output the appropriate classification
weight vectors for those two types of classes. To build our meta-model we make
use of two main innovations: we propose the use of a Denoising Autoencoder
network (DAE) that (during training) takes as input a set of classification
weights corrupted with Gaussian noise and learns to reconstruct the
target-discriminative classification weights. In this case, the injected noise
on the classification weights serves the role of regularizing the weight
generating meta-model. Furthermore, in order to capture the co-dependencies
between different classes in a given task instance of our meta-model, we
propose to implement the DAE model as a Graph Neural Network (GNN). In order to
verify the efficacy of our approach, we extensively evaluate it on ImageNet
based few-shot benchmarks and we report strong results that surpass prior

This choice of distribution allows one to {\it directly} obtain marginal

expansion in the small ratio of the size of the core(s) to the size of the
system. Even in the point-particle limit, neutron halo nuclei have a finite
charge radius, because their center of mass does not coincide with their center
of charge. This point-particle contribution decreases as $1/A_c$, where $A_c$
is the mass number of the core, and diminishes in importance compared to other
effects, e.g., the size of the core to which the neutrons are bound. Here we
propose that for heavy cores the EFT expansion should account for the small
factors of $1/A_c$. As a specific example, we discuss the implications of this
organizational scheme for the inclusion of finite-size effects in expressions
for the charge radii of halo nuclei. We show in particular that a short-range
operator could be the dominant effect in the charge radius of one-neutron halos
bound by a P-wave interaction. The point-particle contribution remains the
leading piece of the charge radius for one-proton halos, and so Halo EFT has
more predictive power in that case.

giant wormlike micelles in mixed nonionic surfactant solutions can be developed
on the basis of a generalized model, which includes the classical phase
separation and mass action models as special cases. The generalized model
describes spherocylindrical micelles, which are simultaneously multicomponent
and polydisperse in size. Theory: The model is based on explicit analytical
expressions for the four components of the free energy of mixed nonionic
micelles: interfacial-tension, headgroup-steric, chain-conformation components
and free energy of mixing. The radii of the cylindrical part and the spherical
endcaps, as well as the chemical composition of the endcaps, are determined by
minimization of the free energy. Findings: In the case of multicomponent
micelles, an additional term appears in the expression for the micelle growth
parameter (scission free energy), which takes into account the fact that the
micelle endcaps and cylindrical part have different compositions. The model
accurately predicts the mean mass aggregation number of wormlike micelles in
mixed nonionic surfactant solutions without using any adjustable parameters.
The endcaps are enriched in the surfactant with smaller packing parameter that
is better accommodated in regions of higher mean surface curvature. The model
can be further extended to mixed solutions of nonionic, ionic and zwitterionic
surfactants used in personal-care and house-hold detergency.

give rise to contraction semigroups. As an application we study
port-Hamiltonian operators on networks whose edges can have finite or infinite
length. In particular, we discuss possibly infinite networks in which the edge
lengths can accumulate zero and port-Hamiltonian operators with Hamiltonians
that neither are bounded nor bounded away from zero. We achieve this, by first
providing a new description for maximal dissipative extensions of
skew-symmetric operators. The main technical tool used for this is the notion
of boundary systems. The latter generalizes the classical notion of boundary
triple(t)s and allows to treat skew-symmetric operators with unequal deficiency
indices. In order to deal with fairly general variable coefficients, we develop
a theory of possibly unbounded, non-negative, injective weights on an abstract
Hilbert space.

significant scientific interest over the past few years, but the problem of
emotion recognition for a group of people has been less extensively studied.
However, it is slowly gaining popularity due to the massive amount of data
available on social networking sites containing images of groups of people
participating in various social events. Group emotion recognition is a
challenging problem due to obstructions like head and body pose variations,
occlusions, variable lighting conditions, variance of actors, varied indoor and
outdoor settings and image quality. The objective of this task is to classify a
group's perceived emotion as Positive, Neutral or Negative. In this report, we
describe our solution which is a hybrid machine learning system that
incorporates deep neural networks and Bayesian classifiers. Deep Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) work from bottom to top, analysing facial expressions
expressed by individual faces extracted from the image. The Bayesian network
works from top to bottom, inferring the global emotion for the image, by
integrating the visual features of the contents of the image obtained through a
scene descriptor. In the final pipeline, the group emotion category predicted
by an ensemble of CNNs in the bottom-up module is passed as input to the
Bayesian Network in the top-down module and an overall prediction for the image
is obtained. Experimental results show that the stated system achieves 65.27%
accuracy on the validation set which is in line with state-of-the-art results.
As an outcome of this project, a Progressive Web Application and an
accompanying Android app with a simple and intuitive user interface are
presented, allowing users to test out the system with their own pictures.

$P[S_1<u]$ to vary regularly as $u\to -\infty$ with exponent $-\beta$, $2\leq

excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions. The locking appears as a

random-access memory (MRAM) as a result of the potential for improved switching
speed and energy-efficiency. It is of particular interest to develop an
SOT-MRAM device with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in order to
leverage the greater density and thermal stability achievable with PMA as
opposed to in-plane magnetic anisotropy. However, the orthogonality between SOT
and PMA prevents deterministic directional switching without an additional
device component that breaks the symmetry, such as an external magnetic field
or complex physical structure; not only do these components complicate
fabrication, they also are not robust to variations in fabrication and applied
switching current. This letter therefore proposes a simple SOT-MRAM structure
with PMA in which deterministic toggle switching is achieved without requiring
additional device components. Furthermore, this toggle PMA SOT-MRAM is shown to
be far more robust than previous approaches for directional PMA SOT-MRAM, with
greater than 50% tolerance to applied switching current magnitude. This letter
describes the physical structure and toggle switching mechanism, provides
micromagnetic simulations demonstrating its feasibility, and evaluates the
robustness and tolerance to material parameters to guide the fabrication of
optimized devices that will jumpstart the third generation of MRAM.

charge equilibration in both IQH and FQH regimes by using a generalized Hall
bar, in which a quantum Hall state is nested in another quantum Hall state with
different Landau filling factors. This provides a feasible way to evaluate
equilibration in various conditions even in the presence of scattering in the

confirming consistency with previous works. In the FQH regime, we find that the
equilibration length for counter-propagating $\delta \nu $ = 1 and $\delta \nu

analytically and by numerical solutions of Maxwell's equations. The match
between the two solutions is impressive. We observe that the interference

cosmological observable that allows us to constrain the dynamical and
geometrical state of our Universe. To measure the correlation function we need
to know both the galaxy positions and the expected galaxy density field. The
expected field is commonly specified using a Monte-Carlo sampling of the volume
covered by the survey and, to minimize additional sampling errors, this random
catalog has to be much larger than the data catalog. Correlation function
estimators compare data-data pair counts to data-random and random-random pair
counts, where random-random pairs usually dominate the computational cost.
Future redshift surveys will deliver spectroscopic catalogs of tens of millions
of galaxies. Given the large number of random objects required to guarantee
sub-percent accuracy, it is of paramount importance to improve the efficiency
of the algorithm without degrading its precision. We show both analytically and
numerically that splitting the random catalog into a number of subcatalogs of
the same size as the data catalog when calculating random-random pairs, and
excluding pairs across different subcatalogs provides the optimal error at
fixed computational cost. For a random catalog fifty times larger than the data

In a chain of free fermions at half filling we consider the evolution of the
ground state of a fully dimerised chain through the homogeneous hamiltonian. We
focus on critical evolution hamiltonians. The temporal evolutions of the gaps
in the entanglement spectrum are analysed. The entanglement hamiltonians in
these models are characterised by matrices that provide also contours for the

Such geometric phases are ubiquitous, and also underline the physics of robust
topological phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect. Equivalently, a
geometric phase may be induced through a cyclic sequence of quantum

renders the closed trajectories, hence the geometric phase, stochastic. We
study the concomitant probability distribution and show that, when varying the

have a low density of 480 $\pm$ 220 kg m-3 and a low permittivity of 1.9 - 2.0,
consistent with a high porosity of 70 - 80 %, are weak with a very low global
tensile strength $<$100 Pa, and have a low bulk thermal inertia of 0 - 60 J K-1
m-2 s-1/2 that allowed them to preserve highly volatiles species (e.g. CO, CO2,
CH4, N2) into their interior since their formation. As revealed by
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the above physical properties vary across the
nucleus, spatially at its surface but also with depth. The broad picture is
that the bulk of the nucleus consists of a weakly bonded, rather homogeneous
material that preserved primordial properties under a thin shell of processed
material, and possibly covered by a granular material; this cover might in
places reach a thickness of several meters. The properties of the top layer
(the first meter) are not representative of that of the bulk nucleus. More
globally, strong nucleus heterogeneities at a scale of a few meters are ruled
out on 67P small lobe.

proof of Chernoff's bound for sums of bounded independent random variables.
Unlike previous methods, their proof is constructive. This means that it
provides an efficient randomized algorithm for the following task: given a set
of Boolean random variables whose sum is not concentrated around its
expectation, find a subset of statistically dependent variables. However, the
algorithm of Impagliazzo and Kabanets (2010) is given only for the Boolean
case. On the other hand, the general proof technique works also for real-valued
random variables, even though for this case, Impagliazzo and Kabanets (2010)
obtain a concentration bound that is slightly suboptimal.
  Herein, we revisit both these issues and show that it is relatively easy to
extend the Impagliazzo-Kabanets algorithm to real-valued random variables and
to improve the corresponding concentration bound by a constant factor.

point-like classical particles in or out of equilibrium. We review its
application to cosmological structure formation. Beginning with the
construction of the generating functional of the theory, we describe in detail
how the theory needs to be adapted to reflect the expanding spatial background
and the homogeneous and isotropic, correlated initial conditions for cosmic
structures. Based on the generating functional, we develop three main
approaches to non-linear, late-time cosmic structures, which rest either on the
Taylor expansion of an interaction operator, suitable averaging procedures for
the interaction term, or a resummation of perturbation terms. We show how an
analytic, parameter-free equation for the non-linear cosmic power spectrum can
be derived.
  We explain how the theory can be used to derive the density profile of
gravitationally bound structures and use it to derive power spectra of cosmic
velocity densities. We further clarify how KFT relates to the BBGKY hierarchy.
We then proceed to apply kinetic field theory to fluids, introduce a
reformulation of KFT in terms of macroscopic quantities which leads to a
resummation scheme, and use this to describe mixtures of gas and dark matter.
We discuss how KFT can be applied to study cosmic structure formation with
modified theories of gravity. As an example for an application to a
non-cosmological particle ensemble, we show results on the spatial correlation
function of cold Rydberg atoms derived from KFT.

we use an information-theoretical approach to investigate activity propagation

optimized pairwise information propagation emerges due to the increase of
either (i) the global synaptic strength parameter or (ii) the number of modules
in the network, while the network size remains constant. At the population
level, information propagation of activity among adjacent modules is enhanced
as the number of modules increases until a maximum value is reached and then
decreases, showing that there is an optimal interplay between synaptic strength
and modularity for population information flow. This is in contrast to
information propagation evaluated among pairs of neurons, which attains maximum
value at the maximum values of these two parameter ranges. By examining the
network behavior under increase of synaptic strength and number of modules we
find that these increases are associated with two different effects: (i)
increase of autocorrelations among individual neurons, and (ii) increase of
cross-correlations among pairs of neurons. The second effect is associated with
better information propagation in the network. Our results suggest roles that
link topological features and synaptic strength levels to the transmission of

behaviour of the non-thermal afterglow led to a debate about its nature, which
was eventually settled by high-resolution VLBI observations, which strongly
support the off-axis structured jet scenario. Using information on the jet
structure derived from multi-wavelength fitting of the afterglow emission and
of the apparent VLBI image centroid motion, we compute the appearance of a GRB

We find that the intrinsic properties of the GRB 170817A jet are representative
of a typical event in the SGRB population, hinting at a quasi-universal jet
structure. The diversity in the SGRB afterglow population could therefore be
ascribed in large part to extrinsic (redshift, density of the surrounding
medium, viewing angle) rather than intrinsic properties. Although more
uncertain, the comparison can be extended to the prompt emission properties,

for dark matter annihilations and decays in the Milky Way, due to the low
astrophysical background expected. To estimate both the signal for various dark
matter models and the astrophysical background, one employs usually the
coalescence model in a Monte Carlo framework. This allows one to treat the
production of antinuclei on an event-by-event basis, taking thereby into
account momentum correlations between the antinucleons involved in the process.
This approach lacks however an underlying microscopic picture, and the
numerical value of the coalescence parameter obtained from fits to different
reactions varies considerably. Here we propose instead to combine
event-by-event Monte Carlo simulations with a microscopic coalescence picture
based on the Wigner function representations of the produced antinuclei states.
This approach allows us to include in a semi-classical picture both the size of
the formation region, which is process dependent, and momentum correlations.
The model contains a single, universal parameter which is fixed by fitting the
production spectra of antideuterons in proton-proton interactions, measured at
the Large Hadron Collider. Using this value, the model describes well the

the method to the globular cluster M68 and detect its clear tidal stream
stretching over the whole North Galactic hemisphere, and passing within 5 kpc
of the Sun. This is one of the closest tidal streams to us detected so far, and
is highly promising to provide new constraints on the Milky Way gravitational
potential, for which we present preliminary fits finding a slightly oblate dark
halo consistent with other observations. We identify the M68 tidal stream with
the previously discovered Fj\""orm stream by Ibata et al. The tidal stream is
confirmed to contain stars that are consistent with the HR-diagram of M68. We

sparse Bayesian learning is only available to problems with a direct sparsity

developing a flawless and well-organized concurrent program is difficult.
Software Transactional Memory Systems (STMs) are a convenient programming
interface which assist the programmer to access the shared memory concurrently
without worrying about consistency issues such as priority-inversion, deadlock,
livelock, etc. Another important feature that STMs facilitate is
compositionality of concurrent programs with great ease. It composes different
concurrent operations in a single atomic unit by encapsulating them in a
transaction. Many STMs available in the literature execute read/write primitive
operations on memory buffers. We represent them as Read-Write STMs or RWSTMs.
Whereas, there exist some STMs (transactional boosting and its variants) which
work on higher level operations such as insert, delete, lookup, etc. on a
hash-table. We refer these STMs as Object Based STMs or OSTMs. The literature
of databases and RWSTMs say that maintaining multiple versions ensures greater
concurrency. This motivates us to maintain multiple version at higher level
with object semantics and achieves greater concurrency. So, this paper
pro-poses the notion of Optimized Multi-version Object Based STMs or
OPT-MVOSTMs which encapsulates the idea of multiple versions in OSTMs to
harness the greater concurrency efficiently.

and the dynamically orthogonal (DO) and bi-orthogonal (BO) methods for
representing stochastic processes. Specifically, we propose two new
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving time-dependent SPDEs,
namely the NN-DO/BO methods, which incorporate the DO/BO constraints into the
loss function with an implicit form instead of generating explicit expressions
for the temporal derivatives of the DO/BO modes. Hence, the proposed methods
overcome some of the drawbacks of the original DO/BO methods: we do not need
the assumption that the covariance matrix of the random coefficients is
invertible as in the original DO method, and we can remove the assumption of no
eigenvalue crossing as in the original BO method. Moreover, the NN-DO/BO
methods can be used to solve time-dependent stochastic inverse problems with
the same formulation and computational complexity as for forward problems. We
demonstrate the capability of the proposed methods via several numerical
examples: (1) A linear stochastic advection equation with deterministic initial
condition where the original DO/BO method would fail; (2) Long-time integration
of the stochastic Burgers' equation with many eigenvalue crossings during the
whole time evolution where the original BO method fails. (3) Nonlinear reaction
diffusion equation: we consider both the forward and the inverse problem,
including noisy initial data, to investigate the flexibility of the NN-DO/BO
methods in handling inverse and mixed type problems. Taken together, these
simulation results demonstrate that the NN-DO/BO methods can be employed to
effectively quantify uncertainty propagation in a wide range of physical

investigated. First, a collision model is considered, in which the packet is
replicated onto $K$ available resources, $K' \leq K$ of which are received
without collision, and treated as diversity branches by a maximum-ratio
combining (MRC) receiver. The resulting diversity degree $K'$ depends on the
arrival process and coding strategy. In the second model, the slots subject to
collisions are also used for MRC, such that the number of diversity branches
$K$ is constant, but the resulting combined signal is affected by multiple

Matlab is more convenient in developing and data presentation, OpenCV is much

and varied applications. While there has been theoretical work on this problem,
showing both linear conditional lower bounds for the fully dynamic problem and
insertions-only and deletions-only upper bounds beating these conditional lower

approaches to obtain and maintain reachability information with respect to a
distinguished source. Moreover, we extend the existing insertions-only or
deletions-only upper bounds into fully dynamic algorithms. Even though the
worst-case time per operation of all the fully dynamic algorithms we evaluate

sound potentially makes nearby habitat unsuitable for acoustically

individual species as well as subsequent effects on the surrounding landscape.
We seek to characterize the relationship between anthropogenic and biological
sounds in western New York and assess the extent to which available traffic
data explains variability in anthropogenic noise. Recordings were obtained in
the spring of 2016 at 18 sites throughout western New York. We used the Welch
Power Spectral Density (PSD) at low frequencies (0.5-2 kHz) to represent
anthropogenic noise and PSD values at higher frequencies (2-11 kHz) to
represent biological sound. Relationships were modeled using a novel two-stage
hierarchical Bayesian model utilizing beta regression and basis splines. Model
results and map predictions illustrate that anthropogenic noise and biological
sound have an inverse relationship, and anthropogenic noise is greatest in
close proximity to high traffic volume roads. The predictions have large
uncertainty, resulting from the temporal coarseness of public road data used as
a proxy for traffic sound. Results suggest that finer temporal resolution
traffic sound data, such as crowd-sourced time-indexed traffic data from
geographic positioning systems, might better account for observed temporal
changes in the soundscape. The use of such data, in combination with the
proposed modeling framework, could have important implications for the
development of sound management policies.

causes inefficiency in the training process. The model synchronization is
directly affected by the mini-batch size of data processed before the global

time in training model synchronization has to be as minimum as possible while
retaining a high testing accuracy. The effect from model synchronization
frequency over the convergence of the algorithm and accuracy of the generated

research, we identify the bottlenecks in model synchronization in parallel
stochastic gradient descent (PSGD)-based SVM algorithm with respect to the

optimizing the MSF in the data sets that we used, a reduction of 98\% in
communication time can be gained (16x - 24x speed up) with respect to
high-frequency model synchronization. The training model optimization discussed
in this paper guarantees a higher accuracy than the sequential algorithm along

economic systems arising in modeling optimal investment with \textit{vintage
capital}, namely, systems where all key variables (capitals, investments,
prices) are indexed not only by time $\tau$ but also by age $s$. Capital
accumulation is hence described as a partial differential equation (briefly,
PDE), and equilibrium points are in fact equilibrium distributions in the
variable $s$ of ages. Investments in frontier as well as non-frontier vintages
are possible. Firstly a general method is developed to compute and study
equilibrium points of a wide range of infinite dimensional, infinite horizon
boundary control problems for linear PDEs with convex criterion, possibly
applying to a wide variety of economic problems. Sufficient and necessary
conditions for existence of equilibrium points are derived in this general
context. In particular, for optimal investment with vintage capital, existence
and uniqueness of a long run equilibrium distribution is proved for general
concave revenues and convex investment costs, and analytic formulas are
obtained for optimal controls and trajectories in the long run, definitely
showing how effective the theoretical machinery of optimal control in infinite
dimension is in computing explicitly equilibrium distributions, and suggesting
that the same method can be applied in examples yielding the same abstract
structure. To this extent, the results of this work constitutes a first crucial
step towards a thorough understanding of the behavior of optimal controls and
trajectories in the long run.

final time observation for homogeneous parabolic problems. It is well-known
that such problems are exponentially ill-posed due to the strong smoothing
property of parabolic equations. We are interested in a situation when the
initial data we intend to recover is known to be sparse, i.e. its support has
Lebesgue measure zero. We formulate the problem as an optimal control problem
and incorporate the information on the sparsity of the unknown initial data
into the structure of the objective functional. In particular, we are looking
for the control variable in the space of regular Borel measures and use the
corresponding norm as a regularization term in the objective functional. This
leads to a convex but non-smooth optimization problem. For the discretization
we use continuous piecewise linear finite elements in space and discontinuous
Galerkin finite elements of arbitrary degree in time. For the general case we
establish error estimates for the state variable. Under a certain structural
assumption, we show that the control variable consists of a finite linear
combination of Dirac measures. For this case we obtain error estimates for the
locations of Dirac measures as well as for the corresponding coefficients. The
key to the numerical analysis are the sharp smoothing type pointwise finite
element error estimates for homogeneous parabolic problems, which are of
independent interest. Moreover, we discuss an efficient algorithmic approach to
the problem and show several numerical experiments illustrating our theoretical
results.

renormalization group calculation at one loop, we show that the violation of
momentum conservation generates a crossover between a conservative yet
IR-unstable fixed point, characterized by a dynamic critical exponent $z=d/2$,
and a dissipative IR-stable fixed point with $z=2$. Interestingly, the two
fixed points have different upper critical dimensions. The interplay between
these two fixed points gives rise to a crossover in the critical dynamics of
the system, characterized by a crossover exponent $\kappa=4/d$. Such crossover
is regulated by a conservation length scale, $\mathcal R_0$, which is larger
the smaller the dissipation: beyond $\mathcal R_0$ the dissipative fixed point
dominates, while at shorter distances dynamics is ruled by the conservative
fixed point and critical exponent, a behaviour which is all the more relevant
in finite-size systems with weak dissipation. We run numerical simulations in
three dimensions and find a crossover between the exponents $z=3/2$ and $z=2$
in the critical slowing down of the system, confirming the renormalization
group results. From the biophysical point of view, our calculation indicates
that in finite-size biological groups mode-coupling terms in the equation of
motion can significantly change the dynamical critical exponents even in the
presence of dissipation, a step towards reconciling theory with experiments in
natural swarms. Moreover, our result provides the scale within which fully

than the peak value, and should be calculated from the time-independent
component of the density contrast in the super-horizon limit (long before
perturbations enter the horizon) rather than at horizon crossing. For the first
time the effect of the choice of smoothing function upon the formation
criterion is calculated, and, for a given abundance of PBHs, it is found that
the uncertainty in the amplitude of the power spectrum due to this is
$\mathcal{O}(10\%)$, an order of magnitude smaller than previous calculations
suggest. The relation between the formation criterion stated in terms of the
density contrast and the curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$ is also
discussed.

the parties to learn the output of function $f$ of their private inputs, while
leaking nothing more. In a sense, such a protocol realizes a trusted oracle
that computes $f$ and returns the result to both parties. There have been
tremendous strides in efficiency over the past ten years, yet 2P-SFE protocols
remain impractical for most real-time, online computations, particularly on
modestly provisioned devices. Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) provides
hardware-protected execution environments, called enclaves, that may be viewed
as trusted computation oracles. While SGX provides native CPU speed for secure
computation, previous side-channel and micro-architecture attacks have
demonstrated how security guarantees of enclaves can be compromised.
  In this paper, we explore a balanced approach to 2P-SFE on SGX-enabled
processors by constructing a protocol for evaluating $f$ relative to a
partitioning of $f$. This approach alleviates the burden of trust on the
enclave by allowing the protocol designer to choose which components should be
evaluated within the enclave, and which via standard cryptographic techniques.
We describe SGX-enabled SFE protocols (modeling the enclave as an oracle), and
formalize the strongest-possible notion of 2P-SFE for our setting. We prove our
protocol meets this notion when properly realized. We implement the protocol
and apply it to two practical problems: privacy-preserving queries to a
database, and a version of Dijkstra's algorithm for privacy-preserving
navigation. Our evaluation shows that our SGX-enabled SFE scheme enjoys a 38x
increase in performance over garbled-circuit-based SFE. Finally, we justify
modeling of the enclave as an oracle by implementing protections against known
side-channels.

speedup models but none have considered the limiting effect of the memory wall.
These models exploited aspects such as problem-size variation, memory size,
communication overhead, and synchronization overhead, but data-access delays
are assumed to be constant. Nevertheless, such delays can vary, for example,
according to the number of cores used and the ratio between processor and
memory frequencies. Given the large number of possible configurations of
operating frequency and number of cores that current architectures can offer,
suitable speedup models to describe such variations among these configurations
are quite desirable for off-line or on-line scheduling decisions. This work
proposes new parallel speedup models that account for variations of the average
data-access delay to describe the limiting effect of the memory wall on
parallel speedups. Analytical results indicate that the proposed modeling can
capture the desired behavior while experimental hardware results validate the
former. Additionally, we show that when accounting for parameters that reflect
the intrinsic characteristics of the applications, such as degree of
parallelism and susceptibility to the memory wall, our proposal has significant
advantages over machine-learning-based modeling. Moreover, besides being
black-box modeling, our experiments show that conventional machine-learning
modeling needs about one order of magnitude more measurements to reach the same
level of accuracy achieved in our modeling.

this principle and scale two popular self-supervised approaches to 100 million

problem 'hardness'), one can largely match or even exceed the performance of
supervised pre-training on a variety of tasks such as object detection, surface

Scaling these methods also provides many interesting insights into the
limitations of current self-supervised techniques and evaluations. We conclude
that current self-supervised methods are not 'hard' enough to take full

in the microlensing event MOA-bin-29 that occurred in 2006. We find five
degenerate solutions with the planet/host-star mass ratio of $q \sim 10^{-2}$.
The Einstein radius crossing time of all models are relatively short ($\sim
4-7$ days), which indicates that the mass of host star is likely low. The
measured lens-source proper motion is $5-9$ ${\rm mas}\ {\rm yr}^{-1}$

conduct a Bayesian analysis in order to obtain the posterior probability

M-dwarf in the Galactic bulge. The probability distributions of the physical
parameters for the five degenerate models are consistent within the range of

relevant quantities such as Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) has become
increasingly widespread in recent years. Many researchers, however, claim that
emergent constraints are inappropriate or even under-report uncertainty. In
this paper we contribute to this discussion by examining the emergent
constraints methodology in terms of its underpinning statistical assumptions.
We argue that the existing frameworks are based on indefensible assumptions,
then show how weakening them leads to a more transparent Bayesian framework
wherein hitherto ignored sources of uncertainty, such as how reality might
differ from models, can be quantified. We present a guided framework for the
quantification of additional uncertainties that is linked to the confidence we
can have in the underpinning physical arguments for using linear constraints.
We provide a software tool for implementing our general framework for emergent
constraints and use it to illustrate the framework on a number of recent
emergent constraints for ECS. We find that the robustness of any constraint to
additional uncertainties depends strongly on the confidence we can have in the
underpinning physics, allowing a future framing of the debate over the validity
of a particular constraint around the underlying physical arguments, rather

studied: 1) most of them fail to well preserve the semantic correlations in
hash codes because of the large heterogenous gap; 2) most of them relax the
discrete constraint on hash codes, leading to large quantization error and
consequent low performance; 3) most of them suffer from relatively high memory
cost and computational complexity during training procedure, which makes them
unscalable. In this paper, to address above issues, we propose a supervised
cross-modal hashing method based on matrix factorization dubbed Efficient
Discrete Supervised Hashing (EDSH). Specifically, collective matrix
factorization on heterogenous features and semantic embedding with class labels
are seamlessly integrated to learn hash codes. Therefore, the feature based
similarities and semantic correlations can be both preserved in hash codes,
which makes the learned hash codes more discriminative. Then an efficient
discrete optimal algorithm is proposed to handle the scalable issue. Instead of
learning hash codes bit-by-bit, hash codes matrix can be obtained directly
which is more efficient. Extensive experimental results on three public

stabilized by imposing an additional discrete global symmetry $S^{'}$ with
charges, such that it satisfies $S=S^{'}+T_{3N}$ even when $SU(2)_N$ is
completely broken. This model, apart from a single-component DM also offers a
two-component DM augmented by a scalar and a vector boson, which lives over a
large parameter space evading strong direct search bounds. Apart from potential
DM candidates, this model also explains the smallness of neutrino masses
through the $inverse$ $seesaw$ $mechanism$. We have computed tree-unitarity
bound to limit the scalar mass spectrum in our model. Phenomenological aspects
of the model have been discussed. Further, we have analyzed the possible
collider signatures at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and its future
implications.

collectively enhanced and scales with $g_{\text{eff}}\propto\sqrt{2L}$, where

combinational circuits along with memory; these systems are known as sequential
circuits. Sequential circuits are of two types: synchronous and asynchronous.
In a synchronous sequential circuit, a clock signal is used at discrete
instants of time to synchronize desired operations. Asynchronous sequential
circuits do not require synchronizing clock pulses; however, the completion of

logic design steps are generally identical for sequential and combinational
circuits; these are specification, formulation, optimization, and the
implementation of the optimized equations using a suitable hardware technology.
The differences between sequential and combinational design steps appear in the
details of each step. The minimization (optimization) techniques used in logic
design range from simple (manual) to complex (automated). An example of manual
optimization methods is the Karnough map (K-map). Indeed, hardware
implementation technology has been growing faster than the ability of designers
to produce hardware designs. Hence, there has been a growing interest in
developing techniques and tools that facilitate the process of logic design.

Robots (CFMMR) is studied in this paper. This type of wheeled mobile robot uses
rigid axles coupled by compliant frame modules to provide both full suspension
and enhanced steering capability without additional hardware. The proposed
control system is developed by combining a bounded curvature-based kinematic
controller and a nonlinear damping dynamic controller. In particular, multiple
forms of controller interaction are examined. A twoaxle scout CFMMR
configuration is used to evaluate the different control structures.
Experimental results verify efficient motion control of posture regulation.

combing the Rao-Blackwellized particle filter and Unscented Kalman filte(UKF).
The landmarks are detected by a binocular vision to integrate localization and
mapping. Since such binocular vision system generally inherits larger
measurement errors, it is suitable to adopt Unscented FastSLAM to improve the
performance of localization and mapping. Unscented FastSLAM takes advantage of
UKF instead of the linear approximations of the nonlinear function where the
effective number of particles is used as the criteria to reduce the particle
degeneration. Simulations and experiments are carried out to demonstrate that
the Unscented FastSLAM algorithm can achieve much better performance in the
vision-based system than FastSLAM2.0 algorithm on the accuracy and robustness.

assistance is proposed in this paper to allow a robot to identify its location
and build a global map in an outdoor environment. The Iterative Closest Points
(ICP) algorithm and terrain inclination-based localization are combined
together to achieve accurate and fast localization and mapping. Inclinations of
the terrains the robot navigates are used to achieve local localization during
the interval between two laser scans. Using the results of the above
localization as the initial condition, the ICP algorithm is then applied to
align the overlapped laser scan maps to update the overhanging obstacles for
building a global map of the surrounding area. Comprehensive experiments were
carried out for the validation of the proposed 3D localization and mapping
technique. The experimental results show that the proposed technique could
reduce time consumption and improve the accuracy of the performance.

  Disturbance for a Small-Scale Unmanned Helicopter",,,,,"cs.SY cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a novel method to attenuate large horizontal wind
disturbance for a small-scale unmanned autonomous helicopter combining wind
tunnel-based experimental data and a backstepping algorithm. Large horizontal
wind disturbance is harmful to autonomous helicopters, especially to small ones
because of their low inertia and the high cross-coupling effects among the
multiple inputs. In order to achieve more accurate and faster attenuation of
large wind disturbance, a new hybrid control architecture is proposed to take
advantage of the direct force/moment compensation based on the wind tunnel
experimental data. In this architecture, large horizontal wind disturbance is
treated as an additional input to the control system instead of a small
perturbation around the equilibrium state. A backstepping algorithm is then
designed to guarantee the stable convergence of the hilicopter to the desired
position. The proposed technique is finally evaluated in simulation on the
platform, HIROBO Eagle, compared with a traditional wind velocity compensation
method.

  An agent-based model of E-cigarette and Cigarette Interaction","10 pages, SBP-BRiMS 2019",,,,"q-bio.OT stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite a general reduction in smoking in many areas of the developed world,
it remains one of the biggest public health threats. As an alternative to
tobacco, the use of electronic cigarettes (ECig) has been increased
dramatically over the last decade. ECig use is hypothesized to impact smoking
behavior through several pathways, not only as a means of quitting cigarettes
and lowering risk of relapse, but also as both an alternative nicotine delivery
device to cigarettes, as a visible use of nicotine that can lead to imitative
behavior in the form of smoking, and as a gateway nicotine delivery technology
that can build high levels of nicotine tolerance and pave the way for
initiation of smoking. Evidence regarding the effect of ECig use on smoking
behavior change remains inconclusive. To address these challenges, we built an
agent-based model (ABM) of smoking and ECig use to examine the effects of ECig
use on smoking behavior change. The impact of social network (SN) on the
initiation of smoking and ECig use were also explored. Findings from the
simulation suggest that the use of ECig generates substantially lower
prevalence of current smoker (PCS), which demonstrates the potential for
reducing smoking and lowering the risk of relapse. The effects of
proximity-based influences within SN increases the prevalence of current ECig
user (PCEU). The model also suggests the importance of improved understanding
of drivers in cessation and relapse in ECig use, in light of findings that such
aspects of behavior change may notably influence smoking behavior change and
burden.

image feature extraction. The nearest feature line (NFL) is a powerful
classifier. Some NFL-based subspace algorithms were introduced recently. In
most of the classical NFL-based subspace learning approaches, the input samples
are vectors. For image classification tasks, the image samples should be
transformed to vectors first. This process induces a high computational
complexity and may also lead to loss of the geometric feature of samples. The
proposed BDFLA is a matrix-based algorithm. It aims to minimise the
within-class scatter and maximise the between-class scatter based on a
two-dimensional (2D) NFL. Experimental results on two-image databases confirm
the effectiveness.

change that allows quantum mechanics to be interpreted as quantum geometry. The
Bohr model of the Hydrogen atom is thought of in terms of an indeterministic
electron position and a deterministic metric and the motivation for this paper
is to try to change variables to have a deterministic position and momentum for
the electron and nucleus but with an indeterministic (quantum) metric that
reproduces the physics of the Bohr model. This mapping is achieved by allowing
the metric in the Hamiltonian to be different to the metric in the space-time
distance element and then representing the two metrics with vierbeins and
assuming they are canonically conjugate variables. Effectively, the usual
Schr\""odinger space-time variables have been re-interpreted as four of the
potentially sixteen parameters of the metric tensor vierbein in the distance
element while the metric tensor vierbein in the Hamiltonian is an operator
expressible as first-order derivatives in these variables or vice versa. I then
argue that this reproduces observed quantum physics at the sub-atomic level by
demonstrating the energy spectrum of electron orbitals is exactly the same as
the usual relativistic Bohr model for the Hydrogen atom in a certain limit.
Next, by introducing a single dimensionless running coupling that shows up in
the analogous place as, but in addition to, Planck's constant in the commutator
definition I argue that this allows massive objects to couple to the physical
space-time geometry but not massless ones - no matter coupling value. This
claim is based on a fit to the Schwarzschild metric with a few simple
assumptions and thus obtaining an effective theory of how the quantum
geometries at nearby space-time points couple to one another. This demonstrates
that this coupling constant is related to Newton's gravitational constant.

Since device drivers are considered the most important parts affecting the
