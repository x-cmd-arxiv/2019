nanoparticles have received considerable attention for their applications in
superconductivity, visible light emission, quantum dot devices and industrial
catalysts. The QSE properties of semiconductor AgBr nanoparticles have been
thoroughly characterized for cluster larger than three nanometers in diameter,
the QSE studies of clusters in the quantum size regime less than 3nm have been
historically difficult to describe owing to weak optical absorption and
challenge in keep cluster in small size range against self aggregation. Such
difficulties have precluded probing the properties of these small clusters in
many natural and engineered processes. Our previous investigation of silver
bromide ionic clusters that prepared via the electroporation of vesicles using
direct laser desorption -- time of flight -- mass spectrometry (DLD-TOF-MS) had
successfully revealed relation ship between cluster structure and the UV
absorption band shift. The turn-around point had been experimentally identified
to be $ (Ag_3Br_2)^+ $, which is close to the theoretical prediction. Despite
those successes, there a lot of questions not be answered. These unanswered
questions include why DLD-TOF-MS spectra show an unsymmetrical cluster finger
peaks? why the large clusters have much lower DLD-TOF-MS spectra intensity? Why
the cluster UV absorption have such wide band and it takes so long time to
observe the band shift? In this paper, we reexamine our previous theoretical
work and systematically answer the above questions with symmetry and
probability principles in molecular cluster growth range. We also discussed the
isotopic properties of silver bromide clusters and their possible applications
on the dark matter detection based on recent findings that isotopic atoms can
decay while interact with dark matters.

correlations are determined by strong quantum fluctuations. While an
overarching principle specifying the precise microscopic coupling scenarios for
which quantum spin-liquid behavior arises is unknown, it is well-established
that they are preferably found in spin systems where the corresponding
classical limit of spin magnitudes $S\rightarrow\infty$ exhibits a macroscopic
ground state degeneracy, so-called classical spin liquids. Spiral spin liquids
represent a special family of classical spin liquids where degenerate manifolds
of spin spirals form closed contours or surfaces in momentum space. Here, we
investigate the potential of spiral spin liquids to evoke quantum spin-liquid
behavior when the spin magnitude is tuned from the classical
$S\rightarrow\infty$ limit to the quantum $S=1/2$ case. To this end, we first
use the Luttinger-Tisza method to formulate a general scheme which allows one
to construct new spiral spin liquids based on bipartite lattices. We apply this
approach to the two-dimensional square lattice and the three-dimensional hcp
lattice to design classical spiral spin-liquid phases which have not been
previously studied. By employing the pseudofermion functional renormalization
group (PFFRG) technique we investigate the effects of quantum fluctuations when
the classical spins are replaced by quantum $S=1/2$ spins. We indeed find that
extended spiral spin-liquid regimes change into paramagnetic quantum phases
possibly realizing quantum spin liquids. Remnants of the degenerate spiral
surfaces are still discernible in the momentum-resolved susceptibility, even in
the quantum $S=1/2$ case. In total, this corroborates the potential of
classical spiral spin liquids to induce more complex non-magnetic quantum
phases.

that in the presence of symmetry-allowed, second-neighbor Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interactions these spin liquids give rise to a finite, non-quantized, thermal
Hall conductance in a magnetic field. The microscopic origin of this thermal
Hall effect can be traced back to an interplay of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya

that twists the motion of the emergent spinons. We argue that such a
non-quantized thermal Hall effect is a generic response in Kitaev models for a
range of couplings.

mechanisms which break these two barriers, i.e., mechanisms which incorporate
negative valuation and asymmetric belief, independently. For negative
valuation, we present a methodology for converting existing mechanisms to
mechanisms that incorporate agents with negative valuations. Particularly, we
adapt existing PPR and PPS mechanisms, to present novel PPRN and PPSN
mechanisms which incentivize strategic agents to contribute to the project
based on their true preference. With respect to asymmetric belief, we propose a
reward scheme Belief Based Reward (BBR) based on Robust Bayesian Truth Serum
mechanism. With BBR, we propose a general mechanism for civic crowdfunding

CMEs remain observationally unexplored. Using time-resolved high-resolution
X-ray spectroscopy of a stellar flare on the active star HR 9024 observed with
Chandra/HETGS, we distinctly detected Doppler shifts in S XVI, Si XIV, and Mg
XII lines that indicate upward and downward motions of hot plasmas (~10-25 MK)
within the flaring loop, with velocity v~100-400 km/s, in agreement with a
model of flaring magnetic tube. Most notably, we also detected a later
blueshift in the O VIII line which reveals an upward motion, with v=90+/-30
km/s, of cool plasma (~4 MK), that we ascribe to a CME coupled to the flare.
From this evidence we were able to derive a CME mass of 1x10^21 g and a CME
kinetic energy of 5x10^34 erg. These values provide clues in the extrapolation
of the solar case to higher activity levels, suggesting that CMEs could indeed
be a major cause of mass and angular momentum loss.

numerical simulations of collapsing cloud cores, but its effect on the
evolution of the entire disk can be significant. We use numerical hydrodynamics
simulations to model the long-term evolution of self-gravitating and viscous
circumstellar disks in the thin-disk limit. Simulations start from the
gravitational collapse of prestellar cores of 0.5--1.0~$M_\odot$ and both
gaseous and dusty subsystems were considered, including a model for dust
growth. The inner unresolved 1.0 au of the disk is replaced with a central
""smart"" cell (CSC) -- a simplified model that simulates physical processes that
may occur in this region. We found that the mass transport rate through the CSC
has an appreciable effect on the evolution of the entire disk. Models with slow
mass transport form more massive and warmer disks and they are more susceptible
to gravitational instability and fragmentation, including a newly identified
episodic mode of disk fragmentation in the T Tauri phase of disk evolution.
Models with slow mass transport through the CSC feature episodic accretion and
luminosity bursts in the early evolution, while models with fast transport are
characterized by a steadily declining accretion rate with low-amplitude
flickering. Dust grows to a larger, decimeter size in the slow transport models
and efficiently drifts in the CSC, where it accumulates reaching the limit when
streaming instability becomes operational. We argue that gravitational
instability, together with streaming instability likely operating in the inner
disk regions, constitute two concurrent planet-forming mechanisms, which may
explain the observed diversity of exoplanetary orbits (Abridged).

BdHNe comprise two subclasses of long GRBs with progenitors a binary system
composed of a carbon-oxygen star (CO$_\textrm{core}$) and a neutron star (NS)

manifestation of an underlying, slowly-varying, long-wavelength, baroclinic
flow in a two-layer, density-stratified system. The results of our model show
numerically that, under strong nonlinearity, surface waves, with their typical
wavenumber being the resonant $k_{\mathrm{res}}$, can be generated locally at
the leading edge of the underlying slowly-varying, long-wavelength baroclinic
flow. Here, the resonant $k_{\mathrm{res}}$ satisfies the class 3 triad
resonance condition among two short-mode waves and one long-mode wave in which
all waves propagate in the same direction. Moreover, when the slope of the
baroclinic flow is sufficiently small, only one spatially-localized
large-amplitude surface wave packet can be generated at the leading edge. This
localized surface wave packet becomes high in amplitude and large in group
velocity after the interaction with its surrounding waves. These results are
qualitatively consistent with various experimental observations including
resonant surface waves at the leading edge of an internal wave. Subsequently,
we propose a mechanism, referred to as the modulation-resonance mechanism,
underlying these surface phenomena, based on our numerical simulations. The
proposed modulation-resonance mechanism combines the linear modulation
(ray-based) theory for the spatiotemporal asymmetric behavior of surface waves
and the nonlinear class 3 triad resonance theory for the energy focusing of
surface waves around the resonant wavenumber $k_{\mathrm{res}}$ in Fourier
space.

several groups have, in recent years, studied the number of linear regions
$\ell$ of piecewise linear functions generated by deep neural networks (DNN).
In particular, they showed that $\ell$ can grow exponentially with the number
of network parameters $p$, a property often used to explain the advantages of
DNNs over shallow NNs in approximating complicated functions. Nonetheless, a
simple dimension argument shows that DNNs cannot generate all piecewise linear
functions with $\ell$ linear regions as soon as $\ell > p$. It is thus natural
to seek to characterize specific families of functions with $\ell$ linear
regions that can be constructed by DNNs. Iterated Function Systems (IFS)
generate sequences of piecewise linear functions $F_k$ with a number of linear
regions exponential in $k$. We show that, under mild assumptions, $F_k$ can be
generated by a NN using only $\mathcal{O}(k)$ parameters. IFS are used
extensively to generate, at low computational cost, natural-looking landscape
textures in artificial images. They have also been proposed for compression of
natural images, albeit with less commercial success. The surprisingly good
performance of this fractal-based compression suggests that our visual system
may lock in, to some extent, on self-similarities in images. The combination of
this phenomenon with the capacity, demonstrated here, of DNNs to efficiently
approximate IFS may contribute to the success of DNNs, particularly striking
for image processing tasks, as well as suggest new algorithms for representing
self similarities in images based on the DNN mechanism.

solving planning and search problems. The cost of the solution it produces is
guaranteed to be at most W times the optimal solution cost, where W is the
weight wA* uses in prioritizing open nodes. W is therefore a suboptimality
bound for the solution produced by wA*. There is broad consensus that this
bound is not very accurate, that the actual suboptimality of wA*'s solution is
often much less than W times optimal. However, there is very little published
evidence supporting that view, and no existing explanation of why W is a poor
bound. This paper fills in these gaps in the literature. We begin with a
large-scale experiment demonstrating that, across a wide variety of domains and
heuristics for those domains, W is indeed very often far from the true
suboptimality of wA*'s solution. We then analytically identify the potential
sources of error. Finally, we present a practical method for correcting for two
of these sources of error and experimentally show that the correction

fastest-spinning pulsar for which the intrinsic spin-down rate has been

ten lowest of all known pulsars. This discovery is another example of an

down the maximum spin frequency and the minimum surface magnetic field strength

immediate and future returns are fundamental questions for a typical
ride-hailing platform. We model ride-hailing as a large-scale parallel ranking
problem and study the joint decision-making task of order dispatching and fleet
management in online ride-hailing platforms. This task brings unique challenges
in the following four aspects. First, to facilitate a huge number of vehicles
to act and learn efficiently and robustly, we treat each region cell as an
agent and build a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. Second, to
coordinate the agents from different regions to achieve long-term benefits, we
leverage the geographical hierarchy of the region grids to perform hierarchical
reinforcement learning. Third, to deal with the heterogeneous and variant
action space for joint order dispatching and fleet management, we design the
action as the ranking weight vector to rank and select the specific order or
the fleet management destination in a unified formulation. Fourth, to achieve
the multi-scale ride-hailing platform, we conduct the decision-making process
in a hierarchical way where a multi-head attention mechanism is utilized to
incorporate the impacts of neighbor agents and capture the key agent in each
scale. The whole novel framework is named as CoRide. Extensive experiments
based on multiple cities real-world data as well as analytic synthetic data
demonstrate that CoRide provides superior performance in terms of platform
revenue and user experience in the task of city-wide hybrid order dispatching
and fleet management over strong baselines.

of these puzzeling transients and opened up the way for relating properties of
short GRBs to those of their progenitor stars and their surroundings. Here we
review an extensive analysis of the prompt gamma-ray and late afterglows of
this event. We show that a fraction of polar ejecta from the merger had been
accelerated to ultra-relativistic speeds. This structured jet had an initial
Lorentz factor of about $260$ in our direction - $\mathcal{O}(10^\circ)$ from
the jet's axis - and was a few orders of magnitude less dense than in typical
short GRBs. At the time of arrival to circum-burst material the
ultra-relativistic jet had a close to Gaussian profile and a Lorentz factor
$\gtrsim 130$ in its core. It had retained in some extent its internal
collimation and coherence, but had extended laterally to create mildly
relativistic lobes - a {\it cocoon}. External shocks on the far from center
inhomogeneous circum-burst material and low density of colliding shells
generated slow rising afterglows. The circum-burst material was somehow
correlated with the merger and it is possible that it contained recently
ejected material from glitching, which had resumed due to the deformation of
neutron stars crust by tidal forces in the latest stages of inspiral but well
before their merger. By comparing these findings with the results of
relativistic MHD simulations and observed gravitational waves we conclude that
progenitor neutron stars were old, had close masses and highly reduced magnetic
fields. In addition, they probably had oppositely directed spins due to the
encounter and gravitational interaction with other stars.

through phase wrapping during a radial minor merger. Alternatively, there could
be barely a space wrapping, when particles have not made any radial oscillation
yet, but are bound by their radial expansion, or produce an edge-brightened
feature. These can be distinguished, because they are expected to keep a high
radial velocity. While shells are first a stellar phenomenon, HI and CO
observations have revealed neutral gas associated with shells. Some of the gas,
the most diffuse and dissipative, is expected to be driven quickly to the
center if it is travelling on nearly radial orbits. Molecular gas, distributed
in dense clumps, is less dissipative, and may be associated to shells, and
determine their velocity, too difficult to obtain from stars. We present here a
search for molecular gas in nine shell galaxies with the IRAM-30m telescope.
Six of them are detected in their galaxy center, and in three galaxies, we
clearly detect molecular gas in shells. The derived amount of molecular gas
varies from 1.5 10$^8$ to 3.4 10$^9$ M$_\odot$ in the shells. For two of them
(Arp 10 and NGC 3656), the shells are characteristic of an oblate system. Their
velocity is nearly systemic, and we conclude that these shells are
phase-wrapped. For the third one (NGCB3934) the shells appear to participate to
the rotation, and follow up with higher spatial resolution is required to

However, most existing methods are not real-time, complicating their deployment

real-time instance segmentation, called `Straight to Shapes' (STS), which makes
use of low-dimensional shape embedding spaces to directly regress to object
shape masks. The STS model can run at 35 FPS on a high-end desktop, but its
accuracy is significantly worse than that of offline state-of-the-art methods.
We leverage recent advances in the design and training of deep instance

keeping its real-time capabilities intact. In particular, we find that
parameter sharing, more aggressive data augmentation and the use of structured
loss for shape mask prediction all provide a useful boost to the network
performance. Our proposed approach, `Straight to Shapes++', achieves a
remarkable 19.7 point improvement in mAP (at IOU of 0.5) over the original
method as evaluated on the PASCAL VOC dataset, thus redefining the accuracy
frontier at real-time speeds. Since the accuracy of instance segmentation is
closely tied to that of object bounding box prediction, we also study the error
profile of the latter and examine the failure modes of our method for future
improvements.

and privacy challenges of blockchain payments. Current proposals, however,
require synchrony assumptions to preserve the safety of a channel, leaking to
an adversary the exact amount of time needed to control the network for a
successful attack. In this paper, we introduce Brick, the first payment channel
that remains secure under network asynchrony and concurrently provides correct
incentives. The core idea is to incorporate the conflict resolution process
within the channel by introducing a rational committee of external parties,
called Wardens. Hence, if a party wants to close a channel unilaterally, it can
only get the committee's approval for the last valid state. Brick provides
sub-second latency because it does not employ heavy-weight consensus. Instead,
Brick uses consistent broadcast to announce updates and close the channel, a
light-weight abstraction that is powerful enough to preserve safety and
liveness to any rational parties. Furthermore, we consider permissioned
blockchains, where the additional property of auditability might be desired for
regulatory purposes. We introduce Brick+, an off-chain construction that
provides auditability on top of Brick without conflicting with its privacy
guarantees. We formally define the properties our payment channel construction
should fulfill, and prove that both Brick and Brick+ satisfy them. We also
design incentives for Brick such that honest and rational behavior aligns.
Finally, we provide a reference implementation of the smart contracts in
Solidity.

Traditional economics papers address screening models where employers access

theoretical analysis to a multi-test setting, considering both Bernoulli and

sets a fixed number of tests per candidate and when the employer can set a

previous tests. To start, we characterize the optimal policy when employees
constitute a single group, demonstrating some interesting trade-offs.
Subsequently, we address the multi-group setting, demonstrating that when the

cannot administer the same number of tests, subject candidates to the same

the early-time changes of cosmological background and perturbations arising
from the dominance of $\alpha_{\rm H}$ in the dark energy density. In
comparison to the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, our BH model
suppresses the large-scale integrated-Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) tail of CMB temperature

Theoretically, we prove that gradient descent training with either of these two
methods leads to a generalization guarantee on the clean data distribution

the connection between wide neural network and neural tangent kernel (NTK). The

the bound one can get when there is no label noise. Experimental results verify
the effectiveness of these methods on noisily labeled datasets.

Starting from the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the far past, we find that the
non-trivial gauge field background arises only significantly after the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) scales have left the horizon. At these scales, the
model thus closely resembles Abelian axion inflation, thereby naturally
reconciling the tension of non-Abelian axion gauge field inflation with the
latest CMB observations. We further consider two exemplary UV-completions of
this setup: multiple Peccei-Quinn axions and axion monodromy in string theory.
In both cases we find that the majority of the parameter space is excluded by
theoretical or observational constraints. The remaining parameter space can be
divided into three regimes. (i) For small gauge couplings we recover natural
inflation. For large gauge couplings the non-Abelian gauge theory either (ii)
mimics the Abelian theory or (iii) non-linear interactions prohibit a linear
analysis of the gauge field perturbations.

to dataset shifts and can be used for prediction in new, unseen environments.
However, these methods consider different types of shifts and have been
developed under disparate frameworks, making it difficult to theoretically
analyze how solutions differ with respect to stability and accuracy. Taking a
causal graphical view, we use a flexible graphical representation to express
various types of dataset shifts. Given a known graph of the data generating

hierarchy of graphical operators which disable the edges in the graph that are
responsible for the shifts. The hierarchy provides a common theoretical
underpinning for understanding when and how stability to shifts can be
achieved, and in what ways stable distributions can differ. We use it to
establish conditions for minimax optimal performance across environments, and
derive new algorithms that find optimal stable distributions. Using this new
perspective, we empirically demonstrate that that there is a tradeoff between
minimax and average performance.

intimately tied to the emergence and sustenance of the metagalactic ionizing
background that pervades the universe to the present day and in turn is tied to
the emergence of structure at all epochs. JWST was built in part to search for
the source(s) responsible for reionization, but it cannot observe LyC escape
directly, because of the progressive increase in the mean transmission of the
intergalactic medium towards the epoch of reionization. Remarkable progress has
been made to date in directly detecting LyC leaking from star-forming galaxies
using space-based and the ground-based observatories, but there remain
significant gaps in our redshift coverage of the phenomenon. Ongoing projects
to measure LyC escape at low- and intermediate-z will provide guidance to JWST
investigations by analyzing the robustness of a set of proposed LyC escape
proxies, and also provide a closeup examination of the physical conditions that
favor LyC escape. However, currently available facilities are inadequate for
deeply probing LyC escape at the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function.

is a crucial piece of the puzzle of disk galaxy evolution. Using data from
APOGEE and Gaia, we present maps of the kinematics, elemental abundances, and
age of the Milky Way bulge and disk that show the barred structure of the inner
Milky Way in unprecedented detail. The kinematic maps allow a direct, purely
kinematic determination of the bar's pattern speed of 41+/-3 km/s/kpc and of
its shape and radial profile. We find the bar's age, metallicity, and abundance
ratios to be the same as those of the oldest stars in the disk that are formed
in its turbulent beginnings, while stars in the bulge outside of the bar are
younger and more metal-rich. This implies that the bar likely formed ~8 Gyr
ago, when the decrease in turbulence in the gas disk allowed a thin disk to
form that quickly became bar-unstable. The bar's formation therefore stands as
a crucial epoch in the evolution of the Milky Way, a picture that is in line
with the evolutionary path that emerges from observations of the gas kinematics
in external disk galaxies over the last ~10 Gyr.

most of the conductance occurs through the Fermi-arc surface states, and it
rises in steps of one quantum of conductance as a function of the chemical

spin-density-wave (SDW) state of the Hubbard model on a quasi-2D triangular
lattice at small but finite temperature $T$. The spiral SDW order $\Delta (T)$
develops below $T = T_N$ and has momentum ${ \bf K} = (4\pi/3,0)$. We pay
special attention to fermions with momenta ${\bf k}$, for which ${\bf k}$ and
${\bf k} + {\bf K}$ are close to Fermi surface in the absence of SDW. At the
mean field level, $A_k (\omega)$ for such fermions has peaks at $\omega = \pm
\Delta (T)$ at $T < T_N$ and displays a conventional Fermi liquid behavior at
$T > T_N$. We show that this behavior changes qualitatively beyond mean-field
due to singular self-energy contributions from thermal fluctuations in a
quasi-2D system. We use a non-perturbative eikonal approach and sum up infinite
series of thermal self-energy terms. We show that $A_k (\omega)$ shows
peak/dip/hump features at $T < T_N$, with the peak position at $\Delta (T)$ and
hump position at $\Delta (T=0)$. Above $T_N$, the hump survives up to $T = T_p
> T_N$, and in between $T_N$ and $T_p$ the spectral function displays the
pseudogap behavior. We show that the difference between $T_p$ and $T_N$ is
controlled by the ratio of in-plane and out-of-plane static spin
susceptibilities, which determines the combinatoric factors in the diagrammatic
series for the self-energy. For certain values of this ratio, $T_p = T_N$,
i.e., the pseudogap region collapses. In this last case, thermal fluctuations
are logarithmically singular, yet they do not give rise to pseudogap behavior.
Our computational method can be used to study pseudogap physics due to thermal
fluctuations in other systems.

spiral arms, and extra-planar flows in I), II), and III), respectively. We
derive a generalised dynamical mass vs. [CII]-line FWHM relation. If precise
information on the galaxy inclination is (not) available, the returned mass
estimate is accurate within a factor $2$ ($4$). A Tully-Fisher relation is
found for the observed high-$z$ galaxies, i.e. $L_{\rm[CII]}\propto
(FWHM)^{1.80\pm 0.35}$ for which we provide a simple, physically-based
interpretation. Finally, we perform mock ALMA simulations to check the
detectability of [CII]. When seen face-on, Althaea is always detected at $>
5\sigma$; in the edge-on case it remains undetected because the larger

that some of the reported non-detections might be due to inclination effects.

reionization, follow the escape of ionising radiation from thousands of
galaxies, and resolve haloes well below the atomic cooling threshold. This
makes them an ideal tool for examining how reionization impacts star formation
and the gas content of dwarf galaxies. We compare simulations with and without
stellar radiation to isolate the effects of radiation feedback from that of
supernova, cosmic expansion, and numerical resolution. We find that the gas
content of cosmic filaments can be reduced by more than 80% following
reionization. The gas inflow rates into haloes with $M_{vir}<10^8M_{\odot}$ are
strongly affected and are reduced by more than an order of magnitude compared
to the simulation without reionization. A significant increase in gas outflow
rates is found for halo masses $M_{vir}<7\times10^7M_{\odot}$. Our simulations
show that inflow suppression, rather than photoevaporation, is the dominant
mechanism by which the baryonic content of high-redshift dwarf galaxies is
regulated. At fixed redshift and halo mass, there is a large scatter in the
halo baryon fractions that is entirely dictated by the timing of reionization
in the local region surrounding a halo which can change by $\Delta z>3$ at
fixed mass. Finally, although the gas content of high-redshift dwarf galaxies
is significantly impacted by reionization, we find that most haloes with
$M_{vir}<10^8M_{\odot}$ can remain self-shielded and form stars long after
reionization, until their local gas reservoir is depleted, suggesting that
local group dwarf galaxies do not necessarily exhibit star formation histories

measure molecular gas masses (\ensuremath{\rm{M}_{\rm{mol}}}) via a calibration
of the rest-frame $850\mu$m luminosity ($L_\mathrm{850\mu m,rest}$) against the

with the samples used to perform the $850\mu$m calibration. The molecular gas
masses, derived from $L_\mathrm{850\mu m,rest}$, agree to within a factor of
two with those derived from CO(1-0). We show that this factor of two
uncertainty can arise from the values of the dust emissivity index and
temperature that need to be assumed in order to extrapolate from the observed
frequency to the rest-frame at 850$\mathrm{\mu m}$. The extrapolation to
850$\mathrm{\mu m}$ therefore has a smaller effect on the accuracy of \Mmol\
derived via single-band dust-continuum observations than the assumed

conclude that single-band observations of long-wavelength dust emission can be
used to reliably constrain the molecular gas masses of massive, star-forming

dominance in individual sources, we use the flux-flux variations to determine
the slope $m$ of the ${\rm log}\,f_{\rm opt} - {\rm log}\,f_{\gamma}$

intermediate synchrotron-peak objects showing larger $m$ than low
synchrotron-peak objects. We find that $m$ is naturally decreased through
pollution from the orphan (typically optical) flares and develop a method to
statistically recover, given the sources' measured orphan flare rate, the
intrinsic $m$. While source classes show composite behavior, the majority of BL

rate is equal to that of the orbital mean motion. However, the compact, and
resonant, nature of the system implies that there can be significant variations
in the mean motion of these planets due to their mutual interactions. We show
that such fluctuations can then have significant effects on the spin states of

the mean motion histories of the three planets that are thought to lie within

demonstrate that, depending on the strength of the mutual interactions within

also show that these spin states are likely to be unable to sustain long-term

account. First, the criteria for detectability of trans-TeV dark matter are
analysed independently of the particle physics model(s) involved. We thereafter
use some benchmarks based on a popular scenario, namely, the minimal
supersymmetric standard model. It is thus shown that the radio flux from a dSph
like Draco should be observable in about 100 hours at the SKA, for dark matter
masses upto 4-8 TeV. In addition, the regions in the space spanned by
astrophysical parameters, for which such signals should be detectable at the
SKA, are marked out.

characterized by dividing the total error into three main types: approximation
error, optimization error, and generalization error. Whereas there are some
satisfactory answers to the problems of approximation and optimization, much
less is known about the theory of generalization. Most existing theoretical
works for generalization fail to explain the performance of neural networks in
practice. To derive a meaningful bound, we study the generalization error of
neural networks for classification problems in terms of data distribution and
neural network smoothness. We introduce the cover complexity (CC) to measure
the difficulty of learning a data set and the inverse of the modulus of
continuity to quantify neural network smoothness. A quantitative bound for
expected accuracy/error is derived by considering both the CC and neural
network smoothness. Although most of the analysis is general and not specific
to neural networks, we validate our theoretical assumptions and results
numerically for neural networks by several data sets of images. The numerical
results confirm that the expected error of trained networks scaled with the
square root of the number of classes has a linear relationship with respect to
the CC. We also observe a clear consistency between test loss and neural
network smoothness during the training process. In addition, we demonstrate
empirically that the neural network smoothness decreases when the network size
increases whereas the smoothness is insensitive to training dataset size.

input. In this paper, we study the possibility of transforming a deep neural
network to another network with a different number of units or layers, which
can be either equivalent, a local exact approximation, or a global linear
approximation of the original network. On the practical side, we show that
certain rectified linear units (ReLUs) can be safely removed from a network if
they are always active or inactive for any valid input. If we only need an
equivalent network for a smaller domain, then more units can be removed and
some layers collapsed. On the theoretical side, we constructively show that for
any feed-forward ReLU network, there exists a global linear approximation to a
2-hidden-layer shallow network with a fixed number of units. This result is a
balance between the increasing number of units for arbitrary approximation with
a single layer and the known upper bound of $\lceil log(n_0+1)\rceil +1$ layers
for exact representation, where $n_0$ is the input dimension. While the
transformed network may require an exponential number of units to capture the
activation patterns of the original network, we show that it can be made
substantially smaller by only accounting for the patterns that define linear
regions. Based on experiments with ReLU networks on the MNIST dataset, we found
that $l_1$-regularization and adversarial training reduces the number of linear
regions significantly as the number of stable units increases due to weight
sparsity. Therefore, we can also intentionally train ReLU networks to allow for
effective loss-less compression and approximation.

\textit{EnLink} adopts a locally adaptive distance metric and eliminates the

human input for parameter tuning so we modified SNN to run in two stages. We
first ran the original SNN 7,000 times, each with a randomly generated sample
according to within-source co-variance matrices provided in \textit{Gaia} DR2
and random parameter values within reasonable ranges. During the second stage,
we modified SNN to identify the most repeating stellar groups from 25,798 we
obtained in the first stage. We reveal 21 spatially- and kinematically-coherent
groups in the Orion complex, 12 of which previously unknown. The groups show a
wide distribution of distances extending as far as about 150 pc in front of the
star-forming Orion molecular clouds, to about 50 pc beyond them where we find,
unexpectedly, several groups. Our results expose to view the wealth of
sub-structure in the OB association, within and beyond the classical Blaauw
Orion OBI sub-groups. A full characterization of the new groups is of the

reformulation -- which we refer to as augmented measurement sensor fusion (SF)
-- is conceptually interesting, because the transformed system here is
seemingly static (as there is effectively no process model), but we can still
capture the state dynamics inherent to the KF by folding the process model into
the measurement space. Further, this reformulation of the KF turns out to be
useful in settings in which past states are observed eventually (at some lag).
Here, when the measurement noise covariance is estimated by the empirical
covariance, we show that the state predictions from SF are equivalent to those
from a regression of past states on past measurements, subject to particular
linear constraints (reflecting the relationships encoded in the measurement
map). This allows us to port standard ideas (say, regularization methods) in
regression over to dynamical systems. For example, we can posit multiple
candidate process models, fold all of them into the measurement model,
transform to the regression perspective, and apply $\ell_1$ penalization to
perform process model selection. We give various empirical demonstrations, and

Plasmonic hot-spots generated at the pinnacle of the sharp spikes, due to the

the geometrical boundaries of a nanostructure. The presence of both types of

itself to straightforward metrics. In this paper, we introduce a benchmarking
framework called COSET for standardizing the evaluation of neural program
embeddings. COSET consists of a diverse dataset of programs in source-code
format, labeled by human experts according to a number of program properties of
interest. A point of novelty is a suite of program transformations included in
COSET. These transformations when applied to the base dataset can simulate
natural changes to program code due to optimization and refactoring and can
serve as a ""debugging"" tool for classification mistakes. We conducted a pilot
study on four prominent models: TreeLSTM, gated graph neural network (GGNN),
AST-Path neural network (APNN), and DYPRO. We found that COSET is useful in
identifying the strengths and limitations of each model and in pinpointing
specific syntactic and semantic characteristics of programs that pose
challenges.

the prey diffuses at the rate much smaller than that of the predator and when
both the predator and the prey diffuse very slowly. Both situations are
captured as singular perturbations of the associated limiting systems. In the

fronts supported by the full system are small perturbations of the Fisher-KPP

model. In the second situation for the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model we prove the
existence of the fronts but without observing a direct relation with Fisher-KPP

mostly built on pixel-level operations, which may produce unacceptable
artifacts and are time-consuming. In this paper, a symmetric encoder-decoder
with a residual block (SEDR) for infrared and visible image fusion is proposed.
For the training stage, the SEDR network is trained with a new dataset to
obtain a fixed feature extractor. For the fusion stage, first, the trained
model is utilized to extract the intermediate features and compensation
features of two source images. Then, extracted intermediate features are used
to generate two attention maps, which are multiplied to the input features for
refinement. In addition, the compensation features generated by the first two
convolutional layers are merged and passed to the corresponding deconvolutional
layers. At last, the refined features are fused for decoding to reconstruct the
final fused image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fusion
method (named as SEDRFuse) outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion methods in
terms of both subjective and objective evaluations.

synthesizer without any text or phonetic labels and requires a system that can
(1) discover subword units in an unsupervised way, and (2) synthesize the
speech with a target speaker's voice. Moreover, the system should also balance
the discrimination score ABX, the bit-rate compression rate, and the
naturalness and the intelligibility of the constructed voice. To tackle these
problems and achieve the best trade-off, we utilize a vector quantized
variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) and a multi-scale codebook-to-spectrogram
(Code2Spec) inverter trained by mean square error and adversarial loss. The
VQ-VAE extracts the speech to a latent space, forces itself to map it into the
nearest codebook and produces compressed representation. Next, the inverter
generates a magnitude spectrogram to the target voice, given the codebook
vectors from VQ-VAE. In our experiments, we also investigated several other
clustering algorithms, including K-Means and GMM, and compared them with the
VQ-VAE result on ABX scores and bit rates. Our proposed approach significantly
improved the intelligibility (in CER), the MOS, and discrimination ABX scores

the demands of the fifth-generation (5G) networks, researchers from both
academia and industry are exploring advanced transmission techniques, new
network architectures and new frequency spectrum such as the visible light
spectra. Visible light communication (VLC) particularly is an emerging
technology that has been introduced as a promising solution for 5G and beyond.
Although VLC systems are more immune against interference and less susceptible
to security vulnerabilities since light does not penetrate through walls,
security issues arise naturally in VLC channels due to their open and
broadcasting nature, compared to fiber-optic systems. In addition, since VLC is
considered to be an enabling technology for 5G, and security is one of the 5G
fundamental requirements, security issues should be carefully addressed and
resolved in the VLC context. On the other hand, due to the success of physical
layer security (PLS) in improving the security of radio-frequency (RF) wireless
networks, extending such PLS techniques to VLC systems has been of great
interest. Only two survey papers on security in VLC have been published in the
literature. However, a comparative and unified survey on PLS for VLC from
information theoretic and signal processing point of views is still missing.
This paper covers almost all aspects of PLS for VLC, including different
channel models, input distributions, network configurations,
precoding/signaling strategies, and secrecy capacity and information rates.
Furthermore, we propose a number of timely and open research directions for
PLS-VLC systems, including the application of measurement-based indoor and
outdoor channel models, incorporating user mobility and device orientation into
the channel model, and combining VLC and RF systems to realize the potential of
such technologies.

misregulated resulting in cells with more than two centrosomes. Addressing the
question of how these cells accommodate these additional structures by
coalescing supernumerary centrosomes to form normal spindles will provide a
powerful insight toward understanding the proliferation of cancer cells and
developing new therapeutics. The process of centrosome coalescence is thought
to involve motor proteins that function to slide microtubules relative to one
another. Here we use in vitro motility assays combined with fluorescence
microscopy to visualize, characterize and quantify microtubule-microtubule
interactions. After segmenting the microtubules, their speed and direction of
movement are the extracted features to cluster their interaction type. In order

of attention from researchers in both academia and industry over the past 50
years. With the rapid development of pattern recognition techniques, automated
fingerprint identification systems (AFIS) have become more and more ubiquitous.
However, most AFIS are utilized for live-scan or rolled/slap prints while only
a few systems can work on latent fingerprints with reasonable accuracy. The
question of whether taking higher resolution scans of latent fingerprints and
their rolled/slap mate prints could help improve the identification accuracy
still remains an open question in the forensic community. Because pores are one
of the most reliable features besides minutiae to identify latent fingerprints,
we propose an end-to-end automatic pore extraction and matching system to
analyze the utility of pores in latent fingerprint identification. Hence, this
paper answers two questions in the latent fingerprint domain: (i) does the
incorporation of pores as level-3 features improve the system performance
significantly? and (ii) does the 1,000 ppi image resolution improve the
recognition results? We believe that our proposed end-to-end pore extraction
and matching system will be a concrete baseline for future latent AFIS
development.

a principled adversarial example detection method that can withstand
norm-constrained white-box attacks. Inspired by one-versus-the-rest
classification, in a K class classification problem, we train K binary
classifiers where the i-th binary classifier is used to distinguish between
clean data of class i and adversarially perturbed samples of other classes. At
test time, we first use a trained classifier to get the predicted label (say k)
of the input, and then use the k-th binary classifier to determine whether the
input is a clean sample (of class k) or an adversarially perturbed example (of
other classes). We further devise a generative approach to
detecting/classifying adversarial examples by interpreting each binary
classifier as an unnormalized density model of the class-conditional data. We
provide comprehensive evaluation of the above adversarial example
detection/classification methods, and demonstrate their competitive
performances and compelling properties.

the user experience of private automobile travel by allowing users to engage in
productive or relaxing activities while travelling. As a consequence, the
generalised cost of car travel may decrease, and car users may become less
sensitive to travel time. By facilitating private motorised mobility, AVs may
eventually impact land use and households' residential location choices. This
paper seeks to advance the understanding of the potential impacts of AVs on
travel behaviour and land use by investigating stated preferences for
combinations of residential locations and travel options for the commute in the
context of autonomous automobile travel. Our analysis draws from a stated
preference survey, which was completed by 512 commuters from the Sydney
metropolitan area in Australia and provides insights into travel time
valuations in a long-term decision-making context. For the analysis of the
stated choice data, mixed logit models are estimated. Based on the empirical
results, no changes in the valuation of travel time due to the advent of AVs
should be expected. However, given the hypothetical nature of the stated
preference survey, the results may be affected by methodological limitations.

that for $R > 1/4$ there is at least one peculiar phase transition accompanied
by a spin-glass-like freezing to a highly degenerate state consisting of frozen

spite of the local ordering within the respective domains there is no ordering

settings: predict the unknown parameters of an optimization problem, and then
solve the problem using the predicted values of the parameters. A natural loss
function in this environment is to consider the cost of the decisions induced
by the predicted parameters, in contrast to the prediction error of the
parameters. This loss function was recently introduced in Elmachtoub and Grigas
(2022) and referred to as the Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) loss. In this
work, we seek to provide bounds on how well the performance of a prediction
model fit on training data generalizes out-of-sample, in the context of the SPO
loss. Since the SPO loss is non-convex and non-Lipschitz, standard results for
deriving generalization bounds do not apply.
  We first derive bounds based on the Natarajan dimension that, in the case of
a polyhedral feasible region, scale at most logarithmically in the number of
extreme points, but, in the case of a general convex feasible region, have
linear dependence on the decision dimension. By exploiting the structure of the
SPO loss function and a key property of the feasible region, which we denote as
the strength property, we can dramatically improve the dependence on the
decision and feature dimensions. Our approach and analysis rely on placing a
margin around problematic predictions that do not yield unique optimal
solutions, and then providing generalization bounds in the context of a
modified margin SPO loss function that is Lipschitz continuous. Finally, we
characterize the strength property and show that the modified SPO loss can be
computed efficiently for both strongly convex bodies and polytopes with an
explicit extreme point representation.

the non-Gaussianities identified in the multiscaled PDFs usually associated
with turbulence intermittency and to spatially reconstruct the Gaussian and the

geometry as the one produced by fractional Brownian motion simulations. The
second component is called the coherent component, by opposition to fractal,
and includes a network of filamentary structures which demonstrates a spatial
hierarchical scaling, i.e. filaments inside filaments. The power spectrum
analysis of both components proves that the Fourier power spectrum of the
initial map is dominated by the power of the coherent filamentary structures
across almost all spatial scales. The coherent structures contribute
progressively, more and more from large to smaller scales, without producing
any break in the inertial range. We suggest that this behaviour is induced, at
least partly, by inertial-range intermittency, a well known phenomenon for
turbulent flows. We also demonstrate that the MnGSeg technique is a very
sensitive signal analysis technique, which allows the extraction of the cosmic

a kagome lattice (IAKL) is known to exhibit no long-range ordering at any
temperature, including the ground state. Nevertheless, at low temperatures it
shows a strongly correlated, highly fluctuating regime known as a cooperative
paramagnet or classical spin liquid. In the ground state it is characterized by
a macroscopic degeneracy which translates to a relatively large value of the
residual entropy. It has been shown that the presence of a macroscopic
degeneracy associated with geometrical frustration below the saturation field
can facilitate an enhanced magnetocaloric effect (MCE), which can exceed that
of an ideal paramagnet with equivalent spin by more than an order of magnitude.
In the present study we investigate magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of
IAKL by Monte Carlo simulation. In particular, we calculate the entropy of the

characterize MCE, such as the isothermal entropy and adiabatic temperature
changes in a varying magnetic field. It is found that IAKL shows the most

properties of superheavy nuclei has been investigated in a five-dimensional
collective Hamiltonian based on covariant density functional theory. The
inclusion of dynamical correlations reduces the impact of the $Z=120$ shell
closure and induces substantial collectivity for the majority of the $Z=120$
nuclei which otherwise are spherical at the mean field level (as seen in the
calculations with the PC-PK1 functional). Thus, they lead to a substantial
convergence of the predictions of the functionals DD-PC1 and PC-PK1 which are
different at the mean field level. On the contrary, the predictions of these
two functionals remain distinctly different for the $N=184$ nuclei even when
dynamical correlations are included. These nuclei are mostly spherical (oblate)
in the calculations with PC-PK1 (DD-PC1).
  Our calculations for the first time reveal significant impact of dynamical
correlations on the heights of inner fission barriers of superheavy nuclei with
soft potential energy surfaces, the minimum of which at the mean field level is
located at spherical shape. These correlations affect the fission barriers of
the nuclei, which are deformed in the ground state at the mean field level, to
a lesser degree.

given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with lengths $\ell(e)\geq 1$ on its edges
and a source vertex $s$, we need to support (approximate) shortest-path queries
in $G$, as $G$ undergoes vertex deletions. In a shortest-path query, given a

most $(1+\epsilon)$ times the length of the shortest such path, where
$\epsilon$ is a given accuracy parameter. The problem has many applications,
for example to flow and cut problems in vertex-capacitated graphs.
  Our main result is a randomized algorithm for vertex-decremental SSSP with
total expected update time $O(n^{2+o(1)}\log L)$, that responds to each
shortest-path query in $O(n\log L)$ time in expectation, returning a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate shortest path. The algorithm works against an

for vertex-decremental SSSP to obtain $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithms
for maximum $s$-$t$ flow and minimum $s$-$t$ cut in vertex-capacitated graphs,
in expected time $n^{2+o(1)}$, and an $O(\log^4n)$-approximation algorithm for

twofold; first, a new synthesis for shared control which we formulate as an
adaptive optimal control problem for continuous-time linear systems and solve
it online as a human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning. The result is an
architecture that we call shared linear quadratic regulator (sLQR). Second, we
provide new analysis of reinforcement learning for continuous-time linear
systems in two parts. In the first analysis part, we avoid learning along a

certain conditions. We make a clear separation between exploitation of learned
policies and exploration of the state-space, and propose an exploration scheme
that requires switching to new state-space trajectories rather than injecting
noise continuously while learning. This avoidance of continuous noise injection
minimizes interference with human action, and avoids bias in the convergence to
the stabilizing solution of the underlying algebraic Riccati equation. We show
that exploring a minimum number of pairwise distinct state-space trajectories

typically act by iteratively solving empirical models, i.e., by performing
\emph{full-planning} on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) built by the gathered
experience. In this paper, we focus on model-based RL in the finite-state
finite-horizon MDP setting and establish that exploring with \emph{greedy
policies} -- act by \emph{1-step planning} -- can achieve tight minimax
performance in terms of regret, $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{HSAT})$. Thus,
full-planning in model-based RL can be avoided altogether without any
performance degradation, and, by doing so, the computational complexity
decreases by a factor of $S$. The results are based on a novel analysis of
real-time dynamic programming, then extended to model-based RL. Specifically,
we generalize existing algorithms that perform full-planning to such that act
by 1-step planning. For these generalizations, we prove regret bounds with the
same rate as their full-planning counterparts.

shows that loss functions can be optimized with metalearning as well, and
result in similar improvements. The method, Genetic Loss-function Optimization
(GLO), discovers loss functions de novo, and optimizes them for a target task.
Leveraging techniques from genetic programming, GLO builds loss functions
hierarchically from a set of operators and leaf nodes. These functions are
repeatedly recombined and mutated to find an optimal structure, and then a
covariance-matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) is used to find
optimal coefficients. Networks trained with GLO loss functions are found to
outperform the standard cross-entropy loss on standard image classification
tasks. Training with these new loss functions requires fewer steps, results in
lower test error, and allows for smaller datasets to be used. Loss-function
optimization thus provides a new dimension of metalearning, and constitutes an
important step towards AutoML.

due to the massive number of parameters. A typical training pipeline to
mitigate over-parameterization is to pre-define a DNN structure first with
redundant learning units (filters and neurons) under the goal of high accuracy,
then to prune redundant learning units after training with the purpose of
efficient inference. We argue that it is sub-optimal to introduce redundancy
into training for the purpose of reducing redundancy later in inference.
Moreover, the fixed network structure further results in poor adaption to
dynamic tasks, such as lifelong learning. In contrast, structural plasticity
plays an indispensable role in mammalian brains to achieve compact and accurate
learning. Throughout the lifetime, active connections are continuously created
while those no longer important are degenerated. Inspired by such observation,
we propose a training scheme, namely Continuous Growth and Pruning (CGaP),
where we start the training from a small network seed, then literally execute
continuous growth by adding important learning units and finally prune
secondary ones for efficient inference. The inference model generated from CGaP
is sparse in the structure, largely decreasing the inference power and latency
when deployed on hardware platforms. With popular DNN structures on
representative datasets, the efficacy of CGaP is benchmarked by both algorithm
simulation and architectural modeling on Field-programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA).
For example, CGaP decreases the FLOPs, model size, DRAM access energy and

to a domain-specific task. In addition, since the pre-training stage is
separate from the training on the main task we also expand the universe of
possible augmentations without causing catastrophic inference. We also propose
a novel data augmentation strategy that interchanges tokens that co-occur in

way. Unlike the acoustic modes, the velocity of the phason modes is quite
sensitive to twist angle. As twist angle decreases, ($\theta \lesssim

the representation coefficients, ADDL imposes a sparse l2,1-norm constraint on

Mahoney","Distributed estimation of the inverse Hessian by determinantal averaging",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In distributed optimization and distributed numerical linear algebra, we
often encounter an inversion bias: if we want to compute a quantity that
depends on the inverse of a sum of distributed matrices, then the sum of the
inverses does not equal the inverse of the sum. An example of this occurs in
distributed Newton's method, where we wish to compute (or implicitly work with)
the inverse Hessian multiplied by the gradient. In this case, locally computed
estimates are biased, and so taking a uniform average will not recover the
correct solution. To address this, we propose determinantal averaging, a new
approach for correcting the inversion bias. This approach involves reweighting
the local estimates of the Newton's step proportionally to the determinant of
the local Hessian estimate, and then averaging them together to obtain an
improved global estimate. This method provides the first known distributed
Newton step that is asymptotically consistent, i.e., it recovers the exact step
in the limit as the number of distributed partitions grows to infinity. To show
this, we develop new expectation identities and moment bounds for the
determinant and adjugate of a random matrix. Determinantal averaging can be
applied not only to Newton's method, but to computing any quantity that is a
linear tranformation of a matrix inverse, e.g., taking a trace of the inverse
covariance matrix, which is used in data uncertainty quantification.

adversarial perturbations has emerged as a challenging problem. In particular,
deep neural nets (DNNs) seem to be susceptible to small imperceptible changes
over test instances. However, the line of work in provable robustness, so far,
has been focused on information-theoretic robustness, ruling out even the
existence of any adversarial examples. In this work, we study whether there is
a hope to benefit from algorithmic nature of an attacker that searches for
adversarial examples, and ask whether there is any learning task for which it
is possible to design classifiers that are only robust against polynomial-time
adversaries. Indeed, numerous cryptographic tasks can only be secure against
computationally bounded adversaries, and are indeed impossible for
computationally unbounded attackers. Thus, it is natural to ask if the same
strategy could help robust learning.
  We show that computational limitation of attackers can indeed be useful in
robust learning by demonstrating the possibility of a classifier for some
learning task for which computational and information theoretic adversaries of
bounded perturbations have very different power. Namely, while computationally
unbounded adversaries can attack successfully and find adversarial examples
with small perturbation, polynomial time adversaries are unable to do so unless
they can break standard cryptographic hardness assumptions. Our results,
therefore, indicate that perhaps a similar approach to cryptography (relying on
computational hardness) holds promise for achieving computationally robust
machine learning. On the reverse directions, we also show that the existence of
such learning task in which computational robustness beats information
theoretic robustness requires computational hardness by implying (average-case)
hardness of NP.

simply add up, leading to a fairly large net torque, which is readily observed

Colloidal nanomaterials, with high quantum efficiency and ease of

algorithms is the question of whether randomization is needed for efficient
symmetry breaking. While there are fast, $\text{poly}\log n$-time randomized
distributed algorithms for all of the classic symmetry breaking problems, for
many of them, the best deterministic algorithms are almost exponentially
slower. The following basic local splitting problem, which is known as the
\emph{weak splitting} problem takes a central role in this context: Each node
of a graph $G=(V,E)$ has to be colored red or blue such that each node of
sufficiently large degree has at least one node of each color among its
neighbors. Ghaffari, Kuhn, and Maus [STOC '17] showed that this seemingly
simple problem is complete w.r.t. the above fundamental open question in the
following sense: If there is an efficient $\text{poly}\log n$-time determinstic
distributed algorithm for weak splitting, then there is such an algorithm for
all locally checkable graph problems for which an efficient randomized
algorithm exists. In this paper, we investigate the distributed complexity of
weak splitting and some closely related problems. E.g., we obtain efficient
algorithms for special cases of weak splitting, where the graph is nearly
regular. In particular, we show that if $\delta$ and $\Delta$ are the minimum

be solved deterministically in time

spatial localization, action classification, and temporal segmentation. In this

use both region proposals and features from one stream (i.e. Flow/RGB) to help
another stream (i.e. RGB/Flow) to iteratively improve action localization
results and generate better bounding boxes in an iterative fashion.
Specifically, we first generate a larger set of region proposals by combining
the latest region proposals from both streams, from which we can readily obtain
a larger set of labelled training samples to help learn better action detection
models. Second, we also propose a new message passing approach to pass
information from one stream to another stream in order to learn better
representations, which also leads to better action detection models. As a
result, our iterative framework progressively improves action localization
results at the frame level. To improve action localization results at the video

actionness detectors for better temporal segmentation, which can be readily
learnt by focusing on ""confusing"" samples from the same action class.

learning tasks is the need for large numbers of labelled datapoints. The goal
of semi-supervised learning is to leverage ubiquitous unlabelled data, together
with small quantities of labelled data, to achieve high task performance.
Though substantial recent progress has been made in developing semi-supervised
algorithms that are effective for comparatively small datasets, many of these
techniques do not scale readily to the large (unlaballed) datasets
characteristic of real-world applications. In this paper we introduce a novel
approach to scalable semi-supervised learning, called Local Label Propagation
(LLP). Extending ideas from recent work on unsupervised embedding learning, LLP
first embeds datapoints, labelled and otherwise, in a common latent space using
a deep neural network. It then propagates pseudolabels from known to unknown
datapoints in a manner that depends on the local geometry of the embedding,
taking into account both inter-point distance and local data density as a
weighting on propagation likelihood. The parameters of the deep embedding are
then trained to simultaneously maximize pseudolabel categorization performance
as well as a metric of the clustering of datapoints within each psuedo-label
group, iteratively alternating stages of network training and label
propagation. We illustrate the utility of the LLP method on the ImageNet
dataset, achieving results that outperform previous state-of-the-art scalable
semi-supervised learning algorithms by large margins, consistently across a
wide variety of training regimes. We also show that the feature representation
learned with LLP transfers well to scene recognition in the Places 205 dataset.

communicate using its counterpart in another domain (flower). The key

  To communicate, one directly pastes the `message' image onto a larger public

the `disguise' image (flower) alters its appearance and shape while maintaining
its overall objectiveness (flower). The recipient decodes the alternated image
to uncover the original image message using its message image key. We implement
the entire procedure as a constrained Cycle-GAN, where the public and the

that phenomenon in any system. The present study reviews a broad array of
experimental evidence for or against QGP formation in several collision
systems. It examines in particular hydro theory descriptions of spectra and

main challenge with this approach is that the measured signal consists of both
the stimulus-induced signal, as well as intrinsic-neural and non-neuronal
signals. By exploiting the experimental design, we propose to estimate
stimulus-locked brain network by treating non-stimulus-induced signals as
nuisance parameters. In many neuroscience applications, it is often important
to identify brain regions that are connected to many other brain regions during
cognitive process. We propose an inferential method to test whether the maximum
degree of the estimated network is larger than a pre-specific number. We prove
that the type I error can be controlled and that the power increases to one
asymptotically. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of
our method. Finally, we analyze a functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset
obtained under the Sherlock Holmes movie stimuli.

the value), from which the same optimal policy can be derived, yet these
different forms might render dramatically different speeds of learning this

autoencoders to perform greedy backward elimination of features. The ranker

and cosmic expansion using Gaussian processes (GP) from the most up-to-date
Pantheon compilation of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), which consists of 1048
finely calibrated SNe Ia. The reconstructed EoS of dark energy has large
uncertainty due to its dependence on the second order derivative of the
construction. Adding the direct measurements of Hubble parameters $H(z)$ as an
additional constraint on the first order derivative can partially reduce the
uncertainty, but is still not precise enough to distinguish between evolving
and constant dark energy. Besides, the results heavily rely on the prior of
Hubble constant $H_0$. The $H_0$ value inferred from SNe+$H(z)$ without prior
is $H_0=70.5\pm 0.5~{\textrm{km}~\textrm{s}^{-1}~\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$. Moreover,
the matter density $\Omega_M$ has an unnegligible effect on the reconstruction

user/item ID and attributes. Besides the high-cardinality issue, the
interactions among such categorical variables are usually long-tailed, with the
head made up of highly frequent values and a long tail of rare ones. This
phenomenon results in the data sparsity issue, making it essential to
regularize the models to ensure generalization. The common practice is to
employ grid search to manually tune regularization hyperparameters based on the
validation data. However, it requires non-trivial efforts and large computation
resources to search the whole candidate space; even so, it may not lead to the
optimal choice, for which different parameters should have different
regularization strengths. In this paper, we propose a hyperparameter
optimization method, LambdaOpt, which automatically and adaptively enforces
regularization during training. Specifically, it updates the regularization
coefficients based on the performance of validation data. With LambdaOpt, the
notorious tuning of regularization hyperparameters can be avoided; more
importantly, it allows fine-grained regularization (i.e. each parameter can
have an individualized regularization coefficient), leading to better
generalized models. We show how to employ LambdaOpt on matrix factorization, a
classical model that is representative of a large family of recommender models.
Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of
our method in boosting the performance of top-K recommendation.

appropriate $L_p$ spaces, then for any small $\varepsilon>0$ and $T<\infty$,
almost surely $$ \rho^{-1/2-\kappa}u \in
C^{\frac{1}{4}-\frac{\kappa}{2}-\varepsilon,
\frac{1}{2}-\kappa-\varepsilon}_{t,x}([0,T]\times (0,1)), \quad \forall\,
\kappa\in (\lambda, 1/2), $$ where $\rho(x)$ is the distance from $x$ to the
boundary. Taking $\kappa \downarrow \lambda$, one gets the the maximal H\""older
exponents in time and space, which are $1/4-\lambda/2-\varepsilon$ and
$1/2-\lambda-\varepsilon $ respectively. Also, letting $\kappa \uparrow 1/2$,
one gets better decay or behavior near the boundary.

  The notion of average bias especially makes sense for polynomial sources,
i.e., distributions sampled by low-degree $n$-variate polynomials over
$\mathbb{F}_2$. For the well-studied case of affine sources, it is easy to see
that min-entropy $k$ is exactly equivalent to average bias of $2^{-k}$. We show

and is shown to have the finite model property and be decidable.
  We then consider a number of extensions of these logics, including
restricting to reflexive frames to obtain a corresponding sequence of
extensions of S4. When $n=1$, this gives the famous logic of Grzegorczyk, known
as S4Grz, which is the strongest modal companion to intuitionistic
propositional logic. A topological semantic analysis shows that the $n$-th
member of the sequence of extensions of S4 is the logic of hereditarily
$n+1$-irresolvable spaces when the modality $\Diamond$ is interpreted as the
topological closure operation. We also study the definability of this class of

that the objective function decreases after every gradient descent update. We

arXiv:1010.1030 (2010)]. The key constituents of this resource theory are
quantum boxes, consisting of a pair of quantum states, which can be manipulated
for free by means of an arbitrary quantum channel. We introduce bits of
asymmetric distinguishability as the basic currency in this resource theory,
and we prove that it is a reversible resource theory in the asymptotic limit,
with the quantum relative entropy being the fundamental rate of resource
interconversion. The distillable distinguishability is the optimal rate at
which a quantum box consisting of independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) states can be converted to bits of asymmetric distinguishability, and
the distinguishability cost is the optimal rate for the reverse transformation.
Both of these quantities are equal to the quantum relative entropy. The exact
one-shot distillable distinguishability is equal to the min-relative entropy,
and the exact one-shot distinguishability cost is equal to the max-relative
entropy. Generalizing these results, the approximate one-shot distillable
distinguishability is equal to the smooth min-relative entropy, and the
approximate one-shot distinguishability cost is equal to the smooth
max-relative entropy. As a notable application of the former results, we prove
that the optimal rate of asymptotic conversion from a pair of i.i.d. quantum
states to another pair of i.i.d. quantum states is fully characterized by the
ratio of their quantum relative entropies.

of computers followed the von Neumann architecture that strictly separates
logic operations and memory. Today, there is a revived interest in alternative
computation models accompanied by the necessity to develop corresponding
hardware architectures. The Ising machine, for example, is a variant of the
celebrated Hopfield network based on the Ising model. It can be realized with
artifcial spins such as the `parametron' that arises in driven nonlinear
resonators. The parametron encodes binary information in the phase state of its
oscillation. It enables, in principle, logic operations without energy transfer
and the corresponding speed limitations. In this work, we experimentally
demonstrate flipping of parametron phase states on a timescale of an
oscillation period, much faster than the ringdown time \tau that is often
(erroneously) deemed a fundamental limit for resonator operations. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for resonator-based logic architectures.

Non-equilibrium ionization~(NEI) is important in rapidly evolving systems where
the thermodynamical timescale is shorter than the ionization or recombination
time scales. We investigate the effects of NEI on EUV and X-ray observations by
the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamic Observatory and
X-ray Telescope (XRT) on board Hinode. Our model assumes that the plasma is
initially in ionization equilibrium at low temperature, and it is heated
rapidly by a shock or magnetic reconnection. We tabulate the responses of the
AIA and XRT passbands as functions of temperature and a characteristic
timescale, $n_{e}t$. We find that most of the ions reach equilibrium at
$n_{e}t\leq$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$s. Comparing ratios of the responses between
different passbands allows us to determine whether a combination of plasmas at
temperatures in ionization equilibrium can account for a given AIA and XRT
observation. It also expresses how far the observed plasma is from equilibrium
ionization. We apply the ratios to a supra-arcade plasma sheet on 2012 January
27. We find that the closer the plasma is to the arcade, the closer it is to a
single-temperature plasma in ionization equilibrium. We also utilize the set of

many visual recognition tasks. Despite recent successes of deep convolutional
networks, it remains challenging to model non-local context relations between
visual features. A promising strategy is to model the feature context by a
fully-connected graph neural network (GNN), which augments traditional
convolutional features with an estimated non-local context representation.
However, most GNN-based approaches require computing a dense graph affinity
matrix and hence have difficulty in scaling up to tackle complex real-world
visual problems. In this work, we propose an efficient and yet flexible
non-local relation representation based on a novel class of graph neural
networks. Our key idea is to introduce a latent space to reduce the complexity
of graph, which allows us to use a low-rank representation for the graph
affinity matrix and to achieve a linear complexity in computation. Extensive
experimental evaluations on three major visual recognition tasks show that our
method outperforms the prior works with a large margin while maintaining a low

two-player non-local game. It is well-known that it is $\mathrm{NP}$-complete
to decide whether the classical value of a non-local game is 1 or $1-
\epsilon$. Furthermore, as long as $\epsilon$ is small enough, this result does
not depend on the gap $\epsilon$. In contrast, a recent result of Fitzsimons,
Ji, Vidick, and Yuen shows that the complexity of computing the quantum value
grows without bound as the gap $\epsilon$ decreases. In this paper, we show
that this also holds for the commuting-operator value of a game. Specifically,
in the language of multi-prover interactive proofs, we show that the power of
$\mathrm{MIP}^{co}(2,1,1,s)$ (proofs with two provers, one round, completeness
probability $1$, soundness probability $s$, and commuting-operator strategies)
can increase without bound as the gap $1-s$ gets arbitrarily small.
  Our results also extend naturally in two ways, to perfect zero-knowledge
protocols, and to lower bounds on the complexity of computing the
approximately-commuting value of a game. Thus we get lower bounds on the
complexity class $\mathrm{PZK}$-$\mathrm{MIP}^{co}_{\delta}(2,1,1,s)$ of
perfect zero-knowledge multi-prover proofs with approximately-commuting
operator strategies, as the gap $1-s$ gets arbitrarily small. While we do not
know any computable time upper bound on the class $\mathrm{MIP}^{co}$, a result
of the first author and Vidick shows that for $s = 1-1/\text{poly}(f(n))$ and
$\delta = 1/\text{poly}(f(n))$, the class $\mathrm{MIP}^{co}_\delta(2,1,1,s)$,
with constant communication from the provers, is contained in
$\mathrm{TIME}(\exp(\text{poly}(f(n))))$. We give a lower bound of
$\mathrm{coNTIME}(f(n))$ (ignoring constants inside the function) for this

cosmological probes provided all systematic effects are under control.
Recently, the ejection of gas due to feedback energy from active galactic
nuclei (AGN) has been identified as major source of uncertainty, challenging
the success of future weak-lensing probes in terms of cosmology. In this paper
we investigate the effects of baryons on the number of weak-lensing peaks in
the convergence field. Our analysis is based on full-sky convergence maps
constructed via light-cones from $N$-body simulations, and we rely on the
baryonic correction model of Schneider et al. (2019) to model the baryonic
effects on the density field. As a result we find that the baryonic effects
strongly depend on the Gaussian smoothing applied to the convergence map. For a
DES-like survey setup, a smoothing of $\theta_k\gtrsim8$ arcmin is sufficient
to keep the baryon signal below the expected statistical error. Smaller
smoothing scales lead to a significant suppression of high peaks (with
signal-to-noise above 2), while lower peaks are not affected. The situation is
more severe for a Euclid-like setup, where a smoothing of $\theta_k\gtrsim16$
arcmin is required to keep the baryonic suppression signal below the
statistical error. Smaller smoothing scales require a full modelling of
baryonic effects since both low and high peaks are strongly affected by
baryonic feedback.

the dynamics of astrophysical jets undergoing reconfinement by external
pressure. However, these studies were limited to the case of unmagnetised
flows. Here we explore the role of the magnetic field within both the Newtonian
and relativistic frameworks. Since the jet problem is rather complicated, we
focus instead on the simpler problem of cylindrical rotation and axial magnetic
field, which shares significant similarity with the jet problem, and consider
only axisymmetric perturbations. The studied equilibrium configurations involve
a cylindrical interface and they are stable to non-magnetic centrifugal and
magneto-rotational instabilities everywhere except this interface. We use a
heuristic approach to derive the local stability criterion for the interface in
the magnetic case and numerical simulations to verify the role of the magnetic
field. The theory and simulations agree quite well for Newtonian models but
indicate a potential discrepancy for the relativistic models in the limit of
high Lorentz factor of the rotational motion at the interface. In general, the
magnetic field sets a critical wavelength below which the centrifugal modes are
stabilised. We discuss the implication of our findings for the astrophysical
jets, which suggest that the centrifugal instability develops only in jets with
relatively low magnetisation. Namely, the magnetic pressure has to be below the
thermal one and for the relativistic case the jets have to be kinetic-energy
dominated.

It is found, motorways are usually less favourable for drivers of (PH)EVs

thermoelectric transport is an excellent probe for revealing even subtle

allows us to understand how inertia, material properties, and loading affect
the observed shape. In particular, we combine direct numerical solutions with a
post-bifurcation asymptotic analysis to show that inertia drives the system

great progress in many real-life applications. Meanwhile, due to the complex
model structures against strict latency and memory restriction, the
implementation of CNN models on the resource-limited platforms is becoming more
challenging. This work proposes a solution, called CompactNet\footnote{Project
URL: \url{https://github.com/CompactNet/CompactNet}}, which automatically
optimizes a pre-trained CNN model on a specific resource-limited platform given
a specific target of inference speedup. Guided by a simulator of the target
platform, CompactNet progressively trims a pre-trained network by removing
certain redundant filters until the target speedup is reached and generates an
optimal platform-specific model while maintaining the accuracy. We evaluate our
work on two platforms of a mobile ARM CPU and a machine learning accelerator
NPU (Cambricon-1A ISA) on a Huawei Mate10 smartphone. For the state-of-the-art
slim CNN model made for the embedded platform, MobileNetV2, CompactNet achieves
up to a 1.8x kernel computation speedup with equal or even higher accuracy for
image classification tasks on the Cifar-10 dataset.

inverse problems in imaging -- for example, Generative Adversarial Network
priors permit recovery of test images from 5-10x fewer measurements than
sparsity priors. Unfortunately, these models may be unable to represent any
particular image because of architectural choices, mode collapse, and bias in
the training dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that invertible neural
networks, which have zero representation error by design, can be effective
natural signal priors at inverse problems such as denoising, compressive
sensing, and inpainting. Given a trained generative model, we study the
empirical risk formulation of the desired inverse problem under a
regularization that promotes high likelihood images, either directly by
penalization or algorithmically by initialization. For compressive sensing,
invertible priors can yield higher accuracy than sparsity priors across almost
all undersampling ratios, and due to their lack of representation error,
invertible priors can yield better reconstructions than GAN priors for images
that have rare features of variation within the biased training set, including
out-of-distribution natural images. We additionally compare performance for
compressive sensing to unlearned methods, such as the deep decoder, and we
establish theoretical bounds on expected recovery error in the case of a linear
invertible model.

minor overhead compared to first-order methods such as SGD. We also give
theoretical results to show that for sufficiently wide neural networks, the
convergence rate of GGN is \emph{quadratic}. Furthermore, we provide
convergence guarantee for mini-batch GGN algorithm, which is, to our knowledge,
the first convergence result for the mini-batch version of a second-order

games. These games were introduced by Chierichetti, Kleinberg, and Oren (EC
'13, JCSS '18) to model decision-making by agents in a social network that
choose a strategy from a finite, discrete set, balancing between their
intrinsic preferences for the strategies and their desire to choose a strategy
that is `similar' to their neighbours. There are thus two components: a social
network with the agents as vertices, and a metric space of strategies. These
games are potential games, and hence pure Nash equilibria exist. Since their
introduction, a number of papers have studied various aspects of this model,
including the social cost at equilibria, and arrival at a consensus.
  We show that in general, equilibrium computation in discrete preference games
is PLS-complete, even in the simple case where each agent has a constant number
of neighbours. If the edges in the social network are weighted, then the
problem is PLS-complete even if each agent has a constant number of neighbours,
the metric space has constant size, and every pair of strategies is at distance
1 or 2. Further, if the social network is directed, modelling asymmetric
influence, an equilibrium may not even exist. On the positive side, we show
that if the metric space is a tree metric, or is the product of path metrics,
then the equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time.

graph structures and are useful in a variety of tasks, from node classification
to clustering. Existing approaches have only focused on learning feature
vectors for the nodes in a (knowledge) graph. To the best of our knowledge,
none of them has tackled the problem of embedding of graph edges, that is,
knowledge graph triples. The approaches that are closer to this task have
focused on homogeneous graphs involving only one type of edge and obtain edge
embeddings by applying some operation (e.g., average) on the embeddings of the
endpoint nodes. The goal of this paper is to introduce Triple2Vec, a new
technique to directly embed edges in (knowledge) graphs. Trple2Vec builds upon
three main ingredients. The first is the notion of line graph. The line graph
of a graph is another graph representing the adjacency between edges of the
original graph. In particular, the nodes of the line graph are the edges of the
original graph. We show that directly applying existing embedding techniques on
the nodes of the line graph to learn edge embeddings is not enough in the
context of knowledge graphs. Thus, we introduce the notion of triple line
graph. The second is an edge weighting mechanism both for line graphs derived
from knowledge graphs and homogeneous graphs. The third is a strategy based on
graph walks on the weighted triple line graph that can preserve proximity
between nodes. Embeddings are finally generated by adopting the SkipGram model,
where sentences are replaced with graph walks. We evaluate our approach on
different real world (knowledge) graphs and compared it with related work.

the second to the fifth order of the cavity modes. Once we achieve the strong
coupling regime, we then modify the oscillator strength of excitons in the

free electrons, which reduces the oscillator strength of excitons until the
Rabi splitting completely disappears. We controlled the charge carrier density

communication protocols do not provide means to ensure authentication or
encryption. This means attackers with access to a network can read and write
information. Originally not meant to be connected to public networks, the use
cases of Industry 4.0 require interconnectivity, often through insecure public

different works considering several aspects of industrial environments and
their capabilities to identify intrusions as an anomaly in network or process

actual attack vectors and attacks on industrial systems is provided. It is
shown that different aspects of industrial facilities, e.g. office IT, shop
floor OT, firewalled connections to customers and partners are analysed as well
as the different layers of the automation pyramid require different methods to
detect attacks. Additionally, the singular steps of an attack on industrial
applications are characterised. Finally, a resulting concept for integration of
these methods is proposed, providing the means to detect the different stages

bootstrapped temporal difference-based methods such as $TD(\lambda)$ and
$GTD(\lambda)$ are natural algorithms. Our main result proves that natural
algorithms converge to the correct solution if and only if all the value
functions in the approximation space satisfy a certain shape. This implies that
natural algorithms are, in general, inherently prone to converge to the wrong
solution for most feature choices even if the value function can be represented

safe choice for natural algorithms and we also provide a condition for finding

principle calculations and advanced spectroscopy techniques spanning the entire
optical frequency range to pin down polaron features in 3D metal halide
perovskites. Mid-infrared photoinduced absorption shows the photogeneration of
states associated to low energy intragap electronic transitions with lifetime
up to the ms time scale, and vibrational mode renormalization in both frequency

spectroscopic features to large polarons leading to new intra gap transitions,
hardening of phonon mode frequency, and renormalization of the oscillator
strength. Theory provides quantitative estimates of the charge carrier masses

regression used in many applications. However, their use is limited to a few
thousand of training samples due to their cubic time complexity. In order to
scale GPs to larger datasets, several sparse approximations based on so-called
inducing points have been proposed in the literature. In this work we
investigate the connection between a general class of sparse inducing point GP
regression methods and Bayesian recursive estimation which enables Kalman
Filter like updating for online learning. The majority of previous work has
focused on the batch setting, in particular for learning the model parameters
and the position of the inducing points, here instead we focus on training with
mini-batches. By exploiting the Kalman filter formulation, we propose a novel
approach that estimates such parameters by recursively propagating the
analytical gradients of the posterior over mini-batches of the data. Compared
to state of the art methods, our method keeps analytic updates for the mean and
covariance of the posterior, thus reducing drastically the size of the
optimization problem. We show that our method achieves faster convergence and
superior performance compared to state of the art sequential Gaussian Process
regression on synthetic GP as well as real-world data with up to a million of

conditions that exhibit spatial and temporal heterogeneity which requires them
to adapt. Risk-spreading through spontaneous phenotypic variations is a known
concept in ecology, which is used to explain how species may survive when faced
with the evolutionary risks associated with temporally varying environments. In
order to support a deeper understanding of the adaptive role of spontaneous
phenotypic variations in fluctuating environments, we consider a system of
non-local partial differential equations modelling the evolutionary dynamics of
two competing phenotype-structured populations in the presence of periodically
oscillating nutrient levels. The two populations undergo spontaneous phenotypic
variations at different rates. The phenotypic state of each individual is
represented by a continuous variable, and the phenotypic landscape of the
populations evolves in time due to variations in the nutrient level. Exploiting
the analytical tractability of our model, we study the long-time behaviour of
the solutions to obtain a detailed mathematical depiction of evolutionary
dynamics. The results suggest that when nutrient levels undergo small and slow
oscillations, it is evolutionarily more convenient to rarely undergo
spontaneous phenotypic variations. Conversely, under relatively large and fast
periodic oscillations in the nutrient levels, which bring about alternating
cycles of starvation and nutrient abundance, higher rates of spontaneous
phenotypic variations confer a competitive advantage. We discuss the
implications of our results in the context of cancer metabolism.

pairs in near-alpha titanium alloy Ti6242Si were examined with and without the
application of load holds (dwell) during fatigue. Dislocation pile-up in a soft
grain resulted in internal stresses in an adjacent hard grain which could be
relaxed by dislocation multiplication at localized Frank-Read sources, a
process assisted by the provision of a relaxation time during a load hold. The
rate of this process is suggested to be controlled by <c+a> pyramidal
cross-slip and <a> basal junction formation. A high density of <a> prism
pile-ups is observed by dual slip, together with the nucleation of edge
dislocations in the soft grain of a highly mis-oriented grain pair, increasing
the possibility of cracking. The stress concentration developed by such
pile-ups is found to be higher in dwell fatigue (single-ended pile-ups) than in
LCF (double ended). Analytical modelling shows that the maximum normal stress
produced on the hard grain in dwell fatigue by this pile-up would be
near-basal, ~2.5 degree to (0002). This provides support for the dominant
hypothesis for the rationalisation of dwell fatigue crack nucleation in Ti
alloys, which derives from the Stroh pile-up model, and elaboration of the
underlying dislocation phenomena that result from load shedding and lead to
basal faceting.

large isotopic symmetry breaking in the $\eta(1405)\to

methods, whether learning an instance-specific or an instance-agnostic

demonstrate the existence of domain-invariant adversaries, thereby showing
common adversarial space among different datasets and models. To this end, we
propose a framework capable of launching highly transferable attacks that
crafts adversarial patterns to mislead networks trained on wholly different

The core of our proposed adversarial function is a generative network that is
trained using a relativistic supervisory signal that enables domain-invariant

both under the white-box and black-box scenarios. Furthermore, despite being an

decoupled from the SM sector. We consider different expansion histories and
find that if the Universe was radiation- or matter-dominated after inflation, a
future discovery of primordial DM isocurvature will rule out all simple
scenarios of this type because generating observable $\beta$ from the Higgs is
not possible without violating the bounds on $r$. Seen another way, the Higgs
field is generically not a threat to models where both the inflaton and DM
reside in a decoupled sector. However, this is not necessarily the case for an
early kination-dominated epoch, as then the Higgs can source sizeable $\beta$.
We also discuss why the Higgs cannot source the observed curvature perturbation
at large scales in any of the above cases but how the field can still be the
dominant source of curvature perturbations at small scales.

is especially true when ocrs are designed by recognizing characters. High word
accuracies are critical to tasks like the creation of content in digital
libraries and text-to-speech applications. In order to detect and correct the
misrecognised words, it is common for an ocr module to employ a post-processor
to further improve the word accuracy. However, conventional approaches to
post-processing like looking up a dictionary or using a statistical language
model (slm), are still limited. In many such scenarios, it is often required to
remove the outstanding errors manually. We observe that the traditional
post-processing schemes look at error words sequentially since ocrs process
documents one at a time. We propose a cost-efficient model to address the error
words in batches rather than correcting them individually. We exploit the fact
that a collection of documents, unlike a single document, has a structure
leading to repetition of words. Such words, if efficiently grouped together and
corrected as a whole can lead to a significant reduction in the cost.
Correction can be fully automatic or with a human in the loop. Towards this, we
employ a novel clustering scheme to obtain fairly homogeneous clusters. We
compare the performance of our model with various baseline approaches including
the case where all the errors are removed by a human. We demonstrate the
efficacy of our solution empirically by reporting more than 70% reduction in
the human effort with near perfect error correction. We validate our method on

solitons predicted by a naive extrapolation of the soliton-halo relation, found
in DM-only numerical simulations, for $2\times10^{-20}~{\rm eV}\lesssim
m\lesssim8\times10^{-19}~{\rm eV}$ (from Sgr A*) and
$m\lesssim4\times10^{-22}~{\rm eV}$ (from M87*). However, we present
theoretical arguments suggesting that an extrapolation of the soliton-halo
relation may not be adequate: in some regions of the parameter space, the
dynamical effect of the SMBH could cause this extrapolation to over-predict the
soliton mass by orders of magnitude.

  Perturbations?",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate sensitivity to cumulative perturbations for a few dynamical
system classes of practical interest. A system is said to have bounded
sensitivity to cumulative perturbations (bounded sensitivity, for short) if an
additive disturbance leads to a change in the state trajectory that is bounded
by a constant multiple of the size of the cumulative disturbance. As our main
result, we show that there exist dynamical systems in the form of (negative)
gradient field of a convex function that have unbounded sensitivity. We show
that the result holds even when the convex potential function is piecewise
linear. This resolves a question raised in [1], wherein it was shown that the
(negative) (sub)gradient field of a piecewise linear and convex function has
bounded sensitivity if the number of linear pieces is finite. Our results
establish that the finiteness assumption is indeed necessary.
  Among our other results, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for
a linear dynamical system to have bounded sensitivity to cumulative
perturbations. We also establish that the bounded sensitivity property is
preserved, when a dynamical system with bounded sensitivity undergoes certain
transformations. These transformations include convolution, time
discretization, and spreading of a system (a transformation that captures
approximate solutions of a system).

the effective low energy Majorana mass matrix is parametrized with seven
parameters. They are three mass-dimensional parameters, two angles and two CP
violating sources. The number of these parameters is less than that of the
general description of the Majorana mass matrix with three neutrino masses,
three mixing angles and three CP violating phases. In particular, only two
independent CP violating sources give rise to three CP violating phases. The
efficient and comprehensive method is proposed in this paper to investigate
four-zero textures in Type-I seesaw. We numerically show the possible range of
CP violating phases in the plane of a Dirac CP violating phase and one of
Majorana phases. Some cases show the strong correlations among two phases.
These correlations can be explained by hidden relations among the elements of
Majorana matrix with the four-zero textures. The hidden relations are
classified according to the position of one vanishing off-diagonal element of
Majorana mass matrix. The Majorana mass matrix all of whose elements are
non-vanishing also produces other hidden relations particularly in the case of
four-zero textures. By applying the hidden relations, we describe the concrete
correlations among CP violating phases.

consists of the longest diagonals of a regular $(2k+1)$-gon, with centre $0$,
these diagonals taken always in the positive orientation. This conjectured
minimum is of the form $k^2 + O(k)$. We investigate special cases of this

if the central angles at $0$ of all sides are equal to $2k \pi /n$. For $4k+1

escape rate into the hole relates to the asymptotic behavior of the number of
words of fixed length that do not contain the fixed set of (forbidden) words at
which the cylinders are based. We explore the relationship between the escape
rate and $r(z)$, a rational function of the correlations between the forbidden
words. In particular, we prove that there exists a constant $D(t,p)$ such that
if $q>D(t,p)$, then the escape rate is faster for the hole with larger value of
$r(z)$ evaluated at $D(t,p)$. Further, we consider two holes each of which is a
union of cylinders based at words of equal length, having zero
cross-correlation, and prove that the larger is the minimal period of the
collection, the faster is the escape rate. However, when the cross-correlations
are non-zero, we give examples to prove that this result fails to hold. Our
results are more general than the existing ones known for maps conjugate to a
full shift with a single cylinder as the hole. The existing results arise as a

Despite past works on feature clustering and selection, DEFRAG distinguishes
itself in being able to scale to millions of features, and is especially
beneficial when feature sets are sparse, which is typical of recommendation and
multi-label datasets. The method comes with provable performance guarantees and
performs efficient task-driven agglomeration to reduce feature dimensionalities

address this mismatch by considering three types of degradation commonly
encountered in remote voice analysis, namely background noise, reverberation
and nonlinear distortion, and investigate how these degradations influence the
performance of a PD detection system. Given that the specific degradation is
known, we explore the effectiveness of a variety of enhancement algorithms in

directly which limits in acceleration. Although each filter has its own effect
in DNNs, but if two filters are the same with each other, we could prune one
safely. In this paper, we add an extra cluster loss term in the loss function
which can force filters in each cluster to be similar online. After training,
we keep one filter in each cluster and prune others and fine-tune the pruned
network to compensate for the loss. Particularly, the clusters in every layer
can be defined firstly which is effective for pruning DNNs within residual
blocks. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 benchmarks demonstrate
the competitive performance of our proposed filter pruning method.

cyber-physical systems and cyber-physical networks. To both, time and energy
are the most critical operating resources. Considering for instance the Tactile
Internet specification, end-to-end latencies in these systems must be below
1ms, which means that both communication and system latencies are in the same
order of magnitude and must be predictably low. As control loops are commonly
handled over different variants of network infrastructure (e.g. mobile and
fibre links) particular attention must be payed to the design of reliable, yet
fast and energy-efficient data-transmission channels that are robust towards
unexpected transmission failures. As design goals are often conflicting (e.g.
high performance vs. low energy), it is necessary to analyze and investigate
trade-offs with regards to design decisions during the construction of
cyber-physical networks. In this paper, we present $\Delta$elta, an approach
towards a tool-supported construction process for cyber-physical networks.
$\Delta$elta extends the previously presented X-Lap tool by new analysis
features, but keeps the original measurements facilities unchanged.
$\Delta$elta jointly analyzes and correlates the runtime behavior (i.e.
performance, latency) and energy demand of individual system components. It
provides an automated analysis with precise thread-local time interpolation,
control-flow extraction, and examination of latency criticality. We further
demonstrate the applicability of $\Delta$elta with an evaluation of a
prototypical implementation.

a mere investigation of the configuration space, defined as the solution set of

kinematic singularities at a smooth point in its configuration space. Such

used in which the constraints are formulated as polynomial equations using
Study parameters. The algebraic object of study is the ideal generated by the
constraint equations (the constraint ideal).
  Using basic tools from commutative algebra and algebraic geometry (primary
decomposition, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz), the special phenomenon is related to
the fact that the constraint ideal is not a radical ideal. With a primary
decomposition of the constraint ideal, the associated prime ideal of one
primary ideal contains strictly into the associated prime ideal of another
primary ideal which also gives the smooth configuration curve. This analysis is
extended to shaky and kinematotropic linkages, for which examples are
presented.

of the continuum $\gamma$-LQG metric is equal to the exponent $d_\gamma > 2$
studied by Ding and Gwynne (2018), which describes distances in discrete
approximations of $\gamma$-LQG such as random planar maps.
  We also derive ""worst-case"" bounds relating the Euclidean and $\gamma$-LQG

answers a question posed by Aru (2015). Using these bounds, we obtain an upper

paper, we propose to use the persistent homology, a newly-invented topological
method, to systematically study the osmolytes molecular aggregation and their
hydrogen-bonding network from a global topological perspective. It has been
found that, for the first time, TMAO and urea show two extremely different
topological behaviors, i.e., extensive network and local cluster. In general,
TMAO forms highly consistent large loop or circle structures in high
concentrations. In contrast, urea is more tightly aggregated locally. Moreover,
the resulting hydrogen-bonding networks also demonstrate distinguishable
features. With the concentration increase, TMAO hydrogen-bonding networks vary
greatly in their total number of loop structures and large-sized loop
structures consistently increase. In contrast, urea hydrogen-bonding networks
remain relatively stable with slight reduce of the total loop number. Moreover,
the persistent entropy (PE) is, for the first time, used in characterization of
the topological information of the aggregation and hydrogen-bonding networks.
The average PE systematically increases with the concentration for both TMAO
and urea, and decreases in their hydrogen-bonding networks. But their PE
variances have totally different behaviors. Finally, topological features of
the hydrogen-bonding networks are found to be highly consistent with those from
the ion aggregation systems, indicating that our topological invariants can
characterize intrinsic features of the ""structure making"" and ""structure
breaking"" systems.

interacting diffusion processes exhibits a form of noise-induced metastability.
The result is based on an analysis of the associated McKean--Vlasov free
energy, which, for suitable attractive interaction potentials, has at least two
distinct global minimisers at the critical parameter value $\beta=\beta_c$. On
the torus, one of these states is the spatially homogeneous constant state, and
the other is a clustered state. We show that a third critical point exists at
this value. As a result, we obtain that the probability of transition of the
empirical process from the constant state scales like $\exp(-N \Delta)$, with
$\Delta$ the energy gap at $\beta=\beta_c$. The proof is based on a version of
the mountain pass theorem for lower semicontinuous and $\lambda$-geodesically
convex functionals on the space of probability measures $\mathcal{P}_2(M)$
equipped with the $2$-Wasserstein metric, where $M$ is a complete, connected,

the performances of FHMM and compares it with both traditional algorithms like
Markov Chain, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and recently developed Deep Recurrent
Neural Network (Deep RNN) architectures. We conduct the experiments on dataset
consisting of real data attacks on a Cowrie honeypot system. FHMM provides
accuracy comparable to deep RNN architectures at significant lower training

impressive results at object classification. However, recent work has shown
that they do not generalize well to partially occluded objects and to mask
attacks. In contrast to DCNNs, compositional models are robust to partial
occlusion, however, they are not as discriminative as deep models. In this
work, we combine DCNNs and compositional object models to retain the best of
both approaches: a discriminative model that is robust to partial occlusion and
mask attacks. Our model is learned in two steps. First, a standard DCNN is
trained for image classification. Subsequently, we cluster the DCNN features
into dictionaries. We show that the dictionary components resemble object part
detectors and learn the spatial distribution of parts for each object class. We
propose mixtures of compositional models to account for large changes in the
spatial activation patterns (e.g. due to changes in the 3D pose of an object).
At runtime, an image is first classified by the DCNN in a feedforward manner.
The prediction uncertainty is used to detect partially occluded objects, which
in turn are classified by the compositional model. Our experimental results
demonstrate that combining compositional models and DCNNs resolves a
fundamental problem of current deep learning approaches to computer vision: The
combined model recognizes occluded objects, even when it has not been exposed
to occluded objects during training, while at the same time maintaining high
discriminative performance for non-occluded objects.

The use of a special control mapping allows to fine-tune properties of the
coarse mesh like orthogonality at the boundaries. The coarse mesh is used as a
'scaffolding' to generate a boundary-conforming mesh out of a fine background
mesh at run-time. Storing only a coarse mesh makes the method cheap in terms of
memory storage. Additionally, the adaptation at run-time is extremely cheap
compared to computing the flow solution. Furthermore, this method circumvents
the need for expensive re-meshing and projections of solutions making it
efficient and accurate. It is incorporated into a space-time finite element

Although prior research has demonstrated how machine learning and deep learning

been very little research performed on the topic of behavioural biometrics in
the adversarial domain. In an attempt to address this gap, we built a set of
attacks, which are applications of several generative approaches, to construct
adversarial mouse trajectories that bypass authentication models. These

consider the attacks in a more realistic and challenging setting in which an
attacker has access to recorded user data but does not have access to the
authentication model or its outputs. We explore three different attack
strategies: 1) statistics-based, 2) imitation-based, and 3) surrogate-based; we
show that they are able to evade the functionality of the authentication
models, thereby impacting their robustness adversely. We show that
imitation-based attacks often perform better than surrogate-based attacks,
unless, however, the attacker can guess the architecture of the authentication
model. In such cases, we propose a potential detection mechanism against
surrogate-based attacks.

representations across these models. Further, in the transformer models, we
find an interaction between layer depth and context length, and between layer
depth and attention type. We finally hypothesize that altering BERT to better
align with brain recordings would enable it to also better understand language.
Probing the altered BERT using syntactic NLP tasks reveals that the model with
increased brain-alignment outperforms the original model. Cognitive
neuroscientists have already begun using NLP networks to study the brain, and
this work closes the loop to allow the interaction between NLP and cognitive

so-called sparse PCA, which focuses on seeking sparse loadings. However, the
performance of these methods is still far from satisfactory due to their
limitation of using unsupervised learning methods; moreover, the class
ambiguity within the sample is high. To overcome this problem, this study
developed a new PCA method, which is named the Supervised Discriminative Sparse
PCA (SDSPCA). The main innovation of this method is the incorporation of
discriminative information and sparsity into the PCA model. Specifically, in
contrast to the traditional sparse PCA, which imposes sparsity on the loadings,
here, sparse components are obtained to represent the data. Furthermore, via
linear transformation, the sparse components approximate the given label
information. On the one hand, sparse components improve interpretability over
traditional PCA, while on the other hand, they are have discriminative
abilities suitable for classification purposes. A simple algorithm is developed
and its convergence proof is provided. The SDSPCA has been applied to common
characteristic gene selection (com-characteristic gene) and tumor
classification on multi-view biological data. The sparsity and classification
performance of the SDSPCA are empirically verified via abundant, reasonable,

in macroeconometrics, often addressed by visual inspections searching for data
patterns. Econophysics literature enables us to build complementary,
data-driven measures of financial integration using graphs. The present
contribution investigates the potential and interests of a novel 3-step
approach that combines several state-of-the-art procedures to i) compute
graph-based representations of the multivariate dependence structure of asset
prices time series representing the financial states of 32 countries world-wide
(1955-2015); ii) compute time series of 5 graph-based indices that characterize
the time evolution of the topologies of the graph; iii) segment these time
evolutions in piece-wise constant eras, using an optimization framework
constructed on a multivariate multi-norm total variation penalized functional.
The method shows first that it is possible to find endogenous stable eras of
world-wide financial integration. Then, our results suggest that the most
relevant globalization eras would be based on the historical patterns of global
capital flows, while the major regulatory events of the 1970s would only appear
as a cause of sub-segmentation.

sub-$TeV$ energies by MAGIC, seen at redshift z = 0.42. This burst is one of
the brightest GRB detected by \fermi. A joint GBM-LAT analysis of the prompt
emission reveals the presence of sub-$GeV$ spectral cutoff when the LAT
\emph{low-energy events} (LLE) data is also examined. A similar high-energy
cutoff was likewise reported in GRB 160509A and GRB 100724B earlier, as well as
handful of other sources. The cutoff can be explained by the intrinsic opacity
due to pair production within the emitting region. GRB 190114C shows a
transition from non-thermal to a quasi-thermal-like spectrum and a radiation
component that can be attributed to afterglow. Based on spectral analysis, we
constrain the site of the prompt emission and $Lorentz$ factor. Knowing that
sub-$TeV$ photons are detected in MAGIC, we perceive that the observed spectrum
is indeed an overlap from two emission sites, where the emission observed in
\fermi is more consistent with prompt emission produced via photospheric
dissipation along with a concurrent component from the external shock.

synchronization costs in large-scale optimization, and in particular for neural
network training. However, for nonsmooth and nonconvex objectives, few
convergence guarantees exist beyond cases where closed-form proximal operator
solutions are available. As most popular contemporary deep neural networks lead
to nonsmooth and nonconvex objectives, there is now a pressing need for such
convergence guarantees. In this paper, we analyze for the first time the
convergence of stochastic asynchronous optimization for this general class of
objectives. In particular, we focus on stochastic subgradient methods allowing
for block variable partitioning, where the shared-memory-based model is
asynchronously updated by concurrent processes. To this end, we first introduce
a probabilistic model which captures key features of real asynchronous
scheduling between concurrent processes; under this model, we establish
convergence with probability one to an invariant set for stochastic subgradient
methods with momentum.
  From the practical perspective, one issue with the family of methods we
consider is that it is not efficiently supported by machine learning
frameworks, as they mostly focus on distributed data-parallel strategies. To
address this, we propose a new implementation strategy for shared-memory based
training of deep neural networks, whereby concurrent parameter servers are
utilized to train a partitioned but shared model in single- and multi-GPU
settings. Based on this implementation, we achieve on average 1.2x speed-up in
comparison to state-of-the-art training methods for popular image
classification tasks without compromising accuracy.

literature. The most famous example is Regression Depth (RD), which is a direct
extension of location depth to regression. The projection regression depth
(PRD) is the extension of another prevailing location depth, the projection
depth, to regression. The computation issues of the RD have been discussed in
the literature. The computation issues of the PRD have never been dealt with
before. The computation issues of the PRD and its induced median (maximum depth
estimator) in a regression setting are addressed now. For a given
$\bs{\beta}\in\R^p$ exact algorithms for the PRD with cost $O(n^2\log n)$
($p=2$) and $O(N(n, p)(p^{3}+n\log n+np^{1.5}+npN_{Iter}))$ ($p>2$) and
approximate algorithms for the PRD and its induced median with cost
respectively $O(N_{\mb{v}}np)$ and $O(Rp
N_{\bs{\beta}}(p^2+nN_{\mb{v}}N_{Iter}))$ are proposed. Here $N(n, p)$ is a
number defined based on the total number of $(p-1)$ dimensional hyperplanes
formed by points induced from sample points and the $\bs{\beta}$; $N_{\mb{v}}$
is the total number of unit directions $\mb{v}$ utilized; $N_{\bs{\beta}}$ is
the total number of candidate regression parameters $\bs{\beta}$ employed;
$N_{Iter}$ is the total number of iterations carried out in an optimization
algorithm; $R$ is the total number of replications. Furthermore, as the second
major contribution, three PRD induced estimators, which can be computed up to
30 times faster than that of the PRD induced median while maintaining a similar
level of accuracy are introduced. Examples and simulation studies reveal that
the depth median induced from the PRD is favorable in terms of robustness and
efficiency, compared to the maximum depth estimator induced from the RD, which
is the current leading regression median.

to reproduce the one- and two-point statistics of the amino-acid usage in a
protein family, {\em i.e.}~to capture the so-called residue conservation and
covariation statistics of proteins of common evolutionary origin. Pairwise
Potts models are the maximum-entropy models achieving this. While being
successful, these models depend on huge numbers of {\em ad hoc} introduced
parameters, which have to be estimated from finite amount of data and whose
biophysical interpretation remains unclear. Here we propose an approach to
parameter reduction, which is based on selecting collective sequence motifs. It
naturally leads to the formulation of statistical sequence models in terms of
Hopfield-Potts models. These models can be accurately inferred using a mapping
to restricted Boltzmann machines and persistent contrastive divergence. We show
that, when applied to protein data, even 20-40 patterns are sufficient to
obtain statistically close-to-generative models. The Hopfield patterns form
interpretable sequence motifs and may be used to clusterize amino-acid
sequences into functional sub-families. However, the distributed collective
nature of these motifs intrinsically limits the ability of Hopfield-Potts
models in predicting contact maps, showing the necessity of developing models
going beyond the Hopfield-Potts models discussed here.

modifies the gap closing behavior of the system. This modification induces the

response to an applied potential is still almost entirely unknown, even for
Pt-water, the most fundamental electrochemical interface. Using a general ab
initio methodology which advances previous models towards a dynamic and more
realistic description of an electrode/electrolyte interface, we simulate for
the first time the nanoscopic structure of the Pt-water double layer and its
response to an applied potential, in realistic solution conditions. We reveal
that the nanoscopic metal/surface structure and charging are not captured by
traditional capacitor models, as the electrode polarization is associated with
a charge oscillation within the double layer and a densification of the water
layer in contact with the electrode, both of which strongly depend on the
applied potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the interface dipole is not
determined by the reorientation of the first water layer in contact with the
electrode, but by its charging state in combination with its number density,
while water reorientation becomes relevant only in the second water layer. Our
findings will be essential to develop highly realistic models for the catalytic

concentration devices present the well-known dye sensitized solar cell (DSSCs)
impedance pattern. As the amount of perovskite is increased, the characteristic
impedance spectra of thin-film perovskite solar cells (PSCs) arises. This
transition is characterized by a change in the working principles, determined
by an evolution of the dominant capacitance: from the intermediate frequency
chemical capacitance of TiO2 in devices with isolated perovskite domains, to a
large low-frequency capacitance signal which divides the spectra in two

allows to link experimentally, in terms of impedance behavior, PSCs with the

the co-attentive embedding method, which allows for the reduction of the
effects of noisy frames. Finally, we fuse the outputs of both streams as the
embedding of a snippet, and apply competitive snippet-similarity aggregation to
measure the similarity between two sequences. Our experiments show that the
proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches

gravitational potential to infer stellar orbits. We did not find a difference
between the Oosterhoff groups in the individual components of the space
velocity. We report that \textit{foreground} and \textit{background} stars with
respect to the Galactic bulge stand out in the mean $V$ velocity component,
which we interpret as a sign of the Galactic rotation. The movement of the
studied stars in the central region of the Galactic bulge is consistent with
random motions expected for a classical bulge component. From the orbital
integration, we estimate that 8\,\% of the RR~Lyrae stars are halo interlopers
currently located in the Galactic bulge. The majority of the stars' orbits are
within a 3\,kpc radius from the Galactic bulge. The fraction of Oosterhoff\,II
stars increases with increasing Galactic latitude, as well as towards longer
orbital periods. We found several RR~Lyrae stars with high space velocities,
one of which has an extremely long orbital period of $\sim$1\,Gyr. We conclude
that based on their kinematics, the vast majority of the stars in our sample do

spectrum of string may be directly followed from three-string scattering
amplitude. These cubic local interactions may generate perturbative non-local
four-particle interactions, which may contribute to four-string scattering
amplitude. It was observed that tachyon field in open bosonic string theory
must be represented by a complex field in order to reproduce the Veneziano
amplitude, describing four-tachyon scattering. The Veneziano amplitude,
expanded in terms of $s$-channel poles was compared with the four-tachyon
scattering amplitudes in $s$-channel generated perturbatively and it was found
that a quartic potential term is needed in the local field theoretical action,
which describes open string theory effectively in the low energy regime. With
this quartic term, the tachyon potential has a stable minimum point and the
tachyon field may condensate. As a result, both tachyon and gauge fields become
massive at Planck scale and completely disappear from the low energy particle
spectrum.

of other protocols. More concretely, we showcase the exploitation of the
InterPlanetary file system (IPFS). This is a solution for the ""permanent web"",
which enjoys a steadily growing community interest and adoption. The IPFS is,
in addition, one of the most prominent solutions for blockchain storage. We go
beyond the straightforward case of using the IPFS for hosting malicious

  for adaptivity",,,,,"math.OC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We provide a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of gradient
clipping in training deep neural networks. The key ingredient is a new
smoothness condition derived from practical neural network training examples.
We observe that gradient smoothness, a concept central to the analysis of
first-order optimization algorithms that is often assumed to be a constant,
demonstrates significant variability along the training trajectory of deep
neural networks. Further, this smoothness positively correlates with the
gradient norm, and contrary to standard assumptions in the literature, it can
grow with the norm of the gradient. These empirical observations limit the
applicability of existing theoretical analyses of algorithms that rely on a
fixed bound on smoothness. These observations motivate us to introduce a novel
relaxation of gradient smoothness that is weaker than the commonly used
Lipschitz smoothness assumption. Under the new condition, we prove that two
popular methods, namely, \emph{gradient clipping} and \emph{normalized
gradient}, converge arbitrarily faster than gradient descent with fixed
stepsize. We further explain why such adaptively scaled gradient methods can
accelerate empirical convergence and verify our results empirically in popular
neural network training settings.

framework to sort elements that is algorithmically differentiable. We leverage
the fact that sorting can be seen as a particular instance of the optimal

of sorted values (e.g. $1,2,\dots,n$ if the input array has $n$ elements).
Building upon this link , we propose generalized CDFs and quantile operators by
varying the size and weights of the target presorted array. Because this
amounts to using the so-called Kantorovich formulation of OT, we call these

algorithms by adding to the OT problem an entropic regularization, and
approximate it using a few Sinkhorn iterations. We call these operators

cosmic structure. In observations, halo mass is typically estimated from its
relation with other observables. The resulting halo mass function is subject to
systematic bias, such as the Eddington bias, due to the scatter or uncertainty
in the observable - mass relation. Exact correction for the bias is not easy,
as predictions for the observables are typically model-dependent in
simulations. In this paper, we point out an interesting feature in the halo
mass function of the concordence $\Lambda$CDM model: the total halo mass within
each evenly-spaced logarithmic mass bin is approximately the same over a large
mass range. We show that this property allows us to construct an almost
bias-free halo mass function using only an observable (as a halo mass
estimator) and stacked weak lensing measurements as long as the scatter between
the true halo mass and the observable-inferred mass has a stable form in
logarithmic units. The method is not sensitive to the form of the
mass-observable relation. We test the idea using cosmological simulations, and
show that the method performs very well for realistic observables.

coarse mesh. Using this initial solution, the method then determines
automatically if the Hamiltonian is linear with respect to the control, and, if
so, estimates the locations of the discontinuities in the control. The switch
times are estimated by determining the roots of the switching functions, where
the switching functions are determined using estimates of the state and costate
obtained from the collocation method. The accuracy of the switch times is then
improved on subsequent meshes by dividing the original optimal control problem
into multiple domains and including variables that define the locations of the
switch times. While in principle any collocation method can be used, in this
research the previously developed Legendre-Gauss-Radau collocation method is
employed because it provides an accurate approximation of the costate which in
turn improves the approximation of the switching functions. The method of this
paper is designed to be used with a previously developed mesh refinement method
in order to accurately approximate the solution in segments where the solution
is smooth. The method is demonstrated on three examples where it is shown to
accurately determine the switching structure of a bang-bang optimal control

within the conical outflowing wind (superwind). The H$\alpha$ emission line in
the superwind is strongly polarized and the polarization pattern shows dust
scattering of central light sources, being consistent with the previous works.
The intensity weighted polarization degree of the H$\alpha$ line reaches
$\sim$30\%\ at maximum. There are at least two light sources at the central
region of the galaxy; one of which is located at the near-infrared nucleus and
the other resides at one of the peaks of the 3 mm radio and molecular gas
emission. The outer (> 1 kpc) dust is illuminated by the former, whereas the
inner dust is scattering the light from the latter. We investigated as well the
dust motion from the velocity field of the polarized H$\alpha$ emission line.
The dust is accelerated outward on the northwest side of the nucleus. A simple
bi-conical dust outflow model shows that the outflow velocity of the dust
reaches $\gtrsim 300-450$ km/s at $\sim 4$ kpc from the nucleus, suggesting
that some portion of the dust escapes from the gravitational potential of M82
into the intergalactic space. At some regions on the southeast side, in
particular along the position angle of 138$^\circ$, the dust has radial
velocity slower than the systemic velocity of the galaxy, apparently suggesting
inflowing motion toward the nucleus. These components are spatially consistent
with a part of the molecular gas stream, which is kinematically independent of
the outflow gas, thus the apparent inflow motion of the dust reflects the
streaming motion associated with the molecular gas stream.

benefit both creators to bring genuine benefits to them and consumers to help
them get really interesting content. In this paper, we propose a model called
Social Explorative Attention Network (SEAN) for content recommendation. SEAN
uses a personalized content recommendation model to encourage personal
interests driven recommendation. Moreover, SEAN allows the personalization
factors to attend to users' higher-order friends on the social network to
improve the accuracy and diversity of recommendation results. Constructing two
datasets from a popular decentralized content distribution platform, Steemit,
we compare SEAN with state-of-the-art CF and content based recommendation
approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SEAN in terms
of both Gini coefficients for recommendation equality and F1 scores for
recommendation performance.

to be especially helpful in low-resource settings, resulting in a set of best
practices for low-resource NMT. In our experiments on German--English with
different amounts of IWSLT14 training data, we show that, without the use of
any auxiliary monolingual or multilingual data, an optimized NMT system can
outperform PBSMT with far less data than previously claimed. We also apply
these techniques to a low-resource Korean-English dataset, surpassing

provided with a list of alternatives, and is asked to rank them in order of
preference using only drag-and-drop operations. The platform's goal is to
recommend an initial ranking that minimizes the time spent by the user in
arriving at her desired ranking. We develop the first optimization framework to
address this problem, and make theoretical as well as practical contributions.
On the practical side, our experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk provide two
interesting insights about user behavior: First, that users' ranking strategies
closely resemble selection or insertion sort, and second, that the time taken
for a drag-and-drop operation depends linearly on the number of positions
moved. These insights directly motivate our theoretical model of the
optimization problem. We show that computing an optimal recommendation is
NP-hard, and provide exact and approximation algorithms for a variety of
special cases of the problem. Experimental evaluation on MTurk shows that,
compared to a random recommendation strategy, the proposed approach reduces the
(average) time-to-rank by up to 50%.

popular word embedding models along the lines of gender and ethnicity but also
along the less frequently studied dimensions of socioeconomic status, age,
sexual orientation, religious sentiment and political leanings. Consistent with
previous scholarly literature, this work has found systemic bias against given
names popular among African-Americans in most embedding models examined. Gender
bias in embedding models however appears to be multifaceted and often reversed
in polarity to what has been regularly reported. Interestingly, using the
common operationalization of the term bias in the fairness literature, novel
types of so far unreported bias types in word embedding models have also been
identified. Specifically, the popular embedding models analyzed here display
negative biases against middle and working-class socioeconomic status, male
children, senior citizens, plain physical appearance, Islamic religious faith,
non-religiosity and conservative political orientation. Reasons for the
paradoxical underreporting of these bias types in the relevant literature are
probably manifold but widely held blind spots when searching for algorithmic
bias and a lack of widespread technical jargon to unambiguously describe a
variety of algorithmic associations could conceivably be playing a role. The
causal origins for the multiplicity of loaded associations attached to distinct
demographic groups within embedding models are often unclear but the
heterogeneity of said associations and their potential multifactorial roots
raises doubts about the validity of grouping them all under the umbrella term
bias. Richer and more fine-grained terminology as well as a more comprehensive
exploration of the bias landscape could help the fairness epistemic community
to characterize and neutralize algorithmic discrimination more efficiently.

when polarization is high, however, for the dynamical assisted two-color

circular polarization are observed and explained. It is found that there exists
a strong nonlinear dependence of the number density on the high harmonics of
two-color fields, for example, the number density can be enhanced significantly
over $7-8$ orders when appropriate high harmonics is present. Another
interesting finding is that the polarization effect on number density is

credit-assignment via the gradient of the output with respect to input.
Recently Adebayo et al. [arXiv:1810.03292] questioned the validity of many of
these methods since they do not pass simple *sanity checks* which test whether
the scores shift/vanish when layers of the trained net are randomized, or when
the net is retrained using random labels for inputs.
  We propose a simple fix to existing saliency methods that helps them pass
sanity checks, which we call ""competition for pixels"". This involves computing
saliency maps for all possible labels in the classification task, and using a
simple competition among them to identify and remove less relevant pixels from
the map. The simplest variant of this is ""Competitive Gradient $\odot$ Input
(CGI)"": it is efficient, requires no additional training, and uses only the
input and gradient. Some theoretical justification is provided for it
(especially for ReLU networks) and its performance is empirically demonstrated.

communication channel between a hovering unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a
central unit. Two unique characteristics make UAV-based FSO systems
significantly different from conventional FSO systems with static transceivers.
First, for UAV-based FSO systems, the incident laser beam is not always
orthogonal to the receiver lens plane. Second, both position and orientation of
the UAV fluctuate over time due to dynamic wind load, inherent random air
fluctuations in the atmosphere around the UAV, and internal vibrations of the
UAV. On the contrary, for conventional FSO systems, the laser beam is always
perpendicular to the receiver lens plane and the relative movement of the
transceivers is limited. In this paper, we develop a novel channel model for
UAV-based FSO systems by quantifying the corresponding geometric and
misalignment losses (GML), while taking into account the non-orthogonality of
the laser beam and the random fluctuations of the position and orientation of
the UAV. In particular, for diverse weather conditions, we propose different
fluctuation models for the position and orientation of the UAV and derive
corresponding statistical models for the GML. We further analyze the
performance of a UAV-based FSO link in terms of outage probability and ergodic
rate and simplify the resulting analytical expressions for the high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Finally, simulations validate the accuracy
of the presented analysis and provide important insights for system design. For
instance, we show that for a given variance of the fluctuations, the beam width
should be properly adjusted to minimize the outage probability.

small values of parameter $q$, the solutions lead to a black hole/brane with
two horizons. The values of the horizons are independent of the values of
quasitopological parameters and depend only on the values of $q$, dimensions
$n$, nonlinear parameter $\beta$ and mass parameter. Also, the solutions are
not thermally stable for dS and flat spacetimes. However, AdS solutions are
stable for $r_{+}>{r_{+}}_{\rm{ext}}$ which the temperature is zero for

attacks using the audio cues present in the recordings is an important
challenge. Most existing spoofing detection systems depend on knowing the used
spoofing technique. With this research, we aim at overcoming this limitation,
by examining robust audio features, both traditional and those learned through
an autoencoder, that are generalizable over different types of replay spoofing.
Furthermore, we provide a detailed account of all the steps necessary in
setting up state-of-the-art audio feature detection, pre-, and postprocessing,
such that the (non-audio expert) machine learning researcher can implement such
systems. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our robust replay speaker
detection system with a wide variety and different combinations of both
extracted and machine learned audio features on the `out in the wild' ASVspoof
2017 dataset. This dataset contains a variety of new spoofing configurations.
Since our focus is on examining which features will ensure robustness, we base
our system on a traditional Gaussian Mixture Model-Universal Background Model.
We then systematically investigate the relative contribution of each feature
set. The fused models, based on both the known audio features and the machine
learned features respectively, have a comparable performance with an Equal
Error Rate (EER) of 12. The final best performing model, which obtains an EER
of 10.8, is a hybrid model that contains both known and machine learned
features, thus revealing the importance of incorporating both types of features
when developing a robust spoofing prediction model.

learning, but its computational bottleneck has been a serious challenge for
both Bayesians and frequentists. We propose a model-based framework in
quantifying uncertainty, called predictive-matching Generative Parameter
Sampler (GPS). This procedure considers an Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)
distribution on the targeted parameter, which matches the corresponding
predictive distribution to the observed data. This framework adopts a
hierarchical modeling perspective such that each observation is modeled by an
individual parameter. This individual parameterization permits the resulting
inference to be computationally scalable and robust to outliers. Our approach
is illustrated for linear models, Poisson processes, and deep neural networks
for classification. The results show that the GPS is successful in providing
uncertainty quantification as well as additional flexibility beyond what is
allowed by classical statistical procedures under the postulated statistical
models.

dissimilar materials under a temperature gradient. Similarly, a thermosize
voltage is expected to be induced in a junction made by the same material but
having different sizes, so-called thermosize junction. This is a consequence of
dissimilarity in Seebeck coefficients due to differences in classical and/or
quantum size effects in the same materials with different sizes. The studies on
thermosize effects in literature are mainly based on semi-classical models
under relaxation time approximation or even simpler local equilibrium ones
where only very general ideas and results have been discussed without
considering quantum transport approaches and specific materials. To make more
realistic predictions for a possible experimental verification, here, we
consider ballistic thermosize junctions made by narrow and wide ($n$-$w$)
pristine graphene nanoribbons with perfect armchair edges and calculate the
electronic contribution to the thermosize voltage, at room temperature, by
using the Landauer formalism. The results show that the maximum thermosize
voltage can be achieved for semiconducting nanoribbons and it is about an order
of magnitude larger than that of metallic nanoribbons. In the semiconducting
case, the thermosize voltage forms a characteristic plateau for a finite range
of gating conditions. We demonstrate, through numerical calculations, that the
induced thermosize voltage per temperature difference can be in the scale of
mV/K, which is high enough for experimental measurements. Owing to their high
and persistent thermosize voltage values, graphene nanoribbons are expected to
be good candidate for device applications of thermosize effects.

evaluate intrusion detection algorithms. The biggest threat for industrial
applications arises from state-sponsored and criminal groups. Often, formerly
unknown exploits are employed by these attackers, so-called 0-day exploits.
They cannot be discovered with signature-based intrusion detection. Thus,
statistical or machine learning based anomaly detection lends itself readily.
These methods especially, however, need a large amount of labelled training
data. In this work, an exemplary industrial use case with real-world industrial
hardware is presented. Siemens S7 Programmable Logic Controllers are used to
control a real world-based control application using the OPC UA protocol: A
pump, filling and emptying water tanks. This scenario is used to generate
application specific network data. Furthermore, attacks are introduced into
this data set. This is done in three ways: First, the normal process is
monitored and captured. Common attacks are then synthetically introduced into
this data set. Second, malicious behaviour is implemented on the Programmable
Logic Controller program and executed live, the traffic is captured as well.
Third, malicious behaviour is implemented on the Programmable Logic Controller
while still keeping the same output behaviour as in normal operation. An
attacker could exploit an application but forge valid sensor output so that no
anomaly is detected. Sensors are employed, capturing temperature, sound and
flow of water to create data that can be correlated to the network data and
used to still detect the attack. All data is labelled, containing the ground
truth, meaning all attacks are known and no unknown attacks occur. This makes
them perfect for training of anomaly detection algorithms. The data is
published to enable security researchers to evaluate intrusion detection
solutions.

considered. They are the motion of particles in a uniform force field and the
precession of Thomas. As an example of using the transformation of affine
velocity in $ S $, accelerated rotation of the disk was considered and the
local angular velocity and the magnitude of the deformation of its points were
calculated. Wherein, the calculated stretching coefficient is consistent with
the known one, and the formula found for the angular velocity is more general

simulate skin effects especially at high frequencies, and this could cause an
extremely large total mesh for the whole problem, i.e. including, for example,
other surrounding structures and excitation sources like coils. Consequently,
intensive computation requirements are needed. In this paper, an
equivalent-effect phenomenon is found, which has revealed that alternative
structures can produce the same effect on the sensor response, i.e. mutual
impedance/inductance of coupled coils if a relationship (reciprocal
relationship) between the electrical conductivity and the thickness of the
structure is observed. By using this relationship, the mutual
inductance/impedance can be calculated from the equivalent structures with much
fewer mesh elements, which can significantly save the computation time. In eddy
current NDT, coils inductance/impedance is normally used as a critical
parameter for various industrial applications, such as flaw detection, coating

proposes a multi-task learning method which is composed of three main

network that predicts the time in the video clip where the question was
generated from and (3) modality alignment network that solves metric learning
problem to find correct association of video and subtitle modalities. By
simultaneously solving related auxiliary tasks with hierarchically shared
intermediate layers, the extra synergistic supervisions are provided. Motivated
by curriculum learning, multi task ratio scheduling is proposed to learn easier

$^{56}$Ni masses for CCSNe. Collating a total of 258 literature $^{56}$Ni
masses I compare distributions of the main CCSN types: SNeII; SNeIIb; SNeIb;
SNeIc; and SNeIcBL. Using these published values, I calculate a median
$^{56}$Ni mass of 0.032${\rm\ M}_\odot$ for SNeII (N=115), 0.102${\rm\

0.155${\rm\ M}_\odot$ (N=48), and SNeIcBL = 0.369${\rm\ M}_\odot$ (N=32). On
average, stripped-enevelope SNe (SE-SNe: IIb; Ib; Ic; and Ic-BL) have much
higher values than SNeII. These observed distributions are compared to those
predicted from neutrino-driven explosion models. While the SNII distribution
follows model predictions, the SE-SNe have a significant fraction of events
with $^{56}$Ni masses much higher than predicted. If the majority of published
$^{56}$Ni masses are to be believed, these results imply significant
differences in the progenitor structures and/or explosion properties between
SNeII and SE-SNe. However, such distinct progenitor and explosion properties
are not currently favoured in the literature. Alternatively, the popular
methods used to estimate $^{56}$Ni masses for SE-SNe may not be accurate.
Possible issues with these methods are discussed, as are the implications of
true $^{56}$Ni mass differences on progenitor properties of different CCSNe.

increasing throughput. There are, however, also dangers to the increasing
talkativeness of industrial production machines. The more open a system is, the
more points of entry for an attacker exist. Furthermore, the amount of data a

interconnectivity. To keep track of this data in order to detect attacks and
errors in the production site, it is necessary to smartly aggregate and
evaluate the data. In this paper, we present a new approach for collecting,
aggregating and analysing data from different sources and on three different

environmental and medical information on approximately 500,000 volunteer
participants in the UK, recruited at ages 40--69 during the years 2006--2010.
The project monitors the health and well-being of its participants. This work
demonstrates how these data can be used to estimate in a semi-parametric
fashion the effects of genetic and environmental risk factors on the hazard
functions of various diseases, such as colorectal cancer. An illness-death
model is adopted, which inherently is a semi-competing risks model, since death
can censor the disease, but not vice versa. Using a shared-frailty approach to
account for the dependence between time to disease diagnosis and time to death,
we provide a new illness-death model that assumes Cox models for the marginal
hazard functions. The recruitment procedure used in this study introduces
delayed entry to the data. An additional challenge arising from the recruitment
procedure is that information coming from both prevalent and incident cases
must be aggregated. Lastly, we do not observe any deaths prior to the minimal
recruitment age, 40. In this work we provide an estimation procedure for our
new illness-death model that overcomes all the above challenges.

  compression","8 pages, 4 figures",,,,"eess.IV cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data compression often subtracts prediction and encodes the difference
(residue) e.g. assuming Laplace distribution, for example for images, videos,
audio, or numerical data. Its performance is strongly dependent on the proper
choice of width (scale parameter) of this parametric distribution, can be
improved if optimizing it based on local situation like context. For example in
popular LOCO-I \cite{loco} (JPEG-LS) lossless image compressor there is used 3
dimensional context quantized into 365 discrete possibilities treated
independently. This article discusses inexpensive approaches for exploiting
their dependencies with autoregressive ARCH-like context dependent models for
parameters of parametric distribution for residue, also evolving in time for
adaptive case. For example tested such 4 or 11 parameter models turned out to
provide similar performance as 365 parameter LOCO-I model for 48 tested images.
Beside smaller headers, such reduction of number of parameters can lead to
better generalization. In contrast to context quantization approaches,
parameterized models also allow to directly use higher dimensional contexts,
for example using information from all 3 color channels, further pixels, some
additional region classifiers, or from interleaving multi-scale scanning - for
which there is proposed Haar upscale scan combining advantages of Haar wavelets
with possibility of scanning exploiting local contexts.

is based on a long-range dielectric-loaded surface plasmon polariton waveguide
configuration. As this configuration ensures a long propagation distance, i.e.,
small absorption into metal, and a good mode field confinement, i.e., high
interaction of the electric field with a germanium material, it is perfect for
a realization of plasmonic germanium photodetectors. Such a photodetector even
without optimization provides a responsivity exceeding 1 A/W for both
wavelengths of 1310 nm and 1550 nm. To achieve such a responsivity, only a 5
{\mu}m-long waveguide is required for 1310 nm and 30 {\mu}m-long for 1550 nm.
With optimization this value can be highly improved. In the proposed
arrangement a metal stripe simultaneously supports a propagating mode and
serves as one of the electrodes, while the second electrode is located a short
distance from the waveguide. As a propagating mode is tightly confined to the
germanium ridge, the external electrode can be placed very close to the
waveguide without disturbing it. As such, the distance between electrodes can
be smaller than 350 nm which allows one to achieve a bandwidth exceeding 100
GHz. However, as most of the carriers are generated inside a distance of 100 nm
from a stripe, a bandwidth exceeding 150 GHz can be achieved for a bias voltage
of -4 V.

networks - neural networks that can teach themselves, intrinsically motivated,
without external supervision or reward. The proposed method presents some
sort-of paradigm shift, and differs greatly from both traditional
gradient-based learning and evolutionary algorithms in that it combines the
metaphor of evolution and learning, more specifically self-learning, together,
rather than treating these phenomena alternatively. I simulate a multi-agent
system in which neural networks are used to control autonomous foraging agents
with little domain knowledge. Experimental results show that only evolved
self-supervised agents can demonstrate some sort of intelligent behaviour, but
not evolution or self-learning alone. Indications for future work on evolving
intelligence are also presented.

  Approaches",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine learning algorithms have made significant advances in many
applications. However, their hardware implementation on the state-of-the-art
platforms still faces several challenges and are limited by various factors,
such as memory volume, memory bandwidth and interconnection overhead. The
adoption of the crossbar architecture with emerging memory technology partially
solves the problem but induces process variation and other concerns. In this
paper, we will present novel solutions to two fundamental issues in crossbar
implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms: device variation and
insufficient interconnections. These solutions are inspired by the statistical
properties of algorithms themselves, especially the redundancy in neural
network nodes and connections. By Random Sparse Adaptation and pruning the
connections following the Small-World model, we demonstrate robust and
efficient performance on representative datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10.
Moreover, we present Continuous Growth and Pruning algorithm for future
learning and adaptation on hardware.

  Photonics",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electro-optic signal modulation provides a key functionality in modern
technology and information networks. Photonic integration has enabled not only
miniaturizing photonic components, but also provided performance improvements
due to co-design addressing both electrical and optical device rules. However,
the millimeter-to-centimeter large footprint of many foundry-ready photonic
electro-optic modulators significantly limits on-chip scaling density. To
address these limitations, here we experimentally demonstrate a
coupling-enhanced electro-absorption modulator by heterogeneously integrating a
novel dual-gated indium-tin-oxide (ITO) phase-shifting tunable absorber placed
at a silicon directional coupler region. Our experimental modulator shows a 2
dB extinction ratio for a just 4 um short device at 4 volt bias. Since no
material nor optical resonances are deployed, this device shows spectrally
broadband operation as demonstrated here across the entire C-band. In
conclusion we demonstrate a modulator utilizing strong index-change from both
real and imaginary part of active material enabling compact and high-performing
modulators using semiconductor foundry-near materials.
