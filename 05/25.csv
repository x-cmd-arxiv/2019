present a novel end-to-end neural network architecture that learns to form
propositional representations with an explicitly relational structure from raw
pixel data. In order to evaluate and analyse the architecture, we introduce a
family of simple visual relational reasoning tasks of varying complexity. We
show that the proposed architecture, when pre-trained on a curriculum of such
tasks, learns to generate reusable representations that better facilitate
subsequent learning on previously unseen tasks when compared to a number of
baseline architectures. The workings of a successfully trained model are
visualised to shed some light on how the architecture functions.

ingredients in many state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. In particular,
the Transformer model based on multi-head self-attention has recently achieved
great success in natural language processing and computer vision. However, the
vanilla algorithm computing the Transformer of an image with n pixels has
O(n^2) complexity, which is often painfully slow and sometimes prohibitively
expensive for large-scale image data. In this paper, we propose a fast
randomized algorithm --- SCRAM --- that only requires O(n log(n)) time to
produce an image attention map. Such a dramatic acceleration is attributed to
our insight that attention maps on real-world images usually exhibit (1)
spatial coherence and (2) sparse structure. The central idea of SCRAM is to
employ PatchMatch, a randomized correspondence algorithm, to quickly pinpoint
the most compatible key (argmax) for each query first, and then exploit that
knowledge to design a sparse approximation to non-local mean operations. Using
the argmax (mode) to dynamically construct the sparse approximation
distinguishes our algorithm from all of the existing sparse approximate methods
and makes it very efficient. Moreover, SCRAM is a broadly applicable
approximation to any non-local mean layer in contrast to some other sparse
approximations that can only approximate self-attention. Our preliminary
experimental results suggest that SCRAM is indeed promising for speeding up or
scaling up the computation of attention maps in the Transformer.

In this work, we propose ALMGIG, a likelihood-free adversarial learning
framework for inference and de novo molecule generation that avoids explicitly
computing a reconstruction loss. Our approach extends generative adversarial
networks by including an adversarial cycle-consistency loss to implicitly
enforce the reconstruction property. To capture properties unique to molecules,
such as valence, we extend the Graph Isomorphism Network to multi-graphs. To
quantify the performance of models, we propose to compute the distance between
distributions of physicochemical properties with the 1-Wasserstein distance. We
demonstrate that ALMGIG more accurately learns the distribution over the space
of molecules than all baselines. Moreover, it can be utilized for drug
discovery by efficiently searching the space of molecules using molecules'
continuous latent representation. Our code is available at

we show that stars with masses below 0.3 $M_\odot$ with discs also rotate
slower than stars without a disc in the same mass regime. Our results
demonstrate that disc-regulation still operates in these low-mass stars,
although the efficiency of this process might be lower than in higher-mass

standard for routing in the Internet of Things (IoT) networks, many researchers
had investigated the security aspects of this protocol. However, no work (to
the best of our knowledge) has investigated the use of the security mechanisms
included in the protocol standard, due to the fact that there was no
implementation for these features in any IoT operating system yet. A partial
implementation of RPL security mechanisms was presented recently for Contiki
operating system (by Perazzo et al.), which provided us with the opportunity to
examine RPL security mechanisms. In this paper, we investigate the effects and
challenges of using RPL security mechanisms under common routing attacks.
First, a comparison of RPL performance, with and without its security
mechanisms, under three routing attacks (Blackhole, Selective- Forward, and
Neighbor attacks) is conducted using several metrics (e.g., average data packet
delivery rate, average data packet delay, average power consumption... etc.)
Based on the observations from this comparison, we came with few suggestions
that could reduce the effects of such attacks, without having added security
mechanisms for RPL.

on engineering, education, medicines, to name a few, its impact on users'

office workers with sedentary lifestyles, is related to many chronic
conditions. Unlike the traditional screens, the augmented-reality head-mounted
display (AR-HMD) could enable mobile virtual screens, which might impact on
users' movement behavior. In this paper, we present our initial study to
explore the impact of AR-HMDs on users' movement behavior. We compared the
differences of macro-movements (e.g., sit-stand transitions) and
micro-movements (e.g., moving the head) between two experimental modes (i.e.,
spatial-mapping and tag-along) with a dedicated trivial quiz task using
HoloLens. The study reveals interesting findings: strong evidence supports that
participants had more head-movements in the tag-along mode where higher
simplicity and freedom of moving the virtual screen were given; body
position/direction changes show the same effect with moderate evidence, while
sit-stand transitions show no difference between the two modes with weak
evidence. Our results imply several design considerations and research
opportunities for future work on the ergonomics of AR-HMDs in the perspective
of health.

M$_{\odot}$). We find that the fraction of unbound stars differs depending on
the initial conditions. After 10 Myr, in initially highly subvirial,
substructured simulations, the high-mass and lower-mass unbound fractions are
similar at $\sim$23 per cent. In initially virialised, substructured

distributions of unbound stars only show differences for extremely different
initial conditions. The distributions are dominated by large numbers of
lower-mass stars becoming unbound just above the escape velocity of $\sim$3 km
s$^{-1}$ with unbound high-mass stars moving faster on average than lower-mass
unbound stars. We see no high-mass runaway stars (velocity > 30 km s$^{-1}$)

functional factor model approach in the analysis of large cross-sections

result stating that, under mild assumptions on the covariance operator of the
cross-section, we can represent each FTS as the sum of a common component
driven by scalar factors loaded via functional loadings, and a mildly
cross-correlated idiosyncratic component. Our model and theory are developed in
a general Hilbert space setting that allows for mixed panels of functional and
scalar time series. We then turn to the identification of the number of
factors, and the estimation of the factors, their loadings, and the common
components. We provide a family of information criteria for identifying the
number of factors, and prove their consistency. We provide average error bounds
for the estimators of the factors, loadings, and common component; our results
encompass the scalar case, for which they reproduce and extend, under weaker
conditions, well-established similar results. Under slightly stronger
assumptions, we also provide uniform bounds for the estimators of factors,
loadings, and common component, thus extending existing scalar results. Our
consistency results in the asymptotic regime where the number $N$ of series and
the number $T$ of time observations diverge thus extend to the functional
context the ""blessing of dimensionality"" that explains the success of factor
models in the analysis of high-dimensional (scalar) time series. We provide
numerical illustrations that corroborate the convergence rates predicted by the
theory, and provide finer understanding of the interplay between $N$ and $T$
for estimation purposes. We conclude with an application to forecasting
mortality curves, where we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods.

kernels in the over-parameterized regime, proving they can learn certain
concept class that is also learnable by kernels with similar test error. Yet,
can neural networks provably learn some concept class BETTER than kernels?
  We answer this positively in the distribution-free setting. We prove neural
networks can efficiently learn a notable class of functions, including those
defined by three-layer residual networks with smooth activations, without any
distributional assumption. At the same time, we prove there are simple
functions in this class such that with the same number of training examples,
the test error obtained by neural networks can be MUCH SMALLER than ANY kernel
method, including neural tangent kernels (NTK).
  The main intuition is that multi-layer neural networks can implicitly perform
hierarchical learning using different layers, which reduces the sample
complexity comparing to ""one-shot"" learning algorithms such as kernel methods.
In a follow-up work [2], this theory of hierarchical learning is further
strengthened to incorporate the ""backward feature correction"" process when
training deep networks.
  In the end, we also prove a computation complexity advantage of ResNet with
respect to other learning methods including linear regression over arbitrary
feature mappings.

little concrete evidence of significant overfitting due to holdout reuse in
popular multiclass benchmarks today. Known results show that, in the
worst-case, revealing the accuracy of $k$ adaptively chosen classifiers on a
data set of size $n$ allows to create a classifier with bias of
$\Theta(\sqrt{k/n})$ for any binary prediction problem. We show a new upper
bound of $\tilde O(\max\{\sqrt{k\log(n)/(mn)},k/n\})$ on the worst-case bias
that any attack can achieve in a prediction problem with $m$ classes. Moreover,
we present an efficient attack that achieve a bias of $\Omega(\sqrt{k/(m^2
n)})$ and improves on previous work for the binary setting ($m=2$). We also
present an inefficient attack that achieves a bias of $\tilde\Omega(k/n)$.
Complementing our theoretical work, we give new practical attacks to
stress-test multiclass benchmarks by aiming to create as large a bias as
possible with a given number of queries. Our experiments show that the
additional uncertainty of prediction with a large number of classes indeed
mitigates the effect of our best attacks.
  Our work extends developments in understanding overfitting due to adaptive
data analysis to multiclass prediction problems. It also bears out the
surprising fact that multiclass prediction problems are significantly more
robust to overfitting when reusing a test (or holdout) dataset. This offers an
explanation as to why popular multiclass prediction benchmarks, such as

wide range of DM halo masses, thus providing new opportunities for exploring
the connections between galaxies and their DM halos. Following up on new

largely used to identify AGNs in multivisit surveys. The strength of a
selection based on optical variability lies in the chance to analyze data from
surveys of large sky areas by ground-based telescopes. However the
effectiveness of optical variability selection, with respect to other
multiwavelength techniques, has been poorly studied down to the depth expected
from next generation surveys. Here we present the results of our r-band
analysis of a sample of 299 optically variable AGN candidates in the VST survey
of the COSMOS field, counting 54 visits spread over three observing seasons
spanning > 3 yr. This dataset is > 3 times larger in size than the one
presented in our previous analysis (De Cicco et al. 2015), and the observing
baseline is ~8 times longer. We push towards deeper magnitudes (r(AB) ~23.5
mag) compared to past studies; we make wide use of ancillary multiwavelength
catalogs in order to confirm the nature of our AGN candidates, and constrain
the accuracy of the method based on spectroscopic and photometric diagnostics.
We also perform tests aimed at assessing the relevance of dense sampling in
view of future wide-field surveys. We demonstrate that the method allows the
selection of high-purity (> 86%) samples. We take advantage of the longer
observing baseline to achieve great improvement in the completeness of our
sample with respect to X-ray and spectroscopically confirmed samples of AGNs
(59%, vs. ~15% in our previous work), as well as in the completeness of
unobscured and obscured AGNs. The effectiveness of the method confirms the
importance to develop future, more refined techniques for the automated

faster than direct model fitting. We conclude by discussing how this speed up
and learning how the galaxy data manifold maps to physical parameter space and
visualizing this mapping in lower dimensions helps overcome other challenges in

remarkable property of being more constrained than GR plus a cosmological

cosmological constant to have a consistent space-time variation, through coding
its dynamics in the torsion tensor. We demonstrate this mechanism by adding a
`quasi-topological' term to the Einstein action, which naturally realizes a
dynamical torsion with an automatic satisfaction of the Bianchi identities.
Moreover, variation of the action with respect to this dynamical $\Lambda$
fixes it in terms of other variables, thus providing a scenario with less
freedom than general relativity with a cosmological constant. Once matter is
introduced, at least in the homogeneous and isotropic reduction, $\Lambda$ is
uniquely determined by the field content of the model. We make an explicit
construction using the Palatini formulation of GR and describe the striking
properties of this new theory. We also highlight some possible extensions to

show that Lambda is proportional to the matter density, with a proportionality

combined with spatially-resolved optical, NIR and sub-mm and radio observations
taken with VLT/MUSE, Gemini-N/NIFS, ALMA and the VLA to map the physical
properties and kinematics of the multi-phase inter-stellar medium (ISM). We
detect a biconical extended narrow-line region (ENLR) ionized by the luminous
AGN oriented nearly parallel to the galaxy disc, extending out to at least
25kpc. The extra-planar gas originates from galactic fountains initiated by
star formation processes in the disc, rather than an AGN outflow, as shown by
the kinematics and the metallicity of the gas. Nevertheless, a fast multi-phase
AGN-driven outflow with speeds up to 1000km/s is detected close to the nucleus
at 1kpc distance. A radio jet, in connection with the AGN radiation field, is
likely responsible for driving the outflow as confirmed by the energetics and
the spatial alignment of the jet and multi-phase outflow. Evidence for negative
AGN feedback suppressing the star formation rate (SFR) is mild and restricted
to the central kpc. But while any SFR suppression must have happened recently,
the outflow has the potential to greatly impact the future evolution of the
galaxy disc due to its geometrical orientation. Our observations reveal that
low-power radio jets can play a major role in driving fast multi-phase
galaxy-scale outflows even in radio-quiet AGN. Since the outflow energetics for
HE1353-1917 are consistent with literature scaling relations of AGN-driven
outflows the contribution of radio jets as the driving mechanisms still needs
to be systematically explored.

optical 3D spectroscopy and ALMA observations. We find that: 1) The ENLR size
of 12.1$\pm$0.2kpc implies a smooth continuation of the size-luminosity
relation out to large radii or a much larger break radius as previously
proposed. 2) The kinematically disturbed ionized gas with line splits reaching
1000km/s out to 6.1$\pm$1.5kpc is aligned along the jet axis. 3) The extreme
line broadening on kpc scales is caused by spatial and spectral blending of
many distinct gas clouds separated on sub-arcsecond scales with different
line-of-sight velocities. The ENLR velocity field combined with the known jet
orientation rule out a simple scenario of a radiatively-driven radial expansion
of the outflow. Instead we propose that a pressurized expanding hot gas cocoon
created by the radio jet is impacting on an inclined gas disk leading to
transverse and/or backflow motion with respect to our line-of-sight. The
molecular gas morphology may either be explained by a density wave at the front
of the outflow expanding along the jet direction as predicted by positive
feedback scenario or the cold gas may be trapped in a stellar over-density
caused by a recent merger event. Using 3C273 as a template for observations of
high-redshift hyper-luminous AGN reveals that large-scale ENLRs and kpc scale
outflows may often be missed due to the brightness of the nuclei and the
limited sensitivity of current near-IR instrumentation.

details the numerical method that enables this translation, describes the

with a variety of example problems. The numerical method is a first-order
generalized tau formulation that discretizes equations into banded matrices.
This method is implemented with an object-oriented design. Classes for spectral
bases and domains manage the discretization and automatic parallel distribution
of variables. Discretized fields and mathematical operators are symbolically
manipulated with a basic computer algebra system. Initial value, boundary
value, and eigenvalue problems are efficiently solved using high-performance
linear algebra, transform, and parallel communication libraries. Custom

self-describing portable formats. The performance of the code is evaluated with
a parallel scaling benchmark and a comparison to a finite-volume code. The
features and flexibility of the codebase are illustrated by solving several
examples: the nonlinear Schrodinger equation on a graph, a supersonic
magnetohydrodynamic vortex, quasigeostrophic flow, Stokes flow in a cylindrical

microscopic models of fluctuating polymer rings subjected to topological
constraints. The topological invariants used to fix these constraints belong to
a wide class of the so-called numerical topological invariants. For each
invariant it is possible to derive a field theory that describes the
statistical behavior of knotted and linked polymer rings following a
straightforward algorithm. The treatment is not limited to the partition
function of the system, but it allows also to express the expectation values of
general observables as field theory amplitudes.
  Our strategy is illustrated taking as examples the Gauss linking number and a
topological invariant belonging to a class of invariants due to Massey. The
consistency of the new method developed here is checked by reproducing a
previous field theoretical model of two linked polymer rings. After the passage
to field theory, the original topological constraints imposed on the
fluctuating paths of the polymers become constraints over the configurations of
the topological fields that mediate the interactions of topological origin
between the monomers. These constraints involve quantities like the
cross-helicity which are of interest in other disciplines, like for instance in
modeling the solar magnetic field.
  While the calculation of the vacuum expectation values of generic observables
remains still challenging due to the complexity of the problem of topological
entanglement in polymer systems, we succeed here to reduce the evaluation of
the moments of the Gauss linking number for two linked polymer rings to the
computation of the amplitudes of a free field theory.

produce solid waste that lowers the environmental impact of wastewater
disposal. Evaporation ponds harvest solar energy as heat for ZLD, but require
large land areas due to low evaporation rates. Here, we demonstrate a passive

where water is strongly absorbing, efficient utilization of solar energy and
heat localization at the water surface through radiative coupling are achieved.
The non-contact nature of the device makes it uniquely suited to treat a wide

own local leader (the best performer in a group), and update each worker with a
corrective direction comprised of two attractive forces: one to the local, and
one to the global leader (the best performer among all workers). The

local workers forming a group lie within a single computational node and
different groups correspond to different nodes. For training convolutional

descriptions are commonly assumed to be identical. In this work, we show that
these characteristics of microscopic and macroscopic descriptions can be
different due to coalescence, i.e., a node being activated at the same time by
multiple sources. In particular, we consider a (microscopic) branching network

compressive strain. A decrease in lattice thermal conductivity with the
increase in temperature causes an almost 40% increase in ZT product under
applied uniaxial compressive strain. From the study, it is observed that
uniaxial compressive strain is more effective among all types of strain to
enhance the thermoelectric performance of monolayer WS 2 . Such strain induced
enhancement of thermoelectric properties in monolayer WS 2 could open a new

  Novel Graph Neural Network Approach","10 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables",,,,"cs.SI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Betweenness centrality (BC) is one of the most used centrality measures for
network analysis, which seeks to describe the importance of nodes in a network
in terms of the fraction of shortest paths that pass through them. It is key to
many valuable applications, including community detection and network
dismantling. Computing BC scores on large networks is computationally
challenging due to high time complexity. Many approximation algorithms have
been proposed to speed up the estimation of BC, which are mainly
sampling-based. However, these methods are still prone to considerable
execution time on large-scale networks, and their results are often exacerbated
when small changes happen to the network structures. In this paper, we focus on
identifying nodes with high BC in a graph, since many application scenarios are
built upon retrieving nodes with top-k BC. Different from previous heuristic
methods, we turn this task into a learning problem and design an
encoder-decoder based framework to resolve the problem. More specifcally, the
encoder leverages the network structure to encode each node into an embedding
vector, which captures the important structural information of the node. The
decoder transforms the embedding vector for each node into a scalar, which
captures the relative rank of this node in terms of BC. We use the pairwise
ranking loss to train the model to identify the orders of nodes regarding their
BC. By training on small-scale networks, the learned model is capable of
assigning relative BC scores to nodes for any unseen networks, and thus
identifying the highly-ranked nodes. Comprehensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that, compared to representative
baselines, our model drastically speeds up the prediction without noticeable
sacrifce in accuracy, and outperforms the state-of-the-art by accuracy on
several large real-world networks.

reactions $\bar p d \to J/\psi\, n$ and $\bar p d \to \psi^\prime\, n$ in
vicinity of the thresholds for charmonium production on a free proton target.
It is shown that the rescattering of the incoming antiproton and outgoing
charmonium on the spectator neutron leads to a depletion of the charmonium
production at low- and to an enhancement at high transverse momenta. This is in
qualitative agreement with previous studies of hard proton knockout in
proton-deuteron collisions. We analyze different physical sources of
uncertainty which may influence the extraction of the total charmonium-neutron
cross section. The color transparency effect for the incoming $\bar p$ largely
compensates the influence of charmonium rescattering both at low and high
transverse momenta. Different choices of the deuteron wave function lead to
significant uncertainties at high transverse momenta. As an outcome of the
calculations of charmonium production, we also provide predictions on the
production of open charm hadrons due to the dissociation of the charmonium on
the neutron. It is shown that the open charm production cross section is
proportional to the total charmonium-nucleon cross section and quite stable
with respect to the variation of other parameters of the model. We thus suggest
that open charm channels are most suited for future studies of

bandgaps suitable for optoelectronic devices including light-emitting diodes

(MEMS). Nitrides are also significantly underexplored compared to oxides and
other chemistries, with many being thermochemically metastable, sparking
interest from a basic science point of view. This paper reports on experimental
and computational exploration of the Mg-Sb-N material system, featuring both
metastable materials and interesting semiconducting properties. Using sputter
deposition, we discovered a new Mg2SbN3 nitride with a wurtzite-derived crystal
structure and synthesized the antimonide-nitride Mg3SbN with an antiperovskite
crystal structure for the first time in thin film form. Theoretical
calculations indicate that Mg2SbN3 is metastable and has properties relevant to
LEDs and MEMS, whereas Mg3SbN has a large dielectric constant (28\epsilon_0)
and low hole effective masses (0.9m_0), of interest for photovoltaic solar cell
absorbers. The experimental solar-matched 1.3 eV optical absorption onset of
the Mg3SbN antiperovskite agrees with the theoretical prediction (1.3 eV
direct, 1.1 eV indirect), and with the measurements of room-temperature
near-bandgap photoluminescence. These results make an important contribution
towards understanding semiconductor properties and chemical trends in the
Mg-Sb-N materials system, paving the way to future practical applications of
these novel materials.

leaves correspond to labels. Designing prediction mechanism with such trees for
real data applications is non-trivial as it needs to accommodate sending
examples to multiple leaves while at the same time sustain high prediction
accuracy. In this paper we develop the LdSM algorithm for the construction and
training of multi-label decision trees, where in every node of the tree we
optimize a novel objective function that favors balanced splits, maintains high
class purity of children nodes, and allows sending examples to multiple
directions but with a penalty that prevents tree over-growth. Each node of the

limited by the quality of the computational data and the availability of prior

been shown to acquire a number of non-local grammatical dependencies with some
success. Here, we provide new evidence that RNN language models are sensitive
to hierarchical syntactic structure by investigating the filler--gap dependency
and constraints on it, known as syntactic islands. Previous work is
inconclusive about whether RNNs learn to attenuate their expectations for gaps
in island constructions in particular or in any sufficiently complex syntactic
environment. This paper gives new evidence for the former by providing control
studies that have been lacking so far. We demonstrate that two state-of-the-art
RNN models are are able to maintain the filler--gap dependency through
unbounded sentential embeddings and are also sensitive to the hierarchical
relationship between the filler and the gap. Next, we demonstrate that the
models are able to maintain possessive pronoun gender expectations through
island constructions---this control case rules out the possibility that island
constructions block all information flow in these networks. We also evaluate
three untested islands constraints: coordination islands, left branch islands,
and sentential subject islands. Models are able to learn left branch islands
and learn coordination islands gradiently, but fail to learn sentential subject
islands. Through these controls and new tests, we provide evidence that model
behavior is due to finer-grained expectations than gross syntactic complexity,

emission spectrum, and for the pulse shape resulting from an episode of
electron injection. The synchrotron emission calculated numerically is compared
with the spectrum and shape of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) pulses. Both adiabatic and
radiative cooling processes lead to a softening of the pulse spectrum, and both
types of cooling processes lead to pulses peaking earlier and lasting shorter
at higher energy, quantitatively consistent with observations. For
adiabatic-dominated electron cooling, a power-law injection rate $R_i$ suffices
to explain the observed power-law GRB low-energy spectra. Synchrotron-dominated
cooling leads to power-law cooling-tails that yield the synchrotron standard
slope alpha = -3/2 provided that $R_i \sim B^2$, which is exactly the
expectation if the magnetic field is a constant fraction of the post-shock
energy density. Increasing (decreasing) $R_i$ and decreasing (increasing) B(t)
lead to slopes alpha harder (softer, respectively) than the standard value and
to non--power-law (curved) cooling-tails. Inverse-Compton cooling yields four
values for the slope alpha but, as for synchrotron, other $R_i$ or B histories
yield a wider range of slopes and curved low-energy spectra. Feedback between
the power-law segments that develop below and above the typical injected
electron leads to a synchrotron spectrum with many breaks above and below the

Zhao","Regula Sub-rosa: Latent Backdoor Attacks on Deep Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent work has proposed the concept of backdoor attacks on deep neural
networks (DNNs), where misbehaviors are hidden inside ""normal"" models, only to
be triggered by very specific inputs. In practice, however, these attacks are
difficult to perform and highly constrained by sharing of models through
transfer learning. Adversaries have a small window during which they must
compromise the student model before it is deployed. In this paper, we describe
a significantly more powerful variant of the backdoor attack, latent backdoors,
where hidden rules can be embedded in a single ""Teacher"" model, and
automatically inherited by all ""Student"" models through the transfer learning
process. We show that latent backdoors can be quite effective in a variety of
application contexts, and validate its practicality through real-world attacks
against traffic sign recognition, iris identification of lab volunteers, and
facial recognition of public figures (politicians). Finally, we evaluate 4
potential defenses, and find that only one is effective in disrupting latent
backdoors, but might incur a cost in classification accuracy as tradeoff.

the Euclidean scattering transform, the geometric scattering transform is based
on a cascade of wavelet filters and pointwise nonlinearities. It is invariant
to local isometries and stable to certain types of diffeomorphisms. Empirical
results demonstrate its utility on several geometric learning tasks. Our

electrons is transferred to the mechanical angular momentum of atoms, was
established experimentally in 1915. While a semi-classical explanation of the
effect exists, modern electronic structure methods have not yet been applied to
modelling the phenomenon. In this paper we investigate its microscopic origins
by means of a non-collinear tight-binding model of an $\textrm{O}_2$ dimer,
which includes the effects of spin-orbit coupling, coupling to an external
magnetic field, and vector Stoner exchange. By varying an external magnetic
field in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, a torque can be generated on the
dimer, validating the presence of the EdH effect. Avoided energy level
crossings and the rate of change of magnetic field determine the evolution of
the spin. We find also that the torque exerted on the nuclei by the electrons
in a time-varying $B$ field is not only due to the EdH effect. Other
contributions arise from field-induced changes in the electronic orbital
angular momentum and from the direct action of the Faraday electric field
associated with the time-varying magnetic field.

binary system from that of a single supermassive black hole accreting at the

from near the ISCOs of the black holes. However, there are two possible signals
that can distinctively mark binaries, both arising from the gap formed in
circumbinary accretion flows inside approximately twice the binary separation.
One of these is a ""notch"" cut into the thermal spectra of these systems in the
IR/optical/UV, the other a periodically-varying excess hard X-ray luminosity
whose period is of order the binary orbital period. Using data from detailed
galaxy evolution simulations, we estimate the distribution function in mass,
mass ratio, and accretion rate for accreting supermassive black hole binaries
as a function of redshift and then transform this distribution function into
predicted source counts for these two potential signals. At flux levels

with an internal variable is adopted, which is simplified to a 1D system of two
strains in three regions (austenite, martensite and phase transition regions).
Suitable boundary conditions and interface conditions are proposed.
Theoretically, it is a free boundary problem, as the position and shape of
phase interfaces are unknown. We then focus on planar interfaces (which are
energetically favored), and a symmetric case when phase transition occurs in
the middle. For given applied stress, two-region solutions, three-region
solutions and the connecting solutions between them are obtained analytically
or semi-analytically, including many period-k solutions.
  Two-region solutions show that phase transition does not take place at one
point, but simultaneously in a small region. The width of phase transition
region is found analytically, revealing the roles of the material and
geometrical parameters. Three-region solutions represent localized
inhomogeneous deformations in experiments, and capture that the stress stays
almost at the Maxwell stress during propagation of transformation front. For
displacement-controlled process, the transition process is demonstrated by the
stress-strain curve, which captures the stress drop/rise and the transition
from homogeneous deformations to period-1 localized inhomogeneous deformations.
When the radius is smaller than a critical value (given by material constants),
the stress drop is very sharp due to transition of solutions in a snap-back
bifurcation. These features show good agreement with experimental observations
and shed light on the difficulties of numerical simulations.

similar to a generalized Chance-Constrained AC-OPF (CC-AC-OPF) of the type
recently discussed in the literature, but conceptually different as it

of receivers in multistatic configuration. Unlike standard Wirtinger Flow, GWF
theory guarantees exact recovery for arbitrary lifted forward models that
satisfy the restricted isometry property over rank-1, positive semi-definite

this end, we design a deterministic, lifted forward model for interferometric

complexity for exact multistatic radar imaging via GWF. We provide a numerical
study of our RIC and pixel spacing bounds, which shows that GWF can achieve
exact recovery with super-resolution. While our primary interest lies in radar
imaging, our method is also applicable to other multistatic wave-based imaging

describe in detail the corresponding artificial neural network architecture,
the training process, and report on excessive over-the-air measurement results.
We employ the end-to-end training approach with an autoencoder model that
includes a channel model in the middle layers as previously proposed in the
literature. In contrast to other state-of-the-art results, our architecture
supports learning time synchronization without any manually designed signal
processing operations. Moreover, the neural transceiver has been tested over
the air with an implementation in software defined radio. Our experimental
results for the implemented single antenna system demonstrate a raw bit-rate of
0.5 million bits per second. This exceeds results from comparable systems
presented in the literature and suggests the feasibility of high throughput
deep learning transceivers.

interstellar dust emission at 353 GHz recently raised new questions on the
impact of Galactic foregrounds to the detection of the polarization of the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and on the physical properties of the
interstellar medium (ISM). In the diffuse ISM a clear E-B asymmetry is
observed, with twice as much power in E modes than in B modes; as well as a
positive correlation between the total power, T, and both E and B modes,
presently interpreted in terms of the link between the structure of
interstellar matter and that of the Galactic magnetic field. In this paper we
aim at extending the Planck analysis of the high-latitude sky to low Galactic
latitude, investigating the correlation between the TEB power spectra with the
gas column density from the diffuse ISM to molecular clouds. We divide the sky
between Galactic latitude |b|>5 deg and |b|<60 deg in 552 circular patches and
we study the cross-correlations between the TEB power spectra and the column
density of each patch using the latest release of the Planck polarization data.
We find that the B-to-E power ratio (BB/EE) and the TE correlation ratio (rTE)
depend on column density. While the former increases going from the diffuse ISM
to molecular clouds in the Gould Belt, the latter decreases. This systematic
variation must be related to actual changes in ISM properties. The data show
significant scatter about this mean trend. The variations of BB/EE and rTE are
observed to be anti-correlated for all column densities. In the diffuse ISM,
the variance of these two ratios is consistent with a stochastic non-Gaussian
model in which the values of BB/EE and rTE are fixed. We finally discuss the
dependencies of TB and EB with column density, which are however hampered by
instrumental noise.

  Extensions to Non-convex Functions and Consistent Discretization","Under review. 10 pages, 1 figure",,,,"cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed optimization has gained significant attention in recent years,
primarily fueled by the availability of a large amount of data and
privacy-preserving requirements. This paper presents a fixed-time convergent
optimization algorithm for solving a potentially non-convex optimization
problem using a first-order multi-agent system. Each agent in the network can
access only its private objective function, while local information exchange is
permitted between the neighbors. The proposed optimization algorithm combines a
fixed-time convergent distributed parameter estimation scheme with a fixed-time
distributed consensus scheme as its solution methodology. The results are
presented under the assumption that the team objective function is strongly
convex, as opposed to the common assumptions in the literature requiring each
of the local objective functions to be strongly convex. The results extend to
the class of possibly non-convex team objective functions satisfying only the
Polyak-\L ojasiewicz (PL) inequality. It is also shown that the proposed
continuous-time scheme, when discretized using Euler's method, leads to
consistent discretization, i.e., the fixed-time convergence behavior is
preserved under discretization. Numerical examples comprising large-scale
distributed linear regression and training of neural networks corroborate our
theoretical analysis.

distinct noisy images are available for training a denoiser, and no information
about noise is known, except for it being zero-mean, additive, and independent
of the clean image. In such a setting, which often occurs in practice, it is
not possible to train a denoiser with the standard discriminative training or
with the recently developed Noise2Noise (N2N) training; the former requires the
underlying clean image for the given noisy image, and the latter requires two
independently realized noisy image pair for a clean image. To that end, we
propose GAN2GAN (Generated-Artificial-Noise to Generated-Artificial-Noise)
method that first learns a generative model that can 1) simulate the noise in
the given noisy images and 2) generate a rough, noisy estimates of the clean
images, then 3) iteratively trains a denoiser with subsequently synthesized
noisy image pairs (as in N2N), obtained from the generative model. In results,
we show the denoiser trained with our GAN2GAN achieves an impressive denoising
performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets for the blind denoising
setting; it almost approaches the performance of the standard
discriminatively-trained or N2N-trained models that have more information than
ours, and it significantly outperforms the recent baseline for the same
setting, \textit{e.g.}, Noise2Void, and a more conventional yet strong one,
BM3D. The official code of our method is available at

correlate with the masses of their bulges. This may indicate that the black

formed motivates much of extragalactic astronomy. Here we focus on a population
of galaxies with active black holes in their nuclei (active galactic nuclei or
AGN), that are fully or partially hidden by dust and gas: the emission from the
broad line region is either completely or partially obscured with a visual
extinction of 1 or above. This limit, though not yet precise, appears to be the
point at which the populations of AGN may evolve differently. We highlight the
importance of finding and studying those dusty AGN at redshifts between 1 and
3, the epoch when the universe may have gone through its most dramatic changes.
We emphasize the need for future large multiplexed spectroscopic instruments
that can perform dedicated surveys in the optical and NIR to pin down the
demographics of such objects and study their reddening properties,
star-formation histories, and excitation conditions. These key studies will
shed light on the role of black holes in galaxy evolution during the epoch of

  Framework Using Sequential Test and Adaptive Experimental Design",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During the rapid development cycle for Internet products (websites and mobile
apps), new features are developed and rolled out to users constantly. Features
with code defects or design flaws can cause outages and significant degradation
of user experience. The traditional method of code review and change management
can be time-consuming and error-prone. In order to make the feature rollout
process safe and fast, this paper proposes a methodology for rolling out
features in an automated way using an adaptive experimental design. Under this
framework, a feature is gradually ramped up from a small proportion of users to
a larger population based on real-time evaluation of the performance of
important metrics. If there are any regression detected during the ramp-up
step, the ramp-up process stops and the feature developer is alerted. There are
two main algorithm components powering this framework: 1) a continuous
monitoring algorithm - using a variant of the sequential probability ratio test
(SPRT) to monitor the feature performance metrics and alert feature developers
when a metric degradation is detected, 2) an automated ramp-up algorithm -
deciding when and how to ramp up to the next stage with larger sample size.
This paper presents one monitoring algorithm and three ramping up algorithms
including time-based, power-based, and risk-based (a Bayesian approach)
schedules. These algorithms are evaluated and compared on both simulated data
and real data. There are three benefits provided by this framework for feature
rollout: 1) for defective features, it can detect the regression early and
reduce negative effect, 2) for healthy features, it rolls out the feature
quickly, 3) it reduces the need for manual intervention via the automation of
the feature rollout process.

this paper, we aim to solve both problems. Specifically, first, we propose a

higher efficiency. Finally, we exploit synthetic data and two large social

(AFL), one of the best grey-box fuzzers, is inefficient when fuzz-testing
source-unavailable programs. AFL's binary-only fuzzing mode, QEMU-AFL, is
typically 2-5X slower than its source-available fuzzing mode. The slowdown is
largely caused by the heavy dynamic instrumentation. Recent fuzzing techniques
use Intel Processor Tracing (PT), a light-weight tracing feature supported by
recent Intel CPUs, to remove the need of dynamic instrumentation. However, we
found that these PT-based fuzzing techniques are even slower than QEMU-AFL when
fuzzing real-world programs, making them less effective than QEMU-AFL. This
poor performance is caused by the slow extraction of code coverage information
from highly compressed PT traces.
  In this work, we present the design and implementation of PTrix, which fully
unleashes the benefits of PT for fuzzing via three novel techniques. First,
PTrix introduces a scheme to highly parallel the processing of PT trace and
target program execution. Second, it directly takes decoded PT trace as
feedback for fuzzing, avoiding the expensive reconstruction of code coverage
information. Third, PTrix maintains the new feedback with stronger feedback
than edge-based code coverage, which helps reach new code space and defects
that AFL may not. We evaluated PTrix by comparing its performance with the
state-of-the-art fuzzers. Our results show that, given the same amount of time,
PTrix achieves a significantly higher fuzzing speed and reaches into code
regions missed by the other fuzzers. In addition, PTrix identifies 35 new
vulnerabilities in a set of previously well-fuzzed binaries, showing its
ability to complement existing fuzzers.

divisors. In this paper, inspired by a nice work of Tang et al. on constructing
large classes of bent functions from known bent functions [27, IEEE TIT,
63(10): 6149-6157, 2017], we consider the construction of vectorial bent and
vectorial plateaued $(n,m)$-functions of the form $H(x)=G(x)+g(x)$, where
$G(x)$ is a vectorial bent $(n,m)$-function, and $g(x)$ is a Boolean function
over $\mathbb{F}_{2^{n}}$. We find an efficient generic method to construct
vectorial bent and vectorial plateaued functions of this form by establishing a
link between the condition on the second-order derivatives and the key
condition given by [27]. This allows us to provide (at least) three new
infinite families of vectorial bent functions with high algebraic degrees. New
vectorial plateaued $(n,m+t)$-functions are also obtained ($t\geq 0$ depending
on $n$ can be taken as a very large number), two classes of which have the
maximal number of bent components.

observations at low redshift distances can be used to constrain the Hubble
constant independently. Secondly, the angular size of shadows of high redshift
black holes is increased due to cosmic expansion and may also be reachable with
future observations. This would allow us to probe the cosmic expansion history
for the redshift range elusive to other distance measurements. Additionally,

defending against gradient-based adversarial attacks. Instead of using popular
activation functions (such as ReLU), we advocate the use of k-Winners-Take-All
(k-WTA) activation, a C0 discontinuous function that purposely invalidates the
neural network model's gradient at densely distributed input data points. The
proposed k-WTA activation can be readily used in nearly all existing networks
and training methods with no significant overhead. Our proposal is
theoretically rationalized. We analyze why the discontinuities in k-WTA
networks can largely prevent gradient-based search of adversarial examples and
why they at the same time remain innocuous to the network training. This
understanding is also empirically backed. We test k-WTA activation on various
network structures optimized by a training method, be it adversarial training
or not. In all cases, the robustness of k-WTA networks outperforms that of
traditional networks under white-box attacks.

related to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of interacting bosons. However,
even at zero temperature, when one would expect the whole bosonic quantum
liquid to become condensed, a fraction of it is excited into higher momentum
states via interparticle interactions and quantum fluctuations -- the
phenomenon of quantum depletion. Quantum depletion of weakly interacting atomic
BECs in thermal equilibrium is well understood theoretically but is difficult
to measure. This is even more challenging in driven-dissipative systems such as
exciton-polariton condensates(photons coupled to electron-hole pairs in a
semiconductor), since their nonequilibrium nature is predicted to suppress
quantum depletion. Here, we observe quantum depletion of an optically trapped
high-density exciton-polariton condensate by directly detecting the spectral
branch of elementary excitations populated by this process. Analysis of the
population of this branch in momentum space shows that quantum depletion of an
exciton-polariton condensate can closely follow or strongly deviate from the
equilibrium Bogoliubov theory, depending on the fraction of matter (exciton) in
an exciton-polariton. Our results reveal the effects of exciton-polariton
interactions beyond the mean-field description and call for a deeper
understanding of the relationship between equilibrium and nonequilibrium BECs.

  Detection Using Deep Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.CR cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Malware detection is an ever-present challenge for all organizational
gatekeepers, who must maintain high detection rates while minimizing
interruptions to the organization's workflow. To improve detection rates,
organizations often deploy an ensemble of detectors. While effective, this
approach is computationally expensive, since every file - even clear-cut cases
- needs to be analyzed by all detectors. Moreover, with an ever-increasing
number of files to process, the use of ensembles may incur unacceptable
processing times and costs (e.g., cloud resources). In this study, we propose
SPIREL, a reinforcement learning-based method for cost-effective malware
detection. Our method enables organizations to directly associate costs to
correct/incorrect classification, computing resources and run-time, and then
dynamically establishes a security policy. This security policy is then
implemented, and for each inspected file, a different set of detectors is
assigned and a different detection threshold is set. Our evaluation on two
malware domains- Portable Executable (PE) and Android Application Package
(APK)files - shows that SPIREL is both accurate and extremely
resource-efficient: the proposed method either outperforms the best performing
baselines while achieving a modest improvement in efficiency, or reduces the
required running time by ~80% while decreasing the accuracy and F1-score by
only 0.5%. We also show that our approach is both highly transferable across
different datasets and adaptable to changes in individual detector performance.

survived numerous attacks. The protocols making up Bitcoin must therefore
accommodate the growth of the network and ensure security. Security of the
Bitcoin network depends on connectivity between the nodes. Higher connectivity
yields better security. In this paper we make two observations: (1) current
connectivity in the Bitcoin network is too low for optimal security; (2) at the
same time, increasing connectivity will substantially increase the bandwidth
used by the transaction dissemination protocol, making it prohibitively
expensive to operate a Bitcoin node. Half of the total bandwidth needed to
operate a Bitcoin node is currently used to just announce transactions. Unlike
block relay, transaction dissemination has received little attention in prior
work. We propose a new transaction dissemination protocol, Erlay, that not only
reduces the bandwidth consumption by 40% assuming current connectivity, but
also keeps the bandwidth use almost constant as the connectivity increases. In
contrast, the existing protocol increases the bandwidth consumption linearly
with the number of connections. By allowing more connections at a small cost,
Erlay improves the security of the Bitcoin network. And, as we demonstrate,
Erlay also hardens the network against attacks that attempt to learn the origin
node of a transaction. Erlay is currently being investigated by the Bitcoin
community for future use with the Bitcoin protocol.

it (obtained by introducing a matrix decomposition on the presumed covariance
matrix of the desired signal) has been well studied in the literature.
Different from the existing literature, herein however the original beamforming
problem is tackled. Resorting to the strong duality of linear conic
programming, the robust adaptive beamforming problem for general-rank signal
model is reformulated into an equivalent quadratic matrix inequality (QMI)
problem. By employing a linear matrix inequality (LMI) relaxation technique,
the QMI problem is turned into a convex semidefinite programming problem. Using
the fact that there is often a positive gap between the QMI problem and its LMI
relaxation, an approximate algorithm is proposed to solve the robust adaptive
beamforming in the QMI form. Besides, several sufficient optimality conditions
for the nonconvex QMI problem are built. To validate our results, simulation
examples are presented, which also demonstrate the improved performance of the
new robust beamformer in terms of the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise

The proposed gate structure enables probabilistic modeling on the gates within

some new classes of multicone graphs determinable by their spectra, such as:
$K_v \bigtriangledown O_k$, $K_v \bigtriangledown mO_k$, $K_v \bigtriangledown
\Box_n$ and $K_v \bigtriangledown m\Box_n$, where $O_k$ denoted the Odd graph
$O_{d+1}$ and, $\Box_n$ denoted the folded $2d+1$ cube.
  Also, the notation of the folded graph of $2.O_k$ will be defined and denoted
by $F(2.O_k)$. Moreover, we study some algebraic properties of the graph
$F(2.O_k)$, in fact we show that $F(2.O_k)$ is an integral graph.

yet important task due to the possibly large distinctions between different

proposes a novel unsupervised domain adaption framework which transfers
discriminative representations from the labeled source domain (dataset) to the
unlabeled target domain (dataset). We propose to formulate the domain adaption
task as an one-class classification problem with a novel domain similarity
loss. Given the feature map of any image from a backbone network, a novel
domain adaptive attention model (DAAM) first automatically learns to separate
the feature map of an image to a domain-shared feature (DSH) map and a
domain-specific feature (DSP) map simultaneously. Specially, the residual
attention mechanism is designed to model DSP feature map for avoiding negative
transfer. Then, a DSH branch and a DSP branch are introduced to learn DSH and
DSP feature maps respectively. To reduce domain divergence caused by that the
source and target datasets are collected from different environments, we force
to project the DSH feature maps from different domains to a new nominal domain,
and a novel domain similarity loss is proposed based on one-class
classification. In addition, a novel unsupervised person Re-ID loss is proposed
to take full use of unlabeled target data. Extensive experiments on the

continuous transformation of Shannon and R\'enyi entropies, have intensively
been studied in previous decades. Although their mathematical structure has
thoroughly been explored and established by GSK axioms, the analysis of their
thermostatistical properties have mostly been limited to special cases which
belong to two parameter Sharma-Mittal entropy class, such as Tsallis, Renyi and
Gaussian entropies.
  In this paper we present a general analysis of SPA entropies thermostatistics
by taking into account both linear and escort constraints on internal energy.
We develop two types of dualities between the thermostatistics formalisms. By
the first one, the formalism of R\'enyi entropy is transformed in the formalism
of SPA entropy under general energy constraint and, by the second one, the
generalized thermostatistics which corresponds to the linear constraint is
transformed into the one which corresponds to the escort constraint. Thus, we
establish the equivalence between four different thermostatistics formalisms
based on R\'enyi and SPA entropies coupled with linear and escort constraints
and we provide the transformation formulas. In this way we obtain a general
framework which is applicable to the wide class of entropies and constraints
previously discussed in the literature.
  As an example, we rederive maximum entropy distributions for Sharma-Mittal
entropy and we establish new relationships between the corresponding
thermodynamic potentials. We obtain, as special cases, previously developed
expressions for maximum entropy distributions and thermodynamic quantities for
Tsallis, R\'enyi and Gaussian entropies. In addition, the results are applied
for derivation of thermostatistical relationships for supra-extensive entropy,
which has not previously been considered.

Huygens' metasurfaces, both phase and amplitude of the incoming wave remain
unperturbed at the resonant frequency and, consequently, our metasurface
totally operates in the invisibility regime. We prove experimentally, for the
microwave frequency range, that both phase and amplitude of the transmitted

both numerically and experimentally and explain theoretically in detail a novel

resonant response of the dielectric metasurfaces placed in the vicinity of a

completely swamped by the large and uncontrolled instrumental drift. In this

Furthermore, we have developed a generic algorithm that uses iodine exposures
to extract the stellar radial velocities without the need for the complex
forward modeling. Our algorithm is not accurate to the level of traditional
iodine technique. However it is convenient to use on a low-cost general-purpose

frictional contacts. Compared with standard discrete methods for frictional
contacts, the phase-field method has two attractive features: (1) it can
represent arbitrary crack geometry without an explicit function or basis
enrichment, and (2) it does not require an algorithm for imposing contact
constraints. The first feature, which is common in phase-field models of
fracture, is attained by regularizing a sharp interface geometry using a
surface density functional. The second feature, which is a unique advantage for
contact problems, is achieved by a new approach that calculates the stress
tensor in the regularized interface region depending on the contact condition
of the interface. Particularly, under a slip condition, this approach updates
stress components in the slip direction using a standard contact constitutive
law, while making other stress components compatible with stress in the bulk
region to ensure non-penetrating deformation in other directions. We verify the
proposed phase-field method using stationary interface problems simulated by
discrete methods in the literature. Subsequently, by allowing the phase field
to evolve according to brittle fracture theory, we demonstrate the proposed
method's capability for modeling crack growth with frictional contact.

been proposed. All clustering methods have inherent merits and deficiencies.
Therefore, they are only capable of clustering some specific types of data
robustly. In addition, the accuracies of the clustering methods rely heavily on
the characteristics of the data. In this paper, we propose a new clustering
method based on the morphological operations. The morphological dilation is
used to connect the data points based on their adjacency and form different
connected domains. The iteration of the morphological dilation process stops
when the number of connected domains equals the number of the clusters or when
the maximum number of iteration is reached. The morphological dilation is then
used to label the connected domains. The Euclidean distance between each data
point and the points in each labeled connected domain is calculated. For each
data point, there is a labeled connected domain that contains a point that
yields the smallest Euclidean distance. The data point is assigned with the
same labeling number as the labeled connected domain. We evaluate and compare
the proposed method with state of the art clustering methods with different
types of data. Experimental results show that the proposed method is more
robust and generic for clustering two-dimensional or three-dimensional data.

applications has been discovered. In contrast, higher-order correlation
functions have so far only been used to reveal the nonclassical character of
the emitted fields. In this paper, we study the relation between the
$k$th-order correlation function $g^{(k)}(0)$ and the projection of the
underlying quantum state of light onto the subspace of Fock states with photon
number less than $k$. We show, that when $g^{(k)}(0)$ falls below a critical
value, lower bounds for the projection on this subspace can be concluded as
well as on the ratio of the subspace with one upto $k-1$ photons and $k$ to
infinity. These bounds are at face value only valid for nonclassical quantum
states. However, when the quantum state includes a nonzero projection on the
vacuum state, the value of $g^{(k)}(0)$ is artificially enhanced, potentially
covering these projections. We derive an effective $k$th-order correlation
function, which accounts for the effect of vacuum. We show that the information
gained from the effective correlation function is not limited to nonclassical
quantum states and thus constitute a quantum- and classical application of
higher-order correlation functions.

intensively for well over a century, initiated by groundbreaking mathematicians

theory of diffraction (GTD) in the middle of the last century, and other
important mathematicians such as Fock and Babich. This has led to a very wide
variety of approaches to be developed in order to tackle such two and three
dimensional diffraction problems, with the purpose of obtaining elegant and
compact analytic solutions capable of easy numerical evaluation.
  The purpose of this review article is to showcase the disparate mathematical
techniques that have been proposed. For ease of exposition, mathematical
brevity, and for the broadest interest to the reader, all approaches are aimed
at one canonical model, namely diffraction of a monochromatic scalar plane wave
by a two-dimensional wedge with perfect Dirichlet or Neumann boundaries. The
first three approaches offered are those most commonly used today in
diffraction theory, although not necessarily in the context of wedge
diffraction. These are the Sommerfeld-Malyuzhinets method, the Wiener-Hopf
technique, and the Kontorovich-Lebedev transform approach. Then follows three
less well-known and somewhat novel methods, which would be of interest even to
specialists in the field, namely the embedding method, a random walk approach,
and the technique of functionally-invariant solutions.
  Having offered the exact solution of this problem in a variety of forms, a
numerical comparison between the exact solution and several powerful
approximations such as GTD is performed and critically assessed.

Specifically, our RFA-LCF uses a L2,1-norm based flexible residue to encode the
mismatch between clean data and its reconstruction, and also applies the robust
adaptive sparse local-coordinate coding to represent the data using a few
nearby basis concepts, which can make the factorization more accurate and
robust to noise. The robust flexible factorization is also performed in the
recovered clean data space for enhancing representations. RFA-LCF also
considers preserving the local manifold structures of clean data space, basis

mobile users are less likely to click on them, expecting to get the answer
directly from the snippets. In turn, this has revived the interest in Question
Answering. Then, along came chatbots, conversational systems, and messaging
platforms, where the user needs could be better served with the system asking
follow-up questions in order to better understand the user's intent. While
typically a user would expect a single response at any utterance, a system
could also return multiple options for the user to select from, based on
different system understandings of the user's intent. However, this possibility

How to produce good variable-length lists, given the conflicting objectives of
staying short while maximizing the likelihood of having a correct answer

evaluate a system that tries to do that. Here we aim to bridge this gap. In
particular, we define some necessary and some optional properties that an
evaluation measure fit for this purpose should have. We further show that
existing evaluation measures from the IR tradition are not entirely suitable

clustering methods are specified procedurally, rather than in terms of the cost
function to be optimized. We aim to overcome this limitation by presenting a
general optimization framework for ultrametric fitting. Our approach consists
of modeling the latter as a constrained optimization problem over the
continuous space of ultrametrics. So doing, we can leverage the simple, yet
effective, idea of replacing the ultrametric constraint with a min-max
operation injected directly into the cost function. The proposed reformulation
leads to an unconstrained optimization problem that can be efficiently solved
by gradient descent methods. The flexibility of our framework allows us to
investigate several cost functions, following the classic paradigm of combining
a data fidelity term with a regularization. While we provide no theoretical
guarantee to find the global optimum, the numerical results obtained over a
number of synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the good performance of our
approach with respect to state-of-the-art agglomerative algorithms. This makes
us believe that the proposed framework sheds new light on the way to design a

time-consuming sparse reconstruction process with the well-trained dictionary

the complementary data matrix to learn the sub-dictionary over each class. To
enhance the performance, we incorporate a locality constraint of atoms into the
DL procedures to keep local information and obtain the codes of samples over
each class separately. A block-diagonal discriminative approximation term is
also derived to learn a discriminative projection to bridge data with their
codes by extracting the special block-diagonal features from data, which can
ensure the approximate coefficients to associate with its label information
clearly. Then, a robust multiclass classifier is trained over extracted
block-diagonal codes for accurate label predictions. Experimental results

ability over CF by incorporating label information as additional constraints,

difference between the original data and its reconstruction directly can enable
CCF to model a small noisy perturbation, but is not robust to gross sparse

representation space explicitly, especially in an adaptive manner. In this
paper, we propose a joint label prediction based Robust Semi-Supervised
Adaptive Concept Factorization (RS2ACF) framework. To obtain robust
representation, RS2ACF relaxes the factorization to make it simultaneously
stable to small entrywise noise and robust to sparse errors. To enrich prior
knowledge to enhance the discrimination, RS2ACF clearly uses class information
of labeled data and more importantly propagates it to unlabeled data by jointly
learning an explicit label indicator for unlabeled data. By the label
indicator, RS2ACF can ensure the unlabeled data of the same predicted label to
be mapped into the same class in feature space. Besides, RS2ACF incorporates
the joint neighborhood reconstruction error over the new representations and
predicted labels of both labeled and unlabeled data, so the manifold structures
can be preserved explicitly and adaptively in the representation space and
label space at the same time. Owing to the adaptive manner, the tricky process
of determining the neighborhood size or kernel width can be avoided. Extensive
results on public databases verify that our RS2ACF can deliver state-of-the-art
data representation, compared with other related methods.

hand-crafted feature extraction. However, the deep neural network currently
faces many challenges: 1) its effectiveness is heavily dependent on large
datasets, so the computational complexity is very high; 2) it is usually
regarded as a black box model with poor interpretability. To meet the above
challenges, a more interpretable and scalable feature learning method, i.e.,
deep image feature learning with fuzzy rules (DIFL-FR), is proposed in the
paper, which combines the rule-based fuzzy modeling technique and the deep
stacked learning strategy. The method progressively learns image features
through a layer-by-layer manner based on fuzzy rules, so the feature learning
process can be better explained by the generated rules. More importantly, the
learning process of the method is only based on forward propagation without
back propagation and iterative learning, which results in the high learning
efficiency. In addition, the method is under the settings of unsupervised
learning and can be easily extended to scenes of supervised and semi-supervised
learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on image datasets of different
scales. The results obviously show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

rely on large datasets, which are time-consuming to annotate. These datasets
are typically annotated in two stages: (1) determining the presence of object
classes at the image level and (2) marking the spatial extent for all objects
of these classes. In this work we use speech, together with mouse inputs, to
speed up this process. We first improve stage one, by letting annotators
indicate object class presence via speech. We then combine the two stages:
annotators draw an object bounding box via the mouse and simultaneously provide
its class label via speech. Using speech has distinct advantages over relying
on mouse inputs alone. First, it is fast and allows for direct access to the
class name, by simply saying it. Second, annotators can simultaneously speak
and mark an object location. Finally, speech-based interfaces can be kept
extremely simple, hence using them requires less mouse movement compared to
existing approaches. Through extensive experiments on the COCO and ILSVRC
datasets we show that our approach yields high-quality annotations at
significant speed gains. Stage one takes 2.3x - 14.9x less annotation time than
existing methods based on a hierarchical organization of the classes to be
annotated. Moreover, when combining the two stages, we find that object class
labels come for free: annotating them at the same time as bounding boxes has
zero additional cost. On COCO, this makes the overall process 1.9x faster than
the two-stage approach.

suggested approach is based on randomized matrix decomposition methods,
combined with the fast multipole method to achieve an algorithm that can
process large datasets in complexity linear to the number of data points. In
addition, a detailed theoretical analysis is provided, including an upper bound
to the condition number. Finally, for Gaussian kernels, the analysis shows that
the required rank for a desired condition number can be determined directly
from the dataset itself without performing any analysis on the kernel matrix.

Gaia data. The stream was claimed to be $\approx$1 Gyr old, which would make it
an exceptional discovery for stellar astrophysics, as star clusters of that age
are rare and tend to be distant, limiting their utility as benchmark samples.
We test this old age for Psc-Eri in two ways. First, we compare the rotation
periods for 101 low-mass members (measured using time series photometry from
the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, TESS) to those of well-studied open
clusters. Second, we identify 34 new high-mass candidate members, including the
notable stars $\lambda$ Tauri (an Algol-type eclipsing binary) and HD 1160
(host to a directly imaged object near the hydrogen-burning limit). We conduct
an isochronal analysis of the color--magnitude data for these highest-mass
members, again comparing our results to those for open clusters. Both analyses
show that the stream has an age consistent with that of the Pleiades, i.e.,
$\approx$120 Myr. This makes the Psc-Eri stream an exciting source of young
benchmarkable stars and, potentially, exoplanets located in a more diffuse
environment that is distinct from that of the Pleiades and of other dense star
clusters.

Most of the

samples and features simultaneously. To take advantage of two-sided clustering
for the co-occurrences in the scene of multi-view clustering, a two-sided
multi-view clustering method is proposed, i.e., multi-view
information-theoretic co-clustering (MV-ITCC). The proposed method realizes
two-sided clustering for co-occurring multi-view data under the formulation of
information theory. More specifically, it exploits the agreement and
disagreement among views by sharing a common clustering results along the
sample dimension and keeping the clustering results of each view specific along
the feature dimension. In addition, the mechanism of maximum entropy is also
adopted to control the importance of different views, which can give a right
balance in leveraging the agreement and disagreement. Extensive experiments are
conducted on text and image multi-view datasets. The results clearly
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

methods by focusing exclusively on attributes of the target object. When it
comes to human perceptual learning approaches, these physical qualities are not
only inferred from the object, but also from the characteristics of the
surroundings. This work proposes a method that includes environmental context
to reason on an object affordance to then deduce its grasping regions. This
affordance is reasoned using a ranked association of visual semantic attributes
harvested in a knowledge base graph representation. The framework is assessed
using standard learning evaluation metrics and the zero-shot affordance
prediction scenario. The resulting grasping areas are compared with unseen
labelled data to asses their accuracy matching percentage. The outcome of this
evaluation suggest the autonomy capabilities of the proposed method for object

language models (LM). It claims that teacher forcing would cause the test-time
generation to be incrementally distorted due to the training-generation
discrepancy. Although a lot of algorithms have been proposed to avoid teacher
forcing and therefore alleviate exposure bias, there is little work showing how
serious the exposure bias problem actually is. In this work, we focus on the
task of open-ended language generation, propose metrics to quantify the impact
of exposure bias in the aspects of quality, diversity, and consistency. Our key
intuition is that if we feed ground-truth data prefixes (instead of prefixes
generated by the model itself) into the model and ask it to continue the
generation, the performance should become much better because the
training-generation discrepancy in the prefix is removed. Both automatic and
human evaluations are conducted in our experiments. On the contrary to the
popular belief in exposure bias, we find that the the distortion induced by the
prefix discrepancy is limited, and does not seem to be incremental during the
generation. Moreover, our analysis reveals an interesting self-recovery ability
of the LM, which we hypothesize to be countering the harmful effects from
exposure bias.

augment our learned text-visual semantic representation with scene text cues,
to mitigate vocabulary misses that may have occurred during the semantic

also apply query-based attention to our text channel. We show how the

to evaluate the impacts of the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017 on two
real-world grid-tied PV systems (1.4MW and 355kW) in Miami and Daytona,
Florida, the feeders they are connected to, and the management areas they

picture of the impacts using 1-minute PV generation data, hourly weather data,
real feeder parameters, and daily reliability data. These analyses include:
individual PV system performance measurement using power performance index;
power quality analysis at the point of interconnection; a study on the
operation of voltage regulating devices on the feeders during eclipse peak
using an IEEE 8500 test case distribution feeder; and reliability study
involving a multilayer perceptron framework for forecasting system reliability
of the management areas. Results from this study provide a unique insight into
how solar eclipses impact the behavior of PV systems and the grid, which would

~ -0.4 eV, shows features that are consistent with well studied 2-D silicenes.
The bonding in this new structure as well as its physical nature are
fundamentally different from the covalent surface bonding that is widely

significant sp2-sp3 hybridization in the top layer that creates a 'faulted'
honeycomb motif of Si atoms. This top layer has an unusual periodic p-orbital
structure that can inter-digitate with the terminal bulk 'dangling bonds' to
create a 2-D pi-bonded structure. This unusual bonding and new structure is
important in understanding the nature of 2-D silicenes and 1-D honeycomb

human development?"" We argue that, as a matter of policy, development should be
limited to one eighth, with the remainder set aside. We argue that adopting a
""1/8 principle"" is far less restrictive, overall, than it might seem. One
eighth of the iron in the asteroid belt is more than a million times greater
than all of the Earth's estimated iron reserves and may suffice for centuries.
A limit of some sort is needed because of the problems associated with
exponential growth. Humans are poor at estimating the pace of such growth, so
the limitations of a resource are hard to recognize before the final three
doubling times which take utilization successively from 1/8 to 1/4 to 1/2, and
then to the point of exhaustion. Population growth and climate change are
instances of unchecked exponential growth. Each places strains upon ouru
available resources. Each is a problem we would like to control but attempts to
do so at this comparatively late stage have not been encouraging. Our limited
ability to see ahead suggests that we should set ourselves a 'tripwire' that
gives us at least 3 doubling times as leeway, i.e. when 1/8 of Solar System
resources are close to being exploited. At a 3.5 percent growth rate for the
space economy, comparable to that of the iron use from the beginning of the
Industrial Revolution until now, the 1/8 point would be reached after 400
years. At that point the 20 year doubling time of a 3.5 percent growth rate
means that only 60 years would remain to transition the economic system to new
""steady state"" conditions. The rationale for adopting the 1/8 principle now is
that it may be far easier to implement in principle restrictions at an early
stage, rather than later, when vested and competing interests have come into
existence.

Due to the nature that inverse KL imposes large penalty on fake-looking

the technology by which a manual task is performed with minimum or zero human
assistance. Over the years, automation has proved to reduce operation cost and
maintenance time in addition to increase system productivity, reliability, and
performance. Today, most computerized automation are done by a computer program
which is a set of instructions executed from within the computer memory by the
computer central processing unit to control the computers various operations.
This paper proposes a compiler program that automates the validation and
translation of input documents written in the Arabic language into XML output
files that can be read by a computer. The input document is by nature
unstructured and in plain-text as it is written by people manually; while, the
generated output is a structured machine-readable XML file. The proposed
compiler program is actually a part of a bigger project related to digital
government and is meant to automate the processing and archiving of juridical
data and documents. In essence, the proposed compiler program is composed of a
scanner, a parser, and a code generator. Experiments showed that such
automation practices could prove to be a starting point for a future digital
government platform for the Lebanese government. As further research, other
types of juridical documents are to be investigated, mainly those that require
error detection and correction.

  speckle contrast in the temporal and spatial domains",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A systematic and robust laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) method and
procedure is presented, covering the LSCI system calibration, static scattering
removal, and measurement noise estimation and correction to obtain a true flow
speckle contrast and the flow speed from single-exposure LSCI measurements. We
advocate to use as the speckle contrast instead of the conventional contrast K
as the former relates simply to the flow velocity and is with additive noise
alone. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed true flow speckle contrast
by imaging phantom flow at varying speeds, showing that (1) the proposed recipe
greatly enhances the linear sensitivity of the flow index (inverse
decorrelation time) and the linearity covers the full span of flow speeds from
0 mm/s to 40 mm/s; and (2) the true flow speed can be recovered regardless of
the overlying static scattering layers and the type of speckle statistics
(temporal or spatial). The fundamental difference between the apparent temporal
and spatial speckle contrasts is further revealed. The flow index recovered in
the spatial domain is much more susceptible to static scattering and exhibit a
shorter linearity range than that obtained in the temporal domain. The proposed
LSCI analysis framework paves the way to estimate the true flow speed in the
wide array of laser speckle contrast imaging applications.

  3, no. 3, pp. 141-146, 2019",,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The evolution of the Internet and computer applications have generated
colossal amount of data. They are referred to as Big Data and they consist of
huge volume, high velocity, and variable datasets that need to be managed at
the right speed and within the right time frame to allow real-time data
processing and analysis. Several Big Data solutions were developed, however
they are all based on distributed computing which can be sometimes expensive to
build, manage, troubleshoot, and secure. This paper proposes a novel method for
processing Big Data using memory-based, multi-processing, and one-server
architecture. It is memory-based because data are loaded into memory prior to
start processing. It is multi-processing because it leverages the power of
parallel programming using shared memory and multiple threads running over
several CPUs in a concurrent fashion. It is one-server because it only requires
a single server that operates in a non-distributed computing environment. The
foremost advantages of the proposed method are high performance, low cost, and
ease of management. The experiments conducted showed outstanding results as the
proposed method outperformed other conventional methods that currently exist on
the market. Further research can improve upon the proposed method so that it
supports message passing between its different processes using remote procedure
calls among other techniques.
