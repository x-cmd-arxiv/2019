  Wei","Network Pruning for Low-Rank Binary Indexing",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pruning is an efficient model compression technique to remove redundancy in
the connectivity of deep neural networks (DNNs). Computations using sparse
matrices obtained by pruning parameters, however, exhibit vastly different
parallelism depending on the index representation scheme. As a result,
fine-grained pruning has not gained much attention due to its irregular index
form leading to large memory footprint and low parallelism for convolutions and
matrix multiplications. In this paper, we propose a new network pruning
technique that generates a low-rank binary index matrix to compress index data
while decompressing index data is performed by simple binary matrix
multiplication. This proposed compression method finds a particular
fine-grained pruning mask that can be decomposed into two binary matrices. We
also propose a tile-based factorization technique that not only lowers memory
requirements but also enhances compression ratio. Various DNN models can be
pruned with much fewer indexes compared to previous sparse matrix formats while
maintaining the same pruning rate.

properties of not only the outer envelope of these stars, but also their deep
layers. Among the seismic parameters associated with mixed modes, the gravity
offset, denoted with $\varepsilon_{\rm g}$, is expected to reveal information
on the boundaries of the inner buoyancy resonant cavity. This parameter was
recently measured for hundreds of stars observed by the Kepler satellite and
its value was shown to change during the evolution on the red giant branch. In
this article, we theoretically investigate the reasons for such a variation in
terms of structure properties. Using available asymptotic analyses and a simple
model of the Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a and Lamb frequencies, we derived an analytical
expression of $\varepsilon_{\rm g}$ for dipolar modes and compared its
predictions to observations. First, we show that the asymptotic value of
$\varepsilon_{\rm g}$ well agrees with the mean value observed at the beginning
of the ascent of the red giant branch, which results from the high density
contrast between the helium core and the base of the convective envelope.
Second, we demonstrate that the predicted value also explains the sharp
decrease in $\varepsilon_{\rm g}$ observed for the more luminous red giant
stars of the sample. This rapid drop turns out to occur just before the
luminosity bump and result from the kink of the Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequency
near the upper turning point associated with the buoyancy cavity as stars
evolve and this latter becomes close to the base of the convective envelope.The
observed variation in $\varepsilon_{\rm g}$ and its link with the internal
properties on the red giant branch are now globally understood. This motivates
further analyses of the potential of this parameter as a seismic diagnosis of
the region located between the helium core and the convective envelope.

polarization data, not included in our previous analysis, pass an extensive

Polarization bispectra display a significant improvement in robustness; they
can now be used independently to set NG constraints. We consider a large number
of additional cases, e.g. scale-dependent feature and resonance bispectra,
isocurvature primordial NG, and parity-breaking models, where we also place
tight constraints but do not detect any signal. The non-primordial lensing
bispectrum is detected with an improved significance compared to 2015,
excluding the null hypothesis at 3.5 sigma. We present model-independent
reconstructions and analyses of the CMB bispectrum. Our final constraint on the
local trispectrum shape is g_NLl^local = (-5.8 +\-6.5) x 10^4 (68%CL,

constrain the parameter space of different early-Universe scenarios, including
general single-field models of inflation, multi-field and axion field

tumour spheroid. This understanding is likely to assist in the development of
better diagnostics, improved therapies and prognostics. In biological systems,
most of the diffusive and convective processes are through cellular membranes
which are porous in nature. Due to its porous nature, diffusive processes in
biological systems are heterogeneous. Fractional advection-diffusion equations
are well suited to model heterogeneous biological systems; though most of the
early studies did not use this fact. They modelled tumour growth with simple
advection-diffusion equation or diffusion equation. We have developed two
spherical models based on fractional advection-diffusion equations: one of
fixed order and the other of variable order for avascular tumour. These two
models are investigated from phenomenological view by measuring some parameters
for characterizing avascular tumour growth over time. It is found that both the
models offer realistic and insightful information for tumour growth at the
macroscopic level, and approximate well the physical phenomena. The fixed-order
model always overestimates clinical data like tumour radius, and tumour volume.
The cell counts in both the models lie in the clinically established range. As
the simulation parameters get modified due to different biochemical and
biophysical processes, the robustness of the model is determined. It is found
that, the sensitivity of the fixed-order model is low while the variable-order
model is moderately sensitive to the parameters.

function without critical points near the boundary such that its critical
points as well as the critical points of its restriction to the boundary are
all non-degenerate. For such Morse functions, Saeki and Yamamoto have
previously defined a certain notion of cusp cobordism, and computed the
unoriented cusp cobordism group of Morse functions on surfaces. In this paper,
we compute unoriented and oriented cusp cobordism groups of Morse functions on
manifolds of any dimension by employing Levine's cusp elimination technique as
well as the complementary process of creating pairs of cusps along fold lines.
We show that both groups are cyclic of order two in even dimensions, and cyclic
of infinite order in odd dimensions. For Morse functions on surfaces our result
yields an explicit description of Saeki-Yamamoto's cobordism invariant which
they constructed by means of the cohomology of the universal complex of

  Methodologies and Practice","PhD thesis, Information and Automation, Roma Tre University",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automated Planning is one of the main research field of Artificial
Intelligence since its beginnings. Research in Automated Planning aims at
developing general reasoners (i.e., planners) capable of automatically solve
complex problems. Broadly speaking, planners rely on a general model
characterizing the possible states of the world and the actions that can be
performed in order to change the status of the world. Given a model and an
initial known state, the objective of a planner is to synthesize a set of
actions needed to achieve a particular goal state. The classical approach to
planning roughly corresponds to the description given above. The timeline-based
approach is a particular planning paradigm capable of integrating causal and
temporal reasoning within a unified solving process. This approach has been
successfully applied in many real-world scenarios although a common
interpretation of the related planning concepts is missing. Indeed, there are
significant differences among the existing frameworks that apply this
technique. Each framework relies on its own interpretation of timeline-based
planning and therefore it is not easy to compare these systems. Thus, the
objective of this work is to investigate the timeline-based approach to
planning by addressing several aspects ranging from the semantics of the
related planning concepts to the modeling and solving techniques. Specifically,
the main contributions of this PhD work consist of: (i) the proposal of a
formal characterization of the timeline-based approach capable of dealing with
temporal uncertainty; (ii) the proposal of a hierarchical modeling and solving
approach; (iii) the development of a general purpose framework for planning and
execution with timelines; (iv) the validation{\dag}of this approach in
real-world manufacturing scenarios.

period of 267 days. At the time of its discovery, it had the longest period of
any small planet in the habitable zone of a multi-planet system. Because of its
long period, only four transits were observed during Kepler's interval of
observations. It was initially missed by the Kepler pipeline, but the first
three transits were identified by an independent search by Eric Agol, and it
was identified as a planet candidate in subsequent Kepler catalogs. However in
the latest catalog of exoplanets (Thompson et al., 2018), it is labeled as a
false positive. Recent exoplanet catalogues have evolved from subjective
classification to automatic classifications of planet candidates by algorithms
(such as `Robovetter'). While exceptionally useful for producing a uniform
catalogue, these algorithms sometimes misclassify planet candidates as a false
positive, as is the case of Kepler-62f. In particularly valuable cases, i.e.,
when a small planet has been found orbiting in the habitable zone (HZ), it is
important to conduct comprehensive analyses of the data and classification
protocols to provide the best estimate of the true status of the detection. In
this paper we conduct such analyses and show that Kepler-62f is a true planet

that the store buffer - a microarchitectural optimization to reduce the latency
for data stores - in combination with the TLB enables powerful attacks. We
present several ASLRrelated attacks, including a KASLR break from unprivileged

attacks, breaking the atomicity of TSX, and monitoring control flow of the

still possible, and software fixes are still necessary to ensure proper
isolation between the kernel and user space.

from various other microarchitectural structures, including the FPU register

  In this paper, we present the ZombieLoad attack which uncovers a novel
Meltdown-type effect in the processor's previously unexplored fill-buffer
logic. Our analysis shows that faulting load instructions (i.e., loads that
have to be re-issued for either architectural or microarchitectural reasons)
may transiently dereference unauthorized destinations previously brought into
the fill buffer by the current or a sibling logical CPU. Hence, we report data
leakage of recently loaded stale values across logical cores. We demonstrate
ZombieLoad's effectiveness in a multitude of practical attack scenarios across
CPU privilege rings, OS processes, virtual machines, and SGX enclaves. We
discuss both short and long-term mitigation approaches and arrive at the

mixture of liquid nitromethane (NM) and air-filled, circular cavities. The
shock-induced initiation behaviors resulting from the cases with neat NM, NM
with an array of regularly spaced cavities, and NM with randomly distributed
cavities are examined. For the case with randomly distributed cavities,
hundreds of cavities are explicitly resolved in the simulations using a
diffuse-interface approach to treat two immiscible fluids and GPU-enabled
parallel computing. Without invoking any empirically calibrated,
phenomenological models, the reaction rate in the simulations is governed by
Arrhenius kinetics. For the cases with neat NM, the resulting SDT process
features a superdetonation that evolves from a thermal explosion after a delay
following the passage of the incident shock wave and eventually catches up with
the leading shock front. For the cases wherein mesoscale heterogeneities are
explicitly considered, a gradual SDT process is captured. These two distinct
initiation behaviors for neat NM and heterogeneous NM mixtures agree with
experimental findings. Via examining the global reaction rate of the mixture, a
unique time scale characterizing the SDT process, i.e., the overtake time, is
measured for each simulation. For an input shock pressure less than
approximately $9.4~\mathrm{GPa}$, the overtake time resulting from a
heterogeneous mixture is shorter than that for neat NM. This sensitizing effect
is more pronounced for lower input shock pressures. A random distribution of
cavities is found to be more effective in enhancing the SDT process than a
regular array of cavities. Statistical analysis on the meso-resolved simulation
data provides more insights into the mechanism of energy release underlying the
SDT process.

  Learning","To appear in the proceedings of the International Joint Conference on
  Artificial Intelligence 2019 (IJCAI)",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The options framework in reinforcement learning models the notion of a skill
or a temporally extended sequence of actions. The discovery of a reusable set
of skills has typically entailed building options, that navigate to bottleneck
states. This work adopts a complementary approach, where we attempt to discover
options that navigate to landmark states. These states are prototypical
representatives of well-connected regions and can hence access the associated
region with relative ease. In this work, we propose Successor Options, which
leverages Successor Representations to build a model of the state space. The
intra-option policies are learnt using a novel pseudo-reward and the model
scales to high-dimensional spaces easily. Additionally, we also propose an
Incremental Successor Options model that iterates between constructing
Successor Representations and building options, which is useful when robust
Successor Representations cannot be built solely from primitive actions. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a collection of grid-worlds, and on
the high-dimensional robotic control environment of Fetch.

discovering the community structure and link prediction on graph-structured

have also emerged as a promising approach to learn powerful representations
(embeddings) for the nodes in the graph, by exploiting graph properties such as
locality and invariance. In this work, we unify these two directions by
developing a \emph{sparse} variational autoencoder for graphs, that retains the
interpretability of SBMs, while also enjoying the excellent predictive
performance of graph neural nets. Moreover, our framework is accompanied by a
fast recognition model that enables fast inference of the node embeddings

Although we develop this framework for a particular type of SBM, namely the

readily for other types of SBMs. Experimental results on several benchmarks
demonstrate encouraging results on link prediction while learning an

quantum states in order to exploit quantum parallelism. However, this embedding
requires considerable resources. It would therefore be desirable to avoid it,
if possible, for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) implementation.
Accordingly, we consider a classical-quantum hybrid architecture, which allows
large classical input data, with a relatively small-scale quantum system. This
hybrid architecture is used to implement an oracle. It is shown that in the
presence of noise in the hybrid oracle, the effects of internal noise can
cancel each other out and thereby improve the query success rate. It is also
shown that such an immunity of the hybrid oracle to noise directly and tangibly
reduces the sample complexity in the probably-approximately-correct learning
framework. This NISQ-compatible learning advantage is attributed to the
oracle's ability to handle large input features.

disc gravitational instability, and originate from the low galaxy-to-galaxy
variance of Toomre's $Q$ stability parameter. We test such relations using more
than 100 galaxies, from massive spirals to dwarf irregulars, thus spanning
several orders of magnitude in stellar mass
($M_{\star}\approx10^{6\mbox{-}11}\,\mbox{M}_{\odot}$) and atomic gas mass
($M_{\mathrm{HI}}\approx10^{7\mbox{-}10.5}\,\mbox{M}_{\odot}$). Such tests
demonstrate (i) that our scaling relations are physically motivated and tightly
constrained, (ii) that the mass-averaged gravitational instability properties
of galaxy discs are remarkably uniform across the sequence Sa-dIrr, and (iii)
that specific angular momentum plays an important role in such a scenario.
Besides providing new insights into a very important topic in galaxy evolution,
this work provides a simple formula (Eq. 5) that one can use for generating
other galaxy relations driven by disc instability. We explain how to do that,
mention a few possible applications, and stress the importance of testing our

we demonstrate that there is always a geodesic between the identity and the
time evolution operator $e^{-iHt}$ whose length grows linearly with time. This
geodesic is minimal until there is an obstruction to its minimality, after
which it can fail to be a minimum either locally or globally. We identify a
criterion - the Eigenstate Complexity Hypothesis (ECH) - which bounds the
overlap between off-diagonal energy eigenstate projectors and the $k$-local
operators of the theory, and use it to show that the linear geodesic will at

obstructions to linear growth of complexity for exponential time, as expected
from holographic duality. In contrast, we also study the case with $N=2$

These halos would be the densest dark matter structures in the Universe, and
their abundance can probe processes that leave imprints on the primordial
density field, such as inflation or an early matter-dominated era. They can
also probe dark matter through its free-streaming scale. The first halos are
qualitatively different from halos that form by hierarchical clustering, as
evidenced by their $\rho\propto r^{-3/2}$ inner density profiles. In this work,
we present and tune models that predict the density profiles of these halos
from properties of the density peaks from which they collapsed. These models
predict the coefficient $A$ of the $\rho=Ar^{-3/2}$ small-radius asymptote of
the density profile along with the maximum circular velocity $v_\mathrm{max}$
and associated radius $r_\mathrm{max}$. These models are universal; they can be
applied to any cosmology, and we confirm this by validating them using six
$N$-body simulations carried out in wildly disparate cosmological scenarios. We
find that these models can even predict the full population of halos with
reasonable accuracy in scenarios with narrowly supported power spectra,
although for broader power spectra, an understanding of the impact of halo
mergers is needed. With their connection to the primordial density field
established, the first dark matter halos will serve as probes of the early

beams of four ongoing and future interferometers---PAPER, MWA, HERA, and

the HI signal and isolate their impact by making suitable analytic
approximations. The decorrelation time scale of the amplitude of the
correlation function lies in the range of 2--20~minutes for baselines of
interest for the extraction of the HI signal. The phase of the correlation
function can be made small after scaling out an appropriate term, which also
causes the coherence time scale of the phase to be longer than the amplitude of

measure the lensing amplitude by taking the ratio of the measured spectrum to
the expected spectrum from the best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model to the

towards the Poincar\'e horizon, i.e. deep enough into the IR region of the AdS

The exponential suppression is found to occur in the presence of bulk
interactions dressing the AdS propagators. We calculate one-loop gravitational
dressing and find that the suppression effect comes from the scalar component
of the 5d graviton. We then argue that, at least at strong coupling, this
exponential decay censors the region of spacetime where the 5d effective field

usual instantons but should be understood by ""quantum"" instantons, which
saturate the BPS bound between classical action and quantum-induced effective

sensitive to the accuracy of the continuum orbitals. For instance, it is
necessary to account for the direct Coulomb potential of the ion for the

reproduced quite well already with a rather small active space. Finally,

This is an important topic since machine learning software is increasingly

application of that software will result in fairer decisions because (unlike
humans) machine learning software is not biased. However, recent results show
that the software within many data mining packages exhibits ""group

  There has been much prior work on validating the fairness of machine-learning
models (by recognizing when such software discrimination exists). But after
detection, comes mitigation. What steps can ethical software engineers take to
reduce discrimination in the software they produce?
  This paper shows that making \textit{fairness} as a goal during

learned from a data miner while also (b) generates fairer results. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first application of hyperparameter optimization

how the distribution of planets depends on position within the Galaxy. In this
paper, we compare 50 microlens parallax measurements from the 2015 $Spitzer$
campaign to three different Galactic models commonly used in microlensing
analyses, and we find that $\geq 74\%$ of these events have microlensing
parallax values higher than the medians predicted by Galactic models. The
Anderson-Darling tests indicate probabilities of $p_{\rm AD} < 6.6 \times
10^{-5}$ for these three Galactic models, while the binomial probability of
such a large fraction of large microlensing parallax values is $< 4.6\times
10^{-4}$. Given that many $Spitzer$ light curves show evidence of large
correlated errors, we conclude that this discrepancy is probably due to
systematic errors in the $Spitzer$ photometry. We find formally acceptable
probabilities of $p_{\rm AD} > 0.05$ for subsamples of events with bright
source stars ($I_{\rm S} \leq 17.75$) or $Spitzer$ coverage of the light curve
peak. This indicates that the systematic errors have a more serious influence
on faint events, especially when the light curve peak is not covered by
$Spitzer$. We find that multiplying an error bar renormalization factor of 2.2
by the reported error bars on the $Spitzer$ microlensing parallax measurements
provides reasonable agreement with all three Galactic models. However,
corrections to the uncertainties in the $Spitzer$ photometry itself are a more
effective way to address the systematic errors.

In our formulation, a
unitary matrix is represented as a product of rotations in two-dimensional
subspaces, so-called Givens rotations. Instead of the quadratic dimension
dependence when applying a dense matrix, applying such an approximation scales
with the number factors, each of which can be implemented efficiently.
Consequently, in settings where an approximation is once computed and then
applied many times, such a representation becomes advantageous. Although
effective Givens factorization is not possible for generic unitary operators,
we show that minimizing a sparsity-inducing objective with a coordinate descent
algorithm on the unitary group yields good factorizations for structured
matrices. Canonical applications of such a setup are orthogonal basis
transforms. We demonstrate numerical results of approximating the graph Fourier
transform, which is the matrix obtained when diagonalizing a graph Laplacian.

low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) has received considerable
attention, owing to the capability of dramatically reducing the hardware cost.
Besides, it has been shown that the use of low-resolution DACs enable great
reduction in power consumption while maintain the performance loss within
acceptable margin, under the assumption of perfect knowledge of channel state
information (CSI). In this paper, we investigate the precoding problem for the
coarsely quantized MU-MIMO system without such an assumption. The channel
uncertainties are modeled to be a random matrix with finite second-order
statistics. By leveraging a favorable relation between the multi-bit DACs
outputs and the single-bit ones, we first reformulate the original complex
precoding problem into a nonconvex binary optimization problem. Then, using the
S-procedure lemma, the nonconvex problem is recast into a tractable formulation
with convex constraints and finally solved by the semidefinite relaxation (SDR)
method. Compared with existing representative methods, the proposed precoder is
robust to various channel uncertainties and is able to support a MUMIMO system
with higher-order modulations, e.g., 16QAM.

  We consider the problem of automatically establishing that a given
syntax-guided-synthesis (SyGuS) problem is unrealizable (i.e., has no
solution). Existing techniques have quite limited ability to establish
unrealizability for general SyGuS instances in which the grammar describing the
search space contains infinitely many programs. By encoding the synthesis
problem's grammar G as a nondeterministic program P_G, we reduce the
unrealizability problem to a reachability problem such that, if a standard
program-analysis tool can establish that a certain assertion in P_G always
holds, then the synthesis problem is unrealizable.
  Our method can be used to augment any existing SyGus tool so that it can
establish that a successfully synthesized program q is optimal with respect to
some syntactic cost -- e.g., q has the fewest possible if-then-else operators.
Using known techniques, grammar G can be automatically transformed to generate
exactly all programs with lower cost than q -- e.g., fewer conditional
expressions. Our algorithm can then be applied to show that the resulting
synthesis problem is unrealizable. We implemented the proposed technique in a
tool called NOPE. NOPE can prove unrealizability for 59/134 variants of
existing linear-integer-arithmetic SyGus benchmarks, whereas all existing SyGus
solvers lack the ability to prove that these benchmarks are unrealizable, and
time out on them.

likely to exhibit a similar extent of exploration. In this paper, we are
interested in learning policies for a project with future goals including the
extraction of interpretable strategies, rather than state-of-the-art

nuclear recoils (NR) producing 128 nm LAr scintillation photons observed by

interactions in DEAP-3600 was developed and is described in this work. The

the LAr, from ex-situ material assay measurements, and from dedicated
independent in-situ analyses. This prior information is used in a Bayesian fit
of the ER components to a 247.2 d dataset to model the radioactivity in the
surrounding detector materials. While excellent discrimination between ERs and
NRs is reached with pulse shape discrimination, utilizing the large difference
between fast and slow components of LAr scintillation light, detailed knowledge
of the ER background and activity of detector components, sets valuable
constraints on other key types of backgrounds in the detector: neutrons and
alphas. In addition, the activity of $^{42}$Ar in LAr in DEAP-3600 is
determined by measuring the daughter decay of $^{42}$K. This cosmogenically

characteristics. To explain its unusually rounded and relatively weak emission
line profiles, it has been proposed that WR2 is rotating close to break-up with
a magnetically confined wind. Alternatively, the line profiles could be
explained by the dilution of WR2's spectrum by that of a companion. In this
paper, we present a study of WR2 using near-infrared AO imaging and optical
spectroscopy and polarimetry. Our spectra reveal the presence of weak
photospheric absorption lines from a ~B2.5-4V companion, which however
contributes only ~5-10% to the total light, suggesting that the companion is a
background object. Therefore, its flux cannot be causing any significant
dilution of the WR star's emission lines. The absence of intrinsic linear
continuum polarization from WR2 does not support the proposed fast rotation.
Our Stokes V spectrum was not of sufficient quality to test the presence of a
moderately strong organized magnetic field but our new modelling indicates that
to confine the wind the putative magnetic field must be significantly stronger
than was previously suggested sufficiently strong as to make its presence
implausible.

contrast to the classical 3D-VAR formulation that penalizes the measurement
error directly, we present a modified formulation that penalizes the
experimentally-observable misfit in the measurement space. Furthermore, we
include a model correction term that allows to obtain an improved state
estimate. We begin by discussing the influence of the measurement space on the
amplification of noise and prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the
identification of a ""good"" measurement space. We then propose a certified
reduced basis (RB) method for the estimation of the model correction, the state
prediction, the adjoint solution and the observable misfit with respect to the
true state for real-time and many-query applications. A posteriori bounds are
proposed for the error in each of these approximations. Finally, we introduce
different approaches for the generation of the reduced basis spaces and the
stability-based selection of measurement functionals. The 3D-VAR method and the
associated certified reduced basis approximation are tested in a parameter and
state estimation problem for a steady-state thermal conduction problem with
unknown parameters and unknown Neumann boundary conditions.

be guided by task-based measures of image quality (IQ). It has been advocated
that imaging hardware or data-acquisition designs should be optimized by use of
an ideal observer (IO) that exploits full statistical knowledge of the
measurement noise and class of objects to be imaged, without consideration of
the reconstruction method. In practice, accurate and tractable models of the
complete object statistics are often difficult to determine. Moreover, in
imaging systems that employ compressive sensing concepts, imaging hardware and
sparse image reconstruction are innately coupled technologies. In this work, a
sparsity-driven observer (SDO) that can be employed to optimize hardware by use
of a stochastic object model describing object sparsity is described and
investigated. The SDO and sparse reconstruction method can therefore be
""matched"" in the sense that they both utilize the same statistical information
regarding the class of objects to be imaged. To efficiently compute the SDO
test statistic, computational tools developed recently for variational Bayesian
inference with sparse linear models are adopted. The use of the SDO to rank
data-acquisition designs in a stylized example as motivated by magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is demonstrated. This study reveals that the SDO can
produce rankings that are consistent with visual assessments of the
reconstructed images but different from those produced by use of the
traditionally employed Hotelling observer (HO).

show how the FMR emerges from the local anti-correlation between SFR surface

derive the global FMR from the local law, and then show that both relations
agree quantitatively when considering the star-forming galaxies of the MaNGA

origin of the anti-correlation between SFR and metallicity followed by the set
of star-forming regions of any typical galaxy. The correspondence between local

should exist associated with known global relations.

reduction in the uncertainty associated to each orbital element, in terms of a
decrease in dispersion measures (such as the interquartile range) of the
posterior distribution of relevant orbital parameters. The extent to which the

next nearest neighbor hopping stabilizes the fully spin-polarized phase up
until |t'/t|=0.5. Surprisingly, for this value of t', the ground state is fully
spin-polarized for almost any electron density 1 $\gtrsim \rho \gtrsim$ 0,
connecting the Nagaoka state to itinerant ferromagnetism at low density. Also,
we find that the previously found checkerboard insulator phase at t'=0 and
$\rho$=0.75 is unstable against t'.

interactions involving some specific set of core nodes. This results in a
network dataset containing the core nodes along with a potentially much larger

core nodes might be a set of individuals under surveillance, where we observe
the attendees of meetings involving at least one of the core individuals. We
model such scenarios using hypergraphs, and we study the problem of core
recovery: if we observe the hypergraph but not the labels of core and fringe
nodes, can we recover the ""planted"" set of core nodes in the hypergraph?
  We provide a theoretical framework for analyzing the recovery of such a set
of core nodes and use our theory to develop a practical and scalable algorithm
for core recovery. The crux of our analysis and algorithm is that the core
nodes are a hitting set of the hypergraph, meaning that every hyperedge has at
least one node in the set of core nodes. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
algorithm on a number of real-world datasets, outperforming competitive
baselines derived from network centrality and core-periphery measures.

study the details of a new source of gravitational waves whose origin is in
quantum physics. Namely, it is well known that massless fields in curved
backgrounds suffer from the so-called ""trace anomaly"". This anomaly can be cast
in terms of new scalar degrees of freedom which take account of macroscopic
effects of quantum matter in gravitational fields. The linearized effective
action for these fields describes scalar (as opposed to transverse)
gravitational waves, which are absent in Einstein's theory. Since these new
degrees of freedom couple directly to the gauge field scalars in QCD, the epoch
of the QCD phase transition in early universe is a possible source of
primordial cosmological gravitational radiation. While the anomaly is most
likely fully unsuppressed at the QCD densities (temperature is much higher than
the u and d quark masses), just to be careful we introduced the window function
which cuts-off very low frequencies where the anomaly effect might be
suppressed. We then calculated the characteristic strain of the properly
adjusted gravitational waves signal today. The region of the parameter space
with no window function gives a stronger signal, and both the strain and the
frequencies fall within the sensitivity of the near future gravitational wave
experiments (e.g. LISA and The Big Bang Observer). The possibility that one can
study quantum physics with gravitational wave astronomy even in principle is
exciting, and will be of value for future endeavors in this field.

increasing the spectral resolution of observations to R = 300,000 - 400,000

in planets with atmospheres similar to Earth's. Resolutions higher than about
500,000 do not produce significant gains in the depths of the O2 lines. We
confirm that observations in the O2 A-band are the most efficient except for
M9V host stars, for which observations in the O2 NIR-band are more efficient.
Combining observations in the O2 A, B, and NIR -bands can reduce the number of
transits needed to produce a detection of O2 by about 1/3 in the case of white
noise limited observations. However, that advantage disappears in the presence
of typical levels of red noise. Therefore, combining observations in more than
one band produces no significant gains versus observing only in the A-band,
unless red-noise can be significantly reduced. Blending between the exoplanet's
O2 lines and telluric O2 lines is a known problem. We find that problem can be
alleviated by increasing the resolution of the observations, and by giving
preference to targets near the ecliptic.

theories (EFTs) whose scattering amplitudes exhibit enhanced soft limits. These
enhancements arise due to non-linearly realised symmetries on the Goldstone
modes of such EFTs and we classify the algebras that these symmetries can form.
Our main focus is on so-called exceptional algebras which lead to
field-dependent transformation rules and EFTs with the maximum possible soft
enhancement at a given derivative power counting. We adapt existing techniques
for Poincar\'{e} invariant theories to the supersymmetric case, and introduce
superspace inverse Higgs constraints as a method of reducing the number of
Goldstone modes while maintaining all symmetries.
  Restricting to the case of a single Goldstone supermultiplet in four
dimensions, we classify the exceptional algebras and EFTs for a chiral, Maxwell
or real linear supermultiplet. Moreover, we show how our algebraic approach
allows one to read off the soft weights of the different component fields from
superspace inverse Higgs trees, which are the algebraic cousin of the on-shell
soft data one provides to soft bootstrap EFTs using on-shell recursion. Our
Lie-superalgebraic approach extends the results of on-shell methods and
provides a complementary perspective on non-linear realisations.

covered by ground-based surveys. We find that the signal can be explained by a
bright source that fully envelops the planetary caustic, i.e., a ""Hollywood""
geometry. Combined with the source proper motion measured from $Gaia$, the
$Spitzer$ satellite parallax measurement makes it possible to precisely
constrain the lens physical parameters. The preferred solution, in which the
planet perturbs the minor image due to lensing by the host, yields a
Uranus-mass planet with a mass of $M_{\rm p} = 13.9\pm1.6~M_{\oplus}$ orbiting
a mid M-dwarf with a mass of $M_{\rm h} = 0.23\pm0.03~M_{\odot}$. There is also
a second possible solution that is substantially disfavored but cannot be ruled
out, for which the planet perturbs the major image. The latter solution yields
$M_{\rm p} = 1.2\pm0.2~M_{\oplus}$ and $M_{\rm h} = 0.15\pm0.02~M_{\odot}$. By
combining the microlensing and $Gaia$ data together with a Galactic model, we

behave differently in finite precision arithmetic. For problems where the

involves only an autoencoder with a carefully designed bottleneck. We formally
show that this scheme can achieve distribution-matching style transfer by
training only on a self-reconstruction loss. Based on this scheme, we proposed
AUTOVC, which achieves state-of-the-art results in many-to-many voice
conversion with non-parallel data, and which is the first to perform zero-shot

({\em ARF}) is a popular ensemble method used for continual learning due to its
simplicity in combining adaptive leveraging bagging with fast random Hoeffding

a method for reducing the number of trees in the ARF ensemble while providing
similar accuracy. {\em ESRF} extends {\em ARF} with two orthogonal components:
1) a swap component that splits learners into two sets based on their accuracy
(only classifiers with the highest accuracy are used to make predictions); and
2) an elastic component for dynamically increasing or decreasing the number of
classifiers in the ensemble. The experimental evaluation of {\em ESRF} and

Bayesian toolbox for addressing problems in which the likelihood is
prohibitively expensive or entirely unknown, making it intractable. ABC defines
a pseudo-posterior by comparing observed data with simulated data,
traditionally based on some summary statistics, the elicitation of which is
regarded as a key difficulty. Recently, using data discrepancy measures has
been proposed in order to bypass the construction of summary statistics. Here
we propose to use the importance-sampling ABC (IS-ABC) algorithm relying on the
so-called two-sample energy statistic. We establish a new asymptotic result for
the case where both the observed sample size and the simulated data sample size
increase to infinity, which highlights to what extent the data discrepancy
measure impacts the asymptotic pseudo-posterior. The result holds in the broad
setting of IS-ABC methodologies, thus generalizing previous results that have
been established only for rejection ABC algorithms. Furthermore, we propose a
consistent V-statistic estimator of the energy statistic, under which we show
that the large sample result holds, and prove that the rejection ABC algorithm,
based on the energy statistic, generates pseudo-posterior distributions that
achieves convergence to the correct limits, when implemented with rejection
thresholds that converge to zero, in the finite sample setting. Our proposed
energy statistic based ABC algorithm is demonstrated on a variety of models,
including a Gaussian mixture, a moving-average model of order two, a bivariate
beta and a multivariate $g$-and-$k$ distribution. We find that our proposed
method compares well with alternative discrepancy measures.

  Strategies","accepted in Evolutionary Computation Journal (MIT Press)",,,,"cs.NE math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce an acceleration for covariance matrix adaptation evolution
strategies (CMA-ES) by means of adaptive diagonal decoding (dd-CMA). This
diagonal acceleration endows the default CMA-ES with the advantages of
separable CMA-ES without inheriting its drawbacks. Technically, we introduce a
diagonal matrix D that expresses coordinate-wise variances of the sampling
distribution in DCD form. The diagonal matrix can learn a rescaling of the
problem in the coordinates within linear number of function evaluations.
Diagonal decoding can also exploit separability of the problem, but, crucially,
does not compromise the performance on non-separable problems. The latter is
accomplished by modulating the learning rate for the diagonal matrix based on
the condition number of the underlying correlation matrix. dd-CMA-ES not only
combines the advantages of default and separable CMA-ES, but may achieve
overadditive speedup: it improves the performance, and even the scaling, of the
better of default and separable CMA-ES on classes of non-separable test
functions that reflect, arguably, a landscape feature commonly observed in
practice.
  The paper makes two further secondary contributions: we introduce two
different approaches to guarantee positive definiteness of the covariance
matrix with active CMA, which is valuable in particular with large population
size; we revise the default parameter setting in CMA-ES, proposing accelerated
settings in particular for large dimension.
  All our contributions can be viewed as independent improvements of CMA-ES,
yet they are also complementary and can be seamlessly combined. In numerical
experiments with dd-CMA-ES up to dimension 5120, we observe remarkable
improvements over the original covariance matrix adaptation on functions with
coordinate-wise ill-conditioning. The improvement is observed also for large
population sizes up to about dimension squared.

vertex-transitivity. In this paper, we propose lackadaisical quantum walks
where the self-loops have different weights. We investigate spatial search on
the complete bipartite graph, which can be irregular with $N_1$ and $N_2$
vertices in each partite set, and this naturally leads to self-loops in each
partite set having different weights $l_1$ and $l_2$, respectively. We
analytically prove that for large $N_1$ and $N_2$, if the $k$ marked vertices
are confined to, say, the first partite set, then with the typical initial
uniform state over the vertices, the success probability is improved from its
non-lackadaisical value when $l_1 = kN_2/2N_1$ and $N_2 > (3 - 2\sqrt{2}) N_1$,
regardless of $l_2$. When the initial state is stationary under the quantum
walk, however, then the success probability is improved when $l_1 = kN_2/2N_1$,
now without a constraint on the ratio of $N_1$ and $N_2$, and again independent
of $l_2$. Next, when marked vertices lie in both partite sets, then for either

back-propagating through the energy minimization and the backbone CNN, which
makes the CNN adapt to the dynamics of the contour evolution. Experiments on

non-superconducting nature of each constituent material. Upon interfacing FeTe
with two quintuple layers of Bi2Te3, we found that the Dirac-cone surface state
of Bi2Te3 is shifted toward higher binding energy, while the holelike band at
the Fermi level originating from FeTe moves toward lower binding energy. This
suggests that electron charge transfer takes place from FeTe to Bi2Te3 through
the interface. The present result points to importance of hole-doped FeTe
interface for the occurrence of unconventional superconductivity.

current evaluation metrics are flawed as they only consider unseen

naive baseline methods perform similarly or better than current approaches.

with time flexibility. In this paper, we study the MNO's optimal multi-cap data
plans with time flexibility in a realistic asymmetric information scenario.
Specifically, users are associated with multi-dimensional private information,
and the MNO designs a contract (with different data caps and subscription fees)
to induce users to truthfully reveal their private information. This problem is
quite challenging due to the multi-dimensional private information. We address
the challenge in two aspects. First, we find that a feasible contract
(satisfying incentive compatibility and individual rationality) should allocate
the data caps according to users' willingness-to-pay (captured by the slopes of
users' indifference curves). Second, for the non-convex data cap allocation
problem, we propose a Dynamic Quota Allocation Algorithm, which has a low
complexity and guarantees the global optimality. Numerical results show that
the time-flexible data mechanisms increase both the MNO's profit (25% on

function, vanishing only at the first-order stationary points of each player's

stationary point of the GNI function. For the particular case of bilinear
min-max games and multi-player quadratic games, the GNI function is convex.
Hence, the application of gradient descent in this case yields linear

well-known fact that independent components must be whitened, we introduce a
novel Independent-Component (IC) layer before each weight layer, whose inputs
would be made more independent. However, determining independent components is
a computationally intensive task. To overcome this challenge, we propose to
implement an IC layer by combining two popular techniques, Batch Normalization
and Dropout, in a new manner that we can rigorously prove that Dropout can
quadratically reduce the mutual information and linearly reduce the correlation
between any pair of neurons with respect to the dropout layer parameter $p$. As
demonstrated experimentally, the IC layer consistently outperforms the baseline
approaches with more stable training process, faster convergence speed and
better convergence limit on CIFAR10/100 and ILSVRC2012 datasets. The
implementation of our IC layer makes us rethink the common practices in the
design of neural networks. For example, we should not place Batch Normalization
before ReLU since the non-negative responses of ReLU will make the weight layer
updated in a suboptimal way, and we can achieve better performance by combining
Batch Normalization and Dropout together as an IC layer.

DNNs are of local isometry on data distributions of practical interest; by
using a new covering of the sample space and introducing the local isometry
property of DNNs into generalization analysis, we establish a new
generalization error bound that is both scale- and range-sensitive to singular

spectrum of equal singular values, among which orthogonal weight matrix or a
non-square one with orthonormal rows or columns is the most straightforward
choice, suggesting the algorithms of OrthDNNs. We present both algorithms of
strict and approximate OrthDNNs, and for the later ones we propose a simple yet
effective algorithm called Singular Value Bounding (SVB), which performs as
well as strict OrthDNNs, but at a much lower computational cost. We also

with setting (higher) capital requirements for market participants. There are
indications that while equity ratios have been increased massively since the
financial crisis, systemic risk levels might not have lowered, but even
increased. It has been shown that systemic risk is to a large extent related to
the underlying network topology of financial exposures. A natural question
arising is how much systemic risk can be eliminated by optimally rearranging
these networks and without increasing capital requirements. Overlapping
portfolios with minimized systemic risk which provide the same market
functionality as empirical ones have been studied by [pichler2018]. Here we
propose a similar method for direct exposure networks, and apply it to
cross-sectional interbank loan networks, consisting of 10 quarterly
observations of the Austrian interbank market. We show that the suggested
framework rearranges the network topology, such that systemic risk is reduced
by a factor of approximately 3.5, and leaves the relevant economic features of
the optimized network and its agents unchanged. The presented optimization
procedure is not intended to actually re-configure interbank markets, but to
demonstrate the huge potential for systemic risk management through rearranging
exposure networks, in contrast to increasing capital requirements that were
shown to have only marginal effects on systemic risk [poledna2017]. Ways to
actually incentivize a self-organized formation toward optimal network
configurations were introduced in [thurner2013] and [poledna2016]. For
regulatory policies concerning financial market stability the knowledge of
minimal systemic risk for a given economic environment can serve as a benchmark
for monitoring actual systemic risk in markets.

dedicated core of MCF is used to transmit QSs and the wavelengths of QSs are
set lower than those of upstream signals. Also, we demonstrate that wavelength
time division multiplexing (WTDM) is suitable for QSs which are required to

  Reconstruction Without Brain Extraction","26 pages",,,,"eess.IV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) estimates the underlying tissue
magnetic susceptibility from MRI gradient-echo phase signal and typically
requires several processing steps. These steps involve phase unwrapping, brain
volume extraction, background phase removal and solving an ill-posed inverse
problem. The resulting susceptibility map is known to suffer from inaccuracy
near the edges of the brain tissues, in part due to imperfect brain extraction,
edge erosion of the brain tissue and the lack of phase measurement outside the
brain. This inaccuracy has thus hindered the application of QSM for measuring
the susceptibility of tissues near the brain edges, e.g., quantifying cortical
layers and generating superficial venography. To address these challenges, we
propose a learning-based QSM reconstruction method that directly estimates the
magnetic susceptibility from total phase images without the need for brain
extraction and background phase removal, referred to as autoQSM. The neural
network has a modified U-net structure and is trained using QSM maps computed
by a two-step QSM method. 209 healthy subjects with ages ranging from 11 to 82
years were employed for patch-wise network training. The network was validated
on data dissimilar to the training data, e.g. in vivo mouse brain data and
brains with lesions, which suggests that the network has generalized and
learned the underlying mathematical relationship between magnetic field
perturbation and magnetic susceptibility. AutoQSM was able to recover magnetic
susceptibility of anatomical structures near the edges of the brain including
the veins covering the cortical surface, spinal cord and nerve tracts near the
mouse brain boundaries. The advantages of high-quality maps, no need for brain
volume extraction and high reconstruction speed demonstrate its potential for
future applications.

gradient training, which requires the computation of aggregated stochastic

in such applications, and in recent years, compressed stochastic gradient
methods such as QSGD (quantized SGD) and sparse SGD have been proposed to
reduce communication. It was also shown that error compensation can be combined
with compression to achieve better convergence in a scheme that each node
compresses its local stochastic gradient and broadcast the result to all other
nodes over the network in a single pass. However, such a single pass broadcast
approach is not realistic in many practical implementations. For example, under
the popular parameter server model for distributed learning, the worker nodes
need to send the compressed local gradients to the parameter server, which
performs the aggregation. The parameter server has to compress the aggregated
stochastic gradient again before sending it back to the worker nodes. In this
work, we provide a detailed analysis on this two-pass communication model and
its asynchronous parallel variant, with error-compensated compression both on
the worker nodes and on the parameter server. We show that the

2) it admits an improved convergence rate than the non error-compensated
stochastic gradient methods such as QSGD and sparse SGD; 3) it admits linear
speedup with respect to the number of workers. The empirical study is also

granularity. However, using these data to understand phenomena in a broader
population is difficult due to their non-representativeness and the bias of
statistical inference tools towards dominant languages and groups. While
demographic attribute inference could be used to mitigate such bias, current
techniques are almost entirely monolingual and fail to work in a global
environment. We address these challenges by combining multilingual demographic
inference with post-stratification to create a more representative population
sample. To learn demographic attributes, we create a new multimodal deep neural
architecture for joint classification of age, gender, and organization-status
of social media users that operates in 32 languages. This method substantially
outperforms current state of the art while also reducing algorithmic bias. To
correct for sampling biases, we propose fully interpretable multilevel
regression methods that estimate inclusion probabilities from inferred joint
population counts and ground-truth population counts. In a large experiment
over multilingual heterogeneous European regions, we show that our demographic
inference and bias correction together allow for more accurate estimates of
populations and make a significant step towards representative social sensing
in downstream applications with multilingual social media.

183143 and HD 204827 (Hobbs et al. 2008 and 2009). Twenty-five medium-to-highly
reddened sight lines were selected, sampling a variety of spectral types of the
background star and the interstellar environments. The median SNR of these
spectra is ~ 1,300 around 6,400{\AA}. Compared to the Atlas Catalog, 22 new
DIBs were found, and the boundaries of 27 (sets) of DIBs were adjusted,
resulting in an updated catalog containing 559 DIBs that we refer to as the
Apache Point Observatory Catalog of Optical Diffuse Interstellar Bands.
Measurements were then made based on this catalog. We found our survey most
sensitive between 5,500 and 7,000{\AA} due largely to the local SNR of the
spectra, the relative absence of interfering stellar lines, and the weakness of
telluric residuals. For our data sample, the number of DIBs detected in a given
sight line is mostly dependent on EB-V and less on the spectral type of the
background star. Some dependence on fH2 is observed, but less well-determined
due to the limited size of the data sample. The variations of the wavelengths
of each DIB in different sight lines are generally larger than those of the
known interstellar lines CH+, CH, and K I. Those variations could be due to the
inherent error in the measurement, or to differences in the velocity components
among sight lines.

computer system in order to assess it's security. Although an effective method
for testing security, pentesting requires highly skilled practitioners and
currently there is a growing shortage of skilled cyber security professionals.
One avenue for alleviating this problem is automate the pentesting process
using artificial intelligence techniques. Current approaches to automated
pentesting have relied on model-based planning, however the cyber security
landscape is rapidly changing making maintaining up-to-date models of exploits
a challenge. This project investigated the application of model-free
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to automated pentesting. Model-free RL has the key
advantage over model-based planning of not requiring a model of the
environment, instead learning the best policy through interaction with the
environment. We first designed and built a fast, low compute simulator for
training and testing autonomous pentesting agents. We did this by framing
pentesting as a Markov Decision Process with the known configuration of the
network as states, the available scans and exploits as actions, the reward
determined by the value of machines on the network. We then used this simulator
to investigate the application of model-free RL to pentesting. We tested the
standard Q-learning algorithm using both tabular and neural network based
implementations. We found that within the simulated environment both tabular
and neural network implementations were able to find optimal attack paths for a
range of different network topologies and sizes without having a model of
action behaviour. However, the implemented algorithms were only practical for
smaller networks and numbers of actions. Further work is needed in developing
scalable RL algorithms and testing these algorithms in larger and higher
fidelity environments.

Additional infinite families of graphs with this property are constructed by
amalgamating universally diametrical graphs with center-regular trees.

multiple protections for safeguarding the integrity of kernel code and data are
being continuously proposed and deployed. These existing protections, however,
are far from ideal as they either provide partial protection, or require
complex and high overhead hardware and software stacks.
  In this work, we present Neverland: a low-overhead, hardware-assisted, memory
protection scheme that safeguards the operating system from rootkits and
kernel-mode malware. Once the system is done booting, Neverland's hardware
takes away the operating system's ability to overwrite certain configuration
registers, as well as portions of its own physical address space that contain
kernel code and security-critical data. Furthermore, it prohibits the CPU from
fetching privileged code from any memory region lying outside the physical
addresses assigned to the OS kernel and drivers (regardless of virtual page
permissions). This combination of protections makes it extremely hard for an
attacker to tamper with the kernel or introduce new privileged code into the
system -- even in the presence of kernel vulnerabilities. Our evaluations show
that the extra hardware required to support these protections incurs minimal
silicon and energy overheads. Neverland enables operating systems to reduce

Though many methods have been proposed for horizontal and oriented texts,
detecting irregular shape texts such as curved texts is still a challenging
problem. To solve the problem, we propose a robust scene text detection method
with adaptive text region representation. Given an input image, a text region
proposal network is first used for extracting text proposals. Then, these
proposals are verified and refined with a refinement network. Here, recurrent
neural network based adaptive text region representation is proposed for text
region refinement, where a pair of boundary points are predicted each time step
until no new points are found. In this way, text regions of arbitrary shapes
are detected and represented with adaptive number of boundary points. This
gives more accurate description of text regions. Experimental results on five

techniques to produce pivots and utilize holistic partitioning methods based on
the generated pivots to partition data, which results in data skew problem
since both the generated pivots and the partition strategies have no quality

  To address the limitation, we propose SP-Join, an end-to-end framework to
support distributed similarity join in metric space based on the MapReduce
paradigm, which (i) employs an estimation-based stratified sampling method to
produce pivots with quality guarantees for any sample size, and (ii) devises an

obtaining an optimal set of partitions is proven to be NP-Hard, SP-Join adopts
efficient partitioning strategies based on such a cost model to achieve an even

  parametric shape design and optimisation in naval engineering problems",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the reduced order modeling (ROM) framework, the solution of a parametric
partial differential equation is approximated by combining the high-fidelity
solutions of the problem at hand for several properly chosen configurations.
Examples of the ROM application, in the naval field, can be found in [31, 24].
Mandatory ingredient for the ROM methods is the relation between the
high-fidelity solutions and the parameters. Dealing with geometrical
parameters, especially in the industrial context, this relation may be unknown
and not trivial (simulations over hand morphed geometries) or very complex
(high number of parameters or many nested morphing techniques). To overcome
these scenarios, we propose in this contribution an efficient and complete
data-driven framework involving ROM techniques for shape design and
optimization, extending the pipeline presented in [7]. By applying the singular
value decomposition (SVD) to the points coordinates defining the hull geometry
- assuming the topology is inaltered by the deformation -, we are able to
compute the optimal space which the deformed geometries belong to, hence using
the modal coefficients as the new parameters we can reconstruct the parametric
formulation of the domain. Finally the output of interest is approximated using
the proper orthogonal decomposition with interpolation technique. To conclude,
we apply this framework to a naval shape design problem where the bulbous bow
is morphed to reduce the total resistance of the ship advancing in calm water.

It is characterised by a high degree of intercommunication, embedded

Additionally, cloud-storage and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) approaches enhance
a centralised storage and handling of data. This often takes place in
third-party networks. Furthermore, Industry 4.0 is driven by novel business
cases. Lot sizes of one, customer individual production, observation of process
state and progress in real-time and remote maintenance, just to name a few. All
of these new business cases make use of the novel technologies. However, cyber
security has not been an issue in industry. Industrial networks have been
considered physically separated from public networks. Additionally, the high
level of uniqueness of any industrial network was said to prevent attackers
from exploiting flaws. Those assumptions are inherently broken by the concept
of Industry 4.0. As a result, an abundance of attack vectors is created. In the
past, attackers have used those attack vectors in spectacular fashions.
Especially Small and Mediumsized Enterprises (SMEs) in Germany struggle to
adapt to these challenges. Reasons are the cost required for technical
solutions and security professionals. In order to enable SMEs to cope with the
growing threat in the cyberspace, the research project IUNO Insec aims at
providing and improving security solutions that can be used without specialised
security knowledge. The project IUNO Insec is briefly introduced in this work.

of \ion{O}{VI}$\lambda\lambda$1032 and 1038 with atomic hydrogen. These

video bit rate to avoid network congestion has become critical, since
congestion results in self-inflicted delay and packet loss which deteriorate
the quality of real-time video service. The existing congestion control is hard
to simultaneously achieve low latency, high throughput, good adaptability and
fair bandwidth allocation, mainly because of the hardwired control strategy and
egocentric convergence objective. To address these issues, we propose an
end-to-end statistical learning based congestion control, named Iris. By
exploring the underlying principles of self-inflicted delay, we reveal that
congestion delay is determined by sending rate, receiving rate and network
status, which inspires us to control video bit rate using a
statistical-learning congestion control model. The key idea of Iris is to force
all flows to converge to the same queue load, and adjust the bit rate by the
model. All flows keep a small and fixed number of packets queuing in the
network, thus the fair bandwidth allocation and low latency are both achieved.
Besides, the adjustment step size of sending rate is updated by online
learning, to better adapt to dynamically changing networks. We carried out
extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of Iris, with the
implementations of transport layer (UDP) and application layer (QUIC)
respectively. The testing environment includes emulated network, real-world
Internet and commercial LTE networks. Compared against TCP flavors and
state-of-the-art protocols, Iris is able to achieve high bandwidth utilization,
low latency and good fairness concurrently. Especially over QUIC, Iris is able
to increase the video bitrate up to 25%, and PSNR up to 1dB.

${\overline{R}_{mon}}(n;2)=(n-1)^2+1$ and
${\overline{R}_{mon}}(n;3)=\binom{2n-4}{n-2}+1$, respectively. It follows from
a result of Eli\'{a}\v{s} and Matou\v{s}ek that ${\overline{R}_{mon}}(n;4)\geq
tow_3(\Omega(n))$.
  We show that ${\overline{R}_{mon}}(n;r)\geq tow_{r-1}(\Omega(n))$ for every
$r \geq 3$. This, in particular, solves an open problem posed by Eli\'{a}\v{s}
and Matou\v{s}ek and by Moshkovitz and Shapira. Using two geometric
interpretations of monotone colorings, we show connections between estimating
${\overline{R}_{mon}}(n;r)$ and two Ramsey-type problems that have been
recently considered by several researchers. Namely, we show connections with
higher-order Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres theorems and with Ramsey-type problems for
order-type homogeneous sequences of points.
  We also prove that the number of $r$-monotone colorings of
$\binom{\{1,\dots,N\}}{r}$ is $2^{N^{r-1}/r^{\Theta(r)}}$ for $N \geq r \geq
3$, which generalizes the well-known fact that the number of simple
arrangements of~$N$ pseudolines is $2^{\Theta(N^2)}$.

the accuracy of the model and its complexity and a method to measure the

Building on previous work, we present an extension of the NRTidal model for

expression for the tidal contribution to the GW phase which includes further
analytical knowledge and is calibrated to more accurate numerical relativity
data than previously available; (ii) a tidal correction to the GW amplitude;
(iii) an extension of the spin-sector incorporating equation-of-state-dependent
finite size effects at quadrupolar and octupolar order; these appear in the
spin-spin tail terms and cubic-in-spin terms, both at 3.5PN. We add the new
description to the precessing binary black hole waveform model IMRPhenomPv2 to
obtain a frequency-domain precessing binary neutron star model. In addition, we
extend the SEOBNRv4_ROM and IMRPhenomD aligned-spin binary black hole waveform
models with the improved tidal phase corrections. Focusing on the new
IMRPhenomPv2_NRTidalv2 approximant, we test the model by comparing with

effective-one-body and numerical relativity data. We also check consistency
against a tidal effective-one-body model across large regions of the BNS

having solar panels faced in different directions in 3-dimensional space, the
tree system would be able to pick up more sunlight than a flat solar panel. The
results were promising, but this project did not take every factor into
account. Specifically, optimum shape, temperature and the resistance of system,
reflection of sun-rays were not explored in this project. This paper will take
an approach from origami paper folding to create the optimum arrangement that
will allow the overall system to absorb the maximum energy. Since the system
stays stationary throughout the day, it can reduce the maintenance cost and
excess energy use because it does not require solar tracking. In this project
we have implemented a variety of Evolutionary Algorithms to find the most
efficient way to cut a flat solar panel and arrange the resulting smaller
panels. Each solution in the population will be tested by computing the amount
of solar energy that is absorbed at particular times of the day. The EA will be
exploring different combinations of angles and heights of the smaller panels on
the tree such that the system can produce the maximum amount of power

observations, CO(2-1) emission was detected as radial filaments lying in the
east-west direction. We resolved the inner filament and found that the filament
cannot be represented by a simple infalling stream both morphologically and
kinematically. The observed complex nature of the filament resembles the cold
gas structure predicted by recent numerical simulations of cold chaotic
accretion. A crude estimate suggests that the accretion rate of the cold gas
can be higher than that of hot gas. Within the central 100 pc, we detected a
rotational disk of the molecular gas whose mass is $\sim10^{8} M_{\sun}$. This
is the first evidence of the presence of massive cold gas disk on this spatial
scale for BCGs. The disk rotation axis is approximately consistent with the
axis of the radio jet on subpc scales. This probably suggests that the cold gas
disk is physically connected to the innermost accretion disk which is
responsible for jet launching. We also detected absorption features in the
HCN(3-2) and HCO$^{+}$(3-2) spectra against the radio continuum emission mostly
radiated by $\sim1.2$-pc size jet. The absorption features are blue-shifted

introducing the basic concept of blockchain and illustrating why consensus
mechanism plays an indispensable role in a blockchain enabled IoT system. Then,
we discuss the main ideas of two famous consensus mechanisms including Proof of

two mainstream Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) based consensus mechanisms, i.e., the

rate. A concrete example is constructed, which provides a lower bound for the
exact worst case convergence rate. Amazingly, this lower bound coincides with
the exact worst case bound computed via the performance estimation framework.
This observation motivates us to conjecture that the lower bound provided by
the example is exactly the worse case iteration bound, which is then verified
theoretically. We thus have established an ergodic sublinear convergence rate
that is optimal in terms of both the order of the sublinear rate and all the

successful communication between two oscillating neural populations depends not

between them. More precisely, effective communication occurs when the emitting
and receiving populations are properly phase locked so the inputs sent by the
emitting population arrive at the phases of maximal excitability of the
receiving population. To study this setting, we consider a population rate
model consisting of excitatory and inhibitory cells modelling the receiving

the input from the emitting population. We consider the stroboscopic map for
this system and compute numerically the fixed and periodic points of this map

emphasizing its implications for the CTC theory. In particular, we study how
the input gain depends on the timing between the input and the inhibitory
action of the receiving population. Our results show that naturally an optimal
phase locking for CTC emerges, and provide a mechanism by which the receiving

bistable regions, suggests a mechanism by which different communication regimes

Enhancement of fluorescence brightness of up to 240-fold was observed,

an excitation enhancement of 63-fold and emission enhancement of up to

Earth's magnetic field is sustained against ohmic dissipation and the small
scales of the turbulent and electrically conducting underlying fluid flow in
the outer core. Here, the properties of this scale separation are analysed
using high-resolution numerical simulations that approach closer to Earth's
core conditions than earlier models. The new simulations are obtained by
increasing the resolution and gradually relaxing the hyperdiffusive
approximation of previously published low-resolution cases. This upsizing
process does not perturb the previously obtained large-scale, leading-order
quasi-geostrophic (QG), and first-order magneto-Archimedes-Coriolis (MAC) force
balances. As Earth's core conditions are approached in the upsized simulations,
kinetic energy spectra feature a gradually broadening self-similar, power-law
spectral range extending over more than a decade in length scale. In this
range, the spectral energy density profile of vorticity is shown to be
approximately flat between the large scale at which the magnetic field draws
its energy from convection through the QG-MAC force balance and the small scale
at which this energy is dissipated. The resulting velocity and density anomaly
planforms in the physical space consist in large-scale columnar sheets and
plumes, respectively co-existing with small-scale vorticity filaments and
density anomaly ramifications. In contrast, magnetic field planforms keep their
large-scale structure after upsizing. The diagnostic outputs of the upsized
simulations are more consistent with the asymptotic QG-MAC theory than those of
the low-resolution cases that they originate from, but still feature small
residual deviations that may call for further theoretical refinements to
account for the structuring constraints of the magnetic field on the flow.

  Abstract modified to fulfill the arXiv number limit of characters",,"10.3390/universe5050110",,"astro-ph.HE gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Short and long Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate in subclasses with specific
energy release, spectra, duration, etc, and have binary progenitors. We review
here the binary-driven hypernovae (BdHNe) subclass whose progenitor is a
CO$_\textrm{core}$-neutron star (NS). The supernova (SN) explosion of the
CO$_\textrm{core}$ produces at its center a new NS ($\nu$NS) and triggers a
hypercritical accretion onto the NS. The NS can become a more massive NS or
collapse into a black hole (BH). We summarize this topic from the first
analytic estimates in 2012 to the most recent three-dimensional (3D)
smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical simulations in 2018. Long GRBs
are richer and more complex than previously thought. The SN and the accretion
explain X-ray precursors. The NS accretion, its collapse and the BH formation
produce asymmetries in the SN ejecta, implying a 3D GRB analysis. The newborn
BH surrounded by the ejecta and the magnetic field inherited from the NS, are
the \emph{inner engine} from which the electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) plasma and
the high-energy emission initiate. The $e^+e^-$ impact on the ejecta converts
the SN into a hypernova (HN). The plasma dynamics in the ejecta explains the
ultrarelativistic prompt emission in the MeV domain and the mildly-relativistic
flares of the early afterglow in the X-ray domain. The feedback of the $\nu$NS
emission on the HN explains the X-ray late afterglow and its power-law regime.
All the above is in contrast with GRB models attempting to explain all the GRB
phases with the kinetic energy of anultrarelativistic jet, as traditionally
proposed in the ""collapsar-fireball"" model. In addition, BdHNe in their
different flavors lead to $\nu$NS-NS or $\nu$NS-BH binaries. These binaries
merge by gravitational wave emission producing short GRBs, establishing a
connection between long and short GRBs and their occurrence rates.

non-trivial configuration, while it is absent in the trivial one. Contrarily to
conventional topological insulators (TIs), the topological state has two
dimensions less than the bulk, denoting a HOTI. The corner mode is protected by
a generalized chiral symmetry, which leads to a particular robustness against

temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T1), we find that
by changing A in the order of A=Na, Na0.75K0.25, K, and Rb, the system is tuned
to approach a FM quantum critical point (QCP). This may be ascribed to the
Cr2-As2-Cr2 bond angle that decreases towards 90 degrees, which enhances the FM
interaction via the Cr2-As2-Cr2 path. Upon moving away from the QCP, the
superconducting transition temperature Tsc increases progressively up to 8.0 K
in Na2Cr3As3, which is in sharp contrast to the AFM case where Tsc usually
shows a maximum around a QCP. The 1/T1 decreases rapidly below Tsc with no
Hebel-Slichter peak, and ubiquitously follows a T5 variation below a
characteristic temperature T*=0.6 Tsc, which indicates the existence of point
nodes in the superconducting gap function commonly in the family. These results

higher thermal inertias than faster rotators because the heat wave penetrates
deeper into the sub-surface. However, thermal inertias have been determined
mainly for fast rotators due to selection effects in the available photometry
used to obtain shape models required for thermophysical modelling (TPM).
  Aims. Our aims are to mitigate these selection effects by producing shape
models of slow rotators, to scale them and compute their thermal inertia with
TPM, and to verify whether thermal inertia increases with the rotation period.
  Methods. To decrease the bias against slow rotators, we conducted a
photometric observing campaign of main-belt asteroids with periods longer than
12 hours, from multiple stations worldwide, adding in some cases data from WISE
and Kepler space telescopes. For spin and shape reconstruction we used the
lightcurve inversion method, and to derive thermal inertias we applied a
thermophysical model to fit available infrared data from IRAS, AKARI, and WISE.
  Results. We present new models of 11 slow rotators that provide a good fit to
the thermal data. In two cases, the TPM analysis showed a clear preference for
one of the two possible mirror solutions. We derived the diameters and albedos
of our targets in addition to their thermal inertias, which ranged between
3$^{+33}_{-3}$ and 45$^{+60}_{-30}$ Jm$^{-2}$s$^{-1/2}$K$^{-1}$.
  Conclusions. Together with our previous work, we have analysed 16 slow
rotators from our dense survey with sizes between 30 and 150 km. The current
sample thermal inertias vary widely, which does not confirm the earlier
suggestion that slower rotators have higher thermal inertias.

aperture microscopy (ISAM) under dispersion encoding. With this, one can
effectively double the depth range of optical coherence tomography (OCT),
whilst dramatically enhancing the spatial resolution away from the focal plane.
To this end, we propose a model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) method,
where ISAM is directly considered in an optimization approach, and we make the
discovery that sparsity promoting regularization effectively recovers the
full-range signal. Within this work, we adopt an optimal nonuniform discrete
fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) implementation of ISAM, which is both fast and
numerically stable throughout iterations. We validate our method with several
complex samples, scanned with a commercial SD-OCT system with no hardware
modification. With this, we both demonstrate full-range ISAM imaging, and
significantly outperform combinations of existing methods.

version of the solution to the original problem, and the latter one may be
retrieved by time-averaging. This yields the existence of a new type of
absolutely continuous in time generalized solutions to the initial-value

is among the most robust, powerful method to constrain primordial black holes
(PBHs) that are a viable candidate of dark matter. If PBHs are in the mass
range $M_{\rm PBH} \lower.5ex\hbox{$\; \buildrel < \over \sim \;$}
10^{-10}M_\odot$, its Schwarzschild radius ($r_{\rm Sch}$) becomes comparable
with or shorter than optical wavelength ($\lambda)$ used in a microlensing
search, and in this regime the wave optics effect on microlensing needs to be
taken into account. For a lensing PBH with mass satisfying $r_{\rm Sch}\sim
\lambda$, it causes a characteristic oscillatory feature in the microlensing
light curve, and it will give a smoking gun evidence of PBH if detected,
because any astrophysical object cannot have such a tiny Schwarzschild radius.
Even in a statistical study, e.g. constraining the abundance of PBHs from a
systematic search of microlensing events for a sample of many source stars, the
wave effect needs to be taken into account. We examine the impact of wave
effect on the PBH constraints obtained from the $r$-band (6210\AA) monitoring
observation of M31 stars in Niikura et al. (2019), and find that a finite
source size effect is dominant over the wave effect for PBHs in the mass range
$M_{\rm PBH}\simeq[10^{-11},10^{-10}]M_\odot$. We also discuss that, if a
denser-cadence (10~sec), $g$-band monitoring observation for a sample of white
dwarfs over a year timescale is available, it would allow one to explore the
wave optics effect on microlensing light curve, if it occurs, or improve the

be applied to stars that exchanged angular momentum with their close
environment. This is especially true for massive close-in planetary companion
(with a periods of few days or less), which could have been strongly impacted
the rotational evolution of the host star, along the stellar evolution, through
the star-planet tidal interaction.
  We showed that the interaction of a close-in massive planet with its host
star can strongly modify the surface rotation rate of this latter, in most of
the cases associated to a planetary engulfment. In such cases, a gyrochronology
analysis of the star would wrongly make it appear as ""rejuvenated"", thus
preventing us to use this method with confidence. To try overcome this issue,
we eventually proposed the proof of concept of a new age determination
technique that we call the tidal-chronology, which is based on the observed
couple $\rm P_{rot,\star}$-$\rm P_{orb}$ of a given star-planet system.
  The gyrochronology technique can only be applied to isolated star or
star-planet systems outside a specific range of $\rm P_{rot,\star}$-$\rm
P_{orb}$. This region tends to expand for increasing stellar and planetary
mass. In that forbidden region, or if any planetary engulfment is suspected,
gyrochronology should be used with extreme caution while tidal-chronology could
be considered. While this technique does not provide a precise age for the
system yet, it is already an extension of gyrochronology and could be helpful
to determine a more precise range of possible age for planetary system composed
of a star between 0.3 and 1.2 $M_{\odot}$ and a planet more massive than 1 $\rm

identified as the glass transition temperature (Tg) emerges, while an
additional parameter for the extension of the super-Arrhenius region is
incorporated. Based on thermodynamic arguments, the dynamical heterogeneities
are then related to structural heterogeneities in a manner consistent with the
idea of a sigmoidal shape in the cohesion energy. Incorporation of this
temperature dependence of the cohesion energy to a Sanchez-Lacombe Equation of

pressure dependence of the density. Moreover, comparison with experimental data

short protocol segments called layers are custom designed to optimize
performance in the common case. When composed with a Byzantine consensus
protocol of choice, they allow considerable control over the tradeoff in the
combined protocol's behavior in the presence of failures and its performance in
their absence. When runs are failure free in the common case, the resulting
protocols decide in two rounds and require $2nt$ bits of communication. For the
common case assumption that all processors propose 1 and no failures occur, we
show a transformation in which decisions are made in one round, and no bits of
communication are exchanged. The resulting protocols achieve better common-case
complexity than all existing Byzantine consensus protocols. Finally, in the
rare instances in which the common case does not occur, a small cost is added
to the complexity of the original consensus protocol being transformed. The key
ingredient of these layers that allows both time and communication efficiency
in the common case is the use of {\it silent confirmation rounds}, which are
rounds where considerable relevant information can be obtained in the absence

concerns about interpretability and accountability of AI have been raised by
influential thinkers. In spite of the recent impact of AI, several works have
identified the need for principled knowledge representation and reasoning
mechanisms integrated with deep learning-based systems to provide sound and
explainable models for such systems. Neural-symbolic computing aims at
integrating, as foreseen by Valiant, two most fundamental cognitive abilities:
the ability to learn from the environment, and the ability to reason from what
has been learned. Neural-symbolic computing has been an active topic of
research for many years, reconciling the advantages of robust learning in
neural networks and reasoning and interpretability of symbolic representation.
In this paper, we survey recent accomplishments of neural-symbolic computing as

illustrate the effectiveness of the approach by outlining the main
characteristics of the methodology: principled integration of neural learning
with symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning allowing for the

each criterion, and then proceeds to the aggregation into a single value. It
rather, makes use of the outranking relations to make a comparison with
reference sets of actions (to which a score is assigned) and proposes a score
range to each alternative, instead of a single value. This is a more robust way
of proceeding given the fragility of a single score. The sets of limiting

are assigned to them through the application of the deck of cards technique.

experiment, namely the electronic structure of dns-Si experiencing energy
offsets of ca. 1 eV as a function of SiO$_2$- vs. Si$_3$N$_4$-embedding with a
few monolayers (MLs). An interface charge transfer (ICT) from dns-Si specific
to the anion type of the dielectric is at the core of this effect and arguably
nested in quantum-chemical properties of oxygen (O) and nitrogen (N) vs. Si. We
investigate the size up to which this energy offset defines the electronic
structure of dns-Si by density functional theory (DFT), considering interface
orientation, embedding layer thickness, and approximants featuring two Si
nanocrystals (NCs); one embedded in SiO$_2$ and the other in Si$_3$N$_4$.
Working with synchrotron ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), we use
SiO$_2$- vs. Si$_3$N$_4$-embedded Si nanowells (NWells) to obtain their energy
of the top valence band states. These results confirm our theoretical findings
and gauge an analytic model for projecting maximum dns-Si sizes for NCs,
nanowires (NWires) and NWells where the energy offset reaches full scale,
yielding to a clear preference for electrons or holes as majority carriers in
dns-Si. Our findings can replace impurity doping for n/p-type dns-Si as used in
ultra-low power electronics and ULSI, eliminating dopant-related issues such as
inelastic carrier scattering, thermal ionization, clustering, out-diffusion and
defect generation. As far as majority carrier preference is concerned, the
elimination of those issues effectively shifts the lower size limit of Si-based
ULSI devices to the crystalization limit of Si of ca. 1.5 nm and enables them
to work also under cryogenic conditions.

nitride and niobium titanium nitride allow to reach the best timing jitter, but
in turn have stronger requirements in terms of film quality to achieve a high

show that a Nb fraction of x = 0.62 allows for the fabrication of detectors
from films as thick as 9 nm and covering an active area of 20 {\mu}m, with a
wide detection saturation plateau at telecom wavelengths and in particular at
1550 nm. This is a signature of an internal detection efficiency saturation,
achieved while maintaining the high time resolution associated with NbTiN and
operation at 2.5K. With our optimized recipe, we reliably fabricated detectors

schemes for one- and two-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamic
equations. The schemes are built on the entropy conservative flux and the
weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) technique as well as explicit
Runge-Kutta time discretization. The key is to technically construct the
affordable entropy conservative flux of the semi-discrete second-order accurate
entropy conservative schemes satisfying the semi-discrete entropy equality for
the found convex entropy pair. As soon as the entropy conservative flux is
derived, the dissipation term can be added to give the semi-discrete entropy
stable schemes satisfying the semi-discrete entropy inequality with the given
convex entropy function. The WENO reconstruction for the scaled entropy
variables and the high-order explicit Runge-Kutta time discretization are
implemented to obtain the fully-discrete high-order schemes. Several numerical
tests are conducted to validate the accuracy and the ability to capture
discontinuities of our entropy stable schemes.

conventional methods, it was difficult to construct an algebraic Reynolds
stress model satisfying the realizability conditions when the model involves
higher-order nonlinear terms on the mean velocity gradient. Such higher-order
nonlinear terms are required to predict turbulent flows with three-dimensional
mean velocity. The present modeling based on the square root tensor enables us
to make the model always satisfy the realizability conditions, even when it

of the model is numerically verified in a turbulent channel flow, a homogeneous
turbulent shear flow, and an axially rotating turbulent pipe flow. The present
model gives a good result in each turbulent flow. Note that the mean swirl flow
in an axially rotating turbulent pipe flow is reproduced because the present

density, Higgs mass, direct detection, collider and LFV constraints. We find
that DM in this model is fermionic for masses below about 1 TeV and scalar

of quantum correlations using nuclear magnetic resonance hardware. Quantum
entanglement, being most common and counter-intuitive, is one of the main type
considered in this thesis. Quantum correlations play a major role in achieving,
the much talked, computational speedup. Creation and detection of such
correlations experimentally is a major thrust area in experimental quantum
information processing field. Main goals of the studies undertaken in this
thesis were to come up with strategies to detect the entanglement in a
'state-independent' way and with low experimental resources. The core of all
the detection protocols is based on our own developed method which enables us
to measure any observable with high accuracy. The experimental protocol has
been successfully implemented to detect the entanglement of random two-qubit
pure states. Further, the schemes for the experimental detection as well as
classification of generic and general three-qubit pure states have also been
devised and implemented successfully. Quantum correlation possessed by mixed
and$/$or separable states e.g. non-classical, bound-entanglement and of
non-local nature were also investigated. In all the investigations, the results
were verified by one or more alternative ways e.g. full quantum state
tomography.

a new industrial revolution called Industry 4.0. This revolution involves
Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS), which consist of intelligent
Cyber-Physical Systems that may be able to adapt themselves autonomously in a
production environment. At the moment, machines in industrial environments are
often not connected to the internet, which thus needs a point-to-point
connection to access the device if necessary. Through Industry 4.0, these
devices should enable remote access for smart maintenance through a connection
to the outside world. However, this connection opens the gate for possible
cyber-attacks and thus raises the question about providing security for these
environments. Therefore, this paper used an adapted approach based on SixSigma
to solve this security problem by investigating security standards. Security
requirements were gathered and mapped to controls from well known security
standards, formed into a catalog. This catalog includes assessment information
to check how secure a solution for a use case is and also includes a link to an
estimation method for implementation cost. Thus this papers outcome shows how
to make Industry 4.0 use cases secure by fulfilling security standard controls

(PDS) of semiconductors at photon energies below the bandgap energy and show
how to extract the actual absorption properties from the measurement data. To
this end, we establish a rigorous computation scheme for the deflection signal
including semi-analytic raytracing to analyze the underlying physical effects.
The computation takes into account linear and nonlinear absorption processes
affecting the refractive index and thus leading to a deflection of the probe
beam. We find that beside the linear mirage effect, nonlinear absorption
mechanisms make a substantial contribution to the signal for strongly focussed
pump beams and sample materials with high two-photon absorption coefficients.
For example, the measured quadratic absorption contribution exceeds 5% at a
pump beam intensity of about ${1.3}\times{10^{5}}\;{W}/{cm^{2}}$ in Si and at
${5}\times{10^{4}}\;{W}/{cm^{2}}$ in GaAs. In addition, our method also
includes thermal expansion effects as well as spatial gradients of the
attenuation properties. We demonstrate that these effects result in an
additional deflection contribution which substantially depends on the distance
of the photodetector from the readout point. This distance dependent
contribution enhances the surface related PDS signal up to two orders of
magnitude and may be misinterpreted as surface absorption if not corrected in
the analysis of the measurement data. We verify these findings by PDS
measurements on crystalline silicon at a wavelength of 1550 nm and provide
guidelines how to extract the actual attenuation coefficient from the PDS
signal.

the fourth cumulant, $c_4$, up to next-to-leading order. Their large-$N_c$

previous findings for $N_f=2$ and $N_f=3$ mass-degenerate flavors --- in the
region $\theta\sim\pi$ two vacuum states coexist, which become degenerate at
$\theta=\pi$. The wall tension of the energy barrier between these degenerate
vacua is determined as well as the decay rate of a false vacuum.

omnipresent at the nanoscale. Scanning probe methods represent a formidable
approach to study these interactions locally. The lateral resolution of such
images is, however, often limited as they are based on measuring the force
(gradient) due to the entire tip interacting with the entire surface. Recently,
we developed scanning quantum dot microscopy (SQDM), a new technique for the
imaging and quantification of surface potentials which is based on the gating
of a nanometer-size tip-attached quantum dot by the local surface potential and
the detection of charge state changes via non-contact atomic force microscopy.
Here, we present a rigorous formalism in the framework of which SQDM can be
understood and interpreted quantitatively. In particular, we present a general
theory of SQDM based on the classical boundary value problem of electrostatics,
which is applicable to the full range of sample properties (conductive vs
insulating, nanostructured vs homogeneously covered). We elaborate the general
theory into a formalism suited for the quantitative analysis of images of
nanostructured but predominantly flat and conductive samples.

and unsupervised learning methods combined together significantly improves the

$-10 \leq b \leq 10)$, with the goal of finding any open clusters that may

successfully applied to TGAS data, adapting it to different density regions.
Our methodology uses an unsupervised, density-based, clustering algorithm,
DBSCAN, that identifies overdensities in the five-dimensional astrometric
parameter space $(l,b,\varpi,\mu_{\alpha^*},\mu_{\delta})$ that may correspond
to physical clusters. The overdensities are separated into physical clusters
(open clusters) or random statistical clusters using an artificial neural
network to recognise the isochrone pattern that open clusters show in a colour
magnitude diagram. The method is able to recover more than 75% of the open
clusters confirmed in the search area. Moreover, we detected 53 open clusters
unknown previous to Gaia DR2, which represents an increase of more than 22%
with respect to the already catalogued clusters in this region. We find that
the census of nearby open clusters is not complete. Different machine learning
methodologies for a blind search of open clusters are complementary to each
other; no single method is able to detect 100% of the existing groups. Our

whether a form of bulk-boundary correspondence holds also in soft matter such

Aerosil-dispersed liquid crystal gels (LC+aerosil) provide a good testing
ground to explore the relation between the controlled variations of the aerosil

with the fractal dimension of the surface. We obtained the surface topography
of our gel samples with different quenched random disorder strengths by using
atomic force microscope techniques, and computed the fractal dimension for each

fulfills full automation, support of highly heterogeneous entities, and massive
parallelization of the ER process. MinoanER leverages a token-based similarity
of entities to define a new metric that derives the similarity of neighboring
entities from the most important relations, as they are indicated only by
statistics. A composite blocking method is employed to capture different
sources of matching evidence from the content, neighbors, or names of entities.
The search space of candidate pairs for comparison is compactly abstracted by a
novel disjunctive blocking graph and processed by a non-iterative, massively
parallel matching algorithm that consists of four generic, schema-agnostic
matching rules that are quite robust with respect to their internal
configuration. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of MinoanER is comparable
to existing ER tools over real KBs exhibiting low Variety, but it outperforms
them significantly when matching KBs with high Variety.

increase. On the one hand, the relation among the extracted gait features
including body sway, stride length, frequency and speed has been illustrated.
On the other hand, the walking direction can be featured by three critical
evading points where apparent change of walking direction could be observed.
Gaussian function has been used to fit the walking direction, thus allowing to
estimate the three critical points and examine their variation with the
increase of obstacle size. Furthermore, the direct-indirect evading and
left-right turning preference as well as the possible psychological motivations

a higher walking efficiency and right-turning pedestrians have a stronger
tendency to behave `direct'. Results of this paper are expected to provide

explainability and transparency of their decisions. This significantly hampers
their deployment in environments where explainability is essential along with
the accuracy of the system. Recently, significant efforts have been made for
the interpretability of these deep networks with the aim to open up the
black-box. However, most of these approaches are specifically developed for
visual modalities. In addition, the interpretations provided by these systems
require expert knowledge and understanding for intelligibility. This indicates
a vital gap between the explainability provided by the systems and the novice
user. To bridge this gap, we present a novel framework i.e. Time-Series
eXplanation (TSXplain) system which produces a natural language based
explanation of the decision taken by a NN. It uses the extracted statistical
features to describe the decision of a NN, merging the deep learning world with
that of statistics. The two-level explanation provides ample description of the
decision made by the network to aid an expert as well as a novice user alike.
Our survey and reliability assessment test confirm that the generated
explanations are meaningful and correct. We believe that generating natural
language based descriptions of the network's decisions is a big step towards
opening up the black-box.

proposed for generating families of one-dimensional nested quadrature rules

procedure: we start with a high-degree quadrature rule with positive weights
and remove nodes while preserving symmetry and positivity. This is shown to be
always possible, by a lemma depending primarily on Carath\'eodory's theorem.
The resulting one-dimensional rules can be used within a Smolyak procedure to
produce sparse multi-dimensional rules, but weight positivity is lost then. As
a remedy, the reduction procedure is directly applied to multi-dimensional
tensor-product cubature rules. This allows to produce a family of sparse
cubature rules with positive weights, competitive with Smolyak rules. Finally
the positivity constraint is relaxed to allow more flexibility in the removal
of nodes. This gives a second family of sparse cubature rules, in which
iteratively as many nodes as possible are removed. The new quadrature and
cubature rules are applied to test problems from mathematics and fluid
dynamics. Their performance is compared with that of the tensor-product and
standard Clenshaw-Curtis Smolyak cubature rule.

data-driven architectures with the classical optimization algorithms have been
proposed and explored, showing superior empirical performance in solving

analysis about the convergence behaviors of learning-based optimization. In
particular, most existing analyses are specific to unconstrained problems but
cannot apply to the more general cases where some variables of interest are
subject to certain constraints. In this paper, we propose Differentiable
Linearized ADMM (D-LADMM) for solving the problems with linear constraints.
Specifically, D-LADMM is a K-layer LADMM inspired deep neural network, which is
obtained by firstly introducing some learnable weights in the classical
Linearized ADMM algorithm and then generalizing the proximal operator to some
learnable activation function. Notably, we rigorously prove that there exist a
set of learnable parameters for D-LADMM to generate globally converged
solutions, and we show that those desired parameters can be attained by
training D-LADMM in a proper way. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to provide the convergence analysis for the learning-based optimization

5G systems, but also a concept applicable to other wireless systems. Exploiting

achieving high spectral efficiency, high data rates and extreme spatial
multiplexing of densely distributed users. On the one hand, the benefits of
applying massive MIMO for broadband communication are well known and there has
been a large body of research on designing communication schemes to support
high rates. On the other hand, using massive MIMO for Internet-of-Things (IoT)
is still a developing topic, as IoT connectivity has requirements and
constraints that are significantly different from the broadband connections. In
this paper we investigate the applicability of massive MIMO to IoT
connectivity. Specifically, we treat the two generic types of IoT connections
envisioned in 5G: massive machine-type communication (mMTC) and ultra-reliable
low-latency communication (URLLC). This paper fills this important gap by
identifying the opportunities and challenges in exploiting massive MIMO for IoT
connectivity. We provide insights into the trade-offs that emerge when massive
MIMO is applied to mMTC or URLLC and present a number of suitable communication
schemes. The discussion continues to the questions of network slicing of the
wireless resources and the use of massive MIMO to simultaneously support IoT
connections with very heterogeneous requirements. The main conclusion is that
massive MIMO can bring benefits to the scenarios with IoT connectivity, but it
requires tight integration of the physical-layer techniques with the protocol
design.

Conceiving in terms of the underlying Background Independence aspect - the
titular Configurational Relationalism - serves moreover to remove 2) as well.
This is implemented by the $G$-act, $G$-all method. I.e. given an object $O$
that is not $G$-invariant, we act on it with $G$ and then apply an operation
involving the whole group. This has the effect of double-cancelling the
introduction of our group action, thus yielding a $G$-independent version of
$O$. A first example of whole-group operation is group averaging. This is a
valuable prototype by its familiarity to a large proportion of Mathematics and
Physics majors through featuring in elementary Group Theory and Representation
Theory courses (and which can be traced back to Cauchy). In particular, this is
much more familiar than Thin Sandwiches or Best Matching! Secondly,
extremization over the group, of which Best Matching, and taking infs or sups
over the group, are examples. Some further significant examples of this method
in modern geometry and topology include those of Kendall, Younes, Hausdorff and
Gromov. In this way, we populate this approach with examples well beyond the
usual GR literature's by DeWitt, Barbour and Fischer (which we also outline).

negative-\textit{U} behavior of the O vacancy, and the polaronic nature of the
Zn vacancy. The thermodynamic charge-state transition levels associated with
the negative-\textit{U} behavior $\varepsilon$($0$/$2-$),

to the conduction band and the magnitude of \textit{U} is lowered compared to
the values for the O vacancy. Further, the interaction with hydrogen has been
explored, where it is shown that the divacancy can accommodate up to three H
atoms. The first two H atoms prefer to terminate O dangling bonds at the Zn
vacancy, while the geometrical location of the third depends on the Fermi-level
position. The calculated electrical properties of the divacancy are in

origin that precludes a description of such systems in terms of bipartite or
multipartite processes, as is usually done in the framework of stochastic
and/or information thermodynamics. This means that fluctuations in each
subsystem are not independent: subsystems jump simultaneously if the dynamics
is modeled as a Markov jump process, or noises are correlated for diffusion
processes. In this paper, we consider information and thermodynamic exchanges
between a pair of coupled systems that do not satisfy the bipartite property.
The generalization of information-theoretic measures, such as learning rates
and transfer entropy rates, to this situation is non-trivial and also involves
introducing several additional rates. We describe how this can be achieved in
the framework of general continuous-time Markov processes, without restricting
the study to the steady-state regime. We illustrate our general formalism on
the case of diffusion processes and derive an extension of the second law of
information thermodynamics in which the difference of transfer entropy rates in
the forward and backward time directions replaces the learning rate. As a side
result, we also generalize an important relation linking information theory and
estimation theory. To further obtain analytical expressions we treat in detail
the case of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, and discuss the ability of the
various information measures to detect a directional coupling in the presence
of correlated noises. Finally, we apply our formalism to the analysis of the
directional influence between cellular processes in a concrete example, which
also requires considering the case of a non-bipartite and non-Markovian
process.

baryon decays play an important role in particle phenomenology since they allow
to study the interplay of long and short distance dynamics of the Standard
Model (SM). Further, they allow one to search for New Physics effects beyond
the SM. We review recent progress in experimental and theoretical studies of
the nonleptonic decays of heavy baryons with a focus on double charm baryon
states and their decays. In particular, we discuss new ideas proposed by the
present authors to calculate the $W$-exchange matrix elements of the
nonleptonic decays of double heavy baryons. An important ingredient in our
approach is the compositeness condition of Salam and Weinberg, and an effective
implementation of infrared confinement both of which allow one to describe the
nonperturbative structure of baryons composed of light and heavy quarks.
Further we discuss an ab initio calculational method for the treatment of the
so-called $W$-exchange diagrams generated by $W^{\pm}$ boson exchange between
quarks. We found that the $W^{\pm}$-exchange contributions are not suppressed
in comparison with the tree-level (factrorizing) diagrams and must be taken
into account in the evaluation of matrix elements. Moreover, there are decay
processes such as the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed decay $\Xi_c^+ \to p \phi$
recently observed by the LHCb Collaboration which is contributed to only by one
single $W$-exchange diagram.

covariates continues to be an important problem both theoretically and in

depend on the interplay between the Bayes factor learning rate and the
penalization on model complexity. In this work, we present results for the
Zellner-Siow prior for regression coefficients paired with a Poisson prior for
model complexity. We show that model selection consistency restricts the
dimension of the true model from increasing too quickly. Further, we show that
the additional contribution to the mean structure from new covariates must be
large enough to overcome the complexity penalty. The average Bayes factors for
different sets of models involves random variables over the choices of columns
from the design matrix. We show that a large class these random variables have
no moments asymptotically and need to be analyzed using stable laws. We derive
the domain of attraction for these random variables and obtain conditions on
the design matrix that provide for the control of false discoveries.

multiple neural populations. Gaining insights in the organization and dynamics
of such populations can best be studied with broadband intracranial recordings
of so-called extracellular field potential, reflecting neuronal spiking as well
as mesoscopic activities, such as waves, oscillations, intrinsic large
deflections, and multiunit spiking activity. Such signals are critical for our
understanding of how neuronal ensembles encode sensory information and how such
information is integrated in the large networks underlying cognition. The
aforementioned principles are now well accepted, yet the efficacy of extracting
information out of the complex neural data, and their employment for improving
our understanding of neural networks, critically depends on the mathematical
processing steps ranging from simple detection of action potentials in noisy
traces - to fitting advanced mathematical models to distinct patterns of the
neural signal potentially underlying intra-processing of information, e.g.
interneuronal interactions. Here, we present a robust strategy for detecting
signals in broadband and noisy time series such as spikes, sharp waves and
multi-unit activity data that is solely based on the intrinsic statistical
distribution of the recorded data. By using so-called higher criticism - a
second-level significance testing procedure comparing the fraction of observed
significances to an expected fraction under the global null - we are able to
detect small signals in correlated noisy time-series without prior filtering,
denoising or data regression. Results demonstrate the efficiency and
reliability of the method and versatility over a wide range of experimental
conditions and suggest the appropriateness of higher criticism to characterize
neuronal dynamics without prior manipulation of the data.

effect on photoacoustic signal generation. Moreover, our model shows that the
presence of a silica coating causes a reduction in the PA signal amplitude,
with the level of signal reduction increasing with thicker silica coating. Our
theoretical predictions are qualitatively consistent with our experimental
results, where suspensions of in-house-synthesized and commercially available
silica-coated gold nanosphere suspensions were excited with nanosecond-pulsed

displacements and deformations in a non-intrusive manner. By comparing two
images, one of the undeformed reference state of a specimen and another of the
deformed target state, the relative displacement between those two states is
determined. DIC is well known and often used for post-processing analysis of
in-plane displacements and deformation of specimen. Increasing the analysis
speed to enable real-time DIC analysis will be beneficial and extend the field
of use of this technique. Here we tested several combinations of the most
common DIC methods in combination with different parallelization approaches in
MATLAB and evaluated their performance to determine whether real-time analysis
is possible with these methods. To reflect improvements in computing technology
different hardware settings were also analysed. We found that implementation
problems can reduce the efficiency of a theoretically superior algorithm such
that it becomes practically slower than a sub-optimal algorithm. The
Newton-Raphson algorithm in combination with a modified Particle Swarm
algorithm in parallel image computation was found to be most effective. This is
contrary to theory, suggesting that the inverse-compositional Gauss-Newton
algorithm is superior. As expected, the Brute Force Search algorithm is the
least effective method. We also found that the correct choice of
parallelization tasks is crucial to achieve improvements in computing speed. A
poorly chosen parallelisation approach with high parallel overhead leads to
inferior performance. Finally, irrespective of the computing mode the correct
choice of combinations of integer-pixel and sub-pixel search algorithms is
decisive for an efficient analysis. Using currently available hardware
real-time analysis at high framerates remains an aspiration.

Research (CERN), protons and heavy ions are accelerated to velocities close to
the speed of light and collided in order to study particle interactions and
give us an insight to the fundamental laws of nature. The energy and intensity
of the particle beams at the LHC are unprecedented, and a tremendous amount of
data is collected by three experiments on the circular ring of the LHC that are
specialized in proton-proton collisions. The data confirm the most successful
theory of particle physics to date known as the standard model of particle
physics to very good precision, including the long expected and recently
discovered Higgs boson. The standard model cannot, however, accommodate
experimentally observed phenomena like gravity, neutrino masses, and dark
matter. The theory can also be theoretically unsatisfying as a result of
parameters that go unexplained, such as the relatively low value of the Higgs
mass despite its large quantum corrections, implying a lack of understanding.
For this reason, in addition to precision measurements of standard model
observables, experiments search for new physics beyond the standard model that
could explain some of the shortcomings of the standard model. A selection of
results for searches for new physics beyond the standard model using data
recorded by three experiments on the LHC are presented in this talk.

universe when the particles have a finite diffusion length. Assuming that
annihilations are impossible when the mean separation of the particles is
larger than their diffusion length, we derive a version of the Boltzmann
equation for freeze out in this scenario and an approximate solution, accurate
to better than 2\%. The effect of a finite diffusion length is to increase the
final relic freeze-out abundance over its corresponding value when diffusion
effects are ignored. When diffusion is limited only by scattering off of the
thermal background, and the annihilation cross section is bounded by unitarity,
a significant effect on the freeze-out abundance requires a scattering cross
section much larger than the annihilation cross section. A similar effect is
demonstrated when the relic particles are produced via the freeze-in mechanism,
but in this case the finite diffusion length is due to the scattering of
particles that annihilate into the relic particle of interest. For freeze in,
the effect of a finite diffusion length is to reduce the final relic particle
abundance. The effects of a finite diffusion length are most important when the
scattering cross section or the relic mass are very large. While we have not
found a particularly compelling example where this would affect previous
results, with the current interest in new dark matter candidates it could
become an important consideration.

derived from a common deep architecture, each one specialized to perform a task
in a certain domain (e.g., photos, sketches, paintings). This paper tackles MDL
with a particular interest in obtaining domain-specific models with an
adjustable budget in terms of the number of network parameters and
computational complexity. Our intuition is that, as in real applications the
number of domains and tasks can be very large, an effective MDL approach should
not only focus on accuracy but also on having as few parameters as possible. To
implement this idea we derive specialized deep models for each domain by
adapting a pre-trained architecture but, differently from other methods, we
propose a novel strategy to automatically adjust the computational complexity
of the network. To this aim, we introduce Budget-Aware Adapters that select the
most relevant feature channels to better handle data from a novel domain. Some
constraints on the number of active switches are imposed in order to obtain a
network respecting the desired complexity budget. Experimentally, we show that
our approach leads to recognition accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art
approaches but with much lighter networks both in terms of storage and
computation.

possible definitions of the underlying homotopy type of a log scheme. We show
that, up to profinite completion, they all yield the same result, and thus
arrive at an unambiguous definition of the profinite homotopy type of a log
scheme. Specifically, in [6], we define this to be the profinite \'etale
homotopy type of the infinite root stack, and show that, over $\mathbb{C},$
this agrees up to profinite completion with the Kato-Nakayama space. Other
possible candidates are the profinite shape of the Kummer \'etale site
$X_{\mbox{k\'et}},$ or of the representable \'etale site of $\sqrt[\infty]{X}.$
Our main result is that all of these notions agree, and moreover the profinite
\'etale homotopy type of the infinite root stack is not sensitive to whether or
not it is viewed as a pro-system in stacks, or as an actual stack (by taking
the limit of the pro-system). We furthermore show that in the log regular
setting, all these notions also agree with the \'etale homotopy type of the
classical locus $X^{\mbox{triv}}$ (up to an appropriate completion). We deduce
that, over an arbitrary locally Noetherian base, the \'etale homotopy type of
$\mathbb{G}_m^N$ agrees with that of $B\mu_\infty^N$ up to completion.

  In this article, we model a sequence of credit card transactions from three
different perspectives, namely (i) does the sequence contain a Fraud? (ii) Is
the sequence obtained by fixing the card-holder or the payment terminal? (iii)
Is it a sequence of spent amount or of elapsed time between the current and
previous transactions? Combinations of the three binary perspectives give eight
sets of sequences from the (training) set of transactions. Each one of these
sets is modelled with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Each HMM associates a
likelihood to a transaction given its sequence of previous transactions. These
likelihoods are used as additional features in a Random Forest classifier for
fraud detection. This multiple perspectives HMM-based approach enables an
automatic feature engineering in order to model the sequential properties of
the dataset with respect to the classification task. This strategy allows for a

should be guided by task-based measures of image quality (IQ). Task-based
measures of IQ quantify the ability of an observer to perform a specific task
such as detection or estimation of a signal (e.g., a tumor). For binary signal
detection tasks, the Bayesian Ideal Observer (IO) sets an upper limit of
observer performance and has been advocated for use in optimizing medical
imaging systems and data-acquisition designs. Except in special cases,
determination of the IO test statistic is analytically intractable.
Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques can be employed to approximate IO
detection performance, but their reported applications have been limited to
relatively simple object models. In cases where the IO test statistic is
difficult to compute, the Hotelling Observer (HO) can be employed. To compute
the HO test statistic, potentially large covariance matrices must be accurately
estimated and subsequently inverted, which can present computational
challenges. This work investigates supervised learning-based methodologies for
approximating the IO and HO test statistics. Convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and single-layer neural networks (SLNNs) are employed to approximate the
IO and HO test statistics, respectively. Numerical simulations were conducted
for both signal-known-exactly (SKE) and signal-known-statistically (SKS) signal
detection tasks. The performances of the supervised learning methods are
assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and the results
are compared to those produced by use of traditional numerical methods or
analytical calculations when feasible. The potential advantages of the proposed
supervised learning approaches for approximating the IO and HO test statistics
are discussed.

due to its huge potential application in large-scale intelligent transportation
systems. However, most of the previous methods only considered the taxi demand
prediction in origin regions, but neglected the modeling of the specific
situation of the destination passengers. We believe it is suboptimal to
preallocate the taxi into each region based solely on the taxi origin demand.
In this paper, we present a challenging and worth-exploring task, called taxi
origin-destination demand prediction, which aims at predicting the taxi demand
between all region pairs in a future time interval. Its main challenges come
from how to effectively capture the diverse contextual information to learn the
demand patterns. We address this problem with a novel Contextualized
Spatial-Temporal Network (CSTN), which consists of three components for the
modeling of local spatial context (LSC), temporal evolution context (TEC) and
global correlation context (GCC) respectively. Firstly, an LSC module utilizes
two convolution neural networks to learn the local spatial dependencies of taxi
demand respectively from the origin view and the destination view. Secondly, a
TEC module incorporates both the local spatial features of taxi demand and the
meteorological information to a Convolutional Long Short-term Memory Network
(ConvLSTM) for the analysis of taxi demand evolution. Finally, a GCC module is
applied to model the correlation between all regions by computing a global
correlation feature as a weighted sum of all regional features, with the
weights being calculated as the similarity between the corresponding region
pairs. Extensive experiments and evaluations on a large-scale dataset well
demonstrate the superiority of our CSTN over other compared methods for taxi

To alleviate the impact of randomness, secondly, the stacking strategy is
employed to formulate a more general network structure. Different from other

be easily obtained through its ANOVA decomposition (or interaction matrix). The
interpretability can then be used as a suggestion for input variable selection.
The EHH neural network is applied in nonlinear system identification, the

of SM has been studied mostly in a two-miners scenario, it has not been
investigated in a more practical context where there are multiple malicious

  To fill this gap, we carry out an empirical study that separately accounts
for different numbers of SM miners (who always perform SM) and strategic miners
(who choose either SM or Nakamoto's mining protocol depending on which

  Our result shows that SM is generally more effective as the number of SM
miners increases, however its effectiveness does not vary in the presence of a
large number of strategic miners. Under specific mining power distributions, we
also demonstrate that multiple miners can perform SM and simultaneously gain
higher mining rewards than they should. Surprisingly, we also show that the
more strategic miners there are, the more robust the systems become. Since
blockchain miners should naturally be seen as self-interested strategic miners,
our findings encourage blockchain system developers and engineers to attract as
many miners as possible to prevent SM and similar behaviour.

casting doubts on their robustness. In particular, biomass conversion

certainly key for food webs adaptive evolution because realistic food webs can

how biomass flows into food webs in models. On the other hand, we question more
generally the robustness of evolutionary models for the study of food webs.

we propose a method that combines the support vector machine and

The SVM technique is introduced to pick out a sub-range in the rough ranges of
parameters, in which an arbitrary selected initial solution for the LM

builds on the additive factor models and includes a representation of the
temporal distribution of past practice on the skills involved by an item. In
particular, DAS3H allows the learning and forgetting curves to differ from one
skill to another. Finally, we provide empirical evidence on three real-world

suitable for clinical use. TOPI relies on high-angle oblique illumination of
the retina, combined with adaptive optics, to enhance the phase contrast of
transparent cells. We first present in-vivo images of retinal cells, from the
retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) to the nerve and vascular layers of the
retina, in eleven healthy volunteers without pupil dilation. The morphology of
the cells in vivo is then compared to that of images obtained with the same
technique applied on ex vivo human RPE and pig retinas. Finally, we demonstrate
the ability of high resolution phase microscopy to image pericytes and
microglia around rat retinal capillaries. Our results show the ability of TOPI
to image and quantify retinal cells up to the RPE depth within a maximum time
of 9 seconds over a field of view of 4.4 x 4.4{\deg}, opening new avenue in the
in vivo exploration of the deepest layer of the retina in healthy and diseased
eyes.

More specifically, using combinatorial identities, we show that FES can be
viewed as ""ball-in-box"" models with appropriate weighting on the set of
occupancy configurations (merely represented by a partition of the total number
of particles). As a consequence, the following exact statement of the
generalized Pauli principle is derived: for an $N$-particles system exhibiting
FES of extended parameter \mbox{$g=q/r$} ($q$ and $r$ are co-prime integers
such that $0 < q \leq r$), (1)~the allowed occupation number of a state is less
than or equal to $r-q+1$ and \emph{not} to $1/g$ whenever $q\neq 1$ and (2)~the
global occupancy shape is admissible if the number of states occupied by at
least two particles is less than or equal to $(N-1)/r$ ($N \equiv 1 \mod r$).
These counting rules allow distinguishing infinitely many families of FES
systems depending on the parameter $g$ and the size $N$.

pixel set of x into multiple blocks and evaluates, for each block, its
contribution to the maximum probability. A masked data sample x_ROI is
generated by replacing blocks with relatively small degrees of contribution
with random images. Then, ROIreg trains CNN so that g(x_ROI ) does not change
as much as possible from g(x). Therefore, ROIreg can be said to refine the
classification ability of CNN more. On the other hand, Virtual Adverserial
Training (VAT), which is an excellent semi-supervised learning method,
generates data sample x_VAT by perturbing x in the direction in which g(x)
changes most. Then, VAT trains CNN so that g(x_VAT ) does not change from g(x)
as much as possible. Therefore, VAT can be said to be a method to improve CNN's
weakness. Thus, ROIreg and VAT have complementary training effects. In fact,
the combination of VAT and ROIreg improves the results obtained when using VAT
or ROIreg alone. This combination also improves the state-of-the-art on ""SVHN
with and without data augmentation"" and ""CIFAR-10 without data augmentation"".
We also propose a method called ROI augmentation (ROIaug) as a method to apply
ROIreg to data augmentation in supervised learning. However, the evaluation
function used there is different from the standard cross-entropy. ROIaug
improves the performance of supervised learning for both SVHN and CIFAR-10.
Finally, we investigate the performance degradation of VAT and VAT+ROIreg when

to operate on a multidisciplinary level to identify propeller shapes that lead
to reduced tip vortex-induced pressure and increased efficiency without
altering the thrust. First, a specific tool for the bottom-up construction of
parameterized propeller blade geometries has been developed. The algorithm
proposed operates with a user defined number of arbitrary shaped or NACA
airfoil sections, and employs arbitrary degree NURBS to represent the chord,
pitch, skew and rake distribution as a function of the blade radial coordinate.
The control points of such curves have been modified to generate, in a fully
automated way, a family of blade geometries depending on as many as 20 shape
parameters. Such geometries have then been used to carry out potential flow
simulations with the Boundary Element Method based software PROCAL. Given the
high number of parameters considered, such a preliminary stage allowed for a
fast evaluation of the performance of several hundreds of shapes. In addition,
the data obtained from the potential flow simulation allowed for the
application of a parameter space reduction methodology based on active
subspaces (AS) property, which suggested that the main propeller performance
indices are, at a first but rather accurate approximation, only depending on a
single parameter which is a linear combination of all the original geometric
ones. AS analysis has also been used to carry out a constrained optimization
exploiting response surface method in the reduced parameter space, and a
sensitivity analysis based on such surrogate model. The few selected shapes
were finally used to set up high fidelity RANS simulations and select an
optimal shape.

  spectroscopy","Post review version",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In Broadband Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy, the intrinsic limit given by the
laser shot noise is seldom reached due to the electronic noise of the front-end
amplifier and the intensity fluctuations of the laser source. In this paper we
present a low-noise multi-channel acquisition system, with an
integration-oriented design, able to compensate the common-mode fluctuations of
the laser output power with the pseudo-differential structure and reach a
sensitivity better than 10 ppm thanks to the lock-in technique.

  Communications Infrastructure",,,,,"cs.DC eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Interest in smart cities is rapidly rising due to the global rise in
urbanization and the wide-scale instrumentation of modern cities. Due to the
considerable infrastructural cost of setting up smart cities and smart
communities, researchers are exploring the use of existing vehicles on the
roads as ""message ferries"" for the transport data for smart community
applications to avoid the cost of installing new communication infrastructure.
In this paper, we propose an opportunistic data ferry selection algorithm that
strives to select vehicles that can minimize the overall delay for data
delivery from a source to a given destination. Our proposed opportunistic
algorithm utilizes an ensemble of online hiring algorithms, which are run
together in passive mode, to select the online hiring algorithm that has
performed the best in recent history. The proposed ensemble based algorithm is
evaluated empirically using real-world traces from taxies plying routes in
Shanghai, China, and its performance is compared against a baseline of four
state-of-the-art online hiring algorithms. A number of experiments are
conducted and our results indicate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the
overall delay compared to the baseline by an impressive 13% to 258%.

  Aligned Key Iterative Algorithm",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present importance aligned key iterative algorithm for extractive
summarization that is faster than conventional algorithms keeping its accuracy.
The computational complexity of our algorithm is O($SNlogN$) to summarize
original $N$ sentences into final $S$ sentences. Our algorithm maximizes the
weighted dissimilarity defined by the product of importance and cosine
dissimilarity so that the summary represents the document and at the same time
the sentences of the summary are not similar to each other. The weighted
dissimilarity is heuristically maximized by iterative greedy search and binary
search to the sentences ordered by importance. We finally show a benchmark
score based on summarization of customer reviews of products, which highlights
the quality of our algorithm comparable to human and existing algorithms. We
provide the source code of our algorithm on github

specified by MSO-transducers, streaming $\omega$-string transducers as well as
deterministic two-way transducers with look-ahead. In their one-way
restriction, the latter transducers define the class of rational functions.
Even though regular functions are robustly characterised by several
finite-state devices, even the subclass of rational functions may contain
functions which are not computable (by a Turing machine with infinite input).
This paper proposes a decision procedure for the following synthesis problem:
given a regular function $f$ (equivalently specified by one of the
aforementioned transducer model), is $f$ computable and if it is, synthesize a
Turing machine computing it.
  For regular functions, we show that computability is equivalent to
continuity, and therefore the problem boils down to deciding continuity. We
establish a generic characterisation of continuity for functions preserving
regular languages under inverse image (such as regular functions). We exploit
this characterisation to show the decidability of continuity (and hence
computability) of rational and regular functions. For rational functions, we
show that this can be done in $\mathsf{NLogSpace}$ (it was already known to be
in $\mathsf{PTime}$ by Prieur). In a similar fashion, we also effectively
characterise uniform continuity of regular functions, and relate it to the
notion of uniform computability, which offers stronger efficiency guarantees.

have attracted a considerable attention in cancer research. Yet some important
challenges are still to be faced, including an optimal coupling between these
two types of properties that would be effective within complex biological
tissues. To address these points, we have prepared novel nanoplatforms
associating controlled drug delivery of doxorubicin and Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) contrast-enhancement that exhibit high specificity towards cancer
cells compared to normal cells and evaluated them both in 2D cultures and
within 3D tissue-like biomimetic matrices. Methods: Nanoplatforms were prepared
from hollow silica nanoparticles coated with MnO2 nanosheets and conjugated
with the AS1411 aptamer as a targeting agent. They were fully characterized
from a chemical and structural point of view as well as for drug release and
MRI signal enhancement. Standard two-dimensional monolayer cultures were
performed using HeLa and Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts (NHDF) cells to
testify targeting and cytotoxicity. Cellularized type I collagen-based
hydrogels were also used to study nanoparticles behavior in 3D biomimetic
environments. Results: The as-established nanoplatforms can enter HeLa cells,
leading to the dissociation of the MnO2 nanosheets into Mn 2+ that enhanced T1
magnetic resonance signals and concomitantly release doxorubicin, both effects
being markedly more significant than in the presence of NHDFs. Moreover,
particles functionality and specificity were preserved when the cells were
immobilized within type I collagen-based fibrillar hydrogels. Conclusion: The
use of MnO2 nanosheets as glutathione-sensitive coatings of drug loaded
nanoparticles together with surface conjugation with a targeting aptamer offers
an effective strategy to obtain efficient and specific nanotheranostic systems
for cancer research, both in 2D and 3D. The here-described tissue-like models
should be easy to implement and could constitute an interesting intermediate
validation step for newly-developed theranostic nanoparticles before in vivo
evaluation.
