  Optimization","Computer Networks",,"10.1016/j.comnet.2019.04.009",,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Long-term evolution (LTE) and LTE-advance (LTE-A) are widely used efficient
network technologies serving billions of users, since they are featured with
high spectrum efficiency, less latency, and higher bandwidth. Despite
remarkable advantages offered by these technologies, signaling overhead remains
a major issue in accessing the network. In particular, the load of signaling is
mainly attributed to location management. This paper proposes an efficient
approach for minimizing the total signaling overhead of location management in
LTE networks using multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO).
Tracking area update (TAU) and paging are considered to be the main elements of
the signaling overhead of optimal location management in LTE. In addition, the
total inter-list handover contributes significantly to the total signaling
overhead. However, the total signaling cost of TAU and paging is adversely
related to the total inter-list handover. Two cost functions should be
minimized, the first is the total signaling cost of TAU and paging and the
second is the total signaling overhead. The trade-off between these two
objectives can be circumvented by MOPSO, which alleviates the total signaling
overhead. A set of non-dominated solutions on the Pareto-optimal front is
defined and the best compromise solution. The proposed algorithm results
feasible compromise solution, minimizing the signaling overhead and the
consumption of the power battery of a user. The efficacy and the robustness of
the proposed algorithm have been proven using large scale environment problem
illustrative example. The location management in LTE networks using MOPSO best
compromise solution has been compared to a mixed integer non-linear programming

environment has a strong effect on the local electronic structure and hence the
optical properties of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides that are
determined by strong Coulomb interaction. Here, we examine the role of the
substrate material and intrinsic defects in monolayer MoS2 crystals on SiO2 and
hBN substrates using a combination of scanning tunneling spectroscopy, scanning
tunneling microscopy, optical absorbance, and low-temperature photoluminescence
measurements. We find that the different substrates significantly impact the
optical properties and the local density of states near the conduction band
edge observed in tunneling spectra. While the SiO2 substrates induce a large
background doping with electrons and a substantial amount of band tail states
near the conduction band edge of MoS2, such states as well as the high doping
density are absent using high quality hBN substrates. By accounting for the
substrate effects we obtain a quasiparticle gap that is in excellent agreement
with optical absorbance spectra and we deduce an exciton binding energy of
about 480 meV. We identify several intrinsic lattice defects that are
ubiquitious in MoS2, but we find that on hBN substrates the impact of these
defects appears to be passivated. We conclude that the choice of substrate
controls both the effects of intrinsic defects and extrinsic disorder, and thus
the electronic and optical properties of MoS2. The correlation of substrate
induced disorder and defects on the electronic and optical properties of MoS2
contributes to an in-depth understanding of the role of the substrates on the
performance of 2D materials and will help to further improve the properties of
2D materials based quantum nanosystems.

\AA and Fe I 6302 \AA lines were observed and a series of test pixels was
inverted using the Stockholm inversion code. Our analysis revealed for the
first time that PMJs are visible in H\alpha, where they appear as dark features
with average line-of-sight (LOS) upflows of 1.1\pm0.6 km/s, matching the LOS
velocities from the inversions. Based on the H\alpha observations we extend the
previous average length and lifetime of PMJs to 2815\pm530 km and 163\pm25 s,
respectively. The plane-of-sky (POS) velocities of our PMJs of up to 17 km/s
tend to give increased velocities with distance travelled. Furthermore, two of
our PMJs with significant Stokes V signal indicate that the PMJs possess an
increased LOS magnetic field of up to 100 G compared to the local pre-/post-
PMJ magnetic field, which propagates as quickly as the PMJs' POS velocities.
Finally, we present evidence that PMJs display an on average 1 minute gradual
precursory brightening that only manifests itself in the cores of the Ca II
lines. We conclude that PMJs are not ordinary jets but likely are
manifestations of heat fronts that propagate at the local Alfven velocity.

variability, forming an unbiased sample down to the brown dwarf regime. The
K-band luminosity function in Tr 37 is similar to that of IC 348 but shifted to
somewhat brighter values, implying that the K- and M-type members of Tr 37 are
younger than those in IC 348. We introduce methods to classify the causes of
variability, based on behavior in the color-color and color-magnitude diagrams.
Accretion hot spots cause larger variations at J than at K with substantial
scatter in the diagrams; there are at least a dozen, with the most active
resembling EXors. Eleven sources are probably dominated by intervention of dust
clumps in their circumstellar disks with color behavior indicating the presence
of grains larger than for interstellar dust, presumably due to grain growth in
their disks. Thirteen sources have larger variations at K than at J or H. For
11 of them, the temperature fitted to the variable component is very close to
2000K, suggesting that the changes in output are caused by turbulence at the
inner rim of the circumstellar disk exposing previously protected populations
of grains.

approaches enable the asymmetric execution of a relative motion task, and show
how an asymmetric relative motion space can be defined. We leverage this result
to propose an extended relative Jacobian to model the cooperative system, which
allows a user to set a concrete degree of asymmetry in the task execution. This
is achieved without the need for prescribing an absolute motion target.
Instead, the absolute motion remains available as a functional redundancy to
the system. We illustrate the properties of our proposed Jacobian through
numerical simulations of a novel differential Inverse Kinematics algorithm.

$k$ given in the interval above. Based on these facts, lower bounds on
$\gamma_{k}^{o}(D)$ with characterizations of all digraphs attaining the bounds
are given in this work. We also bound this parameter for bipartite digraphs
from above. For the particular case $k=1$, an immediate result from the

in which $\gamma(D)$ stands for the domination number of $D$. We show that
these two digraph parameters are the same for some infinite families of
digraphs like rooted trees and contrafunctional digraphs. Moreover, we show

arbitrary large for directed trees and connected functional digraphs.

Conversely, an asymmetric solution to the relative motion task will result in
conflicts with the absolute task. In this work, we address the problem of

characterized by temperature and density inhomogeneities including structures,
or ""clumps"", of colder, more dense material embedded in the photoionized gas.
As these clumps pass our line of sight, absorption dips appear in the light
curve. We characterize the properties of the clumps through spectral changes
during various dip stages. Comparing the silicon and sulfur absorption line
regions (1.6-2.7 keV $\equiv$ 7.7-4.6 {\AA}) in four levels of varying column
depth reveals the presence of lower ionization stages, i.e., colder or denser
material, in the deeper dip phases. The Doppler velocities of the lines are
roughly consistent within each observation, varying with the respective orbital
phase. This is consistent with the picture of a structure that consists of
differently ionized material, in which shells of material facing the black hole
shield the inner and back shells from the ionizing radiation. The variation of
the Doppler velocities compared to a toy model of the stellar wind, however,
does not allow us to pin down an exact location of the clump region in the
system. This result, as well as the asymmetric shape of the observed lines,
point at a picture of a complex wind structure.

into a thin shell, sweeps up the circumstellar medium, and eventually enters
the Newtonian phase. The jets naturally develop angular and radial structure
due to hydro-dynamical interaction with surrounding gas. The calculated
synchrotron light curves cover the observed temporal range of prompt to late

exhibit an early emission pulse originating in shock-heated stellar material,

further yields that any effective divisor in $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g}$ with
slope $<6+(12-\delta)/(g+1)$ must contain the locus of curves that are the
normalization of a $\delta$-nodal curve lying on a $K3$ surface of genus
$g+\delta$.

people leave the same area in a short period. Early prediction of dispersal
events is important in mitigating congestion and safety risks and making better
dispatching decisions for taxi and ride-sharing fleets. Existing work mostly
focuses on predicting taxi demand in the near future by learning patterns from
historical data. However, they fail in case of abnormality because dispersal
events with abnormally high demand are non-repetitive and violate common
assumptions such as smoothness in demand change over time. Instead, in this
paper we argue that dispersal events follow a complex pattern of trips and
other related features in the past, which can be used to predict such events.
Therefore, we formulate the dispersal event prediction problem as a survival
analysis problem. We propose a two-stage framework (DILSA), where a deep
learning model combined with survival analysis is developed to predict the
probability of a dispersal event and its demand volume. We conduct extensive
case studies and experiments on the NYC Yellow taxi dataset from 2014-2016.
Results show that DILSA can predict events in the next 5 hours with F1-score of
0.7 and with average time error of 18 minutes. It is orders of magnitude better
than the state-ofthe-art deep learning approaches for taxi demand prediction.

(MISO) broadcast channel (BC) under arbitrary levels of partial channel state
information at the transmitter (CSIT). We show that the parallel subchannels
constituting this setting are separable from a degrees-of-freedom (DoF) region
perspective if and only if the partial CSIT pattern is totally ordered. This
total order condition corresponds to users abiding by the same order, with
respect to their CSIT quality levels, in each of the parallel subchannels. For
instance, let $\alpha_{k}^{[l]}$ and $\alpha_{j}^{[l]}$ be the CSIT quality
parameters for users $k$ and $j$ over subchannel $l$. Under total order, having
$\alpha_{k}^{[l]} \geq \alpha_{j}^{[l]}$ implies that $\alpha_{k}^{[m]} \geq
\alpha_{j}^{[m]}$ holds for every subchannel $m$. In this case, the entire DoF
region is achievable using simple separate coding, where a
single-subchannel-type transmission scheme is employed in each subchannel. To
show this separability result, we first derive an outer bound for the DoF
region by extending the aligned image sets approach of Davoodi and Jafar to the
considered setting. We then show that this outer bound coincides with the inner
bound achieved through separate coding, given by the Minkowski sum of $M$
single-subchannel DoF regions, under the total order condition, hence settling
the if part of the main theorem. To prove the only if part of the theorem, we
identify a set of DoF tuples achievable through joint coding across
subchannels, yet not achievable through separate coding whenever the total
order condition is violated. Moreover, we also highlight the implications of
our main result on the design of CSIT feedback schemes for multi-carrier
multi-antenna wireless networks.

the early step toward the formation of planets inside protoplanetary disks

of solid growth are still poorly understood. In this work, we test the

relative small radius. We have carried out a large family of 1D two-fluid
(gas+dust) hydrodynamical simulations by evolving the gas and dust motion
self-consistently while allowing dust size to evolve via coagulation and
fragmentation. We investigate the joint effects of ringed structures and dust
size growth on the overall sub-millimeter and millimeter (mm) flux and spectral
index of PPDs. Ringed structures slow down the dust radial drift and speed up
the dust growth. In particular, we find that those unresolved disks with a high
fragmentation velocity ($\sim10\ {\rm m~s^{-1}}$) and a high dust surface
density ($\sim10\ {\rm g\ cm^{-2}}$ in the ring) can have mm spectral indices
as low as $\sim2.0$, consistent with mm observations of faint disks in nearby
star forming regions. Furthermore, disks with more than one ringed structure
can potentially reproduce brighter disks with spectral indices lower than
$\sim2.5$. Future multi-wavelength high-resolution observations of these low
spectral index sources can be used to test the existence of the ringed
structures in the unresolved disks and differentiate the effects of dust size
growth from optical depth.

intertwined with non linear activations. In basic models, such as the

embedding of the instance being processed, and produces an output vector
embedding by straight multiplication by a matrix parameter. In more complex
models, the input and output are structured and their embeddings are higher
order tensors. The parameter of each linear operation must then be controlled
so as not to explode with the complexity of the structures involved. This is
essentially the role of convolution models, which exist in many flavours
dependent on the type of structure they deal with (grids, networks, time series
etc.). We present here a unified framework which aims at capturing the essence
of these diverse models, allowing a systematic analysis of their properties and
their mutual enrichment. We also show that attention models naturally fit in
the same framework: attention is convolution in which the structure itself is
adaptive, and learnt, instead of being given a priori.

appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA exchange-correlation functional
significantly over-magnetizes elemental Fe, Co, and Ni solids. For the
paradigmatic case, bcc Fe, the error relative to experiment is $\gtrsim 20 \%$.
Comparative analysis of magnetization results from SCAN and its
\textit{deorbitalized} counterpart, SCAN-L, leads to identification of the
source of the discrepancy. It is not from the difference between Kohn-Sham
(SCAN-L) and generalized Kohn-Sham (SCAN) procedures. The key is the
iso-orbital indicator $\alpha$ (the ratio of the local Pauli and Thomas-Fermi
kinetic energy densities). Its \textit{deorbitalized} counterpart, $\alpha_L$,
has more dispersion in both spin channels with respect to magnetization in an
approximate region between 0.6 Bohr and 1.2 Bohr around an Fe nucleus. The
overall effect is that the SCAN switching function evaluated with $\alpha_L$
reduces the energetic disadvantage of the down channel with respect to up
compared to the original $\alpha$, which in turn reduces the magnetization.
This identifies the cause of the SCAN magnetization error as insensitivity of
the SCAN switching function to $\alpha$ values in the approximate range $0.5
\lesssim \alpha \lesssim 0.8$ and oversensitivity for $\alpha \gtrsim 0.8$.

observables that are important for the next stages of precision cosmology.
First, we note that the theory of reduced angular $N$-point spectra has only
been developed in detail up to the trispectrum case and in a fashion that makes
it difficult to go beyond. To fill this gap, here we present a constructive
approach that provides a systematic description of reduced angular $N$-point
spectra and their covariance matrices, for arbitrary $N$. Second, we focus on
the common practice in the literature on cosmological observables, which
consists in simply discarding a part of the expression, namely, the terms
containing fields evaluated at the observer position. We point out that this is
not justified beyond linear order in perturbation theory, as these terms
contribute to all the multipoles of the corresponding spectra and with a
magnitude that is of the same order as the rest of the non-linear corrections.
We consider the possibility that the reason for neglecting these terms is a
conceptual discomfort when using ensemble averages, which originates in an
apparent tension between the ergodic hypothesis and the privileged position of
the observer on the light-cone. We clarify this subtle issue by performing a
careful derivation of the relation between the theoretical statistical
predictions and the observational estimators for all $N$. We conclude that
there is no inconsistency whatsoever in ensemble-averaging fields at and near
the observer position, thus clearing the way for consistent and robust
high-precision calculations.

adhesion energy overcomes the cost of plasma membrane bending. It is well known
that this leads to a minimal particle size for uptake. Using a simple
deterministic theory for this process, we first show that, for the same radius
and volume, cylindrical particles should be taken up faster than spherical
particles, both for normal and parallel orientations. We then address
stochastic effects, which are expected to be relevant due to small system size,

mean first passage time profits from the multiplicative noise induced by the
spherical geometry. We conclude that stochastic effects are strongly geometry
dependent and may favor spherical shapes during adhesion-driven particle
uptake.

X=Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Y=Pt or W---due to microwave-driven steadily precessing

prefactor in $I^{S_z}$ vs. precession cone angle $\theta$ dependence, as long
as it remains the same, $I^{S_z} \propto \sin^2 \theta$, as in the case where

observed spectral evolution with state is in line with that typically observed
in atoll and stellar mass black hole LMXB. The presence of a relativistic Fe

detect the Fe xxii doublet, whose ratio suggests an electron density of the

due to the Galactic bar, the channelling of this gas into a dense, star-forming
ring/stream at ~ 200 - 300 pc from the Galactic centre, and the launching of
galactic outflows powered by stellar feedback. We find that star formation
activity in the CMZ goes through oscillatory burst/quench cycles, with a period
of tens to hundreds of Myr, characterised by roughly constant gas mass but
order-of-magnitude level variations in the star formation rate. Comparison with
the observed present-day star formation rate of the CMZ suggests that we are
currently near a minimum of this cycle. Stellar feedback drives a mainly
two-phase wind off the Galactic disc. The warm phase dominates the mass flux,
and carries 100 - 200 % of the gas mass converted into stars. However, most of
this gas goes into a fountain and falls back onto the disc rather than escaping
the Galaxy. The hot phase carries most of the energy, with a time-averaged
energy outflow rate of 10 - 20 % of the supernova energy budget.

detectors approaches zero, is of particular interest for describing the
substructure of jets produced at hadron colliders as well as in $e^+e^-$
annihilation. We derive a factorization formula for the leading power
asymptotic behavior in the collinear limit of a generic quantum field theory,
which allows for the resummation of logarithmically enhanced terms to all
orders by renormalization group evolution. The relevant anomalous dimensions
are expressed in terms of the timelike data of the theory, in particular the
moments of the timelike splitting functions, which are known to high
perturbative orders. We relate the small angle and back-to-back limits to each

This relation provides us with the initial conditions for quark and gluon jet
functions at order $\alpha_s^2$. In QCD and in $\mathcal{N}=1$ super-Yang-Mills
theory, we then perform the resummation to next-to-next-to-leading logarithm,
improving previous calculations by two perturbative orders. We highlight the
important role played by the non-vanishing $\beta$ function in these theories,

the EEC in the collinear limit for $e^+e^-$ annihilation, and in
$\mathcal{N}=1$ super-Yang-Mills theory. In conformally invariant
$\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory, reciprocity between timelike and
spacelike evolution can be used to express our factorization formula as a power
law with exponent equal to the spacelike twist-two spin-three anomalous
dimensions, thus providing a connection between timelike and spacelike
approaches.

computation. In this model, any quantum channel can be approximated by applying
a fixed universal quantum operation onto an input state and a quantum `program'
state, whose role is to condition the operation performed by the processor. It
is known that perfect channel simulation is only possible in the limit of
infinitely large program states, so that finding the best program state
represents an open problem in the presence of realistic finite-dimensional
resources. Here we prove that the search for the optimal quantum program is a
convex optimization problem. This can be solved either exactly, by minimizing a
diamond distance cost function via semi-definite programming, or approximately,
by minimizing other cost functions via gradient-based machine learning methods.
We apply this general result to a number of different designs for the
programmable quantum processor, from the shallow protocol of quantum
teleportation, to deeper schemes relying on port-based teleportation and
parametric quantum circuits. We benchmark the various designs by investigating
their optimal performance in simulating arbitrary unitaries, Pauli and
amplitude damping channels.

certain product (or adopt a technology) or not. The product is either good or
bad, but its true value is unknown to the players. Instead, each player has her
own private information on its quality. Each player can observe the previous
actions of other players and estimate the quality of the product. A classic
result in the literature shows that in similar settings informational cascades
occur where learning stops for the whole network and players repeat the actions
of their predecessors. In contrast to this literature, in this work, players
get more than one opportunity to act. In each turn, a player is chosen
uniformly at random from all players and can decide to buy the product and
leave the market or wait. Her utility is the total expected discounted reward,
and thus myopic strategies may not constitute equilibria. We provide a
characterization of perfect Bayesian equilibria (PBE) with forward-looking
strategies through a fixed-point equation of dimensionality that grows only
quadratically with the number of players. Using this tractable fixed-point
equation, we show the existence of a PBE and characterize PBE with threshold

sustained small amplitude oscillations corresponds to a Hopf bifurcation. For
systems involving impacts, thresholds, switches, or other abrupt events,
however, this transition can be achieved in fundamentally different ways. This
paper reviews 20 such `Hopf-like' bifurcations for two-dimensional ODE systems
with state-dependent switching rules. The bifurcations include boundary
equilibrium bifurcations, the collision or change of stability of equilibria or
folds on switching manifolds, and limit cycle creation via hysteresis or time
delay. In each case a stationary solution changes stability and possibly form,
and emits one limit cycle. Each bifurcation is analysed quantitatively in a
general setting: we identify quantities that govern the onset, criticality, and
genericity of the bifurcation, and determine scaling laws for the period and
amplitude of the resulting limit cycle. Complete derivations based on
asymptotic expansions of Poincare maps are provided. Many of these are new,
done previously only for piecewise-linear systems. The bifurcations are
collated and compared so that dynamical observations can be matched to
geometric mechanisms responsible for the creation of a limit cycle. The results
are illustrated with impact oscillators, relay control, automated balancing
control, predator-prey systems, ocean circulation, and the McKean and
Wilson-Cowan neuron models.

iteratively optimizes morphology configurations (based on the performance of

learns the corresponding controllers (exploiting the knowledge collected from
optimizing for previous morphologies). Moreover, HPC-BBO can select a ""batch""

HPC-BBO on the design of the morphology and controller for a simulated 6-legged

networks of excitable elements in response to noise: while at low noise,
solutions remain in the vicinity of the resting state and large-noise solutions
show asynchronous activity, the network displays orderly, perfectly
synchronized periodic responses at intermediate level of noise. We show that
this phenomenon is fundamentally stochastic and collective in nature. Indeed,
for noise and coupling within specific ranges, an asymmetry in the transition
rates between a resting and an excited regime progressively builds up, leading
to an increase in the fraction of excited neurons eventually triggering a chain
reaction associated with a macroscopic synchronized excursion and a collective
return to rest where this process starts afresh, thus yielding the observed
periodic synchronized oscillations. We further uncover a novel anti-resonance
phenomenon: noise-induced synchronized oscillations disappear when the system
is driven by periodic stimulation with frequency within a specific range. In
that anti-resonance regime, the system is optimal for measures of information
capacity. This observation provides a new hypothesis accounting for the
efficiency of Deep Brain Stimulation therapies in Parkinson's disease, a
neurodegenerative disease characterized by an increased synchronization of
brain motor circuits. We further discuss the universality of these phenomena in
the class of stochastic networks of excitable elements with confining coupling,
and illustrate this universality by analyzing various classical models of
neuronal networks. Altogether, these results uncover some universal mechanisms
supporting a regularizing impact of noise in excitable systems, reveal a novel
anti-resonance phenomenon in these systems, and propose a new hypothesis for

attains an overall accuracy (mean absolute surface distance) of 1.40+-0.26 mm,

all the running and proposed accelerator oscillation experiments. Degeneracy of
the zeroth order eigensystem around solar and atmospheric resonances are
resolved. Corrections to the zeroth order results are restricted to no larger

continuous functions of matter potential, the zeroth order precision is much
better than $\Delta m^2_\odot/\Delta m^2_\text{atm}$ for weak matter effect.

what finite groups appear as the Galois group of an extension of the rational
numbers in which only a predetermined set of primes may ramify. After
presenting new results regarding extensions in which only a single finite prime
ramifies, we move on to studying the more complex situation in which multiple
primes from a finite set of arbitrary size may ramify. We then continue by
examining a conjecture of Harbater that the minimal number of generators of the
Galois group of a tame, Galois extension of the rational numbers is bounded
above by the sum of a constant and the logarithm of the product of the ramified
primes. We prove the validity of Harbater's conjecture in a number of cases,
including the situation where we restrict our attention to finite groups
containing a nilpotent subgroup of index $1,2,$ or $3$. We also derive some
consequences that are implied by the truth of this conjecture.

kinematic, spatial, and, potentially, age distributions characterize the
metal-poor and metal-rich components. Despite this observed dichotomy, which
argues for different formation channels for those stars, the distribution of
bulge stars in the $\alpha$-abundance versus metallicity plane has been found
so far to be a rather smooth single sequence. We use data from the fourteenth
data release of the APOGEE spectroscopic survey (DR14) to investigate the
distribution in the Mg abundance (as tracer of the
$\alpha$-elements)-versus-metallicity plane of a sample of stars selected to be
in the inner region of the bulge. A clean sample has been selected from the
DR14 using a set of data- and pipeline-flags to ensure the quality of their
fundamental parameters and elemental abundances. An additional selection made
use of computed spectro-photometric distances to select a sample of likely
bulge stars as those with ${\rm R_{GC}\leq 3.5~kpc}$. We adopt magnesium
abundance as an $\alpha$-abundance proxy for our clean sample as it has been
proven to be the most accurate $\alpha$-element as determined by ASPCAP, the
pipeline for data products from APOGEE spectra. From the distribution of our
bulge sample in the [Mg/Fe]-versus-[Fe/H] plane, we found that the sequence is
bimodal. This bimodality is given by the presence of a low-Mg sequence of stars
parallel to the main high-Mg sequence over a range of $\sim 0.5$~dex around
solar metallicity. The two sequences merge above ${\rm [Fe/H]\sim0.15~ dex}$
into a single sequence whose dispersion in [Mg/Fe] is larger than either of the
two sequences visible at lower metallicity. This result is confirmed when we
consider stars in our sample that are inside the bulge region according to
trustworthy Gaia DR2 distances.

solution, the adaptive time-stepper produces solutions that ""nearly"" converge

pairing interaction, monotonically weakens with increasing doping and
completely disappears precisely where superconductivity disappears. This is the
direct evidence that in the overdoped regime, superconductivity is determined

description. The goal of this paper is to build such a description, with the
purpose to permit an efficient comparison independent of any specific prior or

statistical description of non-Gaussian processes, developed in data science,
that encodes long-range interactions through a hierarchical multiscale approach
based on the Wavelet transform. We perform a reduction of the WST through a fit
of its angular dependencies, allowing to gather most of the information it
contains into a few components whose physical meanings are identified, and that
describe, e.g., isotropic and anisotropic behaviours. The result of this paper
is the Reduced Wavelet Scattering Transform (RWST), a statistical description
with a small number of coefficients that characterizes complex structures
arising from non-linear phenomena, free from any specific prior. The RWST
coefficients encode moments of order up to four, have reduced variances, and
quantify the couplings between scales. To show the efficiency and generality of
this description, we apply it successfully to three kinds of processes:
fractional Brownian motions, MHD simulations, and Herschel observations in a
molecular cloud. With fewer than 100 coefficients when probing 6 scales and 8
angles on 256*256 maps, we were able with the RWST to perform quantitative
comparisons, to infer relevant physical properties, and to produce realistic

of (full) memory obliviousness, which was introduced by Goldreich and Ostrovsky
[J. ACM '96] and extensively researched by cryptographers. The new notion,
differential obliviousness, requires that any two neighboring inputs exhibit
similar memory access patterns, where the similarity requirement is that of
differential privacy. Chan et al. demonstrated that differential obliviousness
allows achieving improved efficiency for several algorithmic tasks, including
sorting, merging of sorted lists, and range query data structures.
  In this work, we continue the exploration and mapping of differential
obliviousness, focusing on algorithms that do not necessarily examine all their
input. This choice is motivated by the fact that the existence of logarithmic
overhead ORAM protocols implies that differential obliviousness can yield at
most a logarithmic improvement in efficiency for computations that need to
examine all their input. In particular, we explore property testing, where we
show that differential obliviousness yields an almost linear improvement in
overhead in the dense graph model, and at most quadratic improvement in the
bounded degree model. We also explore tasks where a non-oblivious algorithm
would need to explore different portions of the input, where the latter would
depend on the input itself, and where we show that such a behavior can be
maintained under differential obliviousness, but not under full obliviousness.
Our examples suggest that there would be benefits in further exploring which
class of computational tasks are amenable to differential obliviousness.

problem that would benefit from the development of automated algorithms. EEGs

series where the placement of leads on a patient's scalp provides prior
information about the structure of interactions. Commonly used deep learning
models for time series don't offer a way to leverage structural information,
but this would be desirable in a model for structural time series. To address
this challenge, we propose the temporal graph convolutional network (TGCN), a
model that leverages structural information and has relatively few parameters.
TGCNs apply feature extraction operations that are localized and shared over
both time and space, thereby providing a useful inductive bias in tasks where
one expects similar features to be discriminative across the different
sequences. In our experiments we focus on metrics that are most important to
seizure detection, and demonstrate that TGCN matches the performance of related

Additionally, we investigate interpretability advantages of TGCN by exploring
approaches for helping clinicians determine when precisely seizures occur, and

summarize the observed data in each cluster and intercluster communications are
assumed to be inexpensive. The CHs with more informative observations transmit
their data to the fusion center (FC) first. By halting before all transmissions
have taken place, transmissions can be saved without performance loss. It is
shown that this ordering approach can guarantee a lower bound on the average

local electron-phonon interaction in the quantum spin Hall topological
insulator described by the half-filled Kane-Mele model on an honeycomb lattice.
Starting from the topological non trivial phase, where the minimal gap is
located at the two inequivalent Dirac points of the Graphene, $\text{K}$ and
$\text{K}'$, we show that the coupling with quantum phonons induces a
topological-trivial quantum phase transition through a gap closing and
reopening in the $\text{M}$ point of the Brillouin zone. The average number of
fermions in this point turns out to be a direct indicator of the quantum
transition pointing out a strong hybridization between the two bare
quasiparticle bands of the Kane-Mele model. By increasing the strength of
charge-lattice coupling, the phonon Green's propagator displays a two peak
structure: the one located at the lowest energy exhibits a softening that is
maximum around the topological transition. Numerical simulations provide also
evidence of several kinks in the quasiparticle dispersion caused by the
coupling of the electrons with the bosonic lattice mode.

including web and eCommerce search, suggesting full queries based on a prefix
typed by the user. QAC has been extensively studied in the literature in the
recent years, and it has been consistently shown that adding personalization
features can significantly improve the performance of QAC. In this work we
propose a novel method for personalized QAC that uses lightweight embeddings
learnt through fastText. We construct an embedding for the user context
queries, which are the last few queries issued by the user. We also use the
same model to get the embedding for the candidate queries to be ranked. We
introduce ranking features that compute the distance between the candidate
queries and the context queries in the embedding space. These features are then
combined with other commonly used QAC ranking features to learn a ranking
model. We apply our method to a large eCommerce search engine (eBay) and show
that the ranker with our proposed feature significantly outperforms the
baselines on all of the offline metrics measured, which includes Mean
Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Success Rate (SR), Mean Average Precision (MAP), and
Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). Our baselines include the Most
Popular Completion (MPC) model as well as a ranking model without our proposed
features. The ranking model with the proposed features results in a $20-30\%$
improvement over the MPC model on all metrics. We obtain up to a $5\%$
improvement over the baseline ranking model for all the sessions, which goes up
to about $10\%$ when we restrict to sessions that contain the user context.
Moreover, our proposed features also significantly outperform text based
personalization features studied in the literature before, and adding text
based features on top of our proposed embedding based features results only in
minor improvements.

implemented through a simple phase factor multiplication on the training data,
each DNN in the series will be trained to approximate the target function's

DNN achieves the speed of convergence as in the low frequency range. As a
result, the proposed PhaseDNN system is able to convert wideband frequency

  We define and test a new technique to accurately measure the cavity defects
of air-spaced FPIs, including distortions due to the spectral tuning process
typical of astronomical observations. We further develop a correction technique
to maintain the shape of the cavity as constant as possible during the spectral
scan. These are necessary steps to optimize the spectral transmission profile
of a two-dimensional spectrograph using one or more FPIs.
  We devise a generalization of the techniques developed for the so-called
phase-shifting interferometry to the case of FPIs. The technique is applicable
to any FPI that can be tuned via changing the cavity spacing ($z$-axis), and
can be used for any etalon regardless of the coating' reflectivity. The major
strength of our method is the ability to fully characterize the cavity during a
spectral scan, allowing for the determination of scan-dependent modifications
of the plates. As a test, we have applied this technique to three 50 mm
diameter interferometers, with cavity gaps ranging between 600 micron and 3 mm,
coated for use in the visible range.
  We obtain accurate and reliable measures of the cavity defects of air-spaced
FPIs, and of their evolution during the entire spectral scan. Our main, and
unexpected, result is that the relative tilt between the two FPI plates varies
significantly during the spectral scan, and can dominate the cavity defects; in
particular, we observe that the tilt component at the extremes of the scan is
sensibly larger than at the center of the scan. Exploiting the capability of
the electronic controllers to set the reference plane at any given spectral
step, we develop a correction technique that allows the minimization of the
tilt during a complete spectral scan. The correction remains highly stable over
long periods, well beyond the typical duration of astronomical observations.

generated as quantum fluctuations in the early Universe, but then undergo a
quantum-to-classical transition. A key role in this transition is played by
squeezing of the quantum state, which is a result of the strong suppression of
the decaying mode component of the perturbations. Motivated by ever improving
measurements of the cosmological perturbations, we ask whether there are
scenarios where this decaying mode is nevertheless still observable in the late
Universe, ideally leading to a ``smoking gun'' signature of the quantum nature
of the perturbations. We address this question by evolving the quantum state of
the perturbations from inflation into the post-inflationary Universe. After
recovering the standard result that in slow-roll (SR) inflation the decaying
mode is indeed hopelessly suppressed by the time the perturbations are observed
(by $\sim 115$ orders of magnitude), we turn to ultra slow-roll (USR)
inflation, a scenario in which the usual decaying mode actually grows on
super-horizon scales. Despite this drastic difference in the behavior of the
mode functions, we find also in USR that the late-Universe decaying mode
amplitude is dramatically suppressed, in fact by the same $\sim 115$ orders of
magnitude. We finally explain that this large suppression is a general result
that holds beyond the SR and USR scenarios considered and follows from a
modified version of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and the observed
amplitude of the primordial power spectrum. The classical behavior of the
perturbations is thus closely related to the classical behavior of macroscopic
objects drawing an analogy with the position of a massive particle, the
curvature perturbations today have an enormous effective mass of order $m_{\rm
pl}^2/H_0^2 \sim 10^{120}$, making them highly classical.

resonance (ESR/EPR) line width as a function of inverse temperature, we studied
the motional narrowing effect by considering a combined model of carrier
transitions and static dispersion of the angular frequency giving rise to an
inhomogeneous broadening in the spectrum. The dispersion of the angular
frequency results from the distribution of the local field. The transition
between the sites under inhomogeneous static local field induces adiabatic
relaxation of the spin. We also considered the on-site inherent (nonadiabatic)
relaxation of the spin. We obtained the exact solution of the spin correlation
function by explicitly considering transitions between two sites for both
Markovian and non-Markovian transition processes. The absorption line shape is
expressed in terms of the Voigt function, which is a convolution of a Gaussian
function and a Lorentzian function. Using the known properties of the Voigt
function, we discuss the correlation between the change in the full-width at
half-maximum and the change in line shape, both of which are induced by
motional narrowing. By assuming thermal activation processes for both the
hopping transition and the on-site inherent relaxation, we show that the
minimum of the width appears as a function of inverse temperature as observed
experimentally in organic materials.Contrary to the general belief, we also
show that the narrowing of the Gaussian line shape under a local random field
did not necessarily lead to a Lorentzian line shape in particular under the
presence of heavy tail property in the waiting time distribution of hopping

rules that choose a winning candidate from a set of candidates based on voter
preferences. Voters and candidates are located in an underlying metric space. A
voter has cost equal to her distance to the winning candidate. Ordinal social
choice rules only have access to the ordinal preferences of the voters that are
assumed to be consistent with the metric distances. Our goal is to design an
ordinal social choice rule with minimum distortion, which is the worst-case
ratio, over all consistent metrics, between the social cost of the rule and
that of the optimal omniscient rule with knowledge of the underlying metric
space.
  The distortion of the best deterministic social choice rule was known to be
between $3$ and $5$. It had been conjectured that any rule that only looks at
the weighted tournament graph on the candidates cannot have distortion better
than $5$. In our paper, we disprove it by presenting a weighted tournament rule
with distortion of $4.236$. We design this rule by generalizing the classic
notion of uncovered sets, and further show that this class of rules cannot have
distortion better than $4.236$. We then propose a new voting rule, via an
alternative generalization of uncovered sets. We show that if a candidate
satisfying the criterion of this voting rule exists, then choosing such a
candidate yields a distortion bound of $3$, matching the lower bound. We
present a combinatorial conjecture that implies distortion of $3$, and verify
it for small numbers of candidates and voters by computer experiments. Using
our framework, we also show that selecting any candidate guarantees distortion
of at most $3$ when the weighted tournament graph is cyclically symmetric.

reliability. To provide low latency data access, replicas are often required to
accept updates without coordination with each other, and the updates are then
propagated asynchronously. This brings the critical challenge of conflict
resolution among concurrent updates. Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT)
is a principled approach to addressing this challenge. However, existing CRDT
designs are tricky, and hard to be generalized to other data types. A design
framework is in great need to guide the systematic design of new CRDTs.
  To address this challenge, we propose RWF -- the Remove-Win design Framework
for CRDTs. RWF leverages the simple but powerful remove-win strategy to resolve
conflicting updates, and provides generic design for a variety of data
container types. Two exemplar implementations following RWF are given over the
Redis data type store, which demonstrate the effectiveness of RWF. Performance
measurements of our implementations further show the efficiency of CRDT designs

establish if the advancement of Driller stems from the concolic execution or

designed FEData, a prototype corpus that currently focuses on four

in addition indirectly via its radio emission in the atmosphere. The
electromagnetic particles do not reach the ground for very inclined showers. On
the contrary, the atmosphere is transparent for the radio emission and its
footprint on ground increases with the zenith angle. Therefore, the radio
technique offers a reliable detection over the full range of zenith angles, and
in particular for inclined showers. In this work, the mass sensitivity of a
combination of the radio emission with the muons is investigated in a case
study for the site of the Pierre Auger Observatory using CORSIKA Monte Carlo
simulations of showers in the EeV energy range. It is shown, that the
radio-muon combination features superior mass separation power in particular
for inclined showers, when compared to established mass observables such as a
combination of muons and electrons or the shower maximum Xmax. Accurate
measurements of the energy-dependent mass composition of ultra-high energy
cosmic rays are essential to understand their still unknown origin. Thus, the
combination of muon and radio detectors can enhance the scientific performance
of future air-shower arrays and offers a promising upgrade option for existing

promise in reducing their compute and storage cost. Albeit alluring, without
special techniques for training and optimization, deep quantization results in
significant accuracy loss. To further mitigate this loss, we propose a novel
sinusoidal regularization, called SinReQ1, for deep quantized training. SinReQ
adds a periodic term to the original objective function of the underlying
training algorithm. SinReQ exploits the periodicity, differentiability, and the
desired convexity profile in sinusoidal functions to automatically propel
weights towards values that are inherently closer to quantization levels.
Since, this technique does not require invasive changes to the training
procedure, SinReQ can harmoniously enhance quantized training algorithms.
SinReQ offers generality and flexibility as it is not limited to a certain
bitwidth or a uniform assignment of bitwidths across layers. We carry out
experimentation using the AlexNet, CIFAR-10, ResNet-18, ResNet-20, SVHN, and
VGG-11 DNNs with three to five bits for quantization and show the versatility
of SinReQ in enhancing multiple quantized training algorithms, DoReFa [32] and

evaluate effects of temperature and phase boundaries on local and average
structures. Analyses of unit cell parameters showed that both materials exhibit
very similar thermal expansion behavior and thermal expansion data lay along
the upper bound of uncertainty for standard empirical models, indicating a
slightly faster thermal expansion rate. Atomic displacement parameters of
UO$_{2.07}$ showed evidence for U$_{4}$O$_{9}$ phase boundaries in accordance
with the established phase diagram, despite the suppression of U$_{4}$O$_{9}$
superlattice peaks in the measured diffraction patterns. Pair distribution
functions revealed that the differences in local structure between UO$_{2}$ and
UO$_{2.07}$ were very small and PDF features are dominated by thermal effects.
The rate of contraction of the first nearest-neighbor U-O distances of UO$_{2}$

trademark of three-dimensional topological insulators (3DTIs). Exploiting
surface-mobility indicates successful application of topological properties for
practical purposes. However, the detection of the surface-mobility has been
hindered by the inevitable bulk conduction. Even in the case of high-quality
crystals, the bulk state forms the dominant channel of the electrical current.
Therefore, with electrical transport measurement, the surface-mobility can be
resolved only below-micrometer-thick crystals. The evaluation of the
surface-mobility becomes more challenging at higher temperatures, where phonons
can play a role. Here, using spectroscopic techniques, we successfully
evaluated the surface-mobility of Bi2Te3 (BT) at room temperature (RT). We
acquired the effective masses and mean scattering times for both the surface
and bulk states using angle-resolved photoemission and terahertz time-domain
spectroscopy. We revealed a record-high surface-mobility for BT, exceeding
33,000 cm^2/(Vs) per surface sheet, despite intrinsic limitations by the
coexisting bulk state as well as phonons at RT. Our findings partially support
the interesting conclusion that the topological protection persists at RT. Our
approach could be applicable to other topological materials possessing
multiband structures near the Fermi level.

aim to disrupt cooperative spectrum sensing by sending falsified versions of
spectrum sensing data to a fusion center. However, existing studies usually
assume network or attackers as passive entities, e.g., assuming the prior
knowledge of attacks is known or fixed. In practice, attackers can actively
adopt arbitrary behaviors and avoid pre-assumed patterns or assumptions used by
defense strategies. In this paper, we revisit this security vulnerability as an
adversarial machine learning problem and propose a novel learning-empowered
attack framework named Learning-Evaluation-Beating (LEB) to mislead the fusion
center. Based on the black-box nature of the fusion center in cooperative
spectrum sensing, our new perspective is to make the adversarial use of machine
learning to construct a surrogate model of the fusion center's decision model.
We propose a generic algorithm to create malicious sensing data using this
surrogate model. Our real-world experiments show that the LEB attack is
effective to beat a wide range of existing defense strategies with an up to 82%
of success ratio. Given the gap between the proposed LEB attack and existing
defenses, we introduce a non-invasive method named as influence-limiting
defense, which can coexist with existing defenses to defend against LEB attack
or other similar attacks. We show that this defense is highly effective and
reduces the overall disruption ratio of LEB attack by up to 80%.

the selfish strategies of each individual device can influence the global

energy that flows through two calorimeters separated by some relative angle in
the final state created by a source. We study this observable in the limit of
small and large angles when it describes the correlation between particles
belonging, respectively, to the same jet and to two almost back-to-back jets.
We present a new approach to resumming large logarithmically enhanced
corrections in both limits that exploits the relation between the energy
correlations and four-point correlation functions of conserved currents. At
large angle, we derive the EEC from the behaviour of the correlation function
in the limit when four operators are light-like separated in a sequential
manner. At small angle, in a conformal theory, we obtain the EEC from
resummation of the conformal partial wave expansion of the correlation function
at short-distance separation between the calorimeters. In both cases, we obtain
a concise representation of the EEC in terms of the conformal data of twist-two
operators and verify it by comparing with the results of explicit calculation
at next-to-next-to-leading order in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
As a byproduct of our analysis, we predict the maximal weight part of the
analogous QCD expression in the back-to-back limit.

changing energy constant ($E$) of the flow. We used the ADAF solutions and
investigated a general power index rule of a radial bulk velocity $(\vr\propto
r^{-p})$ with different BLs, but the power index with radius for a rotation
velocity and sound speed is unchanged. Here, $p\geq0.5$ is a power index. This
power rule gives two types of self-similar solutions; first, when $p=0.5$ gives
a self-similar solution of a first kind and exists for infinite length, which
has already been discovered for the ADAFs by Narayan \& Yi, and second, when
$p>0.5$ gives a self-similar solution of a second kind and exists for finite
length, which corresponds to our new solutions for the ADAFs. By using this
index rule in fluid equations, we found that the Mach number ($M$) and
advection factor ($\fadv$) vary with the radius when $p>0.5$. The local
energies of the ADAFs and the Keplerian disk are matched very well at the BLs.
So, this theoretical study is supporting a two-zone configuration theory of the
accretion disk, and we also discussed other possible hybrid disk geometries.
The present study can have two main implications with a variation of the $p$;
first, one that can help with the understanding of outflows and non-thermal
spectrum variations in black hole candidates, and second, one that can help
with solving partial differential equations for any sized advective disk.

change, and hence can not be patched for bugs once deployed. Thus it is
critical to ensure they are bug-free and well-designed before deployment. A
Contract defect is an error, flaw or fault in a smart contract that causes it
to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.
The detection of contract defects is a method to avoid potential bugs and
improve the design of existing code. Since smart contracts contain numerous
distinctive features, such as the gas system. decentralized, it is important to
find smart contract specified defects. To fill this gap, we collected
smart-contract-related posts from Ethereum StackExchange, as well as real-world
smart contracts. We manually analyzed these posts and contracts; using them to
define 20 kinds of contract defects. We categorized them into indicating
potential security, availability, performance, maintainability and reusability
problems. To validate if practitioners consider these contract as harmful, we
created an online survey and received 138 responses from 32 different

would improve the quality and robustness of smart contracts. We manually
identified our defined contract defects in 587 real world smart contract and

search for adaptive solutions in time-varying fitness landscapes. Generalists
correspond to genotypes that remain fit across diverse selective pressures;
cross-reactive antibodies are much wanted but rare, while multi-drug resistant
microbes are undesired yet prevalent. However, little is known about under what
conditions such solutions with a high capacity to adapt would be efficiently
discovered by evolution, as environmental changes alter the relative fitness
and accessibility of neighboring genotypes. In addition, can epistasis --- the
source of landscape ruggedness and path constraints --- play a different role,
if the environments are correlated in time? We present a generative model to
estimate the propensity of evolving generalists in rugged landscapes that are
tunably related and cycling relatively slowly. We find that environment cycling
can substantially facilitate the search for fit generalists by dynamically
enlarging their effective basins of attraction. Importantly, these high
performers are most likely to emerge at an intermediate level of both
ruggedness and environmental relatedness, trading diversity for fitness and
accessibility. Our work provides a conceptual framework to study evolution in
correlated varying complex environments, and offers statistical understanding
that suggests general strategies for speeding up the generation of broadly
neutralizing antibodies or preventing microbes from evolving multi-drug

apply the stochastic quantization to engineering problems, we propose a novel
method to incorporate a potential term into stochastic quantization of the

rise to the potential term for the discrete-time path integral and preserves
the role of the path integral as the probability distribution, without making
any assumptions on the drift term. A second order approximation on the
stochastic fluctuations for the path integral gives difference equations which
represent the time evolution of expectation value and covariance matrix for the
stochastic processes. The difference equations explicitly derive Extended
Kalman Filter and models on the constrained Ito processes by the identification
of the potential function with a penalty or barrier function. The numerical
simulations of the constrained stochastic systems show that the potential term
can constrain the nonlinear dynamics towards a minimum or a decreasing

of light wave in an underwater channel in terms of the inherent optical
properties related to the environments, namely the absorption and scattering
coefficients as well as the phase scattering function (PSF). The proposed
numerical algorithm was improved based on the ones proposed in [1]-[4], by
modifying the finite difference scheme proposed in [1] as well as an
enhancement of the quadrature method proposed in [2] by involving a more
accurate 7-points quadrature scheme in order to calculate the quadrature weight
coefficients corresponding to the integral term of the RTE. Furthermore, the
scattering angular discretization algorithm used in [3] and [4] was modified,
based on which the receiver's field of view discretization was adapted
correspondingly. Interestingly, the RTE solver has been applied to three volume
scattering functions, namely: the single-term HG phase function, the two-term
HG phase function [5], and the Fournier-Forand phase function [6], over
Harbor-I and Harbor-II water types. Based on the normalized received power
evaluated through the proposed algorithm, the bit error rate performance of the
UOWC system is investigated in terms of system and channel parameters. The
enhanced algorithm gives a tightly close performance to its Monte Carlo
counterpart improved based on the simulations provided in [7], by adjusting the
numerical cumulative distribution function computation method as well as
optimizing the number of scattering angles. Matlab codes for the proposed RTE

(mmWave) wireless systems has been recently proposed to provide high data rate
aerial links for next generation wireless networks. However, establishing
UAV-based mmWave links is quite challenging due to the random fluctuations of
hovering UAVs which can induce antenna gain mismatch between transmitter and
receiver. To assess the benefit of UAV-based mmWave links, in this paper,
tractable, closed-form statistical channel models are derived for three UAV
communication scenarios: (i) a direct UAV-to-UAV link, (ii) an aerial relay
link in which source, relay, and destination are hovering UAVs, and (iii) a
relay link in which a hovering UAV connects a ground source to a ground
destination. The accuracy of the derived analytical expressions is corroborated
by performing Monte-Carlo simulations. Numerical results are then used to study
the effect of antenna directivity gain under different channel conditions for
establishing reliable UAV-based mmWave links in terms of achieving minimum
outage probability. It is shown that the performance of such links is largely
dependent on the random fluctuations of hovering UAVs. Moreover, higher antenna
directivity gains achieve better performance at low SNR regime. Nevertheless,
at the high SNR regime, lower antenna directivity gains result in a more
reliable communication link. The developed results can therefore be applied as
a benchmark for finding the optimal antenna directivity gain of UAVs under the
different levels of instability without resorting to time-consuming
simulations.

has been to model the stochastic error signals of individual sensors
independently, whether as components of a single inertial measurement unit
(IMU) in different directions or arrayed in the same direction for redundancy.
These signals usually have an extremely complex spectral structure that is
often described using latent (or composite) models composed by a sum of
underlying models. A large amount of research in this domain has been focused
on the latter aspect through the proposal of various methods that have been
able to improve the estimation of these models both from a computational and a
statistical point of view. However, the separate calibration of the individual
sensors is still unable to take into account the dependence between each of
them which can have an important impact on the precision of the navigation
systems. In this paper, we develop a new approach to simultaneously model both
the individual signals and the dependence between them by studying the quantity
called Wavelet Cross-Covariance and using it to extend the application of the
Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments. This new method can be used in other
settings for time series modeling, especially in cases where the dependence
among signals may be hard to detect. Moreover, in the field of inertial sensor
calibration, this approach can deliver important contributions among which the
possibility to test dependence between sensors, integrate their dependence
within the navigation filter and construct an optimal virtual sensor that can
be used to simplify and improve navigation accuracy. The advantages of this
method and its usefulness for inertial sensor calibration are highlighted

  Hypergraphs","31 pages",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A sparsifier of a graph $G$ (Bencz\'ur and Karger; Spielman and Teng) is a
sparse weighted subgraph $\tilde G$ that approximately retains the cut
structure of $G$. For general graphs, non-trivial sparsification is possible
only by using weighted graphs in which different edges have different weights.
Even for graphs that admit unweighted sparsifiers, there are no known
polynomial time algorithms that find such unweighted sparsifiers.
  We study a weaker notion of sparsification suggested by Oveis Gharan, in
which the number of edges in each cut $(S,\bar S)$ is not approximated within a
multiplicative factor $(1+\epsilon)$, but is, instead, approximated up to an
additive term bounded by $\epsilon$ times $d\cdot |S| + \text{vol}(S)$, where
$d$ is the average degree, and $\text{vol}(S)$ is the sum of the degrees of the
vertices in $S$. We provide a probabilistic polynomial time construction of
such sparsifiers for every graph, and our sparsifiers have a near-optimal
number of edges $O(\epsilon^{-2} n {\rm polylog}(1/\epsilon))$. We also provide
a deterministic polynomial time construction that constructs sparsifiers with a
weaker property having the optimal number of edges $O(\epsilon^{-2} n)$. Our
constructions also satisfy a spectral version of the ``additive
sparsification'' property.
  Our construction of ``additive sparsifiers'' with $O_\epsilon (n)$ edges also
works for hypergraphs, and provides the first non-trivial notion of
sparsification for hypergraphs achievable with $O(n)$ hyperedges when
$\epsilon$ and the rank $r$ of the hyperedges are constant. Finally, we provide
a new construction of spectral hypergraph sparsifiers, according to the
standard definition, with ${\rm poly}(\epsilon^{-1},r)\cdot n\log n$
hyperedges, improving over the previous spectral construction (Soma and
Yoshida) that used $\tilde O(n^3)$ hyperedges even for constant $r$ and
$\epsilon$.

chunks and one of their main characteristics besides the computational benefit

derive global learning rates for localized SVMs with Gaussian kernels and hinge
loss. Under certain assumptions our rates outperform known classification rates
for localized SVMs, for global SVMs, and other learning algorithms based on
e.g., plug-in rules, trees, or DNNs. These rates are achieved under a set of
margin conditions that describe the behavior of the data-generating
distribution, where no assumption on the existence of a density is made. We
observe that a margin condition that relates the distance to the decision
boundary to the amount of noise is crucial to obtain rates. The statistical
analysis relies on a careful analysis of the excess risk which includes a
separation of the input space into a subset that is close to the decision
boundary and into a subset that is sufficiently far away. Moreover, we show
that our rates are obtained adaptively, that is, without knowing the parameters

  Network for Astronomy & astrophysics (BINA) workshop, 9-12 October, 2018",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are high luminosity sources powered by accretion
of matter onto SMBHs located at the centres of galaxies. The SMBH is surrounded
by a broad emission line region (BLR) and a dusty torus. It is difficult to
study the extent of the dusty torus as the central region of AGN is not
resolvable using any conventional imaging techniques available today. Though,
current IR interferometric techniques could in principle resolve the torus in
nearby AGN, it is very expensive and limited to few bright and nearby AGN. A
more feasible alternative to the interferometric technique to find the extent
of the dusty torus in AGN is the technique of reverberation mapping (RM). REMAP
(REverberation Mapping of AGN Program) is a long term photometric monitoring
program being carried out using the 2 m HCT operated by the IIA, Bangalore,
aimed at measuring the torus size in many AGN using the technique of RM. It
involves accumulation of suitably long and well sampled light curves in the
optical and near-infrared bands to measure the time delays between the light
curves in different wavebands. These delays are used to determine the radius of
the inner edge of the dust torus. REMAP was initiated in the year 2016 and
since then about one hour of observing time once every five days (weather
permitting) has been allocated at the HCT. Our initial sample carefully
selected for this program consists of a total of 8 sources observable using the
HCT. REMAP has resulted in the determination of the extent of the inner edge of
the dusty torus in one AGN namely H0507+164. Data accumulation for the second
source is completed and observations on the third source are going on. We will
outline the motivation of this observational program, the observational
strategy that is followed, the analysis procedures adopted for this work and
the results obtained from this program till now.

a way which mimics sampling randomly from the Haar measure on the unitary
group, with applications across quantum information processing and physics. We
construct new families of quantum circuits on $n$-qubits giving rise to
$\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $t$-designs efficiently in $O(n^3t^{12})$
depth. These quantum circuits are based on a relaxation of technical
requirements in previous constructions. In particular, the construction of
circuits which give efficient approximate $t$-designs by Brandao, Harrow, and
Horodecki (F.G.S.L Brandao, A.W Harrow, and M. Horodecki, Commun. Math. Phys.
(2016).) required choosing gates from ensembles which contained inverses for
all elements, and that the entries of the unitaries are algebraic. We reduce
these requirements, to sets that contain elements without inverses in the set,
and non-algebraic entries, which we dub partially invertible universal sets. We
then adapt this circuit construction to the framework of measurement based
quantum computation(MBQC) and give new explicit examples of $n$-qubit graph
states with fixed assignments of measurements (graph gadgets) giving rise to
unitary $t$-designs based on partially invertible universal sets, in a natural
way. We further show that these graph gadgets demonstrate a quantum speedup, up
to standard complexity theoretic conjectures. We provide numerical and
analytical evidence that almost any assignment of fixed measurement angles on
an $n$-qubit cluster state give efficient $t$-designs and demonstrate a quantum
speedup.

When $R$ is analytically irreducible, and $\mathcal I(1),\ldots,\mathcal I(r)$

to hold for filtrations, but the good conclusions that hold in the case of

  In this article, we consider multiplicities and mixed multiplicities of $R$
by $m_R$-primary divisorial filtrations. We show that some important theorems
on equalities of multiplicities and mixed multiplicities of $m_R$-primary

filtrations. We prove that a theorem of Rees showing that if there is an
inclusion of $m_R$-primary ideals $I\subset I'$ with the same multiplicity then
$I$ and $I'$ have the same integral closure also holds for divisorial
filtrations. This theorem does not hold for arbitrary filtrations.
  We show that the Teissier Rees Sharp Katz theorem on equality in the
Minkowski inequality holds for divisorial filtrations in an excellent domain of
dimension two.
  We also show that the mixed multiplicities of divisorial filtrations are
anti-positive intersection products on a suitable normal scheme $X$

generate a high-resolution (HR) face image from a low-resolution~(LR) input. In
contrast to the existing patch-wise super-resolution models that divide a face
image into regular patches and independently apply LR to HR mapping to each
patch, we implement deep reinforcement learning and develop a novel
attention-aware face hallucination (Attention-FH) framework, which recurrently
learns to attend a sequence of patches and performs facial part enhancement by
fully exploiting the global interdependency of the image. Specifically, our
proposed framework incorporates two components: a recurrent policy network for
dynamically specifying a new attended region at each time step based on the
status of the super-resolved image and the past attended region sequence, and a
local enhancement network for selected patch hallucination and global state
updating. The Attention-FH model jointly learns the recurrent policy network
and local enhancement network through maximizing a long-term reward that
reflects the hallucination result with respect to the whole HR image. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our Attention-FH significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on in-the-wild face images with large pose and

combining modes based on the first and the fourth Mie resonance of a cylinder
made of high permittivity LiTaO$_3$ for operation in the low THz. The circular
cross-section of each cylinder varies periodically along its length in a binary
way, from small to large, while its overall circular symmetry has to be broken
in order to remove parasitic magnetic modes. Small cross-sections are the main
source of the \textit{electric dipole} Mie mode, while large cross-sections
sustain the fourth, \textit{mixed toroidal dipole} Mie mode. With proper
adjustment, the generated electric and toroidal moments interfere destructively
producing a non-radiating source, the dynamic anapole, the existence of which
is attested by a sharp dip in the reflection from the metasurface, due
exclusively to electric and toroidal dipoles. Moreover, we show that, by
breaking the circular symmetry of each cylinder, a substantial toroidal dipole
emerges from the \textit{magnetic quadrupole} Mie mode, which in combination
with the electric dipole also produces the dynamic anapole. The sensitivity of
the anapole states to the material dissipation losses is examined leading to
the conclusion that the proposed metasurfaces offer a scheme for realistically

adjoint orbit of a classical group over finite quotient rings of the ring of
integer of a non-dyadic non-archimedean local field is presented. The
parametrization is given by means of (a subset of) the character group of the
centralizer of a representative of the regular adjoint orbit. Our method is
based upon Weil representations over finite fields. More explicit
parametrization in terms of tamely ramified extensions of the base field is
given for the general linear group, the special linear group, the symplectic
group and the orthogonal group.

  experimental results",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is one of the most precisely
measured quantities in physics. Its experimental value exhibits a $4.2 \,
\sigma$ discrepancy $\delta a_\mu=(251 \pm 59) \times 10^{-11}$ with its
theoretical value calculated in the standard model framework, while they agree
for the electron. The muon theoretical calculation involves a mass-dependent
contribution which comes from two-loop vacuum polarization insertions due to
electron-positron pairs and depends on the electron to muon mass ratio
$x=m_e/m_\mu$. In standard quantum mechanics, mass ratios and inverse Compton
length ratios are identical. This is no longer the case in the special
scale-relativity framework, in which the Planck length-scale is invariant under
dilations. Using the renormalization group approach, we differentiate between
the origin of $ \ln x$ logarithmic contributions which depend on mass, and $x$
linear contributions which we assume to actually depend on inverse Compton
lengths. By defining the muon constant $\mathbb{C}_\mu=\ln(m_\mathbb{P}/m_\mu)$
in terms of the Planck mass $m_\mathbb{P}$, the resulting scale-relativistic
correction writes $\delta a_\mu= -\alpha^2 \, (x \:\ln^3 x)/(8 \;
\mathbb{C}_\mu^2)$, where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant. Its
numerical value, $(230 \pm 16) \times 10^{-11}$, is in excellent agreement with
the observed theory-experiment difference.

in a one-dimensional bosonic gas following an interspecies interaction quench
from weak to strong repulsions. Monitoring the temporal evolution of the
single-particle density of each species we reveal the existence of four
distinct dynamical regimes. For weak interspecies repulsions both species
either perform a breathing motion or the impurity density splits into two parts
which interact and disperse within the bosonic cloud. Turning to strong
interactions we observe the formation of dark-bright states within the
mean-field approximation. However, the correlated dynamics shows that the
fermionic density splits into two repelling density peaks which either travel
towards the edges of the bosonic cloud where they equilibrate or they approach
an almost steady state propagating robustly within the bosonic gas which forms
density dips at the same location. For these strong interspecies interactions
an energy transfer process from the impurities to their environment occurs at
the many-body level, while a periodic energy exchange from the bright states
(impurities) to the bosonic species is identified in the absence of
correlations. Finally, inspecting the one-body coherence function for strong
interactions enables us to conclude on the spatial localization of the
quench-induced fermionic density humps.

unknown atomic measure from its $M+1$ consecutive noisy Fourier coefficients.
The standard resolution of this inverse problem is $1/M$ and super-resolution
refers to the capability of resolving atoms at a higher resolution. When any
two atoms are less than $1/M$ apart, this recovery problem is highly
challenging and many existing algorithms either cannot deal with this situation
or require restrictive assumptions on the sign of the measure. ESPRIT is an
efficient method that does not depend on the sign of the measure. This paper
provides an explicit error bound on the support matching distance of ESPRIT in
terms of the minimum singular value of Vandermonde matrices. When the support
consists of multiple well-separated clumps and noise is sufficiently small, the
support error by ESPRIT scales like ${\rm SRF}^{2\lambda+2} \times {\rm
Noise}$, where the Super-Resolution Factor (${\rm SRF}$) governs the difficulty
of the problem and $\lambda$ is the cardinality of the largest clump. {If the
support contains one clump of closely spaced atoms, the min-max error is ${\rm
SRF}^{2\lambda +2} \times {\rm Noise}/M$. Our error bound matches the min-max
rate up to a factor of $M$ in the small noise regime. Our results therefore
establishes the near-optimality of ESPRIT,} and our theory is validated by

while the other (reflectance) for degradation removal. In such a way, the
original space is decoupled into two smaller subspaces, expecting to be better

  Engineering Applications",,,,,"cs.NE cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This survey samples from the ever-growing family of adaptive resonance theory
(ART) neural network models used to perform the three primary machine learning
modalities, namely, unsupervised, supervised and reinforcement learning. It
comprises a representative list from classic to modern ART models, thereby
painting a general picture of the architectures developed by researchers over
the past 30 years. The learning dynamics of these ART models are briefly
described, and their distinctive characteristics such as code representation,
long-term memory and corresponding geometric interpretation are discussed.
Useful engineering properties of ART (speed, configurability, explainability,
parallelization and hardware implementation) are examined along with current
challenges. Finally, a compilation of online software libraries is provided. It
is expected that this overview will be helpful to new and seasoned ART
researchers.

lattice structures associated with periodic polygons. In tessellated periodic
representation, it appears two periodic polygons of $k$ sides of unequal side
lengths at certain angles fixed by the underlying discrete symmetries. In this
way, 2D materials could be engineered by using two superstructures on the same
atomic sheet generated by two length parameters $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ and rotated
by the angle $\phi _{n}^{k}=\frac{n\pi }{k}$, where $n$ is an arbitrary natural
number. These geometrical configurations could be exploited to engineer 2D
materials by doubling the number of the ordinary unit cell atoms. To support
the present conjecture, we establish a link with Lie symmetries including
finite and indefinite ones providing a room interpretation for $n$.

validating the opinion of radiologists in CT interpretation. This paper
presents a deep 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for
automated CT scan-based lung cancer detection system. It utilizes three
dimensional spatial information to learn highly discriminative 3 dimensional
features instead of 2D features like texture or geometric shape whick need to
be generated manually. The proposed deep learning method automatically extracts
the 3D features on the basis of spatio-temporal statistics.The developed model
is end-to-end and is able to predict malignancy of each voxel for given input
scan. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed 3D CNN
network for classification of lung nodule in-spite of limited computational
capabilities.

  Security Systems: A Review of Fog Computing",,,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Abstract--- With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), current
Cloud systems face various drawbacks such as lack of mobility support,
location-awareness, geo-distribution, high latency, as well as cyber threats.
Fog/Edge computing has been proposed for addressing some of the drawbacks, as
it enables computing resources at the network's edges and it locally offers
big-data analytics rather than transmitting them to the Cloud. The Fog is
defined as a Cloud-like system having similar functions, including software-,
platform- and infrastructure-as services. The deployment of Fog applications
faces various security issues related to virtualisation, network monitoring,
data protection and attack detection. This paper proposes a systemic
IoT-Fog-Cloud architecture that clarifies the interactions between the three
layers of IoT, Fog and Cloud for effectively implementing big-data analytics
and cyber security applications. It also reviews security challenges, solutions
and future research directions in the architecture.
