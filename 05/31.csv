and the domain users' needs and focus changing too rapidly for the design
process to complete. While it is often prudent to avoid such projects, we argue
it can be beneficial to engage them in some cases as the visualization process
can help refine data collection, solving a ""chicken and egg"" problem of having
the data and tools to analyze it. We found this to be the case in the domain of
task parallel computing where such data and tooling is an open area of
research. Despite these hurdles, we conducted a design study. Through a
tightly-coupled iterative design process, we built Atria, a multi-view
execution graph visualization to support performance analysis. Atria simplifies
the initial representation of the execution graph by aggregating nodes as
related to their line of code. We deployed Atria on multiple platforms, some
requiring design alteration. We describe how we adapted the design study
methodology to the ""moving target"" of both the data and the domain experts'
concerns and how this movement kept both the visualization and programming
project healthy. We reflect on our process and discuss what factors allow the
project to be successful in the presence of changing data and user needs.

coronal loops have been extensively studied both observationally and
theoretically. Almost all driven coronal loop oscillations (e.g., by flares)
are observed to damp through time often with Gaussian or exponential profiles.
Intriguingly, however, it has been shown theoretically that the amplitudes of
some oscillations could be modified from Gaussian or exponential profiles if
cooling is present in the coronal loop systems. Indeed, in some cases the
oscillation amplitude can even increase through time. In this article, we
analyse a flare-driven coronal loop oscillation observed by the Solar Dynamics
Observatory's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) in order to investigate
whether models of cooling can explain the amplitude profile of the oscillation
and whether hints of cooling can be found in the intensity evolution of several
SDO/AIA filters. During the oscillation of this loop system, the kink mode
amplitude appears to differ from a typical Gaussian or exponential profile with
some hints being present that the amplitude increases. The application of
cooling coronal loop modelling allowed us to estimate the density ratio between
the loop and the background plasma, with a ratio of between 2.05-2.35 being
returned. Overall, our results indicate that consideration of the thermal
evolution of coronal loop systems can allow us to better describe oscillations
in these structures and return more accurate estimates of the physical
properties of the loops (e.g., density, scale height, magnetic field strength).

stages of planet formation by enabling the efficient bypass of a number of
barriers hindering the formation of planetesimals. We present the first study
exploring the efficiency of the linear streaming instability when a
particle-size distribution is considered. We find that, for a given dust-to-gas
mass ratio, the multi-species streaming instability grows on timescales much
longer than those expected when only one dust species is involved. In
particular, distributions that contain close-to-order-unity dust-to-gas mass
ratios lead to unstable modes that can grow on timescales comparable, or
larger, with those of secular instabilities. We anticipate that processes
leading to particle segregation and/or concentration can create favourable
conditions for the instability to grow fast. Our findings may have important
implications for a large number of processes in protoplanetary disks that rely
on the streaming instability as usually envisioned for a unique dust species.
Our results suggest that the growth rates of other resonant-drag-instabilities
may also decrease considerably when multiple species are considered.

ones with the same identity. This is a challenging task, as the images to be
matched are generally semantically misaligned due to the diversity of human
poses and capture viewpoints, incompleteness of the visible bodies (due to
occlusion), etc. In this paper, we propose a framework that drives the reID
network to learn semantics-aligned feature representation through delicate
supervision designs. Specifically, we build a Semantics Aligning Network (SAN)
which consists of a base network as encoder (SA-Enc) for re-ID, and a decoder
(SA-Dec) for reconstructing/regressing the densely semantics aligned full
texture image. We jointly train the SAN under the supervisions of person
re-identification and aligned texture generation. Moreover, at the decoder,
besides the reconstruction loss, we add Triplet ReID constraints over the
feature maps as the perceptual losses. The decoder is discarded in the
inference and thus our scheme is computationally efficient. Ablation studies
demonstrate the effectiveness of our design. We achieve the state-of-the-art
performances on the benchmark datasets CUHK03, Market1501, MSMT17, and the
partial person reID dataset Partial REID. Code for our proposed method is

of river levels and river flows recorded at hydrological stations in the
vicinity of dams and in the area of up to 480 km upstream from dams, and time
series of simulated NOAA-CIRES 20th Century Global Reanalysis precipitation
records for the Djerdap/Iron Gates region. By comparing river dynamics during
the periods before and after construction of dams, we were able to register
changes in scaling that are different for recordings from upstream and from
downstream (from dams) areas. We found that damming caused appearance of
human-made or enhancement of natural cycles in the small time scales region,
which largely influenced the change in temporal scaling in downstream recording
stations. We additionally found disappearance or decline in the amplitude of
large-time-scale cycles as a result of damming, that changed the dynamics of
upstream data. The most prominent finding of our paper is a demonstration of a
complete or partial loss of annual cycles in the upstream stations' data that
we found to extend as far as 220 km from dams. We discussed probable sources of
such found changes in scaling, aiming to provide explanations that could be of
use in future environmental assessments.

observing such a visual stimulus would simultaneously induce 1) steady-state
motion visual evoked potential (SSMVEP) in the occipital area, similarly to an
SSVEP stimulus; and 2) sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) in the primary sensorimotor
area, because such action observation (AO) could activate the mirror neuron
system. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was used to detect SSMVEP from
occipital EEG, and event-related spectral perturbations (ERSP) were used to
identify SMR in the EEG from the sensorimotor area. The results showed that the
proposed visual gaiting stimulus-induced SSMVEP, with classification accuracies
of 88.9 $\pm$ 12.0% in a four-class scenario. More importantly, it induced
clear and sustained event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS)
in the EEG from the sensorimotor area, while no ERD/ERS in the sensorimotor
area could be observed when the other two SSVEP stimuli were used. Further, for
participants with sufficiently clear SSMVEP pattern (classification accuracy >
85%), the ERD index values in mu-beta band induced by the proposed gaiting
stimulus were statistically different from that of the other two types of
stimulus. Therefore, a novel BCI based on the proposed stimulus has potential
in neurorehabilitation applications because it simultaneously has the high
accuracy of an SSMVEP (~90% accuracy in a four-class setup) and the ability to
activate sensorimotor cortex. And such potential will be further explored in

lattice model taking into account electronic polarization (EP) of ions and

three mutually independent coefficients of either pair of lattice equations are

electronic and static susceptibilities and phonon frequency, making the lattice
equations very useful for calculating the lattice dynamical properties.
Explicit expressions are obtained for lattice vibrational energy density, and
phonon dispersion, group velocity and density of states. The transparent phonon
dispersion relations describe the previous numerical calculations very well,
and the longitudinal optical (LO) phonon dispersion relation is identical to
the analytical expression of Sohier {\it et al}. [Nano Lett. {\bf 17}, 3758
(2017)]. The out-of-plane phonon frequency is finite owing to ionic EP. A 2D
lattice dielectric function $\epsilon(k,\omega)$ is derived--due solely to the
LO vibrations--which also allows the LO phonon dispersion to be rederived
simply from $\epsilon(k,\omega)=0$, similar to the bulk case. A 2D
Lyddane--Sachs--Teller relation and a frequency--susceptibility relation are
obtained for the in-plane and out-of-plane vibrations, respectively, connecting
the phonon frequencies to the 2D dielectric functions or susceptibilities.
Using three first-principles calculated parameters, the lattice dynamical

connect statistical complexity to the flies' level of conscious arousal, which

of even single channel time series data decreases under anesthesia. The
observed difference in complexity between the two states of conscious arousal
increases as higher orders of temporal correlations are taken into account. We
then go on to show that, in addition to reducing complexity, anesthesia also
modulates the informational structure between the forward- and reverse-time
neural signals. Specifically, using three distinct notions of temporal
asymmetry we show that anesthesia reduces temporal asymmetry on
information-theoretic and information-geometric grounds. In contrast to prior
work, our results show that: (1) Complexity differences can emerge at very
short timescales and across broad regions of the fly brain, thus heralding the
macroscopic state of anesthesia in a previously unforeseen manner, and (2) that

better practical performance, as GNNs use multi-layer architectures and
non-linear activation functions to extract high-order information of graphs as
features. However, due to the large number of hyper-parameters and the
non-convex nature of the training procedure, GNNs are harder to train.
Theoretical guarantees of GNNs are also not well-understood. Furthermore, the

hard to exploit the full power of GNNs when computing resources are limited.
The current paper presents a new class of graph kernels, Graph Neural Tangent

the presence of a confounder for the relation between the input data and the

define the system of Roy-Steiner equations for the partial-wave helicity
amplitudes. We then formulate the solution of these partial-wave dispersion
relations in terms of Omn\`es functions, with special attention paid to the
role of subtraction constants as critical for the application to hadronic
light-by-light scattering. In particular, we explain for the first time why for
some amplitudes the standard Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es solution applies, while for
others a modified approach based on their left-hand cut is required unless
subtractions are introduced. In the doubly-virtual case, the analytic structure
of the vector-resonance partial waves then gives rise to anomalous thresholds,
even for space-like virtualities. We develop a strategy to account for these

$\gamma^*\gamma^*\to\pi\pi$, which allows us to predict the doubly-virtual

model leverages the prior observations of the channel to achieve two
objectives. First, it optimizes the compressive channel sensing vectors based
on the surrounding environment in an unsupervised manner to focus the sensing
power on the most promising spatial directions. This is enabled by a novel
neural network architecture that accounts for the constraints on the RF chains
and models the transmitter/receiver measurement matrices as two complex-valued
convolutional layers. Second, the proposed model learns how to construct the RF
beamforming vectors of the hybrid architectures directly from the projected
channel vector (the received sensing vector). The auto-precoder neural network
that incorporates both the channel sensing and beam prediction is trained
end-to-end as a multi-task classification problem. Thanks to this design
methodology that leverages the prior channel observations and the implicit
awareness about the surrounding environment/user distributions, the proposed
approach significantly reduces the training overhead compared to classical
(non-machine learning) solutions. For example, for a system of 64 transmit and
64 receive antennas, with 3 RF chains at both sides, the proposed solution
needs only 8 or 16 channel training pilots to directly predict the RF

color charge governing their mutual interactions: attractive for equal colors
and repulsive otherwise. The number of allowed colors is fixed only by the
discrete spatial symmetries of the sign-changing part of the interaction
potential. With increasing interaction range, the droplets become progressively
more mobile, with their color charge still being energetically protected,
allowing for nontrivial viscous dynamics of the interacting droplet plasmas
formed during cooling. Sign-changing potentials with a short-range attraction
appear quite naturally for light-mediated interactions and we concretely
propose a realization in state-of-the-art experiments with cold atoms in a
multimode optical cavity.

zero-free-energy initial state through filament-channel formation to violent
eruption, driven solely by the magnetic-helicity condensation process. Helicity
is the topological measure of linkages between magnetic flux systems, and is
conserved in the corona, building up inexorably until it is ejected into
interplanetary space. Numerous investigations have demonstrated that helicity
injected by small-scale vortical motions, such as those observed in the
photosphere, undergoes an inverse cascade from small scales to large,
`condensing' at magnetic-polarity boundaries. Our new results verify that this
process forms a filament channel within a compact bipolar region embedded in a
background dipole field, and show for the first time that a fast CME eventually
occurs via the magnetic-breakout mechanism. We further show that the trigger
for explosive eruption is reconnection onset in the flare current sheet that
develops above the polarity inversion line: this reconnection forms flare loops
below the sheet and a CME flux rope above, and initiates high-speed outward
flow of the CME. Our findings have important implications for magnetic
self-organization and explosive behavior in solar and other astrophysical
plasmas, and for understanding and predicting explosive solar activity.

EeV-range mass is distributed over the galactic halo and disintegrates into a
pair of lighter -- highly boosted -- dark-matter states in the present universe

off a nucleon and produces a heavier dark-sector unstable state which
subsequently decays back to the lighter dark matter along with hadrons, which
induce Extensive Air Showers, via on-/off-shell dark gauge boson. Depending on
the mass hierarchy within the dark sector, either the dark gauge boson or the
unstable dark-sector particle can be long-lived, hence transmitted
significantly through the Earth. We study the angular distribution of the

25^\circ -35^\circ$ if the associated parameter choices bear the situation
where the mean free path of the boosted incident particle is much larger than
the Earth diameter while its long-lived decay product has a decay length of

from its surface. All considered clumps remain gravitationally unstable even if
radiation rips off most of the clump mass, showing that external FUV radiation
is not able to stop clump collapse. However, the FUV intensity regulates the
final H$_2$ mass available for star formation: for example, for $G_0 < 10^4$
more than 10% of the initial clump mass survives. Finally, for massive clumps

expulsion can explain the observed line-of-sight (LoS) velocity dispersion
profile of NGC 2419 in Newtonian dynamics. For a given star formation
efficiency (SFE), the shapes of the velocity dispersion profiles, which are
normalised by the velocity dispersion at the projected half-mass radius, are
almost indistinguishable for different SFE models in Newtonian dynamics. The
velocity dispersion of a star cluster in the outer halo of a galaxy can indeed
have a strong radial anisotropy in Newtonian dynamics after gas expulsion. MOND
displays several different properties from Newtonian dynamics. In particular,
the slope of the central velocity dispersion profile is less steep in MOND for
the same SFE. Moreover, for a given SFE, more massive embedded cluster models
result in more rapidly declining central velocity dispersion profiles for the
final star clusters, while less massive embedded cluster models lead to flatter
velocity dispersion profiles for the final products. The onset of the
radial-orbit instability in post-gas-expulsion MOND models is discussed. SFEs
as low as a few percent, typical of molecular clouds, lead to surviving
ultra-diffuse objects. Gas expulsion alone is unlikely the physical mechanism

the mass distribution modeling. When compared to our previous lens models, the
inclusion of member galaxies' kinematics provides a similar precision in

degeneracy between the central effective velocity dispersion, $\sigma_0$, and

significantly alleviating possible systematics in the measurements of sub-halo

quasinormal bursts (QNBs) appear directly in the waveform following each

least-damped overtone (i.e., fundamental) of at least four ($l=m \le 4$)
quasinormal modes. Our results suggest that QNBs should appear in gravitational
waveforms, and thus provide a gauge-invariant signal. Potentially observable in
high signal-to-noise ratio EMRIs, QNBs would provide high-frequency components
to the parameter estimation problem that would complement low-frequency
elements of the waveform.

manipulate, and disperse light from one or more telescopes to achieve
scientific objectives in astronomy in an efficient and cost-effective way.
Utilizing photonic advantage for astronomical spectroscopy is a promising
approach to miniaturizing the next generation of spectrometers for large
telescopes. It can be primarily attained by leveraging the two-dimensional
nature of photonic structures on a chip or a set of fibers, thus reducing the
size of spectroscopic instrumentation to a few centimeters and the weight to a
few hundred grams. A wide variety of astrophotonic spectrometers is currently
being developed, including arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs), photonic echelle
gratings (PEGs), and Fourier-transform spectrometer (FTS). These astrophotonic
devices are flexible, cheaper to mass produce, easier to control, and much less
susceptible to vibrations and flexure than conventional astronomical
spectrographs. The applications of these spectrographs range from astronomy to
biomedical analysis. This paper provides a brief review of this new class of
astronomical spectrographs.

affirmed the existence of the well-known Brown-Dwarf Desert (BDD). They
detected a dearth of spectroscopic binaries (SB) with periods shorter than
$\sim 10$ - $30$ days and secondaries with masses in the range of $\sim0.01$ -
$0.1\, M_{\odot}$. We reconsider here their sample of binaries, focusing on 116
systems on the main sequence of the Gaia color-magnitude diagram, with mostly
K-dwarf primaries. Using our recently devised algorithm to analyze the
mass-ratio distribution of a sample of SBs we confirm the BDD existence and
delineate its boundaries. For the K-dwarf APOGEE $1$ - $25$ days binaries, the
companion-mass range of the BDD is $\sim0.02$ - $0.2\, M_{\odot}$. The mass
ratio distribution of the long-period ($25$ - $500$ days) binaries does not
show any dearth at the $q$-range studied. Instead, their distribution displays
a linear increase in $\log q$, implying a tendency towards low-$q$ values. The
limits of the BDD do not coincide with the frequently used mass limits of the
brown-dwarf population, sometimes defined as $0.013$ and $0.08\, M_{\odot}$,
based on theoretically derived stellar minimum masses for burning deuterium and
hydrogen in their cores. Trying to draw the boundaries of the desert, we
suggest either a wedged or trapezoidal shape. We discuss briefly different
scenarios that can account for the formation of the BDD, in terms of
differentiating between stellar secondaries and planets in particular, and
compare this desert to the Neptunian desert that can distinguish between Jovian
planets and super Earths of short periods.

miniaturized, and cost-effective instruments for the next generation of large
telescopes. For various astronomical studies such as probing the early
universe, observing in near infrared (NIR) is crucial. To address this, we are
developing moderate resolution (R = 1500) on-chip astrophotonic spectrographs
in the NIR bands (J Band: 1.1-1.4 $\mu m$; H band: 1.45-1.7 $\mu m$) using the
concept of arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs). We fabricate the AWGs using a
silica-on-silicon substrate. The waveguides on these AWGs are 2 $\mu m$ wide
and 0.1 $\mu m$ high Si3N4 core buried inside a 15 $\mu m$ thick SiO2 cladding.
To make the maximal use of astrophotonic integration such as coupling the AWGs
with multiple single-mode fibers coming from photonic lanterns or fiber Bragg
gratings (FBGs), we require a multi-input AWG design. In a multi-input AWG, the
output spectrum due to each individual input channel overlaps to produce a
combined spectrum from all inputs. This on-chip combination of light
effectively improves the signal-to-noise ratio as compared to spreading the
photons to several AWGs with single inputs. In this paper, we present the
design and simulation results of an AWG in the H band with 3 input waveguides
(channels). The resolving power of individual input channels is 1500, while the
overall resolving power with three inputs together is 500, 600, 750 in three
different configurations simulated here. The free spectral range of the device
is 9.5 nm around a central wavelength of 1600 nm. For the standard multi-input
AWG, the relative shift between the output spectra due to adjacent input
channels is about 1.6 nm, which roughly equals one spectral channel spacing. In
this paper, we discuss ways to increase the resolving power and the number of
inputs without compromising the free spectral range or throughput.

full extent of the tail at 1"" (350 pc) angular resolution and found a rich
distribution of mostly compact CO regions extending to nearly 60 kpc in length
and 25 kpc in width. In total about 10^9 M_sun of molecular gas was detected.
The CO features are found predominantly at the heads of numerous small-scale (~
1.5 kpc) fireballs (i.e., star-forming clouds with linear streams of young
stars extending toward the galaxy) but also of large-scale (~ 8 kpc)
super-fireballs, and double-sided fireballs that have additional diffuse
ionized gas tails extending in the direction opposite to the stellar tails. The
new data help to shed light on the origin of the molecular tail - CO filaments
oriented in the direction of the tail with only diffuse associated Halpha
emission are likely young molecular features formed in situ, whereas other
large CO features tilted with respect to the tail may have originated from the
densest gas complexes that were pushed gradually away from the disk. The ALMA

the spectral efficiency directly in the physical layer of the radio-frequency

magnetic bias to ferrite materials, therefore conventional circulators are
bulky and expensive. In this paper, this problem is addressed by replacing the
magnetic bias with periodic spatiotemporal modulation. Compared to previous
works, the proposed circulator is constructed using surface acoustic wave (SAW)
filters instead of transmission lines (TL), which reduces the modulation
frequency by at least a factor of 20 and ensures ultra-low power consumption
and high linearity. The miniaturized high quality (Q) factor SAW filters also
lead to a low-loss non-reciprocal band with strong isolation (IX) and broad
bandwidth (BW) on a chip scale, therefore addressing such limitations in
previous magnet-free demonstrations. Furthermore, compared to the conventional

main cause of such error-rise process through examination of switching
statistics as a function of bias voltage and applied field, and the junction
switching dynamics in real time. These experiments show a coincidental onset of
error-rise and the presence of a new low-frequency microwave emission well
below that dictated by the anisotropy field. We show that in a few-macrospin
coupled numerical model, this is consistent with an interface region with

to show a delocalization-localization transition at a finite strength of the
quasi-periodic disorder. In this work, we point out that an intimate
relationship exists between the sub-band structure of the spectrum and
transport properties of the model. To capture the transport properties we have
not only used a variety of single-particle measures like inverse participation
ratio, and von Neumann entropy, but also many-particle measures such as
persistent current and its variance, and many body entanglement entropy. The
many-particle measures are very sensitive to the sub-band structure of the
spectrum. Even in the delocalized phase, surprisingly the entanglement entropy
is substantially suppressed when the Fermi level is in the band gaps whereas
the persistent current is vanishingly small for the same locations of the Fermi
level. The entanglement entropy seems to follow area-law exclusively for these
special locations of Fermi level or filling fractions of free fermions. A study
of the standard deviation of persistent current offers further distinguishing
features for the special fillings. In the delocalized phase, the standard
deviation vs. mean persistent current curves are discontinuous for the
non-special values of filling fractions and continuous (closed) for the special
values of filling fractions whereas in the localized phase, these curves become
straight lines for both types of filling fractions. We have also discussed how
the results depend on the system size. Our results, specially on the persistent

addressing this problem, this work focuses on the utility of pass-efficient,

high-dimensional simulation data from turbulent flows. A particular emphasis is
placed on using coarse representation of the data -- compatible with the PDE
discretization grid -- to accelerate the construction of the low-rank

maintaining accuracy with respect to first- and second-order flow statistics.
In the particle-laden case, compression factors of 100 are achieved and the

new classes incrementally. The performance dramatically degrades due to the
missing data of old classes. Incremental learning methods have been proposed to
retain the knowledge acquired from the old classes, by using knowledge
distilling and keeping a few exemplars from the old classes. However, these
methods struggle to scale up to a large number of classes. We believe this is
because of the combination of two factors: (a) the data imbalance between the

Distinguishing between an increasing number of visually similar classes is
particularly challenging, when the training data is unbalanced. We propose a
simple and effective method to address this data imbalance issue. We found that
the last fully connected layer has a strong bias towards the new classes, and
this bias can be corrected by a linear model. With two bias parameters, our

structures around the Milky Way, Andromeda, and Centaurus A, we use an
N-body/test particle simulation to show that low-mass dwarf satellites within
such structures are able to exert significant influence on their host's disc,
driving spiral waves and inducing stellar scattering. This is accomplished
through quasi-periodic alignments of multiple small satellites within the
structure that emulate the gravitational influence of a single, larger
satellite such as Sagittarius Dwarf or the Large Magellanic Cloud. We find that
the coplanar, corotational nature of such structures allows for repeated
alignments on short enough timescales to overcome damping within the disc, and
in a consistent enough fashion to continually drive spiral waves over the
course of 2 Gyr of simulation time. The spirals driven by this phenomenon tend
to be flocculent and many-armed due to the irregular intervals over which
alignments occur. We additionally find that while the aligned satellites are
able to induce noticeable thickening of the disc, their ability to drive
surface density profile evolution is secondary to other effects.

anonymization techniques aim to protect individual users in a graph, while
graph de-anonymization aims to re-identify users. The effectiveness of
anonymization and de-anonymization algorithms is usually evaluated with privacy
metrics. However, it is unclear how strong existing privacy metrics are when
they are used in graph privacy. In this paper, we study 26 privacy metrics for
graph anonymization and de-anonymization and evaluate their strength in terms
of three criteria: monotonicity indicates whether the metric indicates lower
privacy for stronger adversaries; for within-scenario comparisons, evenness
indicates whether metric values are spread evenly; and for between-scenario
comparisons, shared value range indicates whether metrics use a consistent
value range across scenarios. Our extensive experiments indicate that no single
metric fulfills all three criteria perfectly. We therefore use methods from
multi-criteria decision analysis to aggregate multiple metrics in a metrics
suite, and we show that these metrics suites improve monotonicity compared to
the best individual metric. This important result enables more monotonic, and
thus more accurate, evaluations of new graph anonymization and de-anonymization
algorithms.

epsilon-lexicase selection, that redefines the pass condition for individuals

real-world and synthetic problems with several treatments of epsilon and
quantify how epsilon affects parent selection and model performance.
epsilon-lexicase selection is shown to be effective for regression, producing
better fit models compared to other techniques such as tournament selection and
age-fitness Pareto optimization. We demonstrate that epsilon can be adapted
automatically for individual test cases based on the population performance
distribution. Our experiments show that epsilon-lexicase selection with
automatic epsilon produces the most accurate models across tested problems with
negligible computational overhead. We show that behavioral diversity is
exceptionally high in lexicase selection treatments, and that epsilon-lexicase
selection makes use of more fitness cases when selecting parents than lexicase
selection, which helps explain the performance improvement.

Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers. PID controllers perform
well on linear and near-linear systems but their simplicity is at odds with the
robustness required to reliably control complex processes. Modern machine
learning offers a way to extend PID controllers beyond their linear
capabilities by using neural networks. However, such an extension comes at the
cost of losing stability guarantees and controller interpretability. In this
paper, we examine the utility of extending PID controllers with recurrent
neural networks-namely, General Dynamic Neural Networks (GDNN); we show that
GDNN (neural) PID controllers perform well on a range of control systems and
highlight how they can be a scalable and interpretable option for control
systems. To do so, we provide an extensive study using four benchmark systems
that represent the most common control engineering benchmarks. All control
benchmarks are evaluated with and without noise as well as with and without
disturbances. The neural PID controller performs better than standard PID
control in 15 of 16 tasks and better than model-based control in 13 of 16
tasks. As a second contribution, we address the lack of interpretability that
prevents neural networks from being used in real-world control processes. We
use bounded-input bounded-output stability analysis to evaluate the parameters
suggested by the neural network, thus making them understandable. This
combination of rigorous evaluation paired with better interpretability is an
important step towards the acceptance of neural-network-based control
approaches. It is furthermore an important step towards interpretable and

  Augmentation Affect Early Learning Dynamics, Matter Little Near Convergence",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Regularization is typically understood as improving generalization by
altering the landscape of local extrema to which the model eventually
converges. Deep neural networks (DNNs), however, challenge this view: We show
that removing regularization after an initial transient period has little
effect on generalization, even if the final loss landscape is the same as if
there had been no regularization. In some cases, generalization even improves
after interrupting regularization. Conversely, if regularization is applied
only after the initial transient, it has no effect on the final solution, whose
generalization gap is as bad as if regularization never happened. This suggests
that what matters for training deep networks is not just whether or how, but
when to regularize. The phenomena we observe are manifest in different datasets
(CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100), different architectures (ResNet-18, All-CNN), different
regularization methods (weight decay, data augmentation), different learning
rate schedules (exponential, piece-wise constant). They collectively suggest
that there is a ``critical period'' for regularizing deep networks that is
decisive of the final performance. More analysis should, therefore, focus on
the transient rather than asymptotic behavior of learning.

non-invertible anomaly is that it has several partition functions. Under the
mapping class group transformation of space-time, those partition functions
transform in a certain way characterized by the data of the corresponding
topological order in one higher dimension. In fact, the anomalous partition
functions transform in the same way as the degenerate ground states of the
corresponding topological order in one higher dimension. This general theory of
non-invertible anomaly may have wide applications. As an example, we show that

for studying and understanding condensed-phase chemical dynamics. Although TTR
spectra carry rich information about the systems under study, the response is
encoded in a three-point correlation function comprising of both dipole and
polarizability elements. Theoretical methods are necessary for the
interpretation of the experimental results. In this work, we study the
liquid-phase dynamics of bromoform, a polarizable molecule with a strong TTR
response. Previous work based on reduced density matrix (RDM) simulations
suggests that unusually large multi-quanta dipole matrix elements are needed to
understand the measured spectrum of bromoform. Here, we demonstrate that a
self-consistent definition of the time coordinates with respect to the
reference pulse leads to a simplified experimental spectrum. Furthermore, we
analytically derive a parametrization for the RDM model by integrating the
dipole and polarizability elements to the 4th order in the normal modes, and we
enforce inversion symmetry in the calculations by numerically cancelling the
components of the response that are even with respect to the field. The
resulting analysis eliminates the need to invoke large multi-quanta dipole
matrix elements to fit the experimental spectrum; instead, the experimental
spectrum is recovered using RDM simulations with dipole matrix parameters that
are in agreement with independent ab initio calculations. The fundamental
interpretation of the TTR signatures in terms of coupled intramolecular
vibrational modes remains unchanged from the previous work.

we make no assumption on the rank of the unknown tensor, but attempt to predict
unknown entries as well as the best rank-$r$ tensor.
  For agnostic learning of third-order tensors with the square loss, we give
the first polynomial time algorithm that obtains a ""fast"" (i.e., $O(1/n)$-type)
rate improving over the rate obtained by reduction to matrix completion. Our
prediction error rate to compete with the best $d\times{}d\times{}d$ tensor of

  Our algorithm is based on the degree-six sum-of-squares relaxation of the
tensor nuclear norm. The key feature of our analysis is to show that a certain
characterization for the subgradient of the tensor nuclear norm can be encoded

localization of empirical processes under the square loss, and allows us to
establish restricted eigenvalue-type guarantees for various tensor regression

range of real-world datasets, the predicted effect (using influence functions)
of a group correlates surprisingly well with its actual effect, even if the
absolute and relative errors are large. Our theoretical analysis shows that
such strong correlation arises only under certain settings and need not hold in

neural networks (CNNs) are major bottlenecks of model deployment to edge
computing platforms, e.g., mobile devices and IoT. Moreover, training CNNs is
time and energy-intensive even on high-grade servers. Convolution layers and
fully connected layers, because of their intense use of multiplications, are
the dominant contributor to this computation budget.
  We propose to alleviate this problem by introducing two new operations:
convolutional shifts and fully-connected shifts which replace multiplications
with bitwise shift and sign flipping during both training and inference. During
inference, both approaches require only 5 bits (or less) to represent the
weights. This family of neural network architectures (that use convolutional
shifts and fully connected shifts) is referred to as DeepShift models. We
propose two methods to train DeepShift models: DeepShift-Q which trains regular
weights constrained to powers of 2, and DeepShift-PS that trains the values of
the shifts and sign flips directly.
  Very close accuracy, and in some cases higher accuracy, to baselines are
achieved. Converting pre-trained 32-bit floating-point baseline models of
ResNet18, ResNet50, VGG16, and GoogleNet to DeepShift and training them for 15
to 30 epochs, resulted in Top-1/Top-5 accuracies higher than that of the
original model.
  Last but not least, we implemented the convolutional shifts and fully
connected shift GPU kernels and showed a reduction in latency time of 25% when
inferring ResNet18 compared to unoptimized multiplication-based GPU kernels.

operator space theory is a quantization of classical functional analysis. Basic
objects of free analysis are noncommutative functions. These are maps on tuples
of matrices of all sizes that preserve direct sums and similarities.
  This paper investigates the local theory of noncommutative functions. The
first main result shows that for a scalar point $Y$, the ring $O_Y$ of
uniformly analytic noncommutative germs about $Y$ is an integral domain and
admits a universal skew field of fractions, whose elements are called
meromorphic germs. A corollary is a local-global rank principle that connects
ranks of matrix evaluations of a matrix $A$ over $O_Y$ with the factorization
of $A$ over $O_Y$. Different phenomena occur for a semisimple tuple of
non-scalar matrices $Y$. Here it is shown that $O_Y$ contains copies of the
matrix algebra generated by $Y$. In particular, there exist nonzero nilpotent
uniformly analytic functions defined in a neighborhood of $Y$, and $O_Y$ does
not embed into a skew field. Nevertheless, the ring $O_Y$ is described as the
completion of a free algebra with respect to the vanishing ideal at $Y$. This
is a consequence of the second main result, a free Hermite interpolation
theorem: if $f$ is a noncommutative function, then for any finite set of
semisimple points and a natural number $L$ there exists a noncommutative
polynomial that agrees with $f$ at the chosen points up to differentials of
order $L$. All the obtained results also have analogs for (non-uniformly)
analytic germs and formal germs.

important quantity in chemical photocatalysis, with relevant applications
ranging from triplet fusion in optical upconversion to the design of organic
light-emitting devices. The ab initio prediction of singlet-triplet (ST) gaps
is challenging due to the potentially biradical nature of the involved states,
combined with the potentially large size of relevant molecules. In this work,
we show that phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) can
accurately predict ST gaps for chemical systems with singlet states of highly
biradical nature, including a set of 13 small molecules and the ortho-, meta-,
and para-isomers of benzyne. With respect to gas-phase experiments, ph-AFQMC
using CASSCF trial wavefunctions achieves a mean averaged error of ~1 kcal/mol.
Furthermore, we find that in the context of a spin-projection technique,
ph-AFQMC using unrestricted single-determinant trial wavefunctions, which can
be readily obtained for even very large systems, produces equivalently high
accuracy. We proceed to show that this scalable methodology is capable of
yielding accurate ST gaps for all linear polyacenes for which experimental
measurements exist, i.e. naphthalene, anthracene, tetracene, and pentacene. Our
results suggest a protocol for selecting either unrestricted Hartree-Fock or
Kohn-Sham orbitals for the single-determinant trial wavefunction, based on the
extent of spin-contamination. These findings pave the way for future
investigations of specific photochemical processes involving large molecules

chemical potential induced by the chiral fermion production are large enough to

agents that learn, plan, and act in sequential environments. Model-based

an action and outputs the next state---a one-step model. This model can be
composed with itself to enable predicting multiple steps into the future, but

empirical results indicate that the multi-step model is more conducive to
efficient value-function estimation, and it yields better action selection

distances, an O$_2$ molecule was found to prefer a horizontal orientation,
where the O-O bond is parallel to the graphene surface, to the vertical
orientation. However, the vertical orientation is favored at the O$_2$-graphene
distances shorter than the equilibrium distance, which could be understood by
the steric repulsion between O and C atoms. Contrary to previous DFT
calculations, our DMC calculations show that the midpoint of a C-C bond (a
bridge site) is energetically preferred for the O$_2$ adsorption to a center of
a hexagonal ring (a hollow site). The lowest DMC adsorption energy was found at
an intermediate point between a hollow and a bridge site, where the O$_2$

on the cosmic background value of the scalar field $f_{R0}$, as well as the
mass, size and environment of the galaxy. We search for this signature of
modified gravity in the SPARC sample of measured rotation curves, using an MCMC
technique to derive constraints on $f_{R0}$. Assuming NFW dark matter haloes
and with $f_{R0}$ freely varying for each galaxy, most galaxies prefer $f(R)$
gravity to $\Lambda$CDM, but there is a large spread of inferred $f_{R0}$
values, inconsistent with a single global value. Requiring instead a consistent
$f_{R0}$ value for the whole sample, models with $\log_{10}|f_{R0}| > -6.1$ are
excluded. On the other hand, models in the range $-7.5<\log_{10}|f_{R0}|<-6.5$
seem to be favoured with respect to $\Lambda$CDM, with a significant peak at
-7. However, this signal is largely a result of galaxies for which the $f(R)$
signal is degenerate with the core/cusp problem, and when the NFW profile is
replaced with a cored halo profile, $\Lambda$CDM gives better fits than any
given $f(R)$ model. Thus, we find no convincing evidence of $f(R)$ gravity down
to the level of $|f_{R0}| \sim 6 \times 10^{-8}$, with the caveat that if cored
halo density profiles cannot ultimately be explained within $\Lambda$CDM, a
screened modified gravity theory could possibly provide an alternative solution
for the core/cusp problem. However, the $f(R)$ models studied here fall short
of achieving this.

secrets by measuring the cache access patterns. Practical attacks have been
shown against real-world crypto algorithm implementations such as RSA, AES, and
ElGamal. By far, identifying information leaks due to cache-based side
channels, either in a static or dynamic manner, remains a challenge: the
existing approaches fail to offer high precision, full coverage, and good
scalability simultaneously, thus impeding their practical use in real-world
scenarios.
  In this paper, we propose a novel static analysis method on binaries to
detect cache-based side channels. We use abstract interpretation to reason on
program states with respect to abstract values at each program point. To make
such abstract interpretation scalable to real-world cryptosystems while
offering high precision and full coverage, we propose a novel abstract domain
called the Secret-Augmented Symbolic domain (SAS). SAS tracks program secrets
and dependencies on them for precision, while it tracks only coarse-grained
public information for scalability.
  We have implemented the proposed technique into a practical tool named CacheS
and evaluated it on the implementations of widely-used cryptographic algorithms
in real-world crypto libraries, including Libgcrypt, OpenSSL, and mbedTLS.
CacheS successfully confirmed a total of 154 information leaks reported by
previous research and 54 leaks that were previously unknown. We have reported
our findings to the developers. And they confirmed that many of those unknown
information leaks do lead to potential side channels.

extending across three orders of magnitude in stellar mass. We identify and
characterize outflows from the \hbeta, [OIII], \halpha ~and [NII] emission line
spectra. We detect outflows in $17\%$ of the AGNs, seven times more often than
in a mass-matched sample of inactive galaxies in MOSDEF. The outflows are fast
and galaxy-wide, with velocities of $\sim 400-3500 ~\mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$ and
spatial extents of $0.3-11.0$ kpc. The incidence of outflows among AGNs is
independent of the stellar mass of the host galaxy, with outflows detected in
both star-forming and quiescent galaxies. This suggests that outflows exist
across different phases in galaxy evolution. We investigate relations between
outflow kinematic, spatial, and energetic properties and both AGN and host
galaxy properties. Our results show that AGN-driven outflows are widespread in
galaxies along the star-forming main sequence. The mass-loading factors of the
outflows are typically $0.1-1$ and increase with AGN luminosity, capable of
exceeding unity at $L_\mathrm{AGN} \gtrsim 10^{46.3} \mathrm{~erg~s}^{-1}$. In
these more luminous sources the ionized outflow alone is likely sufficient to
regulate star formation, and when combined with outflowing neutral and
molecular gas may be able to quench star formation in their host galaxies.

linked to the fact that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) finds solutions that

network is resilient to small random noise added to its parameters. So far this
observation has been used to provide generalization guarantees only for neural
networks whose parameters are either \textit{stochastic} or
\textit{compressed}. In this work, we present a general PAC-Bayesian framework
that leverages this observation to provide a bound on the original network
learned -- a network that is deterministic and uncompressed. What enables us to
do this is a key novelty in our approach: our framework allows us to show that
if on training data, the interactions between the weight matrices satisfy
certain conditions that imply a wide training loss minimum, these conditions
themselves {\em generalize} to the interactions between the matrices on test
data, thereby implying a wide test loss minimum. We then apply our general
framework in a setup where we assume that the pre-activation values of the
network are not too small (although we assume this only on the training data).
In this setup, we provide a generalization guarantee for the original
(deterministic, uncompressed) network, that does not scale with product of the
spectral norms of the weight matrices -- a guarantee that would not have been
possible with prior approaches.

cost efficiency remain challenges at large scales. Developers must manually
search through thousands of model-variants -- versions of already-trained
models that differ in hardware, resource footprints, latencies, costs, and
accuracies -- to meet the diverse application requirements. Since requirements,
query load, and applications themselves evolve over time, these decisions need
to be made dynamically for each inference query to avoid excessive costs
through naive autoscaling. To avoid navigating through the large and complex
trade-off space of model-variants, developers often fix a variant across
queries, and replicate it when load increases. However, given the diversity
across variants and hardware platforms in the cloud, a lack of understanding of
the trade-off space can incur significant costs to developers.
  This paper introduces INFaaS, a managed and model-less system for distributed
inference serving, where developers simply specify the performance and accuracy
requirements for their applications without needing to specify a specific
model-variant for each query. INFaaS generates model-variants, and efficiently
navigates the large trade-off space of model-variants on behalf of developers
to meet application-specific objectives: (a) for each query, it selects a
model, hardware architecture, and model optimizations, (b) it combines VM-level
horizontal autoscaling with model-level autoscaling, where multiple, different
model-variants are used to serve queries within each machine. By leveraging
diverse variants and sharing hardware resources across models, INFaaS achieves
1.3x higher throughput, violates latency objectives 1.6x less often, and saves
up to 21.6x in cost (8.5x on average) compared to state-of-the-art inference
serving systems on AWS EC2.

secure communication for IoT devices is of paramount importance. Achieving
end-to-end encryption for large-scale IoT systems, like smart buildings or

indirectly via intermediaries, meaning that the recipient of a message is not

and signs messages end-to-end, while conforming to the decoupled communication
model typical of IoT systems. JEDI's keys support expiry and fine-grained

their keys, restricted in expiry or scope, to other principals, thereby
granting access to data and managing access control in a scalable, distributed

the spectrum of IoT devices, including ultra low-power deeply embedded sensors

large range of stellar masses ($M_*\sim 10^3$-$10^{11}M_\odot$) and dark matter
(DM) halo masses ($M_{\rm halo}\sim 10^9$-$10^{15}h^{-1}M_\odot$). In this
work, we construct a chemical evolution model to investigate the origin of the
MZR, including both the effects of gas inflows and outflows in galaxies. We
solve the MZR from the chemical evolution model, by assuming that the cold gas
mass ($M_{\rm cold}$) and the stellar feedback efficiency ($\beta$) follow some
power-law scaling relationships with $M_*$ during the growth of a galaxy, i.e.,
$M_{\rm cold}\propto M_*^{\alpha_{\rm gs}}$ and $\beta\propto
M_*^{\alpha_{\beta{\rm s}}}$. We use the SAM to obtain these power-law scaling
relations, which appear to be roughly universal over a large range of stellar
masses for both satellites and central galaxies within a large range of halo
masses. The range of the MZRs produced by our models is in a narrow space,
which provides support to the universality of the MZRs. The formation of the
MZR is a result caused jointly by that the cold gas fraction decreases with
increasing $M_*$ and by that the stellar feedback efficiency decreases with
increasing $M_*$ in the galaxy growth, and the exponent in the MZR is around
$-\alpha_{\beta{\rm s}}$ or $1-\alpha_{\rm gs}$. The MZR represents an
''average'' evolutional track for the stellar metallicity of a galaxy. The
comparison of our model with some previous models for the origin of MZRs is
also discussed.

computing nodes, interconnected via backhaul links, desire to determine an

configurations are considered: First, an infinite-capacity backhaul enables
nodes to communicate in a lossless way, thereby obtaining the solution by
centralized computations. Second, a practical finite-capacity backhaul leads to
the deployment of distributed solvers equipped along with quantizers for
communication through capacity-limited backhaul. The distributed nature and the
nonconvexity of the optimizations render the identification of the solution
unwieldy. To handle them, deep neural networks (DNNs) are introduced to
approximate an unknown computation for the solution accurately. In consequence,
the original problems are transformed to training tasks of the DNNs subject to
non-convex constraints where existing DL libraries fail to extend
straightforwardly. A constrained training strategy is developed based on the
primal-dual method. For distributed implementation, a novel binarization

a scaling Student t-distribution to solve the challenging initialization

distributions. Lastly, we align the two distributions via minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-diverence) with stochastic gradient descent
(SGD), by which an intuitive similarity constraint is imposed to update hashing

adjusting the scaling of the skip connection or the values of the weights in a

machine learning problems has not been reflected in document structure analysis
since conventional neural networks are not well suited to the input structure
of the problem. In this paper, we propose an architecture based on graph
networks as a better alternative to standard neural networks for table
recognition. We argue that graph networks are a more natural choice for these
problems, and explore two gradient-based graph neural networks. Our proposed
architecture combines the benefits of convolutional neural networks for visual
feature extraction and graph networks for dealing with the problem structure.
We empirically demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline by a
significant margin. In addition, we identify the lack of large scale datasets
as a major hindrance for deep learning research for structure analysis and
present a new large scale synthetic dataset for the problem of table
recognition. Finally, we open-source our implementation of dataset generation
and the training framework of our graph networks to promote reproducible
research in this direction.

technologies, including quantum information processing and long-distance

being compatible with the photon-electron interfaces and relax the
dispersion-induced entanglement-degradation in the network mediums. However,
such Giga-hertz-level bandwidth is a challenge for the photonic entanglement
based on conventional spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Here we introduce
a state-of-art domain-engineering technology for the counterpropagating phase
matching in the polarization-entanglement generation, which results in an
inherent bandwidth of 7.1 GHz at telecom wavelength. This geometry also
resolves the fundamental challenge for the deterministic separation of the
entangled photon pairs at frequency degeneracy, so that efficient collinear
interaction can be achieved in a periodically-poled KTP waveguide and results
in a spectral brightness of 3.4*10^3(GHz*mW*s)^-1. The 155 ps base-to-base
Hong-Ou-Mandel dip also confirms the source bandwidth, with and a high
interference visibility of 97.1%. The entanglement is measured to violate the
Bell inequality by up to 18.5 standard deviations, with
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt S-parameter of 2.720. The quantum state tomography
further characterizes the entanglement, with fidelity F=95.71%. These unique

term that is used as a model of coarsening dynamics in laterally driven
phase-separating systems. In the absence of driving, it is known that solutions
to the standard CH equation are characterized by an initial stage of phase
separation into regions of one phase surrounded by the other phase (i.e.,
clusters or drops/holes or islands are obtained) followed by the coarsening
process, where the average size of the structures grows in time and their
number decreases. Moreover, two main coarsening modes have been identified in
the literature, namely, coarsening due to volume transfer and due to
translation. In the opposite limit of strong driving, the well-known
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation is recovered, which may produce complicated
chaotic spatio-temporal oscillations. The primary aim of the present work is to
perform a detailed and systematic investigation of the transitions in the
solutions of the convective CH (cCH) equation for a wide range of parameter
values, and, in particular, to understand in detail how the coarsening dynamics
is affected by an increase of the strength of the lateral driving force.
Considering symmetric two-drop states, we find that one of the coarsening modes
is stabilized at relatively weak driving, and the type of the remaining mode
may change as driving increases. Furthermore, there exist intervals in the
driving strength where coarsening is completely stabilized. In the intervals
where the symmetric two-drop states are unstable they can evolve, for example,
into one-drop states, two-drop states of broken symmetry or even time-periodic
two-drop states that consist of two traveling drops that periodically exchange
mass. We present detailed stability diagrams for symmetric two-drop states in
various parameter planes and corroborate our findings by selected time
simulations.

the use of traditional one-dimensional hydrostatic models. To this end, we
carried out \textit{ab initio} three-dimensional, hydrodynamical numerical

is free from the tuneable parameters typically adopted in traditional

analytical expressions whose ingredients are evaluated directly from the

estimate the theoretical oscillation amplitude and frequency of maximum power,
$\nu_{\max}$, for the Sun. We compare our numerical results with helioseismic

We consider the problem of navigating a UAV to a wireless signal source, e.g.,
a smartphone or watch owned by a victim. We assume that the source periodically
transmits RF signals to nearby wireless access points. Received signal strength
(RSS) at the UAV, which is a function of the UAV and source positions, is fed
to a Q-learning algorithm and the UAV is navigated to the vicinity of the
source. Unlike the traditional location-based Q-learning approach that uses the
GPS coordinates of the agent, our method uses the RSS to define the states and
rewards of the algorithm. It does not require any a priori information about
the environment. These, in turn, make it possible to use the UAVs in indoor SAR
operations. Two indoor scenarios with different dimensions are created using a
ray tracing software. Then, the corresponding heat maps that show the RSS at
each possible UAV location are extracted for more realistic analysis.
Performance of the RSS-based Q-learning algorithm is compared with the baseline

results show that the RSS-based Q-learning provides competitive performance

challenging to parallelise. This work proposes a massively parallel algorithm

thread, beginning somewhere in the middle of the input, should interpret a
certain symbol (e.g., whether to interpret a comma as a delimiter or as part of
a larger string enclosed in double-quotes). Instead of tailoring the approach
to a single format, we are able to perform a massively parallel FSM simulation,
which is more flexible and powerful, supporting more expressive parsing rules
with general applicability. Achieving a parsing rate of as much as 14.2 GB/s,
our experimental evaluation on a GPU with 3584 cores shows that the presented
approach is able to scale to thousands of cores and beyond. With an end-to-end

However, in real world, it is non-trivial to design such a reward function, and

up-type quark mass matrix is constructed by modular forms of weight $6$. Two
regions of $\tau$ are consistent with observed CKM matrix elements. The one is
close to $\tau=i$ and the other is in the larger ${\rm Im }[\tau]$. On the
other hand, lepton mass matrices work well only at nearby $\tau=i$, which
overlaps with the one of the quark sector, for the normal hierarchy of neutrino
masses. In the common $\tau$ region for quarks and leptons, the predicted sum
of neutrino masses is $87$--$120$meV taking account of its cosmological bound.
Since both the Dirac CP phase $\delta_{CP}^\ell$ and $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ are
correlated with the sum of neutrino masses, improving its cosmological bound
provides crucial tests for our scheme as well as the precise measurement of
$\sin^2\theta_{23}$ and $\delta_{CP}^\ell$. The effective neutrino mass of the

Despite a variety of methods developed for learning from crowds, a key
challenge remains unsolved: \emph{learning from crowds without knowing the
information structure among the crowds a priori, when some people of the crowds
make highly correlated mistakes and some of them label effortlessly (e.g.
randomly)}. We propose an information theoretic approach, Max-MIG, for joint
learning from crowds, with a common assumption: the crowdsourced labels and the
data are independent conditioning on the ground truth. Max-MIG simultaneously
aggregates the crowdsourced labels and learns an accurate data classifier.
Furthermore, we devise an accurate data-crowds forecaster that employs both the
data and the crowdsourced labels to forecast the ground truth. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that solves the aforementioned
challenge of learning from crowds. In addition to the theoretical validation,
we also empirically show that our algorithm achieves the new state-of-the-art
results in most settings, including the real-world data, and is the first
algorithm that is robust to various information structures. Codes are available

galaxy clusters at three slightly different redshifts in the northern and
southern sides of the supercluster by determining the redshifts of 55
red-sequence galaxies and 82 star-forming galaxies in total by the follow-up
spectroscopy with Subaru/FOCAS and Gemini-N/GMOS. This suggests that the

investigate stellar population of the red-sequence galaxies using 4000 A break

the large-scale structure at 50 Mpc scale formed at almost the same time, have
assembled into the denser regions, and then have evolved with different star

dynamics of symbol emergence in a multi-agent system through semiotic
communication. Semiotic communication is defined, in this study, as the
generation and interpretation of signs associated with the categories formed
through the agent's own sensory experience or by exchange of signs with other
agents. From the viewpoint of language evolution and symbol emergence,
organization of a symbol system in a multi-agent system is considered as a
bottom-up and dynamic process, where individual agents share the meaning of
signs and categorize sensory experience. A constructive computational model can
explain the mutual dependency of the two processes and has mathematical support
that guarantees a symbol system's emergence and sharing within the multi-agent
system. In this paper, we describe a new computational model that represents
symbol emergence in a two-agent system based on a probabilistic generative
model for multimodal categorization. It models semiotic communication via a
probabilistic rejection based on the receiver's own belief. We have found that
the dynamics by which cognitively independent agents create a symbol system
through their semiotic communication can be regarded as the inference process
of a hidden variable in an interpersonal multimodal categorizer, if we define
the rejection probability based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The
validity of the proposed model and algorithm for symbol emergence is also
verified in an experiment with two agents observing daily objects in the
real-world environment. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
reproduces the phenomena of symbol emergence, which does not require a teacher
who would know a pre-existing symbol system. Instead, the multi-agent system
can form and use a symbol system without having pre-existing categories.

representations from BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). We also find that training on
multiple source RC datasets leads to robust generalization and transfer, and
can reduce the cost of example collection for a new RC dataset. Following our

discovered Earth's first known natural geocentric object other than the Moon, a
few-meter diameter asteroid designated 2006 RH120. Despite significant
improvements in ground-based telescope and detector technology in the past
decade the asteroid surveys have not discovered another temporarily-captured
orbiter (TCO; colloquially known as minimoons). Within a few years the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will either begin to regularly detect TCOs or
force a re-analysis of the creation and dynamical evolution of small asteroids
in the inner solar system.
  The first studies of the provenance, properties, and dynamics of Earth's
minimoons suggested that there should be a steady state population with about
one 1- to 2-meter diameter captured objects at any time. That model was then
improved and extended to include the population of temporarily-captured flybys
(TCFs), objects that fail to make an entire revolution around Earth while
energetically bound to the Earth-Moon system. Several different techniques for
discovering TCOs have been considered but their small diameters, proximity, and
rapid motion make them challenging targets for existing ground-based optical,
meteor, and radar surveys.
  We expect that if the TCO population is confirmed, and new objects are
frequently discovered, they can provide new opportunities for 1) studying the
dynamics of the Earth-Moon system, 2) testing models of the production and
dynamical evolution of small asteroids from the asteroid belt, 3) rapid and
frequent low delta-v missions to multiple minimoons, and 4) evaluating in-situ
resource utilization techniques on asteroidal material.
  Here we review the past decade of minimoon studies in preparation for
capitalizing on the scientific and commercial opportunities of TCOs in the

generation of gravitational waves. By their nature, such gravitational waves
are complementary to those sourced at second-order by the very same scalar
perturbations responsible for the formation of the primordial black holes.

Crucially, style transfer must reliably retain original semantic content to be
actually deployable. We conduct a multifaceted evaluation of three
state-of-the-art encoder-decoder style transfer techniques, and show that all
fail at semantic retainment. In particular, they do not produce appropriate
paraphrases, but only retain original content in the trivial case of exactly
reproducing the text. To mitigate this problem we propose ParChoice: a
technique based on the combinatorial application of multiple paraphrasing
algorithms. ParChoice strongly outperforms the encoder-decoder baselines in
semantic retainment. Additionally, compared to baselines that achieve
non-negligible semantic retainment, ParChoice has superior style transfer
performance. We also apply ParChoice to multi-author style imitation (not
considered by prior work), where we achieve up to 75% imitation success among
five authors. Furthermore, when compared to two state-of-the-art rule-based
style transfer techniques, ParChoice has markedly better semantic retainment.
Combining ParChoice with the best performing rule-based baseline (Mutant-X)
also reaches the highest style transfer success on the Brennan-Greenstadt and
Extended-Brennan-Greenstadt corpora, with much less impact on original meaning
than when using the rule-based baseline techniques alone. Finally, we highlight
a critical problem that afflicts all current style transfer techniques: the
adversary can use the same technique for thwarting style transfer via
adversarial training. We show that adding randomness to style transfer helps to
mitigate the effectiveness of adversarial training.

evidence the catalytic role of dust surfaces using the thermal reaction CO2 +
2NH3 = NH4+NH2COO-, which is also a proxy of radical-radical reactions.
Nanometre-sized amorphous silicate and carbon grains produced in our laboratory
were used as grain analogues. Surface catalysis on grains accelerates the
kinetics of the reaction studied at a temperature of 80 K by a factor of up to
3 compared to the reaction occurring in the molecular solid. The evidence of
the catalytic effect of grain surfaces opens a door for experiments and
calculations on the surface formation of interstellar and circumstellar
molecules on dust. Ammonium carbamate on the surface of grains or released
intact into protostellar or protoplanetary disk phases can give start to a
network of prebiotic reactions. Therefore, there should be a great interest to
search for ammonium carbamate and its daughter molecule, carbamic acid, in
interstellar clouds, protostellar envelopes, and protoplanetary disks.

  and Adversarial Robustness",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ensemble approaches for uncertainty estimation have recently been applied to
the tasks of misclassification detection, out-of-distribution input detection
and adversarial attack detection. Prior Networks have been proposed as an
approach to efficiently \emph{emulate} an ensemble of models for classification
by parameterising a Dirichlet prior distribution over output distributions.
These models have been shown to outperform alternative ensemble approaches,
such as Monte-Carlo Dropout, on the task of out-of-distribution input
detection. However, scaling Prior Networks to complex datasets with many
classes is difficult using the training criteria originally proposed. This
paper makes two contributions. First, we show that the appropriate training
criterion for Prior Networks is the \emph{reverse} KL-divergence between
Dirichlet distributions. This addresses issues in the nature of the training
data target distributions, enabling prior networks to be successfully trained
on classification tasks with arbitrarily many classes, as well as improving
out-of-distribution detection performance. Second, taking advantage of this new
training criterion, this paper investigates using Prior Networks to detect
adversarial attacks and proposes a generalized form of adversarial training. It
is shown that the construction of successful \emph{adaptive} whitebox attacks,
which affect the prediction and evade detection, against Prior Networks trained
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using the proposed approach requires a greater amount
of computational effort than against networks defended using standard
adversarial training or MC-dropout.

$R_0\sim aN^{1/2}$, expands in the lateral direction as $R_{\parallel}\sim a
N^{\nu}(a/D)^{2\nu-1}$. Provided that the $\Theta$ condition is strictly
maintained throughout the compression, the well-known scaling exponent of
$\Theta$-chain in 2 dimensions, $\nu=4/7$, is anticipated in a perfect
confinement. However, numerics shows that upon increasing compression from
$R_0/D<1$ to $R_0/D\gg 1$, $\nu$ gradually deviates from $\nu=1/2$ and plateaus
at $\nu=3/4$, the exponent associated with the self-avoiding walk in two
dimensions. Using both theoretical considerations and numerics, we argue that
it is highly nontrivial to maintain the $\Theta$ condition under confinement
because of two major effects. First, as the dimension is reduced from 3 to 2
dimensions, the contributions of higher order virial terms, which can be
ignored in 3 dimensions at large $N$, become significant. Second and more
importantly, the geometrical confinement, which is regarded as an applied
external field, alters the second virial coefficient ($B_2$) changes from
$B_2=0$ ($\Theta$ condition) in free space to $B_2>0$ (good-solvent condition)

this distribution is used in machine learning to induce diversity in subset

propose a new algorithm which, given access to $\mathbf{L}$, samples exactly

sublinear in the size of $\mathbf{L}$, and (2) its sampling cost is

solvent. An abnormal response of polymer brushes, so-called co-nonsolvency, is
the phenomenon where the brush counter-intuitively collapses in a good solvent
mixture. In this work, we employed molecular dynamics simulations to
investigate the structural properties of the grafted polymers on the occurrence
of co-nonsolvency. Brushes with various grafting densities were considered to
study the effect of topological excluded volumes on the co-nonsolvency. We
found that the brush height follows a novel scaling behavior of the grafting
density $h \sim \sigma_{\text g}^{0.71}$ in the co-nonsolvent mixture. Using
the scaling exponent and Alexander-de Gennes theory, an analytic function that
predicts the monomer density was obtained. The many-chain effects in the
co-nonsolvent lead to the formation of both intermolecular and intramolecular
bridging structures. Increasing the grafting density entails lower looping
events occuring because of the intermolcular bridging, causing diverse
structural properties. We report how the average thickness, the polymer
orientation, and the looping probability varies as the grafting density
increases. Based on these observations, we constructed a phase diagram of the
polymer brush system using the average thickness and orientation as order
parameters. Our simulations and analytical results reveal the nature of
co-nonsolvency in polymer brushes in an explicit way and will help to provide
practical guidelines for applications such as drug delivery and sensor devices.

hydrophobic to hydrophilic SAM functionalizations, which is found related to
the stronger interfacial interaction between water molecules and more
hydrophilic SAM molecules. The stronger interaction increases the surface
friction and local viscosity, making water slip more difficult. More
hydrophilic functionalization also slows down the interfacial water relaxation
and leads to more pronounced water trapping inside the SAM layer, which both
impede water slip. The results from this work will provide useful insights to
the understanding of the water slip at functionalized surfaces and design

materials that minimize this energy loss. Oxynitrides with a layered perovskite
structure have the potential to combine the superior photocatalytic properties
of layered perovskite oxides with enhanced visible-light absorption caused by
the band gap narrowing due to less electronegative nitrogen ions. In this
paper, we study the OER on the (001) and (100) surfaces of the layered
oxynitride Sr$_2$TaO$_3$N using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to
obtain the OER free energy profiles and to determine the required
overpotentials at various sites on each surface. We find that the reconstructed
grooved (100) surface is most relevant for photocatalysis due to suitable
band-edge positions combined with a low overpotential and good carrier mobility
perpendicular to the surface.

These two characteristics introduce dependencies between the analysis time, at
which a series of studies is up for meta-analysis, and results within the
series. Dependencies introduce bias --- Accumulation Bias --- and invalidate
the sampling distribution assumed for p-value tests, thus inflating type-I
errors. But dependencies are also inevitable, since for science to accumulate
efficiently, new research needs to be informed by past results. Here, we
investigate various ways in which time influences error control in
meta-analysis testing. We introduce an Accumulation Bias Framework that allows
us to model a wide variety of practically occurring dependencies, including
study series accumulation, meta-analysis timing, and approaches to multiple
testing in living systematic reviews. The strength of this framework is that it
shows how all dependencies affect p-value-based tests in a similar manner. This
leads to two main conclusions. First, Accumulation Bias is inevitable, and even
if it can be approximated and accounted for, no valid p-value tests can be
constructed. Second, tests based on likelihood ratios withstand Accumulation
Bias: they provide bounds on error probabilities that remain valid despite the
bias. We leave the reader with a choice between two proposals to consider time
in error control: either treat individual (primary) studies and meta-analyses
as two separate worlds --- each with their own timing --- or integrate
individual studies in the meta-analysis world. Taking up likelihood ratios in
either approach allows for valid tests that relate well to the accumulating
nature of scientific knowledge. Likelihood ratios can be interpreted as betting
profits, earned in previous studies and invested in new ones, while the
meta-analyst is allowed to cash out at any time and advise against future
studies.

super-diffusion leads to an increase in the spectral dimension at short
diffusion times, in contrast to other approaches to quantum gravity. In the
current work, by using a temporal localisation in the causal set, the number of

causal sets obtained from $d=3$ Minkowski spacetime, we find that for a flat
spatial hypersurface, the spectral dimension agrees with the Hausdorff
dimension at intermediate scales, but shows clear indications of dimensional
reduction at small scales, i.e., in the ultraviolet. The latter is a direct
consequence of ``discrete asymptotic silence'' at small scales in causal sets.

of applications which will be executed on a shared platform where the mix of
concurrently executed applications may change dynamically at run time. For each
individual application, an off-line Design Space Exploration (DSE) is performed
to compute several mapping alternatives on the platform, offering
Pareto-optimal trade-offs in terms of real-time guarantees, resource usage,
etc. At run time, one mapping is then chosen to launch the application on
demand. In this context, to enable an independent analysis of each individual
application at design time, so-called inter-application isolation schemes are
applied which specify temporal or spatial isolation policies between
applications. S.o.t.a. composable many-core systems are developed based on a
fixed isolation scheme that is exclusively applied to every resource in every
mapping of every application and use a timing analysis tailored to that
isolation scheme to derive timing guarantees for each mapping. A fixed
isolation scheme, however, heavily restricts the explored space of solutions
and can, therefore, lead to suboptimality. Lifting this restriction
necessitates a timing analysis that is applicable to mappings with an arbitrary
mix of isolation schemes on different resources. To address this issue, we
present an isolation-aware timing analysis that unlike existing analyses can
handle multiple isolation schemes in combination within one mapping and
delivers safe yet tight timing bounds by identifying and excluding interference
scenarios that can never happen under the given combination of isolation
schemes. Based on the timing analysis, we present a DSE which explores the
choices of isolation scheme per resource within each mapping. Experimental
results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach over approaches
based on a fixed isolation scheme.

were experimentally observed in non-collinear AFMs, and the presence of the
equivalent to the ferromagnetic spin transfer torque via spin polarized

interpretation of the rich physical phenomena observed in non-collinear
antiferromagnets is challenging, since the microscopic spin arrangement, the
magnetic domain distribution, and the domain orientations have proven
notoriously difficult to access experimentally. This is all the more
problematic, as imaging and writing magnetic domains is of central importance

confirm the spin transfer torque acting on non-collinear domain walls and

overall baryon budget in galaxies. Literature models predict transitions of the
state of the gaseous halo between cold and hot accretion, winds, fountains and
hydrostatic halos at certain galaxy masses. Since luminosities of radio AGN are
sensitive to halo densities, any significant transition would be expected to
show up in the radio luminosities of large samples of galaxies. The Low
Frequency Array (LOFAR) Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) has indeed identified a
galaxy stellar mass scale, $10^{11} M_\odot$ , above which the radio
luminosities increase disproportionately. Here, we investigate, if radio
luminosities of galaxies, especially the marked rise at galaxy masses around
$10^{11} M_\odot$, can be explained with standard assumptions on jet powers,
scaling between black hole-mass and galaxy mass and gaseous halos. We developed
models for the radio luminosity of radio AGN in halos under infall, galactic
wind and hydrostatic conditions based on observational data and theoretical
constraints, and compared it to LoTSS data for a large sample of galaxies in
the mass rangebetween $10^{8.5} M_\odot$ and $10^{12} M_\odot$. Assuming the
same characteristic upper limit to jet powers as is known from high galaxy
masses to hold at all masses, we find that the maximum radio luminosities for
the hydrostatic gas halos fit well with the upper envelope of the distribution
of the LOFAR data. The marked rise in radio luminosity at $10^{11} M_\odot$ is
matched in our model, and is related to significant change in halo gas density
around this galaxy mass, which is a consequence of the lower cooling rates at
higher virial temperature. Wind and infall models overpredict the radio
luminosities at small galaxy masses and have no particular steepening of the
run of the radio luminosities predicted at any galaxy mass. [...]

disconnection structure and mechanism. Disconnections are line defects that lie
solely within a GB and are characterized by both a Burgers vector and a step
height, as set by the GB bicrystallography. Multiple disconnection modes can
nucleate, as determined by their formation energy barriers and temperature, and
move along the GB under different kinds of competing driving forces including
shear stress and chemical potential jumps across the GBs. We present a
continuum model in two dimensions for GB migration where the GB migrates via
the thermally-activated nucleation and kinetically-driven motion of
disconnections. We perform continuum numerical simulations for investigating
the GB migration behavior in single and multi-mode disconnection limits in both
a bicrystal (under two types of boundary conditions) and for a finite-length GB
with pinned ends. The results clearly demonstrate the significance of including
the coupling and competing between different disconnection modes and driving
forces for describing the complex and diverse phenomena of GB migration within
polycyrstalline microstructures.

low-power wide-area (LPWA) networks with regards to coexisting radio modules.
We adopt long range (LoRa) radio technique as an example of the network of
focus even though our analysis can be easily extended to other situations. We
exploit a new topology to model the network, where the node locations of LoRa
follow a Poisson cluster process (PCP) while other coexisting radio modules
follow a Poisson point process (PPP). Unlike most of the performance analysis
based on stochastic geometry, we take noise into consideration. More
specifically, two models, with a fixed and a random number of active LoRa nodes
in each cluster, respectively, are considered. To obtain insights, both the
exact and simple approximated expressions for coverage probability are derived.
Based on them, area spectral efficiency and energy efficiency are obtained.
From our analysis, we show how the performance of LPWA networks can be enhanced
through adjusting the density of LoRa nodes around each LoRa receiver.
Moreover, the simulation results unveil that the optimal number of active LoRa
nodes in each cluster exists to maximize the area spectral efficiency.

we study quantitative hyperproperties, which we define as hyperproperties that
express a bound on the number of traces that may appear in a certain relation.
For example, quantitative non-interference limits the amount of information
about certain secret inputs that is leaked through the observable outputs of a
system. Quantitative non-interference thus bounds the number of traces that
have the same observable input but different observable output. We study
quantitative hyperproperties in the setting of HyperLTL, a temporal logic for
hyperproperties. We show that, while quantitative hyperproperties can be
expressed in HyperLTL, the running time of the HyperLTL model checking
algorithm is, depending on the type of property, exponential or even doubly
exponential in the quantitative bound. We improve this complexity with a new
model checking algorithm based on model-counting. The new algorithm needs only
logarithmic space in the bound and therefore improves, depending on the
property, exponentially or even doubly exponentially over the model checking
algorithm of HyperLTL. In the worst case, the new algorithm needs polynomial
space in the size of the system. Our Max#Sat-based prototype implementation
demonstrates, however, that the counting approach is viable on systems with
nontrivial quantitative information flow requirements such as a passcode

principal aims of this investigation, regard the extension of the isotropic
Durgapal-Fuloria model within the context of charged isotropic
$f(R,\mathcal{T})$ solutions. The second main goal of this work is to apply the
gravitational decoupling via a minimal geometric deformation (MGD) scheme in
$f(R,\mathcal{T})$ gravity. Finally, the third one is to derive an anisotropic
version of the charged isotropic model previously obtained by applying
gravitational decoupling technology. This MGD approach splits the system of
equations into two separate sets, one corresponding with the f(R,$\mathcal{T}$)
gravity system and another corresponding to the anisotropic sector governed by
the extra source $\theta_{\mu\nu}$.To address this task we have considered some
ingredients: I) the f(R,$\mathcal{T}$) model corresponds to a linear functional
of the Ricci's scalar and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor
$\mathcal{T}$, specifically $ f(R,\mathcal{T}) =R+2\chi\mathcal{T}$, being
$\chi$ a running coupling constant. II) The matter distribution is taken to be
an isotropic fluid one, III) the Lagrangian matter $\mathcal{L}_{m}$
corresponds to the negative isotropic pressure \i.e, $-p$ and IV) in order to
solve the $\theta$-sector, a suitable form for the decoupler function $f(r)$
has been imposed, respecting all the physical and mathematical requirements.
  Finally, to check and contrast our model an exhaustive mathematical, physical
and graphical analysis is performed in order to show all the properties that
characterize the compact structure. It is worth mentioning that when $\chi=0$
Einstein's gravity theory results are recovered.

geometry to characterize and understand the structure of many-particle states.
For mean-field states, the quantum geometry has been defined and analysed in
terms of the quantum distances between two points in the space of single
particle spectral parameters (the Brillioun zone for periodic systems) and the
geometric phase associated with any loop in this space. These definitions are
in terms of single-particle wavefunctions. In recent work, we had proposed a
formalism to define quantum distances between two points in the spectral
parameter space for any correlated many-body state. In this paper we argue
that, for correlated states, the application of the theory of optimal transport
to analyse the geometry is a powerful approach. This technique enables us to
define geometric quantities which are averaged over the entire spectral
parameter space. We present explicit results for a well studied model, the one

interacting with a field in a thermal state. We work in an open system

The long-time interaction between the detector and the field is modelled with
the aid of a one-parameter family of switching functions that turn on and off
the interaction Hamiltonian between the two subsystems, such that the long-time
interaction limit is reached as the family parameter goes to infinity. In such
limit, we show that if the field is in a Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) state and
the detector is stationary with respect to the notion of positive frequency of
the field, in the Born-Markov approximation, the asymptotic state of the
detector is a Gibbs state at the KMS temperature. We then relax the KMS
condition for the field state, and require only that a frequency-dependent
version of the detailed balance condition for the Wightman function pulled back
to the detector worldline hold, in the sense that the inverse temperature
appearing in the detailed balance relation need not be constant. In this
setting, we show that the late-time asymptotic state of the detector has the
form of a thermal density matrix, but with a frequency-dependent temperature.
We present examples of these results, which include the classical Unruh effect
and idealised Hawking radiation (for fields in the HHI state), and also the
study of the late-time behaviour of detectors following stationary ""cusped"" and
circular motions in Minkowski space interacting with a massless Klein-Gordon

frequency-dependent, effective temperature for the asymptotic late-time

However, many NAS methods, which optimize the search process in a discrete

constructs a differentiable search space and then optimizes it by gradient
descent, can obtain high-performance architecture and reduces the search time
to several days. However, DARTS is still slow as it updates an ensemble of all
operations and keeps only one after convergence. Besides, DARTS can converge to
inferior architectures due to the strong correlation among operations. In this
paper, we propose a new differentiable Neural Architecture Search method based
on Proximal gradient descent (denoted as NASP). Different from DARTS, NASP
reformulates the search process as an optimization problem with a constraint
that only one operation is allowed to be updated during forward and backward

permits the simple introduction of thermal gauges in a way similar to the
'ordinary' Feynman propagator and, therefore, the gauge invariance can be
proved for all the considered effects. Moreover, contrary to the 'standard'
form of thermal photon propagator, the Hadamard expression has a well defined
analytical properties. However, this thermal photon propagator contains the
divergent contribution which requires the introduction of regularization
procedure within the framework of constructed theory. The method of
regularization in conjunction with the physical interpretation is given in the
paper. Correctness of regularization procedure is confirmed also by the gauge
invariance of final results and coincidence of the results (on the example of
self-energy correction) for two different forms of photon propagator. On the
basis of constructed theory the thermal Coulomb potential and its asymptotics
at the large distances are found. Finally, we discuss in details the thermal
effects of lowest order in the fine structure constant and temperature. Such
effects are presented by the thermal one-photon exchange between bound electron
and nucleus, thermal one-loop self-energy, thermal vacuum polarization, recoil
corrections and correction on the finite size of the nucleus. Introduction of
the regularization allows us do not apply the renormalization procedure. To
confirm this we describe also the thermal vertex (with one, two and three
vertices) corrections within the adiabatic $S$-matrix formalism. Finally, the
influence of thermal effects on the determination of proton radius and Rydberg
constant is discussed in the paper.

Kitaev materials - spin-orbit entangled Mott insulators with strong

materials the local spin-orbital j=1/2 moments typically show long-range
magnetic order at low temperature, thus defying the formation of a spin-liquid
ground state. Using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), we here report
on a proximate spin liquid regime with clear fingerprints of Kitaev physics in
the magnetic excitations of the honeycomb iridates alpha-Li2IrO3 and Na2IrO3.
We observe a broad continuum of magnetic excitations that persists up to at
least 300K, more than an order of magnitude larger than the magnetic ordering
temperatures. We prove the magnetic character of this continuum by an analysis
of the resonance behavior. RIXS measurements of the dynamical structure factor
for energies within the continuum show that dynamical spin-spin correlations
are restricted to nearest neighbors. Notably, these spectroscopic observations
are also present in the magnetically ordered state for excitation energies
above the conventional magnon excitations. Phenomenologically, our data agree
with inelastic neutron scattering results on the related honeycomb compound
RuCl3, establishing a common ground for a proximate Kitaev spin-liquid regime
in these materials.

red clump stars as standard candles in some lines of sight crossing the
off-plane bulge. However, some doubts have been cast on whether the two peaks
in star counts along the line of sight really represent a double peak in the
density distribution, or whether there is something wrong with the assumption
of a unique constant absolute magnitude for all of these stars.
  AIMS. With the advent of Gaia-DR2 parallaxes in combination with
near-infrared VISTA-VVV data, we are able to check which of the hypotheses is
correct.
  METHODS. We calculated the median absolute magnitude $M_K$ corresponding to
both peaks of putative red clumps in seven lines of sight with the lowest
extinction in the interesting coordinates' range.
  RESULTS. The difference between the absolute magnitude of the bright and the
faint peak is $\Delta M_K\approx 0.4$. The selected stars in both peaks cannot
be represented by the same red clump giants with constant $M_K\approx -1.6$.
  CONCLUSIONS. The hypothesis that the bulge contains an X-shape is based on
the assumption that the faint and bright peaks of the density distribution
towards the bulge are dominated by standard red clump stars. However, we show
that both the faint and bright peaks cannot be dominated by standard red clump
stars simultaneously.

amends descriptor objects used in existing lock-free helping schemes with

strategy that performs social deep pairwise learning. Firstly, we design a
ranking loss function incorporating multiple ranking criteria based on the

curvature $k$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (a wire). For a class of curves, that we call
nice wires, the wire billiard map is area preserving twist map of the cylinder.
In this paper we are investigating whether the basic features of conventional
planar billiards extend to this more general situation. In particular, we
extend Lazutkin's KAM result, as well as Mather's converse KAM result, to wire
billiards. We address the notion of caustics: for wire billiards, it
corresponds to striction curve of the ruled surface spanned by the chords of
the invariant curve. If the ruled surface is developable this is a genuine
caustic. We found remarkable examples of the wires which are closed orbits of
1-parameter subgroup of $SO(n)$. These wire billiards are totally integrable.
Using the theory of interpolating Hamiltonians, we prove that the distribution
of impact points of the wire becomes uniform with respect to the measure
$k^{2/3} dx$ (where $x$ is the arc length parameter), as the length of the
chords tends to zero. Applying this result, we prove that the billiard
transformation in an ellipsoid commutes with the reparameterized geodesic flow
on a confocal ellipsoid: the speed of the foot point of the line tangent to a
geodesic equals $k^{-2/3}$, where $k$ is the curvature of the geodesic in the
ambient space. We also discuss perspectives and open problems of this new class

formed in the outer Solar System beyond Jupiter's orbit, despite being
currently located in the main asteroid belt. The ambient temperature under
which asteroids formed is a crucial diagnostic to pinpoint the original
location of asteroids and is potentially determined by the abundance of
volatiles they contain. In particular, abundances and 13C/12C ratios of
carbonates in meteorites record the abundances of carbon-bearing volatile
species in their parent asteroids. However, the sources of carbon for these

meteorite contains abundant carbonates with consistently high 13C/12C ratios.
The high abundance of 13C-rich carbonates in Tagish Lake excludes organic
matter as their main carbon source. Therefore, the Tagish Lake parent body,
presumably a D-type asteroid, must have accreted a large amount of 13C-rich CO2
ice. The estimated 13C/12C and CO2/H2O ratios of ice in Tagish Lake are similar
to those of cometary ice. Thus, we infer that at least some D-type asteroids
formed in the cold outer Solar System and were subsequently transported into
the inner Solar System owing to an orbital instability of the giant planets.

continuously increasing entropy. However, over dynamical time-scales the
coarse-grained entropy generally increases, with small oscillations occurring.
The lack of substantive differences between the entropies in test-particle and

derive a total background rate of (0.84$\pm$0.02) mHz above 1000 keV. The
comparison of data samples with and without the use of the radon abatement

S^{p}_{\alpha,\mathrm{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^{2n + 1})$. We show that the
localisation can be omitted if one only cares for Sobolev regularity in the
vertical direction: the horizontal Sobolev space
$S_{2\alpha}^{p}(\mathbb{H}^{n})$ is continuously contained in the vertical
Sobolev space $V^{p}_{\alpha}(\mathbb{H}^{n})$.
  Our search for the sharper result was motivated by the following two
applications. First, combined with a short additional argument, it implies that
bounded Lipschitz functions on $\mathbb{H}^{n}$ have a $\tfrac{1}{2}$-order
vertical derivative in $\mathrm{BMO}(\mathbb{H}^{n})$. Second, it yields a
fractional order generalisation of the (non-endpoint) vertical versus
horizontal Poincar\'e inequalities of V. Lafforgue and A. Naor.

for convergent recurrent neural networks, i.e. RNNs that are fed by a static
input x and settle to a steady state. Training convergent RNNs consists in
adjusting the weights until the steady state of output neurons coincides with a
target y. Convergent RNNs can also be trained with the more conventional
Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) algorithm. In its original formulation EP
was described in the case of real-time neuronal dynamics, which is
computationally costly. In this work, we introduce a discrete-time version of
EP with simplified equations and with reduced simulation time, bringing EP
closer to practical machine learning tasks. We first prove theoretically, as
well as numerically that the neural and weight updates of EP, computed by
forward-time dynamics, are step-by-step equal to the ones obtained by BPTT,
with gradients computed backward in time. The equality is strict when the
transition function of the dynamics derives from a primitive function and the
steady state is maintained long enough. We then show for more standard
discrete-time neural network dynamics that the same property is approximately
respected and we subsequently demonstrate training with EP with equivalent
performance to BPTT. In particular, we define the first convolutional
architecture trained with EP achieving ~ 1% test error on MNIST, which is the
lowest error reported with EP. These results can guide the development of deep
neural networks trained with EP.

predict the existence of bosons that could constitute the dark matter (DM)

matter the velocity distribution of the bosonic DM field defines a
characteristic coherence time $\tau_c$. Until recently, laboratory experiments
searching for bosonic DM fields have been in the regime where the measurement
time $T$ significantly exceeds $\tau_c$, so null results have been interpreted
as constraints on the coupling of bosonic DM to standard model particles with a
bosonic DM field amplitude $\Phi_0$ fixed by the average local DM density.
However, motivated by new theoretical developments, a number of recent searches
probe the regime where $T\ll\tau_c$. Here we show that experiments operating in

inferring constraints on the coupling strength of bosonic DM to standard model
particles. Instead, in order to interpret laboratory measurements (even in the
event of a discovery), it is necessary to account for the stochastic nature of
such a virialized ultralight field (VULF). The constraints inferred from
several previous null experiments searching for ultralight bosonic DM were
overestimated by factors ranging from 3 to 10 depending on experimental
details, model assumptions, and choice of inference framework.

$N$ times for a dataset of size $N$. Previous work has shown that
approximations to LOOCV can be both fast and accurate -- when the unknown

naive in this ontology. We also show that our model is flexible both in how it
adapts to data manifolds and in terms of the operations that are available for

is easy to collect, as typically discussed in the learning-to-rank scenario,

empirically show that for linear models the proposed methods are comparable to
ordinary supervised regression with labeled data.

properties for the neutron $^{3}P_{2}$ superfluid. First, the phase on the
surface can be different from that of the bulk, and symmetry restoration or
breaking occurs in general on the surface. Second, the distribution of the
surface energy density has an anisotropy depending on the polar angle in the
sphere, which may lead to the deformation of the geometrical shape of the
surface. Third, the order parameter manifold induced on the surface, which is
described by two-dimensional vector fields induced on the surface from the
condensates, allows topological defects (vortices) on the surface, and there
must exist such defects even in the ground state thanks to the
Poincar\'{e}-Hopf theorem: although the numbers of the vortices and
antivortices depend on the bulk phases, the difference between them is
topologically invariant (the Euler number $\chi=2$) irrespective of the bulk
phases. These vortices, which are not extended to the bulk, are called boojums
in the context of liquid crystals and helium-3 superfluids. The surface

  on Machine Learning Models",,,,,"stat.AP cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite the increasing importance of forecasts of renewable energy, current
planning studies only address a general estimate of the forecast quality to be
expected and selected forecast horizons.
  However, these estimates allow only a limited and highly uncertain use in the
planning of electric power distribution. More reliable planning processes
require considerably more information about future forecast quality.
  In this article, we present an in-depth analysis and comparison of
influencing factors regarding uncertainty in wind and photovoltaic power
forecasts, based on four different machine learning (ML) models.
  In our analysis, we found substantial differences in uncertainty depending on
ML models, data coverage, and seasonal patterns that have to be considered in
future planning studies.

formation of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
In this letter, we present the first measurement of inclusive $J/\psi$
production at mid-rapidity through the dimuon decay channel in Au+Au collisions
at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV with the STAR experiment. These measurements
became possible after the installation of the Muon Telescope Detector was
completed in 2014. The $J/\psi$ yields are measured in a wide transverse
momentum ($p_{\rm{T}}$) range of 0.15 GeV/$c$ to 12 GeV/$c$ from central to
peripheral collisions. They extend the kinematic reach of previous measurements
at RHIC with improved precision. In the 0-10% most central collisions, the
$J/\psi$ yield is suppressed by a factor of approximately 3 for $p_{\rm{T}}>5$
GeV/$c$ relative to that in p+p collisions scaled by the number of binary
nucleon-nucleon collisions. The $J/\psi$ nuclear modification factor displays
little dependence on $p_{\rm{T}}$ in all centrality bins. Model calculations
can qualitatively describe the data, providing further evidence for the
color-screening effect experienced by $J/\psi$ mesons in the QGP.

of a few kilometers (rather than from a surface of infinitesimal width). We
study the effect of integration (averaging) over such an extended emission
region on collective oscillations. The averaging leads to additional
suppression of the correlation (off-diagonal element of the density matrix) by
a factor $ \sim 1/r_{\rm eff} V_e \sim 10^{-10}$, where $V_e$ is the matter
potential. This factor enters the initial condition for further collective
oscillations and, consequently, leads to a delay of the strong flavour
transitions. We justify and quantify this picture using a simple example of
collective effects in two intersecting fluxes. We have derived the evolution
equation for the density matrix elements integrated over the emission region
and solved it both numerically and analytically. For the analytic solution we
have used linearized equations. We show that the delay of the development of
the instability and the collective oscillations depends on the suppression
factor due to the averaging (integration) logarithmically. If the instability
develops inside the production region, the integration leads not only to a
delay but also to a modification of the exponential grow.

quantum dissipative dynamics into structured environments. In essence, it aims
to mimic the original problem by means of an 'augmented system', which includes
a suitably chosen collective environmental coordinate---the 'reaction
coordinate'. This composite then couples to a simpler 'residual reservoir' with
short-lived correlations. If, in addition, the residual coupling is weak, a
simple quantum master equation can be rigorously applied to the augmented
system, and the solution of the original problem just follows from tracing out
the reaction coordinate. But, what if the residual dissipation is strong? Here
we consider an exactly solvable model for heat transport---a two-node linear
""quantum wire"" connecting two baths at different temperatures. We allow for a
structured spectral density at the interface with one of the reservoirs and
perform the reaction-coordinate mapping, writing a perturbative master equation
for the augmented system. We find that: (a) strikingly, the stationary state of
the original problem can be reproduced accurately by a weak-coupling treatment
even when the residual dissipation on the augmented system is very strong; (b)
the agreement holds throughout the entire dynamics under large residual
dissipation in the overdamped regime; (c) and that such master equation can
grossly overestimate the stationary heat current across the wire, even when its
non-equilibrium steady state is captured faithfully. These observations can be
crucial when using the reaction-coordinate mapping to study the largely
unexplored strong-coupling regime in quantum thermodynamics.

programming practice. However, some object-oriented design patterns are
distorted or overly complicated because of the lack of supporting programming
language constructs or mechanisms. For this paper, we have analyzed several
published design patterns looking for idiomatic ways of working around
constraints of the implementation language. From this analysis, we lay a
groundwork of general-purpose language constructs and mechanisms that, if
provided by a statically typed, object-oriented language, would better support
the implementation of design patterns and, transitively, benefit the
construction of many real systems. In particular, our catalog of language
constructs includes subtyping separate from inheritance, lexically scoped
closure objects independent of classes, and multimethod dispatch. The proposed
constructs and mechanisms are not radically new, but rather are adopted from a
variety of languages and programming language research and combined in a new,
orthogonal manner. We argue that by describing design patterns in terms of the
proposed constructs and mechanisms, pattern descriptions become simpler and,
therefore, accessible to a larger number of language communities. Constructs
and mechanisms lacking in a particular language can be implemented using
paradigmatic idioms.

is the sum of many local submodular functions and each agent in the network has
access to one function in the sum only. In this \emph{distributed} set-up, in

greedy algorithm which is run only until the selected block is computed, thus
resulting in a reduced computational burden. The proposed algorithm is shown to
converge in expected value to the optimal cost of the problem, and an
approximate solution to the submodular problem is retrieved by a thresholding
operation. As an application, we consider a distributed image segmentation

While agents cannot segment the entire image on their own, they correctly
complete the task by cooperating through the proposed distributed algorithm.

nodes return erroneous values. For an additive random Gaussian error model, we
show that for all $t < N-K$, errors can be corrected with probability 1.
Further, numerical results show that in the presence of additive errors, when
$L$ Reed-Solomon codes are collaboratively decoded, the numerical stability in
recovering the error locator polynomial improves with increasing $L$.

agents are jointly trained to solve tasks requiring communication through a

that, under common training procedures, the emergent languages are subject to
an entropy minimization pressure that has also been detected in human language,
whereby the mutual information between the communicating agent's inputs and the
messages is minimized, within the range afforded by the need for successful
communication. That is, emergent languages are (nearly) as simple as the task

increase communication channel discreteness. Further, we observe that stronger
discrete-channel-driven entropy minimization leads to representations with
increased robustness to overfitting and adversarial attacks. We conclude by
discussing the implications of our findings for the study of natural and

magnetic field are carried out up to a Chandrasekhar number of $Q=10^8$ over a
broad range of Rayleigh numbers $Ra$. Three magnetoconvection regimes are
identified: two of the regimes are magnetically-constrained in the sense that a
leading-order balance exists between the Lorentz and buoyancy forces, whereas
the third regime is characterized by unbalanced dynamics that is similar to
non-magnetic convection. Each regime is distinguished by flow morphology,
momentum and heat equation balances, and heat transport behavior. One of the
magnetically-constrained regimes appears to represent an `ultimate'
magnetoconvection regime in the dual limit of asymptotically-large buoyancy
forcing and magnetic field strength; this regime is characterized by an
interconnected network of anisotropic, spatially-localized fluid columns
aligned with the direction of the imposed magnetic field that remain
quasi-laminar despite having large flow speeds. As for non-magnetic convection,
heat transport is controlled primarily by the thermal boundary layer.
Empirically, the scaling of the heat transport and flow speeds with $Ra$ appear
to be independent of the thermal Prandtl number within the
magnetically-constrained, high-$Q$ regimes.

access to their gradient and (ii) stochastic settings with an unbiased

Different than other works in this vein, we also study the effects of
non-uniform learning rates on the learning dynamics and convergence rates. We

emission fully explained by thermal emission from the colliding winds in the
208-d orbit. We report on a significant deviation of the X-ray flux with
respect to the 1/D trend (expected for adiabatic shocked winds) close to
periastron passage. The absence of a drop in post-shock plasma temperature
close to periastron suggests this break in trend cannot be explained in terms
of reduced pre-shock velocities in this part of the orbit. Finally, NuSTAR data
reveal a lack of hard X-ray emission (above 10.0 keV) above the background
level. Upper limits on a putative non-thermal emission strongly suggest that
the sensitivity of present hard X-ray observatories is not sufficient to detect
non-thermal emission from massive binaries above 10 keV, unless the wind
kinetic power is large enough to significantly feed particle acceleration in
the wind-wind interaction.

direction towards ""where"" to sample in the design variable space. This paper
thus introduces the capability to identify optimum location to add new samples.
The location of the infill points is decided by integrating a Gaussian
Process-based criteria (""q-EI""), adopted from Bayesian optimization. The
consideration of a penalization term to mitigate interaction among samples (in
a batch) is crucial to effective integration of the q-EI criteria into AMR. The
new AMR method, called AMR with Penalized Batch Bayesian Sampling (AMR-PBS) is
tested on benchmark functions, demonstrating better performance compared to
Bayesian EGO. In addition, it is successfully applied to design surface riblets
for bio-inspired passive flow control (where high-fidelity samples are given by
costly RANS CFD simulations), leading to a 10% drag reduction over the

is based on analyzing the time-dependent (dynamic) response of the material
excited by an acoustic signal. A case study is presented consisting of
experimental measurements and their mathematical analysis. The decisive
parameters (wave speed and damping coefficient) of a mathematical model of the
acoustic wave are calibrated by comparing the measurement data with the
numerically evaluated exact solution predicted by the mathematical model. The
calibration is done both deterministically by minimizing the square error over
time and stochastically by a Bayesian approach, implemented through the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The resulting posterior distribution of the
parameters can be used to construct a Bayesian test for damage.

addition, a parameter quantization (PQ) technique was applied to reduce the

Because the techniques are derived based on different concepts, the PP and PQ
can be integrated to provide even more compact SE models. The experimental
results show that the PP and PQ techniques produce a compacted SE model with a
size of only 10.03% compared to that of the original model, resulting in minor
performance losses of 1.43% (from 0.70 to 0.69) for STOI and 3.24% (from 1.85

operational numerical weather predictions centers worldwide.This paper
implements a new method for parallelizing incremental 4D-Var, the Randomized
Incremental Optimal Technique (RIOT), which replaces the traditional sequential
conjugate gradient (CG) iterations in the inner-loop of the minimization with
fully parallel randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) of the
preconditioned Hessian of the cost function. RIOT is tested using the standard
Lorenz-96 model (L-96) as well as two realistic high-dimensional atmospheric
source inversion problems based on aircraft observations of black carbon
concentrations. A new outer-loop preconditioning technique tailored to RSVD was
introduced to improve convergence stability and performance. Results obtained
with the L-96 system show that the performance improvement from RIOT compared
to standard CG algorithms increases significantly with non-linearities.
Overall, in the realistic black carbon source inversion experiments, RIOT
reduces the wall-time of the 4D-Var minimization by a factor 2-3, at the cost
of a factor 4-10 increase in energy cost due to the large number of parallel
cores used. Furthermore, RIOT enables reduction of the wall-time computation of
the analysis error covariance matrix by a factor 40 compared to a standard
iterative Lanczos approach. Finally, as evidenced in this study, implementation
of RIOT in an operational numerical weather prediction system will require a
better understanding of its convergence properties as a function of the Hessian
characteristics and, in particular, the degree of freedom for signal (DOFs) of
the inverse problem.

analyzing could provide an indication of conductivity change within a

development of a numerically stable and efficiency-finite element scheme that
performs well at low frequency and does not require a large number of degrees
of freedom. Here, a custom finite element method (FEM) solver based on edge
elements is proposed using the weakly coupled theory, which separates the
solution into two steps. First, the background field (the magnetic vector
potential on each edge) is calculated and stored. Then, the electric scalar
potential on each node is obtained by FEM based on Galerkin formulations.
Consequently, the electric field and eddy current distribution in the object
can be obtained. This solver is more efficient than typical commercial solvers
since it reduces the vector eddy current equation to a scalar one, and reduces
the meshing domain to just the eddy current region. It can therefore tackle
complex eddy current calculations for models with much larger numbers of
elements, such as those encountered in eddy current computation in biological
tissues. An example is presented with a realistic human brain mesh of 2 million
elements. In addition, with this solver, the equivalent magnetic field induced
from the excitation coil is applied, and therefore there is no need to mesh the
excitation coil. In combination, these significantly increase the efficiency of
the solver.

computational cost of computer simulation. SVR assumes the input parameters
have equal sample sizes, but unequal sample sizes are often encountered in
engineering practices. To solve this issue, a new prediction approach based on
SVR, namely as high-low-level SVR approach (HL-SVR) is proposed for data
modeling of input parameters of unequal sample sizes in this paper. The
proposed approach is consisted of low-level SVR models for the input parameters
of larger sample sizes and high-level SVR model for the input parameters of
smaller sample sizes. For each training point of the input parameters of
smaller sample sizes, one low-level SVR model is built based on its
corresponding input parameters of larger sample sizes and their responses of
interest. The high-level SVR model is built based on the obtained responses
from the low-level SVR models and the input parameters of smaller sample sizes.
Several numerical examples are used to validate the performance of HL-SVR. The
experimental results indicate that HL-SVR can produce more accurate prediction
results than conventional SVR. The proposed approach is applied on the stress
analysis of dental implant, which the structural parameters have massive
samples but the material of implant can only be selected from several Ti and
its alloys. The prediction performance of the proposed approach is much better
than the conventional SVR. The proposed approach can be used for the design,

extends three approaches to depth-limited solving that previously existed in
extensive-form games and multiagent reinforcement learning but were not known
to be compatible. A key ingredient of these depth-limited games are value
functions. Focusing on two-player zero-sum imperfect-information games, we show
how to obtain optimal value functions and prove that public information
provides both necessary and sufficient context for computing them. We provide a
domain-independent encoding of the domains that allows for approximating value
functions even by simple feed-forward neural networks, which are then able to
generalize to unseen parts of the game. We use the resulting value network to
implement a depth-limited version of counterfactual regret minimization. In
three distinct domains, we show that the algorithm's exploitability is roughly
linearly dependent on the value network's quality and that it is not difficult

large-scale employment opportunities to artisans in rural and underprivileged
communities. However, in this era of globalization, diverse modern designs have
rendered traditional designs old and monotonous, causing an alarming decline of
handicraft sales. For this age-old industry to survive the global competition,
it is imperative to integrate contemporary designs with Indian handicrafts. In
this paper, we use novel AI techniques to generate contemporary designs for two
popular Indian handicrafts - Ikat and Block Print. These techniques were
successfully employed by communities across India to manufacture and sell
products with greater appeal and revenue. The designs are evaluated to be
significantly more likeable and marketable than the current designs used by
artisans.

introduce several important cognitive functions of the brain. Brain cognitive
functions are the mental processes that allow us to receive, select, store,
transform, develop, and recover information that we've received from external
stimuli. This process allows us to understand and to relate to the world more
effectively. Cognitive functions are brain-based skills we need to carry out
any task from the simplest to the most complex. They are related with the
mechanisms of how we learn, remember, problem-solve, and pay attention, etc. To
be more specific, in this paper, we will talk about the perception, attention
and memory functions of the human brain. Several other brain cognitive
functions, e.g., arousal, decision making, natural language, motor
coordination, planning, problem solving and thinking, will be added to this
paper in the later versions, respectively. Many of the materials used in this
paper are from wikipedia and several other neuroscience introductory articles,
which will be properly cited in this paper. This is the last of the three
tutorial articles about the brain. The readers are suggested to read this paper
after the previous two tutorial articles on brain structure and functions [17]
as well as the brain basic neural units [16].
