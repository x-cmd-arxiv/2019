Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model, is computationally expensive to solve.
Typically simpler models, such as the single particle model (SPM), are used to
provide insight for control purposes. Recently, there has been a move to extend
the SPM to include electrolyte effects, which increase the accuracy and range
of applicability. However, these extended models are derived in an ad-hoc
manner, which leaves open the possibility that important terms may have been
neglected, resulting in the model not being as accurate as possible. In this
paper, we provide a systematic asymptotic derivation of both the SPM and a
correction term that accounts for the behaviour in the electrolyte. Firstly,
this allows us to quantify the error in the reduced model in terms of ratios of
key parameters in the model, from which the range of applicable operating
conditions can be determined. Secondly, in comparing our model with the ad-hoc
models from the literature, we show that previous models have neglected a key
set of terms. In particular, we make the crucial distinction between writing
the terminal voltage in pointwise and electrode-averaged form, which allows us
to gain additional accuracy whilst maintaining the same computational
complexity as the existing models.

networks, little is known about the basic properties of the induced code, and
how they compare to human language. One fundamental characteristic of the
latter, known as Zipf's Law of Abbreviation (ZLA), is that more frequent words
are efficiently associated to shorter strings. We study whether the same
pattern emerges when two neural networks, a ""speaker"" and a ""listener"", are
trained to play a signaling game. Surprisingly, we find that networks develop
an \emph{anti-efficient} encoding scheme, in which the most frequent inputs are
associated to the longest messages, and messages in general are skewed towards
the maximum length threshold. This anti-efficient code appears easier to
discriminate for the listener, and, unlike in human communication, the speaker
does not impose a contrasting least-effort pressure towards brevity. Indeed,
when the cost function includes a penalty for longer messages, the resulting
message distribution starts respecting ZLA. Our analysis stresses the
importance of studying the basic features of emergent communication in a highly
controlled setup, to ensure the latter will not strand too far from human
language. Moreover, we present a concrete illustration of how different
functional pressures can lead to successful communication codes that lack basic
properties of human language, thus highlighting the role such pressures play in
the latter.

setting, the strategic behavior of players is complemented by an external
device that privately recommends moves to agents as the game progresses;
players are free to deviate at any time, but will then not receive future
recommendations. Our contributions are threefold. First, we show that an EFCE
can be formulated as the solution to a bilinear saddle-point problem. To
showcase how this novel formulation can inspire new algorithms to compute
EFCEs, we propose a simple subgradient descent method which exploits this
formulation and structural properties of EFCEs. Our method has better
scalability than the prior approach based on linear programming. Second, we
propose two benchmark games, which we hope will serve as the basis for future
evaluation of EFCE solvers. These games were chosen so as to cover two natural
application domains for EFCE: conflict resolution via a mediator, and
bargaining and negotiation. Third, we document the qualitative behavior of EFCE
in our proposed games. We show that the social-welfare-maximizing equilibria in
these games are highly nontrivial and exhibit surprisingly subtle sequential
behavior that so far has not received attention in the literature.

information of each archived web page is stored in a JSON file (or a manifest),
and published in a well-known web location (an Archival Fixity server) before
it is disseminated to several on-demand web archives. In the Block approach, we
first batch together fixity information of multiple archived pages in a single
binary-searchable file (or a block) before it is published and disseminated to

from archives. Instead, we compute the fixity information (e.g., hash values)
based on the playback of archived resources. One advantage of the Atomic
approach is the ability to verify fixity of archived pages even with the
absence of the Archival Fixity server. The Block approach requires pushing
fewer resources into archives, and it performs fixity verification faster than

eye in the images; the other main rings are visible in a radial

the range of known deep generative models,
$\mathcal{G}^{(1)}:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^\ell$ and
$\mathcal{G}^{(2)}:\mathbb{R}^p\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^\ell$. In the case when
the networks corresponding to the generative models are expansive, the weight
matrices are random and the dimension of the unknown vectors satisfy $\ell =
\Omega(n^2+p^2)$, up to log factors, we show that the empirical risk objective
has a favorable landscape for optimization. That is, the objective function has
a descent direction at every point outside of a small neighborhood around four
hyperbolic curves. We also characterize the local maximizers of the empirical
risk objective and, hence, show that there does not exist any other stationary
points outside of these neighborhood around four hyperbolic curves and the set
of local maximizers. We also implement a gradient descent scheme inspired by
the geometry of the landscape of the objective function. In order to converge
to a global minimizer, this gradient descent scheme exploits the fact that
exactly one of the hyperbolic curve corresponds to the global minimizer, and
thus points near this hyperbolic curve have a lower objective value than points
close to the other spurious hyperbolic curves. We show that this gradient
descent scheme can effectively remove distortions synthetically introduced to
the MNIST dataset.

memory assisted quantum communication and computing. While even a simple
optical fiber can act as a convenient and reliable storage device, its storage
time is tightly fixed and cannot be adapted. Therefore, the photon storage
should ideally be actively controllable by external means, such as magnetic or
electric control fields. In order to multiplex several photons, an active
routing would also be desirable. Here we show that single photons of a
semiconductor quantum dot can be deliberately delayed by an atomic vapor. Also,
the output path can be selected, depending on an external magnetic field. By
selecting the input polarization of the photons and by aligning the external
magnetic field of the hot atomic vapor, the delay-based storage can be fine
tuned to a deliberate value. With an overall delay of 25 ns, we are able to
fine tune by more than 600 ps. Depending on the input polarization, the photons
are routed into different output ports. The experimental data is fully

under consideration of spectral diffusion and considers the complex refractive

synchrotron emission from such shocks, including the build-up and cooling of
the particle population as it accelerates along the IBS. For reasonable

have been proposed for checking this property: (1) type systems and other
static analyses, which fully automate straightforward reasoning with concepts
like ""program sensitivity"" and ""privacy loss,"" and (2) full-blown program
logics such as apRHL (an approximate, probabilistic, relational Hoare logic)
[Barthe et al. 2016], which support more flexible reasoning about subtle
privacy-preserving algorithmic techniques but offer only minimal automation.
  We propose a three-level logic for differential privacy in an imperative
setting and present a prototype implementation called Fuzzi. Fuzzi's lowest
level is a general-purpose logic; its middle level is apRHL; and its top level
is a novel sensitivity logic adapted from the linear-logic-inspired type system
of Fuzz, a differentially private functional language [Reed and Pierce 2010].
The key novelty is a high degree of integration between the sensitivity logic
and the two lower-level logics: the judgments and proofs of the sensitivity
logic can be easily translated into apRHL; conversely, privacy properties of
key algorithmic building blocks can be proved manually in apRHL and the base
logic, then packaged up as typing rules that can be applied by a checker for
the sensitivity logic to automatically construct privacy proofs for composite
programs of arbitrary size.
  We demonstrate Fuzzi's utility by implementing four different private
machine-learning algorithms and showing that Fuzzi's checker is able to derive
tight sensitivity bounds.

unsatisfied customers. We propose a machine learning system which learns the
user behaviour from multiple previous sessions and predicts useful metrics for
the current session. In turn, these metrics can be used by the applications to
customize and better target the customer, which can mean anything from offering
better offers of specific products, targeted notifications or placing smart

Analytics Enhanced E-commerce, which is enabled by most e-commerce websites and
thus the system can be used by any such merchant. In order to learn the user
patterns, only its behaviour features were used, which don't include names,
gender or any other personal information that could identify the user. The
learning model that was used is a double recurrent neural network which learns
both intra-session and inter-session features. The model predicts for each

for blood vessels in retinal fundus images, ranging from using cheap and fast
trainable filters to complicated neural networks and even deep learning. One
example of a filted-based segmentation method is B-COSFIRE. In this approach
the image filter is trained with example prototype patterns, to which the
filter becomes selective by finding points in a Difference of Gaussian response
on circles around the center with large intensity variation. In this paper we
discuss and evaluate several of these vessel segmentation methods. We take a
closer look at B-COSFIRE and study the performance of B-COSFIRE on the recently
published IOSTAR dataset by experiments and we examine how the parameter values
affect the performance. In the experiment we manage to reach a segmentation
accuracy of 0.9419. Based on our findings we discuss when B-COSFIRE is the
preferred method to use and in which circumstances it could be beneficial to
use a more (computationally) complex segmentation method. We also shortly
discuss areas beyond blood vessel segmentation where these methods can be used
to segment elongated structures, such as rivers in satellite images or nerves
of a leaf.

This reflex is known as Lombard effect. Collecting speech in Lombard conditions
is usually hard and costly. For this reason, speech enhancement systems are
generally trained and evaluated on speech recorded in quiet to which noise is
artificially added. Since these systems are often used in situations where
Lombard speech occurs, in this work we perform an analysis of the impact that
Lombard effect has on audio, visual and audio-visual speech enhancement,
focusing on deep-learning-based systems, since they represent the current state
of the art in the field.
  We conduct several experiments using an audio-visual Lombard speech corpus
consisting of utterances spoken by 54 different talkers. The results show that
training deep-learning-based models with Lombard speech is beneficial in terms
of both estimated speech quality and estimated speech intelligibility at low
signal to noise ratios, where the visual modality can play an important role in
acoustically challenging situations. We also find that a performance difference
between genders exists due to the distinct Lombard speech exhibited by males
and females, and we analyse it in relation with acoustic and visual features.
Furthermore, listening tests conducted with audio-visual stimuli show that the
speech quality of the signals processed with systems trained using Lombard
speech is statistically significantly better than the one obtained using
systems trained with non-Lombard speech at a signal to noise ratio of -5 dB.
Regarding speech intelligibility, we find a general tendency of the benefit in
training the systems with Lombard speech.

to the wave function orthogonality between majority spin $s$-like states of

While applications like summarization and translation are positive, the
underlying technology also might enable adversaries to generate neural fake
news: targeted propaganda that closely mimics the style of real news.
  Modern computer security relies on careful threat modeling: identifying
potential threats and vulnerabilities from an adversary's point of view, and
exploring potential mitigations to these threats. Likewise, developing robust
defenses against neural fake news requires us first to carefully investigate
and characterize the risks of these models. We thus present a model for
controllable text generation called Grover. Given a headline like `Link Found
Between Vaccines and Autism,' Grover can generate the rest of the article;
humans find these generations to be more trustworthy than human-written
disinformation.
  Developing robust verification techniques against generators like Grover is
critical. We find that best current discriminators can classify neural fake
news from real, human-written, news with 73% accuracy, assuming access to a
moderate level of training data. Counterintuitively, the best defense against
Grover turns out to be Grover itself, with 92% accuracy, demonstrating the
importance of public release of strong generators. We investigate these results
further, showing that exposure bias -- and sampling strategies that alleviate
its effects -- both leave artifacts that similar discriminators can pick up on.

use N-body simulations to show that the stream is likely only on its second

the entire disrupted progenitor is visible in the observed stream today, and
that little further tidal debris lies beyond the ends of the stream. The
luminosity, length, width, and velocity dispersion of the stream suggest a
globular cluster (GC) progenitor substantially fainter and of lower surface

globulars in the Galaxy. This result suggests the existence of clusters that
would extend the known GC population to fainter and more weakly bound systems

type-I seesaw can also account for the origin of the electroweak scale due to
heavy-neutrino threshold corrections to the Higgs potential. In this paper, we
show for the first time that all of these features of the type-I seesaw are
compatible with each other. Integrating out a set of heavy Majorana neutrinos
results in small masses for the Standard Model neutrinos; baryogenesis is
accomplished by resonant leptogenesis; and the Higgs mass is entirely induced
by heavy-neutrino one-loop diagrams, provided that the tree-level Higgs
potential satisfies scale-invariant boundary conditions in the ultraviolet. The
viable parameter space is characterized by a heavy-neutrino mass scale roughly
in the range $10^{6.5\cdots7.0}$ GeV and a mass splitting among the nearly
degenerate heavy-neutrino states up to a few TeV. Our findings have interesting
implications for high-energy flavor models and low-energy neutrino observables.
We conclude that the type-I seesaw sector might be the root cause behind the

composition of planets that form out of them. Recent chemical models have shown
that the composition of gas and dust in discs evolves on Myr time-scales, with
volatile species disappearing from the gas phase. However, discs evolve due to
gas accretion and radial drift of dust on time-scales similar to these chemical
time-scales. Here we present the first model coupling the chemical evolution in
the disc mid-planes with the evolution of discs due to accretion and radial
drift of dust. Our models show that transport will always overcome the
depletion of CO$_2$ from the gas phase, and can also overcome the depletion of
CO and CH$_4$ unless both transport is slow (viscous $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-3}$)
and the ionization rate is high ($\zeta \approx 10^{-17}$). Including radial
drift further enhances the abundances of volatile species because they are
carried in on the surface of grains before evaporating left at their ice lines.
Due to large differences in the abundances within 10 au for models with and
without efficient radial drift, we argue that composition can be used to
constrain models of planet formation via pebble accretion.

particularly difficult because of our limited means to obtain high quality
spectroscopy of extragalactic GCs. Often, `color--metallicity relations' are
invoked to convert easier-to-obtain photometric measurements into
metallicities, but there is no consensus on what form these relations should
take. In this paper we make use of multiple photometric datasets and iron
metallicity values derived from applying full-spectrum stellar population
synthesis models to deep Keck/LRIS spectra of 177 GCs centrally located around
M87 to obtain a new color--metallicity relation. Our new relation differs
substantially from previous relations in the blue, and we present evidence that
the M87 relation differs from that of the Milky Way GCs, suggesting
environmental dependence of GC properties. We use our color--metallicity
relation to derive a new GC metallicity-host galaxy luminosity relation for red
and blue GCs and find a shallower relation for the blue GCs than what previous
work has found and that the metal-poor GCs are more enriched than what was
previously found. This could indicate that the progenitor satellite galaxies
that now make up the stellar halos of early-type galaxies are more massive and
formed later than previously thought, or that the properties of metal-poor GCs
are less dependent on their present-day host, indicating a common origin.

isomorphic. Based on these results we construct a feature map and graph
similarity measure or 'graph kernel' using samples from the device. We show
that the kernel performs well compared to standard graph kernels on typical
benchmark datasets, and provide a theoretical motivation for this success,
linking the distribution of a Gaussian Boson Sampler to the number of matchings
in subgraphs. Our results contribute to a new way of thinking about kernels as
a (quantum) hardware-efficient feature mapping, and lead to an interesting
application for near-term quantum computing.

to constrain the $B$-mode polarisation power spectrum. One class of systematics
that requires careful study is instrumental systematics. The potential impact
of such systematics is most readily understood by considering analysis
pipelines based on pair differencing. In this case, any differential gain,
pointing or beam ellipticity between the two detectors in a pair can result in
intensity leakage into the $B$-mode spectrum, which needs to be controlled to a
high precision due to the much greater magnitude of the total intensity signal
as compared to the $B$-mode signal. One well known way to suppress such
systematics is through careful design of the scan-strategy, in particular
making use of any capability to rotate the instrument about its pointing
(boresight) direction. Here, we show that the combination of specific choices
of such partial boresight rotation angles with redundancies present in the scan
strategy is a powerful approach for suppressing systematic effects. This
mitigation can be performed in analysis in advance of map-making and, in
contrast to other approaches (e.g. deprojection or filtering), results in no
signal loss. We demonstrate our approach explicitly with time ordered data
simulations relevant to next-generation ground-based CMB experiments, using
deep and wide scan strategies appropriate for experiments based in Chile. These
simulations show a reduction of multiple orders of magnitude in the spurious
$B$-mode signal arising from differential gain and differential pointing
systematics.

for empirical risk minimization due to its appealing run time complexity. When
the data size is large and disjointly stored on different machines, it becomes
imperative to distribute the implementation of such variance reduced methods.
In this paper, we consider a general framework that directly distributes
popular stochastic variance reduced methods in the master/slave model, by
assigning outer loops to the parameter server, and inner loops to worker
machines. This framework is natural and friendly to implement, but its
theoretical convergence is not well understood. We obtain a comprehensive
understanding of algorithmic convergence with respect to data homogeneity by
measuring the smoothness of the discrepancy between the local and global loss
functions. We establish the linear convergence of distributed versions of a
family of stochastic variance reduced algorithms, including those using
accelerated and recursive gradient updates, for minimizing strongly convex
losses. Our theory captures how the convergence of distributed algorithms
behaves as the number of machines and the size of local data vary. Furthermore,
we show that when the data are less balanced, regularization can be used to
ensure convergence at a slower rate. We also demonstrate that our analysis can
be further extended to handle nonconvex loss functions.

the inner disk radius for both observations to 11.92$^{+8.62}_{-11.92}$

Therefore, methods such as the CycleGAN use more easily available unlabelled

data distribution into a set of lower-dimensional distributions along with

multiple ""sub-discriminators"" that can be independently trained from incomplete

these worlds. Using simulated TESS populations we identify the Nine, a set of
archetypal exoplanets with the potential to be bright in reflected light,
because of their radii and proximity to their star, while still being cool
enough to have minimal thermal contamination at optical wavelengths. For each
planet we compute albedo spectra for several cloud and atmosphere assumptions
(e.g. thermochemical equilibrium, solar composition). We find that in the TESS
bandpass the estimated contrast at optical wavelengths is typically <10 ppm
except for the brightest, largest, or closest in planets with the highest
lofted clouds where contrast can reach a few tens of ppm. Meanwhile, in a bluer
bandpass (0.3--0.5 microns) the estimated contrast can be as high as 150 ppm

highest, most extensive cloud decks are generally darker at bluer wavelengths

objects from a collection of images without any human annotation. Our method
builds on the observation that the location of object segments can be perturbed
locally relative to a given background without affecting the realism of a
scene. Our approach is to first train a generative model of a layered scene.
The layered representation consists of a background image, a foreground image
and the mask of the foreground. A composite image is then obtained by
overlaying the masked foreground image onto the background. The generative
model is trained in an adversarial fashion against a discriminator, which
forces the generative model to produce realistic composite images. To force the
generator to learn a representation where the foreground layer corresponds to
an object, we perturb the output of the generative model by introducing a
random shift of both the foreground image and mask relative to the background.
Because the generator is unaware of the shift before computing its output, it
must produce layered representations that are realistic for any such random
perturbation. Finally, we learn to segment an image by defining an autoencoder
consisting of an encoder, which we train, and the pre-trained generator as the
decoder, which we freeze. The encoder maps an image to a feature vector, which
is fed as input to the generator to give a composite image matching the
original input image. Because the generator outputs an explicit layered
representation of the scene, the encoder learns to detect and segment objects.
We demonstrate this framework on real images of several object categories.

causal or Bayesian Network (BN) graphs. The validity of these algorithms tends
to be evaluated by assessing the relationship between the learnt and the ground
truth graph. However, there is no agreed scoring metric to determine this
relationship. Moreover, this paper shows that some of the commonly used metrics
tend to be biased in favour of graphs that minimise edges. While graphs that
are less complex are desirable, some of the metrics favour underfitted graphs,
thereby encouraging limited propagation of evidence. This paper proposes the
Balanced Scoring Function (BSF) that eliminates this bias by adjusting the
reward function based on the difficulty of discovering an edge, or no edge,
proportional to their occurrence rate in the ground truth graph. The BSF score
can be used in conjunction with other traditional metrics to provide an
alternative and unbiased assessment about the capability of a structure
learning algorithm in discovering causal or BN graphs.

BHs comprising each binary are unlikely to be randomly drawn from the same
underlying distribution. Instead, the two BHs of a given binary prefer to be of
comparable mass. We show that it is $\sim 5$ times more likely that the
component BHs in a given binary are always equal (to within 5\%) than that they
are randomly paired. If we assume that the probability of a merger between two
BHs scales with the mass ratio $q$ as $q^\beta$, so that $\beta=0$ corresponds
to random pairings, we find $\beta>0$ is favored at credibility 0.987. By
modeling the mass distribution, we find that the median mass ratio is $q_{50\%}
= 0.91^{+0.05}_{-0.17}$ at 90\% credibility. While the pairing between BHs
depends on their mass ratio, we find no evidence that it depends on the total
mass of the system: it is $\sim 6$ times more likely that the pairing depends
purely on the mass ratio than on the total mass. We predict that 99\% of BBHs
detected by LIGO/Virgo will have mass ratios $q > 0.5$. We conclude that
merging black holes do not form random pairings; instead they are selective
about their partners, preferring to mate with black holes of a similar mass.
The details of these selective pairings provide insight into the underlying
formation channels of merging binaries.

Second, different modalities overfit and generalize at different rates, so
training them jointly with a single optimization strategy is sub-optimal. We
address these two problems with a technique we call Gradient Blending, which

sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and robot navigation. On the

solutions that significantly improve the RGB only approaches. That is why this
is an interesting research area for both industry and academia. Compared with
2D image-based systems, 3D-based systems are more complicated due to the
following five reasons: 1) Data representation itself is more complicated. 3D
images can be represented by point clouds, meshes, volumes. 2D images have
pixel grid representations. 2) The computation and memory resource requirement
is higher as an extra dimension is added. 3) Different distribution of the
objects and difference in scene areas between indoor and outdoor make one
unified framework hard to achieve. 4) 3D data, especially for the outdoor
scenario, is sparse compared with the dense 2D images which makes the detection
task more challenging. Finally, large size labelled datasets, which are
extremely important for supervised based algorithms, are still under
construction compared with well-built 2D datasets such as ImageNet. Based on
challenges listed above, the described systems are organized by application
scenarios, data representation methods and main tasks addressed. At the same

many of which show extended gas features. The detection threshold was designed
to reach mean emission-line surface brightness 10 times fainter than seen in
such AGN-ionized clouds as Hanny's Voorwerp, so that similar structures at
larger distances (and ages) could be detected. Of 24 Seyfert galaxies, we find
one extended emission feature, a discrete cloud projected 12 kpc from the
center of Mkn 1 and spanning a transverse extent of 8 kpc. Optical spectroscopy
of the Mkn 1 cloud confirms its redshift association with the Mkn 1- NGC 451
galaxy pair, shows it to closely match the kinematics of nearby H I, and
reveals emission-line ratios requiring photoionization by the AGN at roughly
the direct observed luminosity of the nucleus. Given the small fraction of H I
features with detected [O III] emission, we constrain the typical opening angle
of ionization cones in Seyfert galaxies to be of order 20 deg, if active
episodes are long compared to the light-travel times involved. An appendix
presents a derivation of an analytical expression for the probability of
intersection of a cone with randomly oriented arcs, approximating the geometry
of H I clouds and tails exposed to ionization cones. For the entire sample, the
full opening angle of bicones must be <20 deg if the AGN are continuously
bright for scales longer than the light-travel times across the H I structures.
Since many ionization cones are observed to be much broader than this, our low
detection fraction may add to evidence for the ubiquity of strong variations in
AGN luminosity on scales 10,000-100,000 years.

response $Y \in \R$ depend, jointly, on a lower dimensional, unobserved, latent

and mainly used for predicting a response from correlated features. In
contrast, methodology and theory for inference on the regression coefficient
$\beta$ relating $Y$ to $Z$ are scarce, since typically the un-observable
factor $Z$ is hard to interpret. Furthermore, the determination of the
asymptotic variance of an estimator of $\beta$ is a long-standing problem, with
solutions known only in a few particular cases. To address some of these
outstanding questions, we develop inferential tools for $\beta$ in a class of
factor regression models in which the observed features are signed mixtures of
the latent factors. The model specifications are practically desirable, in a
large array of applications, render interpretability to the components of $Z$,
and are sufficient for parameter identifiability. Without assuming that the
number of latent factors $K$ or the structure of the mixture is known in
advance, we construct computationally efficient estimators of $\beta$, along
with estimators of other important model parameters. We benchmark the rate of
convergence of $\beta$ by first establishing its $\ell_2$-norm minimax lower
bound, and show that our proposed estimator is minimax-rate adaptive. Our main
contribution is the provision of a unified analysis of the component-wise
Gaussian asymptotic distribution of $\wh \beta$ and, especially, the derivation
of a closed form expression of its asymptotic variance, together with
consistent variance estimators. The resulting inferential tools can be used
when both $K$ and $p$ are independent of the sample size $n$, and when both, or

adversarial networks apply the principles of evolutionary computation to
mitigate these problems. We hybridize two of these approaches that promote
training diversity. One, E-GAN, at each batch, injects mutation diversity by
training the (replicated) generator with three independent objective functions
then selecting the resulting best performing generator for the next batch. The
other, Lipizzaner, injects population diversity by training a two-dimensional
grid of GANs with a distributed evolutionary algorithm that includes neighbor
exchanges of additional training adversaries, performance based selection and
population-based hyper-parameter tuning. We propose to combine mutation and
population approaches to diversity improvement. We contribute a superior
evolutionary GANs training method, Mustangs, that eliminates the single loss
function used across Lipizzaner's grid. Instead, each training round, a loss
function is selected with equal probability, from among the three E-GAN uses.
Experimental analyses on standard benchmarks, MNIST and CelebA, demonstrate
that Mustangs provides a statistically faster training method resulting in more
accurate networks.

disappear as the target shape index approaches a critical value ($s^*_{0} \sim

this same critical point. However, the ordered ground states of 2D vertex
models become linearly unstable at a lower value of the target shape index
(3.72) [1,2]. We investigate whether the ground states of the 2D vertex model
are fluid-like or solid-like between 3.72 and 3.81 $-$ does the ""equation of

only one? Using four-cell and many-cell numerical simulations, we demonstrate
that for a hexagonal ground state, T1 energy barriers only vanish at $\sim

expectiles in fields such as econometrics, risk management, and extreme value
theory, expectile regression---or, more generally, M-quantile
regression---unfortunately remains limited to single-output problems. To
improve on this, we introduce hyperplane-valued multivariate M-quantiles that
show strong advantages, for instance in terms of equivariance, over the various
point-valued multivariate M-quantiles available in the literature. Like their
competitors, our multivariate M-quantiles are directional in nature and provide
centrality regions when all directions are considered. These regions define a
new statistical depth, the halfspace M-depth, whose deepest point, in the
expectile case, is the mean vector. Remarkably, the halfspace M-depth can
alternatively be obtained by substituting, in the celebrated Tukey (1975)
halfspace depth, M-quantile outlyingness for standard quantile outlyingness,
which supports a posteriori the claim that our multivariate M-quantile concept
is the natural one. We investigate thoroughly the properties of the proposed
multivariate M-quantiles, of halfspace M-depth, and of the corresponding
regions. Since our original motivation was to define multiple-output expectile
regression methods, we further focus on the expectile case. We show in
particular that expectile depth is smoother than the Tukey depth and enjoys
interesting monotonicity properties that are extremely promising for
computational purposes. Unlike their quantile analogs, the proposed
multivariate expectiles also satisfy the coherency axioms of multivariate risk

camera of the stereo pair, and the scale is recovered and optimized by directly
minimizing the photometric error. It is computationally efficient, adding
minimal overhead to the stereo vision system compared to straightforward stereo

optimization enables stereo visual odometry to be purely based on the direct

in different ways by decision makers, other actors dealing with data and
models, and ultimately by the individuals being affected by these decisions.
One frequent manifestation of all these latent causes arises in the form of
missing values: protected groups are more reluctant to give information that
could be used against them, delicate information for some groups can be erased
by human operators, or data acquisition may simply be less complete and
systematic for minority groups. As a result, missing values and bias in data
are two phenomena that are tightly coupled. However, most recent techniques,
libraries and experimental results dealing with fairness in machine learning
have simply ignored missing data. In this paper, we claim that fairness
research should not miss the opportunity to deal properly with missing data. To
support this claim, (1) we analyse the sources of missing data and bias, and we
map the common causes, (2) we find that rows containing missing values are
usually fairer than the rest, which should not be treated as the uncomfortable
ugly data that different techniques and libraries get rid of at the first
occasion, and (3) we study the trade-off between performance and fairness when
the rows with missing values are used (either because the technique deals with
them directly or by imputation methods). We end the paper with a series of
recommended procedures about what to do with missing data when aiming for fair
decision making.

tool for the composite and constrained problems in machine learning. However,
in many machine learning problems such as black-box attacks and bandit
feedback, ADMM could fail because the explicit gradients of these problems are
difficult or infeasible to obtain. Zeroth-order (gradient-free) methods can
effectively solve these problems due to that the objective function values are
only required in the optimization. Recently, though there exist a few
zeroth-order ADMM methods, they build on the convexity of objective function.
Clearly, these existing zeroth-order methods are limited in many applications.
In the paper, thus, we propose a class of fast zeroth-order stochastic ADMM
methods (i.e., ZO-SVRG-ADMM and ZO-SAGA-ADMM) for solving nonconvex problems
with multiple nonsmooth penalties, based on the coordinate smoothing gradient
estimator. Moreover, we prove that both the ZO-SVRG-ADMM and ZO-SAGA-ADMM have
convergence rate of $O(1/T)$, where $T$ denotes the number of iterations. In
particular, our methods not only reach the best convergence rate $O(1/T)$ for
the nonconvex optimization, but also are able to effectively solve many complex
machine learning problems with multiple regularized penalties and constraints.
Finally, we conduct the experiments of black-box binary classification and
structured adversarial attack on black-box deep neural network to validate the

quickly retrieve sketches in the repository that are related to a sketch of

can be truly sound. In spite of this concern, research on techniques seeking to
at least partially answer undecidable questions has a long history. However,
little attention has been given to the more empirical question of how often an
exact solution might be given to a question despite the question being, at
least in theory, undecidable. This paper investigates this issue by exploring
sub-Turing islands -- regions of code for which a question of interest is
decidable. We define such islands and then consider how to identify them. We
implemented Cook, a prototype for finding sub-Turing islands and applied it to
a corpus of 1100 Android applications, containing over 2 million methods.
Results reveal that 55\% of the all methods are sub-Turing. Our results also
provide empirical, scientific evidence for the scalability of sub-Turing island
identification. Sub-Turing identification has many downstream applications,
because islands are so amenable to static analysis. We illustrate two
downstream uses of the analysis. In the first, we found that over 37\% of the
verification conditions associated with runtime exceptions fell within
sub-Turing islands and thus are statically decidable. A second use of our
analysis is during code review where it provides guidance to developers. The
sub-Turing islands from our study turns out to contain significantly fewer bugs
than `theswamp' (non sub-Turing methods). The greater bug density in the swamp
is unsurprising; the fact that bugs remain prevalent in islands is, however,
surprising: these are bugs whose repair can be fully automated.

Measurements of the intrinsic sizes of the different CO emission lines indicate

Similarly, we find smaller dust continuum intrinsic sizes with decreasing
wavelength, based on observations at rest-frame 130, 300 and 450$\mu$m. The
source shows significant velocity structure, and clear asymmetry where an
elongated structure is observed in the source plane with significant variations
in their reconstructed sizes. This could be attributed to a compact merger or
turbulent disk rotation. The differences in velocity structure through the
different line tracers, however, hint at the former scenario in agreement with
previous [CII] line imaging results. Measurements of the CO line ratios and
magnifications yield significant variations as a function of velocity,

adjusting for confounding features of the text such as the subject or writing

practice, it is prohibitively high-dimensional. To address this challenge, we
develop causally sufficient embeddings, low-dimensional document
representations that preserve sufficient information for causal identification
and allow for efficient estimation of causal effects. Causally sufficient
embeddings combine two ideas. The first is supervised dimensionality reduction:
causal adjustment requires only the aspects of text that are predictive of both
the treatment and outcome. The second is efficient language modeling:
representations of text are designed to dispose of linguistically irrelevant
information, and this information is also causally irrelevant. Our method
adapts language models (specifically, word embeddings and topic models) to
learn document embeddings that are able to predict both treatment and outcome.
We study causally sufficient embeddings with semi-synthetic datasets and find
that they improve causal estimation over related embedding methods. We

solving a large sparse nonlinear programming problem that arises from the
approximation of an optimal control problem using a direct collocation method.
In particular, the Taylor series-based finite-difference, bicomplex-step, and
hyper-dual derivative estimation methods are evaluated and compared alongside a
well known automatic differentiation method. The performance of each derivative
estimation method is assessed based on the number of iterations, the
computation time per iteration, and the total computation time required to
solve the nonlinear programming problem. The efficiency of each of the four
derivative estimation methods is compared by solving three benchmark optimal
control problems. It is found that while central finite-differencing is
typically more efficient per iteration than either the hyper-dual or
bicomplex-step, the latter two methods have significantly lower overall
computation times due to the fact that fewer iterations are required by the
nonlinear programming problem when compared with central finite-differencing.
Furthermore, while the bicomplex-step and hyper-dual methods are similar in
performance, the hyper-dual method is significantly easier to implement.
Moreover, the automatic differentiation method is found to be substantially
less computationally efficient than any of the three Taylor series-based
methods. The results of this study show that the hyper-dual method offers
several benefits over the other three methods both in terms of computational
efficiency and ease of implementation.

with semiconducting, semi-metallic, and metallic properties. The dynamic
control of these phases is of immediate interest for next generation
electronics such as phase change memories. Of the binary Mo and W-based TMDs,
MoTe2 is attractive for electronic applications because it has the lowest
energy difference (40 meV) between the semiconducting (2H) and semi-metallic
(1T') phases, allowing for MoTe2 phase change by electrostatic doping. Here we
report phase change between the 2H and 1T' polymorphs of MoTe2 in thicknesses
ranging from the monolayer case to effective bulk (73nm) using an ionic liquid
electrolyte at room temperature and in air. We find consistent evidence of a
partially reversible 2H-1T' transition using in-situ Raman spectroscopy where
the phase change occurs in the top-most layers of the MoTe2 flake. We find a
thickness-dependent transition voltage where higher voltages are necessary to
drive the phase change for thicker flakes. We also show evidence of
electrochemical activity during the gating process by observation of Te metal
deposition. This finding suggests the formation of Te vacancies which have been
reported to lower the energy difference between the 2H and 1T' phase,
potentially aiding the phase change process. Our discovery that the phase
change can be achieved on the surface layer of bulk materials reveals that this
electrochemical mechanism does not require isolation of a single layer and the
effect may be more broadly applicable than previously thought.

idea is that different segments of a program can be compiled with different
compilers/optimizers and combined into a single executable. The MCompiler can
be used in a number of ways. It can generate an executable with higher
performance than any individual compiler, because each compiler uses a
specific, ordered set of optimization techniques and different profitability
models and can, therefore, generate code significantly different from other
compilers. Alternatively, the MCompiler can be used by researchers and compiler
developers to evaluate their compiler implementation and compare it to results
from other available compilers/optimizers.
  A code segment in this work is a loop nest, but other choices are possible.
This work also investigates the use of Machine Learning to learn inherent
characteristics of loop nests and then predict during compilation the most
suited code optimizer for each loop nest in an application. This reduces the
need for profiling applications as well as the compilation time.
  The results show that our framework improves the overall performance for
applications over state-of-the-art compilers by a geometric mean of 1.96x for
auto-vectorized code and 2.62x for auto-parallelized code. Parallel
applications with OpenMP directives are also improved by the MCompiler, with a
geometric mean performance improvement of 1.04x (up to 1.74x). The use of
Machine Learning prediction achieves performance very close to the
profiling-based search for choosing the most suited code optimizer: within 4%
for auto-vectorized code and within 8% for auto-parallelized code. Finally, the
MCompiler can be expanded to collect metrics other than performance to be used
in optimization process. The example presented is collecting energy data.

Fowler-Nordheim (FN) plot. Several years ago, the development of an ""orthodoxy
test"" allowed a sample of 19 published FN plots relating to LAFEs to be tested,
and it was found that about 40% of the related papers were reporting spuriously
high values for {\gamma}_C. In technological papers relating to LAFE
characterization, common practice is to pre-convert the measured voltage into
an (apparent) value of macroscopic field before making and analyzing a FN plot.
This paper suggests that the cause of the ""spurious-FEF-value"" problem is the
widespread use of a pre-conversion equation that is defective (for example, not
compatible with ordinary electrical circuit theory) when it is applied to
so-called ""non-ideal"" field emission devices/systems. Many real devices/
systems are non-ideal. The author argues that FN plots should be made using raw
experimental current-voltage data, and that an orthodoxy test should be applied
to the resulting FN plot before any more-detailed analysis, and that (in view
of growing concerns over the reliability of published ""scientific"" results)
reviewers should scrutinize field emission materials-characterization papers
with enhanced care.

the eddy-viscosity for large eddy simulation (LES) of wall-bounded turbulent
flows. A deep neural network (DNN) is developed which learns to evaluate the
eddy-viscosity from a dataset generated for a channel flow at friction Reynolds
number $Re_{\tau} = 395$ using the Dynamic Smagorinsky subgrid-scale model.
Later this DNN is employed to predict the eddy-viscosity for a number of grid
configurations for channel flow at $Re_{\tau} = 395$ and $590$. The statistics
computed from the DNN based LES model show an excellent match with direct
numerical simulations (DNS). In some cases, particularly for the coarse grid
simulations, the DNN based model yields statistics closer to DNS than those
from the Dynamic Smagorinsky model. The turbulent kinetic energy budget terms
also manifest a satisfactory match with the DNS results. This model computes
eddy-viscosity $2-8$ times quicker than the Dynamic Smagorinsky model. This DNN
based LES model is also able to closely mimic the duct flow at $Re_{\tau} =
300$ in a qualitatively and quantitatively similar manner as the LES using the
Dynamic Smagorinsky model and a DNS from a previous study. This study
demonstrates the feasibility of deep learning for parameterizing the
subgrid-scales (SGS) in a turbulent flow accurately in a cost-effective manner.
In a broader perspective, deep learning based models can be a promising
alternative to traditional RANS and LES models for simulating complex turbulent

of a contribution from a resonance involving carbon atoms on the perimeter and
coherent contributions from carbon atoms inside the perimeter. In the case of
pyrene, the two interior atoms are associated with a resonance peak at 10 eV
and linear behavior above 75 eV. The resonance peak is an optically excited
state of the interior carbon pair. The linear behavior arises from the coherent
emission of two electrons with equal energy and opposite momenta, as occurs in
pyrrole. Coronene has a low energy peak along with two pairing resonances,
however, the linear region as in the case of pyrene is absent. The low energy
resonance is associated with the atoms on the perimeter and the high energy

Laterally, collecting well-annotated data is expensive, time-consuming and

the network with more data from an alternate representative dataset. This can
lead to adverse effects if the statistics of the representative dataset are

feature extractor from the representative domain is used. In this paper, we
propose a new technique ($d$-SNE) of domain adaptation that cleverly uses
stochastic neighborhood embedding techniques and a novel modified-Hausdorff

ideally suited to train neural networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that

the online bipartite matching problem where each edge has a probability of
success. When a match is made it succeeds with the probability of the
corresponding edge. Introducing this model, Mehta and Panigrahi (FOCS 2012)
focused on the special case of identical edge probabilities. Comparing against
a deterministic offline LP, they showed that the Ranking algorithm of Karp et
al. (STOC 1990) is 0.534 competitive and proposed a new online algorithm with
an improved guarantee of $0.567$ for vanishingly small probabilities. For the
case of vanishingly small but heterogeneous probabilities Mehta et al. (SODA
2015), gave a 0.534 competitive algorithm against the same LP benchmark. For
the more general vertex-weighted version of the problem, to the best of our

  We focus on the vertex-weighted version and give two improvements. First, we
show that a natural generalization of the Perturbed-Greedy algorithm of
Aggarwal et al. (SODA 2011), is $(1-1/e)$ competitive when probabilities
decompose as a product of two factors, one corresponding to each vertex of the
edge. This is the best achievable guarantee as it includes the case of
identical probabilities and in particular, the classical online bipartite
matching problem. Second, we give a deterministic $0.596$ competitive algorithm
for the previously well studied case of fully heterogeneous but vanishingly
small edge probabilities. A key contribution of our approach is the use of
novel path-based analysis. This allows us to compare against the natural
benchmarks of adaptive offline algorithms that know the sequence of arrivals

a representation. We find that, in a trained network, the ID is orders of
magnitude smaller than the number of units in each layer. Across layers, the ID
first increases and then progressively decreases in the final layers.
Remarkably, the ID of the last hidden layer predicts classification accuracy on
the test set. These results can neither be found by linear dimensionality
estimates (e.g., with principal component analysis), nor in representations
that had been artificially linearized. They are neither found in untrained

that neural networks that can generalize are those that transform the data into

simultaneous Spitzer and VLA data of GM Aur separated by ~1 wk. These data are
compared to previously published HST and Chandra observations from which mass
accretion rates ($\dot M$) and X-ray luminosities, respectively, were measured.
The mid-infrared emission increases along with $\dot M$, and we conclude that
this is due to an increase in the mass in the inner disk. The cm emission,
which probes the jet, also appears to increase as $\dot M$ increases, and the
changes in the cm flux are consistent with the variability in $\dot M$ assuming
the mass-loss rate is ~10% $\dot M$. The 3 cm emission morphology also appears
changed compared with observations taken three years previously, suggesting
that for the first time, we may be tracking changes in the jet morphology of a
TTS. The X-ray luminosity is constant throughout the three epochs, ruling out
variable high-energy stellar radiation as the cause for the increases in the
mid-infrared or cm emission. Tying together the multiwavelength variability
observed, we conclude that an increase in the surface density in the inner disk
resulted in more mass loading onto the star and therefore a higher $\dot M$,
which led to a higher mass-loss rate in the jet. These results stress the
importance of coordinated multiwavelength work to better understand the

received renewed interest due to their success on discriminative natural
language understanding tasks such as question-answering and natural language
inference. The problem of generating sequences directly from these models has
received relatively little attention, in part because generating from
undirected models departs significantly from conventional monotonic generation
in directed sequence models. We investigate this problem by proposing a
generalized model of sequence generation that unifies decoding in directed and
undirected models. The proposed framework models the process of generation
rather than the resulting sequence, and under this framework, we derive various
neural sequence models as special cases, such as autoregressive,
semi-autoregressive, and refinement-based non-autoregressive models. This
unification enables us to adapt decoding algorithms originally developed for
directed sequence models to undirected sequence models. We demonstrate this by
evaluating various handcrafted and learned decoding strategies on a BERT-like
machine translation model (Lample & Conneau, 2019). The proposed approach
achieves constant-time translation results on par with linear-time translation
results from the same undirected sequence model, while both are competitive
with the state-of-the-art on WMT'14 English-German translation.

symbolic models for networks of discrete-time switched systems. We first define
a notion of so-called augmented-storage functions to relate switched subsystems
and their symbolic models. Then we show that if some dissipativity type
conditions are satisfied, one can establish a notion of so-called alternating
simulation function as a relation between a network of symbolic models and that
of switched subsystems. The alternating simulation function provides an upper
bound for the mismatch between the output behavior of the interconnection of
switched subsystems and that of their symbolic models. Moreover, we provide an
approach to construct symbolic models for discrete-time switched subsystems

languages such as Verilog-AMS for system-level simulations are typically
functional models. They do not capture the physical design (layout) information
of the target design. Numerous iterations of post-layout design adjustments are
usually required to ensure that design specifications are met with the presence
of layout parasitics. In this paper a paradigm shift of the current trend is
presented that integrates layout-level information in Verilog-AMS through
metamodels such that system-level simulation of a mixed-signal circuit/system
is realistic and as accurate as true parasitic netlist simulation. The
simulations performed with these parasitic-aware models can be used to estimate
system performance without layout iterations. We call this new form of
Verilog-AMS as iVAMS (i.e. Intelligent Verilog-AMS). We call this iVAMS 1.0 as
it is simple polynomial-metamodel integrated Intelligent Verilog-AMS. As a
specific case study, a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) Verilog-AMS
behavioral model and design flow are proposed to assist fast PLL design space
exploration. The PLL simulation employing quadratic metamodels achieves
approximately 10X speedup compared to that employing the layout extracted,
parasitic netlist. The simulations using this behavioral model attain high
accuracy. The observed error for the simulated lock time and average power
dissipation are 0.7% and 3%, respectively. This behavioral metamodel approach
bridges the gap between layout-accurate but fast simulation and design space
exploration. The proposed method also allows much shorter design verification
and optimization to meet stringent time-to-market requirements. Compared to the
optimization using the layout netlist, the runtime using the behavioral model
is reduced by 88.9%.

plane, jetted AGNs can be generally divided into two populations. Low power
radio galaxies, low excitation FR IIs (LEG/FR IIs), and most YRSs show larger
jet power than accretion power, while FSRQs, RL-NLS1s, and high excitation FR
IIs (HEG/FR IIs) are on the contrary. LEG/FR IIs share similar jet power
properties with HEG/FR IIs, while their accretion properties are different with
the latter. These facts suggest an evolutional sequence from HEG/FR IIs, LEG/FR
IIs to FR Is, where the accretion and jet activities get dimmed gradually.
LEG/FR IIs are the transitional objects that accretion processes have switched
off, while jets are still active. After correcting the contribution from radio
core of blazars, the unification between blazars and radio galaxies is
confirmed with the jet power distributions. The unification involved RL-NLS1s
is more complicated than the simple scenarios of black hole growth or
orientation effect. In addition, our results manifest that low synchrotron

power, with one group similar with FSRQs and the other similar with
intermediate synchrotron peaked BL Lacs. The LBLs with higher jet powers might

provide an elegant approach to force-unification. With bulk curvature as high
as the Planck scale, higher curvature terms, namely f(R) gravity seems to be a
natural addendum in the bulk action. These can not only pass the classic tests
of general relativity but also serve as potential alternatives to dark matter
and dark energy. With interesting implications in inflationary cosmology,
gravitational waves and particle phenomenology it is worth exploring the impact
of extra dimensions and f(R) gravity in black hole accretion. Various classes
of black hole solutions have been derived which bear non-trivial imprints of
these ultraviolet corrections to general relativity. This in turn gets engraved
in the continuum spectrum emitted by the accretion disk around black holes.
Since the near horizon regime of supermassive black holes manifest maximum
curvature effects, we compare the theoretical estimates of disk luminosity with
quasar optical data to discern the effect of the modified background on the
spectrum. In particular, we explore a certain class of black hole solution
bearing a striking resemblance with the well-known Reissner Nordstrom de
Sitter/anti-de Sitter/flat spacetime which unlike general relativity can also
accommodate a negative charge parameter. By computing error estimators like
chi-square, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, index of agreement, etc. we infer that
optical observations of quasars favor a negative charge parameter which can be
a possible indicator of extra dimensions. The analysis also supports an
asymptotically de Sitter spacetime with an estimate of the magnitude of the
cosmological constant whose origin is solely attributed to f(R) gravity in
higher dimensions.

atmospheric and ocean loss due to the superluminous pre-main-sequence phase of
their host stars, which may leave behind abiotically-generated oxygen, a false
positive for the detection of life. Determining if ocean loss has occurred will
help assess potential habitability and whether or not any O2 detected is
biogenic. In the solar system, differences in isotopic abundances have been
used to infer the history of ocean loss and atmospheric escape (e.g. Venus,
Mars). We find that isotopologue measurements using transit transmission
spectra of terrestrial planets around late-type M dwarfs like TRAPPIST-1 may be
possible with JWST, if the escape mechanisms and resulting isotopic
fractionation were similar to Venus. We present analyses of post-ocean-loss O2-
and CO2-dominated atmospheres, containing a range of trace gas abundances.
Isotopologue bands are likely detectable throughout the near-infrared (1-8 um),
especially 3-4 um, although not in CO2-dominated atmospheres. For Venus-like
D/H ratios 100 times that of Earth, TRAPPIST-1 b transit signals of up to 79
ppm are possible by observing HDO. Similarly, 18O/16O ratios 100 times that of
Earth produce signals at up to 94 ppm. Detection at S/N=5 may be attained on
these bands with as few as four to eleven transits, with optimal use of JWST
NIRSpec Prism. Consequently, H2O and CO2 isotopologues could be considered as
indicators of past ocean loss and atmospheric escape for JWST observations of
terrestrial planets around M dwarfs.

obtain upper bounds for the rates of convergence of global empirical risk
minimizers (ERMs), in standard settings such as density estimation and
regression. The upper bound for the convergence rates thus obtained typically
matches the minimax lower bound when the entropy integral converges, but admits
a strict gap compared to the lower bound when it diverges. Birg\'e and Massart
[BM93] provided a striking example showing that such a gap is real with the
entropy structure alone: for a variant of the natural H\""older class with low
regularity, the global ERM actually converges at the rate predicted by the
entropy integral that substantially deviates from the lower bound. The
counter-example has spawned a long-standing negative position on the use of
global ERMs in the regime where the entropy integral diverges, as they are
heuristically believed to converge at a sub-optimal rate in a variety of
models.
  The present paper demonstrates that this gap can be closed if the models
admit certain degree of `set structures' in addition to the entropy structure.
In other words, the global ERMs in such set structured models will indeed be
rate-optimal, matching the lower bound even when the entropy integral diverges.
The models with set structures we investigate include (i) image and edge
estimation, (ii) binary classification, (iii) multiple isotonic regression,
(iv) $s$-concave density estimation, all in general dimensions when the entropy
integral diverges. Here set structures are interpreted broadly in the sense
that the complexity of the underlying models can be essentially captured by the
size of the empirical process over certain class of measurable sets, for which
matching upper and lower bounds are obtained to facilitate the derivation of
sharp convergence rates for the associated global ERMs.

multisource data and tap the wisdom of experts. At the voting layer, a sparse
autoencoder is trained for feature learning to reduce the correlation of
attributes and diversify the base classifiers ultimately. At the stacking
layer, a nonlinear feature-weighted method based on deep belief networks is
proposed to rank the base classifiers which may violate the conditional
independence. Neural network is used as meta classifier. At the optimizing
layer, under-sampling and threshold-moving are used to cope with cost-sensitive
problem. Optimized predictions are obtained based on ensemble of probabilistic
predictions by similarity calculation. The proposed deep ensemble learning
framework is used for Alzheimers disease classification. Experiments with the
clinical dataset from national Alzheimers coordinating center demonstrate that
the classification accuracy of our proposed framework is 4% better than 6
well-known ensemble approaches as well as the standard stacking algorithm.
Adequate coverage of more accurate diagnostic services can be provided by
utilizing the wisdom of averaged physicians. This paper points out a new way to
boost the primary care of Alzheimers disease from the view of machine learning.

distances weighting of informative pairs. The general pair-based weighting loss
includes two main aspects, (1) samples mining and (2) pairs weighting. Samples
mining aims at selecting the informative positive and negative pair sets to
exploit the structured relationship of samples in a mini-batch and also reduce
the number of non-trivial pairs. Pair weighting aims at assigning different
weights for different pairs according to the pair distances for
discriminatively training the network. We detailedly review those existing
pair-based losses inline with our general loss function, and explore some
possible methods from the perspective of samples mining and pairs weighting.
Finally, extensive experiments on three image retrieval datasets show that our

the robustness of a visible watermark to an attack is shown to be essential. To
evaluate and improve the effectiveness of watermark, watermark removal attracts
increasing attention and becomes a hot research top. Current methods cast the
watermark removal as an image-to-image translation problem where the
encode-decode architectures with pixel-wise loss are adopted to transfer the
transparent watermarked pixels into unmarked pixels. However, when a number of
realistic images are presented, the watermarks are more likely to be unknown
and diverse (i.e., the watermarks might be opaque or semi-transparent; the
category and pattern of watermarks are unknown). When applying existing methods
to the real-world scenarios, they mostly can not satisfactorily reconstruct the
hidden information obscured under the complex and various watermarks (i.e., the
residual watermark traces remain and the reconstructed images lack reality). To
address this difficulty, in this paper, we present a new watermark processing
framework using the conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) for
visible watermark removal in the real-world application. The proposed method
enables the watermark removal solution to be more closed to the photo-realistic
reconstruction using a patch-based discriminator conditioned on the watermarked
images, which is adversarially trained to differentiate the difference between
the recovered images and original watermark-free images. Extensive experimental
results on a large-scale visible watermark dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method and clearly indicate that our proposed
approach can produce more photo-realistic and convincing results compared with
the state-of-the-art methods.

been reported or have no effective upper-limits in the X-ray bands, we analyze
the Swift/XRT data for 21 objects, where 6 objects are newly observed and 15
objects are taken from the archival data. As a result, we have new $3\sigma$
upper-limits for all the 21 objects. Since the upper-limits are tight, we
conclude that we do not find any magnetar-like high-B PSRs such as PSR
J1819$-$1458. The probability of the high X-ray efficiency in the high-B PSRs
is obtained to be $11\%-29\%$. Combining the previous observations, we discuss
which parameter causes magnetar-like properties. It may be suggested that the
magnetar-like properties appear only when ${\it B_{\rm d}}\gtrsim10^{13.5}$ G
for the radio pulsar population. This is true even if the radio-quiet high-B
RPP are included.

of multi-turn dialogue. Using BERT, a pre-training language model, has been
successful for single-turn machine comprehension, while modeling multiple turns
of question answering with BERT has not been established because BERT has a
limit on the number and the length of input sequences. In this paper, we
propose a simple but effective method with BERT for CMC. Our method uses BERT
to encode a paragraph independently conditioned with each question and each
answer in a multi-turn context. Then, the method predicts an answer on the
basis of the paragraph representations encoded with BERT. The experiments with
representative CMC datasets, QuAC and CoQA, show that our method outperformed
recently published methods (+0.8 F1 on QuAC and +2.1 F1 on CoQA). In addition,
we conducted a detailed analysis of the effects of the number and types of
dialogue history on the accuracy of CMC, and we found that the gold answer
history, which may not be given in an actual conversation, contributed to the
model performance most on both datasets.

lead to the spin Hall angles around 0.2; these sizable values are obtained for

torque acting on the black hole, and compute the alignment and precession
time-scales for both persistent and transient accretors. In our analysis, we
consider the contribution of the inner disc, as it can stay misaligned with the
black hole spin for a reasonable range of parameter values. We find that the

critical Kerr parameter value, contrary to earlier predictions. Besides, the
time-scales are generally longer for transience than the time-scales calculated
for persistent accretion. From our analysis of the transient case, we find that
the black hole in the low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) 4U 1543-47 could be
misaligned, whereas that in the LMXB XTE J1550-564 has aligned itself with the
outer disc. The age of the LMXB H 1743-322 is estimated assuming a misaligned

partly to the discrete nature of text, partly to the problem of ensuring that
the adversarial examples are still probable and interpretable, and partly to
the problem of maintaining label invariance under input perturbations. In order
to address some of these challenges, we introduce sparse projected gradient
descent (SPGD), a new approach to crafting interpretable adversarial examples

perturbations by projecting them onto the directions to nearby word embeddings
with highest cosine similarities. This constraint ensures that perturbations
move each word embedding in an interpretable direction (i.e., towards another
nearby word embedding). Moreover, SPGD imposes a sparsity constraint on
perturbations at the sentence level by ignoring word-embedding perturbations
whose norms are below a certain threshold. This constraint ensures that our
method changes only a few words per sequence, leading to higher quality
adversarial examples. Our experiments with the IMDB movie review dataset show

definition on abundance estimate is proved to be remarkable, particularly for
the cQGs and cSFGs at high redshifts. Regardless of the compactness criteria
adopted, their overall redshift evolutions of fractional abundance and number
density are found to be rather similar. Large samples of the cQGs exhibit a
sustaining increase in number density from $z \sim 3$ to 2 and a plateau at
$1<z<2$. For massive cSFGs, a plateau in the number density at $2<z<3$ can be
found, as well as a continuous drop from $z \sim 2$ to 1. The evolutionary

probabilistic models via Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and its
extension, the Conditional GAN (CGAN). Excellent solutions have been
demonstrated mostly in image processing applications which involve large,
continuous output spaces. There is almost no application of these powerful
tools to problems having small dimensional output spaces. Regression problems
involving the inductive learning of a map, $y=f(x,z)$, $z$ denoting noise,
$f:\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$, with $m$ small
(e.g., $m=1$ or just a few) is one good case in point. The standard approach to
solve regression problems is to probabilistically model the output $y$ as the
sum of a mean function $m(x)$ and a noise term $z$; it is also usual to take
the noise to be a Gaussian. These are done for convenience sake so that the
likelihood of observed data is expressible in closed form. In the real world,
on the other hand, stochasticity of the output is usually caused by missing or
noisy input variables. Such a real world situation is best represented using an
implicit model in which an extra noise vector, $z$ is included with $x$ as
input. CGAN is naturally suited to design such implicit models. This paper
makes the first step in this direction and compares the existing regression
methods with CGAN.
  We notice however, that the existing methods like mixture density networks
(MDN) and XGBoost do quite well compared to CGAN in terms of likelihood and
mean absolute error, respectively. Both these methods are comparatively easier
to train than CGANs. CGANs need more innovation to have a comparable modeling
and ease-of-training with respect to the existing regression solvers. In
summary, for modeling uncertainty MDNs are better while XGBoost is better for
the cases where accurate prediction is more important.

processes aided by enzymes. Performance of these enzymes is usually
characterized in terms of their average error rate and speed. However, because
of thermal fluctuations in these single-molecule processes, both error and
speed are inherently stochastic quantities. In this paper, we study
fluctuations of error and speed in biopolymer synthesis and show that they are
in general correlated. This means that, under equal conditions, polymers that
are synthesized faster due to a fluctuation tend to have either better or worse
errors than the average. The error-correction mechanism implemented by the
enzyme determines which of the two cases holds. For example, discrimination in
the forward reaction rates tends to grant smaller errors to polymers with
faster synthesis. The opposite occurs for discrimination in monomer rejection
rates. Our results provide an experimentally feasible way to identify
error-correction mechanisms by measuring the error-speed correlations.

Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO), the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM), and now Fermi.
Though Fermi/Large Area Space Telescope (LAT) has identified dozens of flares
with LDGRF signature, the nature of this phenomenon has been a challenge to
explain both due to the extreme energies and long durations. The highest-energy
emission has generally been attributed to pion production from the interaction
of >300 MeV protons with the ambient matter. The extended duration suggests
that particle acceleration occurs over large volumes extending high in the
corona, either from stochastic acceleration within large coronal loops or from
back precipitation from coronal mass ejection driven shocks. It is possible to
test these models by making direct comparison between the properties of the
accelerated ion population producing the gamma-ray emission derived from the
Fermi/LAT observations, and the characteristics of solar energetic particles
(SEPs) measured by the Payload for Matter-Antimatter Exploration and Light
Nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) spacecraft in the energy range corresponding to
the pion-related emission detected with Fermi. For fourteen of these events we
compare the two populations -- SEPs in space and the interacting particles at

analysis shows that the two proton numbers are poorly correlated, with their
ratio spanning more than five orders of magnitude, suggesting that the back
precipitation of shock-acceleration particles is unlikely the source of the

these applications typically contain contextual information that can guide the
learning process which, however, is ignored by most of existing work. To
utilize this information, we associate each arm with a context vector and
assume the reward follows the generalized linear model (GLM). We adopt the
notion of Pareto regret to evaluate the learner's performance and develop a
novel algorithm for minimizing it. The essential idea is to apply a variant of
the online Newton step to estimate model parameters, based on which we utilize
the upper confidence bound (UCB) policy to construct an approximation of the
Pareto front, and then uniformly at random choose one arm from the approximate
Pareto front. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed algorithm achieves
an $\tilde O(d\sqrt{T})$ Pareto regret, where $T$ is the time horizon and $d$

overfitting due to its huge amounts of parameters and the insufficiency of
labeled training data. (2) privacy leakage: the model trained using a
conventional method may involuntarily reveal the private information of the
patients in the training dataset. The smaller the dataset, the worse the
privacy leakage. To tackle the above two challenges, we introduce a novel
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) scheme, named patient privacy preserving SGD
(P3SGD), which performs the model update of the SGD in the patient level via a
large-step update built upon each patient's data. Specifically, to protect
privacy and regularize the CNN model, we propose to inject the well-designed
noise into the updates. Moreover, we equip our P3SGD with an elaborated
strategy to adaptively control the scale of the injected noise. To validate the
effectiveness of P3SGD, we perform extensive experiments on a real-world
clinical dataset and quantitatively demonstrate the superior ability of P3SGD
in reducing the risk of overfitting. We also provide a rigorous analysis of the
privacy cost under differential privacy. Additionally, we find that the models

reproducible experiments at scale. We instrument immersive three-dimensional
environments to simulate challenges such as urban driving, off-road trail
traversal, and battle. Our main finding is that computer vision does matter.
Models equipped with intermediate representations train faster, achieve higher
task performance, and generalize better to previously unseen environments. A

Instead of attempting to learn all modes, we argue that in many tasks it is
sufficient to imitate any one of them. We show that the state-of-the-art
methods such as GAIL and behavior cloning, due to their choice of loss
function, often incorrectly interpolate between such modes. Our key insight is
to minimize the right divergence between the learner and the expert
state-action distributions, namely the reverse KL divergence or I-projection.
We propose a general imitation learning framework for estimating and minimizing
any f-Divergence. By plugging in different divergences, we are able to recover
existing algorithms such as Behavior Cloning (Kullback-Leibler), GAIL (Jensen
Shannon) and Dagger (Total Variation). Empirical results show that our
approximate I-projection technique is able to imitate multi-modal behaviors
more reliably than GAIL and behavior cloning.

hierarchical representation which communicates these views across layers, while
disentangling the supervision. Disentanglement of supervision leads learned
features to be independent conditionally to the label. In case of binary
features, we show that conditional independence allows to extract label's
information with a linear model and therefore helps to solve under-fitting. We
suppose that representations displaying multiple views help to solve
over-fitting because each view provides information that helps to reduce

Furthermore, we show that AlignFlow guarantees exact cycle consistency in
mapping datapoints from a source domain to target and back to the source

simultaneously interpolate across the various domains using the learned

regularization terms penalize the cumulative warping and the instantaneous rate

accumulate dust. Moreover, some of them are expected to lead to the
multiple-ring structure formation and the planetesimal formation in
protoplanetary disks. In a turbulent gaseous disk, the growth of the
instabilities and the dust accumulation are quenched by turbulent diffusion of
dust grains. The diffusion process has been often modeled by a diffusion term
in the continuity equation for the dust density. The dust diffusion model,
however, does not guarantee the angular momentum conservation in a disk. In
this study, we first formulate equations that describe the dust diffusion and
also conserve the total angular momentum of a disk. Second, we perform the
linear perturbation analysis on the secular gravitational instability (GI)
using the equations. The results show that the secular GI is a monotonically
growing mode, contrary to the result of previous analyses that found it
overstable. We find that the overstability is caused by the non-conservation of
the angular momentum. Third, we find a new axisymmetric instability due to the
combination of the dust-gas friction and the turbulent gas viscosity, which we
refer to as two-component viscous gravitational instability (TVGI). The most
unstable wavelength of TVGI is comparable to or smaller than the gas scale
height. TVGI accumulates dust grains efficiently, which indicates that TVGI is
a promising mechanism for the formation of multiple-ring-like structures and
planetesimals. Finally, we examine the validity of the ring formation via the
secular GI and TVGI in the HL Tau disk and find both instabilities can create
multiple rings whose width is about 10 au at orbital radii larger than 50 au.

equations with and without surface tension. The local well-posedness, the
global well-posedness, and asymptotics of solutions as time goes to infinity
are studied in the Lp in time and Lq in space framework. The tool in proving
the local well-posedness is the maximal Lp-Lq regularity for the Stokes
equations with non-homogeneous free boundary conditions. The approach here of
proving the maximal Lp-Lq regularity is based on the R bounded solution
operators of the generalized resolvent problem for the Stokes equations with
non-homogeneous free boundary conditions and the Weis operator valued Fourier
multiplier.
  The key issue of proving the global well-posedness for the strong solutions
is the decay properties of Stokes semigroup, which are derived by spectral
analysis of the Stokes operator in the bulk space and the Laplace-Beltrami
operator on the boundary. In this lecture note, we study the following two
cases: (1) a bounded domain with surface tension and (2) an exterior domain
without surface tension. In particular, in studying the exterior domain case,
it is essential to choose different exponents p and q. Because, in the
unbounded domain case, we can obtain only polynomial decay in suitable Lq norms
in space, and so to guarantee the integrability of Lp norm of solutions in
time, it is necessary to have freedom to choose an exponent with respect to

optics due to their ability to continuously modulate the phase of a light field
with very high spatial resolution. A common problem in these devices is the
pixel crosstalk, also called the fringing field effect, which causes the
response of these devices to deviate from the ideal behavior. This fringing
effect decreases the performance of the spatial light modulator and is shown to
cause an asymmetry in the diffraction efficiency between positive and negative
diffraction orders. We use simulations of the director distribution to
reproduce diffraction efficiency measurements of binary and blazed gratings. To
overcome these limitations in performance, the simulations of the director
distribution in the liquid crystal layer are used to develop a fast and precise
model to compute the phase response of the spatial light modulator. To
compensate the fringing field effect, we implement this model in phase
retrieval algorithms and calculate the phase profile corresponding to a regular
spot pattern as a generic example. With this method, we are able to increase
the spot uniformity significantly compared to a calculation without considering
the fringing field effect. Additionally, polarization conversion efficiencies
of various simple phase patterns are simulated and measured for different
orientations of the spatial light modulator. We found that the polarization
conversion has the the smallest effect for a setup in which the liquid crystal
molecules at the alignment layer lie in the plane of incidence of the light

zero-frequency limit of the noise spectrum and as an answer to the divergent
issue on the 1/f^n noises. As a result, arsenic nuclear spins are found to
exhibit 1/f2 dependences over two orders of magnitude in all the substrates of
un-doped, Cr-doped semi-insulating and Si-doped metallic GaAs at 297 K. The
1/f^2 dependence indicates single noise source that is characterized by the
characteristic frequency f_c_^un^=170 Hz, f_c_^Cr^=210 Hz and f_c_^Si^ =460 Hz.
These f_c values are explained by a model that the decoherence is caused by the
fluctuations of next-nearest-neighboring nuclear spins.

timestamps to detect the information source in a network. The problem incurs
prohibitive cost under canonical maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the
source due to the exponential number of possible infection paths. Our main idea
of source detection, however, is to approximate the MLE by an alternative
infection path based estimator, the essence of which is to identify the most
likely infection path that is consistent with observed timestamps. The source
node associated with that infection path is viewed as the estimated source
$\hat{v}$. We first study the case of tree topology, where by transforming the
infection path based estimator into a linear integer programming, we find a
reduced search region that remarkably improves the time efficiency. Within this
reduced search region, the estimator $\hat{v}$ is provably always on a path
which we term as \emph{candidate path}. This notion enables us to analyze the
distribution of $d(v^{\ast},\hat{v})$, the error distance between $\hat{v}$ and
the true source $v^{\ast}$, on arbitrary tree, which allows us to obtain for
the first time, in the literature provable performance guarantee of the
estimator under limited timestamps. Specifically, on the infinite $g$-regular
tree with uniform sampled timestamps, we get a refined performance guarantee in
the sense of a constant bounded $d(v^{\ast},\hat{v})$. By virtue of time
labeled BFS tree, the estimator still performs fairly well when extended to
more general graphs. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets further
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithms.

boolean circuits of super-linear size is a major frontier in complexity theory.
While such lower bounds are known for larger complexity classes, existing
results only show that the corresponding problems are hard on infinitely many
input lengths. For instance, proving almost-everywhere circuit lower bounds is
open even for problems in $\mathsf{MAEXP}$. Giving the notorious difficulty of
proving lower bounds that hold for all large input lengths, we ask the
following question: Can we show that a large set of techniques cannot prove
that $\mathsf{NP}$ is easy infinitely often? Motivated by this and related
questions about the interaction between mathematical proofs and computations,
we investigate circuit complexity from the perspective of logic.
  Among other results, we prove that for any parameter $k \geq 1$ it is
consistent with theory $T$ that computational class ${\mathcal C} \not

${\mathcal C} = \mathsf{P}$. In other words, these theories cannot establish
infinitely often circuit upper bounds for the corresponding problems. This is
of interest because the weaker theory $\mathsf{PV}$ already formalizes
sophisticated arguments, such as a proof of the PCP Theorem. These consistency
statements are unconditional and improve on earlier theorems of [KO17] and

Representation, Intrinsic Sequences, and Pattern completion) of the hippocampus
that allows to continuously store pattern sequences online in a one-shot
fashion. Rather than storing a sequence in CA3, CA3 provides a pre-trained
sequence that is hetero-associated with the input sequence, which allows the
system to perform one-shot learning. Plasticity on a short time scale therefore
only happens in the incoming and outgoing connections of CA3. Stored sequences
can later be recalled from a single cue pattern. We identify the pattern
separation performed by subregion DG to be necessary for storing sequences that
contain correlated patterns. A design principle of the model is that we use a
single learning rule named Hebbiand-escent to train all parts of the system.
Hebbian-descent has an inherent forgetting mechanism that allows the system to
continuously memorize new patterns while forgetting early stored ones. The
model shows a plausible behavior when noisy and new patterns are presented and
has a rather high capacity of about 40% in terms of the number of neurons in
CA3. One notable property of our model is that it is capable of
`boot-strapping' (improving) itself without external input in a process we
refer to as `dreaming'. Besides artificially generated input sequences we also
show that the model works with sequences of encoded handwritten digits or
natural images. To our knowledge this is the first model of the hippocampus
that allows to store correlated pattern sequences online in a one-shot fashion
without a consolidation process, which can instantaneously be recalled later.

parallel with shared data and (iii) distributed with partitioned data. For
single machine case, we generalize the previous analysis of signSGD relying on
intuitive bounds on success probabilities and allowing even biased estimators.
Furthermore, we extend the analysis to parallel setting within a parameter
server framework, where exponentially fast noise reduction is guaranteed with
respect to number of nodes, maintaining $1$-bit compression in both directions
and using small mini-batch sizes. Next, we identify a fundamental issue with
signSGD to converge in distributed environment. To resolve this issue, we
propose a new sign-based method, {\em Stochastic Sign Descent with Momentum
(SSDM)}, which converges under standard bounded variance assumption with the
optimal asymptotic rate. We validate several aspects of our theoretical
findings with numerical experiments.

reveal a quantitative and precise dependence of the accessible dark matter
annihilation cross-sections on the dark matter density profiles of dSphs and on
the distance to them. In most data analyses, researchers have assumed
point-like signals from dSphs because it is difficult to resolve the expected
emission profiles with current gamma-ray observatories. In future however, CTA
will be able to resolve the peak emission profiles in dSphs. We take several
variations of the dark matter density profile of Draco dSph as examples and
analyze the simulated observations of with CTA. We derive the accessible region
of the dark matter annihilation cross-section with each dark matter density
profile. The accessible region of the annihilation cross-section can differ by
a factor of 10 among plausible profiles. We also examine the dependence on the
distance to the target dSphs by assuming the same profiles of dSphs at
different distances. Closer targets are better due to the higher J-factor,
while their spatial extension significantly degrades our reach to the
annihilation cross-section compared to the value expected from a simple
distance-scaling of the J-factor. Spatial extension of the source affects the
probable parameter region in energy-dependent ways. In some gamma-ray energy
ranges, this behaviour becomes moderately dependent on the properties of the
observation facility.

be an obstacle. Hence, two total and strict spatial heap operations are
proposed upon heap graphs, for conjunction and disjunction -- similar to
logical conjuncts. Heap conjunction implies that there exists a free heap
vertex to connect to or an explicit destination vertex is provided.
Essentially, Burstall's properties do not change. By heap we refer to an
arbitrary simple directed graph, which is finite and may contain composite
vertices representing class objects. Arbitrary heap memory access is
restricted, as well as type punning, late class binding and further
restrictions. Properties of the new logic are investigated, and as a result
group properties are shown. Both expecting and superficial heaps are
specifiable. Equivalence transformations may make denotated heaps inconsistent,
although those may be detected and patched by the two generic linear
canonization steps presented. The properties help to motivate a later full
introduction of a set of equivalences over heap for future work. Partial heaps
are considered as a useful specification technique that help to reduce
incompleteness issues with specifications. Finally, the logic proposed may be
considered for extension for the Object Constraint Language.

has been widely used for solving large-scale machine learning problems. Due to
the latency and limited bandwidth of network, communication has become the
bottleneck of DSGD when we need to train large scale models, like deep neural
networks. Communication compression with sparsified gradient, abbreviated as
\emph{sparse communication}, has been widely used for reducing communication
cost in DSGD. Recently, there has appeared one method, called deep gradient
compression~(DGC), to combine memory gradient and momentum SGD for sparse
communication. DGC has achieved promising performance in practise. However, the
theory about the convergence of DGC is lack. In this paper, we propose a novel
method, called \emph{\underline{g}}lobal \emph{\underline{m}}omentum
\emph{\underline{c}}ompression~(GMC), for sparse communication in DSGD. GMC
also combines memory gradient and momentum SGD. But different from DGC which
adopts local momentum, GMC adopts global momentum. We theoretically prove the
convergence rate of GMC for both convex and non-convex problems. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work that proves the convergence of
distributed momentum SGD~(DMSGD) with sparse communication and memory gradient.
Empirical results show that, compared with the DMSGD counterpart without sparse
communication, GMC can reduce the communication cost by approximately 100 fold
without loss of generalization accuracy. GMC can also achieve
comparable~(sometimes better) performance compared with DGC, with extra
theoretical guarantee.

prompted major banks to deploy two-factor authentication. However, the
importance of the `integrity' of the web content has received little attention.
We implement two attacks on real-world online banking websites and show that
ignoring the `integrity' of the web content can fundamentally defeat two-factor
solutions. To address this problem, we propose a cryptographic protocol called
DOMtegrity to ensure the end-to-end integrity of the DOM structure of a web
page from delivering at a web server to the rendering of the page in the user's
browser. DOMtegrity is the first solution that protects DOM integrity without
modifying the browser architecture or requiring extra hardware. It works by
exploiting subtle yet important differences between browser extensions and
in-line JavaScript code. We show how DOMtegrity prevents the earlier attacks
and a whole range of man-in-the-browser (MITB) attacks. We conduct extensive
experiments on more than 14,000 real-world extensions to evaluate the

used to estimate the mutual information. We argue that the seemingly redundant
intermediate step of entropy estimation allows one to improve the convergence

reduces to MINE in the special case when the reference distribution is the
product of marginal distributions, but faster convergence is possible by
choosing the uniform distribution as the reference distribution instead.
Compared to the product of marginals, the uniform distribution introduces more
samples in low-density regions and fewer samples in high-density regions, which
appear to lead to an overall larger gradient for faster convergence.

transformation equation describes the relation between traditional DSGD and
M-DSGD so that we can transform M-DSGD to its corresponding DSGD. Hence we get
the convergence rate of M-DSGD with momentum for both convex and non-convex

learning rate of M-DSGD in each stage is a constant and is decreased by stage,

expressive power, and have been successfully applied to a variety of machine

matrix into user and item latent factors continue to be a method of choice for
collaborative filtering tasks due to their great performance. While deep
learning based approaches excel in hybrid recommender tasks where additional
features for items, users or even context are available, their flexibility
seems to rather impair the performance compared to low-rank approximations for
pure collaborative filtering tasks where no additional features are used.
Recent works propose hybrid models combining low-rank approximations and
traditional deep neural architectures with promising results but fail to
explain why neural networks alone are unsuitable for this task. In this work,
we revisit the model and intuition behind low-rank approximation to point out
its suitability for collaborative filtering tasks. In several experiments we
compare the performance and behavior of models based on a deep neural network

traditional deep neural networks. We conclude that the universal approximation

determination of suitable latent vectors, leading to a worse performance

specific structure that is inherent in all these inferences: they admit a
general recursive decomposition. This allows us to achieve a computational
complexity that scales linearly in the number of time points on which the
inference depends, instead of the exponential scaling that is typical for a

B-factories Belle II and BESIII, the LHCb and PANDA experiments and at a future
Super-c-tau Factory. Precise lattice calculations provide valuable input and
several results have been obtained by simulating up, down and strange quarks in
the sea. We investigate the impact of a charm quark in the sea on the
charmonium spectrum, the renormalization group invariant charm-quark mass and
the scalar charm-quark content of charmonium. The latter is obtained by the
direct computation of the mass-derivatives of the charmonium masses. We do this
investigation in a model, QCD with two degenerate charm quarks. The absence of
light quarks allows us to reach very small lattice spacings down to 0.023 fm.
By comparing to pure gauge theory we find that charm quarks in the sea affect
the hyperfine splitting at a level below 2%. The most significant effects are
5% in the quark mass and 3% in the value of the charm quark content of the
eta_c meson. Given that we simulate two charm quarks these estimates are upper
bounds for the contribution of a single charm quark. We show that lattice
spacings <0.06 fm are needed for safe continuum extrapolations of the
charmonium spectrum with O(a) improved Wilson quarks. A useful relation for the
projection to the desired parity of operators in two-point functions computed
with twisted mass fermions is proven.

offloading strategy and dense point cloud map construction method is proposed
in this paper. First, we develop a novel strategy to remotely offload

originally be achieved locally on the resource-limited robot systems become
possible. Second, a modified iterative closest point algorithm (ICP), named
fitness score hierarchical ICP algorithm (FS-HICP), is developed to accelerate
point cloud registration. The correctness, efficiency, and scalability of the
proposed strategy are evaluated with both theoretical analysis and experimental

transport-reaction processes in an essentially water-saturated porous medium
that are coupled to thermodynamic phase transitions between solid gas hydrates,
free gas and dissolved methane in the aqueous phase. These phase transitions
are highly nonlinear and strongly coupled, and cause the mathematical model to
rapidly switch the phase states and pose serious convergence issues for the
classical Newton's method. One of the common methods of dealing with such phase
transitions is the primary variable switching (PVS) method where the choice of
the primary variables is adapted locally to the phase state **outside** the
Newton loop. In order to ensure that the phase states are determined
accurately, the PVS strategy requires an additional iterative loop, which can
get quite expensive for highly nonlinear problems. For methane hydrate
reservoir models, the PVS method shows poor convergence behaviour and often
leads to extremely small time step sizes. In order to overcome this issue, we
have developed a nonlinear complementary constraints method (NCP) for handling
phase transitions, and implemented it within a non-smooth Newton's
linearization scheme using an active-set strategy. Here, we present our
numerical scheme and show its robustness through field scale applications based
on the highly dynamic geological setting of the Black Sea.

emission has a radius of 250 au, surrounded by the infalling rotating envelope
traced by thermal CH$_3$OH lines. This disk radius is consistent with the
centrifugal radius estimated from the specific angular momentum in the
envelope. The lower-limit envelope mass is $\sim$5-7 M$_{\odot}$ and accretion
rate onto the stellar surface is 3 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ or
higher. The expected stellar age is well younger than 10$^{4}$ yr, indicating
that the host object is one of the youngest high-mass objects at present. The
disk mass is 2-7 M$_{\odot}$, depending on the dust opacity index. The
estimated Toomre's $Q$ parameter is typically 1-2 and can reach 0.4 at the

energy gap inside the domain regions making them insulating, marginally-twisted
BLG is predicted to remain conductive due to a triangular network of chiral
one-dimensional (1D) states hosted by domain boundaries. Here we study electron
transport through this network and report giant Aharonov-Bohm oscillations
persisting to temperatures above 100 K. At liquid helium temperatures, the

around the kinematical aspects of quantum entanglement and the improper quantum
mixtures. In this paper, we introduce and argue for the foundational character
of the question of dynamics of quantum subsystems (open quantum systems). In
this context, for some typical and physically relevant Markovian processes, we
technically prove non-existence of trajectories in the Hilbert state space of
the open system. As a kind of no-go theorem for the unitary-only quantum
theory, this finding suggests that the mixed quantum states may be joined to
the individual (single) quantum subsystem dynamically described by the
corresponding master equation. Then the problem of interpretation of improper
mixtures dissolves while description of quantum measurement boils down to the
problem of reduction of the mixed to the pure states-i.e. to the problem of
actualization of definite values of certain observables of the single open
systems, thus tackling the mathematical problem of interpreting probability for
the single trials of an experiment. This kind of indeterminism may be the
furthest we can go within the dynamical approach to quantum subsystems. As an
alternative appears the possibility that the idea of dynamics of quantum
subsystems may not be viable in the context of the unitary-only theory. As a
direct consequence of our main finding appears the a priori impossibility to
define ""quantum history"" in the Hilbert state space for the considered

where $n$ is the length of the text and $\sigma$ is the alphabet size. Our
result improves the previous best space requirement for linear time computation

working space in addition to the Lyndon array and suffix array. Experimental
results with real and synthetic datasets show that our algorithm is not only
space-efficient but also fast in practice.

to reconstruct the 3D shape of a whole stomach with color texture information

spreading indigo carmine (IC) dye on the stomach surface.

graphene, the lattice thermal conductivity of the superlattice structure is
more than two orders of magnitude lower due to the enhanced three-phonon

coexistence of light and heavy bands around the Fermi level leads to an
ultrahigh power factor along the zigzag direction, where the highest ZT value
of ~2.5 can be achieved for the n-type system at 1100 K. Moreover, it is noted
that the carrier transport near the valance band minimum is almost entirely
contributed by the graphene part of the superlattice. As a consequence, the
thermoelectric performance of p-type system can be enhanced to be comparable
with that of n-type one by appropriate substitution of nitrogen atom with
phosphorus, which can suppress the lattice thermal conductivity but nearly have

characterize a significant sample of NEAs with sizes in the range of $\sim$0.25
- 5.5 km (categorized as large), and search for connections between their
spectral types and the orbital parameters. Optical spectra of NEAs were
obtained using the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) equipped with the IDS
spectrograph. These observations are analyzed using taxonomic classification

NEAs were observed. We classified 44 of them as Q/S-complex, 16 as B/C-complex,
eight as V-types, and another eight belong to the remaining taxonomic classes.

We explain these observational evidences by thermal fatigue fragmentation as
the main process for the rejuvenation of NEA surfaces. In general terms, the
taxonomic distribution of our sample is similar to the previous studies and
matches the broad groups of the inner main belt asteroids. Nevertheless, we
found a wide diversity of spectra compared to the standard taxonomic types.

can be estimated by the pace of finding explanations for previous research
questions. In this observers based view of stellar pulsation and
asteroseismology, we start with the earliest observations of variable stars and
the techniques used to observe them. The earliest variable stars were large
amplitude, radial pulsators but were followed by other classes of pulsating
stars. As the field matured, we outline some cornerstones of research into
pulsating star research with an emphasis on changes in observational
techniques. Improvements from photographs, to photometry, CCDs, and space
telescopes allowed researchers to separate out pulsating stars from other stars
with light variations, recognize radial and nonradial pulsation courtesy of
increased measurement precision, and then use nonradial pulsations to look
inside the stars, which cannot be done any other way. We follow several
highlighted problems to show that even with excellent space data, there still
may not be quick theoretical explanations. As the result of technical changes,
the structure of international organizations devoted to pulsating stars has
changed, and an increasing number of conferences specialized to space missions
or themes are held. Although there are still many unsolved problems, such as
mode identification in non-asymptotic pulsating stars, the large amount of data
with unprecedented precision provided by space missions (MOST, CoRoT, Kepler)
and upcoming missions allow us to use asteroseismology to its full potential.
However, the enormous flow of data will require new techniques to extract the
science before the next missions. The future of asteroseismology will be
successful if we learn from the past and improve with improved techniques,
space missions, and a properly educated new generation.

moment-based statistics as well as quantiles in a sliding window can be

more binarization methods can be accelerated too. In particular, given a
$H\times W$ input image, Sauvola's method and alike can run in $\Theta (HW)$
time independent of window size, while only around $6\min\{H,W\}$ bytes of
auxiliary space is needed, which is significantly lower than the $16HW$ bytes

various well-known local adaptive binarization methods to be applied in
real-time use cases on devices with limited resources, it has the potential of

that binding energy for two nanoparticles is in the range of $9\div13~kT$

inputs (a corpus) from which to generate new inputs by mutation. A corpus of
potential seeds will often contain thousands of similar inputs. This lack of
diversity can lead to wasted fuzzing effort by exhaustive mutation from all
available seeds. To address this, fuzzers come with distillation tools (e.g.,
afl-cmin) that select the smallest subset of seeds that triggers the same range
of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice suggests
that minimizing the number and cumulative size of the seeds leads to more
efficient fuzzing, which we explore systematically.
  We present results of 34+ CPU-years of fuzzing with five distillation
approaches to understand their impact in finding bugs in real-world software.
We evaluate a number of techniques, includibng the existing afl-cmin and
Minset, and also MoonLight---a freely available, configurable,

  Our experiments compare the effectiveness of distillation approaches,
targeting the Google Fuzzer Test Suite and a diverse set of six real-world

reveal that state-of-the-art distillation tools (such as MoonLight and Minset)

observed dijet invariant mass and lepton-neutrino transverse mass spectra are
found to be consistent with the standard model predictions. Upper limits are
set on the cross sections for chargino ($\widetilde\chi_1^\pm$) and neutralino
($\widetilde\chi_2^0$) production with two associated jets. For a compressed
mass spectrum scenario in which the $\widetilde\chi_1^\pm$ and
$\widetilde\chi_2^0$ decays proceed via a light slepton and the mass difference
between the lightest neutralino $\widetilde\chi_1^0$ and the mass-degenerate

most stringent lower limit to date of 112 (215) GeV is set on the mass of these

$\widetilde{\mathcal{Q}}_1:=\widetilde A^{1/2} X \widetilde B X^* \widetilde

matrices whose spectrums consist of bulk spectrums plus several spikes, i.e.
larger eigenvalues that are separated from the bulks. Conceptually, we call
$\widetilde{\mathcal{Q}}_1$ a \emph{spiked separable covariance matrix model}.
On the one hand, this model includes the spiked covariance matrix as a special
case with $\widetilde{B}=I$. On the other hand, it allows for more general
correlations of datasets. In particular, for spatio-temporal dataset,
$\widetilde{A}$ and $\widetilde{B}$ represent the spatial and temporal
correlations, respectively.
  In this paper, we study the outlier eigenvalues and eigenvectors, i.e. the
principal components, of the spiked separable covariance model
$\widetilde{\mathcal{Q}}_1$. We prove the convergence of the outlier
eigenvalues $\widetilde \lambda_i$ and the generalized components (i.e.
$\langle \mathbf v, \widetilde{\mathbf{\xi}}_i \rangle$ for any deterministic
vector $\mathbf v$) of the outlier eigenvectors $\widetilde{\mathbf{\xi}}_i$
with optimal convergence rates. Moreover, we also prove the delocalization of
the non-outlier eigenvectors. We state our results in full generality, in the
sense that they also hold near the so-called BBP transition and for degenerate
outliers. Our results highlight both the similarity and difference between the
spiked separable covariance matrix model and the spiked covariance model. In
particular, we show that the spikes of both $\widetilde{A}$ and $\widetilde{B}$
will cause outliers of the eigenvalue spectrum, and the eigenvectors can help
us to select the outliers that correspond to the spikes of $\widetilde{A}$ (or
$\widetilde{B}$).

exactly soluble and we show that the system has a series of critical points

collective efforts performed by multiple developers with heterogeneous

explain developers' behavior in large scale-distributed projects. For example,
the propensity to trust others - a critical factor for the success of global
software engineering - has been found to influence positively the result of
code reviews in distributed projects. Method: In this paper, we perform a
quantitative analysis of ecosystem-level data from the code commits and email
messages contributed by the developers working on the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF) projects, as representative of large scale-distributed
projects. Results: We find that there are three common types of personality
profiles among Apache developers, characterized in particular by their level of
Agreeableness and Neuroticism. We also confirm that developers' personality is
stable over time. Moreover, personality traits do not vary with their role,
membership, and extent of contribution to the projects. We also find evidence
that more open developers are more likely to make contributors to Apache
projects. Conclusion: Overall, our findings reinforce the need for future
studies on human factors in software engineering to use psychometric tools to
control for differences in developers' personalities.

to determine the partial order of events in highly distributed systems. The
bloom clock, like the vector clock, can autonomously detect causality
violations by comparing its logical timestamps. Unlike the vector clock, the
space complexity of the bloom clock does not depend on the number of nodes in a

confidence interval, i.e. false positive rate. To reduce the space complexity
from which the vector clock suffers, the bloom clock uses a 'moving window' in
which the partial order of events can be inferred with high confidence. If two
clocks are not comparable, the bloom clock can always deduce it, i.e. false
negatives are not possible. If two clocks are comparable, the bloom clock can
calculate the confidence of that statement, i.e. it can compute the false
positive rate between comparable pairs of clocks. By choosing an acceptable
threshold for the false positive rate, the bloom clock can properly compare the
order of its timestamps, with that of other nodes in a highly accurate and

first stage is an alignment module that uses computed homographies between the

based on the frame similarity to fill in the target holes roughly. The second
stage is a non-local attention module that matches the generated patches with
known reference patches (in space and time) to refine the previous global
alignment stage. Both stages consist of large spatial-temporal window size for
the reference and thus enable modeling long-range correlations between distant
information and the hole regions. Therefore, even challenging scenes with large
or slowly moving holes can be handled, which have been hardly modeled by
existing flow-based approach. Our network is also designed with a recurrent
propagation stream to encourage temporal consistency in video results.
Experiments on video object removal demonstrate that our method inpaints the

discovered twelve such compounds (few of which are already synthesized before),
which are chemically, mechanically and dynamically stable. These twelve
compounds were then evaluated for their suitability for three renewable energy
applications, (i) photovoltaics, (ii) water splitting, and (iii)
thermoelectrics. Careful analysis of electronic structure reveals high optical
transition strength resulting in sharp rise in absorption. This in turn yields
high short circuit current and hence excellent solar efficiency for few
compounds namely CsVN$_2$ and RbVN$_2$. Along with excellent absorption
quality, some compounds show favorable band edge positions compared to water
redox levels and hence are promising as photoelectrodes in
photo(electro)chemical water splitting devices. Mixture of flat and dispersive
bands in the band structure yields both high Seebeck and electrical
conductivity, thus excellent power factor for seven compounds. Simulated
lattice thermal conductivity shows moderate to ultralow values and thus the
possibility of achieving high thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT), even at
lower temperatures. From the experimental perspective, we discuss the possible
challenges that may arise while utilizing these compounds for the desired
applications, and suggest possible pathways to overcome them. We believe such
theoretical prediction of promising materials are extremely useful for new

especially for certain motion-prone subjects and for data gathering of advanced
diffusion models with prolonged scan times. Deficient accuracy of motion
correction cause deterioration in the quality of diffusion model
reconstruction, thus affecting the derived measures. This results in either
loss of data, or introducing bias in outcomes from data of different motion
levels, or both. Hence minimizing motion effects and reutilizing
motion-contaminated data becomes vital to quantitative studies. We have
previously developed a 3-dimensional hierarchical convolution neural network
(3D H-CNN) for robust diffusion kurtosis mapping from under-sampled data. In
this study, we propose to extend this method to motion-contaminated data for
robust recovery of diffusion model-derived measures with a process of motion
assessment and corrupted volume rejection. We validate the proposed pipeline in
two in-vivo datasets. Results from the first dataset of individual subjects
show that all the diffusion tensor and kurtosis tensor-derived measures from
the new pipeline are minimally sensitive to motion effects, and are comparable
to the motion-free reference with as few as eight volumes retained from the
motion-contaminated data. Results from the second dataset of a group of
children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder demonstrate the ability
of our approach in ameliorating spurious group differences due to head motion.
This method shows great potential for exploiting some valuable but
motion-corrupted DWI data which are likely to be discarded otherwise, and
applying to data with different motion level thus improving their utilization

providing the flexibility to learn complex structured distributions across
scales. We demonstrate these abilities on the task of segmenting ambiguous
medical scans as well as on instance segmentation of neurobiological and
natural images. Our model automatically separates independent factors across
scales, an inductive bias that we deem beneficial in structured output
prediction tasks beyond segmentation.

aims at determining the minimum bit precision of every activation and weight
tensor given the memory constraints of a device. This is achieved through a
rule-based iterative procedure, which cuts the number of bits of the most
memory-demanding layers, aiming at meeting the memory constraints. After a
quantization-aware retraining step, the fake-quantized graph is converted into
an inference integer-only model by inserting the Integer Channel-Normalization

MobilenetV1 models. We report the latency-accuracy evaluation of
mixed-precision MobilenetV1 family networks on a STM32H7 microcontroller. Our

customer mobility flow between supermarket zones. We use anonymized, ordered
customer-basket data to infer empirical mobility flow in supermarkets, and we
apply variants of the gravity and intervening-opportunities models to fit this

the flow inside supermarkets. Using a gravity model as a case study, we then
investigate how to reduce congestion in supermarkets using mobility models. We
model each supermarket zone as a queue, and we use a gravity model to identify
store layouts with low congestion, which we measure either by the maximum
number of visits to a zone or by the total mean queue size. We then use a
simulated-annealing algorithm to find store layouts with lower congestion than
a supermarket's original layout. In these optimized store layouts, we find that
popular zones are often in the perimeter of a store. Our research gives insight
both into how customers move in supermarkets and into how retailers can arrange
stores to reduce congestion. It also provides a case study of human mobility on

characterize the capacity of this channel. We particularly consider
multiple-access systems, where transmitters dispatch encoded symbols over a
system that is a superposition of continuous-time $GI_k/GI/1$ queues. A server
receives and processes symbols in order of arrivals with queue-length dependent

  We first determine the capacity of single-user queue-length dependent

Then, the multiple-access channel capacity is obtained using point processes.
When the number of transmitters is large and each arrival process is sparse,
the superposition of arrivals approaches a Poisson point process. In
characterizing the Poisson approximation, we show that the capacity of the

data and achieving near complete confidence. We use several simple, structured
datasets with very long proofs to show that FLoP can successfully generalise a
single training proof to a large class of related problems. On these
benchmarks, FLoP is competitive with strong theorem provers despite using very
limited search, due to its ability to solve problems that are prohibitively
long for other systems.

as kinetic jets - streams of high energy particles escaping from ram-pressure
confined pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). The reconnection between the PWN and
interstellar magnetic field allows pulsar wind particles to escape, creating
long narrow features. They are the low frequency analogs of kinetic jets seen
around some fast-moving pulsars, such as The Guitar and The Lighthouse PWNe.
The radio filaments trace a population of pulsars also responsible for the
Fermi GeV excess produced by the Inverse Compton scattering by the pulsar wind
particles. The magnetic flux tubes are stretched radially by the large scale
Galactic winds. In addition to PWNe accelerated particles can be injected at
supernovae remnants. The model predicts variations of the structure of the
largest filaments on scales of $\sim$ dozens of years - smaller variations can
occur on shorter time scales. We also encourage targeted observations of the
brightest sections of the filaments and of the related unresolved point sources
in search of the powering PWNe and pulsars.

evidence for presence of giant planets with masses from $\sim 0.01$ Jupiter
mass to a few Jupiter mass with separations up to $ 100$~AU in the annular
structures observed in young protoplanetary discs. We point out that these
observations set unique ""live"" constraints on the process of gas accretion onto
sub-Jovian planets that were not previously available. Accordingly, we use a
population synthesis approach in a new way: we build time-resolved models and
compare the properties of the synthetic planets with the ALMA data at the same
age. Applying the widely used gas accretion formulae leads to a deficit of
sub-Jovian planets and an over-abundance of a few Jupiter mass planets compared
to observations. We find that gas accretion rate onto planets needs to be
suppressed by about an order of magnitude to match the observed planet mass
function. This slower gas giant growth predicts that the planet mass should
correlate positively with the age of the protoplanetary disc, albeit with a
large scatter. This effect is not clearly present in the ALMA data but may be
confirmed in the near future with more observations.

massive number of players. So far, the only known game instances in which the
problem is solved in polynomial time are some particular congestion games.
However, a complete characterization of hard and easy instances is still
lacking. In this paper, we extend the state of the art along two main
directions. First, we focus on games where players' actions are made of
multiple resources, and we prove that the problem is NP-hard and not in
Poly-APX unless P = NP, even in the basic case in which players are symmetric,
their actions are made of only two resources, and the cost functions are
monotonic. Second, we focus on games with singleton actions where the players
are partitioned into classes, depending on which actions they have available.
In this case, we provide a dynamic programming algorithm that finds an
equilibrium in polynomial time, when the number of classes is fixed and the
leader plays pure strategies. Moreover, we prove that, if we allow for leader's
mixed strategies, then the problem becomes NP-hard even with only four classes
and monotonic costs. Finally, for both settings, we provide mixed-integer
linear programming formulations, and we experimentally evaluate their
scalability on both random game instances and worst-case instances based on our
hardness reductions.

plate and a layer of water for which basal friction forces are negligible. We
observe two dynamical regimes: intermittent flow, in which the intruder moves
freely most of the time but occasionally gets stuck, and stick-slip dynamics,
in which the intruder advances via a sequence of distinct, rapid events. When
basal friction is present, we observe a smooth crossover between the two
regimes as a function of packing fraction, and we find that reducing the
interparticle friction coefficient causes the stick-slip regime to shift to
higher packing fractions. When basal friction is eliminated, we observe
intermittent flow at all accessible packing fractions. For all cases, we
present results for the statistics of stick events, the intruder velocity, and
the force exerted on the intruder by the grains. Our results indicate the

rejection-free Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, the Bouncy Particle
Sampler (BPS), is brought to bear to this problem. BPS has demonstrated its
favorable computational efficiency compared with state-of-the-art MCMC
algorithms, however to date applications to real-data scenario were scarce. An
important aspect of the practical implementation of BPS is the simulation of
event times. Default implementations use conservative thinning bounds. Such
bounds can slow down the algorithm and limit the computational performance. Our
paper develops an algorithm with an exact analytical solution to the random
event times in the context of CTMCs. Our local version of BPS algorithm takes
advantage of the sparse structure in the target factor graph and we also
provide a framework for assessing the computational complexity of local BPS

when it is probable that the change is beneficial. In cases that a policy is a
threshold on contextual variables we can estimate treatment effects for
populations lying at the threshold. This allows for a schedule of incremental
policy updates that let us optimize a policy while making few detrimental

present a conservative policy updating procedure which updates a deterministic

makes far fewer changes to its policy and, of those changes, fewer are

dual-species two-qubit gates, based on the Moelmer-Soerensen interaction and

fidelity of generated entangled states; we achieve fidelities of 98.8(2)% and
97.5(2)% in Ca+ - Ca+ and Sr+ - Sr+ gates, respectively. For a similar Ca+ -

autonomous agents might acquire and predict behavioral and mental states of

agent model the goals, beliefs, and actions of other agents it interacts with?
What are the computational principles to model a Theory of Mind (ToM)? Deep
learning approaches to address these questions fall short of a better
understanding of the problem. In part, this is due to the black-box nature of
deep networks, wherein computational mechanisms of ToM are not readily
revealed. Here, we consider alternative hypotheses seeking to model how the
brain might realize a ToM. In particular, we propose embodied and situated
agent models based on distributed adaptive control theory to predict actions of
other agents in five different game theoretic tasks (Harmony Game, Hawk-Dove,
Stag-Hunt, Prisoner's Dilemma and Battle of the Exes). Our multi-layer control
models implement top-down predictions from adaptive to reactive layers of
control and bottom-up error feedback from reactive to adaptive layers. We test
cooperative and competitive strategies among seven different agent models
(cooperative, greedy, tit-for-tat, reinforcement-based, rational, predictive
and other's-model agents). We show that, compared to pure reinforcement-based
strategies, probabilistic learning agents modeled on rational, predictive and
other's-model phenotypes perform better in game-theoretic metrics across tasks.
Our autonomous multi-agent models capture systems-level processes underlying a
ToM and highlight architectural principles of ToM from a control-theoretic

Therefore, to address these issues, a novel hybrid model is proposed in this

high- frequency. Next, a new multi-objective algorithm called MOHHO is first

quantifies the probability that the same ranking result will be generated by

concealing of speaker identities before the sharing of speech data. For this

extract linguistic and speaker identity features from an utterance and then to
use these with neural acoustic and waveform models to synthesize anonymized

work started addressing another challenge, namely, the maximization of

accomplished sensing tasks. In this research, we propose a new objective
function for matching tasks with participants, in order to achieve
CR-maximized, reputation-aware auctions. Particularly, we penalize redundant
task assignment, where a task is assigned to multiple participants, which can
consume the budget unnecessarily. We observe that the less the bidders on a
certain task, the higher the priority it should be assigned, to get
accomplished. Hence, we introduce a new factor, the task redundancy factor in
managing auctions. Through extensive simulations under varying conditions of
sensing campaigns, and given a fixed budget, we show that penalizing redundancy
(giving higher priority to unpopular tasks) yields significant CR increases of
approximately 50%, compared to the highest clearance rates in the recent

access to both state and action information generated by an expert performing
the task (e.g., the expert may provide a kinesthetic demonstration of object
placement using a robotic arm). However, requiring the action information
prevents imitation learning from a large number of existing valuable learning

issue, the specific problem of imitation from observation (IfO) has recently
garnered a great deal of attention, in which the imitator only has access to
the state information (e.g., video frames) generated by the expert. In this

latter has not been much investigated. This paper presents, to the best of our
knowledge, the first deep learning models for rearranging music of arbitrary
genres. Specifically, we build encoders and decoders that take a piece of
polyphonic musical audio as input and predict as output its musical score. We
investigate disentanglement techniques such as adversarial training to separate
latent factors that are related to the musical content (pitch) of different
parts of the piece, and that are related to the instrumentation (timbre) of the
parts per short-time segment. By disentangling pitch and timbre, our models
have an idea of how each piece was composed and arranged. Moreover, the models
can realize ""composition style transfer"" by rearranging a musical piece without
much affecting its pitch content. We validate the effectiveness of the models
by experiments on instrument activity detection and composition style transfer.

detected by this instrument. Coupled with X-ray and optical observations, the
standard external-shock model in a homogeneous medium is favored by this

find parameters for predicting MD hearing outcomes. Material and Methods: We
applied machine learning techniques to analyse transient-evoked otoacoustic
emission (TEOAE) signals recorded from patients with MD. Thirty unilateral MD
patients were recruited prospectively after onset of acute cochleo-vestibular
symptoms. Serial TEOAE and pure-tone audiogram (PTA) data were recorded
longitudinally. Denoised TEOAE signals were projected onto the three most
prominent principal directions through a linear transformation. Binary
classification was performed using a support vector machine (SVM). TEOAE signal
parameters, including signal energy and group delay, were compared between
improved and nonimproved groups using Welchs t-test. Results: Signal energy did
not differ (p = 0.64) but a significant difference in 1-kHz (p = 0.045) group
delay was recorded between improved and nonimproved groups. The SVM achieved a
cross-validated accuracy of >80% in predicting hearing outcomes. Conclusions
and Significance: This study revealed that baseline TEOAE parameters obtained

may provide information on outer hair cell function to predict hearing

charged particles through resistors. But Kirchhoff's law is widely used to
describe movements of current through resistors in high speed devices. Current
at high frequencies/short times involves much more than the translation of
particles. Transients abound. Augmentation of the resistors with ad hoc 'stray'
capacitances is often used to introduce transients into models like those in
real resistors. But augmentation hides the underlying problem, rather than
solves it: the location, value and dielectric properties of the stray
capacitances are not well determined. Here, we suggest a more general approach,
that is well determined. If current is redefined as in Maxwell's equations,
independent of the properties of dielectrics, Kirchhoff's law is exact and
transients arise automatically without ambiguity. The transients in a
particular real circuit-a high density integrated circuit for example-can then
be described by measured constitutive equations together with Maxwell's
equations without the introduction of arbitrary circuit elements.

$\mathcal{N}_\sigma\triangleq\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2 \mathrm{I}_d)$, by
$\hat{P}_n\ast\mathcal{N}_\sigma$, where $\hat{P}_n$ is the empirical measure,
under different statistical distances. The convergence is examined in terms of
the Wasserstein distance, total variation (TV), Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence, and $\chi^2$-divergence. We show that the approximation error under
the TV distance and 1-Wasserstein distance ($\mathsf{W}_1$) converges at rate
$e^{O(d)}n^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ in remarkable contrast to a typical
$n^{-\frac{1}{d}}$ rate for unsmoothed $\mathsf{W}_1$ (and $d\ge 3$). For the
KL divergence, squared 2-Wasserstein distance ($\mathsf{W}_2^2$), and
$\chi^2$-divergence, the convergence rate is $e^{O(d)}n^{-1}$, but only if $P$
achieves finite input-output $\chi^2$ mutual information across the additive
white Gaussian noise channel. If the latter condition is not met, the rate
changes to $\omega(n^{-1})$ for the KL divergence and $\mathsf{W}_2^2$, while
the $\chi^2$-divergence becomes infinite - a curious dichotomy. As a main
application we consider estimating the differential entropy
$h(P\ast\mathcal{N}_\sigma)$ in the high-dimensional regime. The distribution
$P$ is unknown but $n$ i.i.d samples from it are available. We first show that
any good estimator of $h(P\ast\mathcal{N}_\sigma)$ must have sample complexity
that is exponential in $d$. Using the empirical approximation results we then
show that the absolute-error risk of the plug-in estimator converges at the
parametric rate $e^{O(d)}n^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, thus establishing the minimax
rate-optimality of the plug-in. Numerical results that demonstrate a
significant empirical superiority of the plug-in approach to general-purpose
differential entropy estimators are provided.

of DCs, respectively. Then, a 3D multi-DC trajectory design algorithm is
developed to solve the MINLP problem, in which the sub-problems are optimized
iteratively through the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Compared with
the static DC deployment, the proposed trajectory design can lower the average

trajectory planning and scheduling algorithm to solve the sub-problems
iteratively based on the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. A k-means-based
initial trajectory generation and a search-based start slot scheduling are
considered in the proposed algorithm to improve trajectory design performance

are conducted to investigate the impacts of DBS quantity, horizontal speed and
initial trajectory on the trajectory planning results. Compared with the static
DBS deployment, the proposed trajectory planning can achieve 10-15 dB reduction
on average D2U pathloss, and reduce the D2U pathloss standard deviation by 68%,
which indicate the improvements of network performance and user fairness.

Although many methods have been proposed for community detection, most of them
only take into consideration the lower-order structure of the network at the
level of individual nodes and edges. Thus, they fail to capture the
higher-order characteristics at the level of small dense subgraph patterns,
e.g., motifs. Recently, some higher-order methods have been developed but they
typically focus on the motif-based hypergraph which is assumed to be a
connected graph. However, such assumption cannot be ensured in some real-world
networks. In particular, the hypergraph may become fragmented. That is, it may
consist of a large number of connected components and isolated nodes, despite
the fact that the original network is a connected graph. Therefore, the
existing higher-order methods would suffer seriously from the above
fragmentation issue, since in these approaches, nodes without connection in
hypergraph can't be grouped together even if they belong to the same community.
To address the above fragmentation issue, we propose an Edge enhancement
approach for Motif-aware community detection (EdMot). The main idea is as
follows. Firstly, a motif-based hypergraph is constructed and the top K largest
connected components in the hypergraph are partitioned into modules.
Afterwards, the connectivity structure within each module is strengthened by
constructing an edge set to derive a clique from each module. Based on the new
edge set, the original connectivity structure of the input network is enhanced
to generate a rewired network, whereby the motif-based higher-order structure
is leveraged and the hypergraph fragmentation issue is well addressed. Finally,
the rewired network is partitioned to obtain the higher-order community
structure.
