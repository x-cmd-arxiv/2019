susceptibility and heat capacity reveal two successive magnetic transitions at
$T_{N1} =$ 19 K and $T_{N2} =$ 11.8 K indicating two distinct magnetically
ordered phases. The single crystal neutron diffraction study shows that in the
temperature ($T$) range 11.8 K $\le T \le$ 19 K the magnetic structure is
commensurate with propagation vector $k_1 = (0, 0.5, 0)$, while upon lowering
temperature below $T_{N2} =$ 11.8 K an incommensurate magnetic order emerges
with $k_2 = (0.38, 0.48, 0.5)$ and the magnetic structure can be represented by
cycloidal modulation of the Mn spin in $ac-$plane. We are reporting this
commensurate to incommensurate transition for the first time. We discuss the
role of the magnetic exchange interactions and spin-orbital coupling on the

filler loading threshold. The thermal conductivity of composites with a
moderate graphene concentration of ~15 wt% exhibits an abrupt increase as the
loading of copper nanoparticles approaches ~40 wt%, followed by saturation. The
effect is attributed to intercalation of spherical copper nanoparticles between
the large graphene flakes, resulting in formation of the highly thermally

concentration, ~40 wt%, the thermal conductivity increases linearly with
addition of copper nanoparticles. The electrical percolation is observed at low
graphene loading, less than 7 wt.%, owing to the large aspect ratio of
graphene. At all concentrations of the fillers, below and above the electrical
percolation threshold, the thermal transport is dominated by phonons. The
obtained results shed light on the interaction between graphene fillers and

efficiently as a binary decision on whether to realize the natural textual

simple and quick training data preparation converting characters as contextual
vectors for learning the word boundary decision. Machine learning experiments
with four different classifiers show that training with 1,000 vectors and 1

applied to SigHAN Bakeoff 3 competition data, the WBD model produces OOV recall
rates that are higher than all published results. Unlike all previous work, our
OOV recall rate is comparable to our own F-score. Both experiments support the
claim that the WBD model is a realistic model for Chinese word segmentation as
it can be easily adapted for new variants with the robust result. In

replicas apply the same commands in the same order, even in the presence of
failures. Such strict ordering incurs high synchronization costs caused by
distributed consensus or by the use of a leader.
  This paper presents a protocol for linearizable state machine replication of
conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) that neither requires consensus nor
a leader. By leveraging the properties of state-based CRDTs - in particular,
the monotonic growth of a join semilattice - synchronization overhead is
greatly reduced. As a result, updates only need a single round trip and modify
the state 'in-place' without the need for a log. Furthermore, the message size
overhead for coordination consists of a single counter per message. For
queries, we guarantee finite writes termination. We show in an experimental
evaluation that more than 99 % of queries can be handled in one to three round
trips under highly concurrent accesses.
  Our protocol achieves high throughput without auxiliary processes such as
command log management or leader election. Thus, it is well suited for
practical scenarios that need linearizable access to CRDT data on a
fine-granular scale.

  SIMO Communications","appeared in the IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a practical structured constellation for
non-coherent communication with a single transmit antenna over Rayleigh flat
and block fading channel without instantaneous channel state information. The
constellation symbols belong to the Grassmannian of lines and are defined up to
a complex scaling. The constellation is generated by partitioning the
Grassmannian of lines into a collection of bent hypercubes and defining a
mapping onto each of these bent hypercubes such that the resulting symbols are
approximately uniformly distributed on the Grassmannian. With a reasonable
choice of parameters, this so-called cube-split constellation has higher
packing efficiency, represented by the minimum distance, than the existing
structured constellations. Furthermore, exploiting the constellation structure,
we propose low-complexity greedy symbol decoder and log-likelihood ratio
computation, as well as an efficient way to associate it to a multilevel code
with multistage decoding. Numerical results show that the performance of the
cube-split constellation is close to that of a numerically optimized
constellation and better than other structured constellations. It also
outperforms a coherent pilot-based scheme in terms of error probability and
achievable data rate in the regime of short coherence time and large
constellation size.

spectrum generated from a halo model that captures the impact of baryonic

cause severe degradation to forecasts of the neutrino mass sum, $\Sigma$,
approximately doubling $\sigma_{\Sigma}$. We show that including galaxy

16% for the normal and inverted hierarchies respectively. The combined
forecasts, $\sigma_{\Sigma_{\rm{NH}}}=0.034\, \rm{eV}$ and
$\sigma_{\Sigma_{\rm{IH}}}=0.034\, \rm{eV}$, preclude a meaningful distinction
of the hierarchies but could be improved upon with future CMB priors on $n_s$
and information from neutrinoless double beta decay to achieve a 2$\sigma$
distinction. The effect of intrinsic alignments on forecasts is shown to be
minimal, with $\sigma_{\Sigma}$ even experiencing mild improvements due to
information from the intrinsic alignment signal. We find that while adiabatic
contraction and intrinsic alignments will require careful calibration to
prevent significant biasing of $\Sigma$, there is less risk presented by

detections by Fermi-GBM, BBH-to-GRB ratio. A large majority of the models

  Translation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image-to-image translation, which translates input images to a different
domain with a learned one-to-one mapping, has achieved impressive success in
recent years. The success of translation mainly relies on the network
architecture to reserve the structural information while modify the appearance
slightly at the pixel level through adversarial training. Although these
networks are able to learn the mapping, the translated images are predictable
without exclusion. It is more desirable to diversify them using image-to-image
translation by introducing uncertainties, i.e., the generated images hold
potential for variations in colors and textures in addition to the general
similarity to the input images, and this happens in both the target and source
domains. To this end, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN)
based model, InjectionGAN, to learn a many-to-many mapping. In this model, the
input image is combined with latent variables, which comprise of
domain-specific attribute and unspecific random variations. The domain-specific
attribute indicates the target domain of the translation, while the unspecific
random variations introduce uncertainty into the model. A unified framework is
proposed to regroup these two parts and obtain diverse generations in each
domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the diverse generations have
high quality for the challenging image-to-image translation tasks where no
pairing information of the training dataset exits. Both quantitative and
qualitative results prove the superior performance of InjectionGAN over the
state-of-the-art approaches.

sulfur isotopic ratios compared with theoretical estimates. These ratios depend
on reliable $^{33}$S($p, \gamma$)$^{34}$Cl and $^{34}$S($p, \gamma$)$^{35}$Cl
reaction rates. The latter rate has recently been computed based on
experimental input, and many new excited states in $^{35}$Cl were discovered
above the proton threshold. The experimental $^{34}$S($p, \gamma$)$^{35}$Cl
rate was found to be 2 - 5 times smaller than the theoretical one, and the
simulated $^{34}$S/$^{32}$S isotopic ratio for nova presolar grains was thus
predicted to be smaller than that of type II supernova grains by up to a factor
of 3.7. The present study was performed to confirm the existence of these new
resonances, and to improve the remaining uncertainties in the $^{34}$S($p,
\gamma$)$^{35}$Cl reaction rate. Energies and spin-parities of the $^{35}$Cl
excited levels were investigated with an Enge split-pole spectrograph using the
$^{32}$S($\alpha, p$)$^{35}$Cl reaction. Differential cross sections of the
outgoing protons were measured at $E_{\alpha}$ = 21 MeV. The existence of the
newly discovered states are largely confirmed, although a few states were not
observed in this study. The spins and parities of several $^{35}$Cl states were
assigned tentatively for the first time. The present $^{34}$S($p,

1$\sigma$ with the previous evaluation. However, our rate uncertainty is larger

uncertainty in the present rate is up to a factor of 3.5 at nova temperatures.
We recommend future work to focus on the unknown properties of four excited

aimed at minimising elastic energy by curving spontaneously in ways that break
the symmetry of the sheet and the forcing. Characterising such buckling
generally requires detailed analysis. Here, we follow a complementary approach,
applicable to axisymmetric systems. It aims to predict the qualitative nature
of any buckling using only the simple axisymmetric geometry of the initial
system. We view an axisymmetric deformation according to the displacement it
imposes on the radial lines making up the sheet. Thus, e.g., in-plane tensile
loads on a disk-shaped annulus move radial lines along their length. Any
compressional strain present in this deformed state then implies
symmetry-breaking buckling out of the original plane. Using only these radial
motions, we account for the buckling predicted by more detailed analysis: axial
wrinkling confined to the inner part of the annulus. A second type of imposed
deformation on radial lines is motion normal to the sheet. Considering the
strains induced by rotating these lines through some common angle $\alpha$, one
may similarly account for both the buckling of d-cones and that of curved
creases. Our framework thus unifies three previously unconnected buckled
shapes.

vulnerability to adversarial attacks, which can be easily misled by adversarial
perturbations. With more aggressive methods proposed, adversarial attacks can
be also applied to the physical world, causing practical issues to various CNN
powered applications. To secure CNNs, adversarial attack detection is
considered as the most critical approach. However, most existing works focus on
superficial patterns and merely search a particular method to differentiate the
adversarial inputs and natural inputs, ignoring the analysis of CNN inner
vulnerability. Therefore, they can only target to specific physical adversarial
attacks, lacking expected versatility to different attacks. To address this
issue, we propose DoPa -- a comprehensive CNN detection methodology for various
physical adversarial attacks. By interpreting the CNN's vulnerability, we find
that non-semantic adversarial perturbations can activate CNN with significantly
abnormal activations and even overwhelm other semantic input patterns'
activations. Therefore, we add a self-verification stage to analyze the
semantics of distinguished activation patterns, which improves the CNN
recognition process. We apply such a detection methodology into both image and
audio CNN recognition scenarios. Experiments show that DoPa can achieve an
average rate of 90% success for image attack detection and 92% success for
audio attack detection.

connection as inferred from state-of-the-art cosmological,
magnetohydrodynamical simulations. With the high mass resolution and large
volume achieved by combining the 100 Mpc (TNG100) and 300 Mpc (TNG300) volumes,
we establish the mean occupancy of central and satellite galaxies and their
dependence on the properties of the dark matter haloes hosting them. We derive
best-fitting HOD parameters from TNG100 and TNG300 for target galaxy number
densities of $\bar{n}_g = 0.032\,h^3$Mpc$^{-3}$ and $\bar{n}_g =
0.016\,h^3$Mpc$^{-3}$, respectively, corresponding to a minimum galaxy stellar
mass of $M_\star\sim1.9\times10^9\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and
$M_\star\sim3.5\times10^9\,{\rm M}_\odot$, respectively, in hosts more massive
than $10^{11}\,{\rm M}_\odot$. Consistent with previous work, we find that
haloes located in dense environments, with low concentrations, later formation
times, and high angular momenta are richest in their satellite population. At
low mass, highly-concentrated haloes and those located in overdense regions are
more likely to contain a central galaxy. The degree of environmental dependence
is sensitive to the definition adopted for the physical boundary of the host
halo. We examine the extent to which correlations between galaxy occupancy and
halo properties are independent and demonstrate that HODs predicted by halo
mass and present-day concentration capture the qualitative dependence on the
remaining halo properties. At fixed halo mass, concentration is a strong
predictor of the stellar mass of the central galaxy, which may play a defining
role in the fate of the satellite population. The radial distribution of
satellite galaxies, which exhibits a universal form across a wide range of host
halo mass, is described accurately by the best-fit NFW density profile of their
host haloes.

large, they can induce a systematic error on $H_0$ of a few-percent if the lens

spectroscopic redshifts of the brightest galaxies towards the lens, and use the
ESO-MUSE integral field spectrograph to measure the velocity-dispersion of the
lens ($\sigma_{\rm {los}}= 250^{+15}_{-21}$ km/s) and of several nearby
galaxies. In addition, we measure photometric redshifts and stellar masses of
all galaxies down to $i < 23$ mag, mainly based on Dark Energy Survey imaging
(DR1). Our new catalog, complemented with literature data, more than doubles
the number of known galaxy spectroscopic redshifts in the direct vicinity of
the lens, expanding to 116 (64) the number of spectroscopic redshifts for
galaxies separated by less than 3 arcmin (2 arcmin) from the lens. Using the
flexion-shift as a measure of the amplitude of the gravitational perturbation,
we identify 2 galaxy groups and 3 galaxies that require specific attention in
the lens models. The ESO MUSE data enable us to measure the
velocity-dispersions of three of these galaxies. These results are essential
for the cosmological inference analysis presented in Rusu et al. (2019).

uncertainties in modern cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and
evolution. These processes determine the properties of galaxies, but are poorly
understood on the $\lesssim$100 pc scale of individual giant molecular clouds
(GMCs) resolved in modern galaxy formation simulations. The key question is why
the timescale for depleting molecular gas through star formation in galaxies
($t_{\rm dep}\approx 2$ Gyr) exceeds the dynamical timescale of GMCs by two
orders of magnitude. Either most of a GMC's mass is converted into stars over
many dynamical times, or only a small fraction turns into stars before the GMC
is dispersed on a dynamical timescale. Here we report our observation that
molecular gas and star formation are spatially de-correlated on GMC scales in
the nearby flocculent spiral galaxy NGC300, contrary to their tight correlation
on galactic scales. We demonstrate that this de-correlation implies rapid
evolutionary cycling between GMCs, star formation, and feedback. We apply a
novel statistical method to quantify the evolutionary timeline and find that
star formation is regulated by efficient stellar feedback, driving GMC
dispersal on short timescales (~1.5 Myr) due to radiation and stellar winds,
prior to supernova explosions. This feedback limits GMC lifetimes to about one
dynamical timescale (~10 Myr), with integrated star formation efficiencies of
only 2-3%. Our findings reveal that galaxies consist of building blocks
undergoing vigorous, feedback-driven lifecycles, that vary with the galactic
environment and collectively define how galaxies form stars. Systematic
applications of this multi-scale analysis to large galaxy samples will provide
key input for a predictive, bottom-up theory of galaxy formation and evolution.

winds driven by radiation pressure. However, the role of magnetic fields, which
are invoked in almost all models for accretion onto a supermassive black hole
and outflows, is not thoroughly studied. Here we report the first detection of
polarized thermal emission by means of magnetically aligned dust grains in the
dusty torus of NGC 1068 using ALMA Cycle 4 polarimetric dust continuum
observations ($0.07""$, $4.2$ pc; 348.5 GHz, $860$ $\mu$m). The polarized torus
has an asymmetric variation across the equatorial axis with a peak polarization
of $3.7\pm0.5$\% and position angle of $109\pm2^{\circ}$ (B-vector) at $\sim8$
pc east from the core. We compute synthetic polarimetric observations of
magnetically aligned dust grains assuming a toroidal magnetic field and
homogeneous grain alignment. We conclude that the measured 860 $\mu$m continuum
polarization arises from magnetically aligned dust grains in an optically thin
region of the torus. The asymmetric polarization across the equatorial axis of
the torus arises from 1) an inhomogeneous optical depth, and 2) a variation of
the velocity dispersion, i.e. variation of the magnetic field turbulence at
sub-pc scales, from the eastern to the western region of the torus. These
observations and modeling constrain the torus properties beyond spectral energy
distribution results. This study strongly supports that magnetic fields up to a
few pc contribute to the accretion flow onto the active nuclei.

have the attractive quality of being invariant under certain assumptions and
are therefore used as quantitative labels of a star's orbit. We report a subtle
but important systematic error that is induced in the actions as a consequence
of local midplane variations expected for the Milky Way. This error is
difficult to model because it is non-Gaussian and bimodal, with neither mode
peaking on the null value. An offset in the vertical position of the Galactic
midplane of $\sim15\,\text{pc}$ for a thin disk-like orbit or $\sim
120\,\text{pc}$ for a thick disk-like orbit induces a $25\%$ systematic error
in the vertical action $J_z$. In FIRE simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies,
these variations are on the order of $\sim100\,\text{pc}$ at the solar circle.
From observations of the mean vertical velocity variation of

Milky Way midplane variations are $\sim60\text{--}170\,\text{pc}$, consistent
with three-dimensional dust maps. Action calculations and orbit integrations,
which assume the global and local midplanes are identical, are likely to
include this induced error, depending on the volume considered. Variation in
the local standard of rest or distance to the Galactic center causes similar
issues. The variation of the midplane must be taken into account when
performing dynamical analysis across the large regions of the disk accessible

reducing the fraction of stars that form observable planets. We conclude with

loading factors of the order of unity. Strong outflow activity is correlated
with peaks in the star formation history of the galaxy with evidence that most
of the ejected gas eventually rains down onto the disc in a galactic fountain

this feature is another manifestation of the multiple stellar population
phenomenon observed in globular clusters (GCs). This new scenario requires a
significant fraction of the outer bulge stars with chemical patterns uniquely
observed in GCs. Here we show from homogeneous high-quality spectroscopic data
that the red giant branch stars in the outer bulge (> 5.5 degrees from the
Galactic center) are clearly divided into two groups according to Na abundance
in the [Na/Fe] - [Fe/H] plane. The Na-rich stars are also enhanced in Al, while
the differences in O and Mg are not observed between the two Na groups. The
population ratio and the Na and Al differences between the two groups are also
comparable with those observed in metal-rich GCs. The only plausible
explanation for these chemical patterns and characteristics appears to be that
the outer bulge was mostly assembled from disrupted proto-GCs in the early
history of the Milky Way.

the $Spitzer$/IRAC [3.6]$-$[4.5]$\simeq$0.8 mag color) require sub-Solar
metallicities ($Z\simeq0.1-0.2 Z_{\odot}$) and a high ionization parameter,
log$\,$U $\gtrsim -1.5$. These results favor models that produce higher
ionization, such as the BPASS models for the photospheres of high-mass stars,
and that include both binary stellar populations and/or an IMF that extends to
300 M$_{\odot}$. The combined C$\,$III] equivalent width and [3.6]$-$[4.5]
color are more consistent with ionization from young stars than AGN, however we
cannot rule out ionization from a combination of an AGN and young stars. We
make predictions for $James~Webb~Space~Telescope$ spectroscopy using these
different models, which will ultimately test the nature of the ionizing
radiation in this source.

much smaller that what is found by ALMA follow-up of other single-dish surveys

new secure CO(1-0) detection, although some of its members show only tentative
detections and require further confirmation. From the gas, dust, and stellar
properties of the two new protocluster cores, we find very large molecular gas
fractions yet low stellar masses, pushing the sources above the main sequence,
while not enhancing their star formation efficiency. We suggest that the
sources might be newly formed galaxies migrating to the main sequence. The
properties of the three systems compared to each other and to field galaxies
may suggest a different evolutionary stage between systems.

superorbital modulation is significantly weaker between MJD 55,700 and MJD
56,300. The joint NuSTAR and XRT observations, which were performed near the
minimum and maximum of one cycle of the 20 day superorbital modulation, show
that the flux increases by more than a factor of two between superorbital
minimum and maximum. We find no significant changes in the 3-50 keV pulse
profiles between superorbital minimum and maximum, which suggests a similar
accretion regime. Modeling the pulse-phase averaged spectra we find a possible
Fe K$\alpha$ emission line at 6.4 keV at superorbital maximum. The feature is
not significant at superorbital minimum. While we do not observe any
significant differences between the pulse-phase averaged spectral continua
apart from the overall flux change, we find that the hardness ratio near the

previously found to have stellar populations characteristic of massive ETGs
(with radially constant old ages and high alpha-enhancements), it was claimed
to show peculiar super-solar metallicity peaks at large radius that deviated
from an otherwise strong negative metallicity gradient, which is hard to
reconcile within a `two-phase' formation scenario. Our outer pointing confirms
the near-uniform old ages and the presence of a steep metallicity gradient, but
with no evidence for anomalously high metallicity values at large
galactocentric radii. We find a rising outer velocity dispersion profile and
high values of the 4th-order kinematic moment -- an indicator of possible
anisotropy. This coincides with the reported transition from a bottom-heavy to
a Salpeter initial mass function, which may indicate that we are probing the
transition region from the `in-situ' to the accreted phase. With short
exposures, we have been able to derive robust stellar kinematics and stellar
populations in NGC 1407 to about 1 effective radius. This experiment shows that
future work with KCWI will enable 2D kinematics and stellar populations to be

in a natural way. This could be a starting point for constructing quantum

This large nebula has several OB associations with bright nebulae at its

$^{12}$CO (J=1--0 and 2--1), and in some particular regions pointings of the
$^{13}$CO J=1--0 and 2--1 lines were also performed. Using ASTE we mapped the
whole extension of the N11 nebula in the $^{12}$CO J=3--2 line, and three
sub-regions in the $^{13}$CO J=3--2 line. The regions mapped in the $^{13}$CO
J=3--2 were selected based on that they may be exposed to the radiation at
different ways: a region lying over the nebula related to the OB association
LH10 (N11B), another one that it is associated with the southern part of the
nebula related to the OB association LH13 (N11D), and finally a farther area at
the southwest without any embedded OB association (N11I). We found that the
morphology of the molecular clouds lying in each region shows some signatures
that could be explained by the expansion of the nebulae and the action of the
radiation. Fragmentation generated in a molecular shell due to the expansion of
the N11 nebula is suggested. The integrated line ratios $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO
show evidences of selective photodissociation of the $^{13}$CO, and probably
other mechanisms such as chemical fractionation. The CO contribution to the
continuum at 870 $\mu$m was directly derived. The distribution of the
integrated line ratios $^{12}$CO J=3--2/2--1 show hints of stellar feedback in
N11B and N11D. The ratio between the virial and LTE mass (M$_{\rm vir}$/M$_{\rm

that the clumps are not gravitationally bounded and may be supported by

galactic nuclei (AGN) continues to be a topic of considerable debate. The issue
can be broken down into two distinct questions: 1) Can galaxy mergers trigger
AGN? 2) Are galaxy mergers the dominant AGN triggering mechanism? A complete
picture of the AGN-merger connection requires that both of these questions are
addressed with the same dataset. In previous work, we have shown that galaxy
mergers selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) show an excess of
both optically-selected, and mid-IR colour-selected AGN, demonstrating that the
answer to the first of the above questions is affirmative. Here, we use the
same optical and mid-IR AGN selection to address the second question, by
quantifying the frequency of morphological disturbances in low surface
brightness r-band images from the Canada France Imaging Survey (CFIS). Only ~30
per cent of optical AGN host galaxies are morphologically disturbed, indicating
that recent interactions are not the dominant trigger. However, almost 60 per
cent of mid-IR AGN hosts show signs of visual disturbance, indicating that
interactions play a more significant role in nuclear feeding. Both mid-IR and
optically selected AGN have interacting fractions that are a factor of two
greater than a mass and redshift matched non-AGN control sample, an excess that
increases with both AGN luminosity and host galaxy stellar mass.

the supremal structure of the functionals is preserved during the process of

double-integral functionals is currently still open. Our proof relies

a climatology for the region. While there have been considerable advances in
developing algorithms for extracting the track and evolution of cyclones from
reanalysis datasets, the data record is relatively short. This justifies the
need for a statistical model to represent the more extreme characteristics of
these weather systems, specifically their intensity and the spatial variability

modelling the lifecycle of extratropical cyclones in terms of both their tracks

common remedy is to retrain a framework's classifier. However, this loses
useful information if the classifier has learnt the current concept well, and
this concept will recur again in the future. Some frameworks retain and reuse
classifiers, but it can be time-consuming to select an appropriate classifier
to reuse. These frameworks rarely match the accuracy of state-of-the-art
ensemble approaches. For many data stream tasks, speed is important: fast,
accurate frameworks are needed for time-dependent applications. We propose the
Enhanced Concept Profiling Framework (ECPF), which aims to recognise recurring
concepts and reuse a classifier trained previously, enabling accurate
classification immediately following a drift. The novelty of ECPF is in how it
uses similarity of classifications on new data, between a new classifier and
existing classifiers, to quickly identify the best classifier to reuse. It
always trains both a new classifier and a reused classifier, and retains the
more accurate classifier when concept drift occurs. Finally, it creates a copy
of reused classifiers, so a classifier well-suited for a recurring concept will
not be impacted by being trained on a different concept. In our experiments,
ECPF classifies significantly more accurately than a state-of-the-art
classifier reuse framework (Diversity Pool) and a state-of-the-art ensemble
technique (Adaptive Random Forest) on synthetic datasets with recurring
concepts. It classifies real-world datasets five times faster than Diversity
Pool, and six times faster than Adaptive Random Forest and is not significantly

requirements: a time-averaged beam current of 40~$\mu$A with the ability to
switch the beam on or off for several minutes. These requirements are in
conflict with the typical operation mode of the TRIUMF cyclotron which delivers
nearly continuous beam to multiple users. To enable the creation of the UCN

ramped down in the same short period of time. This achieves a 12~mrad

ligand-field enhancing carbene bonds. Ultrafast transient absorption
spectroscopy reveals two distinct excited state populations for both mer and
fac forms, ascribed to the populations of the T1 and the T2 states,
respectively, which decay to the ground state via parallel pathways. We find
3-4 ps and 15-20 ps excited state lifetimes, with respective amplitudes
depending on the isomer. The longer lifetime exceeds the one reported for iron
complexes with tridentate ligands analogues involving four iron-carbene bonds.
By combining experimental and computational results, a mechanism based on the
differential trapping of the triplet states in spin-crossover regions is
proposed for the first time to explain the impact of the fac/mer isomerism on
the overall excited-state lifetimes. Our results clearly highlight the impact
of bidentate Pyridyl-NHC ligands on the photophysics of iron complexes,

establish a general method which complements the `localization' theorem which
has recently been established by B. Klartag. Klartag's Theorem is based on
optimal transport techniques, leading to a disintegration of the manifold
measure into marginal measures supported on geodesics of the manifold. This
leads to a reduction of the problem of proving a n-dimensional inequality into
an optimization problem over a class of measures with 1-dimensional supports.
In this work we firstly develop a general approach which leads to a reduction

of `model measures'. This reduction is based on functional analytic techniques,
in particular a classification of extreme points of a specific subset of
measures, and showing that the solution to the optimization problem is attained
on this set of extreme points. Finally we solve the optimization problems
associated with the Poincar\'{e}, p-Poincar\'{e} and the log-Sobolev

sharp Poincar\'{e} inequalities for $N\in (-\infty,0]$. We find that for $N\in

spectrum sensing and accurate source localization and tracking. Spectrum
sensors equipped with directional antennas should constantly scan the space in
order to track emitting sources and discover new activities in the area of
interest. In this paper, we propose a new formulation that unifies
received-signal-strength (RSS) and direction of arrival (DoA) in a compressive
sensing (CS) framework. The underlying CS measurement matrix is a function of
beamforming vectors of sensors and is referred to as the propagation matrix.
Comparing to the omni-directional antenna case, our employed propagation matrix
provides more incoherent projections, an essential factor in the compressive
sensing theory. Based on the new formulation, we optimize the antenna beams,
enhance spectrum sensing efficiency, track active primary users accurately and
monitor spectrum activities in an area of interest. In many practical scenarios
there is no fusion center to integrate received data from spectrum sensors. We
propose the distributed version of our algorithm for such cases. Experimental
results show a significant improvement in source localization accuracy,
compared with the scenario when sensors are equipped with omni-directional
antennas. Applicability of the proposed framework for dynamic radio cartography
is shown. Moreover, comparing the estimated dynamic RF map over time with the
ground truth demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method for accurate
signal estimation and recovery.

techniques for biomedical data processing. When tackling these tasks, one needs
to bear in mind that biomedical data depends on a variety of characteristics,

which might be unrelated with the target of the analysis. In supervised tasks,
failing to match the ground truth targets with respect to such characteristics,

from data selection, to normalization techniques, up to the use of training
algorithm for learning with imbalanced data. However, all these solutions
require the confounders to be known a priori. To this aim, we introduce a novel
index that is able to measure the confounding effect of a data attribute in a
bias-agnostic way. This index can be used to quantitatively compare the
confounding effects of different variables and to inform correction methods

geometry in determining the nature of the percolation transition in planar
hyperbolic manifolds. In Ref. [1], S. Boettcher, V. Singh, R. M. Ziff have
shown that a special type of two-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds, the Farey

using the renormalization group we investigate the critical properties of link
percolation on a wider class of two-dimensional hyperbolic deterministic and
random manifolds constituting the skeletons of two-dimensional cell complexes.
These hyperbolic manifolds are built iteratively by subsequently gluing
$m$-polygons to single edges. We show that when the size $m$ of the polygons is
drawn from a distribution $q_m$ with asymptotic power-law scaling $q_m\simeq
Cm^{-\gamma}$ for $m\gg1$, different universality classes can be observed for
different values of the power-law exponent $\gamma$. Interestingly the
percolation transition is hybrid for $\gamma\in (3,4)$ and becomes continuous
for $\gamma \in (2,3]$

to verify wire tension in large, open-frame multiwire planes. Using
finite-element simulation we predict the signal when two wires are set in
motion by applying and holding a DC voltage between them (electrostatic
excitation). The resulting current signal is marginal. However, the program
relates voltage, oscillation amplitude and signal, and it is easy to get enough
amplitude (of order microns) by gently tapping the wire frame. We perform an
end-to-end experimental test. Four 1.5m wires, at various tensions around 5N,
are mounted in an aluminum channel. They are connected to a low-noise, balanced
current-to-voltage preamp designed for good common-mode rejection. The 150V
bias, from 9V batteries in series, is built into the preamp. Data are taken
with a Tektronix 1202B scope, stored on a USB flash drive, and transferred to a
laptop computer for analysis. Ten measurements, each with 2500 samples spanning
1s, are taken for each of the three wire pairs. The wires are excited by
tapping the frame with a small mallet. Because the wire tensions are different,
the waveforms exhibit beats. The data are analyzed by a program which
decomposes the waveform step by step to extract the base and beat frequencies
and thereby, two resonant frequencies per wire pair. Finally, those frequencies
are disambiguated to obtain the frequency for each wire, which is then
converted to a tension. The four tensions are then found mechanically by
measuring the g/mm required to deflect each wire at its midpoint. The two
values of tension agree well. We conclude that the method verifies tension to
approximately 2% (1 sigma) in a little over 1s for 1.5m wires, and would be
faster for shorter wires.

simulations in General Relativity (GR). This code adopts the
Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism of GR, with constant mean curvature and
minimum distortion gauge fixings, which provides a fully nonlinear and
background independent framework for relativistic cosmology. Employing a fully
constrained formulation, the Einstein equations are reduced to a set of ten
elliptical equations which are solved using multigrid relaxation with adaptive
mesh refinements (AMR), and three hyperbolic equations for the evolution of
tensor degrees of freedom. The current version of GRAMSES neglects the latter
by using the conformal flatness approximation, which allows it to compute the
two scalar and two vector degrees of freedom of the metric. In this paper we
describe the methodology, implementation, code tests and first results for
cosmological simulations in a $\Lambda$CDM universe, while the generation of
initial conditions and physical results will be discussed elsewhere. Inheriting
the efficient AMR and massive parallelisation infrastructure from the
publicly-available $N$-body and hydrodynamic simulation code RAMSES, GRAMSES is
ideal for studying the detailed behaviour of spacetime inside virialised cosmic
structures and hence accurately quantifying the impact of backreaction effects
on the cosmic expansion, as well as for investigating GR effects on
cosmological observables using cosmic-volume simulations.

before the quench is assumed to be a normal electron gas, and the dynamics is
studied in a regime where long-range order is absent, but nonequilibrium
superconducting fluctuations need to be accounted for. A quantum kinetic
equation using a two-particle irreducible formalism is derived. Conservation of
energy, particle-number, and momentum emerge naturally, with the conserved
currents depending on both the electron Green's functions and the Green's
functions for the superconducting fluctuations. The quantum kinetic equation is
employed to derive a kinetic equation for the current, and the transient
optical conductivity relevant to pump-probe spectroscopy is studied. The
general structure of the kinetic equation for the current is also justified by
a phenomenological approach that assumes model-F in the Halperin-Hohenberg
classification, corresponding to a non-conserved order-parameter coupled to a
conserved density. Linear response conductivity and the diffusion coefficients
in thermal equilibrium are also derived, and connections with Aslamazov-Larkin
fluctuation corrections are highlighted. Results are also presented for the
time-evolution of the local density of states. It is shown that Andreev
scattering processes result in an enhanced density of states at low

conservation, but are difficult to obtain across large geographic scales and
for cryptic species. We used a state-space model with age-at-harvest data in a
Bayesian framework to model American black bear (Ursus americanus) abundance
and demographic parameters in four management zones in Wisconsin from
2011-2017. We had limited demographic data available from the population, and
relied upon a) the model, b) age-at-harvest data, and c) informative prior
distributions from a literature review. The estimated posterior means and
distributions for abundance and demographic parameters from our models were
reasonable for each management zone, and indicated a decreasing trend in zones
A and B, and a generally stable trend in zones C and D. The age-at-harvest data
updated the posterior distribution and means for initial population size,
harvest season survival, and non-harvest season survival, with a notable
increase in precision for the survival values. A strength of the model for
managers is the formalized process for providing biologically supported
information as prior distributions to transparently accommodate expert opinion
with measures of confidence when estimating wildlife populations, which can
then be updated by the age-at-harvest data and model structure. The integration
of prior information and age-at-harvest state-space models in a Bayesian
framework efficiently leverage all available information for making
zone-specific abundance estimates for the management of harvested species. This
may create more informative data for decision-makers when setting harvest
quotas, and could lead to more effective monitoring, conservation, and
management of cryptic carnivore species.

to significantly reduce the computation and storage cost compared with full

is how to preserve the information of the original data during adaptation. In
this paper, we propose a joint information preservation method to deal with the
problem. The method preserves the information of the original data from two
aspects. On the one hand, although paired samples often exist between the two
domains of the HDA, current algorithms do not utilize such information
sufficiently. The proposed method preserves the paired information by
maximizing the correlation of the paired samples in the shared subspace. On the
other hand, the proposed method improves the strategy of preserving the
structural information of the original data, where the local and global
structural information are preserved simultaneously. Finally, the joint
information preservation is integrated by distribution matching. Experimental
results show the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art
HDA algorithms.

efficient adaptation of the trained policy to a different task by transfer of

coupled dynamical units, prevail in a variety of systems. However, the
interaction structures among oscillators are static in most of studies on
chimera state. In this work, we consider a population of agents. Each agent
carries a phase oscillator. We assume that agents perform Brownian motions on a
ring and interact with each other with a kernel function dependent on the
distance between them. When agents are motionless, the model allows for several
dynamical states including two different chimera states (the type-I and the
type-II chimeras). The movement of agents changes the relative positions among
them and produces perpetual noise to impact on the model dynamics. We find that
the response of the coupled phase oscillators to the movement of agents depends
on both the phase lag $\alpha$, determining the stabilities of chimera states,
and the agent mobility $D$. For low mobility, the synchronous state transits to
the type-I chimera state for $\alpha$ close to $\pi/2$ and attracts other
initial states otherwise. For intermediate mobility, the coupled oscillators
randomly jump among different dynamical states and the jump dynamics depends on
$\alpha$. We investigate the statistical properties in these different
dynamical regimes and present the scaling laws between the transient time and
the mobility for low mobility and relations between the mean lifetimes of
different dynamical states and the mobility for intermediate mobility.

provides a continuous electron beam, with the current determined by the
filament size and temperature. A 1 GHz rectangular RF cavity deflects the beam
across a knife-edge, creating a pulsed beam. Adding a higher harmonic mode to
this cavity results in a flattened magnetic field profile which increases the
duty cycle to 30%. Finally, a compression cavity induces a negative
longitudinal velocity-time chirp in a bunch, initiating ballistic compression.
Adding a higher harmonic mode to this cavity increases the linearity of this
chirp and thus decreases the final bunch length. Charged particle simulations
show that with a 0.15 mm radius LaB6 filament held at 1760 K, this method can
create 279 fs, 3.0 pC electron bunches with a radial rms core emittance of
0.089 mm mrad at a repetition rate of 1 GHz.

simply pass through one another while the warm gas within them clashes at

waves in the frequency range $\sim 0.05 - 0.2 f_{ce}$ simultaneously with
electron velocity distribution functions that are a combination of
counter-streaming core and halo populations. A linear stability analysis shows
that the plasma is stable when there are no whistler waves, and unstable in the
presence of whistler waves. In the latter case, the stability analysis shows
that the whistler wave growth time is from a few to ten seconds at frequencies

demonstrate that the temperature anisotropy of halo electrons crucially affects
the heat flux instability onset: a slight anisotropy
$T_{\parallel}/T_{\perp}>1$ may quench the instability, while a slight

rate. These results demonstrate that heat flux inhibition is strongly dependent

modalities for versatile safety-critical applications such as self-driving
vehicles. Since the annotations of point cloud data is an expensive and
time-consuming process, therefore recently the utilisation of simulated
environments and 3D LiDAR sensors for this task started to get some popularity.
With simulated sensors and environments, the process for obtaining an annotated
synthetic point cloud data became much easier. However, the generated synthetic
point cloud data are still missing the artefacts usually exist in point cloud
data from real 3D LiDAR sensors. As a result, the performance of the trained
models on this data for perception tasks when tested on real point cloud data
is degraded due to the domain shift between simulated and real environments.
Thus, in this work, we are proposing a domain adaptation framework for bridging
this gap between synthetic and real point cloud data. Our proposed framework is

origin and effects are not entirely understood. We present a statistical
analysis of magnetic field fluctuations in the whistler frequency range (above
16 Hz) based on about 801,500 magnetic field spectra measured over three years
aboard ARTEMIS spacecraft in the pristine solar wind. About 13,700 spectra (30
hours in total) with intense magnetic field fluctuations satisfy the
interpretation in terms of quasi-parallel whistler waves. We provide estimates
of the whistler wave occurrence probability, amplitudes, frequencies and
bandwidths. The occurrence probability of whistler waves is shown to strongly
depend on the electron temperature anisotropy. The whistler waves amplitudes
are in the range from about 0.01 to 0.1 nT and typically below 0.02 of the
background magnetic field. The frequencies of the whistler waves are shown to
be below an upper bound that is dependent on $\beta_{e}$. The correlations
established between the whistler wave properties and local macroscopic plasma
parameters suggest that the observed whistler waves can be generated in local
plasmas by the whistler heat flux instability. The whistler wave amplitudes are
typically small, which questions the hypothesis that quasi-parallel whistler
waves are capable to regulate the electron heat flux in the solar wind. We show
that the observed whistler waves have sufficiently wide bandwidths and small
amplitudes, so that effects of the whistler waves on electrons can be addressed
in the frame of the quasi-linear theory.

order to train the joint pipeline using hybrid losses. The availability of
those annotations is yet often limited to a few image sets, potentially
restricting the general applicability of these methods to denoising more unseen

image denoising model dubbed U-SAID, based on a novel unsupervised approach
with a pixel-wise uncertainty loss. U-SAID does not need any ground-truth
segmentation map, and thus can be applied to any image dataset. It generates
denoised images with comparable or even better quality, and the denoised
results show stronger robustness for subsequent semantic segmentation tasks,
when compared to either its supervised counterpart or classical
""application-agnostic"" denoisers. Moreover, we demonstrate the superior
generalizability of U-SAID in three-folds, by plugging its ""universal"" denoiser
without fine-tuning: (1) denoising unseen types of images; (2) denoising as
pre-processing for segmenting unseen noisy images; and (3) denoising for unseen
high-level tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness,

consider estimation of the inverse covariance matrix for multivariate data. We
provide a novel notion of a Wasserstein ambiguity set specifically tailored to
this estimation problem, leading to a tractable class of regularized
estimators. Special cases include penalized likelihood estimators for Gaussian
data, specifically the graphical lasso estimator. As a consequence of this
formulation, the radius of the Wasserstein ambiguity set is directly related to
the regularization parameter in the estimation problem. Using this
relationship, the level of robustness of the estimation procedure can be shown
to correspond to the level of confidence with which the ambiguity set contains
a distribution with the population covariance. Furthermore, a unique feature of
our formulation is that the radius can be expressed in closed-form as a
function of the ordinary sample covariance matrix. Taking advantage of this
finding, we develop a simple algorithm to determine a regularization parameter
for graphical lasso, using only the bootstrapped sample covariance matrices,
meaning that computationally expensive repeated evaluation of the graphical
lasso algorithm is not necessary. Alternatively, the distributionally robust
formulation can also quantify the robustness of the corresponding estimator if
one uses an off-the-shelf method such as cross-validation. Finally, we

here we present a multi-wavelength study toward six molecular clouds. All of
these clouds contain several massive clumps in different evolutionary stages of
star formation. Using archival data of Herschel InfraRed Galactic Plane Survey
(Hi-GAL), we made H2 column density and dust temperature maps of these regions
by the spectral energy distribution (SED) method. We found all of the six
clouds show distinct dust temperature gradients, ranging from 20 K to 30 K.
This makes them good candidates to study chemical evolution of molecules (such
as N2H+) in different evolutionary stages of star formation. Our molecular line
data come from Millimeter Astronomy Legacy Team Survey at 90 GHz (MALT90). We
made column density and then abundance maps of N2H+. We found that when the
dust temperature is above 27 K, the abundance of N2H+ begins to decrease or
reaches a plateau. We regard this is because that in the photodissociation
regions (PDRs) around classical HII regions, N2H+ is destroyed by free
electrons heavily. However, when the dust temperature is below 27 K, the
abundance of N2H+ increases with dust temperature. This seems to be
inconsistent with previous chemical models made in low-mass star-forming
regions. In order to check out whether this inconsistency is caused by a
different chemistry in high-mass star-forming clumps, higher angular resolution
observations are necessary.

problems in areas such as databases, machine learning, and information
retrieval. MinHash is a well-known technique for approximating Jaccard
similarity of sets and has been successfully used for many applications such as
similarity search and large scale learning. Its two compressed versions, b-bit
MinHash and Odd Sketch, can significantly reduce the memory usage of the
original MinHash method, especially for estimating high similarities (i.e.,
similarities around 1). Although MinHash can be applied to static sets as well
as streaming sets, of which elements are given in a streaming fashion and
cardinality is unknown or even infinite, unfortunately, b-bit MinHash and Odd
Sketch fail to deal with streaming data. To solve this problem, we design a
memory efficient sketch method, MaxLogHash, to accurately estimate Jaccard
similarities in streaming sets. Compared to MinHash, our method uses smaller
sized registers (each register consists of less than 7 bits) to build a compact
sketch for each set. We also provide a simple yet accurate estimator for
inferring Jaccard similarity from MaxLogHash sketches. In addition, we derive
formulas for bounding the estimation error and determine the smallest necessary
memory usage (i.e., the number of registers used for a MaxLogHash sketch) for
the desired accuracy. We conduct experiments on a variety of datasets, and
experimental results show that our method MaxLogHash is about 5 times more
memory efficient than MinHash with the same accuracy and computational cost for
estimating high similarities.

emission from the jet reflects a high SMBH spin, which stems from the
well-known BZ mechanism of jet production, high-mass SMBHs (i.e.,

classical bulges, and low-mass SMBHs (i.e., $M_{\mathrm{BH}}=10^{6-7}M_\odot$)

enabling high data rates in FD systems is the inter-user interference (IUI) due
to activating pairs of uplink and downlink users at the same time-frequency
resource block. Opportunistic user scheduling has been proposed as a means to
manage IUI and fully exploit the multiplexing gains in FD systems. In this
paper, scheduling under long-term and short-term temporal fairness for
single-cell FD wireless networks is considered. Temporal fair scheduling is of
interest in delay-sensitive applications, and leads to predictable latency and
power consumption. The feasible region of user temporal demand vectors is
derived, and a scheduling strategy maximizing the system utility while
satisfying long-term temporal fairness is proposed. Furthermore, a short-term
temporal fair scheduling strategy is devised which satisfies user temporal
demands over a finite window-length. It is shown that the strategy achieves
optimal average system utility as the window-length is increased
asymptotically. Subsequently, practical construction algorithms for long-term
and short-term temporal fair scheduling are introduced. Simulations are
provided to verify the derivations and investigate the multiplexing gains. It
is observed that using successive interference cancellation at downlink users
improves FD gains significantly in the presence of strong IUI.

discs, and central bulges. Relative dominance of these components is known to
correlate with the total mass of the galaxy, and produces a remarkable
morphological variety of spiral galaxies. Although there are many formation
scenarios regarding individual components, no unified theory exists which
explains this systematic variation. The cold-flow hypothesis predicts that
galaxies grow by accretion of cold gas from cosmic webs (cold accretion) when
their mass is below a certain threshold, whereas in the high-mass regime the
gas that entered the dark matter halo is first heated by shock waves to high
temperatures and then accretes to the forming galaxy as it cools emitting
radiation (cooling flow). This hypothesis also predicts that massive galaxies
at high redshifts have a hybrid accretion structure in which filaments of cold
inflowing gas penetrate surrounding hot gas. In the case of Milky Way, the
previous study suggested that the cold accretion created its thick disc in
early times and the cooling flow formed the thin disc in later epochs. Here we
report that extending this idea to galaxies with various masses and associating
the hybrid accretion with the formation of bulges reproduces the observed
mass-dependent structures of spiral galaxies: namely, more massive galaxies
have lower thick disc mass fractions and higher bulge mass fractions. The
proposed scenario predicts that thick discs are older in age and poorer in iron
than thin discs, the trend observed in the Milky Way (MW) and other spiral
galaxies.

Conlon, Janzer, and Lee recently conjectured that for any integers $s,t,k\geq
2$, $ex(n,K_{s,t}^k)=O(n^{1+\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{sk}})$. Among many other
things, they settled the $k=2$ case of their conjecture. As the main result of
this paper, we prove their conjecture for $k=3,4$. Our main results also yield
infinitely many new so-called Tur\'an exponents: rationals $r\in (1,2)$ for
which there exists a bipartite graph $H$ with $ex(n, H)=\Theta(n^r)$, adding to
the lists recently obtained by Jiang, Ma, Yepremyan, by Kang, Kim, Liu, and by
Conlon, Janzer, Lee. Our method builds on an extension of the Conlon-Janzer-Lee
method. We also note that the extended method also gives a weaker version of
the Conlon-Janzer-Lee conjecture for all $k\geq 2$.

partial differential equations of parabolic type in a class of stochastic
Hoelder spaces. The Hoelder estimates of solutions and their spatial
derivatives up to order $2m$ are obtained, based on which the existence and
uniqueness of solution is proved. An interesting finding of this paper is that
the regularity of solutions relies on a coercivity condition that differs when
$m$ is odd or even: the condition for odd $m$ coincides with the standard
parabolicity condition in the literature for higher-order stochastic partial

observe up to billions of galaxies. While such surveys cannot obtain spectra
for all observed galaxies, they produce galaxy magnitudes in color filters.
This data set behaves like a high-dimensional nonlinear surface, an excellent
target for machine learning. In this work, we use a lightcone of semianalytic
galaxies tuned to match CANDELS observations from Lu et al. (2014) to train a
set of neural networks on a set of galaxy physical properties. We add realistic
photometric noise and use trained neural networks to predict stellar masses and
average star formation rates on real CANDELS galaxies, comparing our
predictions to SED fitting results. On semianalytic galaxies, we are nearly
competitive with template-fitting methods, with biases of $0.01$ dex for
stellar mass, $0.09$ dex for star formation rate, and $0.04$ dex for
metallicity. For the observed CANDELS data, our results are consistent with
template fits on the same data at $0.15$ dex bias in $M_{\rm star}$ and $0.61$
dex bias in star formation rate. Some of the bias is driven by SED-fitting
limitations, rather than limitations on the training set, and some is intrinsic
to the neural network method. Further errors are likely caused by differences
in noise properties between the semianalytic catalogs and data. Our results
show that galaxy physical properties can in principle be measured with neural
networks at a competitive degree of accuracy and precision to template-fitting
methods.

we propose a novel deep network architecture, which guided by meaningful
attributes including camera views, vehicle types and colors for vehicle Re-ID.
In particular, our network is end-to-end trained and contains three subnetworks
of deep features embedded by the corresponding attributes (i.e., camera view,
vehicle type and vehicle color). Moreover, to overcome the shortcomings of
limited vehicle images of different views, we design a view-specified
generative adversarial network to generate the multi-view vehicle images. For
network training, we annotate the view labels on the VeRi-776 dataset. Note
that one can directly adopt the pre-trained view (as well as type and color)
subnetwork on the other datasets with only ID information, which demonstrates
the generalization of our model. Extensive experiments on the benchmark
datasets VeRi-776 and VehicleID suggest that the proposed approach achieves the
promising performance and yields to a new state-of-the-art for vehicle Re-ID.

using a denoising autoencoder with U-Net architecture. The proposed network
takes into consideration the accuracy and the computation cost to enable
real-time implementation on underwater visual tasks using end-to-end
autoencoder network. Underwater vehicles perception is improved by
reconstructing captured frames; hence obtaining better performance in
underwater tasks. Related learning methods use generative adversarial networks

little about the interrelationships between the coronal magnetic field
configurations and the resulting quasi-stationary structures observed in
coronagraphic images (as streamers, plumes, coronal holes). One way to obtain
information on the large-scale structure of the coronal magnetic field is to
extrapolate it from photospheric data and compare the results with
coronagraphic images. Our aim is to verify if this comparison can be a fast
method to check systematically the reliability of the many methods available to
reconstruct the coronal magnetic field. Coronal fields are usually extrapolated
from photospheric measurements typically in a region close to the central
meridian on the solar disk and then compared with coronagraphic images at the
limbs, acquired at least 7 days before or after to account for solar rotation,
implicitly assuming that no significant changes occurred in the corona during
that period. In this work, we combine images from three coronagraphs
(SOHO/LASCO-C2 and the two STEREO/SECCHI-COR1) observing the Sun from different
viewing angles to build Carrington maps covering the entire corona to reduce
the effect of temporal evolution to ~ 5 days. We then compare the position of
the observed streamers in these Carrington maps with that of the neutral lines
obtained from four different magnetic field extrapolations, to evaluate the
performances of the latter in the solar corona. Our results show that the

i.e. maximally non-integrable $2$-plane fields on $4$-manifolds. Two $1$-forms
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are called Engel defining forms if
$\mathcal{D}=\ker\alpha\cap\ker\beta$ is an Engel structure and
$\mathcal{E}=\ker\alpha$ is its associated even contact structure, i.e.
$\mathcal{E}=[\mathcal{D},\mathcal{D}]$. A choice of Engel defining forms
determines a distribution $\mathcal{R}$ transverse to $\mathcal{D}$ called the
Reeb distribution. We study conditions that ensure integrability of
$\mathcal{R}$. For example if we have a metric $g$ which makes the splitting
$TM=\mathcal{D}\oplus\mathcal{R}$ orthogonal and such that $\mathcal{D}$ is
totally geodesic then there exists an integrable Reeb distribution
$\tilde{\mathcal{R}}$.
  It turns out that integrabilty of $\mathcal{R}$ is related to the existence
of vector fields $Z$ whose flow preserves $\mathcal{D}$, so called Engel vector
fields. A K-Engel structure is a triple $(\mathcal{D},\,g,\,Z)$ where
$\mathcal{D}$ is an Engel structure, $g$ is a Riemannian metric, and $Z$ is a
vector field which is Engel, Killing, and orthogonal to $\mathcal{E}$. In this
case we can construct Engel defining forms with very nice properties and such
that $\mathcal{R}$ is integrable. Moreover we can classify the topology of
K-Engel manifolds studying the action of the flow of $Z$. As natural
consequences of these methods we provide a construction which is the analogue
of the Boothby-Wang construction in the contact setting and we give a notion of
contact filling for an Engel structure.

antiferromagnetic bimeron driven by a spin current. Numerical simulations
demonstrate that the spin current can create an isolated bimeron in the
antiferromagnetic thin film via the damping-like spin torque. The spin current
can also effectively drive the antiferromagnetic bimeron without a transverse
drift. The steady motion of an antiferromagnetic bimeron is analytically
derived and is in good agreement with the simulation results. Also, we find
that the alternating-current-induced motion of the antiferromagnetic bimeron
can be described by the Duffing equation due to the presence of the nonlinear
boundary-induced force. The associated chaotic behavior of the bimeron is
analyzed in terms of the Lyapunov exponents. Our results demonstrate the
inertial dynamics of an antiferromagnetic bimeron, and may provide useful
guidelines for building future bimeron-based spintronic devices.

isostructural to the extensively studied Kondo insulator CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ which

In this structure, the Pr atom fills the void formed by the octahedral
Ru$_4$Sn$_6$ units which results in a tetragonal body-centred arrangement. Here
we present reports on the physical and magnetic properties of PrRu$_4$Sn$_6$.
The temperature dependences of specific heat, $C_p(T)$, electrical resistivity,
$\rho(T)$, and magnetic susceptibility, $\chi(T)$, reveal the absence of a
long-range magnetic ordering down to 2 K. $\chi(T)$ follows a Curie-Weiss
behaviour above 100 K with an effective magnetic moment, $\mu_\mathrm{eff}$ =
3.34 $\mu_B$/Pr and paramagnetic Weiss temperature, $\theta_p$ = $-$19.47 K
indicating a dominant antiferromagnetic interaction. The magnetization at 2 K
is quasi-linear in nature and attains a value of 0.86 $\mu_B$/Pr at 7 T which
is well reduced compared to the calculated value of 3.32 $\mu_B$/Pr expected
for a free Pr$^{3+}$ ion. This is attributed to possible magneto-crystalline
anisotropy in the system. $C_p(T)$ indicates the presence of a optical-phonon
mode which is supported by a glass-like thermal conductivity above $\sim$45 K.
This observation is associated with caged structured compounds where the
low-frequency optical-phonon mode of the guest atom interacts with the host
lattice, resulting in the scattering of heat-carrying quasiparticles.

PEPSI: parallel extended-decoder path for semantic inpainting network, which

PEPSI consists of a single shared encoding network and parallel decoding
networks called coarse and inpainting paths. The coarse path produces a
preliminary inpainting result to train the encoding network for the prediction
of features for the CAM. Simultaneously, the inpainting path generates higher
inpainting quality using the refined features reconstructed via the CAM. In

global contextual information with low hardware costs, we propose novel
rate-adaptive dilated convolutional layers, which employ the common weights but
produce dynamic features depending on the given dilation rates. Extensive
experiments comparing the performance with state-of-the-art image inpainting

show an $\Omega(\log n)$ round lower bound for CONNECTIVITY even for
constant-error randomized Monte Carlo algorithms. The deterministic version of
this result can be obtained via the well-known ""edge-crossing"" argument, but,
the randomized version of this result requires establishing new combinatorial
results regarding the indistinguishability graph induced by inputs. In our
second result, we show that the $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound result extends to
the KT-$1$ version of the BCC$(1)$ model, in which nodes are aware of IDs of
all neighbors, though our proof works only for deterministic algorithms. Since
nodes know IDs of their neighbors in the KT-$1$ model, it is no longer possible
to play ""edge-crossing"" tricks; instead we present a reduction from the 2-party
communication complexity problem PARTITION in which Alice and Bob are give two
set partitions on $[n]$ and are required to determine if the join of these two
set partitions equals the trivial one-part set partition. While our KT-$1$
CONNECTIVITY lower bound holds only for deterministic algorithms, in our third
result we extend this $\Omega(\log n)$ KT-1 lower bound to constant-error Monte
Carlo algorithms for the closely related CONNECTED COMPONENTS problem. We use
information-theoretic techniques to obtain this result. All our results hold
for the seemingly easy special case of CONNECTIVITY in which an algorithm has
to distinguish an instance with one cycle from an instance with multiple
cycles. Our results showcase three rather different lower bound techniques and
lay the groundwork for further improvements in lower bounds for CONNECTIVITY in

unsolved problem. While the scenario-based test approach seems to provide a
possible solution, it requires the execution of a high amount of test cases.
Several test benches, from actual test vehicles to partly or fully simulated
environments, are available, but choosing the optimal test bench, e.g. in terms
of required execution time and costs, is a difficult task. Every test bench
provides different elements, e.g. simulation models which can be used for test
case execution. The composition of elements at a specific test bench is called
test bench configuration. This test bench configuration determines the actual
performance of a test bench and, therefore, whether the run of a particular
test case provides valid test case results with respect to the intended
purpose, e.g. a safety validation. For an effective and efficient test case
execution, a method is required to assign test cases to the most appropriate
test bench configuration. Therefore, it is indispensable to have a method to
classify test bench configurations in a clear and reproducible manner. In this
paper, we propose a method for classifying test benches and test bench
configurations and illustrate the classification method with some examples. The
classification method serves as a basis for a systematic assignment of test
cases to test bench configurations which allows for an effective and efficient

likely that at this time it was used by many scientists, including Einstein.
However, my research also shows that the move from the KOL was done purely for
financial reasons and had nothing to do with Einstein. It is possible that the

training data with bounded perturbation, hoping to manipulate the behavior
(both targeted or non-targeted) of any corresponding trained classifier during
test time when facing clean samples. To achieve this, we proposed to use an
auto-encoder-like network to generate the pertubation on the training data
paired with one differentiable system acting as the imaginary victim
classifier. The perturbation generator will learn to update its weights by
watching the training procedure of the imaginary classifier in order to produce
the most harmful and imperceivable noise which in turn will lead the lowest
generalization power for the victim classifier. This can be formulated into a
non-linear equality constrained optimization problem. Unlike GANs, solving such
problem is computationally challenging, we then proposed a simple yet effective
procedure to decouple the alternating updates for the two networks for
stability. The method proposed in this paper can be easily extended to the
label specific setting where the attacker can manipulate the predictions of the
victim classifiers according to some predefined rules rather than only making
wrong predictions. Experiments on various datasets including CIFAR-10 and a
reduced version of ImageNet confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method
and empirical results showed that, such bounded perturbation have good
transferability regardless of which classifier the victim is actually using on

systematically investigated as functions of the neutron fluence, gamma ray

the gamma ray dose after the samples are radiated by neutrons. Two negative
synergistic effects are derived, both of which have similar magnitudes as the
ionization damage (ID) itself. The first one depends linearly on the gamma ray
dose, whose slope depends quadratically on the initial displacement damage (DD)
and can be attributed to the healing of neutron-radiation-induced defects in
silicon. The second one has an exponential decay with the gamma ray dose, whose
amplitude shows a rather strong enhanced low-dose-rate sensitivity (ELDRS)
effect and can be attributed to the passivation of neutron-induced defects near
the silica/silicon interface by the gamma-ray-generated protons in silica,
which can penetrate the silica/silicon interface to passivate the
neutron-induced defects in silicon. The simulated results based on the proposed
model match the experimental data very well, but differ from previous model,
which does not assume annihilation or passivation of the displacement defects.
The unraveled defect annealing mechanism is important because it implies that
displacement damages can be repaired by gamma ray radiation or proton
diffusion, which can have important device applications in the space or other
extreme environments.

complex industrial systems, we focus on one variance reduction method in a
given context, that is the interacting particle system method (IPS) used on
piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMP) for reliability assessment .
The PDMPs are a very large class of processes which benefit from high modeling
capacities, they can model almost any Markovian phenomenon that does not
include diffusion. In reliability assessment, the PDMPs modeling industrial
systems generally involve low jump rates and jump kernels favoring one safe
arrival, we call such model a ""concentrated PDMP"".
  Used on such concentrated PDMPs, the IPS is inefficient and does not always
provide a variance reduction. Indeed, the efficiency of the IPS method relies
on simulating many different trajectories during its propagation steps, but
unfortunately concentrated PDMPs are likely to generate the same deterministic
trajectories over and over. We propose an adaptation of the IPS method called
IPS+M that reduces this phenomenon. The IPS+M consists in modifying the
propagation steps of the IPS, by conditioning the propagation to avoid
generating the same trajectories multiple times. We prove that, compared to the
IPS, the IPS+M method always provides an estimator with a lower variance. We
also carry out a quick simulation study on a two-components system that

alternating minimization schemes are mostly used. They usually suffer from the
major drawback that the solution is biased towards one of the optimization

Lipschitz continuity of the gradient in matrix factorization problems,
convergence cannot be guaranteed. A recently developed approach relies on the
concept of Bregman distances, which generalizes the standard Euclidean
distance. We exploit this theory by proposing a novel Bregman distance for
matrix factorization problems, which, at the same time, allows for
simple/closed form update steps. Therefore, for non-alternating schemes, such
as the recently introduced Bregman Proximal Gradient (BPG) method and an
inertial variant Convex--Concave Inertial BPG (CoCaIn BPG), convergence of the
whole sequence to a stationary point is proved for Matrix Factorization. In
several experiments, we observe a superior performance of our non-alternating

on deep neural networks (DNNs) are theoretically derived. These bounds are
functions of several norms of weights of the DNNs, such as the Frobenius and
spectral norms, and they are computed for weights grouped according to either
input and output channels of the DNNs. In this work, we conjecture that if we
can impose multiple constraints on weights of DNNs to upper bound the norms of
the weights, and train the DNNs with these weights, then we can attain
empirical generalization errors closer to the derived theoretical bounds, and
improve accuracy of the DNNs.
  To this end, we pose two problems. First, we aim to obtain weights whose
different norms are all upper bounded by a constant number, e.g. 1.0. To
achieve these bounds, we propose a two-stage renormalization procedure; (i)
normalization of weights according to different norms used in the bounds, and
(ii) reparameterization of the normalized weights to set a constant and finite
upper bound of their norms. In the second problem, we consider training DNNs
with these renormalized weights. To this end, we first propose a strategy to
construct joint spaces (manifolds) of weights according to different
constraints in DNNs. Next, we propose a fine-grained SGD algorithm (FG-SGD) for
optimization on the weight manifolds to train DNNs with assurance of
convergence to minima. Experimental results show that image classification
accuracy of baseline DNNs can be boosted using FG-SGD on collections of
manifolds identified by multiple constraints.

Firstly, we generalize a result of Garnett, Mourgoglou and Tolsa by showing
that domains in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ whose boundaries are lower $d$-content
regular admit Corona decompositions for harmonic measure if and only if the
square sum $\beta_{\partial\Omega}$ of the generalized Jones $\beta$-numbers is
finite. Secondly, for semi-uniform domains with Ahlfors regular boundaries, it
is known that uniform rectifiability implies harmonic measure is $A_{\infty}$
for semi-uniform domains, but now we give more explicit dependencies on the
$A_{\infty}$-constant in terms of the uniform rectifiability constant. This
follows from a more general estimate that does not assume the boundary to be
uniformly rectifiable. For general semi-uniform domains, we also show how to
bound the harmonic measure of a subset in terms of that sets Hausdorff measure
and the square sum of $\beta$-numbers on that set.
  Using this, we give estimates on the fluctuation of Green's function in a
uniform domain in terms of the $\beta$-numbers. As a corollary, for bounded NTA
domains , if $B_{\Omega}=B(x_{\Omega},c\mathrm{diam} \Omega)$ is so that
$2B_{\Omega}\subseteq \Omega$, we obtain that \[ (\mathrm{diam}

by technology at that time are also no longer relevant. In this memo, we look
into the scientific advantages of beginning with Band 2 when implementing such
wideband technologies. The Band 2 receiver system will be the last of the
original ALMA bands, completing ALMA's coverage of the atmospheric windows from
35-950 GHz, and is not yet covered by any other ALMA receiver. New receiver
designs covering and significantly extending the original ALMA Band 2 frequency
range (67-90 GHz) can now implement these technologies. We explore the
scientific and operational advantages of a receiver covering the full 67-116
GHz atmospheric window. In addition to technological goals, the ALMA
Development Roadmap provides 3 new key science drivers for ALMA, to probe: 1)
the Origins of Galaxies, 2) the Origins of Chemical Complexity, and 3) the
Origins of Planets. In this memo, we describe how the wide RF Band 2 system can
help achieve these goals, enabling several high-profile science programmes to
be executed uniquely or more effectively than with separate systems, requiring
an overall much lower array time and achieving more consistent calibration
accuracy: contiguous broad-band spectral surveys, measurements of deuterated
line ratios, and more generally fractionation studies, improved continuum
measurements (also necessary for reliable line flux measurements), simultaneous
broad-band observations of transient phenomena, and improved bandwidth for 3 mm
very long baseline interferometry (VLBI).

to agents to efficiently fulfill their missions. Relying on wrong information,
however, can have severe consequences. While classical approaches only consider
measurement uncertainty, reliability information on the incoming data can be
useful for decision making. In this work, a subjective logic based mechanism is
proposed that amends reliability information to the data shared among the MAS.
  If multiple agents report the same event, their information is fused. In
order to maintain high reliability, the mechanism detects and isolates
misbehaving agents. Therefore, an attacker model is specified that includes
faulty as well as malicious agents. The mechanism is applied to Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS) and it is shown in simulation that the approach
scales well with the size of the MAS and that it is able to efficiently

precisely, we consider 126 time intervals of Ulysses magnetic field

multifractality as the measure of intermittency in the MHD range of scales, for
a wide range of heliocentric distances and heliolatitudes. The results show a
slow decrease of intermittency with the radial distance, which is more
significant for the fast than for the slow solar wind. Analysis of Alfvenic and
compressive fuctuations confirms the decrease of intermittency with distance
and latitude. This radial dependence of multifractality/intermittency may be
explained by a slower evolution of turbulence beyond the ecliptic plane and by
the reduced efficiency of intermittency drivers with the distance from the Sun.
Additionally, our analysis shows that the greatest differences between magnetic
field components are revealed close to the Sun, where intermittency is the
strongest. Moreover, we observe that the slow solar wind from the maximum of
the solar cycle 23 exhibits in general, a lower level of multifractality
(intermittency) than fast solar wind, which can be related to the idea of a new
type of Alfvenic slow solar wind.

  Tractability",,,,,"cs.DM cs.DS cs.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is a framework for modeling and solving
a variety of real-world problems. Once the problem is expressed as a finite set
of constraints, the goal is to find the variables' values satisfying them. Even
though the problem is in general NP-complete, there are some approximation and
practical techniques to tackle its intractability. One of the most widely used
techniques is the Constraint Propagation. It consists in explicitly excluding
values or combination of values for some variables whenever they make a given
subset of constraints unsatisfied. In this paper, we deal with a CSP subclass
which we call 4-CSP and whose constraint network infers relations of the form:
$\{ x \sim \alpha, x-y \sim \beta , (x-y) - (z-t) \sim \lambda \}$, where $x,
y, z$ and $t$ are real variables, $\alpha , \beta$ and $ \lambda $ are real
constants and $ \sim \in \{\leq , \geq \} $. The paper provides the first
graph-based proofs of the 4-CSP tractability and elaborates algorithms for
4-CSP resolution based on the positive linear dependence theory, the hypergraph
closure and the constraint propagation technique. Time and space complexities
of the resolution algorithms are proved to be polynomial.

plane of the Solar system by about 6 degrees. This obliquity significantly
exceeds the ~1-2 degree distribution of inclinations among the planetary orbits
and therefore requires a physical explanation. In concert, Sun-like stars are
known to spin down by an order of magnitude throughout their lifetimes. This
spin-down is driven by the stellar wind, which carries angular momentum from
the star. If the mean angular momentum axis of the stellar wind deviates from
that of the stellar spin axis, it will lead to a component of the spin-down
torque that acts to tilt the star. Here, we show that Solar-like tilts of 6
degrees naturally arise during the first 10-100 Myr after planet formation as a
result of stellar winds that deviate by about 10 degrees from the star's spin
axis. These results apply to the idealized case of a dipolar field, mildly
inclined to the spin axis. Time-variability in the misalignment between the
magnetic and spin poles is modeled as stochastic fluctuations, autocorrelated
over timescales comparable to the primordial spin-down time of several million
years. In addition to wind direction, time-variability in mass-loss rate and
magnetic topology over the stellar lifetime may alternatively generate
obliquity. We hypothesize that the gaseous environments of young, open clusters
may provide forcing over sufficient timescales to tilt the astrospheres of
young stars, exciting modest obliquities. The more extreme, retrograde stellar
obliquities of extrasolar planetary systems likely arise through separate
mechanisms.

distributions are therefore adiabatic. This assumption is also often applied to
exoplanets. However, if a large portion of the thermal flux can be transferred
by conduction, or if convection is inhibited, the thermal profile could be
substantially different and would therefore affect the inferred planetary
composition. Here we investigate how the assumption of non-adiabatic
temperature profiles in Uranus and Neptune affects their internal structures
and compositions. We use a set of plausible temperature profiles together with
density profiles that match the measured gravitational fields to derive the
planets' compositions. We find that the inferred compositions of both Uranus

layers, but relatively insensitive to the thermal profile in the central, high
pressure region. The overall value of the heavy element mass fraction, $Z$, for
these planets is between 0.8 and 0.9. Finally, we suggest that large parts of

  In this paper, we propose ConTExT, a Considerate Transient Execution

not transiently leave them. ConTExT transforms Spectre from a problem that
cannot be solved purely in software [53], to a problem that is not easy to
solve, but solvable in software. For this, ConTExT requires minimal
modifications of applications, compilers, operating systems, and the hardware.
ConTExT offers full protection for secrets in memory and secrets in registers.
We evaluate the security and performance of ConTExT. With its principled
approach it inherently mitigates the recently found microarchitectural data
sampling attacks on small processor buffers. Even when over-approximating, we
observe no performance overhead for unprotected code and data, and an overhead
of 71.14% for security-critical applications, which is below the overhead of
currently recommended state-of-the-art mitigation strategies. The actual
overhead of ConTExT is below 1% for real-world workloads.

neglects these shifts in case of a variable oxygen amount, taking [C-O] instead

trial distribution is `wrapped' around the domain of the posterior distribution

enhances the mobility of the sampler. For parameters which represent
coordinates on the surface of a sphere, the algorithm transforms the parameters
into a Cartesian coordinate system before sampling which again makes sure no

pre-train models on images from a different domain and then fine-tune them on

pre-trained on the ImageNet database for object recognition. It remains a

to achieve a low error rate. However, it impedes SCL decoding from achieving a
high throughput as the computational complexity is very high when a large list
size is used. In this paper, we propose a two-staged adaptive SCL (TA-SCL)

of $\Gamma$-convergence, it is shown that in the asymptotic limit dopant-dopant
interactions are negligable, the Frank constants and nematic host order
parameter are unperturbed by the presence of dopant, but the mirror asymmetry
of the dopant-host interaction leads to a macroscopically twisted ground state.

064041 (2018), arXiv:1809.01993] in several significant ways. To begin with,
the extra spatial dimension is assumed to be time dependent, while the redshift
and shape functions, as well as the extra dimension, are functions of both $r$
and $l$, the respective radial and extra coordinates. The main goal is to
determine the conditions that allow the throat of the wormhole to be threaded
with ordinary matter (by respecting the null energy condition) and that the
same conditions lead to a violation of the null energy condition in the fifth
dimension, which can therefore be credited with helping to sustain the
wormhole. The dependence of the metric coefficients on $l$ and time $t$ may
either help or hinder the ability to use ordinary matter, while an unrestricted

time-averaged acoustic energy flux density in the bulk of a viscous fluid. In
simple cases, like the one-dimensional single standing-wave resonance, this
energy flux is negligible, and therefore the bulk-driven streaming is often
ignored relative to the boundary-driven (Rayleigh) streaming in the analysis of
resonating acoustofluidic devices with length scales comparable to the acoustic
wavelength. However, in closed acoustic microcavities with viscous dissipation,
two overlapping resonances may be excited at the same frequency as a double
mode. In contrast to single modes, the double modes can support a steady
rotating acoustic energy flux density and thus a corresponding rotating
bulk-driven acoustic streaming. We derive analytical solutions for the double
modes in a rectangular box-shaped cavity including the viscous boundary layers,
and use them to map out possible rotating patterns of bulk-driven acoustic
streaming. Remarkably, the rotating bulk-driven streaming may be excited by a
non-rotating actuation, and we determine the optimal geometry that maximizes
this excitation. In the optimal geometry, we finally simulate a horizontal
2-by-2, 4-by-4, and 6-by-6 streaming-roll pattern in a shallow square cavity.
We find that the high-frequency 6-by-6 streaming-roll pattern is dominated by
the bulk-driven streaming as opposed to the low-frequency 2-by-2 streaming
pattern, which is dominated by the boundary-driven streaming.

7$\times10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 0.3 -- 8.0 keV energy range by assuming a
power-law spectral model with a photon index of 1.7. We detected 55 X-ray

some of the sources possess a bimodal luminosity-hardness ratio feature, which
is often observed among X-ray binaries. Nine more ultra-luminous X-ray sources
are found comparing to previous studies and 8 are likely to be low-mass or
high-mass XRBs. Twenty-one optical counterpart candidates are found based on
the Hubble Space Telescope images, but we cannot rule out the possibility of
positional coincidence. The spectral analysis of SN 2014C shows a trend of

obfuscation techniques are successfully used to protect the intellectual

cybercriminals to hide malicious content inside mobile apps and to deceive
malware detection tools. As a consequence, most of mobile malware detection
approaches fail in differentiating between benign and obfuscated malicious
apps. We examine the graph features of mobile apps code by building weighted
directed graphs of the API calls, and verify that malicious apps often share
structural similarities that can be used to differentiate them from benign
apps, even under a heavily ""polluted"" training set where a large majority of

superconducting wires have been proposed as the building blocks of novel,

manipulation of such states in scalable devices are, therefore, essential in
these applications. Recent detection proposals include semiconductor quantum
dots (QDs) coupled to the end of these wires, as changes in the QD electronic
spectral density due to the MZM coupling could be detected in transport
experiments. Here, we propose that multi-QD systems can also be used to
manipulate MZMs through precise control over the QDs' parameters. The simplest
case where Majorana manipulation is possible is in a double quantum dot (DQD)

calculations, we show that the QDs' spectral functions can be used to
characterize the presence or not of MZMs ""leaking"" into the DQD. More
importantly, we find that these signatures respond to changes in the DQD
parameters such as gate-voltages and couplings in a consistent fashion.
Additionally, we show that different MZM-DQD coupling geometries (""symmetric"" ,

switched from dot to dot. These results highlight the interesting possibilities

the polymorphous networks have lower predicted total energies (enhanced
stability), larger band gaps and dielectric constants now dominated by the
ionic part, and agrees much more closely with the observed pair distribution

satellite images is used to refine the orientations or most often used
geometric parameters Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPC) of each satellite
image in a unified geodetic framework, which is very critical in many
photogrammetry and computer vision applications. However, the growing number of
high resolution spaceborne optical sensors has brought two challenges to the
bundle adjustment: 1) images come from different satellite cameras may have
different imaging dates, viewing angles, resolutions, etc., thus resulting in
geometric and radiometric distortions in the bundle adjustment; 2) The
large-scale mapping area always corresponds to vast number of bundle adjustment
corrections (including RPC bias and object space point coordinates). Due to the
limitation of computer memory, it is hard to refine all corrections at the same
time. Hence, how to efficiently realize the bundle adjustment in large-scale
regions is very important. This paper particularly addresses the multi-view
large-scale bundle adjustment problem by two steps: 1) to get robust tie points

point matching algorithm based on plane rectification and epipolar constraints,
which is able to compensate geometric and local nonlinear radiometric
distortions among satellite datasets, and 2) to solve dozens of thousands or

excitation with water saturation and typically focus on upfield signals. By
contrast, the downfield spectrum, which contains many potentially useful
resonances, is typically not targeted because conventional water-suppressed
techniques indirectly saturate the labile protons through exchange.
Relaxation-enhanced MRS (RE-MRS) uses frequency-selective excitation while
actively avoiding bulk water perturbation, thereby enabling high-quality
downfield spectroscopy. However, RE-MRS typically requires very long (typically
>40 ms) echo times (TEs) due to its localization module, which inevitably
decreases sensitivity and filters shorter T2 components. Here, we overcome this
limitation by combining RE-MRS and image selected in vivo spectroscopy (ISIS)
localization, abbreviated iRE-MRS, which in turn allows very short TEs (5 ms
using our hardware).
  Methods: Experiments were performed in vitro for validation as well as and in
in vivo rat brains at 9.4T.
  Results: The new iRE-MRS methodology was validated in phantoms where good
performance was noted. When the downfield spectrum was investigated at short
TEs in in vivo rat brains, iRE-MRS provided very high sensitivity; the ensuing
downfield spectra encompassed numerous broad peaks, as well as a broad
baseline. All downfield spectral peaks were highly attenuated by increasing TEs
as well as by applying water saturation, although to different extent. The
signal ratios also varied between TEs, suggesting that exchange rates are
different among the downfield signals.
  Conclusions: Short-TE iRE 1H downfield MRS opens new directions in the
investigation of in vivo downfield metabolites and their role on healthy and
disease processes.

poisoning attack on biometric systems that allows adversaries to stealthily and
effortlessly impersonate users in the long-term by exploiting the template
update procedure. We show that such attacks can be carried out even by
attackers with physical limitations (no digital access to the sensor) and zero
knowledge of training data (they know neither decision boundaries nor user
template). Based on the adversaries' own templates, they craft several
intermediate samples that incrementally bridge the distance between their own
template and the legitimate user's. As these adversarial samples are added to
the template, the attacker is eventually accepted alongside the legitimate
user. To avoid detection, we design the attack to minimize the number of
rejected samples.
  We design our method to cope with the weak assumptions for the attacker and
we evaluate the effectiveness of this approach on state-of-the-art face
recognition pipelines based on deep neural networks. We find that in scenarios
where the deep network is known, adversaries can successfully carry out the
attack over 70% of cases with less than ten injection attempts. Even in
black-box scenarios, we find that exploiting the transferability of adversarial
samples from surrogate models can lead to successful attacks in around 15% of
cases. Finally, we design a poisoning detection technique that leverages the
consistent directionality of template updates in feature space to discriminate
between legitimate and malicious updates. We evaluate such a countermeasure
with a set of intra-user variability factors which may present the same
directionality characteristics, obtaining equal error rates for the detection
between 7-14% and leading to over 99% of attacks being detected after only two
sample injections.

in detail, the longitudinal sector of the quasi-normal modes at zero charge
density. We identify three hydrodynamic modes in this sector: a pair of sound
modes and one diffusion mode. We numerically compute the dispersion relations
of the hydrodynamic modes. The obtained speed and the attenuation of the sound
modes are in agreement with the hydrodynamic predictions. On the contrary, we
surprisingly find disagreement in the case of the diffusive mode; its diffusion
constant extracted from the quasi-normal mode data does not agree with the
expectations from hydrodynamics. We confirm our numerical results using
analytic tools in the decoupling limit and we comment on some possible reasons

longitudinal modes beyond the hydrodynamic limit by displaying the dynamics of
the higher quasi-normal modes at large frequencies and momenta.

crystal structure. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and PBE revised for solids

on-site Coulomb interaction (GGA$+U$) is unnecessary to produce a
semiconducting state in the distorted polar $R3m$ phase. Plus Hubbard $U$
values ranging from 1$\sim$2 eV, however, improve the quantitative performance
of the GGA functionals. The meta-GGA functional SCAN predicts reasonable
lattice constants and electronic structures; it exhibits behavior similar to
the GGA$+U$ functionals for small $U$ values. The hybrid functional HSE06 is
accurate in predicting the lattice constants, but leads to a band gap of
$\approx$1 eV in the rhombohedral phase, which is higher than the experimental

strongly on the spin-down evolution of the pulsar companion, which in turn
depends on the merging timescale of the system. If this evacuated region is
able to grow to a sufficiently large scale, then the deceleration of the jet,
and thus the onset of the afterglow, would be noticeably delayed. The first
detection of afterglow emission, which was uncovered 9.2 days after the
$\gamma$-ray burst trigger, can thus be used to constrain the size of a
pre-existing pulsar-wind cavity. We use this information, together with a model
of the jet to place limits on the presence of a pulsar in GW170817 and discuss
the derived constraints in the context of the observed double neutron star

textual representation, they are often presented as conditions, i.e.,
expressions which are easily combined with other conditions (often via Boolean
combinators) to form new conditions, though they only play a supporting role in
aiding branching statements choose a branch to follow. On the other hand, in
the graphical representation they are typically presented as decisions,
intrinsically capable of directing control flow yet mostly oblivious to Boolean
combination. While categorical treatments of flowchart languages are abundant,
none of them provide a treatment of this dual nature of predicates. In the
present paper, we argue that extensive restriction categories are precisely
categories that capture such a condition/decision duality, by means of
morphisms which, coincidentally, are also called decisions. Further, we show
that having these categorical decisions amounts to having an internal logic:
Analogous to how subobjects of an object in a topos form a Heyting algebra, we
show that decisions on an object in an extensive restriction category form a De
Morgan quasilattice, the algebraic structure associated with the (three-valued)
weak Kleene logic $\mathbf{K}^w_3$. Full classical propositional logic can be
recovered by restricting to total decisions, yielding extensive categories in
the usual sense, and confirming (from a different direction) a result from
effectus theory that predicates on objects in extensive categories form Boolean
algebras. As an application, since (categorical) decisions are partial
isomorphisms, this approach provides naturally reversible models of classical
propositional logic and weak Kleene logic.

impurity effects in topological nodal-line semimetals based on the T-matrix

robust resonant impurity states exist in a wide range of impurity potentials.

to be made in spite of the large number of options available at each time. We
present GrAPL, a novel algorithm for the thresholding graph bandit problem. We
demonstrate theoretically that this algorithm is effective in taking advantage

strongly connected arms have similar rewards) when favorable. We confirm these
theoretical findings via experiments on both synthetic and real data.

energy physics community for centuries, and their search has gained momentum as
recent models predict these may be observable at current colliders. They appear
in field theories in two forms: the widely studied but heavily suppressed
monopole with structure (soliton) and the not-so-well-covered point-like
monopole. The latter was first proposed by Dirac as the source of a singular
magnetic field and in effect symmetrises Maxwell's equations. Following this
line of research, work by S. Baines et al. analysed these sources as matter
fields that carry spins 0, $\frac{1}{2}$, or 1, in an effective field theory
that is perturbative for monopoles produced at threshold where the coupling
strength $g(\beta)$ is suppressed. All three cases are currently under
investigation by the MoEDAL collaboration at CERN, and the theoretical
expressions for kinematic distributions proposed in this work serve as guides
to these searches. The cross section distributions in each case are derived
from a \emph{U}(1) invariant gauge theory. It is not assumed that, like the
electron, the monopole's magnetic moment is generated through spin interactions
at minimal coupling, as it may be quite large. Instead, the analytical
expressions in the spin $\frac{1}{2}$ and $1$ cases are kept completely general
through the inclusion of a phenomenological parameter $\kappa$, related to the
gyromagnetic ratio $g_R=1+\kappa$. In fact, the inclusion of this parameter
gives the effective theory validity in the high energy limit if the magnetic
coupling scales with the particle's velocity $\beta=\frac{v}{c}$.

Normally, such LD models are constrained only by the measured $D_0$, i.e. the
density of levels at the neutron separation energy of the compound nucleus
(target plus neutron), and the sometimes subjective extrapolation of discrete
levels. In this work we use microscopic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) level

observed double-differential cross sections at low outgoing neutron energy,
region that is dominated by the LD input. With this approach we are able to
perform fits of the LD based on actual experimental data, constraining the
model and ensuring its consistency. This approach can be particularly useful in
extrapolating the LD to nuclei for which high-excited discrete levels and/or

learning and has shown superiority to other common procedures such as kernel
methods. To provide a better theoretical understanding of the reasons for its
success, we discuss the performance of deep learning and other methods on a
nonparametric regression problem with a Gaussian noise. Whereas existing
theoretical studies of deep learning have been based mainly on mathematical
theories of well-known function classes such as H\""{o}lder and Besov classes,
we focus on function classes with discontinuity and sparsity, which are those
naturally assumed in practice. To highlight the effectiveness of deep learning,
we compare deep learning with a class of linear estimators representative of a
class of shallow estimators. It is shown that the minimax risk of a linear
estimator on the convex hull of a target function class does not differ from
that of the original target function class. This results in the suboptimality
of linear methods over a simple but non-convex function class, on which deep
learning can attain nearly the minimax-optimal rate. In addition to this
extreme case, we consider function classes with sparse wavelet coefficients. On
these function classes, deep learning also attains the minimax rate up to log
factors of the sample size, and linear methods are still suboptimal if the
assumed sparsity is strong. We also point out that the parameter sharing of
deep neural networks can remarkably reduce the complexity of the model in our
setting.

immersed interfaces (possibly evolving in time), it is often desirable to
approximate the problem using an independent background discretisation, not
aligned with the interface itself. Optimal convergence rates are possible if
the discretisation scheme is enriched by allowing the discrete solution to have
jumps aligned with the surface, at the cost of a higher complexity in the
implementation.
  A much simpler way to reformulate immersed interface problems consists in
replacing the interface by a singular force field that produces the desired
interface conditions, as done in immersed boundary methods. These methods are
known to have inferior convergence properties, depending on the global
regularity of the solution across the interface, when compared to enriched
methods.
  In this work we prove that this detrimental effect on the convergence
properties of the approximate solution is only a local phenomenon, restricted
to a small neighbourhood of the interface. In particular we show that optimal
approximations can be constructed in a natural and inexpensive way, simply by
reformulating the problem in a distributionally consistent way, and by
resorting to weighted norms when computing the global error of the
approximation.

regions. The radial intensity profile resembles well the inner regions of more
extended disks imaged at the same resolution in DSHARP, but with no rings
present in the outer disk. No inner cavity is detected, even though the disk
has been classified as a transition disk from the spectral energy distribution
in the near infrared. The emission of $^{12}$CO is much more extended, with a
68$\%$ enclosing flux radius of 75$\,$AU. The large difference of the mm dust
and gas extents ($>5$) strongly points to the occurrence of radial drift, and
matches well the predictions of theoretical models.

machine learning to their bioinformatics data due to a lack of machine learning
and/or coding expertise. Methods that have been proposed thus far to automate
machine learning mostly require programming experience as well as expert
knowledge to tune and apply the algorithms correctly. Here, we study a method
of automating biomedical data science using a web-based platform that uses AI
to recommend model choices and conduct experiments. We have two goals in mind:
first, to make it easy to construct sophisticated models of biomedical
processes; and second, to provide a fully automated AI agent that can choose
and conduct promising experiments for the user, based on the user's experiments
as well as prior knowledge. To validate this framework, we experiment with
hundreds of classification problems, comparing to state-of-the-art, automated
approaches. Finally, we use this tool to develop predictive models of septic
shock in critical care patients.
  Results: We find that matrix factorization-based recommendation systems
outperform meta-learning methods for automating machine learning. This result
mirrors the results of earlier recommender systems research in other domains.
The proposed AI is competitive with state-of-the-art automated machine learning
methods in terms of choosing optimal algorithm configurations for datasets. In
our application to prediction of septic shock, the AI-driven analysis produces
a competent machine learning model (AUROC 0.85 +/- 0.02) that performs on par
with state-of-the-art deep learning results for this task, with much less
computational effort.

Method: Our study is based on near-infrared (YJH, 0.95-1.650 um, R=350)
long-slit spectroscopy observations of the central region of NGC 1068 with a
0.4"" spatial resolution. We decomposed the observed continuum emission into
three components: hot dust, stars, and scattered light from the central engine.
We measured their contributions at various distances from the nucleus. We also
measured fluxes and Doppler shifts for the emission lines in our spectrum to
probe the physical conditions of the narrow line region. Results: Dust and
stars are the main sources of continuum emission, but scattered light from the
central engine has also been detected in the very central region. Together,
these three components reproduce the observed continuum well. The dust emission
is compatible with a 830~K blackbody. It has only been detected in the very
central region and is not spatially resolved. The stellar content is
ubiquitous. It harbours a 250 pc cusp centred around the nucleus, over-imposed
on a young stellar background. The spectrum of the cusp is consistent with a
120 Myr old single stellar population. Finally, the emission lines exhibit a
significant Doppler shift that is consistent with a radial outflow from the
nucleus in a biconical structure. The $\left[Fe\ II\right]$ behaviour strongly
differs from other lines, indicating that it arises from a different structure.

neutral stability that is deduced by an examination of exponential modes of the
form $h\approx {{e}^{i(kx-\omega t)}}$, where $h$ is a response to a
disturbance, $k$ is a real wavenumber, and $\omega(k)$ is a
wavelength-dependent complex frequency. In a previous paper, King et al
(Stability of algebraically unstable dispersive flows, \textit{Phys. Rev.

it is possible for a system response to grow or damp algebraically as $h\approx
{{t}^{s}}$ where $s$ is a fractional power. The growth is deduced through an
asymptotic analysis of the Fourier integral that inherently invokes the
superposition of an infinite number of modes. In this paper, the more typical
case associated with the transition from stability to instability is examined
in which Im$[\omega(k)]$=0 for a single mode (i.e., for one value of $k$) at
neutral stability. Two partial differential equation systems are examined, one
that has been constructed to elucidate key features of the stability threshold,

  Needle Insertion","Accepted for publication in the International Journal of Computer
  Assisted Radiology and Surgery",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose. Precise placement of needles is a challenge in a number of clinical
applications such as brachytherapy or biopsy. Forces acting at the needle cause
tissue deformation and needle deflection which in turn may lead to misplacement
or injury. Hence, a number of approaches to estimate the forces at the needle
have been proposed. Yet, integrating sensors into the needle tip is challenging
and a careful calibration is required to obtain good force estimates.
  Methods. We describe a fiber-optical needle tip force sensor design using a
single OCT fiber for measurement. The fiber images the deformation of an epoxy
layer placed below the needle tip which results in a stream of 1D depth
profiles. We study different deep learning approaches to facilitate calibration
between this spatio-temporal image data and the related forces. In particular,
we propose a novel convGRU-CNN architecture for simultaneous spatial and
temporal data processing.
  Results. The needle can be adapted to different operating ranges by changing
the stiffness of the epoxy layer. Likewise, calibration can be adapted by
training the deep learning models. Our novel convGRU-CNN architecture results
in the lowest mean absolute error of 1.59 +- 1.3 mN and a cross-correlation
coefficient of 0.9997, and clearly outperforms the other methods. Ex vivo
experiments in human prostate tissue demonstrate the needle's application.
  Conclusions. Our OCT-based fiber-optical sensor presents a viable alternative
for needle tip force estimation. The results indicate that the rich
spatio-temporal information included in the stream of images showing the
deformation throughout the epoxy layer can be effectively used by deep learning
models. Particularly, we demonstrate that the convGRU-CNN architecture performs
favorably, making it a promising approach for other spatio-temporal learning
problems.

(TDEs), when the tidal force across the star exceeds the gravitational force
that binds it. TDEs have usually been discussed in relation to massive black
holes that reside in the centres of galaxies or lurk in star clusters. In this
paper, we investigate the possibility that triple stars hosting a stellar black
hole (SBH) may be sources of TDEs. We start from a triple system made up of
three main sequence (MS) stars and model the supernova (SN) kick event that led
to the production of an inner binary comprised of a SBH. We evolve these
triples in isolation with a high precision $N$-body code and study their TDEs
as a result of Kozai-Lidov oscillations. We explore a variety of distributions
of natal kicks imparted during the SN event, various maximum initial
separations for the triples, and different distributions of eccentricities. We
show that the main parameter that governs the properties of the SBH-MS binaries
which produce a TDE in triples is the mean velocity of the natal kick
distribution. Smaller $\sigma$'s lead to larger inner and outer semi-major axes
of the systems that undergo a TDE, smaller SBH masses, and longer timescales.
We find that the fraction of systems that produce a TDE is roughly independent
of the initial conditions, while estimate a TDE rate of $7.3\times 10^{-5}-4.1
\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, depending on the prescriptions adopted for the SBH natal
kicks. This rate is almost comparable to the expected TDE rate for massive
black holes.

mental disorders and neurological abnormalities. Enhanced analysis and

leveraging knowledge of spatial layout of EEG sensors. Performance of two
classification models - model 1 that ignores the sensor layout and model 2 that
factors it in - is investigated and found to achieve consistently higher
detection accuracy. The analysis is based on the information content of these
signals represented in two different ways: concatenation of the channels of the
frequency bands and an image-like 2D representation of the EEG channel
locations. Performance of these models is examined on two tasks, social anxiety
disorder (SAD) detection, and emotion recognition using a dataset for emotion
analysis using physiological signals (DEAP). We hypothesized that model 2 will
significantly outperform model 1 and this was validated in our results as model
2 yielded $5$--$8\%$ higher accuracy in all machine learning algorithms
investigated. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) provided the best performance
far exceeding that of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors

both based on Machine Learning, exploited together with binomial trees or with
a closed formula for integration. Moreover, these two methods solve the
backward dynamic programming problem considering a Bermudan approximation of
the American option. On the exercise dates, the value of the option is first
computed as the maximum between the exercise value and the continuation value
and then approximated by means of Gaussian Process Regression. The two methods
mainly differ in the approach used to compute the continuation value: a single
step of binomial tree or integration according to the probability density of
the process. Numerical results show that these two methods are accurate and
reliable in handling American options on very large baskets of assets. Moreover
we also consider the rough Bergomi model, which provides stochastic volatility
with memory. Despite this model is only bidimensional, the whole history of the
process impacts on the price, and handling all this information is not obvious
at all. To this aim, we present how to adapt the GPR-Tree and GPR-EI methods

gravitational strength to all baryonic matter. The gravitational coupling
strength is determined by the MOG parameter $\alpha$, while parameter $\mu$ is
the small effective mass of $\phi_\mu$. The MOG acceleration law has been
demonstrated to fit a wide range of galaxies, galaxy clusters and the Bullet
Cluster and Train Wreck Cluster mergers. For the SPARC sample of rotationally
supported spiral and irregular galaxies, McGaugh et al. [24] (MLS) have found a

notions of functions being contractive in these spaces and structures. As a
sample of possible applications we discuss metric spaces, ultrametric spaces,
ordered groups and fields, topological spaces, partially ordered sets, and
lattices. We describe several notions of completeness in these spaces and
structures and determine their respective strengths. In order to illustrate
some consequences of the levels of strength, we give examples of generic fixed
point theorems which then can be specialized to theorems in various
applications which work with contracting functions and some completeness
property of the underlying space.
  Ball spaces are nonempty sets of nonempty subsets of a given set. They are
called spherically complete if every chain of balls has a nonempty
intersection. This is all that is needed for the encoding of completeness
notions. We discuss operations on the sets of balls to determine when they lead
to larger sets of balls; if so, then the properties of the so obtained new ball
spaces are determined. The operations can lead to increased level of strength,
or to ball spaces of newly constructed structures, such as products. Further,
the general framework makes it possible to transfer concepts and approaches
from one application to the other; as examples we discuss theorems analogous to
the Knaster--Tarski Fixed Point Theorem for lattices and theorems analogous to
the Tychonoff Theorem for topological spaces.

density distribution at intermediate to high relative humidities is obtained
using a lattice gas density functional method together with a realistic
nano-granular model of cement hydrates. The calculated adsorption/desorption

determination from desorption data is evaluated. Then, the integration of the
Korteweg liquid stress field around each cement hydrate particle provided the
capillary forces at the nanoscale. The cement mesoscale structure was relaxed
under the action of the capillary forces. Local irreversible deformations of
the cement nano-grains assembly were identified due to liquid-solid
interactions. The spatial correlations of the nonaffine displacements extend to
a few tens of nm. Finally, the Love-Weber method provided the homogenized
liquid stress at the micronscale. The homogenization length coincided with the
spatial correlation length nonaffine displacements. Our results on the solid

rotational Brownian motion causes the behavior of the self-propelled
nanoparticles to resemble Brownian diffusion with an effective coefficient that
is larger than the standard Brownian value by a factor of several thousand. As
a result of the enhanced diffusion (and the convective mixing resulting from
the motion), we observe a discriminable increase of the effective thermal
conductivity of the solution. While the increases we observe are in the range
of several percent, they are significant considering that, without propulsion,
the nanofluid thermal conductivity is essentially not affected by the Brownian
motion and can be understood within the effective medium theory of thermal
conduction. Our results constitute a proof of concept that self-propelled
particles have the potential to enhance thermal conductivity of the liquid in
which they are immersed, an idea that could ultimately be implemented in a
broad variety of cooling applications.

manually, which may be laborious and expertise-dependent. In this paper, we
propose an interactive insight identification and annotation framework by
leveraging an enhanced variational autoencoder (VAE). In particular, a new
architecture, DenseU-Hierarchical VAE (DUHiV), is designed to learn
representations from large-sized PGPMs, which achieves a significantly tighter
evidence lower bound (ELBO) than existing Hierarchical VAEs with a Multilayer
Perceptron architecture. Our approach supports modulating the derived

end-users enabling the deployment of some application component in the fog
while others in the cloud. Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) decouples the
network functions from the underlying hardware. In NFV settings, application
components can be implemented as sets of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs)
chained in specific order representing VNF-Forwarding Graphs (VNF-FG). Many
studies have been carried out to map the VNF-FGs to cloud systems. However, in
hybrid cloud/fog systems, an additional challenge arises. The mobility of fog
nodes may cause high latency as the distance between the end-users and the
nodes hosting the components increases. This may not be tolerable for some
applications. In such cases, a prominent solution is to migrate application
components to a closer fog node. This paper focuses on application component
migration in NFV-based hybrid cloud/fog systems. The objective is to minimize
the aggregated makespan of the applications. The problem is modeled
mathematically, and a heuristic is proposed to find the sub-optimal solution in
an acceptable time. The heuristic aims at finding the optimal fog node in each
time-slot considering a pre-knowledge of the mobility models of the fog nodes.
The experiment's results show that our proposed solution improves the makespan
and the number of migrations compared to random migration and No-migration.

subject-specific disease risk with competing risk outcome. With longitudinally
collected biomarker data, it is of interest to dynamically update the predicted
CIF by incorporating the most recent biomarker as well as the cumulating
longitudinal history. Motivated by a longitudinal cohort study of chronic
kidney disease, we propose a framework for dynamic prediction of end stage
renal disease using multivariate longitudinal biomarkers, accounting for the
competing risk of death. The proposed framework extends the landmark survival
modeling to competing risks data, and implies that a distinct sub-distribution
hazard regression model is defined at each landmark time. The model parameters,
prediction horizon, longitudinal history and at-risk population are allowed to
vary over the landmark time. When the measurement times of biomarkers are
irregularly spaced, the predictor variable may not be observed at the time of
prediction. Local polynomial is used to estimate the model parameters without
explicitly imputing the predictor or modeling its longitudinal trajectory. The
proposed model leads to simple interpretation of the regression coefficients
and closed-form calculation of the predicted CIF. The estimation and prediction
can be implemented through standard statistical software with tractable
computation. We conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of the
estimation procedure and predictive accuracy. The methodology is illustrated
