dynamically tunable optical properties. Here, we investigate the active control
of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) analogue based on terahertz
(THz) metamaterials integrated with vanadium oxide (VO2). Utilizing the
insulator-to-metal transition of VO2, the amplitude of EIT peak can be actively
modulated with a significant modulation depth. Meanwhile the group delay within
the transparent window can also be dynamically tuned, achieving the active
control of slow light effect. Furthermore, we also introduce independently
tunable transparent peaks as well as group delay based on a double-peak EIT
with good tuning performance. Finally, based on broadband EIT, the active
tuning of quality factor of the EIT peak is also realized. This work introduces
active EIT control with more degree of freedom by employing VO2, and can find
potential applications in future wireless and ultrafast THz communication
systems as multi-channel filters, switches, spacers, logic gates and
modulators.

transmissions for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communications, but its precoder
design is highly complicated. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid precoder
implementation, namely the double phase shifter (DPS) implementation, which
enables highly tractable hybrid precoder design. Efficient algorithms are then
developed for two popular hybrid precoder structures, i.e., the fully- and
partially-connected structures. For the fully-connected one, the RF-only
precoding and hybrid precoding problems are formulated as a least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) problem and a low-rank matrix
approximation problem, respectively. In this way, computationally efficient
algorithms are provided to approach the performance of the fully digital one
with a small number of radio frequency (RF) chains. On the other hand, the
hybrid precoder design in the partially-connected structure is identified as an
eigenvalue problem. To enhance the performance of this cost-effective
structure, dynamic mapping from RF chains to antennas is further proposed, for
which a greedy algorithm and a modified K-means algorithm are developed.
Simulation results demonstrate the performance gains of the proposed hybrid
precoding algorithms over existing ones. It shows that, with the proposed DPS
implementation, the fully-connected structure enjoys both satisfactory
performance and low design complexity while the partially-connected one serves
as an economic solution with low hardware complexity.

inducing the regions with high sample density in the feature space, which could
lead to locally sufficient samples for robust learning. We first formally show
that the softmax cross-entropy (SCE) loss and its variants convey inappropriate
supervisory signals, which encourage the learned feature points to spread over
the space sparsely in training. This inspires us to propose the Max-Mahalanobis
center (MMC) loss to explicitly induce dense feature regions in order to
benefit robustness. Namely, the MMC loss encourages the model to concentrate on
learning ordered and compact representations, which gather around the preset
optimal centers for different classes. We empirically demonstrate that applying
the MMC loss can significantly improve robustness even under strong adaptive

resembles the approach employed by modern metric learning methods, but it

performance. We show through experiments that our method outperforms the
existing methods on the evaluation test recently proposed by Shafaei et al.,

show that it achieves at least comparable performance to other methods on the

clustering. These models can often be improved by adapting them to the topology
of the data. For instance, in order to classify spatially adjacent data points
similarly, it is common to introduce a Laplacian constraint on the posterior
probability that each data point belongs to a class. Alternatively, the mixing
probabilities can be treated as free parameters, while assuming Gauss-Markov or
more complex priors to regularize those mixing probabilities. However, these
approaches are constrained by the shape of the prior and often lead to
complicated or intractable inference. Here, we propose a new parametrization of
the Dirichlet distribution to flexibly regularize the mixing probabilities of
over-parametrized mixture distributions. Using the Expectation-Maximization
algorithm, we show that our approach allows us to define any linear update rule
for the mixing probabilities, including spatial smoothing regularization as a
special case. We then show that this flexible design can be extended to share
class information between multiple mixture models. We apply our algorithm to
artificial and natural image segmentation tasks, and we provide quantitative
and qualitative comparison of the performance of Gaussian and Student-t
mixtures on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset. We also demonstrate how to
propagate class information across the layers of deep convolutional neural

electronic structure from which we compute the Tb crystal-field parameters and
construct an effective pseudospin Hamiltonian. Our calculations show that
ligand type and fine points of molecular geometry do not affect the zero-field

hand, higher-energy levels have a strong dependence on all these
characteristics. For neutral TbPc$_2$ and TbPcNc molecules, the Tb magnetic
moment and the ligand spin are parallel to each other and the coupling strength
between them does not depend much on ligand type and details of atomic
structure. However, ligand distortion and molecular symmetry play a crucial
role in transverse crystal-field parameters which lead to tunnel splitting. The
tunnel splitting induces quantum tunneling of magnetization by itself or by
combining with other processes. Our results provide insight into mechanisms of

of 32 recent galactic novae based on the time-stretching method for nova light
curves. A large part of the light/color curves of two classical novae often
overlap each other if we properly squeeze/stretch their timescales. Then, a
target nova brightness is related to the other template nova brightness by
$(M_V[t])_{\rm template} = (M_V[t/f_{\rm s}] - 2.5 \log f_{\rm s})_{\rm
target}$, where $t$ is the time, $M_V[t]$ is the absolute $V$ magnitude, and
$f_{\rm s}$ is their timescaling ratio. Moreover, when these two time-stretched
light curves, $(t/f_{\rm s})$-$(M_V-2.5 \log f_{\rm s})$, overlap each other,
$(t/f_{\rm s})$-$(B-V)_0$ do too, where $(B-V)_0$ is the intrinsic $B-V$ color.
Thus, the two nova tracks overlap each other in the $(B-V)_0$-$(M_V-2.5 \log
f_{\rm s})$ diagram. Inversely using these properties, we obtain/confirm the
distance and reddening by comparing each nova light/color curves with the well
calibrated template novae. We classify the 32 novae into two types, LV Vul and
V1500 Cyg types, in the time-stretched $(B-V)_0$-$(M_V-2.5 \log f_{\rm s})$
color-magnitude diagram. The WD mass is obtained by direct comparison of the
model $V$ light curves with the observation. Thus, we obtain a uniform set of
32 galactic classical novae that provides the distances and WD masses from a
single method. Many novae broadly follow the universal decline law and the
present method can be applied to them, while some novae largely deviate from
the universal decline law and so the method cannot be directly applied to them.
We discuss such examples.

new machine learning model, \texttt{plan-net}, based on an ensemble of Bayesian

additional insight by inferring the covariance of the retrieved atmospheric
parameters. We apply \texttt{plan-net} to the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field

obtain the relevant terms in some formulations has not been systematic enough

carried out. In this paper, we propose a systematic procedure to build the
beyond generalized theory for a Proca field in four dimensions containing only
the field itself and its first-order derivatives. We examine the validity of
our procedure at the fourth level of the generalized Proca theory. In our
approach, we employ all the possible Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian pieces made
of the Proca field and its first-order derivatives, including those that
violate parity, and find the relevant combination that propagates only three
degrees of freedom and has healthy dynamics for the longitudinal mode. The key
step in our procedure is to retain the flat space-time divergences of the
currents in the theory during the covariantization process. In the curved
space-time theory, some of the retained terms are no longer current divergences
so that they induce the new terms that identify the beyond generalized Proca
field theory. The procedure constitutes a systematic method to build general
theories for multiple vector fields with or without internal symmetries.

real-world systems as well as organizing the relations among entities. Network
embedding models are powerful tools in mapping nodes in a network into
continuous vector-space representations in order to facilitate subsequent tasks
such as classification and link prediction. Existing network embedding models
comprehensively integrate all information of each node, such as links and
attributes, towards a single embedding vector to represent the node's general
role in the network. However, a real-world entity could be multifaceted, where
it connects to different neighborhoods due to different motives or
self-characteristics that are not necessarily correlated. For example, in a
movie recommender system, a user may love comedies or horror movies
simultaneously, but it is not likely that these two types of movies are
mutually close in the embedding space, nor the user embedding vector could be
sufficiently close to them at the same time. In this paper, we propose a
polysemous embedding approach for modeling multiple facets of nodes, as
motivated by the phenomenon of word polysemy in language modeling. Each facet
of a node is mapped as an embedding vector, while we also maintain association
degree between each pair of node and facet. The proposed method is adaptive to
various existing embedding models, without significantly complicating the
optimization process. We also discuss how to engage embedding vectors of
different facets for inference tasks including classification and link
prediction. Experiments on real-world datasets help comprehensively evaluate
the performance of the proposed method.

Here we aim to measure the masses of the known transiting planets in this

spectrograph. We consider both trained and untrained Gaussian process
regression models of stellar activity to simultaneously model the RV data with
the planetary signals. Our RV analysis is then supplemented with dynamical
simulations to provide strong constraints on the planets' orbital
eccentricities by requiring long-term stability. We measure the planet masses
of the two outermost planets to be $2.46\pm 0.31$ and $2.26\pm 0.50$ Earth
masses which confirms their bulk terrestrial compositions. We are able to place
an upper limit on the mass of the smallest, innermost planet of $<0.98$ Earth
masses with 95% confidence. Our RV plus dynamical stability analysis places
strong constraints on the orbital eccentricities and reveals that each planet's
orbit likely has $e<0.1$ to ensure a dynamically stable system. The L 98-59

studies of planet formation, dynamical stability, and comparative atmospheric

Moreover, DCNNs trained on object recognition tasks are currently among the
best models we have of the mammalian visual system. This led us to hypothesize
that teaching DCNNs to achieve even more brain-like representations could
improve their performance. To test this, we trained DCNNs on a composite task,
wherein networks were trained to: a) classify images of objects; while b)
having intermediate representations that resemble those observed in neural
recordings from monkey visual cortex. Compared with DCNNs trained purely for
object categorization, DCNNs trained on the composite task had better object
recognition performance and are more robust to label corruption. Interestingly,
we also found that neural data was not required, but randomized data with the

  inferences from a randomized trial to a target population","first submission",,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Extending (generalizing or transporting) causal inferences from a randomized
trial to a target population requires ``generalizability'' or
``transportability'' assumptions, which state that randomized and
non-randomized individuals are exchangeable conditional on baseline covariates.
These assumptions are made on the basis of background knowledge, which is often
uncertain or controversial, and need to be subjected to sensitivity analysis.
We present simple methods for sensitivity analyses that do not require detailed
background knowledge about specific unknown or unmeasured determinants of the
outcome or modifiers of the treatment effect. Instead, our methods directly
parameterize violations of the assumptions using bias functions. We show how
the methods can be applied to non-nested trial designs, where the trial data
are combined with a separately obtained sample of non-randomized individuals,
as well as to nested trial designs, where a clinical trial is embedded within a
cohort sampled from the target population. We illustrate the methods using data
from a clinical trial comparing treatments for chronic hepatitis C infection.

over the character variety, which is then decomposed into cells, which look
like vector bundles over varieties associated to braids by
Shende-Treumann-Zaslow. These varieties are in turn decomposed into cells that
look like $(\mathbb{C}^*)^{d-2k}\times \mathbb{C}^k$. The curious Lefschetz
property is shown to hold on each cell, and therefore holds for the character
variety. To deduce the general case, we introduce a fictitious puncture with
trivial monodromy, and show that the cohomology of the character variety where
one puncture has trivial monodromy is isomorphic to the sign component of the
$S_n$ action on the cohomology for the character variety where trivial
monodromy is replaced by regular semisimple monodromy. This involves an
argument with the Grothendieck-Springer sheaf, and analysis of how the

strong relation between auditory and visual cues for guiding gaze during

the applicability of audio cues in conjunction with visual ones in predicting
saliency maps using deep neural networks. To this end, the proposed model is
intentionally designed to be simple. Two baseline models are developed on the
same architecture which consists of an encoder-decoder. The encoder projects
the input into a feature space followed by a decoder that infers saliency. We
conduct an extensive analysis on different modalities and various aspects of
multi-model dynamic saliency prediction. Our results suggest that (1) audio is
a strong contributing cue for saliency prediction, (2) salient visible
sound-source is the natural cause of the superiority of our Audio-Visual model,
(3) richer feature representations for the input space leads to more powerful
predictions even in absence of more sophisticated saliency decoders, and (4)

white-box targeted attacks. One scheme of learning attacks is to design a
proper adversarial objective function that leads to the imperceptible
perturbation for any test image (e.g., the Carlini-Wagner (C&W) method). Most
methods address targeted attacks in the Top-1 manner. In this paper, we propose
to learn ordered Top-k attacks (k>= 1) for image classification tasks, that is
to enforce the Top-k predicted labels of an adversarial example to be the k
(randomly) selected and ordered labels (the ground-truth label is exclusive).
To this end, we present an adversarial distillation framework: First, we
compute an adversarial probability distribution for any given ordered Top-k
targeted labels with respect to the ground-truth of a test image. Then, we
learn adversarial examples by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
together with the perturbation energy penalty, similar in spirit to the network
distillation method. We explore how to leverage label semantic similarities in
computing the targeted distributions, leading to knowledge-oriented attacks. In
experiments, we thoroughly test Top-1 and Top-5 attacks in the ImageNet-1000
validation dataset using two popular DNNs trained with clean ImageNet-1000
train dataset, ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121. For both models, our proposed
adversarial distillation approach outperforms the C&W method in the Top-1
setting, as well as other baseline methods. Our approach shows significant
improvement in the Top-5 setting against a strong modified C&W method.

representations. Translating embedding models (e.g., TransE) are among the most
popular latent distance approaches which use one distance function to learn
multiple relation patterns. However, they are mostly inefficient in capturing
symmetric relations since the representation vector norm for all the symmetric
relations becomes equal to zero. They also lose information when learning
relations with reflexive patterns since they become symmetric and transitive.
We propose the Multiple Distance Embedding model (MDE) that addresses these
limitations and a framework to collaboratively combine variant latent
distance-based terms. Our solution is based on two principles: 1) we use a
limit-based loss instead of a margin ranking loss and, 2) by learning
independent embedding vectors for each of the terms we can collectively train
and predict using contradicting distance terms. We further demonstrate that MDE
allows modeling relations with (anti)symmetry, inversion, and composition
patterns. We propose MDE as a neural network model that allows us to map
non-linear relations between the embedding vectors and the expected output of
the score function. Our empirical results show that MDE performs competitively
to state-of-the-art embedding models on several benchmark datasets.

it is advantageous to leverage similarities between patients, i.e. the
covariance of trajectories, and find a latent representation of progression.
Most of existing methods for estimating trajectories do not account for events

clinical practice. In this study, we develop a machine learning framework named
Coordinatewise-Soft-Impute (CSI) for analyzing disease progression from sparse

extracting a BH-spin signature is one of the grand challenges in astrophysics.
M87 is known as one of the best targets for imaging the BH shadow and it can be
partially thick against synchrotron self-absorption (SSA), particularly in a
flaring state with high mass accretion rate. However, little is known about
influences of the SSA-thick region on BH shadow images. Here we investigate BH
shadow images of M87 at 230 GHz properly taking into account the SSA-thick
region. When the BH has a high spin value, the corresponding BH shadow image
shows the positional offset between the center of the photon ring and that of
the SSA-thick ring at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) due to the
frame-dragging effect in the Kerr spacetime. As a result, we find that a
dark-crescent structure is generally produced between the photon ring and the
SSA-thick ISCO ring in the BH shadow image. The scale size of the dark-crescent
increase with BH spin: its width reaches up to $\sim 2$ gravitational radius
when the BH spin is 99.8% of its maximum value. The dark crescent is regarded
as a new signature of a highly spinning BH. This feature is expected to appear
in flaring states with relatively high mass accretion rate rather than the
quiescent states. We have simulated the image reconstruction of our theoretical
image by assuming the current and future Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) array,
and have found that the future EHT including space-very long baseline

question-answer interaction mechanisms, such as attention, to get vector
representations for answers. When these interaction based deep models are
deployed for online prediction, the representations of all answers need to be
recalculated for each question. This procedure is time-consuming for deep
models with complex encoders like BERT which usually have better accuracy than
simple encoders. One possible solution is to store the matrix representation

bring large memory cost. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called
hashing based answer selection (HAS), to tackle this problem. HAS adopts a
hashing strategy to learn a binary matrix representation for each answer, which
can dramatically reduce the memory cost for storing the matrix representations

the online prediction of HAS is still fast with a low memory cost. Experimental

outperform existing answer selection models to achieve state-of-the-art

  quantum computer",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Experimentally realizable quantum computers are rapidly approaching the
threshold of quantum supremacy. Quantum Hamiltonian simulation promises to be
one of the first practical applications for which such a device could
demonstrate an advantage over all classical systems. However, these early
devices will inevitably remain both noisy and small, precluding the use of
quantum error correction. We use high-performance classical tools to construct,
optimize, and simulate quantum circuits subject to realistic error models in
order to empirically determine the ""simulation capacity"" of near-term
simulation experiments implemented via quantum signal processing (QSP),
describing the relationship between simulation time, system size, and
resolution of QSP circuits which are optimally configured to balance
algorithmic precision and external noise. From simulation capacity models, we
estimate maximum tolerable error rate for meaningful simulation experiments on
a near-term quantum computer.
  By exploiting symmetry inherent to the QSP circuit, we further demonstrate
that its capacity for quantum simulation can be increased by at least two
orders of magnitude if errors are systematic and unitary. We find that a device
with $\epsilon^2=10^{-5}$ systematic amplitude errors could meaningfully
simulate systems up to $n\approx16$ with an expected failure rate below $10\%$,
whereas the largest system a device with a stochastic error rate of
$p_\epsilon=10^{-5}$ could meaningfully simulate with the same rate of failure
is between $n=3$ and $n=5$ (depending on the stochastic channel). Extrapolating
from empirical results, we estimate that one would typically need a stochastic
error rate below $p_\epsilon=10^{-8}$ to perform a meaningful $n=50$ simulation
experiment with a failure rate below $10\%$, while the same experiment could
tolerate systematic unitary errors with strength $\epsilon^2\approx10^{-6}$.

the seed, which now prevents crystallization. Hence, crystallization seeds
facilitate crystallization only during initial growth and then act as

degrade system performance. We jointly optimize the two-dimensional (2-D)

the total power consumption. The algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex
optimization problem taking into account the imperfect knowledge of the angle
of departure (AoD) caused by UAV jittering, user location uncertainty, wind
speed uncertainty, and polygonal no-fly zones (NFZs). Despite the non-convexity
of the optimization problem, we solve it optimally by employing monotonic
optimization theory and semidefinite programming relaxation which yields the
optimal 2-D trajectory and beamforming policy. Since the developed optimal
resource allocation algorithm entails a high computational complexity, we also
propose a suboptimal iterative low-complexity scheme based on successive convex
approximation to strike a balance between optimality and computational
complexity. Our simulation results reveal not only the significant power
savings enabled by the proposed algorithms compared to two baseline schemes,
but also confirm their robustness with respect to UAV jittering, wind speed
uncertainty, and user location uncertainty. Moreover, our results unveil that
the joint presence of wind speed uncertainty and NFZs has a considerable impact
on the UAV trajectory. Nevertheless, by counteracting the wind speed
uncertainty with the proposed robust design, we can simultaneously minimize the
total UAV power consumption and ensure a secure trajectory that does not
trespass any NFZ.

two-dimensional SOC exists in the dressed-state basis close to a Dirac point of

The interplay between synthetic SOC and interactions can potentially lead to
interesting few- and many-body phenomena but has so far eluded theoretical
attention. Here we study in detail properties of two-body bound states of such
a system. We find that, due to the competition between SOC and interaction, the
stability region of the two-body bound state is in general reduced.
Particularly, the threshold of the lowest two-body bound state is shifted to a
positive, SOC-dependent scattering length. Furthermore, the center-of-mass
momentum of the lowest two-body bound state becomes nonzero, suggesting the
emergence of Fulde-Ferrell pairing states in a many-body setting. Our results
reveal the critical difference between the experimentally realized

decreases with increase in density. The classical bulge hosting spirals and S0
galaxies follow a similar trend in less dense environments but towards higher
densities, we observe an increase in the fraction of classical bulge host S0
galaxies at the expense of spirals. Comparing the structural and the star
formation properties of galaxies on the size-mass and $NUV-r$ colour-mass

with environment such that the fraction of classical bulge hosting spiral

classical bulge hosting spirals, the fraction of quenched galaxies increases in
denser environments. We surmise that the existence of more classical bulge

increased occurrence of S0 galaxies in high density environments. The relation
between galaxy structure and environment also exists for the disc galaxies

into two stages, one that encodes an input image into a style independent

unique capability as well as superior output to the current state-of-the-art.

vulnerable when the source and target datasets are highly-complex or exhibit a

Lipschitz-constraint-based methods have been explored. The satisfaction of
Lipschitz continuity guarantees a remarkable performance on a target domain.
However, they lack a mathematical analysis of why a Lipschitz constraint is
beneficial to unsupervised domain adaptation and usually perform poorly on
large-scale datasets. In this paper, we take the principle of utilizing a
Lipschitz constraint further by discussing how it affects the error bound of
unsupervised domain adaptation. A connection between them is built and an
illustration of how Lipschitzness reduces the error bound is presented. A
\textbf{local smooth discrepancy} is defined to measure Lipschitzness of a
target distribution in a pointwise way. When constructing a deep end-to-end
model, to ensure the effectiveness and stability of unsupervised domain
adaptation, three critical factors are considered in our proposed optimization
strategy, i.e., the sample amount of a target domain, dimension and batchsize
of samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our model performs well on
several standard benchmarks. Our ablation study shows that the sample amount of
a target domain, the dimension and batchsize of samples indeed greatly impact

relevant source samples in the shared classes for knowledge transfer. Previous
PDA methods tackle this problem by re-weighting the source samples based on
their high-level information (deep features). However, since the domain shift
between source and target domains, only using the deep features for sample
selection is defective. We argue that it is more reasonable to additionally
exploit the pixel-level information for PDA problem, as the appearance
difference between outlier source classes and target classes is significantly
large. In this paper, we propose a reinforced transfer network (RTNet), which
utilizes both high-level and pixel-level information for PDA problem. Our RTNet
is composed of a reinforced data selector (RDS) based on reinforcement learning
(RL), which filters out the outlier source samples, and a domain adaptation
model which minimizes the domain discrepancy in the shared label space.
Specifically, in the RDS, we design a novel reward based on the reconstruct
errors of selected source samples on the target generator, which introduces the
pixel-level information to guide the learning of RDS. Besides, we develope a
state containing high-level information, which used by the RDS for sample
selection. The proposed RDS is a general module, which can be easily integrated
into existing DA models to make them fit the PDA situation. Extensive
experiments indicate that RTNet can achieve state-of-the-art performance for

Such face with very low-resolution is totally out of detail information of the

corresponding faces therein. To this end, we propose a Resolution Invariant
Model (RIM) for addressing such cross-resolution face recognition problems,
with three distinct novelties. First, RIM is a novel and unified deep
architecture, containing a Face Hallucination sub-Net (FHN) and a Heterogeneous

simultaneously perceives facial structure and geometry prior information, i.e.
landmark heatmaps and parsing maps, incorporated with an unsupervised
cross-domain adversarial training strategy to super-resolve very low-resolution
query image to its 8x larger ones without requiring them to be well aligned.
Third, HRN is a generic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for heterogeneous

learning discriminative yet generalized feature representation. Quantitative

fluctuations are temperature dependent trajectories whose amplitudes can be
spatially modulated according to the crowders distribution. We show that the

that, if the crowders mostly confine the DNA mid-chain, the helix over-twists

the crowders mostly pin one chain end, the helix untwists while the molecule
stretches for large confinement strengths. Thus, our results put forward a

turbulence which is considered as a candidate mechanism for coronal heating. We
review the modeling of tornado-like phenomena in the solar chromosphere and
corona as moving weakly twisted and spinning cylindrical flux tubes, showing
that the KHI rises at the excitation of high-mode MHD waves. The instability
occurs within a wavenumber range whose width depends on the MHD mode number
\emph{m}, the plasma density contrast between the rotating jet and its
environment, and also on the twists of the internal magnetic field and the jet
velocity. We have studied KHI in two twisted spinning solar polar coronal hole
jets, in a twisted rotating jet emerging from a filament eruption, and in a
rotating macrospicule. The theoretically calculated KHI development times of a
few minutes for wavelengths comparable to the half-widths of the jets are in
good agreement with the observationally determined growth times only for high
order (10 $\mathrm{\leqslant}$ \emph{m} $\mathrm{\leqslant}$ 65) MHD modes.
Therefore, we expect that the observed KHI in these cases is due to unstable

expected to have a shear viscosity close to a minimum bound, with an
inter-particle scattering rate saturating at the Planckian time $\hbar/(k_B

consistent with hydrodynamic electron flow in graphene, a ""smoking gun"" of
viscous behavior remains elusive. In this work, we directly image viscous Dirac

Scanning single-spin and wide-field magnetometry reveals a parabolic Poiseuille

is in contrast to the conventional uniform flow profile imaged in an Ohmic

universal values expected at quantum criticality. This finding establishes a
nearly-ideal electron fluid in neutral graphene at room temperature. Our

as well as operational uncertainties. The learning is divided into two phases:
offline (pre-)training and online (post-)training. In the former, a
conventional controller performs a set of trajectories and, based on the
input-output dataset, the deep neural network (DNN)-based controller is
trained. In the latter, the trained DNN, which mimics the conventional
controller, controls the system. Unlike the existing papers in the literature,
the network is still being trained for different sets of trajectories which are
not used in the training phase of DNN. Thanks to the rule-base, which contains
the expert knowledge, the proposed framework learns the system dynamics and
operational uncertainties in real-time. The experimental results show that the
proposed online learning-based approach gives better trajectory tracking
performance when compared to the only offline trained network.

suffers from the curse of dimensionality: one needs an exponential (wrt
dimension) number of samples to ensure that the distance between two empirical
measures is comparable to the distance between the original densities.
Therefore, optimal transport (OT) can only be used in machine learning if it is
substantially regularized. On the other hand, one of the greatest achievements
of the OT literature in recent years lies in regularity theory: Caffarelli
showed that the OT map between two well behaved measures is Lipschitz, or
equivalently when considering 2-Wasserstein distances, that Brenier convex
potentials (whose gradient yields an optimal map) are smooth. We propose in
this work to draw inspiration from this theory and use regularity as a
regularization tool. We give algorithms operating on two discrete measures that
can recover nearly optimal transport maps with small distortion, or
equivalently, nearly optimal Brenier potentials that are strongly convex and
smooth. The problem boils down to solving alternatively a convex QCQP and a
discrete OT problem, granting access to the values and gradients of the Brenier
potential not only on sampled points, but also out of sample at the cost of
solving a simpler QCQP for each evaluation. We propose algorithms to estimate
and evaluate transport maps with desired regularity properties, benchmark their
statistical performance, apply them to domain adaptation and visualize their
action on a color transfer task.

fraction of ICL in the core peaks in the F606W filter before decreasing with

particularly (but not solely) acute on oversubscribed systems (systems with

locks, three machines and three benchmarks shows that GCR brings substantial
speedup (in many cases, up to three orders of magnitude) in case of contention
and growing thread counts, while introducing nearly negligible slowdown when
the underlying lock is not contended. GCR-NUMA brings even larger performance

The purpose of
argument search is the distillation of pro and contra arguments for requested
topics from large text corpora. In previous works, the usual approach is to use
a standard search engine to extract text parts which are relevant to the given
topic and subsequently use an argument recognition algorithm to select
arguments from them. The main challenge in the argument recognition task, which
is also known as argument mining, is that often sentences containing arguments
are structurally similar to purely informative sentences without any stance
about the topic. In fact, they only differ semantically. Most approaches use
topic or search term information only for the first search step and therefore
assume that arguments can be classified independently of a topic. We argue that
topic information is crucial for argument mining, since the topic defines the
semantic context of an argument. Precisely, we propose different models for the
classification of arguments, which take information about a topic of an
argument into account. Moreover, to enrich the context of a topic and to let
models understand the context of the potential argument better, we integrate
information from different external sources such as Knowledge Graphs or
pre-trained NLP models. Our evaluation shows that considering topic
information, especially in connection with external information, provides a
significant performance boost for the argument mining task.

It connects a range of new devices to the Internet so they can communicate with

communicating Web pages and Web apps is JavaScript (JS) and extending the same
standard platform to connect IoT devices seems more than appropriate. However,
porting JS applications to the large variety of IoT devices, specifically on
System-on-a-Chip (SoCs) devices (\eg~Arduino Uno, Particle \photon), is
challenging because these devices are constrained in terms of memory and
storage capacity. Running JS applications adds an overhead of resources to
deploy a code interpreter on the devices. Also, running JS applications may not
be possible ``as is'' on some device missing some hardware/software
capabilities. To address this problem, we propose \momit~a multiobjective
optimization approach to miniaturize JS applications to run on IoT constrained
devices. To validate \momit, we miniaturize a JS interpreter to execute a
testbed comprised of 23 applications and measure their performances before and
after applying the miniaturization process. We implement \momit~using three
different search algorithms and found that it can reduce code size, memory
usage, and CPU time by median values of 31\%, 56\%, and 36\% respectively.
Finally, MoMIT ported the miniaturized JS interpreters up to to 2 SoCs

stability of the bridges. Existing methods to predict scour depth are mainly
based on regression models or black box models in which the first one lacks
enough accuracy while the later one does not provide a clear mathematical
expression to easily employ it for other situations or cases. Therefore, this
paper aims to develop new equations using particle swarm optimization as a
metaheuristic approach to predict scour depth around bridge piers. To improve
the efficiency of the proposed model, individual equations are derived for
laboratory and field data. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is conducted to
achieve the most effective parameters in the estimation of scour depth for both
experimental and filed data sets. Comparing the results of the proposed model
with those of existing regression-based equations reveal the superiority of the
proposed method in terms of accuracy and uncertainty. Moreover, the ratio of
pier width to flow depth and ratio of d50 (mean particle diameter) to flow
depth for the laboratory and field data were recognized as the most effective
parameters, respectively. The derived equations can be used as a suitable proxy
to estimate scour depth in both experimental and prototype scales.

is of critical importance, and yet is a challenging task. The coefficient of
consolidation for the compression index (Cc) is a key parameter in modeling the
settlement of fine-grained soil layers. However, the estimation of this
parameter is costly, time-consuming, and requires skilled technicians. To
overcome these drawbacks, we aimed to predict Cc through other soil parameters,
i.e., the liquid limit (LL), plastic limit (PL), and initial void ratio (e0).
Using these parameters is more convenient and requires substantially less time
and cost compared to the conventional tests to estimate Cc. This study presents
a novel prediction model for the Cc of fine-grained soils using gene expression
programming (GEP). A database consisting of 108 different data points was used
to develop the model. A closed-form equation solution was derived to estimate
Cc based on LL, PL, and e0. The performance of the developed GEP-based model
was evaluated through the coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean
squared error (RMSE), and the mean average error (MAE). The proposed model
performed better in terms of R2, RMSE, and MAE compared to the other models.
