response of a system as a function of frequency. Among its many applications in
Physics, Biology, Chemistry and other fields, the possibility of identifying
objects and structures through their emission spectra is remarkable and
incredibly useful. In this paper we apply the spectroscopy idea to a
numerically simulated hydrodynamical flow, with the goal of developing a new,
non-invasive flow measurement technique. Our focus lies on an irrotational
draining vortex, which can be seen, under specific conditions, as the analogue
of a rotating black hole (historically named a dumb hole). This paper is a
development of a recent experiment that suggests that irrotational vortices and
rotating black holes share a common relaxation process, known as the ringdown
phase. We apply techniques borrowed from black hole physics to identify vortex
flows from their characteristic spectrum emitted during this ringdown phase. We
believe that this technique is a new facet of the fluid-gravity analogy and
constitutes a promising way to investigate experimentally vortex flows in
fluids and superfluids alike.

Many supervised learning algorithms are extensions of GLMs and have link

There are two major drawbacks when using this approach in applications using
real world datasets. One is that none of the link functions available in the
popular packages is a good fit for the data. Second, it is computationally
inefficient and impractical to test all the possible distributions to find the
optimum one. In addition, many GLMs and their machine learning extensions
struggle on problems of overdispersion in Tweedie distributions. In this paper
we propose a quantum extension to GLM that overcomes these drawbacks. A quantum
gate with non-Gaussian transformation can be used to continuously deform the
outcome distribution from known results. In doing so, we eliminate the need for
a link function. Further, by using an algorithm that superposes all possible
distributions to collapse to fit a dataset, we optimize the model in a
computationally efficient way. We provide an initial proof-of-concept by
testing this approach on both a simulation of overdispersed data and then on a
benchmark dataset, which is quite overdispersed, and achieved state of the art

simple tabulation and from SODA'13 on twisted tabulation offered Chernoff-style
concentration bounds on hash based sums, e.g., the number of balls/keys hashing
to a given bin, but under some quite severe restrictions on the expected values
of these sums. The basic idea in tabulation hashing is to view a key as
consisting of $c=O(1)$ characters, e.g., a 64-bit key as $c=8$ characters of
8-bits. The character domain $\Sigma$ should be small enough that character
tables of size $|\Sigma|$ fit in fast cache. The schemes then use $O(1)$ tables
of this size, so the space of tabulation hashing is $O(|\Sigma|)$. However, the
concentration bounds by Patrascu and Thorup only apply if the expected sums are
$\ll |\Sigma|$.
  To see the problem, consider the very simple case where we use tabulation
hashing to throw $n$ balls into $m$ bins and want to analyse the number of
balls in a given bin. With their concentration bounds, we are fine if $n=m$,
for then the expected value is $1$. However, if $m=2$, as when tossing $n$
unbiased coins, the expected value $n/2$ is $\gg |\Sigma|$ for large data sets,
e.g., data sets that do not fit in fast cache.
  To handle expectations that go beyond the limits of our small space, we need
a much more advanced analysis of simple tabulation, plus a new tabulation
technique that we call \emph{tabulation-permutation} hashing which is at most
twice as slow as simple tabulation. No other hashing scheme of comparable speed
offers similar Chernoff-style concentration bounds.

drive engines that autonomously deliver work against a constant mechanical
force or torque. As a generic model for such an engine, we consider systems
that contain one or several active components and a single passive one that is
asymmetric in its geometrical shape or its interactions. Generally, one expects
that such an asymmetry leads to a persistent, directed current in the passive
component, which can be used for the extraction of work. We validate this
expectation for a minimal model consisting of an active and a passive particle
on a one-dimensional lattice. It leads us to identify thermodynamically
consistent measures for the efficiency of the conversion of isotropic activity
to directed work. For systems with continuous degrees of freedom, work cannot
be extracted using a one-dimensional geometry under quite general conditions.
In contrast, we put forward two-dimensional shapes of a movable passive
obstacle that are best suited for the extraction of work, which we compare with
analytical results for an idealised work-extraction mechanism. For a setting
with many noninteracting active particles, we use a mean-field approach to
calculate the power and the efficiency, which we validate by simulations.
Surprisingly, this approach reveals that the interaction with the passive
obstacle can mediate cooperativity between otherwise noninteracting active
particles, which enhances the extracted power per active particle
significantly.

matter and the evolution of member galaxies. To interpret these natural
collider experiments we must account for how much time has passed since
pericenter passage (TSP), the maximum relative speed of the merging
subclusters, merger phase (outbound after first pericenter or returning for
second pericenter), and other dynamical parameters that are not directly
observable. These quantities are often inferred from staged simulations or
analytical timing arguments that include neither substructure, large-scale
structure, nor a cosmologically motivated range of impact parameters. We
include all these effects by extracting dynamical parameters from analog
systems in a cosmological n-body simulation, and we present constraints for 11
observed systems. The TSP and viewing angles we derive are consistent with
those of staged hydrodynamical simulations, but we find lower maximum speeds.
Compared to the analytical MCMAC method we find lower TSP, and viewing angles
that put the separation vector closer to the plane of the sky; we attribute
this to the MCMAC assumption of zero pericenter distance. We discuss potential
extensions to the basic analog method as well as complementarities between
methods.

  We sought to bring in tools and techniques developed for studying ConvNets to
the study of biological neural networks. However, one key difference that
impedes direct translation of tools is that gradients can be obtained from
ConvNets using backpropagation, but such gradients are not available from the

which exam scores can be predicted by a variety of variables that are available
to most faculty and departments. We have found that the results are
surprisingly consistent across the institutions, with the only two variables
that have predictive power being math SAT/ACT scores and concept inventory
pre-scores. The importance of both variables is comparable and fairly similar
across the institutions. They explain 20 - 30 percent of the variation in
students' performance on the final exam. Most notably, the demographic
variables (gender, under-represented minority, first generation to attend
college) are not significant. In all cases, although there appear to be gaps in
exam performance if one considers only the demographic variable, once these two
proxies of incoming preparation are included in the model, there is no longer a
demographic gap. There is only a preparation gap that applies equally across
the entire student population. This work shows that to properly understand
differences in student performance across a diverse population, and hence to
design more effective instruction, it is important to do statistical analyses
that take multiple variables into account. It also illustrates the importance
of having measures that are sensitive to both subject specific and more general
preparation. The results suggest that better matching of the course design and
teaching to the incoming student preparation will likely be the most effective
way to eliminate observed performance gaps across demographic groups while also
improving the success of all students.

important in the detection of ischemia, monitoring perfusion and identifying
disease. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) measures the optical reflectance spectrum
of the tissue and uses this information to quantify its composition, including
StO2. However, real-time monitoring is difficult due to the capture rate and
data processing time. Methods: An endoscopic system based on a multi-fiber
probe was previously developed to sparsely capture HSI data (sHSI). These were
combined with RGB images, via a deep neural network, to generate
high-resolution hypercubes and calculate StO2. To improve accuracy and
processing speed, we propose a dual-input conditional generative adversarial
network (cGAN), Dual2StO2, to directly estimate StO2 by fusing features from
both RGB and sHSI. Results: Validation experiments were carried out on in vivo
porcine bowel data, where the ground truth StO2 was generated from the HSI
camera. The performance was also compared to our previous
super-spectral-resolution network, SSRNet in terms of mean StO2 prediction
accuracy and structural similarity metrics. Dual2StO2 was also tested using
simulated probe data with varying fiber number. Conclusions: StO2 estimation by
Dual2StO2 is visually closer to ground truth in general structure, achieves
higher prediction accuracy and faster processing speed than SSRNet. Simulations
showed that results improved when a greater number of fibers are used in the
probe. Future work will include refinement of the network architecture,
hardware optimization based on simulation results, and evaluation of the
technique in clinical applications beyond StO2 estimation.

a potential violation of the cosmic censorship hypothesis. However, we find
that, analogous to Wald's result for a single charged black hole, such a test
particle which can expose the singularity, would not be able to enter the

the formation and self-gravitational collapse of a DM core containing many DM

black hole that can ignite SN through the emission of Hawking radiation, or
possibly as a by-product of accretion. For annihilating DM, core collapse leads
to an increasing annihilation rate and can ignite SN through a large number of

isostructural to MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, has the lattice parameters of
\textit{a}=4.2445(3)$\AA$ and \textit{c}=40.869(5)$\AA$, respectively. With
increasing Sb content in MnBi$_{2-x}$Sb$_x$Te$_4$, the \textit{a}-lattice
decreases linearly following the Vegards law while the \textit{c}-lattice shows
little compositional dependence. The \textit{a}-lattice contraction occurs by
reducing Mn-Te-Mn bond angle while Mn-Te bond length remains nearly constant.
The anisotropic magnetic properties suggest an antiferromagnetic order below
T$_N$=19\,K for MnSb$_2$Te$_4$ with the magnetic moments aligned along the
crystallographic \textit{c}-axis. The antiferromagnetic ordering temperature
slightly decreases from 24\,K for MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ to 19\,K for MnSb$_2$Te$_4$.
More dramatic change was observed for the critical magnetic fields required for
the spin-flop transition and moment saturation. With increasing Sb content,
both critical fields decrease and in MnSb$_2$Te$_4$ a small field of 3\,kOe is
enough to saturate the moment. In high magnetic fields, the saturation moment
shows significant suppression from 3.56$\mu_B$/Mn for MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ to
1.57$\mu_B$/Mn for MnSb$_2$Te$_4$. Data analyses suggest that both the
interlayer magnetic interaction and single ion anisotropy decrease with
increasing Sb content. The partial substitution of Bi by Sb also dramatically
affects the transport properties. A crossover from n-type to p-type conducting
behavior is observed around x=0.63. Our results show close correlation between
structural, magnetic and transport properties in MnBi$_{2-x}$Sb$_x$Te$_4$ and
that partial substitution of Bi by Sb is an effective approach to fine tuning
both the magnetism and transport properties of MnBi$_{2-x}$Sb$_x$Te$_4$.

on the internal structure and composition of the stars is encoded in their
tidal Love numbers, which leave an imprint in the waveform of the GW signal
emitted from the binary during the late inspiral phase. We extended the theory
of tidal deformations of compact objects by computing the spin-tidal
corrections that affect the dynamics and the GW emission of a binary system at
the leading post-Newtonian (PN) order and to linear order in the spin. These
corrections are divided into two classes: terms due to the coupling between the
standard tidal Love numbers and the spins of the objects, and terms depending
on the rotational tidal Love numbers. Both enter the GW phase at 6.5PN order.
We analysed the impact of the spin-tidal couplings by estimating the parameter
bias induced on GW170817-like events, assuming second- and third-generation
ground based interferometers. If relatively high spinning ($\chi \gtrsim 0.1$)
NS binaries exist in nature, these effects might be observed by the next
generation of detectors. Lastly, we proved the feasibility of solving the

that few observations of coalescing binary NS by a network of advanced

is not yet fully understood, and the processes related to the early
fragmentation and collapse are largely unexplored today. The high-mass star
forming region G9.62+0.19 is a well known source, presenting several cores at
different evolutionary stages. Aims. We determine the magnetic field morphology
and strength in the high-mass star forming region G9.62+0.19, to investigate
its relation to the evolutionary sequence of the cores. Methods. We use Band 7
ALMA observations in full polarisation mode and we analyse the polarised dust
emission. We estimate the magnetic field strength via the
Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi and the Structure Function methods. Results. We
resolve several protostellar cores embedded in a bright and dusty filamentary
structure. The polarised emission is clearly detected in six regions. Moreover
the magnetic field is oriented along the filament and appears perpendicular to
the direction of the outflows. We suggest an evolutionary sequence of the
magnetic field, and the less evolved hot core exhibits a magnetic field
stronger than the more evolved one. We detect linear polarisation from thermal
line emission and we tentatively compared linear polarisation vectors from our
observations with previous linearly polarised OH masers observations. We also
compute the spectral index, the column density and the mass for some of the
cores. Conclusions. The high magnetic field strength and the smooth polarised
emission indicate that the magnetic field could play an important role for the
fragmentation and the collapse process in the star forming region G9.62+019 and
that the evolution of the cores can be magnetically regulated. On average, the
magnetic field derived by the linear polarised emission from dust, thermal
lines and masers is pointing in the same direction and has consistent strength.

many time series data mining applications. However, SAX only reflects the
segment mean value feature and misses important information in a segment,
namely the trend of the value change in the segment. Such a miss may cause a
wrong classification in some cases, since the SAX representation cannot
distinguish different time series with similar average values but different
trends. In this paper, we present Trend Feature Symbolic Aggregate
approximation (TFSAX) to solve this problem. First, we utilize Piecewise
Aggregate Approximation (PAA) approach to reduce dimensionality and discretize
the mean value of each segment by SAX. Second, extract trend feature in each
segment by using trend distance factor and trend shape factor. Then, design
multi-resolution symbolic mapping rules to discretize trend information into
symbols. We also propose a modified distance measure by integrating the SAX
distance with a weighted trend distance. We show that our distance measure has
a tighter lower bound to the Euclidean distance than that of the original SAX.
The experimental results on diverse time series data sets demonstrate that our
proposed representation significantly outperforms the original SAX
representation and an improved SAX representation for classification.

binary mergers via Lidov-Kozai oscillations induced by tertiary companions in

explore a wide range of binary/triple parameters that lead to binary mergers,
and determine the distributions of eccentricity ($e_\mathrm{m}$) and spin-orbit
misalignment angle ($\theta_\rm {sl}^\rm f$) when the binary enters the
LIGO/VIRGO band. We use the double-averaged (over both orbits) and
single-averaged (over the inner orbit) secular equations, as well as N-body
integration, to evolve systems with different hierarchy levels, including the
leading-order post-Newtonian effect, spin-orbit coupling and gravitational
radiation. We find that for merging BH-BH binaries with comparable masses,
about $7\%$ have $e_\mathrm{m}>0.1$ and $0.7\%$ have $e_{\rm m}>0.9$. The
majority of the mergers have significant eccentricities in the LISA band. The
BH spin evolution and $\theta_\rm {sl}^\rm f$ are correlated with the orbital
evolution and $e_{\rm m}$. Mergers with $e_{\rm m} \lesssim 10^{-3}$ have a
distribution of $\theta_\rm {sl}^\rm f$ that peaks around $90^\circ$ (and thus
favoring a projected binary spin parameter $\chi_{\rm eff}\sim 0$), while
mergers with larger $e_{\rm m}$ have a more isotropic spin-orbit misalignments.
For typical BH-NS binaries, strong octuple effects lead to more mergers with
non-negligible $e_\mathrm{m}$ (with $\sim 18\%$ having $e_\mathrm{m}>0.1$ and
$2.5\%$ having $e_\mathrm{m}>0.9$), and the final BH spin axis tends to be
randomly orientated. Measurements or constraints on eccentric mergers and
$\theta_\rm {sl}^\rm f$ from LIGO/VIRGO and LISA would provide useful
diagnostics on the dynamical formation of merging BH or NS binaries in triples.

between the [CII] emission and the star formation rate, either as

seems to be independent of metallicity, but the very large scatter does not

study, we investigate the metallicity evolution of the correlation via a
high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulation of a dwarf galaxy employing
state-of-the-art sub-grid modelling for gas cooling, star formation, and
stellar feedback, and that self-consistently evolves the abundances of metal

evolve with metallicity, in agreement with theoretical predictions, but also
that this evolution can be hardly detected in observations, because of the

electron scattering optical depth. We find that three different effects
contribute to differentiate warm and cold dark matter (CDM) predictions: WDM
suppresses the number of haloes with mass less than few $10^9$ M$_{\odot}$; at
a fixed halo mass, WDM produces fewer stars than CDM; and finally at halo
masses below $10^9$ M$_{\odot}$, WDM has a larger fraction of dark haloes than
CDM post-reionization. These three effects combine to produce a lower stellar
mass function in WDM for galaxies with stellar masses at and below $\sim 10^7$

factor of two in the WDM scenario, and for a fixed escape fraction, the

unified treatment of all quasi-primary operators irrespective of their Lorentz
group irreducible representations. This unified treatment works at the level of
the operator product expansion and hence applies to all correlation functions.
A very useful differential operator appearing in the operator product expansion
is established and its action on appropriate products of embedding space
coordinates is explicitly computed. This computation leads to tensorial
generalizations of the usual Exton function for all correlation functions.
Several important identities and contiguous relations are also demonstrated for
these new tensorial functions. From the operator product expansion all
correlation functions for all quasi-primary operators, irrespective of their
Lorentz group irreducible representations, can be computed recursively in a
systematic way. The resulting answer can be expressed in terms of tensor
structures that carry all the Lorentz group information and linear combinations
of the new tensorial functions. Finally, a summary of the well-defined rules

topological orders. In this context, an anomalous topological order is one that
cannot be realized in a strictly $(2+1)$-D system but can be realized on the
surface of a $(3+1)$-D symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase. To detect
these anomalies we propose several anomaly indicators --- functions that take
as input the algebraic data of a symmetric topological order and that output a
number indicating the presence or absence of an anomaly. We construct such
indicators for both structures of the full symmetry group, i.e.
$U(1)\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ and $U(1)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, and for both
bosonic and fermionic topological orders. In all cases we conjecture that our
indicators are complete in the sense that the anomalies they detect are in
one-to-one correspondence with the known classification of $(3+1)$-D SPT phases
with the same symmetry. We also show that one of our indicators for bosonic
topological orders has a mathematical interpretation as a partition function

massive neutrinos on cosmological scales. Because they are freely streaming,
neutrinos can penetrate the interior of voids more easily than cold dark matter
or baryons, which makes their relative contribution to the mass budget in voids
much higher than elsewhere in the Universe. In simulations it has recently been
shown how various characteristics of voids in the matter distribution are
affected by neutrinos, such as their abundance, density profiles, dynamics, and
clustering properties. However, the tracers used to identify voids in
observations (e.g., galaxies or halos) are affected by neutrinos as well, and
isolating the unique neutrino signatures inherent to voids becomes more
difficult. In this paper we make use of the DEMNUni suite of simulations to
investigate the clustering bias of voids in Fourier space as a function of
their core density and compensation. We find a clear dependence on the sum of
neutrino masses that remains significant even for void statistics extracted
from halos. In particular, we observe that the amplitude of the linear void
bias increases with neutrino mass for voids defined in dark matter, whereas
this trend gets reversed and slightly attenuated when measuring the relative
void-halo bias using voids identified in the halo distribution. Finally, we
argue how the original behaviour can be restored when considering observations
of the total matter distribution (e.g. via weak lensing), and comment on
scale-dependent effects in the void bias that may provide additional
information on neutrinos in the future.

ionizing photons required for cosmic reionization, one expects the first
ionized bubbles to be centered on overdensities of such galaxies. Here, we
model the properties of galaxy populations within isolated, ionized bubbles
that SKA-1 should be able to resolve at z=7-10, and explore the prospects for
galaxy counts within such structures with various upcoming near-infrared
telescopes. We find that, for the bubbles that are within reach of SKA-1
tomography, the bubble volume is closely tied to the number of ionizing photons
that have escaped from the galaxies within. In the case of galaxy-dominated
reionization, galaxies are expected to turn up above the spectroscopic
detection threshold of JWST and ELT in even the smallest resolvable bubbles at
redshifts z=10 or below. The prospects of detecting galaxies within these
structures in purely photometric surveys with Euclid, WFIRST, JWST or ELT are
also discussed. While spectroscopy is preferable towards the end of
reionization to provide a robust sample of bubble members, multiband imaging
may be a competitive option for bubbles at z~10, due to the very small number
of line-of-sight interlopers expected at similar redshifts.

Our approach is universal as it can successfully attack different neural

against 2 vanilla DNNs and 13 defended ones, it outperforms state-of-the-art
black-box or white-box attack methods for most test cases. Additionally, our
results reveal that adversarial training remains one of the best defense
techniques, and the adversarial examples are not as transferable across
defended DNNs as them across vanilla DNNs.

statistical draw towards large soft SUSY breaking terms tempered by the
requirement of proper electroweak symmetry breaking where SUSY contributions to
the weak scale are not too far from m(weak)~ 100 GeV. Such a picture leads to
the prediction that m_h~ 125 GeV while most sparticles are beyond current LHC
reach. Here we explore the possibility that the magnitude of the Peccei-Quinn
(PQ) scale f_a is also set by string landscape considerations within the
framework of a compelling SUSY axion model. First, we examine the case where
the PQ symmetry arises as an accidental approximate global symmetry from a more
fundamental gravity-safe Z(24)^R symmetry and where the SUSY mu parameter
arises from a Kim-Nilles operator. The pull towards large soft terms then also
pulls the PQ scale as large as possible. Unless this is tempered by rather
severe (unknown) cosmological or anthropic bounds on the density of dark
matter, then we would expect a far greater abundance of dark matter than is
observed. This conclusion cannot be negated by adopting a tiny axion
misalignment angle theta_i because WIMPs are also overproduced at large f_a.
Hence, we conclude that setting the PQ scale via anthropics is highly unlikely.
Instead, requiring soft SUSY breaking terms of order the gravity-mediation
scale m_{3/2}~ 10-100 TeV places the mixed axion-neutralino dark matter
abundance into the intermediate scale sweet zone where f_a~ 10^{11}-10^{12}
GeV. We compare our analysis to the more general case of a generic SUSY DFSZ
axion model with uniform selection on theta_i but leading to the measured dark
matter abundance: this approach leads to a preference for f_a~ 10^{12} GeV.

that the amplitudes of the first ~20 echoes decay inversely with time, while

asymmetric or biased noise channels is known to be much higher than with qubits
without such structured noise. However, it is unclear how much this improvement
persists when realistic circuit level noise is taken into account. This is
because implementations of gates which do not commute with the dominant error
un-bias the noise channel. In particular, a native bias-preserving
controlled-NOT (CX) gate, which is an essential ingredient of stabilizer codes,
is not possible in strictly two-level systems. Here we overcome the challenge
of implementing a bias-preserving CX gate by using stabilized cat qubits in
driven nonlinear oscillators. The physical noise channel of this qubit is
biased towards phase-flips, which increase linearly with the size of the cat,
while bit-flips are exponentially suppressed with cat size. Remarkably, the
error channel of this native CX gate between two such cat qubits is also
dominated by phase-flips, while bit-flips remain exponentially suppressed. This
CX gate relies on the topological phase that arises from the rotation of the
cat qubit in phase space. The availability of bias-preserving CX gates opens a
path towards fault-tolerant codes tailored to biased-noise cat qubits with high
threshold and low overhead. As an example, we analyze a scheme for concatenated
error correction using cat qubits. We find that the availability of CX gates
with moderately sized cat qubits, having mean photon number <10, improves a
rigorous lower bound on the fault-tolerance threshold by a factor of two and
decreases the overhead in logical Clifford operations by a factor of 5. We
expect these estimates to improve significantly with further optimization and
with direct use of other codes such as topological codes tailored to biased
noise.

neutron diffraction reveals increased scattering near the structural Bragg
peaks having a wider Q-dependence along the c-axis than the nuclear Bragg

which is thermodynamically determined by the energetics of interatomic forces
between its amino acid building blocks (the order of amino acids, known as the
sequence, defines a protein). Given the costs (time, money, human resources) of
determining protein structures via experimental means such as X-ray
crystallography, can we better describe and compare protein 3D structures in a
robust and efficient manner, so as to gain meaningful biological insights? We
begin by considering a relatively simple problem, limiting ourselves to just
protein secondary structural elements. Historically, many computational methods
have been devised to classify amino acid residues in a protein chain into one
of several discrete secondary structures, of which the most well-characterized
are the geometrically regular $\alpha$-helix and $\beta$-sheet; irregular
structural patterns, such as 'turns' and 'loops', are less understood. Here, we
present a study of Deep Learning techniques to classify the loop-like end cap
structures which delimit $\alpha$-helices. Previous work used highly empirical
and heuristic methods to manually classify helix capping motifs. Instead, we
use structural data directly--including (i) backbone torsion angles computed
from 3D structures, (ii) macromolecular feature sets (e.g., physicochemical
properties), and (iii) helix cap classification data (from CAPS-DB)--as the
ground truth to train a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model to
classify helix cap residues. We tried different network architectures and
scanned hyperparameters in order to train and assess several models; we also
trained a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to use as a baseline. Ultimately, we
achieved 85% class-balanced accuracy with a deep BiLSTM model.

grapevine breeding and viticulture. The number of harvested berries per plant
is strongly correlated with the resulting quality. Therefore, early yield
forecasting can enable a focused thinning of berries to ensure a high quality
end product. Traditionally yield estimation is done by extrapolating from a
small sample size and by utilizing historic data. Moreover, it needs to be
carried out by skilled experts with much experience in this field. Berry
detection in images offers a cheap, fast and non-invasive alternative to the
otherwise time-consuming and subjective on-site analysis by experts. We apply
fully convolutional neural networks on images acquired with the Phenoliner, a
field phenotyping platform. We count single berries in images to avoid the
error-prone detection of grapevine clusters. Clusters are often overlapping and
can vary a lot in the size which makes the reliable detection of them
difficult. We address especially the detection of white grapes directly in the
vineyard. The detection of single berries is formulated as a classification
task with three classes, namely 'berry', 'edge' and 'background'. A connected
component algorithm is applied to determine the number of berries in one image.
We compare the automatically counted number of berries with the manually
detected berries in 60 images showing Riesling plants in vertical shoot
positioned trellis (VSP) and semi minimal pruned hedges (SMPH). We are able to
detect berries correctly within the VSP system with an accuracy of 94.0 \% and
for the SMPH system with 85.6 \%.

discovered several weakly ordered states and a tendency of close competition

general, we find that seemingly unrelated magnetic orders are intertwined with
each other and that the conventional spin orders seen in the experiments are
accompanied by more exotic hidden orders. Our critical theories are categorized
into $z=1$ and $z=2$ types, based on their spinon dispersion and Hamiltonian
diagonalizability, and are shown to give distinct signatures in the heat

progenitors indicate a possible threshold around $M_{\rm ZAMS}\sim 16-20$
M$_\odot$, where red supergiants with larger birth masses do not appear to
result in supernova explosions and instead implode directly into a black hole.
In this study we argue that it is not a coincidence that this threshold closely
matches the critical transition of central Carbon burning in massive stars from
the convective to radiative regime. In lighter stars, Carbon burns convectively
in the center and result in compact final presupernova cores that are likely to
result in explosions, while in heavier stars after the transition, it burns as
a radiative flame and the stellar cores become significantly harder to explode.
Using the KEPLER code we demonstrate the sensitivity of this transition to the
rate of $^{12}$C$(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$O reaction and the overshoot mixing
efficiency, and we argue that the upper mass limit of exploding red supergiants
could be employed to constrain uncertain input physics of massive stellar
evolution calculations. The initial mass corresponding to the central Carbon
burning transition range from 14 to 26 M$_\odot$ in recently published models
from various groups and codes, and only a few are in agreement with the
estimates inferred from direct imaging studies.

conformally invariant bending energies. The simplest example is the M\""obius
invariant conformal arc-length on planar curves, dependent on the Frenet
curvature $\kappa$ through its first derivative with respect to arc-length.
There are four conserved currents associated with this invariance: the tension
and torque associated with Euclidean invariance, as well as scalar and vector
currents reflecting invariance under scaling and special conformal
transformations respectively. If the tension vanishes, all equilibrium states
are self-similar: in the case of conformal arc-length, these are logarithmic
spirals with no internal structure. More generally, the tension-free states are
logarithmic spirals decorated with a repeating self-similar internal structure.
Here it will be shown how the conservation laws can be used to construct these
curves, while also endowing their geometry with a mechanical interpretation.
The scaling current and the torque together provide a scale-invariant ode for
the dimensionless variable $\kappa'/\kappa^2$, which captures the internal
structure of the spiral. For conformal arc-length it is constant. In
tension-free states, the special conformal current vanishes. Its projections
along orthogonal directions determine directly the distance from the spiral
apex locally in terms of the curvature. The quadratic Casimir invariant of the
M\""obius group can be cast in terms of the four currents, none of which itself
is invariant. For conformal arc-length, this is identified as the conformal
curvature (the Schwarzian derivative of the Frenet curvature); it is constant
along equilibrium curves.

monitoring in driving scenarios has mostly been carried out using vision

It is only recently that bio-sensing modalities such as Electroencephalogram

explored sufficiently yet in this paradigm. This is the detection of specific
events, hazardous and non-hazardous, during driving that affects the driver's
mental and physiological states. The other challenge in evaluating multi-modal
sensory applications is the absence of very large scale EEG data because of the
various limitations of using EEG in the real world. In this paper, we use both

driving events. We collect user data on twelve subjects and show how in the
absence of very large-scale datasets, we can still use pre-trained deep

themselves mostly NP-complete and thus not easily applicable to large networks.
On the other hand, subset selection problems occur in slightly different
context in machine learning (ML) where the goal is to select a subset of high

novel DPP-based learning (DPPL) framework for efficiently solving subset

traditional optimization algorithms for subset selection by learning the
quality-diversity trade-off in the optimal subsets selected by an optimization

natural intelligence. While overcomplete Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), in
theory, have the capacity to represent long-term temporal structure, they often
fail to learn and converge to local minima. We show that by constraining HMMs
with a simple sparsity structure inspired by biology, we can make it learn
variable order sequences efficiently. We call this model cloned HMM (CHMM)
because the sparsity structure enforces that many hidden states map
deterministically to the same emission state. CHMMs with over 1 billion
parameters can be efficiently trained on GPUs without being severely affected
by the credit diffusion problem of standard HMMs. Unlike n-grams and sequence
memoizers, CHMMs can model temporal dependencies at arbitrarily long distances
and recognize contexts with 'holes' in them. Compared to Recurrent Neural
Networks and their Long Short-Term Memory extensions (LSTMs), CHMMs are
generative models that can natively deal with uncertainty. Moreover, CHMMs
return a higher-order graph that represents the temporal structure of the data
which can be useful for community detection, and for building hierarchical
models. Our experiments show that CHMMs can beat n-grams, sequence memoizers,
and LSTMs on character-level language modeling tasks. CHMMs can be a viable
alternative to these methods in some tasks that require variable order sequence
modeling and the handling of uncertainty.

the atomic transition dipoles are coupled to the free radiation field. When the
atoms are separated by distances smaller or comparable to the wavelength of the
transition, the exchange of virtual photons leads to the transport of the
excitation through the lattice. Even though this is a strongly dissipative
system, we find that the transport is subradiant, that is, the excitation
lifetime is orders of magnitude longer than the one of an individual atom. In
particular, we show that a subspace of the spectrum is formed by subradiant
states with a linear dispersion relation, which allows for the dispersionless
transport of wave packets over long distances with virtually zero decay rate.
Moreover, the group velocity and direction of the transport can be controlled
via an external uniform magnetic field while preserving its subradiant
character. The simplicity and versatility of this system, together with the
robustness of subradiance against disorder, makes it relevant for a range of
applications such as lossless energy transport and long-time light storage.

models is limited by computational expense. Intense TCs are rare and have
small-scale structures, making it difficult to produce large ensembles of
storms at high resolution. Further, models often fail to capture the process of
rapid intensification, which is a distinguishing feature of many intense TCs.
Understanding rapid intensification is especially important in the context of
global warming, which may increase the frequency of intense TCs. To better
leverage computational resources for the study of rapid intensification, we
introduce an action minimization algorithm applied to the WRF and WRFPLUS
models. Action minimization nudges the model into forming more intense TCs than
it otherwise would; it does so via the maximum likelihood path in a stochastic
formulation of the model, thereby allowing targeted study of intensification
mechanisms.
  We apply action minimization to simulations of Hurricanes Danny (2015) and
Fred (2009) at 6 km resolution to demonstrate that the algorithm consistently
intensifies TCs via physically plausible pathways. We show an approximately
ten-fold computational savings using action minimization to study the tail of
the TC intensification distribution. Further, for Hurricanes Danny and Fred,
action minimization produces perturbations that preferentially reduce low-level
shear as compared to upper-level shear, at least above a threshold of
approximately $4 \mathrm{\ m \ s^{-1}}$. We also demonstrate that asymmetric,
time-dependent patterns of heating can cause significant TC intensification
beyond symmetric, azimuthally-averaged heating and find a regime of non-linear
response to asymmetric heating that has not been extensively studied in
previous work.

communication between them often relies on a set of pre-specified symbols for a
given domain. In this paper, we investigate the automatic construction of these
symbols from abstractions to form ""natural languages"" for such agents. The
focus of this initial investigation is on a task planning setting where one
agent (the speaker) directly communicates a ""plan sketch"" to another agent (the
listener) to achieve coordination. In contrast to prior work, we view language
formation as a fundamental requirement for resolving miscoordination. This view
enables us to ""compute"" a language from the ground up by mapping physical
states to symbols, thus reverse engineering the function of languages.
Languages that arise from this process are only approximately expressive of the
actual plans, meaning that they specify abstractions over the plan space, which
is not only theoretically appealing as it provides the desired flexibility to
the listener to choose its plan during execution, but also practically useful
since it both reduces the communication cost of the speaker and computational
cost of the listener. We formulate this language construction problem and show
that it is NEXP-complete. An approximate solution is then developed to relate
this problem to task planning problems that have efficient off-the-shelf
solutions. Finally, we discuss a multi-agent path-finding domain in our
evaluation to provide a comprehensive set of results to illustrate the benefits

0.1%. In the training phase of the proposed method, the model learns the
suitable beam orientations based on the anatomical features of patients and
omits time intensive calculations of dose influence matrices for all possible

is vital for downstream tasks like tracking, motion planning and motion
prediction. Moreover, annotations for all camera images are automatically
obtained by projecting annotations from 3D space into the image domain. In
addition to the raw image and point cloud feeds, a Masterview consisting of the
top view (bird's-eye-view), side view and front views is made available to
observe objects of interest from different perspectives. Comparisons of our

RRPN, a Radar-based real-time region proposal algorithm for object detection in

detections to the image coordinate system and generating pre-defined anchor
boxes for each mapped Radar detection point. These anchor boxes are then
transformed and scaled based on the object's distance from the vehicle, to
provide more accurate proposals for the detected objects. We evaluate our
method on the newly released NuScenes dataset [1] using the Fast R-CNN object

optimizing the highly non-convex kmeans problem. Its defining feature is that
its crossover step involves all the members of the current generation,
stochastically recombining them with a repurposed variant of the $k$-means++
seeding algorithm. The recombination also uses a reweighting mechanism that
realizes a progressively sharper stochastic selection policy and ensures that
the population eventually coalesces into a single solution. We compare this
scheme with state-of-the-art alternative, a more standard genetic algorithm
with deterministic pairwise-nearest-neighbor crossover and an elitist selection
policy, of which we also provide an augmented and efficient implementation.
Extensive tests on large and challenging datasets (both synthetic and
real-word) show that for fixed population sizes recombinator-$k$-means is
generally superior in terms of the optimization objective, at the cost of a
more expensive crossover step. When adjusting the population sizes of the two
algorithms to match their running times, we find that for short times the
(augmented) pairwise-nearest-neighbor method is always superior, while at
longer times recombinator-$k$-means will match it and, on the most difficult
examples, take over. We conclude that the reweighted whole-population
recombination is more costly, but generally better at escaping local minima.
Moreover, it is algorithmically simpler and more general (it could be applied
even to $k$-medians or $k$-medoids, for example). Our implementations are

terminal set $T\subset V$ is a subgraph $G'$ that connects the terminal
vertices while satisfying a given set of constraints. Examples include Steiner
trees (preserving connectivity among $T$) and subsetwise spanners (preserving
shortest path distances up to a stretch factor). Multi-level constrained
terminal sketches are generalizations in which terminal vertices require
different levels or grades of service and each terminal pair is connected with
edges of at least the minimum required level of the two terminals.
  This paper gives a flexible procedure for computing a broad class of
multi-level graph sketches, which encompasses multi-level graph spanners,
Steiner trees, and $k$--connected subgraphs as a few special cases. The
proposed procedure is modular, i.e., it relies on availability of a
single-level solver module (be it an oracle or approximation algorithm). One
key result is that an $\ell$--level constrained terminal sketch can be computed
with $\log\ell$ queries of the solver module while producing feasible solutions
with approximation guarantees independent of $\ell$.
  Additionally, a new polynomial time algorithm for computing a subsetwise
spanner is proposed. We show that for $k\in\N$, $\eps>0$, and $T\subset V$,
there is a subsetwise $(2k-1)(1+\eps)$--spanner with total weight
$O(|T|^\frac1kW(\ST(G,T)))$, where $W(\ST(G,T))$ is the weight of the Steiner
tree of $G$ over the subset $T$. This is the first algorithm and weight
guarantee for a multiplicative subsetwise spanner for nonplanar graphs.
Numerical experiments are also done to illustrate the performance of the
proposed algorithms.

enumerating them in a brute-force way. The algorithm has proven to be efficient
for calculating \ce{O} $K$ edges of transition metal oxides, which converge at
the second excitation order (denoted as $f^{(n)}$ with $n = 2$), i.e., the
final-state configurations with two \emph{e-h} pairs (with one hole being the

converge for general cases and at which excitation order $n$ one should stop

many-electron configurations still grows exponentially with the excitation
order $n$. In this work, we prove two theorems that can indicate the order of
magnitude of the contribution of the $f^{(n)}$ configurations, so that one can
estimate their contribution very quickly without actually calculating their

demonstrate that with an increasing power allocation factor, the outage

observations confirm that the late phase emission originates from a set of
longer or higher loops than the main flare loops. Nevertheless, some questions
remain controversial: What is the relationship between these two loop systems?
What is the heating source of late phase emission, a heating accompany the main
phase heating or occuring quite later? In this paper, we present clear evidence
for heating source in a late-phase solar flare: magnetic reconnection of
overlying field in a quadrupolar magnetic configuration. The event is triggered
by an erupted core structure that eventually leads to a coronal mass ejection
(CME). Cusp feature and its shrinkage motion high in the late-phase emission
region are the manifestation of the later phase reconnection following the main
flare reconnection. Using the enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops (EBTEL)

of minimizing the load on the enzymes through sequestration, whilst maintaining
at least a minimum reaction flux. In particular, we ask: which binding free
energies of the enzyme-substrate and enzyme-product reaction intermediates
minimize the fraction of enzymes sequestered in complexes, while sustaining at
a certain minimal flux? Under reasonable biophysical assumptions, we find that
the optimal design will saturate the bound on the minimal flux, and reflects a
basic trade-off in catalytic operation. If both binding free energies are too
high, there is low sequestration, but the effective progress of the reaction is
hampered. If both binding free energies are too low, there is high
sequestration, and the reaction flux may also be suppressed in extreme cases.
The optimal binding free energies are therefore neither too high nor too low,
but in fact moderate. Moreover, the optimal difference in substrate and product
binding free energies, which contributes to the thermodynamic driving force of
the reaction, is in general strongly constrained by the intrinsic free-energy
difference between products and reactants. Both the strategies of using a
negative binding free-energy difference to drive the catalyst-bound reaction
forward, and of using a positive binding free-energy difference to enhance
detachment of the product, are limited in their efficacy.

identify the most influential fact for a predicted link and evaluate the
sensitivity of the model to the addition of fake facts. We introduce an
efficient approach to estimate the effect of such modifications by
approximating the change in the embeddings when the knowledge graph changes. To
avoid the combinatorial search over all possible facts, we train a network to
decode embeddings to their corresponding graph components, allowing the use of
gradient-based optimization to identify the adversarial modification. We use
these techniques to evaluate the robustness of link prediction models (by
measuring sensitivity to additional facts), study interpretability through the
facts most responsible for predictions (by identifying the most influential
neighbors), and detect incorrect facts in the knowledge base.

close to best possible, since the optimal number of colors is $\kappa(G)+1$.
  On the other hand, we establish certain lower bounds indicating that
sublinear algorithms probably cannot go much further. In particular, we prove
that any randomized coloring algorithm that uses $\kappa(G)+1$ many colors,
would require $\Omega(n^2)$ storage in the one pass streaming model, and
$\Omega(n^2)$ many queries in the general graph query model, where $n$ is the
number of vertices in the graph. These lower bounds hold even when the value of
$\kappa(G)$ is known in advance; at the same time, our upper bounds do not
require $\kappa(G)$ to be given in advance.

we propose a coordination and trajectory prediction system (CTPS), which has a
hierarchical structure including a macro-level coordination recognition module

Within the framework of new physics beyond the Standard Model, these

investigated the potential of the future $\mu p$ colliders on the top quark
flavor changing neutral current interactions through the subprocesses $\gamma q

produced through the main reaction $\mu p \rightarrow \mu \gamma p \rightarrow
\mu W b X $ at the LHC$-\mu p$, the FCC$-\mu p$ and the SPPC-$\mu p$. For the
main reaction, the total cross sections have been calculated as a function of
the anomalous $ tq\gamma $ couplings. In addition, sensitivities on BR($t

obtain that the best constraints on BR($t \rightarrow q \gamma$) are at the
order of 10$^{-7}$ which is four orders of magnitude better than the LHC's

Electromagnetically induced transparency is perhaps the best known example,

produce stored light where a light field is mapped completely into a coherence
of the atomic ensemble. In contrast to stored light, in which the optical field
is extinguished, stationary light is a bright field of light with a group

important to maintain an optical field, such as attempts to engineer large

antiferromagnetic honeycomb lattices compounds, A4B2O9 (A = Co, Fe, Mn; B = Nb,
Ta), have been explored owing to the occurrence of linear magnetoelectricity.
We observe a highly nonlinear magnetoelectric effect on single crystals of
Co4Ta2O9 (CTO), distinctive from the linear behavior in the isostructural
Co4Nb2O9. Ferroelectricity emerges primarily along the [110] direction under
magnetic fields, with the onset of antiferromagnetic order at TN = 20.5 K. For
in-plane magnetic field, a spin-flop occurs at HC ~ 0.3 T, above which the
ferroelectric polarization gradually becomes negative and reaches a broad
minimum. Upon increasing magnetic field further, the polarization crosses zero
and increases continuously to ~60 uC/m2 at 9 T. In contrast, the polarization
for a magnetic field perpendicular to the hexagonal plane increases
monotonously and reaches ~80 uC/m2 at 9 T. This observation of a strongly
nonlinear magnetoelectricity suggests that two types of inequivalent Co2+
sublattices generate magnetic field-dependent ferroelectric polarization with
opposite signs. These results motivate fundamental and applied research on the
intriguing magnetoelectric characteristics of these honeycomb lattice

activated by the long-range order of Er3+ moments below TEr = 10 K in addition
to the ferromagnetic order of Co2+ and Mn4+ moments arising at TC = 67 K,
characterized by compensated magnetization at TComp = 3.15 K. The inverted

simultaneously the structural and oscillatory evolution of models with varying

Leveraging tools from stochastic geometry, this paper attempts to fill this

Using a Boolean model to statistically characterize the random locations,
orientations, and sizes of reflectors, and assuming first-order (i.e.,
single-bounce) reflections, the distance traversed by the first-arriving NLOS
path is characterized. Under these assumptions, this analysis reveals that NLOS
bias exhibits an exponential form and can in fact be well approximated by an
exponential distribution -- a result consistent with previous NLOS bias error
models in the literature. This analytically derived distribution is then
compared to a common exponential model from the literature, revealing this
distribution to be a close match in some cases and a lower bound in others.
Lastly, the assumptions under which these results were derived suggest this
model is aptly suited to characterize NLOS bias in 5G millimeter wave systems

subject to the accurate numerical modelling of complex wave propagation
phenomena. Over the last decades, high-order numerical approximation for
partial differential equations has become a well-established tool. Here we
propose and study numerically the implicit approximation in time of wave
equations by a Galerkin--collocation approach that relies on a higher order
space-time finite element approach. The conceptual basis is the establishment
of a direct connection between the Galerkin method for the time discretization
and the classical collocation methods, with the perspective of achieving the
accuracy of the former with reduced computational costs provided by the latter
in terms of less complex linear algebraic systems. For the fully discrete
solution, higher order regularity in time is further ensured which can be
advantageous in the discretization of multi-physics systems. The accuracy and
efficiency of the variational collocation approach is carefully studied by
numerical experiments.

efficient strategy to deal with this problem is to employ resampling techniques
before training the classifier. Existing multilabel sampling methods alleviate
the (global) imbalance of multi-label datasets. However, performance
degradation is mainly due to rare subconcepts and overlapping of classes that
could be analysed by looking at the local characteristics of the minority
examples, rather than the imbalance of the whole dataset. We propose a new
method for synthetic oversampling of multi-label data that focuses on local
label distribution to generate more diverse and better labeled instances.
Experimental results on 13 multi-label datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach in a variety of evaluation measures, particularly in
the case of an ensemble of classifiers trained on repeated samples of the

paths of future technologies using intricate directed graphs. Specifically,
there are two classes of alternative techniques that we consider: scenario

reconsider the relationship between vocoder features extracted using the high

the conversion phase, the latent codes and the converted features in VAE based
VC are in fact source F0 dependent. To this end, we propose to utilize the F0

latent code from the F0 and thus generates converted F0 dependent converted
features. Second, to better capture temporal dependencies of the spectral
features and the F0 pattern, we replace the frame wise conversion structure in
the original VAE based VC framework with a fully convolutional network
structure. Our experiments demonstrate that the degree of disentanglement as

moderate resolution optical and NIR spectra covering the redshifted CIV and
H$\beta$ over a broad range of luminosity log L ~ 44 - 48.5 [erg/s] and
redshift (0 - 3), following an approach based on the quasar main sequence. The
present analysis indicates that the line width of CIV 1549 is not immediately
offering a virial broadening estimator equivalent to H$\beta$. At the same time
a virialized part of the BLR appears to be preserved even at the highest
luminosities. We suggest a correction to FWHM(CIV) for Eddington ratio (using
the CIV blueshift as a proxy) and luminosity effects that can be applied over
more than four dex in luminosity. Great care should be used in estimating
high-L black hole masses from CIV 1549 line width. However, once corrected

which has flat bands with nontrivial topology. Here, we give a detailed
calculation about its band structures and the band topology, i.e. valley Chern
number of the nearly flat bands, with the continuum model. With realistic
parameters, the magic angle of twisted TLG is about 1.12$^{\circ}$, at which
two nearly flat bands appears. Unlike the twisted bilayer graphene, a small
twist angle can induce a tiny gap at all the Dirac points, which can be
enlarged further by a perpendicular electric field. The valley Chern numbers of
the two nearly flat bands in the twisted TLG depends on the twist angle
$\theta$ and the perpendicular electric field $E_\perp$. Considering its
topological flat bands, the twisted TLG should be an ideal experimental
platform to study the strongly correlated physics in topologically nontrivial
flat band systems. And, due to its reduced symmetry, the correlated states in
twisted TLG should be quite different from that in twisted bilayer graphene and
twisted double bilayer graphene.

$u\colon \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$, we define $J_K(u)$ as the integral of

possibly singular in the origin. We study the minimisation of this energy under
prescribed boundary conditions, and we introduce a notion of calibration suited
for this nonlocal problem. Our first result shows that the existence of a
calibration is a sufficient condition for a function to be a minimiser. As an
application of this criterion, we prove that halfspaces are the unique
minimisers of $J_K$ in a ball, provided they are admissible competitors.
Finally, we outline how to exploit the optimality of hyperplanes to recover a
$\Gamma$-convergence result concerning the scaling limit of $J_K$.

average profile is comprised of several distinct components at these epochs and
is stable over $\sim$day timescales and $\sim$GHz frequencies. Comparison with
additional phased VLA data at 8.7 GHz shows significant profile changes on
longer timescales. The average profile at 7-12 GHz is dominated by the jitter
of relatively narrow pulses. The pulses in each of the four main profile
components seen in September 2014 are uncorrelated in phase and amplitude,
though there is a small but significant correlation in the occurrence of pulses
in two of the profile components. Using the brightest pulses, we measure the
dispersion and scattering parameters of J1745-2900. A joint fit of 38 pulses
gives a 10 GHz pulse broadening time of $\tau_{\rm sc, 10} = 0.09 \pm 0.03~\rm

Hence, a new structure-aware deep convolutional neural network that

image structure prediction while the other is for continuous-tone image
reconstruction. First, to predict image structures, patch pairs comprising
continuous-tone patches and the corresponding halftoned patches generated

generated by convolving gradient filters with the continuous-tone patches. The
subnetwork for the image structure prediction is trained using the mini-batch
gradient descent algorithm given the halftoned patches and gradient patches,
which are fed into the input and loss layers of the subnetwork, respectively.
Next, the predicted map including the image structures is stacked on the top of
the input halftoned image through a fusion layer and fed into the image
reconstruction subnetwork such that the entire network is trained adaptively to
the image structures. The experimental results confirm that the proposed
structure-aware network can remove noisy dot-patterns well on flat areas and

T_m$ of a universe $[n]$ along with an integer $k$ and the objective is to find
a subset $S \subseteq [m]$ of size $k$ that maximizes $C(S) := |\cup_{i \in S}
T_i|$. It is well-known that the greedy algorithm for this problem achieves an
approximation ratio of $(1-e^{-1})$ and there is a matching inapproximability
result. We note that in the maximum coverage problem if an element $e \in [n]$
is covered by several sets, it is still counted only once. By contrast, if we
change the problem and count each element $e$ as many times as it is covered,
then we obtain a linear objective function, $C^{(\infty)}(S) = \sum_{i \in S}
|T_i|$, which can be easily maximized under a cardinality constraint.
  We study the maximum $\ell$-multi-coverage problem which naturally
interpolates between these two extremes. In this problem, an element can be
counted up to $\ell$ times but no more; hence, we consider maximizing the
function $C^{(\ell)}(S) = \sum_{e \in [n]} \min\{\ell, |\{i \in S : e \in
T_i\}| \}$, subject to the constraint $|S| \leq k$. Note that the case of $\ell
= 1$ corresponds to the standard maximum coverage setting and $\ell = \infty$
gives us a linear objective.
  We develop an efficient approximation algorithm that achieves an
approximation ratio of $1 - \frac{\ell^{\ell}e^{-\ell}}{\ell!}$ for the
$\ell$-multi-coverage problem. In particular, when $\ell = 2$, this factor is
$1-2e^{-2} \approx 0.73$ and as $\ell$ grows the approximation ratio behaves as
$1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \ell}}$. We also prove that this approximation ratio
is tight, i.e., establish a matching hardness-of-approximation result, under
the Unique Games Conjecture.

generation. However, a key challenge when using GANs is how to best measure
their ability to generate realistic data. In this paper, we demonstrate that an
intrinsic dimensional characterization of the data space learned by a GAN model
leads to an effective evaluation metric for GAN quality. In particular, we
propose a new evaluation measure, CrossLID, that assesses the local intrinsic
dimensionality (LID) of real-world data with respect to neighborhoods found in
GAN-generated samples. Intuitively, CrossLID measures the degree to which
manifolds of two data distributions coincide with each other. In experiments on
4 benchmark image datasets, we compare our proposed measure to several
state-of-the-art evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that CrossLID is
strongly correlated with the progress of GAN training, is sensitive to mode
collapse, is robust to small-scale noise and image transformations, and robust
to sample size. Furthermore, we show how CrossLID can be used within the GAN
training process to improve generation quality.

the potential of being used in dialogical argumentation. They could possibly be

people to eat more fruit, to take regular exercise, etc.) However, to achieve
this, there is a need to develop methods for acquiring appropriate arguments

persuade someone to do regular exercise, the chatbot needs to know
counterarguments that the user might have for not doing exercise. To address

constrained by the recent measurements of Cosmic Microwave Background
anisotropies provided by the Planck Satellite and by the BICEP2 telescope. In
particular, models with power-law potentials $V(\varphi)\propto \varphi^n$ with
$n \ge 2$ are strongly disfavored by present data since they predict a sizable
contribution of gravitational waves with a tensor/scalar ratio of $r\sim0.15$
that is at odds with current limits. A non-minimal coupling to gravity has been
proposed as a physical mechanism to lower the predictions for $r$. In this
paper we further investigate the issue, presenting constraints on non-minimal
couplings from current CMB data under the assumption of power-law potentials.
We found that models with $n>2$ show a statistically significant indication
(above $95 \%$ C.L.) for a non minimal coupling. Non minimal coupling is also
preferred by models with $n<2$ albeit just at about $68 \%$ C.L..
Interestingly, all the models considered show a non-zero running of the
spectral index, $ n_{\rm run}$, consistent with the 2018 Planck release value
of $-0.007 \pm 0.0068$. We point out how future accurate measurement of $
n_{\rm run}$ would be necessary to significantly constraint these models and
eventually rule out some or all of them. The combination of Planck data with
the Bicep/Keck dataset strengthen these considerations.

over datasets, but it assumes attackers that know and can influence all but one
record in the database. This assumption often vastly overapproximates the
attackers' actual strength, resulting in unnecessarily poor utility.
  Recent work has made significant steps towards privacy in the presence of
partial background knowledge, which can model a realistic attacker's
uncertainty. Prior work, however, has definitional problems for correlated data
and does not precisely characterize the underlying attacker model. We propose a
practical criterion to prevent problems due to correlations, and we show how to
characterize attackers with limited influence or only partial background
knowledge over the dataset. We use these foundations to analyze practical
scenarios: we significantly improve known results about the privacy of counting
queries under partial knowledge, and we show that thresholding can provide
formal guarantees against such weak attackers, even with little entropy in the
data. These results allow us to draw novel links between k-anonymity and
differential privacy under partial knowledge. Finally, we prove composition
results on differential privacy with partial knowledge, which quantifies the
privacy leakage of complex mechanisms.
  Our work provides a basis for formally quantifying the privacy of many
widely-used mechanisms, e.g. publishing the result of surveys, elections or
referendums, and releasing usage statistics of online services.

finite volume effects) basis decompositions for lattice vectors and second-rank
tensors. The leading-order non-continuum versions of these representations are
then applied to the Landau gauge gluon propagator and ghost-gluon vertex of
Monte Carlo simulations, to reveal two interesting insights. First, it is
demonstrated numerically and analytically that there exist special kinematic
configurations where the basis descriptions of both functions reduce to their
continuum analogues. Second, for the gluon two-point correlator it is shown
that the rate at which the function approaches its continuum form in the
infrared is independent of the lattice gauge coupling $\beta$ (when working in
lattice units): the said rate depends on kinematics alone and is ultimately
dictated by the numerical gauge-fixing procedure. We also comment on how this

mixtures to sort into separate regions, i.e., demix. Does the same phenomenon
occur in confluent biological tissues? We begin to answer this question for
epithelial monolayers with a combination of theory via a vertex model and
experiments on keratinocyte monolayers. Vertex models are distinct from
particle models in that the interactions between the cells are shape-based, as
opposed to distance-dependent. We investigate whether a disparity in cell shape
or size alone is sufficient to drive demixing in bidisperse vertex model fluid
mixtures. Surprisingly, we observe that both types of bidisperse systems
robustly mix on large lengthscales. On the other hand, shape disparity
generates slight demixing over a few cell diameters, a phenomenon we term
micro-demixing. This result can be understood by examining the differential
energy barriers for neighbor exchanges (T1 transitions). Experiments with
mixtures of wild-type and E-cadherin-deficient keratinocytes on a substrate are
consistent with the predicted phenomenon of micro-demixing, which biology may
exploit to create subtle patterning. The robustness of mixing at large scales,
however, suggests that despite some differences in cell shape and size,
progenitor cells can readily mix throughout a developing tissue until acquiring
means of recognizing cells of different types.

is key to understand the star formation in galaxies. The radiative condensation
of the diffuse warm neutral medium producing a thermally unstable lukewarm
medium and a dense cold medium is closely related to the initial step which
leads the HI-to-H2 transition and the formation of molecular clouds. Up to now
the mapping of these phases out of 21 cm emission hyper-spectral cubes has
remained elusive mostly due to the velocity blending of individual cold
structures present on a given line of sight.
  To address this problem, we developed a new Gaussian decomposition algorithm
named ROHSA (Regularized Optimization for Hyper-Spectral Analysis) based on a
multi-resolution process from coarse to fine grid. ROHSA uses a regularized
non-linear least-square criterion to take into account simultaneously the
spatial coherence of the emission and the multiphase nature of the gas. In
order to obtain a solution with spatially smooth parameters, the optimization
is performed on the whole data cube at once. The performances of ROHSA were
tested on a synthetic observation computed from numerical simulations of
thermally bi-stable turbulence. An application on a 21 cm observation of a high
Galactic latitude region from the GHIGLS survey is presented.
  The evaluation of ROHSA on synthetic 21 cm observations shows that it is able
to recover the multiphase nature of the HI and physically meaningful
information about the underlying three-dimensional fields (density, velocity
and temperature). The application on a real 21 cm observation of a high
Galactic latitude field produces a picture of the multiphase HI, with isolated,
filamentary and narrow structures and wider, diffuse and space filling
components. The test-case field used here contains significant
intermediate-velocity clouds that were well mapped out by the algorithm.

analysis, we find the fixed points of the beam including the space-charge
forces and construct a Jacobi-matrix by slightly perturbing the periodic

analysis. Furthermore, we employ envelope tracking as a complementary method
and compare the results of the eigenvalue analysis with FFT data from the
tracked envelope. The non-linearity of the space-charge force in combination
with lattice errors and beam coupling opens up for envelope-lattice resonances
and envelope coupling resonances. Hitting these resonances leads to envelope

with discrete many-core GPUs (or other specialized hardware accelerators),
enable unprecedented peak performance and energy efficiency levels.
Unfortunately, though, developing applications that can take full advantage of
the potential of heterogeneous systems is a notoriously hard task. This work
takes a step towards reducing the complexity of programming heterogeneous
systems by introducing the abstraction of Heterogeneous Transactional Memory
(HeTM). HeTM provides programmers with the illusion of a single memory region,
shared among the CPUs and the (discrete) GPU(s) of a heterogeneous system, with
support for atomic transactions. Besides introducing the abstract semantics and
programming model of HeTM, we present the design and evaluation of a concrete
implementation of the proposed abstraction, which we named Speculative HeTM
(SHeTM). SHeTM makes use of a novel design that leverages on speculative
techniques and aims at hiding the inherently large communication latency
between CPUs and discrete GPUs and at minimizing inter-device synchronization
overhead. SHeTM is based on a modular and extensible design that allows for
easily integrating alternative TM implementations on the CPU's and GPU's sides,
which allows the flexibility to adopt, on either side, the TM implementation
(e.g., in hardware or software) that best fits the applications' workload and
the architectural characteristics of the processing unit. We demonstrate the
efficiency of the SHeTM via an extensive quantitative study based both on
synthetic benchmarks and on a porting of a popular object caching system.

effectively extended frequency comb emission to longer-wavelength spectral
regions, i.e. the mid and far infrared. Unlike classical pulsed frequency
combs, their mode-locking mechanism relies on four-wave mixing nonlinear
processes, with a temporal intensity profile different from conventional
short-pulses trains. Measuring the absolute phase pattern of the modes in these
combs enables a thorough characterization of the onset of mode-locking in
absence of short-pulses emission, as well as of the coherence properties. Here,
by combining dual-comb multi-heterodyne detection with Fourier-transform
analysis, we show how to simultaneously acquire and monitor over a wide range
of timescales the phase pattern of a generic frequency comb. The technique is
applied to characterize a mid-infrared and a terahertz quantum cascade laser
frequency comb, conclusively proving the high degree of coherence and the
remarkable long-term stability of these sources. Moreover, the technique allows
also the reconstruction of electric field, intensity profile and instantaneous
frequency of the emission.

The vacancy is injected in the top-surface layer of the films with both types

discuss their magnetic properties tight to those of the substrate and
investigate the magnetic crystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). Previous

modified upon the presence of the atomic defects. All investigated defects
induce an in-plane MAE, which is large enough for Fe adatom and Pt vacancy to
switch the surface MAE from out-of-plane to in-plane for the Pt-terminated

mergers carry the imprint of the equation of state due to the tidally deformed
structure of the components. If the stars contain solid crusts, then their
shear modulus can affect the deformability of the star and, thereby, modify the
emitted signal. Here, we investigate the effect of realistic equations of state
(EOSs) of the crustal matter, with a realistic model for the shear modulus of
the stellar crust in a fully general relativistic framework. This allows us to
systematically study the deviations that are expected from fluid models. In
particular, we use unified EOSs, both relativistic and non-relativistic, in our
calculations. We find that realistic EOSs of crusts cause a small correction,
of $\sim 1\%$, in the second Love number. This correction will likely be
subdominant to the statistical error expected in LIGO-Virgo observations at
their respective advanced design sensitivities, but rival that error in third
generation detectors. For completeness, we also study the effect of crustal
shear on the magnetic-type Love number and find it to be much smaller.

applied SWE in the abdominal aortas of rats while increasing blood pressure

pressure and non-invasive arterial diameter measurements. A 15MHz linear array
connected to an ultrafast ultrasonic scanner, set non-invasively, on the
abdominal aorta of anesthetized rats (N=5) was used. The SWE acquisition
followed by an ultrafast (UF) acquisition was repeated at different moment of
the cardiac cycle to assess shear wave speed and arterial diameter variations
respectively. Invasive arterial BP catheter placed in the carotid, allowed the
accurate measurement of pressure responses to increasing does of phenylephrine
infused via a venous catheter. The SWE acquisition coupled to the UF
acquisition was repeated for different range of pressure. For normal range of
BP, the shear wave speed was found to follow the aortic BP variation during a
cardiac cycle. A minimum of (5.06$\pm$0.82) m/s during diastole and a maximum
of (5.97$\pm$0.90) m/s during systole was measured. After injection of
phenylephrine, a strong increase of shear wave speed (13.85$\pm$5.51) m/s was
observed for a peak systolic arterial pressure of (190$\pm$10) mmHg. A
non-linear relationship between shear wave speed and arterial BP was found. A
complete non-invasive method was proposed to characterize the artery with shear

were validated against two parameters the incremental elastic modulus and the

range 0.2-3 keV, which implies an X-ray-to-bolometric flux ratio $f_{\rm

sum of two thermal-plasma components with subsolar abundances at temperatures

in early-type main-sequence stars, where the X-ray emission is attributed to
turbulence and shocks in the stellar wind. Therefore, the same phenomenon could
explain the X-ray properties of Feige 34. However, it is not possible to
reproduce the observed spectrum with a thermal-plasma model if the elemental
abundances are fixed at the values obtained from the optical and UV
spectroscopy. Moreover, we show that the X-ray luminosity and spectrum are
consistent with those expected from a young main-sequence star of late spectral

due to the companion star of M0 spectral type, whose presence is suggested by
the IR excess in the spectral energy distribution of Feige 34.

to the life-time prediction of adhesive anchor systems under sustained load.
The Monkman-Grant relation, which has previously been applied to a wide range
of materials, is now applied to adhesive anchors installed in concrete. It
postulates a linear relationship between the logarithm of stable creep rate and
time to failure. In this paper the criterion is evaluated first on a large
experimental campaign on one concrete involving two chemically different
adhesives and then by several experimental data sets reported in literature. In
all cases the data is well represented and highly accurate predictions are
obtained. The second part of the paper focuses on the relationship between
stable creep rate and relative load level of the remote constant stress based
on the Norton-Bailey and the Prandtl-Garofalo creep laws. The latter was found
to perform better on fitting the experimental data. Finally, the combination of
the Monkman-Grant criterion and the aforementioned creep laws allows the
prediction of stress versus time to failure curves including uncertainty
bounds, that are in very good agreement with all experimental data sets, making
it an interesting alternative to existing test methods for adhesive anchor
systems under sustained loads.

there is a well-known correspondence between channels and states, and one can
imagine adapting \emph{state} sampling methods to sample quantum channels.
Here, we discuss such an adaptation, using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method,
a well-known classical method capable of producing high quality samples from
arbitrary, user-specified distributions. Its implementation requires an exact
parameterization of the space of quantum channels, with no superfluous
parameters and no constraints. We construct such a parameterization, and
demonstrate its use in three common channel sampling applications.

configuration to a dipole configuration, when one approaches the monopole
position in the parameter space, is analyzed in an exactly solvable model. A
novel aspect of Berry's connection ${\cal A}_{k}$ is that the geometrical
center of the monopole-like configuration and the origin of the Dirac string
are displaced in the parameter space. Gauss' theorem $\int_{S}(\nabla\times
{\cal A})\cdot d\vec{S}=\int_{V} \nabla\cdot (\nabla\times {\cal A}) dV=0$ for
a volume $V$ which is free of singularities shows that a combination of the
monopole-like configuration and the Dirac string is effectively a dipole. The
smooth topology change from a dipole to a monopole with a quantized magnetic
charge $e_{M}=2\pi\hbar$ takes place when one regards the Dirac string as
unobservable if it satisfies the Wu-Yang gauge invariance condition. In the
transitional region from a dipole to a monopole, a half-monopole appears with
an observable Dirac string, which is analogous to the Aharonov-Bohm phase of an
electron for the magnetic flux generated by the Cooper pair condensation. The
main topological features of an exactly solvable model are shown to be
supported by a generic model of Berry's phase.

for multi-criteria analysis and decision making. The skyline consists of all
points that are not dominated by any other points. It is a candidate set of the
optimal solution, which depends on a specific evaluation criterion for optimum.
However, conventional skyline queries, which return individual points, are
inadequate in group querying case since optimal combinations are required. To
address this gap, we study the skyline computation in the group level and
propose efficient methods to find the Group-based skyline (G-skyline). For
computing the front $l$ skyline layers, we lay out an efficient approach that
does the search concurrently on each dimension and investigates each point in
the subspace. After that, we present a novel structure to construct the
G-skyline with a queue of combinations of the first-layer points. We further
demonstrate that the G-skyline is a complete candidate set of top-$l$
solutions, which is the main superiority over previous group-based skyline
definitions. However, as G-skyline is complete, it contains a large number of
groups which can make it impractical. To represent the ""contour"" of the
G-skyline, we define the Representative G-skyline (RG-skyline). Then, we
propose a Group-based clustering (G-clustering) algorithm to find out
RG-skyline groups. Experimental results show that our algorithms are several
orders of magnitude faster than the previous work.

C (89 $\mu$m) and D (154 $\mu$m). The slope of the polarization spectrum was
investigated by defining the quantity R_DC = p_D/p_C, where p_C and p_D
represent polarization degrees in bands C and D, respectively. We find a clear
correlation between R_DC and the molecular hydrogen column density across the
cloud. A positive slope (R_DC > 1) dominates the lower density and well
illuminated portions of the cloud, that are heated by the high mass star Oph
S1, whereas a transition to a negative slope (R_DC < 1) is observed toward the
denser and less evenly illuminated cloud core. We interpret the trends as due
to a combination of: (1) Warm grains at the cloud outskirts, which are
efficiently aligned by the abundant exposure to radiation from Oph S1, as
proposed in the radiative torques theory; and (2) Cold grains deep in the cloud
core, which are poorly aligned due to shielding from external radiation. To
assess this interpretation, we developed a very simple toy model using a
spherically symmetric cloud core based on Herschel data, and verified that the
predicted variation of R_DC is consistent with the observations. This result
introduces a new method that can be used to probe the grain alignment
efficiency in molecular clouds, based on the analysis of trends in the
far-infrared polarization spectrum.

the main problems of supergravity inflation, allowing for: naturally small
slow-roll parameters, small field initial conditions, absence of a
(pseudo)scalar companion of the inflation, and a nearby minimum with tuneable
cosmological constant. It contains a chiral multiplet charged under a gauged
R-symmetry which is restored at the maximum of the scalar potential with a
plateau where inflation takes place. The effective field theory relies on two
phenomenological parameters corresponding to corrections to the K\""ahler
potential up to second order around the origin. The first guarantees the
maximum at the origin and the second allows the tuning of the vacuum energy
between the F- and D-term contributions. Here, we provide a microscopic model
leading to the required effective theory. It is a Fayet-Iliopoulos model with
two charged chiral multiplets under a second U(1) R-symmetry coupled to
supergravity. In the Brout-Englert-Higgs phase of this U(1), the gauge field
becomes massive and can be integrated out in the limit of small supersymmetry
breaking scale. In this work, we perform this integration and we show that
there is a region of parameter space where the effective supergravity realises
our proposal of small field inflation from supersymmetry breaking consistently
with observations and with a minimum of tuneable energy that can describe the
present phase of our Universe.

principal component analysis is regularly used for estimating signal structures

is replaced by one odd and one even high-order function and including the
characteristic zig-zag behaviour by means of piecewise linear functions. In
order to account for arbitrary lamination schemes, four such piecewise

in long text content such as newspaper opinion articles. Obtaining long text
data and annotations at sufficient scale for training is difficult, but it is
relatively easy to extract political polarity from tweets through their
authorship; as such, we train on tweets and perform inference on articles.
Universal sentence encoders and other existing methods that aim to address this
domain-adaptation scenario deliver inaccurate and inconsistent predictions on
articles, which we show is due to a difference in opinion concentration between
tweets and articles. We propose a two-step classification scheme that utilizes
a neutral detector trained on tweets to remove neutral sentences from articles
in order to align opinion concentration and therefore improve accuracy on that
domain.
  We evaluate our two-step approach using a variety of test suites, including a
set of tweets and long-form articles where annotations were crowd-sourced to
decrease label noise, measuring accuracy and Spearman-rho rank correlation. In
practice, KnowBias achieves a high accuracy of 86 (rho = 0.65) on these tweets
and 75 (rho = 0.69) on long-form articles. While we validate our method on
political bias, our scheme is general and can be readily applied to other
settings, where there exist such domain mismatches between source and target
domains. Our implementation is available for public use at https://knowbias.ml.

reusable resource are used to serve customers. Customers arrive to the system
according to a stochastic process and upon arrival decide whether or not to
purchase the service, depending on their willingness-to-pay and the current
price. The service time during which the resource is used by the customer is
stochastic and the firm may incur a service cost. This model represents various
markets for reusable resources such as cloud computing, shared vehicles,
rotable parts, and hotel rooms. In the present paper, we analyze this pricing
problem when the firm attempts to maximize a weighted combination of three
central metrics: profit, market share, and service level. Under Poisson
arrivals, exponential service times, and standard assumptions on the
willingness-to-pay distribution, we establish a series of results that
characterize the performance of static pricing in such environments.
  In particular, while an optimal policy is fully dynamic in such a context, we
prove that a static pricing policy simultaneously guarantees 78.9% of the
profit, market share, and service level from the optimal policy. Notably, this
result holds for any service rate and number of units the firm operates. Our
proof technique relies on a judicious construction of a static price that is
derived directly from the optimal dynamic pricing policy. In the special case
where there are two units and the induced demand is linear, we also prove that
the static policy guarantees 95.5% of the profit from the optimal policy. Our
numerical findings on a large testbed of instances suggest that the latter
result is quite indicative of the profit obtained by the static pricing policy
across all parameters.

interest in the scene explicitly, without further use of visual features.
  Initially, we recognize that human hands are essential in the execution of
actions and focus on obtaining their movements as the principal cues that
define actions. We employ object detection and region tracking techniques to
locate hands and capture their movements. Prior knowledge about egocentric
views facilitates hand identification between left and right. With regard to
detection and tracking, we contribute a pipeline that successfully operates on
unseen egocentric videos to find the camera wearer's hands and associate them
through time. Moreover, we emphasize on the value of scene information for
action recognition. We acknowledge that the presence of objects is significant
for the execution of actions by humans and in general for the description of a
scene. To acquire this information, we utilize object detection for specific
classes that are relevant to the actions we want to recognize.
  Our experiments are targeted on videos of kitchen activities from the
Epic-Kitchens dataset. We model action recognition as a sequence learning
problem of the detected spatial positions in the frames. Our results show that
explicit hand and object detections with no other visual information can be
relied upon to classify hand-related human actions. Testing against methods
fully dependent on visual features, signals that for actions where hand motions
are conceptually important, a region-of-interest-based description of a video

leaps in different pattern recognition tasks including action recognition.
Current CNNs are increasingly deeper, data-hungrier and this makes their
success tributary of the abundance of labeled training data. CNNs also rely on
max/average pooling which reduces dimensionality of output layers and hence
attenuates their sensitivity to the availability of labeled data. However, this
process may dilute the information of upstream convolutional layers and thereby
affect the discrimination power of the trained representations, especially when
the learned categories are fine-grained.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel hierarchical aggregation design, for
final pooling, that controls granularity of the learned representations w.r.t
the actual granularity of action categories. Our solution is based on a
tree-structured temporal pyramid that aggregates outputs of CNNs at different
levels. Top levels of this hierarchy are dedicated to coarse categories while
deep levels are more suitable to fine-grained ones. The design of our temporal
pyramid is based on solving a constrained minimization problem whose solution
corresponds to the distribution of weights of different representations in the
temporal pyramid. Experiments conducted using the challenging UCF101 database

analysis, we investigate how this information, which comes from supernova data
only, depends on different survey parameters such as covered area, depth, and
duration. We show that, for a survey like The Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey
of Space and Time (LSST) and a fixed redshift depth, the same observing time
provides the same cosmological information whether one observes a larger area,
or a smaller area during more years. We also show that although the peculiar
velocity information is peaked in the range $z \in [0, 0.2]$, there is yet
plenty of information in $z \in [0.2, 0.5]$, and for very high supernova number
densities there is even more information in the latter range. We conclude that,
after 5 years, LSST could measure $\sigma_8$ with an uncertainty of 0.17 with
the current strategy, and that this could be improved to 0.09 if the supernova
completeness is improved to 20%. Moreover, we forecast results considering the

establishes a link between the structural and dynamical properties of

observed pulse width, DM, and even brightness distributions depend strongly on
the time and frequency resolution of the detection instrument. Spectral and
temporal resolution also significantly affect FRB detection rates, similar to
beam size and system-equivalent flux density (SEFD). I discuss the interplay
between underlying FRB properties and instrumental response, and provide a
generic formalism for calculating the \textit{observed} distributions of
parameters given an intrinsic FRB distribution, focusing on pulse width and DM.
I argue that if there exist many FRBs of duration $<<$\,1\,ms (as with giant
pulses from Galactic pulsars) or events with high DM, they are being missed due
to the deleterious effects of smearing. I outline how to optimise spectral and
temporal resolution for FRB surveys that are throughput-limited. I also
investigate how such effects may have been imprinted on the distributions of
FRBs at real telescopes, like the different observed DMs at ASKAP and Parkes.

seas of liquid hydrocarbons. These liquid bodies, which are in polar regions

surfaces despite evidence of near-surface winds. Photochemically generated
organic aerosols form a haze that can settle and potentially interact with the

Titan's seas and their potential to dampen waves. We find that the majority of
aerosols are denser than the liquid hydrocarbons, but that some could have
liquid-repelling properties. From calculation of the capillary forces, we
propose that these 'liquidophobic' aerosols could float and form a persistent
film on Titan's seas. We numerically model the wave damping efficiency of such
a film under the conditions on Titan, demonstrating that even a film one

large-scale plastic deformation and significant rejuvenation when the annealing

between the samples from one cluster and the samples from the other cluster,
and (ii) removing at each step the most discriminant features. The
faster-decreasing accuracy rates of the intermediately-obtained classifiers
indicate that the two clusters should be joined. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to apply unmasking in order to cluster images. We
compare our method with k-means as well as a recent state-of-the-art clustering

applications in scheduling, service level agreements and error detection.
During query planning, a cost is associated with the chosen execution plan and
used to rank competing plans. It would be convenient to use that cost to
predict execution time, but it has been claimed in the literature that this is
not possible. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate this claim considering
both linear and non-linear models. We find that the accuracy using more complex
models with only the optimizer cost is comparable to the reported accuracy in
the literature. The most accurate method in the literature is nearest-neighbour
regression which does not produce a model. The published results used a large
feature set to identify nearest neighbours. We show that it is possible to
achieve the same level of accuracy using only the cost to identify nearest
neighbours. Using a smaller feature set brings the advantages of reduced
overhead in terms of both storage space for the training data and the time to
produce a prediction.

discuss the astrophysical origin of the delay time, $\Delta t$, of GW-GRB
associations within the context of compact binary coalescence (CBC) -- short
GRB (sGRB) associations and GW burst -- long GRB (lGRB) associations. In
general, the delay time should include three terms, the time to launch a clean
(relativistic) jet, $\Delta t_{\rm jet}$; the time for the jet to break out
from the surrounding medium, $\Delta t_{\rm bo}$; and the time for the jet to
reach the energy dissipation and GRB emission site, $\Delta t_{\rm GRB}$. For
CBC-sGRB associations, $\Delta t_{\rm jet}$ and $\Delta t_{\rm bo}$ are
correlated, and the final delay can be from 10 ms to a few seconds. For
GWB-lGRB associations, $\Delta t_{\rm jet}$ and $\Delta t_{\rm bo}$ are
independent. The latter is at least $\sim$10 s, so that $\Delta t$ of these
associations is at least this long. For certain jet launching mechanisms of
lGRBs, $\Delta t$ can be minutes or even hours long due to the extended engine
waiting time $\Delta t_{\rm wait}$ to launch a jet. We discuss the cases of
GW170817/GRB 170817A and GW150914/GW150914-GBM within this theoretical

elucidate the 3$\alpha$-condensate-like character of the Hoyle state ($0_2^+$
state) of $^{12}$C. We briefly review the cluster-model studies of the Hoyle
state in 1970's in order to explain how there emerged the idea to assign the
$\alpha$ condensate character to the Hoyle state. We then explain that the THSR
wave function can describe very well also non-gaslike ordinary cluster states
with spatial localization of clusters. This fact means that the dynamical
motion of clusters is of nonlocalized nature just as in gas-like states of
clusters and the localization of clusters is due to the inter-cluster Pauli
principle which is against the close approach of two clusters. The nonlocalized
cluster dynamics is formulated by the container model of cluster dynamics. The
container model describes gas-like state and non-gaslike states as the
solutions of the Hill-Wheeler equation with respect to the size parameter of
THSR wave function which is just the size parameter of the container. When we
notice that fact that the THSR wave function with the smallest value of size
parameter is equivalent to the shell-model wave function, we see that the
container model describes the evolution of cluster structure from the ground
state with shell-model structure up to the gas-like cluster state via ordinary
non-gaslike cluster states. For the description of various cluster structure,
more generation of THSR wave function have been introduced and we review some

on $M$, respectively. It has been proved by Bonnet and Miltzow (2016) that
$f(M)=O(n^2)$ and by van Leeuwen and Schoone (1980) that $F(M)=O(n^3)$. We
prove that $f(M)=O(n\Delta)$ where $\Delta$ is the spread of the point set,
which is defined as the ratio between the longest and the shortest pairwise
distances. This improves the previous bound if the point set has sublinear
spread. For a matching $M$ on $n$ points in convex position we prove that
$f(M)=n/2-1$ and $F(M)={{n/2} \choose 2}$; these bounds are tight.
  Any bound on $F(\cdot)$ carries over to the bichromatic setting, while this
is not necessarily true for $f(\cdot)$. Let $M'$ be a bichromatic matching. The
best known upper bound for $f(M')$ is the same as for $F(M')$, which is
essentially $O(n^3)$. We prove that $f(M')\le n-2$ for points in convex
position, and $f(M')= O(n^2)$ for semi-collinear points.
  The flip operation can also be defined on spanning trees. For a spanning tree
$T$ on a convex point set we show that $f(T)=O(n\log n)$.

below 1e-8 (with respect to the total proton density) and the predicted column
densities in simulated cold cores is at maximum a few 1e14 cm-2, in agreement

fact that, in a large fraction of the interstellar material, the atomic oxygen
is depleted onto the grain surface (and hydrogenated to form H2O) before O2 can
be formed in the gas-phase and protected from UV photo-dissociations. We could
achieve this result only because we took into account the full history of the

extrapolation but could not be detected in multi-wavelength images at the

fields in the photosphere are considered to be responsible for the flux rope
formation. The maximum twist of the flux rope is as high as -1.76, and then the
flux rope rises due to the kink instability. Only when the flare starts can the
flux rope be observed in high-temperature wavelengths. The differential
emission measure results confirm that this flux rope is a high-temperature

reconnects with the large-scale overlying field lines, a set of large-scale
twisted loops are formed, and two flare ribbons propagating in opposite

twist of the flux rope is transferred to a much larger system. These results

verification of homogeneous and dynamic concurrent multi-agent transition
systems (HDMAS). Homogeneity means that all agents have the same available
actions at any given state and the actions have the same effects regardless of
which agents perform them. The state transitions are therefore determined only
by the vector of numbers of agents performing each action and are specified
symbolically, by means of conditions on these numbers definable in Presburger
arithmetic. The agents are divided into controllable (by the system
supervisor/controller) and uncontrollable, representing the environment or
adversary. Dynamicity means that the numbers of controllable and uncontrollable
agents may vary throughout the system evolution, possibly at every transition.
  As a language for formal specification we use a suitably extended version of
Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL), where one can specify properties of the
type ""a coalition of (at least) $n$ controllable agents can ensure against (at
most) $m$ uncontrollable agents that any possible evolution of the system
satisfies a given objective $\varphi$"", where $\varphi$ is specified again as a
formula of that language and each of $n$ and $m$ is either a fixed number or a
variable that can be quantified over.
  We provide formal semantics to our logic $\mathcal{L}_{HDMAS}$ and define
normal form of its formulae. We then prove that every formula in
$\mathcal{L}_{HDMAS}$ is equivalent in the finite to one in a normal form and
develop an algorithm for global model checking of formulae in normal form in
finite HDMAS models, which invokes model checking truth of Presburger formulae.

Universe. This observation yielded the first constraints on the equation of
state (EoS) of NS matter from the GW imprint of tidal interactions. Tidal
signatures in the GW arise from the response of a matter object to the
spacetime curvature sourced by its binary companion. They crucially depend on
the EoS and are predominantly characterised by the tidal deformability
parameters $\Lambda_{\ell}$, where $\ell=2,3$ denotes the quadrupole and
octupole respectively. As the binary evolves towards merger, additional
dynamical tidal effects become important when the orbital frequency approaches
a resonance with the stars' internal oscillation modes. Among these modes, the
fundamental ($f_\ell$-)modes have the strongest tidal coupling and can give
rise to a cumulative imprint in the GW signal even if the resonance is not
fully excited. Here we present the first direct constraints on fundamental
oscillation mode frequencies for GW170817 using an inspiral GW phase model with
an explicit dependence on the $f$-mode frequency and without assuming any
relation between $f_\ell$ and $\Lambda_\ell$. We rule out anomalously small

dynamic tides associated with the neutron stars' fundamental oscillation modes

that, despite its mathematical simplicity, the new ""$f$-mode tidal"" (fmtidal)

to GW frequencies of $\gtrsim 1$ kHz and gives physical meaning to part of the

advantages of the fmtidal model are that it makes explicit the dependence of
the GW phasing on the characteristic equation-of-state parameters, i.e., tidal

it can readily be added to any frequency-domain baseline waveform. The fmtidal
model is easily amenable to future improvements and provides the means for a
first step towards independently measuring additional fundamental properties of
neutron star matter beyond the tidal deformability as well as performing novel
tests of general relativity from GW observations.

Rather than running the prediction model over the entire dataset, multiple
shooting splits the data into smaller subsets and runs the prediction model
over each subset, making the simulation length a design parameter and making it
possible to solve problems that would be infeasible using a standard approach.
The equivalence to the original problem is obtained by including constraints in
the optimization. The new method is illustrated by estimating the parameters of

Then there comes a subclass of machine learning, known as deep learning, to
address the limitations of their predecessors. AI has generally acquired its
prominence over the past few years due to its considerable progress in various
fields. AI has vastly invaded the realm of research. This has led physicists to
attentively direct their research towards implementing AI tools. Their central
aim has been to gain better understanding and enrich their intuition. This
review article is meant to supplement the previously presented efforts to
bridge the gap between AI and physics, and take a serious step forward to
filter out the ""Babelian"" clashes brought about from such gabs. This
necessitates first to have fundamental knowledge about common AI tools. To this
end, the review's primary focus shall be on deep learning models called
artificial neural networks. They are deep learning models which train
themselves through different learning processes. It discusses also the concept
of Markov decision processes. Finally, shortcut to the main goal, the review
thoroughly examines how these neural networks are capable to construct a
physical theory describing some observations without applying any previous

data into a union of low-dimensional subspaces. Based on spectral clustering,
state-of-the-art approaches solve SC problem within a two-stage framework. In
the first stage, data representation techniques are applied to draw an affinity
matrix from the original data. In the second stage, spectral clustering is
directly applied to the affinity matrix so that data can be grouped into
different subspaces. However, the affinity matrix obtained in the first stage
usually fails to reveal the authentic relationship between data points, which
leads to inaccurate clustering results. In this paper, we propose a universal
Three-Stage Subspace Clustering framework (3S-SC). Graph-Based Transformation
and Optimization (GBTO) is added between data representation and spectral
clustering. The affinity matrix is obtained in the first stage, then it goes
through the second stage, where the proposed GBTO is applied to generate a
reconstructed affinity matrix with more authentic similarity between data
points. Spectral clustering is applied after GBTO, which is the third stage. We
verify our 3S-SC framework with GBTO through theoretical analysis. Experiments

The calculation is carried out within a quantum field theoretic model of strong
low-energy pion--nucleon interactions described by the linear sigma-model (LsM)
with chiral SU(2)xSU(2) symmetry and electroweak hadron-hadron, hadron-lepton
and lepton-lepton interactions for the electron-lepton family with SU(2)_L x
U(1)_Y symmetry of the Standard Electroweak Model (SEM). Such a quantum field
theoretic model is some kind a hadronized version of the Standard Model (SM).
From a gauge invariant set of the Feynman diagrams with one-photon exchanges we
reproduce Sirlin's radiative corrections of order O(alpha/pi), calculated to
leading order in the large nucleon mass expansion, and calculate
next-to-leading corrections of order O(alpha E_e/m_N). This confirms Sirlin's
confidence level of the radiative corrections O(alpha E_e/m_N). The
contributions of the LsM are taken in the limit of the infinite mass of the

form of effective chiral Lagrangians of pion-nucleon interactions with

attachment figures (e.g. family members, friends, colleagues, familiar places
or objects) when faced with threat. During disasters, this means that family
members may seek each other before evacuating, gather personal property before
heading to familiar exits and places, or follow groups/crowds, etc. This
hard-wired human tendency should be considered in the assessment of risk and
the creation of disaster management plans. Doing so may result in more
realistic evacuation procedures and may minimise the number of casualties and
injuries. In this context, a dynamic spatio-temporal analysis of seismic risk
is presented using SOLACE, a multi-agent model of pedestrian behaviour based on
social attachment theory implemented using the Belief-Desire-Intention
approach. The model focuses on the influence of human, social, physical and
temporal factors on successful evacuation. Human factors considered include
perception and mobility defined by age. Social factors are defined by
attachment bonds, social groups, population distribution, and cultural norms.
Physical factors refer to the location of the epicentre of the earthquake,
spatial distribution/layout and attributes of environmental objects such as
buildings, roads, barriers (cars), placement of safe areas, evacuation routes,
and the resulting debris/damage from the earthquake. Experiments tested the
influence of time of the day, presence of disabled persons and earthquake
intensity. Initial results show that factors that influence arrivals in safe
areas include (a) human factors (age, disability, speed), (b) pre-evacuation
behaviours, (c) perception distance (social attachment, time of day), (d)
social interaction during evacuation, and (e) physical and spatial aspects,
such as limitations imposed by debris (damage), and the distance to safe areas.
To validate the results, scenarios will be designed with stakeholders, who will
also take part in the definition of a serious game. The recommendation of this
research is that both social and physical aspects should be considered when
defining vulnerability in the analysis of risk.

asymptotically flat curved surface undergoes a geometric scattering that is
sensitive to the mean and Gaussian curvatures of the surface. A careful study
of possible realizations of this phenomenon in typical condensed matter systems
requires dealing with the presence of defects. We examine the effect of
delta-function point defects residing on a curved surface ${S}$. In particular,
we solve the scattering problem for a multi-delta-function potential in plane,
which requires a proper regularization of divergent terms entering its
scattering amplitude, and include the effects of nontrivial geometry of ${S}$
by treating it as a perturbation of the plane. This allows us to obtain
analytic expressions for the geometric scattering amplitude for a surface
consisting of one or more Gaussian bumps. In general the presence of the
delta-function defects enhances the geometric scattering effects.

While recent developments on visually-aware recommender systems have taken the
product image into account, none of them has considered the aesthetic aspect.
We argue that the aesthetic factor is very important in modeling and predicting
users' preferences, especially for some fashion-related domains like clothing
and jewelry. This work addresses the need of modeling aesthetic information in
visually-aware recommender systems. Technically speaking, we make three key
contributions in leveraging deep aesthetic features: (1) To describe the
aesthetics of products, we introduce the aesthetic features extracted from
product images by a deep aesthetic network. We incorporate these features into
recommender system to model users' preferences in the aesthetic aspect. (2)
Since in clothing recommendation, time is very important for users to make
decision, we design a new tensor decomposition model for implicit feedback
data. The aesthetic features are then injected to the basic tensor model to
capture the temporal dynamics of aesthetic preferences (e.g., seasonal
patterns). (3) We also use the aesthetic features to optimize the learning
strategy on implicit feedback data. We enrich the pairwise training samples by
considering the similarity among items in the visual space and graph space; the
key idea is that a user may likely have similar perception on similar items. We
perform extensive experiments on several real-world datasets and demonstrate
the usefulness of aesthetic features and the effectiveness of our proposed
methods.

value of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and that the solution of the dark
energy problem depends on this value. However, background space in General
Relativity (GR) is only a classical notion while on quantum level symmetry is
defined by a Lie algebra of basic operators. We prove that the theory based on
Poincare Lie algebra is a special degenerate case of the theories based on de
Sitter (dS) or anti-de Sitter (AdS) Lie algebras in the formal limit
$R\to\infty$ where R is the parameter of contraction from the latter algebras
to the former one, and $R$ has nothing to do with the radius of background
space. As a consequence, $R$ is necessarily finite, is fundamental to the same
extent as $c$ and $\hbar$, and a question why $R$ is as is does not arise.
Following our previous publications, we consider a system of two free bodies in
dS quantum mechanics and show that in semiclassical approximation the
cosmological dS acceleration is necessarily nonzero and is the same as in GR if
the radius of dS space equals $R$ and $\Lambda=3/R^2$. This result follows from
basic principles of quantum theory. It has nothing to do with existence or
nonexistence of dark energy and therefore for explaining cosmological
acceleration dark energy is not needed. The result is obtained without using
the notion of dS background space (in particular, its metric and connection)
but simply as a consequence of quantum mechanics based on the dS Lie algebra.
Therefore, $\Lambda$ has a physical meaning only on classical level and the
cosmological constant problem and the dark energy problem do not arise.

importance measures proposed for random forests, partial dependence plots, and
individual conditional expectation plots remain popular because they are both
model-agnostic and depend only on the pre-trained model output, making them
computationally efficient and widely available in software. However, numerous
studies have found that these tools can produce diagnostics that are highly
misleading, particularly when there is strong dependence among features. The
purpose of our work here is to (i) review this growing body of literature, (ii)
provide further demonstrations of these drawbacks along with a detailed
explanation as to why they occur, and (iii) advocate for alternative measures
that involve additional modeling. In particular, we describe how breaking
dependencies between features in hold-out data places undue emphasis on sparse
regions of the feature space by forcing the original model to extrapolate to
regions where there is little to no data. We explore these effects across
various model setups and find support for previous claims in the literature
that PaP metrics can vastly over-emphasize correlated features in both variable
importance measures and partial dependence plots. As an alternative, we discuss
and recommend more direct approaches that involve measuring the change in model
performance after muting the effects of the features under investigation.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Zig-Bee. However, replacing these batteries at
scale is a non-trivial, labor-intensive task. Energy harvesting has emerged as
a potential solution to avoid battery replacement but requires compromises such
as application specific sensor node design, simplified communication protocol
or reduced quality of service. We show the design of a battery-free sensor node
using commercial off the shelf components, and present Pible: a Perpetual
Indoor BLE sensor node that uses an ambient light energy harvesting system and
can support numerous smart building applications. We show trade-offs between
node-lifetime, quality of service and light availability and present a
predictive algorithm that adapts to changing lighting conditions to maximize
node lifetime and application quality of service.

  Computing","A version of this work is to appear in a DAC 2019 Special Session as
  an Invited Paper in June 2019. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap
  with arXiv:1903.03988",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern computing systems suffer from the dichotomy between computation on one
side, which is performed only in the processor (and accelerators), and data
storage/movement on the other, which all other parts of the system are
dedicated to. Due to this dichotomy, data moves a lot in order for the system
to perform computation on it. Unfortunately, data movement is extremely
expensive in terms of energy and latency, much more so than computation. As a
result, a large fraction of system energy is spent and performance is lost
solely on moving data in a modern computing system.
  In this work, we re-examine the idea of reducing data movement by performing
Processing in Memory (PIM). PIM places computation mechanisms in or near where
the data is stored (i.e., inside the memory chips, in the logic layer of
3D-stacked logic and DRAM, or in the memory controllers), so that data movement
between the computation units and memory is reduced or eliminated. While the
idea of PIM is not new, we examine two new approaches to enabling PIM: 1)
exploiting analog properties of DRAM to perform massively-parallel operations
in memory, and 2) exploiting 3D-stacked memory technology design to provide
high bandwidth to in-memory logic. We conclude by discussing work on solving
key challenges to the practical adoption of PIM.

with three kinds of agents who are respectively the Seeds, the Agnostics and
the Others. While Seeds are the ones who start spreading the rumor being
adamantly convinced of its truth, Agnostics reject any kind of rumor and do not
believe in conspiracy theories. In between, the Others constitute the main part
of the community. While Seeds are always Believers and Agnostics are always
Indifferents, Others can switch between being Believer and Indifferent
depending on who they are discussing with. The underlying driving dynamics is
implemented via local updates of randomly formed groups of agents. In each
group, an Other turns into a Believer as soon as $m$ or more Believers are
present in the group. However, since some Believers may lose interest in the
rumor as time passes by, we add a flipping fixed rate $0<d<1$ from Believers
into Indifferents. Rigorous analysis of the associated dynamics reveals that
switching from $m=1$ to $m\ge2$ triggers a drastic qualitative change in the
spreading process. When $m=1$ even a small group of Believers may manage to
convince a large part of the community very quickly. In contrast, for $m\ge 2$,
even a substantial fraction of Believers does not prevent the rumor dying out
after a few update rounds. Our results provide an explanation on why a given
rumor spreads within a social group and not in another, and also why some
rumors will not spread in neither groups.

resonance frequency and the delay line of SAW devices are depending on the
properties of materials forming the device and could be very sensitive to the

passive (batteryless) and/or wireless. These interesting properties combined
with a small size, a low cost radio request system and a small antennas when
operating at high frequency, offer new and exiting perspectives for wireless

the devices are properly selected, it becomes possible to use those sensors
without embedded electronic in hostile environments (as high temperature,

they do not allow identification above 400$^\circ$C. The latter would require
the use of a piezoelectric substrate providing a large electromechanical

letter, we investigate the potentiality of stoichiometric lithium niobate (sLN)

sLN crystals withstand high temperatures up to 800$^\circ$C, at least for
several days. In situ measurements of sLN-based SAW resonators conducted up to

achievement of identifiable wireless high-temperature SAW sensors.
