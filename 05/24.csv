correlated states is presented following the Haldane's state counting. It
relies upon a conjecture to deal with the multiple exclusion that takes place
when the states available to single particles are spatially correlated and it
can be simultaneously excluded by more than one particle. The Haldane's
statistics [F. D. M. Haldane, Phys. Rev. Lett. 67, 937 (1991)] and Wu's
distribution [Y.-S. Wu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 52, 2103 (1984)] are recovered in the
limit of non-correlated states (constant statistical exclusion) of the multiple
exclusion statistics. In addition, the exclusion spectrum function $G(n)$ is
introduced to account for the dependence of the statistical exclusion on the
occupation-number $n$. Results of thermodynamics and state occupation are shown
for ideal lattice gases of linear particles of size $k$ ($k$-mers) where
multiple exclusion occurs. Remarkable agreement is found with simulations from
$k=2$ to $10$ where multiple exclusion dominates as $k$ increases.

limit ourselves to two-atomic molecules. The consideration is much more complex
than for atomic endohedrals because the system even for almost spherical
fullerenes has only cylindrical instead of spherical symmetry. On the other
hand, molecular endohedral is more interesting since the interelectron
interaction in molecules is relatively stronger than in similar atoms. We
present here results of calculations of molecular hydrogen stuffed inside
almost spherical fullerene. For comparison, we perform calculations also for
atomic endohedral with Helium inside fullerene. The results are obtained both
in the single-electron Hartree-Fock approximation and with account of
multi-electron correlations in the frame of so-called random phase
approximation with exchange. The presence of the fullerenes shell results in
prominent oscillations in the endohedrals photoionization cross section. The
role of interelectron correlations becomes clear by comparing HF and RPAE
results for molecular and atomic endohedral on the one side with that for
corresponding isolated molecule and atom on the other.

foremost step to qualify TMDs for use in NIR photonics. Here we measure the

autonomous, mutually-distrusting parties cooperate safely and effectively?
Addressing this challenge brings up questions familiar from classical
distributed systems: how to combine multiple steps into a single atomic action,
how to recover from failures, and how to synchronize concurrent access to data.
Nevertheless, each of these issues requires rethinking when participants are
autonomous and potentially adversarial.
  We propose the notion of a *cross-chain deal*, a new way to structure complex
distributed computations that manage assets in an adversarial setting. Deals
are inspired by classical atomic transactions, but are necessarily different,
in important ways, to accommodate the decentralized and untrusting nature of
the exchange. We describe novel safety and liveness properties, along with two
alternative protocols for implementing cross-chain deals in a system of
independent blockchain ledgers. One protocol, based on synchronous
communication, is fully decentralized, while the other, based on
semi-synchronous communication, requires a globally shared ledger.

nonlinear fluid-structure-contact interaction (FSCI) problems. The underlying
continuous formulation includes both ""no-slip"" fluid-structure interaction as
well as frictionless contact between multiple elastic bodies. The respective
interface conditions in normal and tangential orientation and especially the
role of the fluid stress within the region of closed contact are discussed for
the general problem of FSCI. To ensure continuity of the tangential constraints
from no-slip to frictionless contact, a transition is enabled by using the
general Navier condition with varying slip length. Moreover, the fluid stress
in the contact zone is obtained by an extension approach as it plays a crucial
role for the lift-off behavior of contacting bodies. With the given continuity
of the spatially continuous formulation, continuity of the discrete problem
(which is essential for the convergence of Newton's method) is reached
naturally. As topological changes of the fluid domain are an inherent challenge
in FSCI configurations, a non-interface fitted Cut Finite Element Method
(CutFEM) is applied to discretize the fluid domain. All interface conditions,
that is the `no-slip' FSI, the general Navier condition, and frictionless
contact are incorporated using Nitsche based methods, thus retaining the
continuity and consistency of the model. To account for the strong interaction
between the fluid and solid discretization, the overall coupled discrete system
is solved monolithically. Numerical examples of varying complexity are
presented to corroborate the developments.

commonly utilized to predict pressure drop. Such simulators are typically based
on either empirical correlations or first-principles mechanistic models. The
simulators allow evaluating the pressure drop in multiphase pipe flow with
acceptable accuracy. However, the only shortcoming of these correlations and
mechanistic models is their applicability. In order to extend the applicability
and the accuracy of the existing accessible methods, a method of pressure drop
calculation in the pipeline is proposed. The method is based on well
segmentation and calculation of the pressure gradient in each segment using
three surrogate models based on Machine Learning algorithms trained on a
representative lab data set from the open literature. The first model predicts
the value of a liquid holdup in the segment, the second one determines the flow
pattern, and the third one is used to estimate the pressure gradient. To build
these models, several ML algorithms are trained such as Random Forest, Gradient
Boosting Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Network,
and their predictive abilities are cross-compared. The proposed method for
pressure gradient calculation yields $R^2 = 0.95$ by using the Gradient
Boosting algorithm as compared with $R^2 = 0.92$ in case of Mukherjee and Brill
correlation and $R^2 = 0.91$ when a combination of Ansari and Xiao mechanistic
models is utilized. The method for pressure drop prediction is also validated
on three real field cases. Validation indicates that the proposed model yields
the following coefficients of determination: $R^2 = 0.806, 0.815$ and 0.99 as
compared with the highest values obtained by commonly used techniques: $R^2 =

eigenvectors of associated matrices. Much of spectral graph theory descends
directly from spectral geometry, the study of differentiable manifolds through
the spectra of associated differential operators. But the translation from
spectral geometry to spectral graph theory has largely focused on results
involving only a few extreme eigenvalues and their associated eigenvalues.
Unlike in geometry, the study of graphs through the overall distribution of
eigenvalues - the spectral density - is largely limited to simple random graph
models. The interior of the spectrum of real-world graphs remains largely
unexplored, difficult to compute and to interpret.
  In this paper, we delve into the heart of spectral densities of real-world
graphs. We borrow tools developed in condensed matter physics, and add novel
adaptations to handle the spectral signatures of common graph motifs. The
resulting methods are highly efficient, as we illustrate by computing spectral
densities for graphs with over a billion edges on a single compute node. Beyond
providing visually compelling fingerprints of graphs, we show how the
estimation of spectral densities facilitates the computation of many common
centrality measures, and use spectral densities to estimate meaningful
information about graph structure that cannot be inferred from the extremal
eigenpairs alone.

the decay of the probability of `four-arm events' for the field conditioned to
have a saddle point at the origin. For some fields, including the important

coronal magnetic flux tubes (loops) for which no solution to the steady-state
fluid equations exists. The plasma is constantly evolving even though the
heating that produces the hot temperatures does not. This is a promising
explanation for isolated phenomena such as prominences, coronal rain, and
long-period pulsating loops, but it may also have much broader relevance. As
known for some time, TNE requires that the heating be both (quasi) steady and
concentrated at low coronal altitudes. Recent studies indicate that asymmetries
are also important, with large enough asymmetries in the heating and/or
cross-sectional area resulting in steady flow rather than TNE. Using reasonable
approximations, we have derived two formulae for quantifying the conditions
necessary for TNE. As a rough rule of thumb, the ratio of apex to footpoint
heating rates must be less than about 0.1, and asymmetries must be less than
about a factor of 3. The precise values are case dependent. We have tested our
formulae with 1D hydrodynamic loop simulations and find a very acceptable
agreement. These results are important for developing physical insight about
TNE and assessing how widespread it may be on the Sun.

energy gaps of the composite structure when parameters of the honeycomb and

of the arrays overlap with topological or nontopological gaps in the spectrum
of the other array. This is in contrast to conventional edge states at the
interface of periodic topological and uniform trivial insulators, whose

The number of emerging interface states is determined by the difference of the
Chern numbers of the overlapping gaps. Illustrative examples with one or two
coexisting unidirectional interface states are provided. The representative
feature of the system is the possibility of wide tuning of the concentration of
power of the interface states between two limiting cases when practically all

dramatic changes in viscosity when sheared, producing fascinating behaviors
that captivate children and rheologists alike. Recent examination of these
mixtures in simple flow geometries suggests inter-granular repulsion is central
to this effect --- for mixtures at rest or shearing slowly, repulsion prevents
frictional contacts from forming between particles, whereas, when sheared more
forcefully, granular stresses overcome the repulsion allowing particles to
interact frictionally and form microscopic structures that resist flow.
Previous constitutive studies of these mixtures have focused on particular
cases, typically limited to two-dimensional, steady, simple shearing flows. In
this work, we introduce a predictive and general, three-dimensional continuum
model for this material, using mixture theory to couple the fluid and particle
phases. Playing a central role in the model, we introduce a micro-structural
state variable, whose evolution is deduced from small-scale physical arguments
and checked with existing data. Our space- and time-dependent model is
implemented numerically in a variety of unsteady, non-uniform flow
configurations where it is shown to accurately capture a variety of key
behaviors: (i) the continuous shear thickening (CST) and discontinuous shear
thickening (DST) behavior observed in steady flows, (ii) the time-dependent
propagation of `shear jamming fronts', (iii) the time-dependent propagation of
`impact activated jamming fronts', and (iv) the non-Newtonian, `running on
oobleck' effect wherein fast locomotors stay afloat while slow ones sink.

to enforce permutation-invariance, but this comes at a greater computational
cost. To reduce this burden, we propose two key components: (i) a more
efficient approximate set kernel which is still positive-definite and is an
unbiased estimator of the true set kernel with upper-bounded variance in terms
of the number of subsamples, (ii) a constrained acquisition function
optimization over sets, which uses symmetry of the feasible region that defines
a set input. Finally, we present several numerical experiments which

that the dips produce a shape similar to that in binary systems with partial

operating inside a polygonal enclosure (possibly with holes), that have to
perform some collaborative tasks. The boundary of the polygon obstructs both
visibility and mobility of a robot. Since the polygon is initially unknown to
the robots, the natural approach is to first explore and construct a map of the
polygon. For this, the robots need an unlimited amount of persistent memory to
store the snapshots taken from different points inside the polygon. However, it
has been shown by Di Luna et al. [DISC 2017] that map construction can be done
even by oblivious robots by employing a positional encoding strategy where a
robot carefully positions itself inside the polygon to encode information in
the binary representation of its distance from the closest polygon vertex. Of
course, to execute this strategy, it is crucial for the robots to make accurate
movements. In this paper, we address the question whether this technique can be
implemented even when the movements of the robots are unpredictable in the
sense that the robot can be stopped by the adversary during its movement before
reaching its destination. However, there exists a constant $\delta > 0$,
unknown to the robot, such that the robot can always reach its destination if
it has to move by no more than $\delta$ amount. This model is known in
literature as \emph{non-rigid} movement. We give a partial answer to the
question in the affirmative by presenting a map construction algorithm for
robots with non-rigid movement, but having $O(1)$ bits of persistent memory and
ability to make circular moves.

better generalization of deep neural networks (DNNs); hence it is widely used
in tasks based on DNNs. During training, dropout randomly discards a portion of
the neurons to avoid overfitting. This paper presents an enhanced dropout
technique, which we call multi-sample dropout, for both accelerating training
and improving generalization over the original dropout. The original dropout
creates a randomly selected subset (called a dropout sample) from the input in
each training iteration while the multi-sample dropout creates multiple dropout
samples. The loss is calculated for each sample, and then the sample losses are
averaged to obtain the final loss. This technique can be easily implemented by
duplicating a part of the network after the dropout layer while sharing the
weights among the duplicated fully connected layers. Experimental results using
image classification tasks including ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 showed
that multi-sample dropout accelerates training. Moreover, the networks trained
using multi-sample dropout achieved lower error rates compared to networks
trained with the original dropout. The additional computation cost due to the
duplicated operations is not significant for deep convolutional networks
because most of the computation time is consumed in the convolution layers
before the dropout layer, which are not duplicated.

by two layers: 1) a physical layer of the population that is influenced by and
2) a virtual layer of group leaders. The model of negotiation and survival of
group leaders are governed by the nature-inspired evolutionary process of queen
ants, also known as Foundress Dilemma. The motivation of using a virtual
grouping concept (instead of taking a subset of population as the group
leaders) is to stay focused on finding the conditions leading individuals in a
society tolerating a significantly diversified (desegregated) neighborhood,
rather than, indulging into complex details, which would be more relevant to
studies targeting the evolution of societal group and leaders. A geographic
information system-driven simulation is performed, which reveals that: 1)
desegregation is directly proportional to the frequency of group leaders'
contact with the population and 2) mostly, it remains ineffective with an
increase in the intensity of group leaders' contact with the population. The
mechanism of group selection (the conflict resolution model resolving the
Foundress Dilemma) reveals an exciting result concerning negative influence of
cooperative group leaders. Most of the time, desegregation decreases with
increase in cooperative leaders (the leaders enforcing desegregation) when
compared with fierce leaders (the leaders enforcing segregation).

we introduce SpaceGAN, a novel generative model for geospatial domains that
learns neighbourhood structures through spatial conditioning. We propose to
enhance spatial representation beyond mere spatial coordinates, by conditioning
each data point on feature vectors of its spatial neighbours, thus allowing for
a more flexible representation of the spatial structure. To overcome issues of
training convergence, we employ a metric capturing the loss in local spatial
autocorrelation between real and generated data as stopping criterion for
SpaceGAN parametrization. This way, we ensure that the generator produces
synthetic samples faithful to the spatial patterns observed in the input.
SpaceGAN is successfully applied for data augmentation and outperforms compared
to other methods of synthetic spatial data generation. Finally, we propose an
ensemble learning framework for the geospatial domain, taking augmented
SpaceGAN samples as training data for a set of ensemble learners. We
empirically show the superiority of this approach over conventional ensemble
learning approaches and rivaling spatial data augmentation methods, using
synthetic and real-world prediction tasks. Our findings suggest that SpaceGAN
can be used as a tool for (1) artificially inflating sparse geospatial data and

either textures or shapes, such as style-transferred version of clean data,
saturated images and patch-shuffled ones, and then evaluate the classification

over the networks parameters, the main loss function generally only depends on
the realization of the neural network, i.e. the function it computes. Studying
the optimization problem over the space of realizations opens up new ways to
understand neural network training. In particular, usual loss functions like
mean squared error and categorical cross entropy are convex on spaces of neural
network realizations, which themselves are non-convex. Approximation
capabilities of neural networks can be used to deal with the latter

different, possibly degenerate, parametrizations. In particular, a local
minimum in the parametrization space needs not correspond to a local minimum in
the realization space. To establish such a connection, inverse stability of the
realization map is required, meaning that proximity of realizations must imply
proximity of corresponding parametrizations. We present pathologies which
prevent inverse stability in general, and, for shallow networks, proceed to
establish a restricted space of parametrizations on which we have inverse
stability w.r.t. to a Sobolev norm. Furthermore, we show that by optimizing
over such restricted sets, it is still possible to learn any function which can

processes and external factors, such as photoevaporation. Disentangling these
two effects, however, has remained difficult. We measure the dust masses of a
sample of 132 disks in the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC)-2 region, and compare
them to (i) externally photoevaporated disks in the Trapezium cluster, and (ii)
disks in nearby low-mass star forming regions (SFRs). This allows us to test if
initial disk properties are the same in high- and low-mass SFRs, and enables a
direct measurement of the effect of external photoevaporation on disks. A ~
$20' \times 4'$ mosaic of 3 mm continuum observations from the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) was used to measure the fluxes of 132
disks and 35 protostars >0.5 pc away from the Trapezium. We identify and
characterize a sample of 34 point sources not included in the Spitzer catalog
on which the sample is based. Of the disks, 37 (28%) are detected, with masses
ranging from 7-270 M_e. The detection rate for protostars is higher at 69%.
Disks near the Trapezium are found to be less massive by a factor
$0.18^{+0.18}_{-0.11}$, implying a mass loss rate of $8\times10^{-8}$ M_sun/yr.
Our observations allow us to distinguish the impact of time and environment on
disk evolution in a single SFR. The disk mass distribution in OMC-2 is
statistically indistinguishable from that in nearby low-mass SFRs, like Lupus
and Taurus. We conclude that age is the main factor determining the evolution
of these disks. This result is robust with respect to assumptions of dust
temperature, sample incompleteness and biases. The difference between the OMC-2
and Trapezium cluster samples is consistent with mass loss driven by
far-ultraviolet radiation near the Trapezium. Together, this implies that in
isolation, disk formation and evolution proceed similarly, regardless of cloud
mass.

on the organization of the stress fibers by altering the length scale at which
these are confined. This feedback mechanism is controlled by a dimensionless

quantum device functions with real-time feedback to guide the improved

demonstrate the recent development of atomic scale manipulation. Especially,
the review focuses on the progress that address the quantum properties by
design through the precise control of the atomic structures in several
technologically relevant materials systems. Besides conventional STM
manipulations and electronic structure characterization with single-probe STM,
integration of multiple atomically precisely controlled probes in a multiprobe
STM system vastly extends the capability of in situ characterization to a new
dimension where the charge and spin transport behaviors can be examined from
mesoscopic to atomic length scale. The automation of the atomic scale
manipulation and the integration with the well-established lithographic
processes would further push this bottom-up approach to a new level that
combines reproducible fabrication, extraordinary programmability, and the
ability to produce large-scale arrays of quantum structures.

generate a lightweight, low-polygonal mesh with clear face textures and sharp

this, we firstly partition the input mesh with plane primitives, simplify it
into a lightweight mesh next, then optimize plane parameters, camera poses and
texture colors to maximize the photometric consistency across frames, and
finally optimize mesh geometry to maximize consistency between geometry and
planes. Compared to existing planar reconstruction methods which only cover
large planar regions in the scene, our method builds the entire scene by
adaptive planes without losing geometry details and preserves sharp features in
the final mesh. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it
onto several RGB-D scans and comparing it to other state-of-the-art

compactified on an $S^1/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold, in which the fermions and gauge
bosons live in the bulk of the fifth dimension, offer one of the most
compelling mechanisms for addressing both the hierarchy problem and the flavor
puzzle of the Standard Model. However, the five-dimensional mass terms of bulk
fermions must be odd functions on the orbifold, and as such they should be
described by a field depending on the coordinate of the extra dimension. We
demonstrate the feasibility of dynamically generating these fermion bulk masses
with a bulk scalar field in warped extra dimensions. The bulk scalar acquires a
vacuum expectation value, which is odd under the orbifold symmetry and gives
rise to the fermion bulk masses through non-universal Yukawa-like interactions.
Like in the conventional Randall-Sundrum setup, the localization of the
different fermion zero modes along the extra dimension naturally explains the
observed flavor structure and four-dimensional mass hierarchy of the SM
fermions. We study the phenomenological implications of the backreaction on the
metric and the modified fermion profiles due to the bulk scalar field on
electroweak precision and flavor observables. Using up-to-date data, we show
that the contributions to the $S$, $T$, and $\epsilon_K$ parameters require the
mass of the first Kaluza-Klein gluon resonance to be of order 14 and 10 TeV in
the minimal and the custodial model, respectively, regardless of the effect of
the backreaction. Furthermore, effective flavor-changing interactions among the
SM fermions induced by the bulk scalar are discussed. We also comment on the
potential impact of the Higgs portal interaction of the bulk scalar on the
couplings of the Higgs boson.

and dust geometries. We have characterised the spectral energy distribution
(SED) of M33 from UV to sub-mm wavelengths, at a spatial scale of 100 pc. We
constructed input maps of the various stellar and dust geometries for use in
the RT modelling. By modifying our dust mix (fewer very small carbon grains and
a lower silicate-to-carbon ratio as compared to the Milky Way), we can much
better fit the sub-mm dust continuum. Using this new dust composition, we find
that we are able to well reproduce the observed SED of M33 using our adopted
model. In terms of stellar attenuation by dust, we find a reasonably strong,
broad UV bump, as well as significant systematic differences in the amount of
dust attenuation when compared to standard SED modelling. We also find
discrepancies in the residuals of the spiral arms versus the diffuse
interstellar medium (ISM), indicating a difference in properties between these
two regimes. The dust emission is dominated by heating due to the young stellar
populations at all wavelengths ($\sim$80% at 10 $\mu$m to $\sim$50% at 1 mm).

stochastic star formation, HII region and supernova feedback, and chemical
post-processing at 8 pc resolution. Our simulation shows excellent agreement

star formation tracer emission too strongly associated with molecular gas
tracer emission, inconsistent with observations. This result implies that the

the Auriga simulations commonly host phase space structures in the stellar
component that have constant orbital energies and arise from accreted
subhaloes. These structures can persist for a few Gyrs, even after coherent
streams in position space have been erased. We also explore velocity two-point
correlation functions and find this diagnostic is not deterministic for
particular clustering patterns in phase space. Finally, we explore these
structure diagnostics with the Aurigaia catalogues and show that the current
catalogues have the ability to recover some structures in phase space but
careful consideration is required to separate physical structures from
numerical structures arising from catalogue generation methods.

  Schedulers",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-user schedulers are designed to achieve optimal average system utility
(e.g. throughput) subject to a set of fairness criteria. In this work,
scheduling under temporal fairness constraints is considered. Prior works have
shown that a class of scheduling strategies called threshold based strategies
(TBSs) achieve optimal system utility under temporal fairness constraints. The
optimal TBS thresholds are determined as a function of the channel statistics.
In order to provide performance guarantees for TBSs in practical scenarios ---
where the scheduler learns the optimal thresholds based on the empirical
observations of the channel realizations --- it is necessary to evaluate the
rates of convergence of TBS thresholds to the optimal value. In this work,
these rates of convergence and the effect on the resulting system utility are
investigated. It is shown that the best estimate of the threshold vector is at
least $\omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}})$ away from the optimal value, where $t$ is
the number of observations of the independent and identically distributed
channel realizations. Furthermore, it is shown that under long-term fairness
constraints, the scheduler may achieve an average utility that is higher than
the optimal long-term utility by violating the fairness criteria for a long
initial period. Consequently, the resulting system utility may converge to its
optimal long-term value from above. The results are verified by providing
simulations of practical scheduling scenarios.

offered by metasurfaces are enabled by the use of passive, tunable radiating
elements. While these metamaterial elements do not exhibit the full range of
phase tuning as can be obtained with phase shifters, they can be engineered to
provide a similar level of performance with much lower power requirements and

larger metasurface apertures can be susceptible to strong grating lobes which
result from an unwanted periodic magnitude response that accompanies an ideal
phase pattern. In this work, we combine antenna theory with analytical modeling
of metamaterial elements to mathematically reveal the source of such grating
lobes. To circumvent this problem, we introduce a compensatory waveguide feed
layer designed to suppress grating lobes in metasurface antennas. The waveguide
feed layer helps metasurface antennas approach the performance of phased arrays
from an improved hardware platform, poising metasurface antennas to impact a

real-time Analytics require the ability to dynamically refresh query results
under high update rates. Traditional approaches to this problem are based
either on the materialization of subresults (to avoid their recomputation) or
on the recomputation of subresults (to avoid the space overhead of
materialization). Both techniques have recently been shown suboptimal: instead
of materializing results and subresults, one can maintain a data structure that
supports efficient maintenance under updates and can quickly enumerate the full
query output, as well as the changes produced under single updates.
Unfortunately, these data structures have been developed only for
aggregate-join queries composed of equi-joins, limiting their applicability in
domains such as CER where temporal joins are commonplace. In this paper, we
present a new approach for dynamically evaluating queries with multi-way
theta-joins under updates that is effective in avoiding both materialization
and recomputation of results, while supporting a wide range of applications. To
do this we generalize Dynamic Yannakakis, an algorithm for dynamically
processing acyclic equi-join queries. In tandem, and of independent interest,
we generalize the notions of acyclicity and free-connexity to arbitrary
theta-joins and show how to compute corresponding join trees. We instantiate
our framework to the case where theta-joins are only composed of equalities and
inequalities and experimentally compare our algorithm to state of the art CER
systems as well as incremental view maintenance engines. Our approach performs
consistently better than the competitor systems with up to two orders of
magnitude improvements in both time and memory consumption.

Waveguide tapering, in particular with increasing width, is determined to have

pumping simultaneously with both quasitransverse electric (TE) and

edge pre-cut specimens were determined. Normal tensile strengths of all
vulcanizates were similar. At the relatively slow strain rate experienced
wholesale by normal uncut specimens, all vulcanizates, prior to crack
initiation, strain-crystallized sufficiently to be strong. However, pre-cut
specimens experience increased strain rate at a cut tip. Magnification of the
strain rate increases as cut depth c increases. Fracture in the gum NR and
vulcanizates with up to 14 phr of black occurred by simple forward crack growth
from a cut tip, and all exhibited a critical cut size, above which strength
dropped abruptly. Furthermore, for these lightly filled samples, strength and
critical cut size decreased with increased black content. This indicates less
strain-crystalliation before rupture of pre-cut specimens, when levels of black
are low. This effect is attributerd to rapid straining at a cut tip and
hindering of the chain mobility necessary for crystallization. When black
content was increased to 15 phr, with 1 mm<c<2 mm, about 50% of specimens
retained simple lateral fracture and were weak, but the other 50% developed
deviated cracks (knotty tearing) and were significantly stronger than
corresponding pre-cut gum specimens, especially at large c. High strength with
sufficient black levels are attributed to increased strain-crystallization and
super-blunting (multiple cracks) at a cut tip. These inhibit forward crack
growth. For carbon black to enhance strain-crystallization relative to the gum,
it appears there must be enough of it to form a bound rubber/black network. If
the black concentration is less than this percolation threshold,
strain-crystallization is hindered at a cut tip.

energy, where no corresponding absorption feature is present. Our results

is to efficiently sample from multimodal distributions. Due to metastability,
multimodal distributions are difficult to sample using standard Markov chain

mechanism to accelerate the mixing of Langevin diffusion. Our algorithm is
motivated by its mean field partial differential equation (PDE), which is a
Fokker-Planck equation supplemented by a nonlocal birth-death term. This PDE
can be viewed as a gradient flow of the Kullback-Leibler divergence with

when applied to Electronic Medical Records (EMR) introduce additional barriers
to transparency because of the sequential processing of the RNN and the

introducing Learned Binary Masks (LBM) as a method for identifying which EMR
variables contributed to an RNN model's risk of mortality (ROM) predictions for
critically ill children; and 2) applying KernelSHAP for the same purpose. Given
an individual patient, LBM and KernelSHAP both generate an attribution matrix
that shows the contribution of each input feature to the RNN's sequence of
predictions for that patient. Attribution matrices can be aggregated in many
ways to facilitate different levels of analysis of the RNN model and its

volatile time periods within individual patient predictions, 2) over
populations of ICU patients sharing specific diagnoses, and 3) across the

of scenarios, from settings where the adversary has complete knowledge of the

particularly threatening as the adversary only needs access to the input and
output of the model. Defending against black box adversarial example generation
attacks is paramount as currently proposed defenses are not effective. Since
these types of attacks rely on repeated queries to the model to estimate
gradients over input dimensions, we investigate the use of randomization to
thwart such adversaries from successfully creating adversarial examples.
Randomization applied to the output of the deep neural network model has the
potential to confuse potential attackers, however this introduces a tradeoff
between accuracy and robustness. We show that for certain types of
randomization, we can bound the probability of introducing errors by carefully
setting distributional parameters. For the particular case of finite difference
black box attacks, we quantify the error introduced by the defense in the
finite difference estimate of the gradient. Lastly, we show empirically that
the defense can thwart two adaptive black box adversarial attack algorithms.

exploits the near-resonance between the direct energy gap of SnSe2 and the

there is a large number of MTDs to choose from for transmission at each time

It is proven that, for each beamformer, an MTD exists such that the

each of three different objectives, and that enforcing tighter constraints
improves the quality and increases the diversity of the generated images. On
the ChEMBL molecular dataset, our method generates a diverse set of new

broken inversion symmetry and strong spin-orbit coupling from the iridate

external magnetic field. Using the Monte Carlo technique and a two-orbital

we obtain phase diagrams which reveal at low temperatures a clear SkX phase and
also a low-field spin-spiral phase. Increasing temperature, a skyrmion-gas

(GAN) and Auto-Encoders (AE), are among the most popular neural network models

produces synthetic data and of a discriminator that discriminates between the
generator's output and the true data. AE consist of an encoder which maps the
model distribution to a latent manifold and of a decoder which maps the latent
manifold to a reconstructed distribution. However, generative models are known
to provoke chaotically scattered reconstructed distribution during their

Current distance measures fail to address this problem because they are not
able to acknowledge the shape of the data manifold, i.e. its topological
features, and the scale at which the manifold should be analyzed. We propose
Persistent Homology for Generative Models, PHom-GeM, a new methodology to

an objective function between the true and the reconstructed distributions and
uses persistent homology, the study of the topological features of a space at

homology for Wasserstein GAN in comparison to Wasserstein AE and Variational
AE. The experiments are conducted on a real-world data set particularly

Intuitively, blockwise adaptivity is less aggressive than adaptivity to

additional vehicle miles traveled, adding congestion and pollution into the
road network and the environment. This paper aims to employ a Markov Decision
Process (MDP) to model idle e-hailing drivers' optimal sequential decisions in
passenger-seeking. Transportation network companies (TNC) or e-hailing (e.g.,
Didi, Uber) drivers exhibit different behaviors from traditional taxi drivers
because e-hailing drivers do not need to actually search for passengers.
Instead, they reposition themselves so that the matching platform can match a
passenger. Accordingly, we incorporate e-hailing drivers' new features into our
MDP model. The reward function used in the MDP model is uncovered by leveraging
an inverse reinforcement learning technique. We then use 44,160 Didi drivers'
3-day trajectories to train the model. To validate the effectiveness of the
model, a Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to simulate the performance of
drivers under the guidance of the optimal policy, which is then compared with
the performance of drivers following one baseline heuristic, namely, the local
hotspot strategy. The results show that our model is able to achieve a 17.5%
improvement over the local hotspot strategy in terms of the rate of return. The
proposed MDP model captures the supply-demand ratio considering the fact that
the number of drivers in this study is sufficiently large and thus the number
of unmatched orders is assumed to be negligible. To better incorporate the
competition among multiple drivers into the model, we have also devised and
calibrated a dynamic adjustment strategy of the order matching probability.

nucleation of structures must be significantly slower than their growth.
However, details of the mechanism that impedes nucleation are broadly

structures employing mathematical modeling. We investigate two key scenarios to
delay nucleation: (i) by introducing a slow activation step for the assembling
constituents and, (ii) by decreasing the dimerization rate. These scenarios
have widely different characteristics. While the dimerization scenario exhibits
robust behavior, the activation scenario is highly sensitive to demographic
fluctuations. These demographic fluctuations ultimately disfavor growth
compared to nucleation and can suppress yield completely. The occurrence of
this stochastic yield catastrophe does not depend on model details but is
generic as soon as number fluctuations between constituents are taken into
account. On a broader perspective, our results reveal that stochasticity is an
important limiting factor for self-assembly and that the specific
implementation of the nucleation process plays a significant role in
determining the yield.

the most probable temporal behaviours of the model through most probable

in many sensing, imaging and communication applications. Such materials play an
important role as polarizers, filters and wave-plates in photonic devices and
circuits. Conventional crystalline materials with optical anisotropy typically
show unidirectional linear dichroism over a broad wavelength range. The linear
dichroism conversion phenomenon has not been observed in crystalline materials.
Here, we report the investigation of the unique linear dichroism conversion
phenomenon in quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) hexagonal perovskite
chalcogenide BaTiS3. The material shows record level of optical anisotropy
within the visible wavelength range. In contrast to conventional anisotropic
optical materials, the linear dichroism polarity in BaTiS3 makes an orthogonal
change at an optical wavelength corresponding to the photon energy of 1.78 eV.
First principle calculations reveal that this anomalous linear dichroism
conversion behavior originates from different selection rules of the optical
transitions from the parallel bands in the BaTiS3 material. Wavelength
dependent polarized Raman spectroscopy further confirms this phenomenon. Such
material with linear dichroism conversion property can facilitate new ability
to control and sense the energy and polarization of light, and lead to novel
photonic devices such as polarization-wavelength selective detectors and lasers
for multispectral imaging, sensing and optical communication applications.

problem, for which the input data vary over time and the solution is a
trajectory rather than a single point. To understand the complexity of finding
a global solution of this problem, we introduce the notion of \textit{spurious
(i.e., non-global) local trajectory} as a generalization to the notion of
spurious local solution in nonconvex (time-invariant) optimization. We develop
an ordinary differential equation (ODE) associated with a time-varying
nonlinear dynamical system which, at limit, characterizes the spurious local
solutions of the time-varying optimization problem. We prove that the absence
of spurious local trajectory is closely related to the transient behavior of
the developed system. In particular, we show that if the problem is
time-varying, the data variation may force all of the ODE trajectories
initialized at arbitrary local minima at the initial time to gradually converge
to the global solution trajectory. We study the Jacobian of the dynamical
system along a local minimum trajectory and show how its eigenvalues are
manipulated by the natural data variation in the problem, which may
consequently trigger escaping poor local minima over time.

facilitated by mapped RGB and depth information acquired by RGB-D cameras based

is to determine the relative poses of all cameras via a process known as
extrinsic calibration. In this work, we propose a sensor fusion framework based
on a weighted bi-objective optimization for refinement of extrinsic calibration
tailored for RGB-D multi-view systems. The weighted bi-objective cost function,
which makes use of 2D information from RGB images and 3D information from depth
images, is analytically derived via the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method. The
weighting factor appears as a function of noise in 2D and 3D measurements and
takes into account the affect of residual errors on the optimization. We
propose an iterative scheme to estimate noise variances in 2D and 3D
measurements, for simultaneously computing the weighting factor together with
the camera poses. An extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the
proposed approach shows improved calibration performance as compared to
refinement schemes which use only 2D or 3D measurement information.

persona attributes (e.g., gender, ethnicity, political interest, location,
etc.) can be accurately inferred from the topics the user writes about or
engages with. Attribute and preference inferences have been widely used to
serve personalized recommendations, directed ads, and to enhance the user
experience in social networks. However, revealing a user's sensitive attributes
could represent a privacy threat to some individuals. Microtargeting
(e.g.,Cambridge Analytica scandal), surveillance, and discriminating ads are
examples of threats to user privacy caused by sensitive attribute inference. In
this paper, we propose Multifaceted privacy, a novel privacy model that aims to
obfuscate a user's sensitive attributes while publicly preserving the user's
public persona. To achieve multifaceted privacy, we build Aegis, a prototype
client-centric social network stream processing system that helps preserve
multifaceted privacy, and thus allowing social network users to freely express
their online personas without revealing their sensitive attributes of choice.
Aegis allows social network users to control which persona attributes should be
publicly revealed and which ones should be kept private. For this, Aegis
continuously suggests topics and hashtags to social network users to post in
order to obfuscate their sensitive attributes and hence confuse content-based
sensitive attribute inferences. The suggested topics are carefully chosen to
preserve the user's publicly revealed persona attributes while hiding their
private sensitive persona attributes. Our experiments show that adding as few
as 0 to 4 obfuscation posts (depending on how revealing the original post is)
successfully hides the user specified sensitive attributes without changing the

actual performance of previously selected candidates. Critically, performance
information is only available for candidates who were selected under some
previous selection policy.
  In this work we assume that due to legal requirements or voluntary
commitments, an organization wants to increase the presence of people from
disadvantaged socio-demographic groups among the selected candidates. Hence, we
seek to design an affirmative action or positive action policy. This policy has
two concurrent objectives: (i) to select candidates who, given what can be
learnt from historical data, are more likely to perform well, and (ii) to
select candidates in a way that increases the representation of disadvantaged
socio-demographic groups.
  Our motivating application is the design of university admission policies to
bachelor's degrees. We use a causal model as a framework to describe several
families of policies (changing component weights, giving bonuses, and enacting
quotas), and compare them both theoretically and through extensive
experimentation on a large real-world dataset containing thousands of
university applicants. Our paper is the first to place the problem of
affirmative-action policy design within the framework of algorithmic fairness.
Our empirical results indicate that simple policies could favor the admission

transforming task behaviors to adapt to new tasks zero-shot. The key to
achieving these challenges is representing the task being performed in such a
way that this task representation is itself transformable. We therefore draw
inspiration from functional programming and recent work in meta-learning to
propose a class of Homoiconic Meta-Mapping (HoMM) approaches that represent
data points and tasks in a shared latent space, and learn to infer
transformations of that space. HoMM approaches can be applied to any type of
machine learning task. We demonstrate the utility of this perspective by
exhibiting zero-shot remapping of behavior to adapt to new tasks.

DPMMs are generally used in clustering problems where the number of clusters is

applications. Several efficient algorithms to compute optimal policies have
been studied in the literature, including value iteration (VI) and policy
iteration. However, these do not scale well especially when the discount factor
for the infinite horizon discounted reward, $\lambda$, gets close to $1$. In
particular, the running time scales as $O \left( 1/(1-\lambda) \right)$ for
these algorithms. In this paper, our goal is to design new algorithms that
scale better than previous approaches when $\lambda$ approaches $1$. Our main
contribution is to present a connection between VI and gradient descent and
adapt the ideas of acceleration and momentum in convex optimization to design
faster algorithms for MDPs. We prove theoretical guarantees of a faster
convergence of our algorithms for the computation of the value function of a
policy, where the running times of our algorithms scale as $O \left(
1/\sqrt{1-\lambda} \right)$ for reversible MDP instances. The improvement is
quite analogous to Nesterov's acceleration and momentum in convex optimization.
We also provide a lower bound on the convergence properties of any first-order
algorithm for solving MDPs, presenting a family of MDPs instances for which no
algorithm can converge faster than VI when the number of iterations is smaller
than the number of states. We introduce a Safe Accelerated Value Iteration
(S-AVI), which alternates between accelerated updates and value iteration
updates. Our algorithm S-AVI is worst-case optimal and retains the theoretical
convergence properties of VI while exhibiting strong empirical performances,

  Learning Systems",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a new framework for mitigating biases in machine
learning systems. The problem of the existing mitigation approaches is that
they are model-oriented in the sense that they focus on tuning the training
algorithms to produce fair results, while overlooking the fact that the
training data can itself be the main reason for biased outcomes. Technically
speaking, two essential limitations can be found in such model-based
approaches: 1) the mitigation cannot be achieved without degrading the accuracy
of the machine learning models, and 2) when the data used for training are
largely biased, the training time automatically increases so as to find
suitable learning parameters that help produce fair results. To address these
shortcomings, we propose in this work a new framework that can largely mitigate
the biases and discriminations in machine learning systems while at the same
time enhancing the prediction accuracy of these systems. The proposed framework
is based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs), which are used
to generate new synthetic fair data with selective properties from the original
data. We also propose a framework for analyzing data biases, which is important
for understanding the amount and type of data that need to be synthetically
sampled and labeled for each population group. Experimental results show that
the proposed solution can efficiently mitigate different types of biases, while
at the same time enhancing the prediction accuracy of the underlying machine
learning model.

astrophysical black holes. The possibility that they are actually horizonless
ultracompact objects and then free from the information loss paradox can be
examined more closely with observational data. In this paper, we systematically
develop a thermal gas model of the 2-2-hole in quadratic gravity, as one step
further to look for more tractable models of black hole mimickers. Concrete
predictions for departures from black holes are made all the way down to the
high curvature interior. The simple form of matter further enables an explicit
study of the relation between geometry and thermodynamics. Within this unified
framework, we identify notably different behaviors at two limits. On one side
is the astrophysically large 2-2-hole, as characterized by a minuscule
deviation outside the would-be horizon and a highly squeezed interior along the
radial direction. Anomalous features of black hole thermodynamics emerge from
the ordinary gas. On the other side is the minimal 2-2-hole with an isotropic
and shrinking interior, which behaves more like a normal thermodynamic system.
This brings a new perspective to the related theoretical questions as well as
phenomenological implications.

of a complex biological system from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In
recent years, Markov State Models have gained immense popularity for computing
state-to-state dynamics from a pool of short MD simulations. However, the
assumption that the underlying dynamics on the reduced space is Markovian
induces a systematic bias in the model, especially in biomolecular systems with
complicated energy landscapes. To address this problem, we have devised a new
approach we call quasi-stationary distribution kinetic Monte Carlo (QSD-KMC)
that gives accurate long time state-to-state evolution while retaining the
entire time resolution even when the dynamics is highly non-Markovian. The
proposed method is a kinetic Monte Carlo approach that takes advantage of two
concepts: (i) the quasi-stationary distribution and (ii) dynamical corrections
theory. Implementation of QSD-KMC imposes stricter requirements on the lengths
of the trajectories than in a Markov State Model approach, as the trajectories
must be long enough to dephase. However, the QSD-KMC model produces
state-to-state trajectories that are statistically indistinguishable from an MD
trajectory mapped onto the discrete set of states, for an arbitrary choice of
state decomposition. Furthermore, the aforementioned concepts can be used to
construct a Monte Carlo approach to optimize the state boundaries regardless of
the initial choice of states. We demonstrate the QSD-KMC method on two
one-dimensional model systems, one of which is a driven nonequilibrium system,
and on two well-characterized biomolecular systems.

the system and a meter and a subsequent read-out of the meter state that does
not involve any further interactions with the system. In the interval between
these two stages, the system and the meter are in an entangled state that
encodes all possible effects of the read-out in the form of non-local quantum
correlations between the system and the meter. Here, we show that the
entanglement generated in the system-meter interaction expresses a fundamental
relation between the amount of decoherence and the conditional probabilities
that describe the resolution of the measurement. Specifically, the entanglement
generated by the measurement interaction correlates both the target observable
and the back-action effects on the system with sets of non-commuting physical
properties in the meter. The choice of read-out in the meter determines the
trade-off between irreversible decoherence and measurement information by
steering the system into a corresponding set of conditional output states. The
Hilbert space algebra of entanglement ensures that the irreversible part of the
decoherence is exactly equal to the Hellinger distance describing the
resolution achieved in the measurement. We can thus demonstrate that the
trade-off between measurement resolution and back-action is a fundamental
property of the entanglement generated in measurement interactions.

we train multiple state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN) structures to
learn how to decode convolutional codes allowing a clear benchmarking with the
corresponding maximum likelihood (ML) Viterbi decoder. We examine the decoding
performance for various kinds of NN architectures, beginning with classical
types like feedforward layers and gated recurrent unit (GRU)-layers, up to more
recently introduced architectures such as temporal convolutional networks
(TCNs) and differentiable neural computers (DNCs) with external memory. As a
key limitation, it turns out that the training complexity increases
exponentially with the length of the encoding memory $\nu$ and, thus,
practically limits the achievable bit error rate (BER) performance. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce a new training-method by gradually increasing the
number of ones within the training sequences, i.e., we constrain the amount of
possible training sequences in the beginning until first convergence. By
consecutively adding more and more possible sequences to the training set, we
finally achieve training success in cases that did not converge before via
naive training. Further, we show that our network can learn to jointly detect

signature information to set appropriate hashed timelock contracts. The space
complexity of the protocol (i.e., the total number of bits written in the
blockchains in a swap) is O(|A|^2). The local time complexity of the protocol

probabilistic reasoning and inference in graphical models. While it is known to
be exact on trees, in most applications belief propagation is run on graphs
with cycles. Understanding the behavior of ""loopy"" belief propagation has been
a major challenge for researchers in machine learning, and positive convergence
results for BP are known under strong assumptions which imply the underlying
graphical model exhibits decay of correlations. We show that under a natural
initialization, BP converges quickly to the global optimum of the Bethe free
energy for Ising models on arbitrary graphs, as long as the Ising model is
\emph{ferromagnetic} (i.e. neighbors prefer to be aligned). This holds even
though such models can exhibit long range correlations and may have multiple
suboptimal BP fixed points. We also show an analogous result for iterating the
(naive) mean-field equations; perhaps surprisingly, both results are
dimension-free in the sense that a constant number of iterations already
provides a good estimate to the Bethe/mean-field free energy.

parametrized post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ from photons with left- and
right-handed circular polarizations should differ slightly, leading to the
arrival-time difference of these two circular components. Thus, the
polarization vector of a linearly polarized light may rotate during the
propagation. The rotation angle of the polarization vector depends on both the
photon energy and the distance of the source. It is believed that if the
rotation angle differs by more than $\pi/2$ over an energy range, then the net
polarization of the signal would be significantly suppressed and could not be
as high as the observed level. Thus, the detection of highly polarized photons
implies that the relative rotation angle ($\Delta\Theta$) should not be too
large. In this paper, we give a detailed calculation on the evolution of
gamma-ray burst (GRB) polarization arising from a possible violation of the
WEP, and we find that more than $60\%$ of the initial polarization degree can
be conserved even if $\Delta\Theta$ is larger than $\pi/2$. In addition, to
tightly constrain the WEP violation, GRBs with harder spectra and polarization
observations in a wider energy range seem to be favored. Applying our formulas
to the measurements of linear polarization from GRB 110721A and GRB 061122, we
obtain strict limits on the differences of the $\gamma$ values as low as
$\Delta\gamma<1.3\times10^{-33}$ and $\Delta\gamma<0.8\times10^{-33}$. These
provide the most stringent limits to date on a deviation from the WEP,
improving at least 6 orders of magnitude over previous bounds.

a technique that combines queue-bounded exploration with a convergence test: if
the sequence of certain abstractions of the reachable states, for increasing
queue bounds k, converges, we can prove any property of the program that is
preserved by the abstraction. If the abstract state space is finite,
convergence is guaranteed; the challenge is to catch the point k_max where it
happens. We further demonstrate how simple invariants formulated over the
concrete domain can be used to eliminate spurious abstract states, which
otherwise prevent the sequence from converging. We have implemented our
technique for the P programming language for event-driven programs. We show
experimentally that the sequence of abstractions often converges fully
automatically, in hard cases with minimal designer support in the form of
sequentially provable invariants, and that this happens for a value of k_max
small enough to allow the method to succeed in practice.

suffers from several drawbacks: 1) Conventional GP inference scales $O(N^{3})$
with respect to the number of observations; 2) Updating a GP model sequentially
is not trivial; and 3) Covariance kernels typically enforce stationarity

are often intractable to use in practice. To overcome these issues, we propose
a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to fit infinite mixtures of GPs that capture

distinguishes different brain and non-brain tissues based on image intensities
and prior tissue probability maps (TPM). This works well for normal head
anatomies, but fails in the presence of unexpected lesions. Deep convolutional
neural networks leverage instead spatial patterns and can learn to segment
lesions, but often ignore prior probabilities. Approach: We add three sources
of prior information to a three-dimensional convolutional network, namely,
spatial priors with a TPM, morphological priors with conditional random fields,
and spatial context with a wider field-of-view at lower resolution. We train
and test these networks on 3D images of 43 stroke patients and 4 healthy
individuals which have been manually segmented. Results: We demonstrate the
benefits of each sources of prior information, and we show that the new
architecture, which we call Multiprior network, improves the performance of
existing segmentation software, such as SPM, FSL, and DeepMedic for abnormal
anatomies. The relevance of the different priors was compared and the TPM was
found to be most beneficial. The benefit of adding a TPM is generic in that it
can boost the performance of established segmentation networks such as the
DeepMedic and a UNet. We also provide an out-of-sample validation and clinical
application of the approach on an additional 47 patients with disorders of
consciousness. We make the code and trained networks freely available.
Conclusions: Biomedical images follow imaging protocols that can be leveraged
as prior information into deep convolutional neural networks to improve
performance. The network segmentations match human manual corrections performed

learning. Compared with a widely studied task -- classification, generally
speaking, object detection even need one or two orders of magnitude more FLOPs
(floating point operations) in processing the inference task. To enable a
practical application, it is essential to explore effective runtime and
accuracy trade-off scheme. Recently, a growing number of studies are intended
for object detection on resource constraint devices, such as YOLOv1, YOLOv2,
SSD, MobileNetv2-SSDLite, whose accuracy on COCO test-dev detection results are
yield to mAP around 22-25% (mAP-20-tier). On the contrary, very few studies
discuss the computation and accuracy trade-off scheme for mAP-30-tier detection
networks. In this paper, we illustrate the insights of why RetinaNet gives
effective computation and accuracy trade-off for object detection and how to
build a light-weight RetinaNet. We propose to only reduce FLOPs in
computational intensive layers and keep other layer the same. Compared with
most common way -- input image scaling for FLOPs-accuracy trade-off, the
proposed solution shows a constantly better FLOPs-mAP trade-off line.
Quantitatively, the proposed method result in 0.1% mAP improvement at 1.15x
FLOPs reduction and 0.3% mAP improvement at 1.8x FLOPs reduction.

  the selection and crossover algorithm",,,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work examines the expected computational cost to determine an
approximate global minimum of a class of cost functions characterized by the
variance of coefficients. The cost function takes $N$-dimensional binary states
as arguments and has many local minima. Iterations in the order of $2^N$ are
required to determine an approximate global minimum using random search. This
work analytically and numerically demonstrates that the selection and crossover
algorithm with random initialization can reduce the required computational cost
(i.e., number of iterations) for identifying an approximate global minimum to
the order of $\lambda^N$ with $\lambda$ less than 2. The two best solutions,
referred to as parents, are selected from a pool of randomly sampled states.
Offspring generated by crossovers of the parents' states are distributed with a
mean cost lower than that of the original distribution that generated the
parents. It is revealed that in contrast to the mean, the variance of the cost
of the offspring is asymptotically the same as that of the original
distribution. Consequently, sampling from the offspring's distribution leads to
a higher chance of determining an approximate global minimum than sampling from
the original distribution, thereby accelerating the global search. This feature
is distinct from the distribution obtained by a mixture of a large population
of favorable states, which leads to a lower variance of offspring. These
findings demonstrate the advantage of the crossover between two favorable
states over a mixture of many favorable states for an efficient determination
of an approximate global minimum.

conventional graphs. Parallel coordinates are proposed as an alternative to
explore multivariate data more effectively. However, it is difficult to extract
relevant information through the parallel coordinates when the data are
high-dimensional with thousands of lines overlapping. The order of the axes
determines the perception of information on parallel coordinates. Thus, the
information between attributes remain hidden if coordinates are improperly
ordered. Here we propose a general framework to reorder the coordinates. This
framework is general to cover a large range of data visualization objective. It
is also flexible to contain many conventional ordering measures. Consequently,
we present the coordinate ordering binary optimization problem and enhance
towards a computationally efficient greedy approach that suites
high-dimensional data. Our approach is applied on wine data and on genetic

samples, which indicate that the brain can transfer its prior knowledge to
solve tasks in different domains. This function is analogous to transfer
learning (TL) in the field of machine learning. TL uses a well-trained feature
space in a specific task domain to improve performance in new tasks with
insufficient training data. TL with rich feature representations, such as
features of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), shows high generalization
ability across different task domains. However, such TL is still insufficient
in making machine learning attain generalization ability comparable to that of
the human brain. To examine if the internal representation of the brain could
be used to achieve more efficient TL, we introduce a method for TL mediated by
human brains. Our method transforms feature representations of audiovisual
inputs in CNNs into those in activation patterns of individual brains via their
association learned ahead using measured brain responses. Then, to estimate
labels reflecting human cognition and behavior induced by the audiovisual
inputs, the transformed representations are used for TL. We demonstrate that
our brain-mediated TL (BTL) shows higher performance in the label estimation
than the standard TL. In addition, we illustrate that the estimations mediated
by different brains vary from brain to brain, and the variability reflects the
individual variability in perception. Thus, our BTL provides a framework to
improve the generalization ability of machine-learning feature representations
and enable machine learning to estimate human-like cognition and behavior,

Their masses, and hence their gravitational potentials, are negligible compared

SMBH masses and host galaxy properties have been observed, notably the
$M-\sigma$ relation connecting the SMBH mass to the characteristic velocity of
stars in the galaxy. The existence of these correlations implies that the SMBH
influences the evolution of its host galaxy. In this review, we present the
most promising physical model of this influence, known as the Active galactic

around the SMBH can drive powerful outflows, provided that the SMBH is massive
enough - this condition establishes the $M-\sigma$ relation. Outflows can have
a profound influence on the evolution of the host galaxy, by compressing its
gas and driving it out, affecting the star formation rate. We present the
current status of the model and the observational evidence for it, as well as

which aims to unveil the inherent content structure of a multi-paragraph
document by identifying its potential sections and generating the corresponding

novel structured summarization task. To generate a sound outline, an ideal OG
model should be able to capture three levels of coherence, namely the coherence
between context paragraphs, that between a section and its heading, and that
between context headings. The first one is the foundation for section
identification, while the latter two are critical for consistent heading
generation. In this work, we formulate the OG task as a hierarchical structured
prediction problem, i.e., to first predict a sequence of section boundaries and
then a sequence of section headings accordingly. We propose a novel
hierarchical structured neural generation model, named HiStGen, for the task.
Our model attempts to capture the three-level coherence via the following ways.
First, we introduce a Markov paragraph dependency mechanism between context
paragraphs for section identification. Second, we employ a section-aware
attention mechanism to ensure the semantic coherence between a section and its
heading. Finally, we leverage a Markov heading dependency mechanism and a
review mechanism between context headings to improve the consistency and
eliminate duplication between section headings. Besides, we build a novel
WIKIOG dataset, a public collection which consists of over 1.75 million
document-outline pairs for research on the OG task. Experimental results on our

several state-of-the-art sequential generation models for the OG task.

ground-based CO data, we then constructed CO spectral line energy distributions
(SLEDs) on 10 pc scales over a 60 pc x 60 pc area and found that the shape of

transition varies from J=6-5 to 10-9, while the slope characterized by the
high-to-intermediate J ratio ranges from 0.4 to 1.8. To examine the source(s)

scales, which could be produced by either UV photons (UV radiation field ~

processes (e.g., interaction between the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds)
are likely the dominant source of heating for CO. The shocked CO-bright medium

roadblocks that restrain us from using this data as such, first being the
storage which restricts us from only storing the information based on the
hardware constraints. Secondly, the computation required to process this data
is highly expensive which makes it infeasible to work on them. Compressive
sensing(CS)[2] is a signal process technique[11], through optimization, the
sparsity of a signal can be exploited to recover it from far fewer samples than
required by the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem. There are two conditions
under which recovery is possible. The first one is sparsity which requires the
signal to be sparse in some domain. The second one is incoherence which is
applied through the isometric property which is sufficient for sparse
signals[9][10]. To sustain these characteristics, preserving all attributes in
the uncompressed domain would help any kind of in this field. However, existing
dataset fallback in terms of continuous tracking of all the object present in

comprehensive video dataset, where the data is compressed using pixel-wise

the distinct spin-orbital states of the Ru2+ ions (in addition to the common
Ni+ S=1/2 state but with a different orbital state): the Ru2+ S=0 state in
LaSr3NiRuO4H4, but the Ru2+ S=1 state in LaSrNiRuO4. The Ru2+ S=0 state has the
(xy)2(xz; yz)4 occupation due to the RuH4O2 octahedral coordination, and then
the nonmagnetic Ru2+ ions dilute the S=1/2 Ni+ sublattice which consequently
has a very weak antiferromagnetic (AF) superexchange and thus accounts for no
presence of magnetic order down to 1.8 K in LaSr3NiRuO4H4. In strong contrast,
the Ru2+ S=1 state in LaSrNiRuO4 has the (3z2-r2)2(xz; yz)3(xy)1 occupation due
to the planar square RuO4 coordination, and then the multi-orbital FM
superexchange between the S=1/2 Ni+ and S=1 Ru2+ ions gives rise to the high TC
in LaSrNiRuO4. This work highlights the importance of spin-orbital states in
determining the distinct magnetism.

the appearance of an expression varies in poses. To alleviate the influences of
poses, recent methods either perform pose normalization or learn separate FER
classifiers for each pose. However, these methods usually have two stages and
rely on good performance of pose estimators. Different from existing methods,
we propose a pose-adaptive hierarchical attention network (PhaNet) that can
jointly recognize the facial expressions and poses in unconstrained

facial expression by an attention mechanism in hierarchical scales, and the
most informative scales are then selected to learn the pose-invariant and
expression-discriminative representations. PhaNet is end-to-end trainable by
minimizing the hierarchical attention losses, the FER loss and pose loss with
dynamically learned loss weights. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed
PhaNet on three multi-view datasets (BU-3DFE, Multi-pie, and KDEF) and two

text but keep its main content unchanged without parallel data. Most existing
methods typically follow two steps: first separating the content from the
original style, and then fusing the content with the desired style. However,
the separation in the first step is challenging because the content and style
interact in subtle ways in natural language. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose a dual reinforcement learning framework to directly transfer the style
of the text via a one-step mapping model, without any separation of content and
style. Specifically, we consider the learning of the source-to-target and
target-to-source mappings as a dual task, and two rewards are designed based on
such a dual structure to reflect the style accuracy and content preservation,
respectively. In this way, the two one-step mapping models can be trained via
reinforcement learning, without any use of parallel data. Automatic evaluations
show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art systems by a large margin,
especially with more than 8 BLEU points improvement averaged on two benchmark
datasets. Human evaluations also validate the effectiveness of our model in
terms of style accuracy, content preservation and fluency. Our code and data,

the app was evaluated in several school subjects. An evaluation of the

discourage certain user groups. For apps to have a higher chance to appeal to a

the most effective way to reach teenagers. Thus, this paper covers the
following research question. What customizations are necessary in Pocket Code
to reinforce female teenagers in their coding activities? To answer this

insights about our target group and suggested names and designs for the new

developed together with university design students. By showing female teenagers

ideas and inspiration to code their own programs.

Autoencoders (VRAE) for text generation suffers from serious uninformative
latent variables problem. The model would collapse into a plain language model
that totally ignore the latent variables and can only generate repeating and
dull samples. In this paper, we explore the reason behind this issue and
propose an effective regularizer based approach to address it. The proposed
method directly injects extra constraints on the posteriors of latent variables
into the learning process of VRAE, which can flexibly and stably control the
trade-off between the KL term and the reconstruction term, making the model
learn dense and meaningful latent representations. The experimental results
show that the proposed method outperforms several strong baselines and can make
the model learn interpretable latent variables and generate diverse meaningful
sentences. Furthermore, the proposed method can perform well without using
other strategies, such as KL annealing.

networks (CNNs). Our approach reduces the complexity of convolutions by
replacing it with binary decisions. Those binary decisions are used as indexes
to conditional distributions where each weight represents a leaf in a decision
tree. This means that only the indices to the weights need to be determined
once, thus reducing the complexity of convolutions by the depth of the output
tensor. Index computation is performed by simple binary decisions that require
fewer cycles compared to conventionally used multiplications. In addition, we
show how convolutions can be replaced by binary decisions. These binary
decisions form indices in the conditional distributions and we show how they
are used to replace 2D weight matrices as well as 3D weight tensors. These new
layers can be trained like convolution layers in CNNs based on the
backpropagation algorithm, for which we provide a formalization.
  Our results on multiple publicly available data sets show that our approach
performs similar to conventional neuronal networks. Beyond the formalized
reduction of complexity and the improved qualitative performance, we show the
runtime improvement empirically compared to convolution layers.

variants Eker{\aa}-H{\aa}stad and Mosca-Ekert). For a periodic function $f$
these algorithms produce -- via some quantum embedding of $f$ -- a quantum
superposition $\sum_x |x\rangle|f(x)\rangle$, which requires a certain amount
of output qubits that represent $|f(x)\rangle$. We show that one can lower this
amount to a single output qubit by hashing $f$ down to a single bit in an
oracle setting.
  Namely, we replace the embedding of $f$ in quantum period finding circuits by
oracle access to several embeddings of hashed versions of $f$. We show that on
expectation this modification only doubles the required amount of quantum
measurements, while significantly reducing the total number of qubits. For
example, for Simon's algorithm that finds periods in $f: \mathbb{F}_2^n
\rightarrow \mathbb{F}_2^n$ our hashing technique reduces the required output
qubits from $n$ down to $1$, and therefore the total amount of qubits from $2n$
to $n+1$. We also show that Simon's algorithm admits real world applications
with only $n+1$ qubits by giving a concrete realization of a hashed version of
the cryptographic Even-Mansour construction. Moreover, for a variant of Simon's
algorithm on Even-Mansour that requires only classical queries to Even-Mansour
we save a factor of (roughly) $4$ in the qubits.
  Our oracle-based hashed version of the Eker{\aa}-H{\aa}stad algorithm for
factoring $n$-bit RSA reduces the required qubits from $(\frac 3 2 + o(1))n$
down to $(\frac 1 2 + o(1))n$. We also show a real-world (non-oracle)
application in the discrete logarithm setting by giving a concrete realization
of a hashed version of Mosca-Ekert for the Decisional Diffie Hellman problem in
$\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$, thereby reducing the number of qubits by even a linear
factor from $m \log p$ downto $\log p$.

helpful in solving many problems. However, objective functions are usually
hand-crafted and designing a good one can be quite challenging. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework to learn the objective function based on a neural
net-work. The basic idea is to consider the neural network as an objective
function, and the input as an optimization variable. For the learning of
objective function from the training data, two processes are conducted: In the
inner process, the optimization variable (the input of the network) are
optimized to minimize the objective function (the network output), while fixing
the network weights. In the outer process, on the other hand, the weights are
optimized based on how close the final solution of the inner process is to the
desired solution. After learning the objective function, the solution for the
test set is obtained in the same manner of the inner process. The potential and
applicability of our approach are demonstrated by the experiments on toy

by reducing the desired link's power at the cost of degrading its bit error
ratio performance and assuming the power consumed to artificial noise (AN)
projection (ANP). We formulate the joint optimization problem of maximizing the
secrecy rate (Max-SR) over the transmit antenna selection and ANP in the
context of secure SM-aided networks, which is mathematically a non-linear mixed
integer programming problem. In order to solve this problem, we provide a pair
of solutions, namely joint and separate solutions. Specifically, an accurate
approximation of the SR is used for reducing the computational complexity, and
the optimal AN covariance matrix (ANCM) is found by convex optimization for any
given active antenna group (AAG). Then, given a large set of AAGs, simulated
annealing mechanism is invoked for optimizing the choice of AAG, where the
corresponding ANCM is recomputed by this optimization method as well when the
AAG changes. To further reduce the complexity of the above-mentioned joint
optimization, a low-complexity two-stage separate optimization method is also
proposed. Furthermore, when the number of transmit antennas tends to infinity,
the Max-SR problem becomes equivalent to that of maximizing the ratio of the
desired user's signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio to the eavesdropper's.
Thus our original problem reduces to a fractional programming problem, hence a
significant computational complexity reduction can be achieved for the
optimization problem. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithms
outperform the existing leakage-based null-space projection scheme in terms of
the SR performance attained, and drastically reduces the complexity at a slight
SR performance reduction.

event detection (SED) and a disentangled feature (DF) for the multi-label
problem in polyphonic SED are proposed. We approach SED as a multiple instance
learning (MIL) problem and utilize a neural network framework with a pooling
module to solve it. General MIL approaches include two kinds: the
instance-level approaches and embedding-level approaches. We present a method
of generating instance-level probabilities for the embedding level approaches
which tend to perform better than the instance-level approaches in terms of
bag-level classification but can not provide instance-level probabilities in
current approaches. Moreover, we further propose a specialized decision surface
(SDS) for the embedding-level attention pooling. We analyze and explained why
an embedding-level attention module with SDS is better than other typical
pooling modules from the perspective of the high-level feature space. As for
the problem of the unbalanced dataset and the co-occurrence of multiple
categories in the polyphonic event detection task, we propose a DF to reduce
interference among categories, which optimizes the high-level feature space by
disentangling it based on class-wise identifiable information and obtaining
multiple different subspaces. Experiments on the dataset of DCASE 2018 Task 4
show that the proposed SDS and DF significantly improve the detection
performance of the embedding-level MIL approach with an attention pooling
module and outperform the first place system in the challenge by 6.6 percentage
points.

problems, such as recommender systems, search ranking and online advertisement.
However, one of the challenges is data sparsity in learning large-scale item
embedding, as users' historical behavior data are usually lacking or
insufficient in an individual domain. In fact, user's behaviors from different
domains regarding the same items are usually relevant. Therefore, we can learn
complete user behaviors to alleviate the sparsity using complementary
information from correlated domains. It is intuitive to model users' behaviors
using graph, and graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently shown the great
power for representation learning, which can be used to learn item embedding.
However, it is challenging to transfer the information across domains and learn
cross-domain representation using the existing GNNs. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel model - Deep Multi-Graph

construct a multi-graph based on users' behaviors from different domains, and

Their simplified description in terms of a phase has been advocated by
different authors using distinct phase definitions in the stochastic case. One
notion of phase that we put forward previously, the \emph{asymptotic phase of a
stochastic oscillator}, is based on the eigenfunction expansion of its
probability density. More specifically, it is given by the complex argument of
the eigenfunction of the backward operator corresponding to the least negative
eigenvalue. Formally, besides the `backward' phase, one can also define the
`forward' phase as the complex argument of the eigenfunction of the forward
Kolomogorov operator corresponding to the least negative eigenvalue. Until now,
the intuition about these phase descriptions has been limited. Here we study
these definitions for a process that is analytically tractable, the
two-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with complex eigenvalues. For this
process, (i) we give explicit expressions for the two phases; (ii) we
demonstrate that the isochrons are always the spokes of a wheel, but that (iii)
the spacing of these isochrons (their angular density) is different for
backward and forward phases; (iv) we show that the isochrons of the backward
phase are completely determined by the deterministic part of the vector field,

demonstrate that the mean progression of the backward phase in time is always
uniform, whereas this is not true for the forward phase except in the
rotationally symmetric case. We illustrate our analytical results for a number

doomed by the curse of dimensionality. A popular approach to avoid this curse
is to project input measures on lower-dimensional subspaces (1D lines in the
case of sliced Wasserstein distances), solve the OT problem between these
reduced measures, and settle for the Wasserstein distance between these
reductions, rather than that between the original measures. This approach is
however difficult to extend to the case in which one wants to compute an OT map
(a Monge map) between the original measures. Since computations are carried out
on lower-dimensional projections, classical map estimation techniques can only
produce maps operating in these reduced dimensions. We propose in this work two
methods to extrapolate, from an transport map that is optimal on a subspace,
one that is nearly optimal in the entire space. We prove that the best optimal
transport plan that takes such ""subspace detours"" is a generalization of the
Knothe-Rosenblatt transport. We show that these plans can be explicitly
formulated when comparing Gaussian measures (between which the Wasserstein
distance is commonly referred to as the Bures or Fr\'echet distance). We
provide an algorithm to select optimal subspaces given pairs of Gaussian
measures, and study scenarios in which that mediating subspace can be selected
using prior information. We consider applications to semantic mediation between
elliptic word embeddings and domain adaptation with Gaussian mixture models.

which can be generated through high-gain parametric down-conversion or
four-wave mixing. Although BSV is an important tool in quantum optics and has a
lot of applications, its theoretical description is still not complete. In
particular, the existing description in terms of Schmidt modes fails to explain
the spectral broadening observed in experiment as the mean number of photons
increases. On the other hand, the semi-classical description accounting for the
broadening does not allow to decouple the intermodal photon-number
correlations. In this work, we present a new generalized theoretical approach
to describe the spatial properties of BSV. This approach is based on exchanging
the $(\textbf{k},t)$ and $(\omega,z)$ representations and solving a system of
integro-differential equations. Our approach predicts correctly the dynamics of
the Schmidt modes and the broadening of the spectrum with the increase in the
BSV mean photon number due to a stronger pumping. Moreover, the model
succesfully describes various properties of a widely used experimental
configuration with two crystals and an air gap between them, namely an SU(1,1)
interferometer. In particular, it predicts the narrowing of the intensity
distribution, the reduction and shift of the side lobes, and the decline in the
interference visibility as the mean photon number increases due to stronger
pumping. The presented experimental results confirm the validity of the new
approach. The model can be easily extended to the case of frequency spectrum,
frequency Schmidt modes and other experimental configurations.

autonomous drone racing which is computationally more efficient than navigation
methods like visual inertial odometry and simultaneous localization and
mapping. This fast light-weight vision-based navigation algorithm estimates the
position of the drone by fusing race gate detections with model dynamics
predictions. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show the clear
advantage compared to Kalman filtering when dealing with the relatively low
frequency visual updates and occasional large outliers that occur in fast drone
racing. Flight tests are performed on a tiny racing quadrotor named ""Trashcan"",
which was equipped with a Jevois smart-camera for a total of 72g. The test
track consists of 3 laps around a 4-gate racing track. The gates spaced 4
meters apart and can be displaced from their supposed position. An average
speed of 2m/s is achieved while the maximum speed is 2.6m/s. To the best of our
knowledge, this flying platform is the smallest autonomous racing drone in the
world and is 6 times lighter than the existing lightest autonomous racing drone
setup (420g), while still being one of the fastest autonomous racing drones in
the world.

function between two random variables, correntropy has been successfully
applied in robust machine learning and signal processing to combat large
outliers. The kernel function in correntropy is usually a zero-mean Gaussian
kernel. In a recent work, the concept of mixture correntropy (MC) was proposed
to improve the learning performance, where the kernel function is a mixture

present work, to further improve the learning performance, we propose the
concept of multi-kernel correntropy (MKC), in which each component of the
mixture Gaussian kernel can be centered at a different location. The properties
of the MKC are investigated and an efficient approach is proposed to determine

very important for autonomous cars, but most state-of-the-art approaches only
achieve high accuracy rates in optimal weather conditions. The reason is that
they are only optimized for good weather conditions and given noise models.
However, most of them fail, if data with unknown disturbances occur, and their
performance decrease enormously. One possibility to still obtain reliable
results is to observe the environment with different sensor types, such as
camera and lidar, and to fuse the sensor data by means of neural networks,
since different sensors behave differently in diverse weather conditions.
Hence, the sensors can complement each other by means of an appropriate sensor
data fusion. Nevertheless, the fusion-based approaches are still susceptible to
disturbances and fail to classify disturbed image areas correctly. This problem
can be solved by means of a special training method, the so called Robust
Learning Method (RLM), a method by which the neural network learns to handle
unknown noise. In this work, two different sensor fusion architectures for
semantic segmentation are compared and evaluated on several datasets.
Furthermore, it is shown that the RLM increases the robustness in adverse
weather conditions enormously, and achieve good results although no disturbance
model has been learned by the neural network.

connected by a gimbal, which is similar in structure to a control moment

compared to the traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), by encoding
and preserving spatial relationships between the detected features in a better
way. This is achieved through the so-called Capsules (i.e., groups of neurons)
that encode both the instantiation probability and the spatial information.
However, one of the major hurdles in the wide adoption of CapsNets is their
gigantic training time, which is primarily due to the relatively higher
complexity of their new constituting elements that are different from CNNs. In
this paper, we implement different optimizations in the training loop of the
CapsNets, and investigate how these optimizations affect their training speed
and the accuracy. Towards this, we propose a novel framework FasTrCaps that
integrates multiple lightweight optimizations and a novel learning rate policy
called WarmAdaBatch (that jointly performs warm restarts and adaptive batch

speedup at minimal accuracy loss. We also propose weight sharing for capsule

unused/redundant connections and capsules, while keeping high accuracy through
tests of different learning rate policies and batch sizes. We demonstrate that
one of the solutions generated by the FasTrCaps framework can achieve 58.6%
reduction in the training time, while preserving the accuracy (even 0.12%
accuracy improvement for the MNIST dataset), compared to the CapsNet by Google

  Outliers",,,,,"cs.DS cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Clustering has many important applications in computer science, but
real-world datasets often contain outliers. Moreover, the presence of outliers
can make the clustering problems to be much more challenging. To reduce the
complexities, various sampling methods have been proposed in past years.
Namely, we take a small sample (uniformly or non-uniformly) from input and run
an existing approximation algorithm on the sample. Comparing with existing
non-uniform sampling methods, the uniform sampling approach has several
significant benefits. For example, it only needs to read the data in one-pass
and is very easy to implement in practice. Thus, the effectiveness of uniform
sampling for clustering with outliers is a natural and fundamental problem
deserving to study in both theory and practice. In this paper, we propose a new
and unified framework for analyzing the effectiveness of uniform sampling for
three representative center-based clustering with outliers problems,
$k$-center/median/means clustering with outliers. We introduce a ""significance""
criterion and prove that the performance of uniform sampling depends on the
significance degree of the given instance. In particular, we show that the
sample size can be independent of the ratio $n/z$ and the dimensionality. More
importantly, to the best of our knowledge, our method is the first uniform
sampling approach that allows to discard exactly $z$ outliers for these three
center-based clustering with outliers problems. The results proposed in this
paper also can be viewed as an extension of the previous sub-linear time
algorithms for the ordinary clustering problems (without outliers). The
experiments suggest that the uniform sampling method can achieve comparable
clustering results with other existing methods, but greatly reduce the running
times.

in various fields, suffer from brittle training effects such as regression in

some of the brittleness stems from variance differences, i.e. when different
environment areas - states and/or actions - have different rewards variance.
This causes two problems: First, the ""Boring Areas Trap"" in algorithms such as
Q-learning, where moving between areas depends on the current area variance,
and getting out of a boring area is hard due to its low variance. Second, the
""Manipulative Consultant"" problem, when value-estimation functions used in DQN
and Actor-Critic algorithms influence the agent to prefer boring areas,
regardless of the mean rewards return, as they maximize estimation precision
rather than rewards. This sheds a new light on how exploration contribute to
training, as it helps with both challenges. Cognitive experiments in humans
showed that noised reward signals may paradoxically improve performance. We
explain this using the two mentioned problems, claiming that both humans and
algorithms may share similar challenges. Inspired by this result, we propose
the Adaptive Symmetric Reward Noising (ASRN), by which we mean adding Gaussian
noise to rewards according to their states' estimated variance, thus avoiding
the two problems while not affecting the environment's mean rewards behavior.
We conduct our experiments in a Multi Armed Bandit problem with variance
differences. We demonstrate that a Q-learning algorithm shows the brittleness
effect in this problem, and that the ASRN scheme can dramatically improve the
results. We show that ASRN helps a DQN algorithm training process reach better

plan paths anticipating multiple steps ahead. We prove that, similarly to PIBT,
all agents reach their own destinations in finite time as long as the
environment is a graph with adequate properties, e.g., biconnected.
Experimental results over various scenarios confirm that winPIBT mitigates
livelock situations occurring in PIBT, and usually plans more efficient paths
given adequate window size.

Generally, the distinctiveness is computed according to the absolute difference

the human visual system is highly sensitive to structural changes rather than
absolute difference. Accordingly, we propose the computation of the structural
dissimilarity between image patches as the distinctiveness measure for saliency
detection. Similar to IQA models, the structural dissimilarity is computed
based on the correlation of the structural features. The global structural
dissimilarity of a patch to all the other patches represents saliency of the
patch. We adopt two widely used structural features, namely the local contrast
and gradient magnitude, into the structural dissimilarity computation in the
proposed model. Without any postprocessing, the proposed model based on the
correlation of either of the two structural features outperforms 11
state-of-the-art saliency models on three saliency databases.

techniques are needed to facilitate tall towers that are low-weight and cost
effective, but in effect more flexible. Such soft-soft tower configurations
generally have their fundamental side-side frequency in the below-rated
operational domain. Because the turbine rotor practically has or develops a
mass imbalance over time, a periodic and rotor-speed dependent side-side
excitation is present during below-rated operation. Persistent operation at the
coinciding tower and rotational frequency degrades the expected structural life
span. To reduce this effect, earlier work has shown the effectiveness of active
tower damping control strategies using collective pitch control. A more passive
approach is frequency skipping by inclusion of speed exclusion zones, which
avoids prolonged operation near the critical frequency. However, neither of the
methods incorporate a convenient way of performing a trade-off between energy
maximization and fatigue load minimization. Therefore, this paper introduces a
quasi-linear parameter varying model predictive control (qLPV-MPC) scheme,
exploiting the beneficial (convex) properties of a qLPV system description. The
qLPV model is obtained by a demodulation transformation, and is subsequently
augmented with a simple wind turbine model. Results show the effectiveness of
the algorithm in synthetic and realistic simulations using the NREL 5-MW
reference wind turbine in high-fidelity simulation code. Prolonged rotor speed
operation at the tower side-side natural frequency is prevented, whereas when
the trade-off is in favor of energy production, the algorithm decides to
rapidly pass over the natural frequency to attain higher rotor speeds and power
productions.

negligible between both spin configurations. This suggests that self-absorption

  (Technical Report)","Technical report",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Process-aware Recommender systems (PAR systems) are information systems that
aim to monitor process executions, predict their outcome, and recommend
effective interventions to reduce the risk of failure. This paper discusses
monitoring, predicting, and recommending using a PAR system within a financial
institute in the Netherlands to avoid faulty executions. While predictions were
based on the analysis of historical data, the most opportune intervention was
selected on the basis of human judgment and subjective opinions. The results
showed that, while the predictions of risky cases were relatively accurate, no
reduction was observed in the number of faulty executions. We believe that this
was caused by incorrect choices of interventions. While a large body of
research exists on monitoring and predicting based on facts recorded in
historicaldata, research on fact-based interventions is relatively limited.
This paper reports on lessons learned from the case study in finance and
proposes a new methodology to improve the performances of PAR systems. This
methodology advocates the importance of several cycles of interactions among
all actors involved so as to develop interventions that incorporate their
feedback and are based on insights from factual, historical data.

the spectral and spatial signatures of each component in order to disentangle

performance of GMCA on X-ray data is tested using Monte-Carlo simulations of
supernova remnant toy models, designed to represent typical science cases. We
find that GMCA is able to separate highly entangled components in X-ray data

spectrum and map of each physical component. A modification is proposed to
improve the spectral fidelity in the case of strongly overlapping spatial
components, and we investigate a resampling method to derive realistic
uncertainties associated to the results of the algorithm. Applying the modified
algorithm to the deep Chandra observations of Cassiopeia A, we are able to

all recent algorithmic advances (e.g. neural nets, forests). We show that the
estimated effect model is robust to estimation errors in the auxiliary models,
by showing that the loss satisfies a Neyman orthogonality criterion. Our
approach can be used to estimate projections of the true effect model on
simpler hypothesis spaces. When these spaces are parametric, then the parameter

Orbital dynamics, simulations, and recent observations of proto-planetary disks
all suggest that the planet can stably orbit in a plane perpendicular to that
of an eccentric host binary star (i.e., a polar orbit). No solid claim of
detection of such a configuration has been made; the nine systems detected by
the transit technique are nearly coplanar, but their discovery is also biased
towards that configuration. Here, we develop Eclipse Timing Variations (ETVs)
as a method to detect misaligned CBPs. We find that since apsidal motion
(periastron precession) of the host binary is prograde for a coplanar planet
and retrograde for a polar planet, the mean eclipse period of primary and
secondary eclipses differ in a way that distinguishes those configurations.
Secondly, the Eclipse Duration Variations (EDVs) vary in a way that can confirm
that inference, over and against a polar model. Thirdly, the relative phasing
of primary and secondary ETVs on the planet's orbital timescale also
distinguishes the two configurations, which we explain analytically and
quantify through a grid of numerical models. We apply these methods to
Kepler-34, a transiting planet known to be nearly coplanar by detailed
photodynamic modeling. In this system, we find that the binary eclipse times
alone suffice to distinguish these orbital configurations, using the effects
introduced here. Our work provides a tool for discovering potential polar CBPs,
or misaligned CBPs of milder inclinations, from the existing ETV dataset of the
Kepler, as well as future observations by TESS or PLATO.

robust alternative to the more conventional BGK-LBM for the simulation of
high-Reynolds number flows. Unfortunately, its original formulation makes its
extension to a broader range of physics quite difficult. To tackle this issue,
a recent work [A. De Rosis, Phys. Rev. E 95, 013310 (2017)] proposed a more
generic way to derive concise and efficient three-dimensional CM-LBMs. Knowing
the original model also relies on central moments that are derived in an adhoc
manner, i.e., by mimicking those of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to
ensure their Galilean invariance a posteriori, a very recent effort [A. De
Rosis and K. H. Luo, Phys. Rev. E 99, 013301 (2019)] was proposed to further
generalize their derivation. The latter has shown that one could derive
Galilean invariant CMs in a systematic and a priori manner by taking into
account high-order Hermite polynomials in the derivation of the discrete
equilibrium state. Combining these two approaches, a compact and mathematically
sound formulation of the CM-LBM with external forcing is proposed. More
specifically, the proposed formalism fully takes advantage of the D3Q27
discretization by relying on the corresponding set of 27 Hermite polynomials
(up to the sixth order) for the derivation of both the discrete equilibrium
state and the forcing term. The present methodology is more consistent than
previous approaches, as it properly explains how to derive Galilean invariant
CMs of the forcing term in an a priori manner. Furthermore, while keeping the
numerical properties of the original CM-LBM, the present work leads to a
compact and simple algorithm, representing a universal methodology based on CMs
and external forcing within the lattice Boltzmann framework.

efficiency is the central factor that links stellar generations as it defines
both their stellar mass and the remaining mass available for further star
formation, fixing also the amount of matter required to contaminate the next
stellar generation. In this way, the star formation efficiency is here shown to
be fully defined by the He enhancement between successive stellar generations
in a GC.
  Our approach has also an impact on the evolution of clusters and thus
considers the possible loss of stars through evaporation, tidal interactions
and stellar evolution. We focus on the present mass ratio between consecutive
stellar generations and the present total mass of Galactic globular clusters.
Such considerations suffice to determine the relative proportion of stars of
consecutive generations that remain today in globular clusters. The latter is
also shown to directly depend on the values of Delta Y and thus the He

redshifts ($z$) of one and two on the expansion rate and growth of
perturbations. Using both Gaussian process regression and a parameteric model,
we show that this is the preferred solution to the current set of low-redshift
($z<3$) distance measurements if $H_0=73~\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$ to within
1\% and the high-redshift expansion history is unchanged from the $\Lambda$CDM
inference by the Planck satellite. Dark energy was effectively non-existent
around $z=2$, but its density is close to the $\Lambda$CDM model value today,
with an equation of state greater than $-1$ at $z<0.5$. If sources of
clustering other than matter are negligible, we show that this expansion
history leads to slower growth of perturbations at $z<1$, compared to
$\Lambda$CDM, that is measurable by upcoming surveys and can alleviate the
$\sigma_8$ tension between the Planck CMB temperature and low-redshift probes
of the large-scale structure.

simultaneously with the dynamical equations, which is best done with the

peculiar motion of the Sun with respect to the C$\nu$B rest frame and the
rotation of the Earth about its axis and can be observed in experiments with
both polarized and unpolarized nuclear targets. The main advantage of the
suggested method is that it does not depend crucially on the energy resolution
of detection of the produced $\beta$-particles and can be operative even if
this resolution exceeds the largest neutrino mass.

predict that sodium insertion is more favourable at vacancies than at

comparable to that of expert observers and very significantly better than that
of an a-priori bounding box segmentation. Our result gives a mean Jaccard
coefficient of 0.87, compared to mean scores of 0.85, 0.88 and 0.87 produced
from three independent manual annotations. This represents the first use of DMD
as a robust automatic data-driven segmentation approach without requiring any
human intervention. This is a viable, efficient alternative approach to current
manual methods of isolation of kidney function in DCE-MRI.

in the forefront of spintronic research. Here, we report an experimental
observation of the temperature dependent negative magnetoresistance in Bi2Te3
topological insulator (TI) nanowires at ultralow temperatures (20 mK). We find
a crossover from negative to positive magnetoresistance while increasing
temperature under longitudinal magnetic field. We observe a large negative
magnetoresistance which reaches -22% at 8T. The interplay between negative and
positive magnetoresistance can be understood in terms of the competition
between dephasing and spin-orbit scattering time scales. Based on the
first-principles calculations within a density functional theory framework, we
demonstrate that disorder (substitutional) by Ga+ ion milling process, which is
used to fabricate nanowires, induces local magnetic moments in Bi2Te3 crystal
that can lead to spin-dependent scattering of surface and bulk electrons. These
experimental findings show a significant advance in the nanoscale spintronics
applications based on longitudinal magnetoresistance in TIs. Our experimental
results of large negative longitudinal magnetoresistance in 3D TIs further
indicate that axial anomaly is a universal phenomenon in generic 3D metals.

Previous schemes are improved to facilitate implementation. In particular, when
$n$ is odd and equals $2k+1$, we describe a quantum error correction scheme
using one arbitrary qubit $\sigma$ to protect the data state $\rho$ in a
$2k$-qubit system. The encoding operation $\sigma \otimes \rho \mapsto
\Phi(\sigma \otimes \rho)$ only requires $3k$ CNOT gates (each with one control
bit and one target bit). After the encoded state $\Phi(\sigma\otimes \rho)$
goes through the channel, we can apply the inverse operation $\Phi^{-1}$ to
produce $\tilde \sigma \otimes \rho$ so that a partial trace operation can
recover $\rho$. When $n$ is even and equals $2k+2$, we describe a hybrid
quantum error correction scheme using any one of the two classical bits $\sigma
\in \{|ij\rangle \langle ij|: i, j \in \{0,1\}\}$ to protect a $2k$-qubit state
$\rho$ and 2 classical bits. The encoding operation $\sigma \otimes \rho

single quibt Hadamard gate. After the encoded state $\Phi(\sigma\otimes \rho)$
goes through the channel, we can apply the inverse operation $\Phi^{-1}$ to
produce $\sigma \otimes \rho$ so that a perfect protection of the two classical
bits $\sigma$ and the $2k$-qubit state is achieved. If one uses an arbitrary
$2$-qubit state $\sigma$, the same scheme will protect $2k$-qubit states. The
scheme was implemented using Matlab, Mathematica, Python, and the IBM's quantum

when we are only given a start and an end frame. This task is also known as
inbetweening, and it belongs to the broader area of stochastic video
generation, which is generally approached by means of recurrent neural networks
(RNN). In this paper, we propose instead a fully convolutional model to
generate video sequences directly in the pixel domain. We first obtain a latent
video representation using a stochastic fusion mechanism that learns how to
incorporate information from the start and end frames. Our model learns to
produce such latent representation by progressively increasing the temporal
resolution, and then decode in the spatiotemporal domain using 3D convolutions.
The model is trained end-to-end by minimizing an adversarial loss. Experiments
on several widely-used benchmark datasets show that it is able to generate
meaningful and diverse in-between video sequences, according to both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

stable over long times (hours) near both filling factors, indicating stability
of the fermion parity. At both fractions, when phase fluctuations are observed,

change or change in the number of the enclosed $e/4$ quasiparticles. We also
examine lower-frequency oscillations attributable to Abelian interference

Several groups are found to have peculiar kinematics: the NGC 1977 cluster and

been caused by a global hierarchical cloud collapse, feedback by massive Ori
OB1ab stars, supersonic turbulence, cloud-cloud collision, and/or slingshot
effect; the former two models are favored by us. EON groups might have
inherited anomalous motions of their parental cloudlets due to small-scale
`rocket effects' from nearby OB stars. We also identify sparse stellar groups
to the east and west of Orion A that are drifting from the central region,
possibly a slowly expanding halo of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We confirm
previously reported findings of varying line-of-sight distances to different

trusted components can tolerate a greater proportion of faults, but require
that every replica have this hardware.
  We present SACZyzzyva, addressing these concerns: resilience to slow replicas
and requiring only $3f + 1$ replicas, with only one replica needing an active
monotonic counter at any given time.
  We experimentally evaluate our protocols, demonstrating low latency and high
scalability. We prove that SACZyzzyva is optimally robust and that trusted
components cannot increase fault tolerance unless they are present in greater
than two-thirds of replicas.

low-energy nuclear recoils and a high event rate tolerance are stringent
requirements to measure CE$\nu$NS of reactor antineutrinos. A new experimental
site, denoted the Very-Near-Site (VNS) at the Chooz nuclear power plant in

flows up the conduit, so that fluid fragmentation and nucleation of density
inhomogeneities occur; therefore, changing temperature can trigger a transition
between the ""magma-dissolved gas"" fluid and magmatic foam phases. This phase

parameters than samples, often generalize well. An attempt of understanding
this puzzle is to discover implicit biases underlying the training process of
DNNs, such as the Frequency Principle (F-Principle), i.e., DNNs often fit
target functions from low to high frequencies. Inspired by the F-Principle, we
propose an effective model of linear F-Principle (LFP) dynamics which
accurately predicts the learning results of two-layer ReLU neural networks
(NNs) of large widths. This LFP dynamics is rationalized by a linearized mean
field residual dynamics of NNs. Importantly, the long-time limit solution of
this LFP dynamics is equivalent to the solution of a constrained optimization
problem explicitly minimizing an FP-norm, in which higher frequencies of
feasible solutions are more heavily penalized. Using this optimization
formulation, an a priori estimate of the generalization error bound is
provided, revealing that a higher FP-norm of the target function increases the
generalization error. Overall, by explicitizing the implicit bias of the
F-Principle as an explicit penalty for two-layer NNs, our work makes a step
towards a quantitative understanding of the learning and generalization of
general DNNs.

we consider a model of evolutionary dynamics with game transitions, where
individuals' behaviors together with the games they play in one time step
influence the games to be played next time step. Within this model, we study
the evolution of cooperation in structured populations and find a simple rule:
weak selection favors cooperation over defection if the ratio of the benefit
provided by an altruistic behavior, $b$, to the corresponding cost, $c$,
exceeds $k-k'$, where $k$ is the average number of neighbors of an individual
and $k'$ captures the effects of the game transitions. Even if cooperation
cannot be favored in each individual game, allowing for a transition to a
relatively valuable game after mutual cooperation and to a less valuable game
after defection can result in a favorable outcome for cooperation. In
particular, small variations in different games being played can promote
cooperation markedly. Our results suggest that simple game transitions can
serve as a mechanism for supporting prosocial behaviors in highly-connected

development of sophisticated autoscaling policies that allow automatic

autoscaling policies for workflows are mostly plan-based or designed for
batches (ensembles) of workflows. This reduces their flexibility when dealing
with workloads of workflows, as the workloads are often subject to
unpredictable resource demand fluctuations. Moreover, autoscaling in clouds
almost always imposes budget constraints that should be satisfied. The
budget-aware autoscalers for workflows usually require task runtime estimates
to be provided beforehand, which is not always possible when dealing with
workloads due to their dynamic nature. To address these issues, we propose a
novel Performance-Feedback Autoscaler (PFA) that is budget-aware and does not
require task runtime estimates for its operation. Instead, it uses the
performance-feedback loop that monitors the average throughput on each resource
type. We implement PFA in the popular Apache Airflow workflow management

Mixed Integer Programming approach. Our results show that PFA outperforms other

flows, play a crucial role in many geo- and astrophysical settings. In
turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection, for example, horizontally extended
coherent large-scale convection rolls emerge. Currently, a detailed
understanding of the interplay of small-scale turbulent fluctuations and
large-scale coherent structures is missing. Here, we investigate the resolved
kinetic energy and temperature variance budgets by applying a filtering
approach to direct numerical simulations of Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection at
high aspect ratio. In particular, we focus on the energy transfer rate between
large-scale flow structures and small-scale fluctuations. We show that the
small scales primarily act as a dissipation for the superstructures. However,
we find that the height-dependent energy transfer rate has a complex structure
with distinct bulk and boundary layer features. Additionally, we observe that
the heat transfer between scales mainly occurs close to the thermal boundary
layer. Our results clarify the interplay of superstructures and turbulent
fluctuations and may help to guide the development of an effective description
of large-scale flow features in terms of reduced-order models.

electromagnetic waves is revealed. It is shown that for every helical
evanescent wave on a helicity-dependent half tangent line in momentum space,
the orientation of each of its field, spin, and Poynting vectors is the same.
This geometric structure reveals itself as a remarkable relation between the
far-field and near-field components of the angular spectrum. Any general
evanescent wavevector is linked to two points on the $k_{\rho}=k_0$ circle of
propagating wavevectors via two helicity-dependent tangent lines. Knowing the
field on the $k_{\rho}=k_0$ circle of a general dipolar source is sufficient to
determine its entire evanescent angular spectrum. Applying this concept, we
gain insights into near-field directionality by showing that every zero in the
angular spectrum is a helicity singularity where two half-tangent lines of
opposite helicity intersect. A powerful method for synthetic design of
near-field directional sources is also devised, using structured helical
illumination to gain full control of the near-field directionality. The results
provide a fundamental insight of helical evanescent waves and have implications
in areas where chiral light-matter interaction plays a central role.

theory that provides a new perspective for a better understanding of networked

among nodes with respect to the whole network architecture. Considering the
statistics of geodesic distances, information parity detects how similar a pair
of nodes can influence and be influenced by the network. This allows us to
quantify the quality of information gathered by the nodes. To demonstrate the
method's potential, we evaluate a social network and human brain networks. Our
results indicate that emerging phenomena like an ideological orientation of
nodes in a social network is severely influenced by their information parities.
We also show that anatomical brain networks have a greater information parity
in inter-hemispheric correspondent regions placed near the sagittal plane.
Finally, functional networks have, on average, greater information parity for
inter-hemispheric correspondent regions in comparison to the whole network. We
find that a pair of regions with high information parity exhibits higher
correlation, suggesting that the functional correlations between cortical
regions can be partially explained by the symmetry of their overall influences

come to a forefront in recent years, in both the security community and the
privacy community. However, one big limitation of previous research is that the
security domain and the privacy domain have typically been considered
separately. It is thus unclear whether the defense methods in one domain will
have any unexpected impact on the other domain.
  In this paper, we take a step towards resolving this limitation by combining
the two domains. In particular, we measure the success of membership inference
attacks against six state-of-the-art defense methods that mitigate the risk of
adversarial examples (i.e., evasion attacks). Membership inference attacks
determine whether or not an individual data record has been part of a model's
training set. The accuracy of such attacks reflects the information leakage of
training algorithms about individual members of the training set. Adversarial
defense methods against adversarial examples influence the model's decision
boundaries such that model predictions remain unchanged for a small area around
each input. However, this objective is optimized on training data. Thus,
individual data records in the training set have a significant influence on
robust models. This makes the models more vulnerable to inference attacks.
  To perform the membership inference attacks, we leverage the existing
inference methods that exploit model predictions. We also propose two new
inference methods that exploit structural properties of robust models on
adversarially perturbed data. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that
compared with the natural training (undefended) approach, adversarial defense
methods can indeed increase the target model's risk against membership
inference attacks.

labelled examples relating to a specific task, such that it can generalize to

Usually a model learns task-specific information from a small training-set
(support-set) to predict on an unlabelled validation set (target-set). The
target-set contains additional task-specific information which is not utilized
by existing few-shot learning methods. Making use of the target-set examples
via transductive learning requires approaches beyond the current methods; at
inference time, the target-set contains only unlabelled input data-points, and
so discriminative learning cannot be used. In this paper, we propose a
framework called Self-Critique and Adapt or SCA, which learns to learn a
label-free loss function, parameterized as a neural network. A base-model
learns on a support-set using existing methods (e.g. stochastic gradient
descent combined with the cross-entropy loss), and then is updated for the
incoming target-task using the learnt loss function. This label-free loss
function is itself optimized such that the learnt model achieves higher

substantially reduced error-rates compared to baselines which only adapt on the

efficient plug-in estimator of a pathwise differentiable parameter in a
statistical model that at minimal (and possibly only) assumes that the
sectional variation norm of the true nuisance functional parameters (i.e., the
relevant part of data distribution) are finite. It relies on an initial
estimator (HAL-MLE) of the nuisance functional parameters by minimizing the
empirical risk over the parameter space under the constraint that the sectional
variation norm of the candidate functions are bounded by a constant, where this
constant can be selected with cross-validation. In this article, we establish
that the nonparametric bootstrap for the HAL-TMLE, fixing the value of the
sectional variation norm at a value larger or equal than the cross-validation
selector, provides a consistent method for estimating the normal limit
distribution of the HAL-TMLE.
  In order to optimize the finite sample coverage of the nonparametric
bootstrap confidence intervals, we propose a selection method for this
sectional variation norm that is based on running the nonparametric bootstrap
for all values of the sectional variation norm larger than the one selected by
cross-validation, and subsequently determining a value at which the width of
the resulting confidence intervals reaches a plateau.
  We demonstrate our method for 1) nonparametric estimation of the average
treatment effect based on observing on each unit a covariate vector, binary
treatment, and outcome, and for 2) nonparametric estimation of the integral of
the square of the multivariate density of the data distribution. In addition,
we also present simulation results for these two examples demonstrating the
excellent finite sample coverage of bootstrap-based confidence intervals.

contrast to the self-trapped hole polarons by lattice distortions in other
wide-band-gap oxides that reduce the hole mobility, holes in rutile GeO$_2$ are
delocalized due to their small effective mass. The first allowed optical
transitions at $\Gamma$ occur at 5.04 eV ($\vec{E} \perp \vec{c}$) and 6.65 eV

which decomposes a tensor as a sum of rank-one tensors. However, the

approximation in the Wasserstein distance by Last, Peccati and Schulte (2016).
As an application of this Poisson limit theorem, we consider a stationary
Poisson point process in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and connect any two points whenever
their distance is less than or equal to a prescribed distance parameter. This
construction gives rise to the well known random geometric graph. The number of
edges of this graph is counted that have a midpoint in the $d$-dimensional unit
ball. A quantitative Poisson limit theorem for this counting statistic is
derived, as the space dimension $d$ and the intensity of the Poisson point
process tend to infinity simultaneously, showing that the phase transition
phenomenon holds also in the high-dimensional set-up.

adopting the array multiplier architecture. The multipliers are synthesized in

asynchronous multiplier utilizing the biased weak-indication full adder is
found to be efficient in terms of the cycle time and the power-cycle time

cellular system with free space optical (FSO) backhauling. MmWave channels are
subject to Nakagami-m fading while the optical links experience the Double
Generalized Gamma including atmospheric turbulence, path loss and the
misalignment between the transmitter and the receiver aperture (also known as
the pointing errors). The FSO model also takes into account the receiver
detection technique which could be either heterodyne or intensity modulation
and direct detection (IM/DD). Each user equipment (UE) has to be associated to
one serving base station (BS) based on the received signal strength (RSS) or
Channel State Information (CSI). We assume partial relay selection (PRS) with
CSI based on mmWaves channels to select the BS associated with the highest
received CSI. Each serving BS decodes the received signal for denoising,
converts it into modulated FSO signal, and then forwards it to the data center.
Thereby, each BS can be viewed as a decode-and-forward (DF) relay. In practice,
the relay hardware suffers from nonlinear high power amplification (HPA)
impairments which, substantially degrade the system performance. In this work,
we will discuss the impacts of three common HPA impairments named respectively,
soft envelope limiter (SEL), traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA), and solid
state power amplifier (SSPA). Novel closed-forms and tight upper bounds of the
outage probability, the probability of error, and the achievable rate are

undergoes periodic oscillations in space, returning to the initial position
after one oscillation cycle. This wave phenomenon, known as Bloch oscillations
(BOs), pertains to many physical systems. Can BOs also occur in topological
insulators with topologically protected edge states? This question is highly
nontrivial, because in topological insulators with broken time-reversal
symmetry, the edge states propagate unidirectionally without backscattering,
hence BOs that typically involve stages, where wavepacket moves along and
against the direction of the force, seem to be impossible in such systems when
force acts parallel to the edge of the insulator. Here we reveal that BOs still
occur with topological edge states, but in a nonconventional way: they are
accompanied not only by oscillations along the edge in the direction of force,
but also by oscillations in the direction transverse to that of the force. Full
BO cycle involves switching between edge states at the opposite edges through
delocalized bulk modes. Bloch oscillations of the topological edge states
require to scan the first Brillouin zone twice to complete one cycle, thus they
have a period that is two times larger than the period of usual BOs. All these
unusual properties are in contrast to BOs in non-topological systems.

cellular-to-air (C2A) channel model incorporates line-of-sight (LoS) and
non-LoS transmissions between terrestrial-BSs and a typical aerial user, while
we assume LoS transmissions for all aerial links. We assume that the aerial
user is associated with an aerial-BS or terrestrial-BS that provides the
strongest average received power. Using stochastic geometry, we derive exact
and approximate expressions of the coverage probability and rate in terms of
interference power's Laplace transform. The expressions are simplified assuming
only LoS transmissions for the C2A channels. This enables easy-to-compute
equations with good accuracy at elevated aerial user heights. We find that
aerial users hovering at low altitudes tend to connect to aerial-BSs in denser
terrestrial environments. Employing directive beamforming at aerial-BSs
guarantees an acceptable performance at the aerial user by reducing
interference signals received from the aerial-BSs. In denser terrestrial
networks, the performance at the aerial user degrades substantially despite

perform an agent-based simulation of SAEVs across the Rouen Normandie
metropolitan area in France. The simulation process features impact assessment
by considering dynamic demand responsive to the network and traffic. Research
results suggest that the performance of SAEVs is strongly correlated to the
charging infrastructure. Importantly, faster charging infrastructure and
optimized placement of charging locations in order to minimize distances
between demand hubs and charging stations result in a higher performance.
Further analysis indicates the importance of dispersing charging stations
across the service area and how this affects service effectiveness. The results
also underline that SAEV battery capacity has to be carefully selected to avoid
the overlaps between demand and charging peak times. Finally, the simulation
results show that by providing battery swapping infrastructure the performance
indicators of SAEV service are significantly improved.

multidimensional arrays, are among the most general and powerful tools for
scientific analysis. However, because of their increasing size, today's data
sets require more complex tensor decomposition involving factorization with
multiple matrices and diagonal tensors such as DEDICOM or PARATUCK2.
Traditional tensor resolution algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD), Non-linear Conjugate Gradient descent (NCG) or Alternating Least Square
(ALS), cannot be easily applied to complex tensor decomposition or often lead
to poor accuracy at convergence. We propose a new resolution algorithm, called
VecHGrad, for accurate and efficient stochastic resolution over all existing
tensor decomposition, specifically designed for complex decomposition. VecHGrad
relies on gradient, Hessian-vector product and adaptive line search to ensure
the convergence during optimization. Our experiments on five real-world data
sets with the state-of-the-art deep learning gradient optimization models show
that VecHGrad is capable of converging considerably faster because of its
superior theoretical convergence rate per step. Therefore, VecHGrad targets as
well deep learning optimizer algorithms. The experiments are performed for
various tensor decomposition including CP, DEDICOM and PARATUCK2. Although it
involves a slightly more complex update rule, VecHGrad's runtime is similar in
practice to that of gradient methods such as SGD, Adam or RMSProp.

computer game emulator capable of human level performance. In a reinforcement
learning approach, an optimal value function is learned across a set of
actions, or decisions, that leads to a set of states giving different rewards,
with the objective to maximize the overall reward. A policy assigns to each
state-action pairs an expected return. We call an optimal policy a policy for
which the value function is optimal. QLBS, Q-Learner in the
Black-Scholes(-Merton) Worlds, applies the reinforcement learning concepts, and
noticeably, the popular Q-learning algorithm, to the financial stochastic model
of Black, Scholes and Merton. It is, however, specifically optimized for the
geometric Brownian motion and the vanilla options. Its range of application is,
therefore, limited to vanilla option pricing within financial markets. We

learning approach that determines the optimal policy of money management based
on the aggregated financial transactions of the clients. It unlocks new
frontiers to establish personalized credit card limits or to fulfill bank loan

simulation to mean reverting stochastic diffusion processes and it uses a
digital function, a Heaviside step function expressed in its discrete form, to
estimate the probability of a future event such as a payment default. In our

customers by tailoring services to individuals. In order to achieve this,
businesses must be able to make personalized predictions regarding the next
purchase. That is, one must forecast the exact list of items that will comprise
the next purchase, i.e., the so-called market basket. Despite its relevance to
firm operations, this problem has received surprisingly little attention in
prior research, largely due to its inherent complexity. In fact,
state-of-the-art approaches are limited to intuitive decision rules for pattern
extraction. However, the simplicity of the pre-coded rules impedes performance,
since decision rules operate in an autoregressive fashion: the rules can only
make inferences from past purchases of a single customer without taking into
account the knowledge transfer that takes place between customers. In contrast,
our research overcomes the limitations of pre-set rules by contributing a novel
predictor of market baskets from sequential purchase histories: our predictions
are based on similarity matching in order to identify similar purchase habits
among the complete shopping histories of all customers. Our contributions are
as follows: (1) We propose similarity matching based on subsequential dynamic
time warping (SDTW) as a novel predictor of market baskets. Thereby, we can
effectively identify cross-customer patterns. (2) We leverage the Wasserstein
distance for measuring the similarity among embedded purchase histories. (3) We
develop a fast approximation algorithm for computing a lower bound of the
Wasserstein distance in our setting. An extensive series of computational
experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. The accuracy of
identifying the exact market baskets based on state-of-the-art decision rules
from the literature is outperformed by a factor of 4.0.

phase. In the pre-training phase, we separately train two deep neural networks:
a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a generator $\G$ that captures the
data distribution of a given image set, and an auto-encoder (AE) network with
an encoder $\EN$ that compresses images following the estimated distribution by
GAN. In the solving phase, given a noisy image $x=\mathcal{P}(x^*)$, where
$x^*$ is the target unknown image, $\mathcal{P}$ is an operator adding an
addictive, or multiplicative, or convolutional noise, or equivalently given
such an image $x$ in the compressed domain, i.e., given $m=\EN(x)$, we solve
the optimization problem
  \[
  z^*=\underset{z}{\mathrm{argmin}} \|\EN(\G(z))-m\|_2^2+\lambda\|z\|_2^2
  \] to recover the image $x^*$ in a generative way via
$\hat{x}:=\G(z^*)\approx x^*$, where $\lambda>0$ is a hyperparameter. The GE
model unifies the generative capacity of GANs and the stability of AEs in an
optimization framework above instead of stacking GANs and AEs into a single
network or combining their loss functions into one as in existing literature.
Numerical experiments show that the proposed model outperforms several

interpretability is crucial. However, current benchmark machine learning
datasets either have little hierarchical or compositional structure, or the
structure is not known. This gap impedes precise analysis of a network's
representations and thus hinders development of new methods that can learn such
properties. To address this gap, we developed a new benchmark dataset with
known hierarchical and compositional structure. The Hangul Fonts Dataset (HFD)
is comprised of 35 fonts from the Korean writing system (Hangul), each with
11,172 blocks (syllables) composed from the product of initial consonant,
medial vowel, and final consonant glyphs. All blocks can be grouped into a few
geometric types which induces a hierarchy across blocks. In addition, each
block is composed of individual glyphs with rotations, translations, scalings,
and naturalistic style variation across fonts. We find that both shallow and
deep unsupervised methods only show modest evidence of hierarchy and
compositionality in their representations of the HFD compared to supervised
deep networks. Supervised deep network representations contain structure
related to the geometrical hierarchy of the characters, but the compositional
structure of the data is not evident. Thus, HFD enables the identification of
shortcomings in existing methods, a critical first step toward developing new
machine learning algorithms to extract hierarchical and compositional structure

it is a challenging task for human medical experts to explore all of these
publications. Text mining offers a computational approach to investigate
neurology literature and capture meaningful patterns. The overarching goal of
this study is to provide a new perspective on case reports of neurological
disease and syndrome analysis over the last six decades using text mining.
  Methods: We extracted diseases and syndromes (DsSs) from more than 65,000
neurology case reports from 66 journals in PubMed over the last six decades
from 1955 to 2017. Text mining was applied to reports on the detected DsSs to
investigate high-frequency DsSs, categorize them, and explore the linear trends
over the 63-year time frame.
  Results: The text mining methods explored high-frequency neurologic DsSs and
their trends and the relationships between them from 1955 to 2017. We detected
more than 18,000 unique DsSs and found 10 categories of neurologic DsSs. While
the trend analysis showed the increasing trends in the case reports for top-10
high-frequency DsSs, the categories had mixed trends.
  Conclusion: Our study provided new insights into the application of text
mining methods to investigate DsSs in a large number of medical case reports
that occur over several decades. The proposed approach can be used to provide a
macro level analysis of medical literature by discovering interesting patterns
and tracking them over several years to help physicians explore these case

  Evaluation",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper discusses the concept of cyber defence exercises -CDX- that are
very important tool when it comes to enhancing the safety awareness of
cyberspace, testing an organization's ability to put up resistance and respond
to different cyber events to establish the secure environment, gathering
empirical data related to security, and looking at the practical training of
experts on this subject. The exercises can give ideas to the decision makers
about the precautions in the cybersecurity area and to the officials,
institutions, organizations, and staff who are responsible on the cyber tools,
techniques, and procedures that can be developed for this field. In the cyber
defense exercises, the scenarios that are simulated closest to reality which
provides very important contributions by bringing together the necessity of
making the best decisions and management capabilities under the cyber crisis by
handling stress and coordinated movement as a team. The objective of this paper
is to address the issue from a scientific point of view by setting out the
stages of planning, implementation, and evaluation of these exercises, taking
into account and comparing international firefighting exercises. Another aim of
the work is to be able to reveal the necessary processes that are required for
all kind of cyber exercises, regardless of the type, although the processes
involved vary according to the target mass of the planned exercise.

challenging problem in the financial markets. The challenge arises because of
high dimensionality, limited observations, changing data distributions, and a
low signal-to-noise ratio. High dimensionality can be dealt with using robust
feature selection or dimensionality reduction, but limited observations often
result in a model that overfits due to the large parameter space of most deep
neural networks. We propose a generative model for financial time series, which
allows us to train deep learning models on millions of simulated paths. We show
that our generative model is able to create realistic paths that embed the
underlying structure of the markets in a way stochastic processes cannot.

Everything, should be compactified into elliptically fibered threefolds or
fourfolds of Calabi-Yau. Such manifolds have an elliptic curve as a fiber, and
their bases may have singularities. We considered orbifold as simplest non-flat
construction. Blow up modes of orbifold singularities can be considered as
coordinates of complexified Kahler moduli space. Quiver diagrams are used for
discribing D-branes near orbifold point. In this case it is possible to
calculate Euler character defined through $\mbox{Ext}^i(A,B)$ groups and
coherent sheaves $A, B$ over projective space, which are representations of
orbifold space after blowing up procedure. These fractional sheaves are
characterized by $Q_0$, $Q_2$ and $Q_4$ Ramon-Ramon charges, which have special
type, calculated for $C^3/Z_3$ case. BPS central charge for $C^3/Z_3$ orbifold
is calculated through Ramon-Ramon charges and Picard-Fuchs periods.

models. The idea to study these models came from the fact that
spring-electrical models have been successfully used for networks
visualization. A good network visualization usually implies that nodes similar
in terms of network topology, e.g., connected and/or belonging to one cluster,
tend to be visualized close to each other. Therefore, we assumed that the
Euclidean distance between nodes in the obtained network layout correlates with
a probability of a link between them. We evaluate the proposed method against
several popular baselines and demonstrate its flexibility by applying it to
undirected, directed and bipartite networks.

  Spike-based Backpropagation","17 pages, 10 Figures, 1 table",,,,"cs.NE cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative to current
artificial neural networks to enable low-power event-driven neuromorphic
hardware. Spike-based neuromorphic applications require processing and
extracting meaningful information from spatio-temporal data, represented as
series of spike trains over time. In this paper, we propose a method to
synthesize images from multiple modalities in a spike-based environment. We use
spiking auto-encoders to convert image and audio inputs into compact
spatio-temporal representations that is then decoded for image synthesis. For
this, we use a direct training algorithm that computes loss on the membrane
potential of the output layer and back-propagates it by using a sigmoid
approximation of the neuron's activation function to enable differentiability.
The spiking autoencoders are benchmarked on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST and achieve
very low reconstruction loss, comparable to ANNs. Then, spiking autoencoders
are trained to learn meaningful spatio-temporal representations of the data,
across the two modalities - audio and visual. We synthesize images from audio
in a spike-based environment by first generating, and then utilizing such
shared multi-modal spatio-temporal representations. Our audio to image
synthesis model is tested on the task of converting TI-46 digits audio samples
to MNIST images. We are able to synthesize images with high fidelity and the
model achieves competitive performance against ANNs.

  on modified steady state ""hot wire"" method","16 pages, 6 figures",,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The convection plays a very important role in heat transfer when MEMS work
under air environment. However, traditional measurements of convection heat
transfer coefficient require the knowledge of thermal conductivity, which makes
measurements complex. In this work, a modified steady state ""hot wire"" (MSSHW)
method is proposed, which can measure the heat transfer coefficient of
microwires' convection without the knowledge of thermal conductivity. To verify
MSSHW method, the convection heat transfer coefficient of platinum microwires
was measured in the atmosphere, whose value is in good agreement with values by
both traditional measurement methods and empirical equations. Then, the
convection heat transfer coefficient of microwires with different materials and
diameters were measured by MSSHW. It is found that the convection heat transfer
coefficient of microwire is not sensitive on materials, while it increases from
86 W/(m$^2$K) to 427 W/(m$^2$K) with the diameter of microwires decreasing from
120 ${\mu}$m to 20 ${\mu}$m. Without knowing thermal conductivity of
microwires, the MSSHW method provides a more convenient way to measure the
convective effect.
